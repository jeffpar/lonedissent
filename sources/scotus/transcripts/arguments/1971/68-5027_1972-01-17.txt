PROCEED I W G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

first today in No, 6P-5027, Ailcens against California.
Mr. Amsterdam, you may proceed whenever you"re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAMf FSO. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR.-AMSTERDAM:

Thanh you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May

it please the Court:
This case

and the three cases to follow present the

question whether the infliction of the penalty of death on
each of the petitioners is a cruel and unusual punishment
within the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.
The cases present a range of factual situations.

In

this first Aikens case, the death penalty was inflicted upon
a multiple murder for an intentional killing of a particularly
atrocious sort.
•In the second case, the Furman case, we have a killing
in the course of a burglary,murder which may or may not have
been intentional which is not attended by the same aggravated
circumstances.
And in the third and fourth cases, Jackson and Branch,
we have tbs infliction of the death penaltv for the crime of
rape „
The briefs of the parties and of the amici canvass a
bread .range of considerations under the Eighth and Fourteenth

4
Amendments.

Bat I think there emerges from the briefs the

clear impression that the central issue in this case, the real
nub of this controversy, is the scope and indeed the propriety
of judicial review of legislative, State legislative
determinations to use the penalty of death.
The briefs on behalf of the respondents primarily
support the death penalty on the ground that if exists on the
statute books of 41 States and of the Federal Government.
that it has been put there by the Legislatures of

And

States

and the Federal Government; and that those Legislatures are
the primary keepers of the national conscience in penal matters;
and the elected representatives of the people, whoso judgment
is entitled to respect.
I agree with all of that.
But, for me, I think that is the beginning and not
the end of analysis under the Eighth Amendment.

Because

judicial review of legislative judgment is just as inevitable
as it is difficult under a Constitution which commits to the
courts protection of the individual, under guarantees such as
cruel and unusual punishment or due process or emial protection
of the laws.
Precisely because these guarantees are fundamental
statements of the most basic principles of our society, the
least confined to the narrow historical circumstances- that
gave them birth,’ they'rs cast in general terms.

Their generality

5
makes •them difficult to interpret, and it also creates the risk,,
which Hr. Justice Frankfurter frequently warned the Court
about, that the Court may read its own dispositions into the
Constitution.
But, at the same time, these very general prescriptions
are the bedrock of a Constitution designed to endure for time.
And to give continuing and constant expression to the notion
that there are limitations on the rower of government to deal
with individuals.
Guarantees such as cruel and unusual punishment and
due process and equal protection are broad statements in grand
form, oast for an unforeseeable future and intended to be
construed to give continuing protection to the limitations upon
goversfflsnta1 power.
Such protections to the individual are not likely
often to be added to the Constitution by the amending process,
because when they're most needed they are least likely to
command the political approval necessary to add thorn, and so
they're put in general form and they’re committed to courts
to construe, as times change during the life of the nation
as envisaged by the Constitution,.
I conclude from that that, although deference and
circumspection to legislative judgment is vital, that abnegation
judicial to legislative judgment is impermissible.
Because the very existence of a clause like the

Eighth, Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment
belies the idea that legislatures are totally free, in their
choice of penalizing methods.
And if one thing is plain, it is that the cruel and
unusual punishment clause is a restriction on legislation.

In

the context of American Government, where penal sanctions are
.primarily legislative, it can only have meant to limit
legislative means.

And this Court has, in fact, three times

applied it to invalidate legislation in the only cases, in fact,
in which it has applied the clause to vindicate any claim.
The question is, what are those limitations on
legislative judgment?

Iiow stringent are they?

And where does

this Court get the standards by which to determine?
•The problem of standards is critical because of the
generality of cruel and unusual punishment that I described.
The language is not crystalline, it's not clear, you can’t
look at a punishment and see whether it’s cruel, you can’t
look at it and see whether .it’s 'unusual.

And history, although

relevant, cannot be controlling, because of the evolutionary
nature of the guarantee and its projection into the future, as
I've described it.
i’hs State of California, the States of Georgia and
Texas to scae extent, in their briefs, have all made the point
that at the time that the Eighth Amendment was written, capital
punishment was widely in use? the Fifth Amendment clearly

7
envisages that there will be capital cases.

The Federal

Congress put capital statutes on the books.

All this mis­

conceives # X think, our submission to the Court, which is not
that 'when the Eighth Amendment was ratified in 1791 it was
intended then and there to do away with capital punishment,
any more than it was intended then and there to do away with
whippings or brandings or cutting off of ears, or any more
than the equal protection clause, when originally put into the
Constitution, was intended to give equal right to indigents or
to women.
0

In your view, Hr. Amsterdam, would Congress have

authority to legislate in this field concerning the States?
Under the Eighth Amendment»
HR. AMSTERDAM;

Would Congress have the power to

prohibit the death penalty under the Eighth Amendment?
Q

Yes.

MR. AMSTERDAM:
Q

Oh, sure, Your Honor.

In the States?

MR. AMSTERDAM:

In the States, yes, Your Honor.

But

we go further than that, and —
Q

I know you do.

But I say would Congress —• has

Congress done anything in the past?
MR. AMSTERDAM: With regard to capital punishment in
the States?
Q

Yes.

MR. AMSTERDAM:

No, Your Honor* There has been a bill

submitted by Senator Hart and Congressman Celler which would
impose a moratorium on executions*
Q

Bur that didn't pass?

MR. AMSTERDAM:

It has not. even come to committee

hearing, Your Honor.
Q

Congress's power would be under Section 5 of the

Fourteenth Amendment, would it?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart.

The problem of construing the Eighth Amendment
emerges, I think, from what 1 have said:

that if the language

isn’t clear and if history is not controlling, where does the
Court get standards?

Where does it find the bases for judgment

in determining whether legislation is cruel or unusual?
The primary problem with formu 1ations that you
frequently find in lower court cases, such as the notion that
a punishment may shock the conscience of the court, or be
unnecessarily cruel, or some such thing, is that it invokes
subjective judgment.
And one thing 1 think all the parties here agree on
is that it is not the purpose of t he Constitution to allow the
judges bo write their own penological reflections into it.
The arguments made by the States in these cases to
sustain capital punishment would, 1 think, equally sustain
bra:: ding of confidence men on the forehead with the letter C,

or cutting the hands of of pickpockets, or any atrocious
pun is hsnent;-. .

And these punishments, X think, would plainly

be condemned by the Eighth Amendment; but it behooves us to
ask why;

Is it simply because we would be.shocked, would be

intestinaliy appalled at those punishments, more than the
punishment off death, if we are?
1 don't think so.

I think it is because there are

objective and judicially cognizable bases for making a deter­
mination under the Eighth Amendment.

And in our brief we have

tried to set forth what those standards, what those objective
standards for judicial judgment are,.
Specifically, we think that the question under the
Eighth Amendment is whether the punishment applied to a
particular individual would, by all available objective
indication?., be unacceptable to general contemporary conscience
and standards off decency if it were generally and uniformly
applied, to any reasonable proportion of persons subject to
penalty for that crime.
Q

As I understand the statute in the first ease,

the judge had the discretion to impose it or not to impose it,
is that right?
MS, AMSTERDAM;

That is true, Mr, Justice Douglas.

That is true in all four of these cases, that that penalty is
sretionary with either judge or jury, depending on who tries
the case

10

Q

That8s true in each of .the four?

'

MR, AMSTERDAM: Each of the four,
Q

So there’s no statement of State policy in the

case you’re now arguing that all people who comm.it murder shall
he executed?
MR, AMSTERDAM:

Mo.

Indeed, the State policy is

simply that the penalty of death be available, not that it be
imposed on any particular murderer or any particular class of
murderers.
Q

Is there anything in this record which shows the

kinds of people to which the death penalty

on which the

death penalty is imposed?
MR, AMSTERDAM:
Q

There is nothing in this —

I mean their annual income, their race* their

religion, their social status, or are we just in the dark on
that?
MR. AMSTERDAMs There is nothing in this record, nor,
indeed, in the record of any of the cases before the Court,
which discloses that.

Judicially noticeable findings, I believe,

set out in our brief reflect with some imprecision those
factors, but there is nothing in the record that supports them.
The State of California has thrown into its brief a
good deal of material which is neither in the record nor
judicially noticeable.
Thors are some published materials, such as the racial

II
statistics, which I think are judicially noticeable.

But

there is nothing in the record, Mr. Justice Douglas, on that.
The reason why v;e urge that the standard I have just
described is the proper standard under the Fight!) Amendment,
that what this Court must do is to look and see whether the
punishment inflicted in a particular case would be tolerable,
acceptable to prevailing standards of decency if generally
applied.
It is essentially threefold.

I think three

considerations commend that standard to the Court, and 1 should
say I take the Court's time at this point to talk about the
Eighth Amendment standards because this Court has very little
developed in the theory and in the concepts of the Eighth
Amendment, and the parties are, I think, more in disagreement
about the theory of the Eighth Amendment than they are about any
other aspect of the case.
I think the three reasons are this:

first of all,

o

our conception of the theory of the Eighth Amendment takes a
proper court of the different nature and the different roles
under the Constitution of legislatures and courts.

Legis-

latures are not primarily concerned with the application of
penalties in particular cases.
As Mr. Justice Douglas’s question suggests, the
legislature, with regard to capital punishment, had simply said
that earth ie: an available penalty? it may never be used.

It

12
may rarely and infrequently be used»
Q

It is —

Are there.any States left in which the legis­

lature has said that the death penalty inexorably follows
from the conviction of a certain offense?
si any.

There used to be

Are there any left?
MR. AMSTERDAM; There are a number of them left. To

lay knowledge there is only one capital crime in the United
States for which there are any men on Death Row.

Most of them

are obsolete, such as treason against the States, and that
sort of thing, Mr» Justice Stewart.
The one crime is the California crime, 4500 of the
California Penal Code, is assault by a life-term inmate upon
a non-inmate, where the person assaulted dies»

That is the

only mandatory capital crime as to which I knew there is any
one on Death Row in this country.
0

But there are other statutes on the books?

MR. AMSTERDAM; There are other statutes, essentially
obsolete, which impose this.
0

Well, in many States this used to be true of

first-degree murder or deliberate murder.
MR. AMSTERDAM;

Oh, yes.

It has been a development

th at the death penalty has been made discretionary.
0

And there's no State left where that is any

longer true, except in the exceptional kind of circumstance

ordinary crimes that capital punishment is imposed for.

It's about ten years ago, isn't it, that Congress

abolished the mandatory death penalty for the District of

MR. AMSTERDAM:

Under the Celler-Keating bill, X think it was

MR. AMSTERDAM: That * s correct..

The District of

Columbia and Mew York were the last two in the United States
to go, the last two mandatory capital sentencing provisions to
go.

Q

Are there any standards in any of these cases

for the orercise of discretion by the judge or jury?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

None, Mr. Justice Douglas.

It is

entirely optional.
Q

As a matter of California law, is the discretion

reviewable, exercise of ihe discretion reviewabie?
MR. AMSTERDAM: The Aikens case was tried, and
sentencing dona by a judge.

In a jury-tried case in California

14
the trial judge may set aside the jury's verdict»

The Califor­

nia Supreme Court may not review the sentence, whether imposed
by a. judge or a jury.
The second reason why I think our theory or standard
of the Eighth .Amendment concept is up to the Court is that it
serves a proper function in the Eighth Amendment to the
Constitution of a democracy.

Because in any democracy it is

not. at all likely that the legislature will put onto the
statute hooks a penalty which is cruel, which is unacceptable
to public conscience in a generally applicable uniform fashion.
A statute which is going to be generally applied,
which would be repugnant to public conscience if generally
applied, will not command enough public acceptance to get on
the statute books in the first place.
The problem in a democracy is that legislation may
be enacted in such a form that it can be arbitrarily,
selectively, spettily applied to a few outcast priors, whose
political position is so weak and whose personal situation is
•30 unpopular, and who are so ugly that public revulsion,
which would follow the uniform application of the penalties
applied tc them,doesn't follow in these few outcast preachers,
and they are condemned to that punishment.
That we are saying essentially is that a punishment
cast in a form so that it can ba used this way comes to the
-J’c art suspect oncer the Eighth Amendment, and

that where it is

actually applied, so infrequently, so incredibly rarely, as
the death penalty is, that the suspicion materialises and the
penalty is identifiable as a cruel or unusual punishment.
‘this is no new constitutional conception.

I ’m merely

saying nothing more than what Mr. Justice Stone said, in footno'
4 of Caroline Products, which is that:

where legislation is

cast in a form such as is unlikely to make it politically
remediable, such as to stabilise the ordinary political
processes that keep the legislature acting decently and keep
legislation reflective of the public conscience, then a
particular obligation devolves on the Court to assess the
constitutionality of that legislation.
The third reason why I think our theory of the Eighth
Amendment commends itself to the Court is that it doss not
invite subjective judicial judgment.

It does not ask this

Court to put itself in tbs position of a superlegislature and
decide matters of penological policy.
In fact, our theory, I believe, offers the only
alternative to subjective judicial judgment, because if one
looks for a moment at the grounds on which the States seek to
support capital punishment, that it is

that retribution is

a permissible legislative aim and that, in some cases,
retribution requires killing people, that deterrences are
permissible legislative aim, and a legislature could find that
itavitri punishment had come deterrent efficacy, you immediately

see that, the same arguments could and doubtless would be made
if -

he legislature prescribed boiling in oil as a punishment

for a crime.

The legislature might say:

thatss a horrible

crime; you ought to boil them in oil if they do that.

That's

the only fit retribution for that crime.
And the legislature might says
awful thing? we ought to stop that.

Welly that's just an

And the only way to really

make it horrible and prevent people from doing it is if we
threaten them with boiling in oil,.

So we're going to boil

them in oil if they do it.
And the States would be able to make essentially the
same arguments that they are making here against capital
punishment — in favor of capital punishment.
would not foe sustained.

Those arguments

But why would they not foe sustained?

Is it because boiling in oil is somehow more shocking to the
digestive system, to the intestinal reaction of people or
particular judges?
I don't think so.

I think it is because any

objective standard which we invite this Court to apply to
capital punishment generally would be offended by boiling in
oil.

And I think it. is offended by any form of infliction

of the death penalty today.
Q

You don't raise the question of the due process

clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Only in the limited sense, Mr.

17
Justice Douglas, that the Fourteenth Amendment applies the
g'uarci.' .fcee of the Eighth Amendment to the States.
Q

That I understand.

MR. AMSTERDAM:

There is not, within the scope, of the

grant of certiorari in this case, any independent due process
question; and the question was not raised below.
Q

At no stage in the proceeding?

MR. AMSTERDAM:
Q

No.

But now that you're interrupted, with respect

to the duo process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, one
of the things that bothers me in these cases is — I think
it’s more than just a matter of semantics

is the fact that

in that due process clause the deprivation of life is
expressly mentioned and, at least by negative implication, is

expressly permitted:

no State shall deprive any person of

his life, liberty, or property without duo process of law.
There’s another express, almost identical mention

in the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and
indeed I think it's in the Fifth Amendment that there’s a
reference to a capital case, with implicit approval explicitly
in the Constitution of the United States.
And this, as I say, to me is more than just a
semantic problem.

There are at least three, and there may

be other places in the Constitution? that do not now occur to
me, where the death penalty is mentioned, with implicit approval.

18
ME. AMSTERDAM:

Oh, Mr. Justice Stewart, I think the

1 agree, I think it's score than a semantic problem.

I think

:vc s
Q

bow, we*re not talking about what was the

practice at the time the Constitution was adopted.

1‘m talking

about the words of the Constitution of the United States,
which you're invoking in these cases.
MR. MiSTEKDAMs

Yes, 1 think that's right, Your Honor,

But I think there is a difference between an explicit
permission and simply a negative inference from the fact that
there are certain guarantees that say that if the death
penalty is to be imposed certain procedures must be followed.
There must be a grand jury indictment? that there must be
due process of law.
I don't think that one can say that the language
in the Constitution which, by inference, permits the death
penalty is meant to project a continuing permission of it.
I think all that one can say is that so long as the
death penalty could be imposed at all, or was imposed at all,
it could only be imposed within these restrictions.
And that, I- think/takes us back to the initial
question.

X don't think, and I'm not urging, that when anybody

put any of this language into the Constitution they meant to
put over capital punishment.

X think that what they meant to

do -.mr, to put in several guarantees of rightsx

one, a guarantee

19

against crv.al and unusual punishment, which would grow and
evolve as society grew and evolved; another is a guarantee of
the right to life, liberty, and property, not to have it
taken away without due process of law; the right to prosecution
by indictment, and that sort of thing.
What they said there was, in describing what a
legislature could not do, they said if it seeks to take away
rights, the only inference there is is that then it was
conceived at that time that the State might take away life.
It .can only do it by these procedures.
There’s no projection forward that the notion of the
taking of life is permissible, there is simply a statement
thats

we know now that the taking of life is permissible,

so wherever it is permissible, these guarantees must obtain.

X think there is no consistency in that.

If one

yimply recognises the historical fact that the cruel and
unusual punishment clause does grow and evolve.
Q

Thank you.

HR. AMSTERDAM;

A last point that X think is of some

significance, before I turn to capital punishment itself, is
that our theory of the Eighth Amendment is also not without
historical support.
The Eighth Amendment seems to have been the result
of a confluence of three primary concerns:

a concern against

-excessive punishments, which you sea in English law as far

20

back as the Magna Carta? a concern against the selective
imposition of harsh punishments? and a concern with outright
barbarity.
The most immediately relevant one I think is the
second, the concern against the selective use of harsh criminal
punishments, which immediately led to the English Bill of
Rights provision in 1689, which is now the language of the
Eighth Amendment.

The English Bill of Rights provision was

put there largely as a result of the trial of Titus Oates.
And if you look back at the trial of Oates, what you see is
that the actual punishment imposed on Oates was not barbaric.
It was that he was to be divested as a clergym^f that he was
to bo imprisoned for life, and that he was to be pilloried
•

■ r

and whipped annually on the occasions of the perjuries that
led to his conviction.
And the complaint lodged against that judgment, which
led to the Bill of Rights, was not that it was harsh at a time
when they ware still killing thousands of people? it wasn't
that it was intrinsically barbaric, it was that it was
selective, that this one fellow was singled out and given an
unprecedently harsh punishment.
i..

How, capital punishment in its functioning today is
a precise reflex

.■£' what happened to Titus Oates.

And the blinking of the light leads tile to mention
that since I will be arguing both of the first two cases, I

21
will have to develop part of my constitutional argument in
the second.

But will simply state in this first that the

essence of our argument, applying this theory to the Eighth
Amendment, is that the exceeding contemporary rarity of
capital punishment, the fact that the death penalty, although
allowed by law in an overwhelming majority of American juris­
dictions , is in fact applied more infrequently than any penalty
on our books r and against the background of an ideological
debate that makes it clear that the attrition and use of the
death penalty is a repudiation.
That circumstance presents for us the primary objective
indicator by which this Court can say that not only is it no
longer true, as the Court suggested in Trop v. Dulles, that
the death penalty is still generally accepted, but, to the
contrary, the death penalty is virtually unanimously repudiated
and condemned by the conscience of contemporary society.
How, developing that point factually I think is not
difficult.
The National Crime Commission, in its study three
years ago, pointed out that the most salient characteristic
of capital punishment was the infrequency of its use.

And

every informed commentator who has studied it, perhaps
excepting the respondents in these cases, come to the same
conclusion„
If I may just read Professor Herbert Wechsler5 s

22
description, which 1 think is a fair one:
There is a striking contrast between the broad
extent to which the penalty of death is authorised by law and
the relative infrequency with which the sentences actually
imposed are carried out»

Despite the imperfections in the

data, it is clear that capital punishment is executed only
in a fraction of- the cases where it can be legally imposed»
A fraction that is trivial in quantity and has been steadily
diminishing in recent years»
I should say that we do not rely on the dwindling
to aero of the death penalty in the last few years»

That is,

of course, in large measure the result of judicial stays.
But what I would point out is that even before the
national campaign began, which secured those judicial stays in
1967, during the decade of the Sixties executions in the
United States dropped to an average of about 20 a year, down
from a high of almost 200 and an ordinary norm of 175 or 150
during previous decades,
X should also point out that the number of death
sentences returned by juries during the decade of the Sixties
and through I960 is about 100 a year,
Now, what you5re talking about is a country where
there are 52 jurisdictions competent to impose, capital punish­
ment, and a population of 200 million people; 43 jurisdictions
which actually use the death penalty for seme crimes.

And only

23
100 people convicted of capital punishment, and only 20
actually executed,
1 will, with the Court's pleasure, reserve the
continuation of this theme for the argument in the Furman case,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Very well, Mr. Amsterdam.
Mr. George.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD M. GEORGE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR, GEORGE%

I will try to anticipate the remainder

of Professor Amsterdam's argument to follow in the next case.
The basic issue before the Court is, of course, not
whether the death penalty is socially, morally, or politically
desirable or advantageous, but instead whether there is some
specific provision in the Federal Constitution that bars the
people of the State of California in this case from determining
through their elected representatives that tbs death penalty
should be available as a possible form of punishment for the
offense of murder.
Q

Do you have any information as to the kind of

people that California executes?
HR. GEORGE:

Yes, I certainly do.

In the Appendix

to our brief wo have summarized in very short manner the cases
that'have reached the California Supreme Court in the lastsix years *— vail, since 1965.

We also have certain tables in

our brief indicating the racial makeup of the persons receiving

24
death sentences, or, rather, who are on Death Row now, and
also some data regarding their• socio-economic status, and 1"
will gat into that in some detail.
The petitioner comes here bearing indeed a heavy
burden, that of establishing that the California Legislature
lacks any permissible basis upon which to conclude that the
protection of society requires the availability of the death
penalty for the most serious of crimes, the willful and
malicious taking of human life.

That is that punishment of

death, the form of punishment is as old as the history of man
itself.
Now, Professor' Amsterdam takes the position, or at
least he did ten days ago when ho and I were before the
California Supreme Court on the very same issue here, that
• '

V.

.

even if it could conclusively be established that the death
penalty does deter and save innocent peopled lives thereby
that the death penalty would still be cruel and unusual
punishment, that it would be an impermissible form of punish­
ment.
Q

Well, certainly you would agree, 1 should

suppose, with that argument insofar as it says that deterrence
Is not the sole criteria of whether a punishment is cruel or
unusual?
MR. GEORGE: Well —
Q

So, in other words, Z suppose that disemboweling,

25
burning at the stake, drawing and quartering might all be —
serve aa deterrents»
larceny.

An cl even if you imposed them for petty

But that wouldn't answer the question, would it?
MR. GEORGE:

Well, the one qualification on my remark,

or the one explanation would be that of course the execution
would have to be done in a humane manner.

What I would like

to develop at some length is this Court's treatment of the
concept of cruel and unusual punishment.
I think one of the key aspects of that term, as
defined from the Wiikerson case, through Francis vs. 'Resweber,
is the definition of cruelty in terms of unnecessary cruelty,
unnecessary pain, the wanton infliction of pain.
Q

Weil, then, is it your submission that if it

can be shown that a punishment serves as a deterrent and if,
in a rational person's judgment, that is the appropriate
deterrent, and then if no more pain or torture, is inflicted
in imposing that deterrent than is necessary, then it's
automatically constitutionally valid?
MR. GEORGE:
Q

Yes.

And this would therefore be true of horse­

whipping ' or —
MR. GEORGE:
Q

Mo. Mo.

No.

Unnecessary cruelty, I think,

But I --- if rational people could

conclude that the host deterrent for petty larceny was 50
lashes, then it would not be cruel and unusual, so long as 51

26

lashes were not imposed.

That’s as 1 understand what your

argument is.
MR. GEORGE;

If rational people could so conclude,

I think that the enactment of the Eighth Amendment was intended
to bar certain torturous punishments.

And I don't think that

capital punishments and tortures have to stand or fall together
just because they both existed in 1791.
And I think we start with the proposition that the
death penalty was clearly constitutional during the. period in
which the Eighth Amendment was adopted ? as Your Honor pointed
out, there is specific mention in the Fifth Amendment of the
taking of life, of capital offenses, and of course there were
many capital offenses enacted both in the Federal Government
and the State Legislatures immediately preceding and following
the adoption of the cruel and unusual punishment.
Go one must ask rhetorically:

Can the Constitution

be unconstitutional in its recognition of capital offenses and
the taking of life?
And that for years —
Q

Do you think that "unusual5* means what it meant

than or what it means now? . The word "unusual”?
MR. GEORGE: Some scholars, particularly the article
we’ve cited by Mr. Granucci, seem to indicate that there was a
very definite lack of precision in the use of the term, and
that they might have meant something different at the time that

,

27
they ware first adopted in Britain, and might have been mistaken
to mean something different at the time they were used in this
country.
Q

What do you think?

MR. GSORGE;

I think that "cruel and unusual" means

two things, basically, an defined by this Court’s opinions,

trying to synthesise the various opinions from Wilkerson in
1878 to Francis vs,. Reswabsr in 1947; and that .13 as follows:
That a punishment wi11 be held unconstitutional if
it is both cruel and unusual either as, first, a punishment
inherently cruel and inherently unusual in its form.
Nov;, Walkers on, as I stated, speaks in terms of
punishments of torture and all others involving unnecessary
cruelty.

Now, this was cited with approval in In re .Kemmler,

which decision added the definition that punishments are
cruel where they involve torture or a lingering death, but
the punistessnt of death is not itself cruel? cruelty implies'
something barbarous, more than the extinguishment of life.
Now, in Weems this Court eruoted with approval both
the Wfilkeraon definition and the language from Keacmler, and
then in Francis vs. Resweber proceeded to define cruelty in
terms of the infliction of wanton or unnecessary pain, and
said :
"The cruelty against which the Constitution protects
a convicted man is cruelty inherent in the method of punish-

28_

ment, not the necessary suffering involved in any method
employed to extinguish life humanely.”
So
Q

With all due respect,. Mr. George, 1 was talking

about the word '’unusual”.
MR. GEORGS:
Q

In ''unusual6', I think what we *—

Hot the xvord "cruel ”»

MR. GEORGE?

~~ mean in "unusual" is something that

is not customary for that type, of offense.
Q

As of then or as of now?

MR. GEORGE: As of 1791.
X would like to, in some detail, deal with this
argument of Professor Amsterdam’s, that the words somehow
change their meaning from year to ysar.
Q

Well, my question is:

You say that whatever

was not unusual in 1791 is not unusual today?
MR. GEORGE;

I*m saying that whatever was not unusual

and -cruel. There might have been certain things that were
usual in 1791 that were cruel.
Q

Well, you just will not stick with "unusual”?

you have to tie "cruel” with it all the time.
MR. GEORGE:

I think that the txvo concepts are

interneshed.

0

Well, why is the word "unusual” in there?

MR. GEORGE:

1 get "Unusual” in there because I think

29
the-,';, if it was not a customary punishment, such as W3eras ,
that’s a very good example, it was a punishment less than life,
perhaps -one might call it cruel, but the Court seamed to
•tress that it was highly unusual; something totally out of
keeping with our concept of common-law punishments.

It

Involved certain civil disabilities and fine, while a whitecollar crime,in chains for 15 years.
Q

To gat back to the word "unusual”t is there any

State that still has hanging?
MR. GEORGE:

I believe that that's an option in the

State of Utah.
0

Any other States?

MR. GEORGE:

I'm not sure which States do have it.

X think Utah even has shooting as an option.
Q

Of course you didn’t have gas chambers in 1791.

MR. GEORGE: That’s right.

And X think that the

term ~~
0

Well, how am 1 going to measure the gas chamber?

MR. GEORGE:
Q

Pardon ms?

How am I going to measure the gas chamber?

Because it wasn’t

you said X have to consider what was not

unusual in 1791.

I can’t do that with gas chambers.

HR. GEORGE:

We're not talking, I think, about

methods of execution, we’re talking about a certain kind of
c.uy-'rtiorH:.ity..

there may be certain types of tortures

30
that t/sre not available either in 1791, and that doesn't mean
that they aren’t covered.
But I think basically the Eighth Amendment was
intended to apply against the came- types of things in 1791

m it is today*

And in fact, as recently as 1958, this Court,

in Trop vs. Dulles, regarded that the death penalty has been
employed throughout our history and in a day in which it is
still widely accepted it cannot be said to violate the
constitutional concept of cruelty.
The Court noted the imprecision, certainly, in the
'use of those words.

But I think that through its opinions it

has come up with this definition.

1 gave the first part of it.

The second principle, I think, as far as cruel and unusual is
concerned, would involve punishment that is not inherentlv
f
i

cruel and unusual in its form, but it is unconstitutional as;
grossly excessive as applied either in relationship to the j ,
seriousness of a particular offense or in relationship to a
status which is not involved in uncompelled acts, such as was
involved in the Robinson vs. California case.
And 1 think if these tests are applied to the
offerers of murder it's clear that there is no cruel and •
nuuuual punishment.

Certainly not under our humane method.

There's no intentional cruelty.

In fact, the death that comes

prisoner is perhaps frequently less cruel than the
north by rrtarri causes that comes to us all eventually.

31

So
Q

Except nobody knows.

MR. GEORGE:

Nobody knows, but with the State of cur

medical knowledge today X think that we can assume that since
death comes within a matter of seconds, that whatever might be
the physical reflex actions that Professor Amsterdam has
chosen to —
Q

Is the gas chamber faster than a bullet?

Which was the way they used to do it.
MR. GEORGEs

I don't think speed is the only criterion.

Apparently, according to medical authorities, it does involve
less pain that any other method.
found that in the past.

And this Court has certainly

And 1 don't think there is anything that

petitioner has been able to show that leads us to believe that
there is involved some necessary, intentional torturing.
The test is whether there's any cruelty beyond the
perhaps all punishment is cruel.
might be cruel, especially for life,

Putting a man behind bars
But that's not the test;

the test is unnecessary cruelty.
Now, although this Court in Trop vs. Dulles went out
of its way- to uphold the constitutionality of the death
penalty, petitioner seises upon certain language in that
opinion — the evolving standards of decency,that mark the
progress of a maturing society — as some sort of talisraanic
death knell for 300 years of capital punishment in this

32
country*

‘fftoae wards did represent the opinion of four members
of this Court at that time, one member of whom makes up part
of the constituency of the present Court.
Certainly the meaning of cruel and unusual is not

static.

But ws emphasise that these words cannot change from

year to year.

1 don't know if Professor Amsterdam has in

mind the meaning of cruel and unusual in 1962 or '65, when
petitioner committed his crimes, or 1969, when the judgment
of the California Supreme Court below was affirmed, or in 1972.
But we vigorously reject the notion that these terms
■'cruel and unusual” can change epheraerally from year to year.
Were this the ease, indeed, our evolving standards of decency
night regress, as they did in Germany in the 1940’s and *50*s.
What if burning in oil or some other tortures did,
it: fact become a popular vogue in the minds of our populace;
would that mean that there were suddenly constitutional under
a fluid and meaningless Eighth Amendment?

I don’t think so.

And just because some rather primitive corporal
punishment;; wore in use at the time the Eighth Amendment was
enacted does not mean that they and capital punishment must
stand or fall together.

The framers of the Eighth Amendment

may very well have intended to outlaw some of those punishments,
and, indeed, those punishments, although they might have

a v. rv iv*>d -saraa t in;a after tie. enactment of the Eighth Amendment,

33

Court, unlike capital punishment, whose methods of infliction
at least have been sanctified.
And there was never any sanctifying of tortures in
the Constitution as there is of capital punishment in the
Fifth Amendment• s use of capital offenses and its uses of
taking life-,
Q

Of course, the Fifth Amendment also talks about

jeopardy of limb, in the double jeopardy provision:

And I

suppose you wouldn't use that to argue that today government
could cut off the arm of a thief, would you?

And without

violating the Eighth Amendment?
MR. GEORGE:

No.

But I don't think that's what the

£ramors of the Eighth Amendment intended to sanctify, either.
X think they were just

not be cruel and unusual today.
would be.

That might

1 certainly don’t think it

And that’s perhaps what they had in mind.
I think that petitioner therefore is quite incorrect

in stating that if we say that the death penalty is all right,
that means that burning in oil and other tortures are
necessarily all right too.
Mow, I’d like to take a second tack, though.

Even if

we assume that the meaning of cruel and unusual can change
brc::.i decade to decade, progress and perhaps regress, I would
submit that our standards have not evolved to the point where
the imposition of the death penalty for the offense of murder
is inconsistent with our standards.
X don’t, know what’s changed since 1791 or since the
1950 decision of this Court in Trap vs. Dulles to alter the
fact that capital punishment is part of our moral and
religious and philosophical heritage, and has always been
recognised as such.
hirtd, indeed. Professor Amsterdam’s fixation with that
phrase, "evolving standards'*, is quite understandable.

It

provides the only arguable escape from the historical reality
. t capital punishment being recognised as a legitimate form of
for 300 years in this nation? and for thousands of

35
years in oar heritage.
It* • not clear again which point petitioner wants
y.s to focus on in determining these standards, but one thing
is clears

he conveniently chooses to ignore the fact that

41 of our 50 States have capital punishment, that the Federal
Gouorament does, that 0 States have experimented with abolition
of the death penalty and rejected it.
The fact that there is widespread support for the
death penalty.

It*s not confined to bloodthirsty prosecutors

or vengeful police officers.

Wa cited religious authorities

fao think that capital punishment is permissible.

The polls

certainly show a majority of our population in favor of it.
Also ignored is the almost annual ritual in the
California Legislature by which a bill is introduced to abolish
the death penalty and it's then defeated, usually in committee,
sometimes on the floor.

Also ignored is the fact that the

California Legislature in 1970 added a new capital offenser
the Federal Government did in 1961 and '65.
So what does Professor Amsterdam choose to focus his
attention on?

He cites at great length in his brief what

iioaaaibique and Liechtenstein are doing.
that relevance does this have to determine what our
\

provision, adopted in 1791, means with reference to cruel and
unusual punishment?

Different countries have different social

canditionf.: necessitating different forms of punishment,

36

keeping in mind their own needs for the protection of their
.societies.

And, most significantly, none of those nations

have abolished the death penalty judicially, none to my
knowledge»
Arid petitioner fails to even show any trend in this
regard,

There haven't been in recent years a oreat flurry of

jurisdictions rejecting capital punishment. To quote Professor
Packer, this is not a time "for due process by head count”.
And what is particularly ridiculous is for petitioner
in his brief, although I notice he sort of abandons the position
here today, to focus upon the small number of executions as a
supposed indication of the declining popular acceptance of the
death penalty.
Row, at most, the number of executions, which has been
declining, is an indicator perhaps of the evolving standards
of cur judiciary who have chosen jto issue stays, but it is not
an indication of the popular feeling,

A much more accurate

barometer of the evolving standards of our times are the
juries who

consistently, steadily, and even increasingly in

California are returning death penalty verdicts.
And X think this is keyed, because — and there were
36 in 1970 sentenced to State prison under sentence of death
in California.

And the key thing here is as Witherspoon

one of the most important functions any jury can

terterm in mating a selection between life and death is to

37
maintain a link between contemporary comiminity values and the
penal system',, and1 that is what our jury system is doing.
Q

It is suggested some place in these briefsf

which I read over the weekend, that one reason juries these days
are imposing the death penalty with a little more liberality
is that they think that the penalty will not he carried out.
It’s a statement of a prosecutor in New Jersey or Pennsylvania*
I think.

Did you read that in the brief?
MR. GEORGEt

1 read that some place, too,- in the
I don't agree with that at all.

I don’t

I think that has to assume that the juries violate

their oaths, and I don’t think that there is any basis in fact
for that.
There are a lot of allegations made by Professor
Amsterdam to that effect and other effects that I think do
not support —
Q

This is some prosecutor who said that.

MR. GEORGE :
that.

X don’t ac?ree with his observation on

And neither my own experience nor anything I’ve read

supports that.
And I think the key flaw in this whole approach of
petitloner fee the evolving standards problem is this:

if

there is this great trend, this great movement away from
capital punishment, as far as our values are concerned, why
is that not reflected in. our democratically enacted legislation?

Why is it, that 41 States have chosen to keep it?
row, Professor Amsterdam would have you believe that
these people are so unpopular that nobody is going to act on
their behalf.

Well, I don't think that's the case.

Bills

are introduced to abolish the death penalty all the time.
In fact, Congress will often act at the behest of one single
individual, perhaps an alien subject to deportation, without
any great resources, and will enact special legislation allowing
that alien to stay in the country.

We all knov? of such bills.

So there isn't any such situation that these people
are so unpopular they have no —
Q

You certainly aren't going to put this on that

level, are you?
HR. GEORGS:
Q

I will with respect to the —

You would put the right of a man to live on the

level of a private bill to let an alien stay in the country?
You don't have to go that far.
■MR. GEORGE:

1 would put it on this level, with all

due respect, Your Honor, as fax" as the ability of a solitary
individual, whether it is for his right to remain in the
country or his right to remain alive, to get legislation
enacted for his benefit under our democratic process of
government.
X think that basically what Professor Amsterdam
:hws:::.a to do here in ignoring all these indicia of the popular

39
acceptance of the death penalty, he seeks to consider himself
C07U3 sort of self-appointed guardian of the evolving standards
of decency.

He and his co-counsel, they know what the truth

is and we’re wrong»

They have the truth, the evolving standards,

and all these other indications should be disregarded, I think,
in his opinion.
Mow, 1 also object, when it comes to the issue of
burden of proof, to petitioner’s attitude that somehow the
State has an obligation to establish affirmatively that there
is soiae aim of punishment accomplished by the death penalty
that would not be served equally well by the imposition of a
life term.

I don’t think that this is the question.

I

think if you get into that thicket, you will have the problem
of deciding;

can a Stats justify that a life term without

possibility of parols accomplishes something that life will
notV

Does life accomplish something that a fired term of years

will not?

Does prison accomplish something that jail won’t?

Jjjid. a fine that probation won’t?
I think this is really asking this Court to become
a superlegislature, on a Federal-State relationship to boot.
Mow, the basis of petitioner’s argument must be,
indeed, that there is no permissible reason fox* the legislature
to conclude that there is a permissible aim of punishment
served, by the death penalty.
a reasonable basis doss exist.

And I think that it’s clear that
I won't belabor at length the

40
matter that we8ve set forth in our brief in great detail.
Obviously, the first ain of punishment,rehabilitation ,
is not served? but those persons had been found unrehabilitafcablv

as Ailcens is, according to the unanimous testimony of the
psychiatrists.
We nave set forth evidence of deterrence.

Our

burden isn't to establish deterrence, but we have shown that
chore is a reasonable basis upon which the legislature can
conclude that the death penalty does deter.

Prisoners have

made statements, not only to police officers but to reporters
or to each other? defendants have said, one to the other, during

a holdup; c;Don't shoot the victim, you'll get us both fried.8’
Well, there’s a man who is alive today because of the
death penalty.
And the legislature has considered these things, and
the opinion of the State Supreme Court, the. dissenting
justices in the Lave opinion, which we cite, relies very much

on these important statistical figures which Professor Amsterdam
condescendingly refers to as anecdotal impressions of law
enforcement«
He would like to have you believe his authorities,
professors perhaps who have a certain bias to air, but who
disregard some of this pragmatic information.
Now, X would submit, of course, that the death

pcrvlty would be a greater deterrent if executions were being

41
carried out.

In fact, the rise in crime rates since

executions stopped might bear that out, although I don't choose
to rest our position on statistics.
It's clear that the third aim of punishment,
incapacitation or isolation, is not served by a life term.
Prisoners kill fellow prisoners, guards, they escape, they are
out on parole.

And 1 think that retribution is something that

can be considered, as well.
Row, I'd like to briefly point out to the Court that
our briefs do graphically repute these statements by petitioner
that there is discrimination in the imposition of the death
penalty against the mentally deficient, the uneducated, the
poor, racial minorities; our figures show very graphically that
38 percent of the first-degree murder convictions were for
Negroes and only 25 percent of those who got first-degree
murder convictions who received the death penalty were Negroes.
So there is no discrimination.
It's difficult to understand anything discriminatory
in what Professor Amsterdam says, that only a small portion of
condemned

ardersrs , receive the death penalty.

Would he

prefer that they all do, if discretion were abolished? • I can't
see how it's unfair that mass killers like the Manson family,
political assassins like Sirhan, and a three-time killer like
Alkane receives the death penalty and some people do not, and
receive only life.

42

Wow, in conclusion, I *d like to state that petitione
has offerer: us no objective standards for what is cruel and

unusual.

Ha would have this Court become a supsrleqislature

to enact his own personal views of what the evolving standards

of cur society should be.

He's made no showing regarding the

supposed lack of protection afforded by the death penalty.
hnci if his argument ware to prevail, indeed many persons might
lose their lives innocently because of the removal of the
protection of the death penalty,
I don * t have to dwell at length upon Mr.. Aikens9
crimes.

They are, ooncedadly by petitioner, terrible brutal,

no remorse, no mental problem.

He was intelligent, had an

»

education; but he committed three brutal murders.
So, in effect, what 1 would close with is the
statement of Justice Holmes in the Jackman cases

"If a thihg

has been practiced for two hundred years by common consent,
it. will need a strong case for the Fourteenth Amendment to
affect it.'*
And respondent submits that petitioner has not made
a strong case, he has made no case at all.
Respondent joins the comment that we've quoted of
justice Schauer, former Justice of the California Supreme
Court, that all of us involved in the whole process of the
death penalty, even at the appellate level, devoutly wish that
tie death penalty were no longer necessary; but we’ve not yet

43
reached that Utopian state.
Meanwhile, putting aside whatever personal feelings
we might, have, nothing has happened in the 180-year history of
our Constitution- or the 300-year history of capital punishment
in this country which would preclude the people of the various
States from even considering the question, from concluding
that society's protection requires the availability of the dear
penalty as a permissible form of punishment in certain of our
most aggravated offenses.
And, indeed, the cases -that we've set forth here
- x

indicate that it is the aggravated offense that receives the
death penalty; juries are being discriminating, not dis­
criminatory.

And petitioner is really seeking to have this

Court relit.ig ate what was decided only last year in the
HcGautha issue.
So,

that plea that we consider things on a

constitutional level, without the emotional rhetoric of
political, personal, or moral feelings as to the desirability
of the death penalty, we would submit .that the judgment should
be affirmed in this case, and that the death penalty is
clearly not cruel and unusual punishment.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Thank you, Mr. George,
Thank you, Mr. Amsterdam.
The case is submitted.
