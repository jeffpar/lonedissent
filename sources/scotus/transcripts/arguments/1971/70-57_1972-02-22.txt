HR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 70-57, United States against Caldwell.
Mr, So1icitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN S. GRISWOLD, ESQ-,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRISWOLD:

May it please the Court:

This case is here on a writ of certiorari to review
a decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The question

raised relates to the obligation of a newspaperman to appear
hafore a grand jury.
The court belew held that he need not even appear.
We. think that decision was wrong, and that it goes- far beyond
anything that can be. found in the words of the First Amendment,
and beyond anything that can fairly or properly be implied from
that provision
The ease arises in this setting:

In November 1969,

David Hilliard, the chief of staff of the Black Panther Party,
stated publicly in a speech, ”We will kill Richard Nixon".
This speech was televised live and rebroadcast over many
stations,
As a result, Hilliard was indicted in December 1969,
charged with making threats against the life of the President
of the United States, contrary to Section 871 of Title 18 of
the United States Code.

4
Tie threat was repeated in three subsequent issues of
the weekly periodical: sailed “The Black '?anther **.

Numerous

public statements of a similar nature were reported as being
made during the same period by members or friends of the Black
Panther Party in various parts of the country»
The respondent in this case, Mr, Caldwell, is a
newspaperman employed by the New York Times.

He wrote a series

of articles about the Black Panther Party, three of which appea3
in the printed record.
One of these was published in the New York Times on
December 14th, 1969.

It appears in full at pages 11 to 16 of

the Appendix*
In this article the respondent reported on a
conversation he had with Hilliard and others at the Panther's
headquarters in Berkeley, California.

He quoted Hilliard as

making the following statement, and this appears on page 13 of
the records
"We are special," Mr. Hilliard said recently, "We
advocate the very direct overthrow of the Government by way of
force and violence.

By picking up guns and moving against it

because we recognise it as being oppressive and in recognizing
that we know that the only solution to it is armed struggle."
And then Mr. Caldwell went on to say, in the article:
"In their role as the vanguard in a revolutionary struggle,
the Panthers have picked up guns."

Scm® weeks after the publication of this article the
first subpoena was issu-vd to Mr. Caldwell? on January 30th.
1970«

This was a subpoena duces tecum, it. appears on page 20

of the Appendix, but it was not pressed and it is not now
involved in this case*
The second subpoena was issued on March 13, 1970«.
Xt appears on page 21 of the Appendix.

St is a subpoena to

testify only.
Most of the proceedings in the District Court were
taken with respect to it.
subpoena was returnable

But the grand jury? to which that
expired early in May 1970.

A new

grand jury was empaneled and a new subpoena? the third sub™
jxsena? was served on May 22nd? 1970.

It's that subpoena which

is involved here.
The decision of the District Court related to it? but
by order of the District Court, the proceedings relating to
the earlier 'subpoena were incorporated into these proceedings?
and therefore we refer to one or the other interchangeably,
A motion was filed to quash the May 22nd subpoena.
It appears on pages.98 and 99 of the Appendix.

Xt states:

“The grounds of this motion are identical to the
grounds of movants* Motion to Quash Grand Jury Subpoenas filed
March 17, 1970.'"
And it was with respect to the earlier motion to
quash that Mr. Amsterdam stated? and this is on page 36 of the

6
Appendix, right in the middle of the pages

"The essential clais

of the motion to quash is that Mr, Caldwell's vary appearance
before the grand jury, under the broad terms of these sub­
poenas , will irreparably breach and damage associations and
means of freedom of speech and of the press protected by the
First Amendment.“
The District Court, Jpdgs ZirpoXi, in the Northern
District of California denied the motion to quash and directed
the respondent to appear, but subject to very specific condi­
tions ,
How, the District Court's order of April 7th, which
was where he made the determination, appears at pages 94 to 97
of the Appendix, and the corresponding order of June 4th
appears at pages 104 and 5 of the Appendix,
The relevant portion of the order actually involved
is on page 105, and it reads as follows s
"It is hereby ordered;
"That Earl Caldwell is directed to appear before the
grand jury pursuant to the subpoena of May 22, 1970, and in
so doing he shall not be required to reveal confidential
associations, sources or information received, developed or
maintained by him as a professional journalist in the course
of his efforts to gather news for dissemination to the public
through the press or other news media,
”(2)

That specifically, without limiting paragraph

Cl) , Mr. Caldwell shall not b® required to answer questions
concerning statements made to him or information given to him
by members of the Black Panther Party unless such statements
or information were given to him for publication or public
disclosure;
”(3)

That, to assure the effectuation of this order,

Mr. Caldwell shall be permitted to consult with his counsel at
any time ha wishes during the. course of his appearance before
the grand jury.41
Thus, the issue here is an exceedingly narrow one.
The respondent has been granted protection against revealing
confidential sources and confidential statements.

The

government did not appeal from that part of Judge SSirpoli's
orderr and this was partly because we did not think that it was
appealable.
It is clear, however, that these limitations are in
no 'way at issue here*

The only issue here is that expressed

in Mr. Amsterdam's words in the sbow-cause hearing before Judge
Zirpoli, when he said — and this appears on page 108 of the
Appendix, in the transcript of the hearing before Judge
Sirpoli? just below the middle of the page — "The only cause
which we have to show is that Mr. Caldwell has a constitutional
right not to appear before the grand jury,**
The Court of Appeals below sustained this contention
in

i■

entirety, and held that the respondent need not even

appear fee for 3 the grand jury# despite the broad protection
which has been afforded to him by the District Court's order.
Q

Well, in a way# is it despite or is it in view

of the broad protection that's been accorded already?
Since he's been given so much protection# and since
that's not bean appealed from and is not in issue here, then
isn't the question that it may be the issue that in view of
this broad protection what possible purpose would his appearance
before the grand jury fulfill?
MR. GRISWOLDs

I think that that is perhaps an

appropriate interpretation of the decision of the Court of
Appeals# and it is exemplified afc page 125# in the opinion of
the Court of Appealss
"Appellant asserted in affidavit that there is
nothing to which he could testify {beyond that which he has
already made public and for which# therefore# his appearance
is unnecessary)" — and I question whether his appearance is
unnecessary? just because

it appears in an article, there’s

some difference between testimony under oath and a newspaper
article — "that is not protected by the District Court's
order.s:
This is a rather definitive and positive statement#
but I think its basis in the record is then and attenuated.
Q

But the whole paragraph# though# goes to that

point, does it not?

9
MR. GRISWOLD;

Yes , but this particular statement

on the affidavit of Sari Caldwell, which appears
at pages 1? to 19 of the Appendix. This is an affidavit
intended to 5© self“serving and without any exegesis, and of
course without cross-examination? and the only passage in the
affidavit which bears any relation to this is on page 18 of
the Appendix, about two inches above the bottom of the page,
where Mr. Caldwell said:
"Generally” — and "generally" certainly leaves quite
a lot of room for discussion — “Generally, those matters which
were made on a nonconfidential or *for publication' basis have
been published in articles X have written in The New York Times
conversely, any matters which I have not thus far disclosed in
published articles would have been given to me based on the
understanding that they were confidential and would not be
published.w
Well, in the first place, what that word "generally”
covers, what the exceptions may be because obviously when you
say "generally" you recognize that there are exceptions, does
not in any way appear and is surely a legitimate subject of
inquiry.

But there are other aspects of the matter.

Mr.

Hilliard was quoted in the article written by the respondent„
That certainly is no longer confidential.
circumstances in which it was said?

What were the

Was it after an evening of

drinks, when people were talking pretty freely and loosely?

10
Was it puffing or boasting as a means of attracting attention?
Could it have been said in jest?
The government and tie grand jury are as ranch
interested in establishing the innocence of Mr, Hilliard as
V

in getting a further indictment against him.
This does not begin to cover the field of questions
which

an experienced examiner could direct to the respondent,,

within the limitations imposed by the District Court.

But it

is sufficient - it seems to me, to show that this key statement
in the opinion off the court below has no adequate foundation
in the record.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, what about — what8s this

Court of Appeals referring to in that next sentence?

I'm

looking at 123,
"If this is true — and the Government apparently has
not believed it necessary to dispute it".

That's the next

sentence after what you read.
MR. GRISWOLD:

I don’t know what is meant by the

"Government apparently has not believed it necessary to dispute
it", because it has —
Q

You're certainly disputing it now.

MR. GRISWOLD:
way along.

—- disputed it consistently,, all the

St disputed in counter-affidavits before Judge

Sirpoli; it disputed it in the Court off Appeals? and it is
trying to dispute it here.

Q

Well, it certainly suggests that the Court of

Appeals thought that the Government agreed with it, the
appellant's assertion in the first sentence, doesn’t it?
,MR„ GRISWOLD; Well, if the Court of Appeals believed
that, it was against every effort made to disabuse it, if such
a belief.
The government has accepted the restriction, as I
believe it had to? I don't think it had any choice.
Conceivably, ws could have sought mandamus, to compel the judg
to remove this restriction.

That would have involved long

delays, which, at that time, we were anxious to avoid, and we
did not foresee the long delays which have occurred.
However, we thought that the Court of Appeals would
decide the case the other way, and we could get on with the
inquiry.

We felt that the order, that the limitation was not

appealable, and that in our judgment and discretion it was not
wise to seek review of it by mandamus? but it by no means
follows that we accepted it, thought it was correct, thought
that it was warranted, or, indeed, that it completely fore­
closed: any possible inquiry of Mr. Caldwell before the grand
jury.
I believe that the decision of the Court of Appeals
that he need not even appear is unprecedented.

X know of no

other decision that has held that a newsman or any other
person need hot appear before a grand jury.

I had supposed that everyone in the country, except
the President of- the United States, was amenable to subpoena
before a grand jury subject only to the privilege agaihst
self-incrimination after he got there, and to the control of
the court as to specific questions that might be put to him.
such control being exercised after he appeared and it was known
what those questions were, and the reasons why he felt that he
should not' ba required to answer them.
Q

Where does the exception to the President of

the United States come from?
MR. GRISWOLDz

In separation of powers, I suppose,

by historical derivation from the King.

Simply a matter of

common constitutional law.

Q

Well, what if the President of the United States

were an eyewitness.a —
MR. GRISWOLDs

MR. GRISWOLDt

And I repeat, I believe that8s what

Livingston and Jefferson decided.

Ifc*s just one of those

historical, mildly anomalous rules which one learns in school,
and which I had supposed was -Q

X guess I didn’t learn it, that’s the reason I

And which probably doesn't hurt anybody very

much.
[Laughter.3
MR. GRISWOLD;

And there was a case following the '

Civil War, if I recall, too, it was somebody against Johnson —
Q

Yes.

MR. GRISWOLD;

South Carolina against Johnson,

could it be, in which it was held that President Johnson was
not amenable to suit.
Though the question actually involved in this case
is a relatively narrow on& there is a constant effort to treat
the case on a broader basis in the numerous briefs which have
been filed? but this Court is celled upon here to decide only
whether a reporter can refuse to appear and testify before a
grand jury about matters eonc@ded.ly nonconfidential in nature,

14
on the ground that his appearance alone would jeopardise
confidential relationships and thereby have a chilling effect
on the freedom of the press guaranteed by the First Amendment.
It3 s clear there3 s no privilege to newspapermen at
common law.

A number of States have adopted statutes granting

the privilege tc newspaper reporters, but there's never been a
Federal statute to this effect, and bills which would grant it
have never come out of committee.
Thus, the respondent’s position must rest exclusively
on constitutional grounds, namely, that the First Amendment
protects not only the right to print and publish, without
abridgement, but also provides a constitutionally protected
right to have a wholly unconstrained road in gathering the
news.

There is no foundation for this in the language of the

First Amendment, surely, in its historical background, or in
prior decisions cf thin Court.
Nevertheless, whatever this' Court may do about a
reporter's privilege generally, it should not justify his
refusal even to appear before a grand jury to testify only to
matters concededly nonconfidential in nature.
Most of the material in this record, consisting
largely of affidavits prepared by well-known newsmen, is not
relevant to this issue, since, with few exceptions, they deal
with the questions of confidential sources and confidential
material.

They were filed before Judge Sirpoli's opinion.

15
Nevertheless, the position that the reporter need
not even appear to answer questions with respect to noncon£iden~
tial material is argued vigorously, one might even say
extravagantly.

Thus«• counsel for the respondent, in his brief,

says;
"To an extent never previously shown, this record
documents the devastating effect that the compulsion of news­
men's testimony has upon freedom of the press»” '
Yet, as I have indicated,with only one exception
the items railed on deal with confidential sources and
confidential material, which are not involved here? and they
are based solely on affidavits from newsmen which are, in
their nature, self“serving, never subject to cross-examination.
These affidavits do show that there is a reaching
out among journalists for a reporter's source privilege.

But

suc7.li © desire among newsmen has heretofore fallen short of
establishing a constitutional right.
Since the briefs ware filed in this case, we have
a new source of information about this.

I'm not sure just what

its status is, but there has been made available within the
past two weeks a study report of the Reporters * Committee on
Freedom of the Press.

This seems to be e® ad hoc group, of

which Mr. Fred P. Graham of the Now York Times is listed as
coordinator.

And the work was done by a Professor Vince

Blasie of the University of Michigan Law School.

16
It's clearly a thoughtful, thorough,, and reasonably
objective report, subject to the comment that the information
summarized was obtained only from reporters and others
connected with the communications media.
In addition, a portion of the report has just been
published in the article in the Michigan Law Review for
December 1971.

This is the newsmen' s privilege and empirical

study in 670 Michigan Law Review 229.

Perhaps it's just my

academic background that makes me regret that Professor Blazie
does not disclose in his Michigan article that his study was
in fact commissioned by the Reporters* Committee.
As 1 have indicated, though, within the plan that
he has adopted, he appears to have done a careful and thought­
ful job, and the Court may find some useful materials in the
study or in the article.
One thing that does appear, 1 think, is that
reporters generally are much less intense about this than is
the respondent's brief.

Professor Blasie says, for example,

that the average newsman in the population surveyed relies on
regular confidential sources in 22.2 percent of his stories,
and on first-time confidential sources in 12.2 percent of his
stories.
Another item of possible interest appears.
his respondents:

He asked

in the last 13 months has your coverage of

any story been adversely .affected by the possibility that you

17
might be subpoenaed?
Of the 887 newsmen who answered this question,. 8 per­
cent said yes, 1.0„9 percent said "I’m not sure", and 81.1
percent of them said no.
,

And again in the respondent's brief in this case a

reporter, Anthony Ripley, is referred to and the statement is
made that, quote:

"Anthony Ripley was destroyed by being

subjected to a subpoena."
That's on page 75 of the Respondent's brief.
But Professor Blassie says in his report., these
incidents were personally very upsetting to Ripley, but they
did not significantly interfere with his reporfcincr career: he
subsequently was able to do a superb investigative story on
the shoot-out in Cleveland.

Anthony Ripley's case is thus not

as it is sometimes cited to be, referring to the brief in this
case, an example of a subpoena causing an intolerable inter­
ference with news flow.
If there were a reporter's privilege not even to appear
before a grand jury, found by this Court for the first time
somewhere in the penumbra of the First .Amendment, for it's
surely not within its terms, how far is it to extend?

To

whom is it to be made available?
Surely it could not be limited to what might be
called the established press, like the New York Times, nor can
it be limited to daily newspapers or to newspapers; you would

18

have to apply it to radio and television reporting, it would
also have to apply to the foreign language press, the under­
ground press, the college press; it would have to apply to
magazines and surely to pamphleteers.

What about people who

write books?
And there are beginning to be assertions that there
is an academic privilege, a privilege by academic persons not
to testify about activities in which they have been engaged,
which bear some relation to their fields of interest and
scholarship»
If a privilege not even to appear before a grand
jury is established on the part of the established press, I
find it difficult to see where the limit can fairly be drawn
with respect to anyone who publishes in any form or speaks,
whether in the classroom or on the platform or on the street
corner or in Union Square.

There may be safeguards which are

appropriate in particular cases.

This is not an issue in this

case.
But to hold that any person has the privilege not
even to appear before a grand jury, without a single question
being asked, goes beyond anything that has yet been decided
and seems to us to go too far.
The grand jury should not, in this case any more than
in other cases, be required to predetermine and disclose the
scope of its investigation as a condition to calling before it

a reporter who has undertaken to make public many statements,
including allegedly direct quotations from a number of people.
The press plays a great role
rightly so,

in this country, and

It has almost unlimited freedom to print what it

pleases, without prior restraint, as this Court’s decision
last June in New York Times against the United States shows.
But as I read the opinions in that case, though a
majority of the Court opposed prior restraint on the facts of
that case, there was also a majority of the Court that seemed
to say that the press can be held responsible through criminal
sanctions when they are applicable for what it does decide to
print.
Surely, such possible criminal sanctions or civil
liabilities for malicious libel, which, as far as I know, has
never been barred, malicious libel, must have a chilling effect
on the press, to utilize that over-used phrase.
What this means is that the press, though having
great freedom to print, likewise has many responsibilities of
citizenship.

Just as the press is responsible and can be held

responsible for its actions, reporters are citizens and retain
the responsibilities of citizenship, at the very least?

whereas
i

here protection has been given against disclosing confidential
sources or confidential information, there is no basis for
giving & privilege not even to appear before a grand jury.
Since the court below'in effect established such a

20
privilege, its judgment should be reversed»
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERt

Thank you, Mr. Solicitor

General.
Mr, Amsterdam»
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. AMSTERDAM;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
If constitutional adjudication were a process of
picking the general legal doctrine that fitted a case most
closely and applying it mechanically to resolve a specific
controversy, then the present case would involve an intractably
difficult problem.
The government stands on a categorical imperative
that the grand jury is entitled to every man’s evidence.

We

would, 1 suppose, have to stand on a categorical imperative of
equal abstraction on the other side, that government may not
abridge the freedom of the press, and the Court would have to
pick between the two.
Of course that is not the issue, that is not our
position? but it is the government's position which stands, 1
think, rather woodenly on the proposition that whatever pro­
tection the First Amendment may give against specific questioning
by a grand jury, the obligation of a witness to appear before
the grand jury is so absolute, saving only perhaps the President

21
of the United States, that no situation, no conflict with any
other right, however its strength, can qualify the grand jury's
right to have every witness appear before it.
Q

This position —

I suppose the appearance would give the

opportunity to, or the chance that the witness might change his
mind or break down or be sweated out of his former position?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Well, that is certainly one of the

dangers involved in his appearance, and one of the reasons why
we think his nonappearance, in the particular and very narrow
circumstances of this case, is not required.
We think the government’s position —
0

What happens on Fifth Amendment cases?

On Fifth Amendment case::.; you have to go, don’t you?
MR. AMSTERDAMs

Yes, but the Fifth Amendment

privilege, Mr. Justice Marshall, is based on quite a different
footing.

The Fifth Amendment privilege is based on the notion

that the evidence that one gives may result in harm by
incrimination.

Nothing that underlies the Fifth Amendment

depends on the effect of testimony upon one’s relations with
other people.
Q

Well, the harm might be much greater in the case

of the Fifth Amendment situation than in the First, might it
not?

He might go to jail for 20 or 30 years.
MR. AMSTERDAM;

I cannot conceive of any way in which

his appearance before the grand jury would incur

much harm

22
under the Fifth Amendment, let alone more than in this case, to
the First*

The —
0

Well, what if the circumstances were such that

he were part of the — or at least close enough to some
organised and rather desperate criminal group, that he might
get shot on his way to the grand jury, as soon as it became
known. Would you think that would afford an excuse for going?
MR. AMSTERDAM?
question.

No ■— perhaps 1 misunderstand the

1 have no doubt that no one may be exempted from an

appearance before a grand jury, nor indeed from answering
questions, simply because of considerations for personal safety.
But in terras of Mr. Justice Marshall’s question as to why one
may compel a witness to appear in front of the grand jury,
without prejudice to the Fifth, and I think Your Honor1s
question with regard to what prejudice to the Fifth would be
incurred; there is no prejudice to the Fifth.
When a question is asked, he claims it.

If the

government then overbears him in any way, as Mr. Justice
Douglas suggested, and the evidence is sought to be used against,
him, we have, of course, self-incrimination in violation o£ the
Constitution, and it simply can’t be used.
The Fifth Amendment, in short, is protectable by
the process of having him respond to particular questions.
The First Amendment privilege, which 1 hope to develop on the
basis of the record here, rests on a very different footing

altogether

It rests on the impact of the interrogative

process on relations between the reporter and his sources f
which are not protected in the way that the Fifth Amendment
could adequately be protected before the grand jury.
The position, then, that ~~
Q

Well, that doesn81 reach the point I was trying

to flush out, Mr. Amsterdam,

Suppose a man had witnessed a

gang slaying, to make it more concrete, and he is at least
thought by the police to have been a witness, although they're
not sure, and they serve a subpoena on him in the usual course,
and he goes into the District Court and says:

If I go to

that grand jury, my friends will never believe that I didn't
tell something, and I'll be shot.
Now, you have just said that considerations of
personal safety would never be an excuse for staying away.
MR. AMSTERDAMs
Q

That's correct, Your Honor. And —«

But considerations of being able to gather news

at some future date should be an excuse?
MR. AMSTERDAM:
Q

Yes, Your Honor, I —

That's more important then his life, the

reporter's life?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Nothing is more important than life,

but one doesn't reason backward from the fact that deprivation
■?. invg",

other rights can't be taken

away by a process which jeopardises specific constitutional

24
guarantees.

Punishment in this case, we think, is, as the

government has stated, whether or not Mr. Caldwell is required
to appear.
I would answer Your Honor's question as to whether a
witness was required to answer any specific question in the
same way in which X answered the question whether he's obliged
to appear.

Pear for the safety of life would be no defense

to refusal to answer a specific question.

Fear for the safety

of life would be no excuse for not appearing at all.
The government is drawing a distinction between
appearing and answering specific questions.

Surely, that

distinction draws no sustenance from the fact that a grand jury
witness is not permitted to refuse to appear because his life
may be in jeopardy.

He’s also not permitted to refuse to

answer questions because his life may be in jeopardy.
That is, X think, a totally different issue from the
issue here.

Where it’s not the witness's right primarily that

is at stake at all, but what is primarily involved is the
impact of the process of subpoenaing witnesses who are news­
men, with the inevitable effect on the editorial decisions
which are made — which 1*11 come back to — and also the
process of gathering news upon the free flow of information to
the public.
That, 1 think, poses a totally different problem
than any question of personal safety of any one particular

25
witness.
The government states the grand jury8s right to the
testimony of every man in terms which I think bring to mind
Justice Holmes’ famous aphorism, that every right tends to
declare itself absolute to its logical extreme? followed, of
course, by the observation that in fact every right is not
absolute to its logical extreme, but is limited by the neighbor­
hood of other principles» which corns to hold water, to hold
their own against that right when a certain point is reached.
The question in this case, very simply, is whether
the point has been reached at which the general right, which
we do not contest at all, of a grand jury to have the testimony
of every man, to have every man appear, is to be accommodated
at all to concerns for the First Amendment.
•

<

We take a very different view from the government.
We don’t stand on the proposition that nothing that the grand
jury does which affects the First Amendment may be permitted?
we don’t take the position that the 'first Amendment is an end
to the grand jury.

What we think is involved is the accommoda­

tion of two very, very important concerns.
The grand jury's investigative process on the one
hand, and the reporter5s investigative process on the other.
And we think that the Court of Appeals properly,
again on the narrow facte of this case, struck the balance
between those two, by saying that, although ordinarily any

26
witness must appear before a grand jury, that in the case of
reporters* on the showing made on this record, the government
may compel appearance only by making a foundation showing,
which it has never made or attempted to make in this case*
Now, the government has presented this case in this
Court, both in its brief and in the argument, by taking really
two positions? but the one it most stands on is that even if
Mr. Caldwell has a right as a journalist, protected by the
First Amendment, not to answer specific questions,

that

nevertheless he must appear.
Then the government appears to take the position,
although it was not argued separately this morning in detail,
that in fact the journalist doesn't even have any protection
against specific questions.
Mow, it’s that way of phrasing the matter that kind of
requires me to argue my case backwards.

I would like to start

logically by demonstrating that, as the Court of Appeals
found, and through the processes by which it found it, that a
reporter does have some consltufcional protection, that there

is some First Amendment interest implicated in the subpoena™
compelled testimony of newsmen, and that that First Amendment
i*

interest requires some accommodation with the grand jury
process.

And then I would like to proceed to discover what

accommodation is required in this case.
But since my argument time is limited, and there are

21
two other eases that foil mi this one that will deal primarily
with the question of whether the reporter has any First
Amendment protection at all, I think I’d like to start with the
same position that the government took in this ease and assume
the validity of Judge Sirpoli’ s order, and ask whether„ if
Judge SirpoliSs order is proper and if this Court would affirm
it, Mr. Caldwell should he entirely excused from appearing.
Then, in what time I have left after that, I can come
back, if I can, and deal with the question of the propriety of
the order.
Now, in dealing with that question, 1 think it is very
important to follow the course of litigation in this case.. and
the positions that the parties have takers in it.
The litigation began by the service of a subpoena on
Mr, Caldwell

it had a duces tecum rider that made it very

clear that he was to be questioned about the Black Panthers.
Mr., Caldwell filed an affidavit in support of a motion
to quash that subpoena, which recited that, among other things,
he had no unpublished, nonconfidential information about the

•

Black Panthers.
7s

11 read the specific terms of that affidavit in one

second r but the first thing I want to point out is that this
affidavit was not filed at a latterly stage of this proceeding
in an att empt to write himself into the protection of the
district j udge8 s order*

This was filed at the very beginning,

28
before anybody had the faintest idea what the district judge5s
order was going to be»
And Mr. Caldwell. — the reason for the word "generally
at the beginning, I should note, of the quotation I’m going to
read*, which Dean Griswold has focused on, is to explain the
immediately preceding sentences in which Mr. Caldwell makes
clear that the way the Panthers function with the press doesn't
involve an

©n-the-roeord/of£•-the-record type of a thing, it4s

an understanding of what is confidential and what is not.
It is in that context that he says "generally, those
matters which were made on a nonconfidential or 8 for publica™
tion* basis have been published in articles I have written in
The Hew York Times."
Now we get to the converse proposition, which is the
important one, and which is qualified by no "generally”:
“Conversely, any matters which I have not thus far disclosed
in published articles would have been given to me based on
the understanding that they were confidential and. would not be
published."
He5:3 asserting quite categorically that he does not
have unpublished nonconfidential material about the Black
Panthers.
How, the government put in numerous affidavits, made
no contest on this point whatsoever.

The District Court came

down with an order granting Mr. Caldwell a protection against

29
specific questioning, but. requiring him to go before the grand
jury.
During the course of proceedings under that one, that
grand jury aspired? a new subpoena was issued? the government
again had a full-blown chance to contest factually the
proposition on which the Court of Appeals later was to make its
finding that Mr, Caldwell had no unpublished nonconfidential
information to give the grand jury.

And the government made no

such showing.
0

Hr. Amsterdam, isn't the place where the

government ordinarily contests that is before the grand jury
itself?

That is, the government may not know what Caldwell

will be able to testify to, and customarily it brings him
before a grand jury to find out what his testimony would be,
MR, AMSTERDAMt

X have no doubt that if there were no

reason to give him protection against appearing before the grand
jury, that a perfectly proper place to explore that question
would be before the grand jury. But where the claim is made,
as it was in this case, that there are serious constitutional
implications, harms to the First Amendment, of his very appear­
ance, then the

;ourt may properly inquire, I believe, whether

there is anything that the government could get out of him
if he went in front of the grand jury»
<2

Isn't the government at a built-in disadvantage

in that sort of a proceeding, in that the witness, such as Mr.

30
Caldwell here, will have his version of what the government
could get. out of him, supplied by affidavit, and the government
not having had the advantage of examining, very likely he
simply doesn't know what it may get out of him?
MR. AMSTERDAMs Well, that is precisely, we think, the
implication of this Court * s decisions, for example, in the
legislative investigation areas

that although government is at

a disadvantage in starting investigations, it may not start
them in a way that has the drastic effect on the First
Amendment, simply on speculation.
X agree that in many cases it may be difficult for
the government to know what a reporter knows.

But, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, the government subpoenaed this man for a reason,
1 suppose? we think it's based in part on electronic eaves-’
dropping, but* the government says it subpoenaed him on the
basis of his stories.
Now, if there were any evidence in the stories that
*

he had nonconfidenfcial unpublished information, or if the
government would provide other information that we think it has
about Mr. Caldwell's communications with the Panthers, there
would be no difficulty at all in establishing what the
government thinks that Mr. Caldwell knows.
The government hasn't even suggested, in this case,
anything that may be nonconfidential that Mr. Caldwell has.
There are many ways in which the government could go about

making such a showings

fcfcs face of his waitings? anything

that, he held said outside of his writings, that the government

may have overheard, in terns ox his communications with the
Panthers„ something very much in issue in the background of
this case.
Q

Well, what about — MR. Amsterdam,, what about

calling him to get him to put on the record what he has written
in his stories?
The nonconfidential information that a grand jury may
well want to hear in order to — as a — to get it in forum
form,, and in order to get its own reaction to it?
SR. AMSTERDAMz

Mr. Justice Whits, I cannot deny and

do not deny that it would be admissible evidence before a
grand" jury to have Mr. Caldwell come in and authenticate his
story.

I don't deny that.
Her do I assart that what he published was confiden­

tial? his publication of it makes it very clear that it was not
confidential*
Wh&t X do assert, and what I think the Court of
Appeals very plainly believed, was that there are certain
increments to investigation which are so da minimis, so marginal,
ao totally insignificant that any significant First Amendment
harm on the other side plainly outweighs them; in the same way
in which the State cannot, even though it has an interest in
prohibiting street littering, it cannot forbid the giving out

32
of handbills.
Hemf let’s look for a moment at what Mr. Caldwell's

authentication of this article would tell the grand jury.
Q

Before you get to that, let me ask you this,

because it may relate to it.

Suppore the articles that were

actually published showed concrete evidence of indictable
offenses, So you think that the grand jury could just put those
articles in the record of the grand jury and then indict on
that basis, or do you think that they ought to have the duty
to call him end make the same statements under oath?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

Well, Your Honor, do 1 think that the

grand jury could or properly should subpoena a reporter?
Q

Yes.

MR. AMSTERDAM:

I think that if the reporter’s

statement describes the elements of indictable offenses, that
the authentication of the story would, in many but not all
cases, provide valuable information for the grand jury.
Mow, one of the tests we propose as a foundation for
calling a report before the grand jury is that that information
not ba available through ©there means that are less disruptive
of First Amendment interests? and so I’m not answering Your
Honor's question, suggesting that that witness, I think, could
always be called.
But X will say it would be a totally different case
than this case.

Because here what we have is authentication,

33
if anything, of a proposition that David Hilliard said that
the Black Panthers were a revolutionary group, and that this
was- serious,
Mr. Justice White, what that would add to the grand
jury's information is charily described as zero.
Q

Well, what are you pushing?

That any time,

any time a court would decide that he doesn't have — that his
authenticating his published story would not contribute much,
you can't call him? but in a lot of other circumstances you
could.

Is that your suggested rule?
MR,, AMSTERDAM:

Mr. Justice White, that's in our

approach very basically is that it's that kind of accommodating
judgment is what the standoff, if you will, of the grand jury
institution, embodied in. the Fifth Amendment and the First
Amendment, calls for.
Q

Mr. Amsterdam, is there any other group that can

tell a grand jury, i3l can't be subpoenaed"?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

I’m sorry, Mr. Justice Marshall? is

there any other —?

Q

Group of people in the United States who, when

they get a. grand jury subpoena, can say "I won’t go.”
MR. AMSTERDAM: Well, yes, Your Honor, there are a
umber of people.
q

"mo?

MR, AMSTERDAM:

Well, one case is, for example, the

34
Window Glass Workers case# which is cited in our brief.
it*s not a matter of a group.
0

That

If an individual —

But you5 re talking about a group.

You said

anybody who has the word “reporter" in his vocabulary is it.
Or do you draw a line?
HR. AMSTERDAM?

I would suppose that there were

constitutional rules# and I think that the First Amendment
might to© one of them# which might very well preclude other
people from being called before the grand jury than reporters.
1 think that# for example# if the grand jury called before it
individuals who were members of the NAACP in Little Rock# that
in particular circumstances# with a particular balancing test#
this Court might very well find that the very appearance of
those people before the grand jury was so distractive of
First Amendment interests that they could not be called.
Q

Wall# I'm speaking about 972.

In California#

what group is there that has this privilege of not even going#
I mean a lawyer can go to the grand jury and say what you want
from me would violate the lawyer-client privilege# and I won't
tell you.

A doctor can say# and they have their privileges,

clearly established.
MR. AMSTERDAM:
Q

Well —

But they go and raise that privilege.

But

your — as I understand your point# they don't even have to go
to the grand jury.

35
MR. AMSTERDAM*

Well, let me — to start with,- that

is not nacesnai'ily my point? that is not the basis —
Q

3ut thatfs what: yon said.

MR. AMSTERDAM:
Court of Appeals

It is not the basis oh which the

decision rests.

My point is that if the

defendant, if the grand jury witness is so completely protected
by the protective order that he needs answer no questions
which could be of any use to the government„ that it would be
a futile exercise to make him appear, and that that would
violate the First Amendment if the fact of his appearance would
have a significant —
Q

Well, may 1 ask, Mr. Amsterdam -- let's take

this very protective order, but an article which has been
published in the Maw York Times attributing to someone an
omission that he had committed a murder.

In that circumstance,

with this very protective order, would that be a situation in
which he would have to appear, where the balance would be that
he must appear?
MR. AMSTERDAMj

1 think, with one qualification again,

Your Honor, that I think the government should have to show
also unavailability of equal information from another source.
But if we put that one aside? and I bn willing to put it aside
because I don*t need to reach it for the purposes of this case,
then I would say that the government could call him.
Q

1*011, then, all you * re asking is, as I under-

stand it, a principle which requires the balance and which
balance made in, this case opts in favor of affirmance of the
Court of Appeals?
MR. AMSTERDAM:
Q

Precisely.

That ' a all there is to it;?

MR. AMSTERDAM;
this is very important.

Precisely.

Now, Your Honor, I' think

Mr. Justice Marshall, the court below

took this thing in two bites, and I'd like to take it in two
bites if X can*
Bite one is the question whether or not this witness
was entitled to soma kind of protection against open-ended
questioning before the grand jury, which might intrude on
First Amendment relations.
Now, we argue that his open-ended appearance before the
grand jury would have a devastating effect on the free flow
of information that’s central to the First Amendment.
Q

Well, let's get to this point;

Wouldn't it

be — you wouldn't raise the question, as I understand, that
part of the opinion of the Court of Appeals said the government
has a responsibility for showing what they need you for.
Is that right?
MR. AMSTERDAM s
case, that’s correct*
Q

Served upon the narrow facts in this

No question.

But let me —•

Well, what would happen, for example, if Mr.

Caldwell was talking to members of the high-faluting fly people,

3?
confidentially# et ceteraf and he gets subpoenaed, and he says:
"I don’t have to come; because whatever I heard was confidentialv'
and the government says..

"Yes, but while you were there they

brought out two dead bodies” —
HR. AMSTERDAM;

That would meet the government's

burden»
Q

And you’d have no problem with it?

MR. AMSTERDAM:

No problem.

And the Court of Appeals

decision leaves that open# and the thing that has been, I think#
totally ignored in the government's argument in this Court is
that that is open.
Not only has the government, at every opportunity
below# failed to claim that there were any dead bodies lurking
around here# or any non confidential information? but the*
Court of Appeals sort of leaves it to the government to show
that on .remand.

The Court of Appeals'only holding in this

case is# it’s a very narrow one, and this appears on page 125?
it says that;
i

"If any competing public interest is ever to arise
in a case such as this" — that is any competing belief or the
testimony of a witness

"where First Amendment liberties are

threatened by the mere appearance at a grand jury investiga­
tion# it will be cn an occasion in which the witness# armed
with his privilege# can still serve a useful purpose before
the grand jury.

Considering the scope of the privilege

38
embodied in the protective order, these occasions would seem
to be unusual.

It is not asking too much of the government

to show that such an occasion is presented here.8’
‘M-

stand on that and think this Court plainly ought

to affirm this, because it's plainly raised.
Q

Well? then, in any event, you are not asking

or suggesting that the First Amendment in this area requires
a prophylactic rule, are you?
MR» AMSTERDAM:
Q

Absolutely not.

That the reporter need, not even appear.

ME. AMSTERDAM:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

We

are seeking to sustain this decision on the ground below that
the witness had a privilege, embodied in Judge Zlrpoli's order,
which would in fact have so totally deprived his appearance
of meaning that, the residual harm which would have been done
to First Amendment right far outweighed the residual benefit
that would have been done to the grand jury's investigative
process.
Now, ■—
Q

Is it possible that the Court of Appeals had

no factual basis on which to reach that conclusion?
MR. AMSTERDAM:

It is not possible that they had

no factual basis on which to reach it, and they —
Q

Well, I suppose you would be saying that it

would not be possible for us to make that conclusion on this

39
record's

MR# AMSTERDAMs

Mo„

I think, first of all. with due

deference to fcba Court of Appeals * conclusion » which stated
not only that it reached if on the basis of the record, but
that the government had not contested it, would not permit this
Court to upset the ruling,, but, besides» I think it would be
inappropriate for the Court to upset it,,

Because the Court

of Appeals5 judgment allows the matter to be litigated by the
government in District Court, where it can be far better
litigated than by inferences such as what the word '"generally*
means on a cold record in this Court,
Wow, my time is so close to running, that I would
just like to spend a minute or two more on why 1 think the
residual ham of mere appearance in this case does outweigh
the residual benefit of mere, for example, authentication of
the article,
The government is wrong in its assertion that only
one, I think it said here, two in the brief, of the reporters
below claiming that mere appearance would have a devastating
effect on First Amendment rights.
In fact, there ere six reporters who said this, the
pages in the record cite it on page 33 of our brief in the
footnote will give the Court those page references,
The government has also made some reference to
Professor Blasie's study.

Thera are several things that ought

to be said about Professor Blazie’s study, not the least of
which appears on page 69 of it, nothing in the opinion of every
reporter with whom I discussed the matter would be more
damaging to source relationships than a Supreme Court
reversal of the Minth Circuit Caldwell holding.
Several newsman told me that initially they were
extremely worried by the subpoena scare of two years ago, but
that now their anxieties have greatly subsided as a result of
the strong stand taken by the journalism profession and its
victories in court»

*

However, a Supreme Court declaration that the First
Amendment is in no wise abridged by the practice of subpoenaing
reporters would, these newsmen assert, set off a wave of
anxiety among sources,

Q

What are you reading from?

ME. AMSTERDAMs

It is their opinion, that a Supreme

Court holding would —
Q

Mr. Amsterdam, I have the Michigan Law Review

version of it.
Q

Mo, he's got the big thing.

Q

Have you got the — what page?

MR. AMSTERDAM*

I have the full-scale study, and

I believe that these are available, Your Honor,,

Q

1 have that in my office.

you had a cross page reference to this?

X just wondered if

41
MR. AMSTERDAMs

Page 69, in the footnote — the foot­

notes are the same, it would be at footnote 215 and in that
area.
Q

Thank you.

MR. AMSTERDAM s The next point that X want to make
about the Blazie Study, I think demonstrates the importance of
not litigating the fact questions in this Court, but rather
sticking to the record which'X think is very'clear on such
questions as source reliance and chilling effect.
The government has mentioned the fact that 8 percent
of reporters said in the last 18 months that it had not been
affected by the subpoena controversy.

But Blazia's study

nowhere says when the reporters were asked that question and
when they answered.

In fact, the questionnaire went out in

the third week of July 1971, and answers were tabulated until
October 20th of 1971, 18' and one-half months after the Caldwell
decision by the District Court.
The Caldwell decision by the District Court had been
given very wide publicity, as giving newsmen a general
protection if, as Professor Blazie says on page 68 of this
document, it cleared the air.

It's perfectly understandable

that relatively few reporters would have been affected in the
period of the IS months following that decision by the fears,
which it is the very purpose of this litigation to lay to
rest

42
