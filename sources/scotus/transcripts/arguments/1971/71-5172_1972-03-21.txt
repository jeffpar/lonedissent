MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will Hear arguments

next in 71 *5172, Dukes against Warden, Connecticut State
Prison.
Mr. Wade, you mav proceed whenever von are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. WADE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WADE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I was intrigued this morning to hear the comments
of the Court regarding the right to counsel and the need
of counsel in the Wade-Gilbert cases, and X might sav
preliminarily that I am not related to Mr. Wade that this
Court immorta 1 i sed.
This case, I think, the issue raised here focusses
on the ned to have the undivided loyalty of counsel throughout
every stage of criminal cases. If T could recite briefly the
facts herein, because I feel they are verv important to set
the proper framework, my client, Mr. Dukes, was arrested
in Hartford in March of 1967 and charged with a violation of
Connecticut's Uniform Narcotics Law.

>Te retained a Hartford

attorney by the name of Saccagnino of the law firm of
Zaccagnino,

Linardos and Delaney to represent him and

indeed that office netered appearance in the lower court for
preliminary hearing on the arrest and charge.

4
Then on May 9/ 1967 , when the matter was set own
for trial in the Hartford Superior Court, **r. Dukes appeared
with his attorney, Mr, Zaccagnino, and at that time ?/r.
2accagnino moved thathe be permitted to witdrav from the
action as counsel for Dubes, because as he put it to the
court at that time, he had a slight conflict with his
client.

Thatroatter was argued before the trial judge at that

point, and the court denied the motion for Mr. Zaccagnino
to withdraw but continued the case for 24 hours to give
Dukes a chance to get another lawyer.
QUESTION: Mr. Wade,

from your acguaintance with

the record, what is the fairest interpretation of Mr.
Zaccagnino ’ s remark to the trial judge that he had something
of a conflict with his client?
MR. WADE:

My judgment would be that he was tryino

to convince Dukes to plead guilty and that^ukes did not
want to plead guilty, and thattbis was the conflict vis-a-vis
Zaccagnino and Dukes.

I can't say fairly at that, point, Mr.

Zaccagnino was trying to apprise the court there was some other
conflict other than that. That would be my best judgment,
Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
In any case, when Mr. Dukes left the courtroom on
May

.9, he went out in the hallway of the court and was

rearrested by the Hartford Police and taken to the Hartford
Police Station on an unrelated charge.

5
While he was at the police station, he took. some
pills, hecerme side, was taken to a hospital a nr? stayer» there
for a

■■■ '.':]

arse then came hack into court on May 1« with

Mr. Haccagnino to ourt on May IP with Mr. 7accagnino's law
partner, Mr. Delaney, a no at that time entered a plea of
guilty to the narcotics charge and amendment to the informa­
tion charging him with larceny and receiving stolen goods.
At that time, the trial judge made incruirv about
the voluntariness of the plea.

The matter was set down for

June 2 for sentencing, hut on June 2, the pre-sentencing
report was not ready on the Dukes matter, so the case was
continued again.
Mr. 2accagnino was in court with his client,
Mr. Dukas, for sentencing hut it went over another two weeks,
hist on the second, Mr. JSaccagnino appeared before Judge Devlin
of the Hartford Superior Court with two girls whom he was
representing on charges that were entirely unrelated to
Mr. Dukes* charges.

But 1 might say that Mr. Dukes has

a oocalencant in thg saiga .case with the girls and was
represented by another Hartford attorney in that case.
QUESTION:

Was that a narcotics case also?

MR. WADE: No, that was a conspiracy to obtain money
by false premises, your Honor.
So at the time of sentencing of the girls and by the
way, they had pled guilty earlier to the charge, Mr.

Zaccagnino stood tap to make remarks on sentencing on
behalf of the girls.

If X could indulge the court a moment

here, reading from page GH of the appendix, during his
remarks on sentencing, Rr.Saecagnino speaking on behalf
of the girls said that both of them came under the influence
of Charles Dukes.

Now, how they could get into the position

of coming under the influence of somebody like him, if your
Honor please, is the big problem here that I think is the
cause of the whole situation, and in tine last paragraph
there, "as a result of their willingness to cooperate
with the State Police, they capitulated nukes into making
a plea,;! think,ycur Honor,since I was on both sides of
the case, having been on the other side of the other case,
I can tell your Honor it

was

these girls, because of

their refusal, not refusal, not to cooperate with Dukes
and to testify against him that capitulated him into taking
a plea on which he will be shortly removed from society."
On page 70 of the appendix, once again referring
to the girls and their cooperation with the police, Mr.
Zaocagnino said to the court, "It is obvious from looking
at the report who the most culpable person is because he had
all the instruments with which to dupe these girls.”
QUESTIONs Was Hr. Zaccagnino referring to the plea
in the conspiracy case?
hr.

HADE:

No, your Honor

V

?

QUESTION t The narcotics case?
MR, WADE;

That's correct.

Then on June 26,

two weeks later, Mr. Eaccagnino and Dukes were hack before
the same trial judge, Judge Devlin, who had heard these
remarks about the girls.

They were hack in front of him

at that time and at this point, Dukes himself moved the
court that the cpailty plea be vacated and that he wanted to
get another lawyer, and ha did not

want «r» Eaccaemino

to continue to represent him.
Well, the court denied thatmotion and ordered
that the case go forward and thereupon imposed a sentence
of not less than five or more than ten years on Mr. Dukes.
Now, it is our contention that the conduct of
counsel for Dukes at that time was such as to render the
entire proceeding, including the guilty plea, invalid.
It is our contention that ho was denied the effective
assistance of counsel-QUESTION: Could I ask you if in the other proceed
iny where ho was a co-defendant with some girls, bad he
been sentenced in thatproceeding?
MR. WADE: Mo, not at that point, your Honor.
QUESTION: Was ha later?
MR. WADEs

That was later disposed of.

QUESTION: He pleaded guilty in thatproceeding?
MR. WADE: If I am not mistaken, and I think Mr.

8

a

Mr.

can verify this, I believe it was nolle pros sec?
t

at a later date, after the sentencing in this case.
QUESTION; Nolle pressed against him?

I

MR. WADE: Yes, your Honor.

s

QUESTION: Even though he had already pleaded guilty?!

s

ME, WADE: No, he had not pled at that point, you

•7

see .

The girls at that point had- pled guilty but. be had not.
QUESTION: Oh, I see.

9

hr.

WADE: I might also point out there were several

10

charges pending against him, and most of these other matters

II

were consolidated at a later point and the Stated® Attorney

12

can advise you, but X think—

13

QUESTION: The reason for my question was whether

14

any elements of a bargain between the prosecutor and Dukes

15

with respect to these two proceedings—

IS

hr,

WADE: No question at this point. He got the

17

sentence that the state and Mr. 7accagnino had bargained

!8

about.

19
20
21

That is one thing that is pointed out.
QUESTION: And was par^of the bargain that the

other charge be noHe'd?
MR. WADE: That I can ^'answer, your Honor. I was

A.

2Z

not privy to those negotiations.

23

at the time. I simply do not knew.

was not representing him

24

QUESTION:

Was the prosecutor the same prosecutor?

23

MR. WADS:

Yes, Mr. LaBelle was the same prosecutor

9

01

\'/’"OHIs

r',t

reasonable to assume there was

some connection between the two?
HR. w&DE.. i’ll let Mr. LaBelle answer that, **r.
Chief Justice, rather than X.
QUESTIONt

Let’s assume there was—it may be

contrary to fact, but let’s assume there was—then ’there
would Le vary little that Kaecagnino could do to hurt Mr,
Dukes,
MR, WADE:
White,

Well, X bag to differ, Mr. Justice

The first reason X differ is that I don’t think at

this point the law has reached a point where negotiations
between a prosecator and defense counsel are binding on the
court.
QUESTION: Oh, I agree with that, but if Pukes
wasn’t going to get hurt in the ether proceeding anyway,
Zacc&gnino*® remarks at that time didn’t hurt him, did
it?
• /

ME, WADE:

Well, X would refer the court then to

the reasoning of the Pennsylvania Court in Commonwealth v„
Cullen,

That was a situation where the defendant, co-

defendants represented by a single counsel received exactly
the sentence that had been bargained for, but the Pennsyl­
vania Supreme Court reversed, saying in view of the preju­
dicial conflict of Interest, they felt that you had to go
all the

dlt plea and decide was he

10

getting adequate advice at the time he entered the guilty
/

plea.
\.. . .

; >: Did Mr, Zaccagnino have Mr. Dukes*

interests at heart?

Was he giving him proper information?

Indeed with another counsel who was in there independently
of Mr. Zaccagnino, look at the evidence these girls might
be willing to give vis-a-vis Dukes and advise his client
that the evidence was either admissible cr not admissible?
1 think that your Honor has to lock to the fact we’re not .
looking at sentence here? we are going back to the guilty
plea and questioning whether or not at that point he was
denied the effective assistance of his counsel, and we
submit that the on-the-record statement of Mr. Zaccagnino
manifests that conflict of interest that existed. •
r

How this court has not really spoken to this point
since 1942f when the Black decisionwis handed down and that
was a. situation where the defendant himself was an attorney
and there was single counsel representing him and another
co-defendant.

The defendant 6lasser was a former assistant

United States Attorney charged with conspiracy to defraud
the United States Government.

This Court at that point was

very explicit to poird- out that in a criminal proceeding,
rue defendant should have representing him a person whosp
interest are untrammeled by possible conflicts of interest,
and the court laid down a touchstone which the lower

il
courts have all dealt with, as far as X can see, since 1942.

■Z

They laid down as a touchstone to determine whether or not

3

that assistance of counsel was untrammeled, x«w? whether
or not it was as effective as it might have been.

Was the

j

j

\
assistance of counsel as effective as it would have been

i
i

had there not been this conflict.

7
8
9

Hew X submit in this case, clearly ft, Uaccagnino'a j
;

representation was not as effective as it might have been*

|

The obvious reason is that he was appearing before a

i
?

m

trial judge on June 2 heaping blame on his client’s shoulders j

1!

on behalf of the girls, saying that these poor girls were

52

led down the path of perdition by Dubes, and then -two

V4

weeks later he had to appear before the same judge and
implore mercy for his client whom he had just excoriated

15

56

two weeks before.
1 submit at the very least that Mr. Eaccagnin© had

17

a credibility problem with the trial judge who was sitting

IS

listening to his arguments.

59

QUESTION: What if this was all true?

20

MR. WADE: I beg your pardon?

2?

QUESTION: What if these observations of Mr.

22
23

2ace&gr,ino were all true?
MR. WADE: Well, if fchatis the case, then, Mr.

24

Chief Justice, it would seem to me the arguments of counsel

25

were meaningless

l

|]
j

12
QUESTION; Doesn't it often happen that in a.

sentencing process, a lawyer in an effort to present miti­
gating circumstances will make a lot of disparaging statemeats about his client by way of confession

and avoidance?

MR. WADE; Yes, but this is a situation where
he was speaking in behalf of another client.
QUESTION: I am speaking of the sentencing of the
particular client of this particular man, What is so
different about making that comparison in this context as
it happened here two weeks earlier?

10
!

11

|

MR, WADE: Well, Mr. Chi-f Justice, 2 can answer
that this way.

12

It seems to me from, the reading of many

i
I

13 !
i

cases, lower court cases have dealt with this issue.

14 f

They've: gone so far as to say that even if the trial counsel

15

ignores one of his clients, and it is a situation where a

16

lawyer representing two defendants and gets up in sentenc­

1?

ing and says some nice things about one individual and

13

P

doesn’t say anything at all about the other, the courts have

19

held that to foe a conflict or interest, that the client who

20

receives no attention from his lawyer is not getting the

.21

1

representation he -is entitled to.

In other words, it is not

as effective as it might have bean had the conflict not
existed.
Now, Mr. LaBeile in his brief in this Court has
raised tit

>•
us

issue of prejudice. Must you shew prejudice-,

13
•}
*

Well, I subrrd v: that because the attorney-client relationsM P

s

is what it is , and thatthe attorney is taken into the confi

3

deuce of his client, that it should not be the burden of

4

the defendant here in the ordinary sense to have to show

5

the prejudice that may result.

6

Mr. Justice White raised the question whether

V

or not

3

if he got his bargain, what is he complaining about?

9

Well, as I said earlier, that bargain was certainly not

10

binding an the trial judge. Other permissible penalties

11

could have been handed down.

IE

trial court looked upon Dukes before his eves, it seems

13

to me,, 33 something that can’t be answered in this Court

14

because we don’t have that trial judge before us.

the sentence was a result of a bargain, and then

The whole craestion of how

QUESTION: Well, I suppose part of your claim is

!5
16

that, if Zaccagnino had not had a conflict, he might have made

17

a better bargain?

MR. WADE?

18

That is possible.

>.'He might have to go

10

to trial. You have to remember, your Honor, that throughout

20

this proceeding, Dukes had been saying, "I am not. guilty.

Z\

plead not guilty. X don’t want to go forward," He did it

2Z

in the first instance on the original trial date.

23

Pled guilty. He came back and said, "X want to vacate my

2-1

plea."

23

He then

H#;: kept saying, "I’m net guilty."
QUESTIONS I see in your brief you say that when

’.£

14
Zaccagnino was talking in the other case? he pointed out
because of their cooperation with the state police? they
capitulated Dukes into pleading guilty.
MR. WADE: That's correct.
QUESTIONt So he had pleaded guilty in the other

case *
MR. WADE: In Dukes’ case. You see? the girls had
been involved with Dukes over a series of events.

The girls

had been arrested on the particular charge that they
were arrested on? but they were cooperating with the
police not only on that case but on the one we are discussing
QUESTION? You mean he had actually discussed the
case -we have here when he was talking at the sentencing of
the girls in the other case?
MR. WADE? That is correct.
QUESTION: He mentioned this ease?'
MR. WADE: That is correct.

As ha said? he had

both sides cf the case? Mr. Zaccagnino did. He knew what
the girls wera going to say? ho knew what they were going
to testify to, and how it would foe utilised by the state in
evidence against Dukes, so he and his partner Mr. Delaney
kept trying to convince Dukes to plead guilty because they
ks.-sw that these girls were going to corae and say things
about hira on this case, and that ia why? as Mr. 55accagni.no
says, he was capitulated into taking a plea.

Why is it-the state’s respo sibility

MR. WADS: Well, my u dersta di g of the crimi al
>r

16

\

procedure is; that the. state it. not interested in convictions\
they * re interested in justice, and the state has the same
interests at heart

s the defense counsel, the truth.

They are looking for the truth.
QUESTIONi

Well, they approach it in a somewhat

different way, though.
FIR, WADE: Obviously, because of the adversary
state of our law, but the point is, if the state is concerned
only with convicting guilty persons, then they too are
concerned with assuring that all of hi3 constitutional
rights are protected, regardless of whether that attorney,
that defense lawyer is, as you say, breaching the canons
of ethics.

That is the concern of the state also to make

sure that that is not being done, and therefore the trial
judge who sits there, he is the referee and even if the
state does not raise it as they probably would not because
of the adversary circumstances, the trial court has a
responsibility.
QUESTION:

Do you think the trial judge could say,

"I don’t think this lawyer whom you paid a thousand dollars
to, can dc the job”?
MR. WADE:

As Mr. Justice White said in McMarm

vs. Richardson, a year ago, which was a triiogv of cases
♦

uilty pleash, at that time he said he would leave,
to the trial courts the responsibility of ensuring the

17
sompetence, of the trial attorney representing
the defendants before the court of the various states.

judge says, “X don't think this man is ecmpeien t,and

Yes, Mr, Justice?

QUESTION: What. happens?
HR, W&DBs In that situation?
QUESTION: Yes.
MR. WADE: I think if the defense counsel is
incompetent and it is before a trial—
QUESTION: Well, who decides whether he is competent
or not?
MR. WADE: Well, I think the trial judge.
QUESTION: Why did he take the bar exam?

Does the

judge pass on the qualifications of trial lawyers now?
MR. WADE: Well, all I can say in response to that,
I practice in a law firm that has coste 35 lawyers in it,
but of th -t number, I would say 30 have not bean in a trial
court since they passed the bar exam.

They are

not

trial lawyers: they don't handle criminal defense cases.
QUESTION: Well, this man has picked out this lawyer
This is bl-s lawyer, "counsel of his choice,* and he has

18

paid him good cash money and the judge says, "Uh-uh."
Do io th ;. judge get him a better lawyer
or something?

MR. WADE: No, he may not do that.

He might decide

\

that public defenders should get into the case.
QUESTION? And make the man take the public defender?;
MR. WADE: Thates correct.
QUESTION:

But he doesn't want the public defender.

He doesn't went the public defender.
MR. WADE: Well, if on the facts as we have here,
the lawyer is—
QUESTION: We're not talking about the

facts here,

It’s not in this case, and those are the facts I'm on.
MR. WADS: You are saying where the counsel himself
is incompetent and the trial judge thinks he is,
QUESTION: No, I didn't say that. I said the trial
judge says, "I think you are incompetent, so you can't
defend this man."
MR. WADE: Yes. I would submit he has a duty to.
assure that he's getting fair, adequate representation?
that it is effective representation.
QUESTIONs Maybe the judge should represent him,
himself.
MR. WADEs 1 think at some point we have to hva
someone there that is going to—

Far from that*

QUESTION: Wall, where do we get to the incompetent
f

point?

.

MR, WADE: All X am saying—-he’s a very competent

lawyer—all I'm saying is that h this case, he had a conflict

to

of interest that destroyed his effectiveness. Hot that he

n

is incompetent, but his effective assistance of counsel went

12

out the window when he had the interests of these girls

13

co-equal with the interests of his own client, Mr,, Dukes.

14

Kow could ha, Hr. Saceagnino, stand up and lay his'-.burden

16

That’s all X!m saying in this situation.

17

QUESTION: what if this were a civil action, Mr. Wade,j

ie

and a breach of ethics had taken piece?

19

was a victim of that breach of ethics have a constitutional

20

plan to go beyond the state court and come here?

2?

!

Would the client who

MR. WADE: Well, that would be a constitutional
claim because X don’t think the Sixth Amendment protection

tSO

4*0

there would apply, simply because the Sixth Amendment guarantees

24

at X understand it, is intended to protect a citizen from

2»

activities by the state against him, so in a civil claim.

i
I

20

]

there the client might have a civil remedy against

hi-: attorney, assuming he could show some sort of activity
on his part that denigrated his own case, and thereby remove
the attorney from the sphere of proper representation.
QUESTIO?!: He wouldn’t have a due process claim underj
the fovete-.'nth Amendment just because the state conducted
the trial?
MR. WADEs No, I don’t think there would be suf~
fident state action there in order to bring it? that’s my
opinion.

1 have no law to support that, but I don't think

there would be a sufficient state action simply because the
state permitted its facilities to be utilized and its judge
to hear the matter, to raise a due process argument in that
situation.

<

Kow, Mr. L&Belle in his brief has also raised the
issue of the typos of conflict that might exist and that the
true conflict of interest cases arise where there are the
se:v;3 defendants being represented out of the same arrest.
Walls X submit to the court cases in which it has been held
that simply isn’t true.

There are situations where a lawyer

has represented a defendant in a burglary ease and quite
parenthetically he represented the victim of this burglary
in tv. entirely unrelated civil transaction which had nothing
to cc with the particular burglary in question, and there the
court held that was a conflict of interest, for that lawyer

At the time of sen­

there is

November and December 1966 and as a. result of it, the girls

were picked up and when they were picked up, they told the

affidavits, the whole thing, and as a result of that, of coursfe

20

they were arrested and by the way, there were four girls

and another man involved in this besides Dukes.

22

quently, a warrant was issued for the arrest of the girls

in December of 1956 and a warrant was issued for Dukes.

All right, that case gets into the superior court.

7

The girls had cooperated, they get Mr. Eaecagnino to represent
them.

He was representing the girls and Dukes knew it.

Dukes also knew his involvement with the girls.

While

S
10

Mr. Saccagnino was representing the girls in the check case,
Mr. Duke3 went to him and said, "Will you represent me in a

11
12

narcotics case,51 a new narcotics case, not the one that was
involved in the bench warrant, because on March 14, Dukes

13
got arrested again for selling narcotics and this is the

14
case that is in the appendix.

This is the case that is

in the appendix, where the search warrant i3 there, where
16
they went in with a search warrant.

They had made a purchase

17
from Dukes immediately before the warrant was executed.
18
They went to his house and found all kinds of narcotics,
19
a perfectly good, solid, thorough case? and also found
20
stolen goods.

That’s the two counts that he pleaded to.

21

Now, when these cases all came to the court and I
22
had some more cases in superior court against Dukes, I looked
23
in the files and I said the case to try is "the last narcotics
24
case, the one where there was a search warrant, where we had

25

j

28
a' cold caso, rmkas was a second offender, he was warned,
and I set the case down for trial and told Mr. Zaccagnino
to be ready as scon as we got to court.

The records show

that Mr. Zaccagnino was there and this, by the way, was
the week of the second of May 1967.
Mr. Zaccagnino was there, he hung around for that
week and en May 9, it came on.

We got a courtroom, and now

you come to the proceedings in the court on May 9.
Meanwhile, the girls’ case had been going along separata.
There wasn’t any connection with this narcotics case*

-The

girls were not witnesses in it, they had nothing to do
with it.

It has never been claimed they had anything to do

with it.

The girls pleaded guilty, and their cases

were waiting to be sentenced, and there was no connection,
whatsoever with this case that was ready for trial.
Now, when

he got ready for trial, he had to be

pinned to the mat in order to get the plea and that’s when
this conflict originally came up between Mr. Zaccagnino
and Mr. Dukes, and it

says in the colloquy on May 9,

"There*a a slight conflict between my client and me,"
because Mr* Zaccagnino in his best judgment was advising
him, "You’ve got to plead guilty. You’ve got all these
cases pending against you.”

He had warrants outstanding on

the check charges in New Raven and Fairfield County.

to Dukes, "Your only chance here is to plead guilty

and wipe up all of these cases at once, and I'll gc- to the
State’s Attorney and gat a recommendation," which he did.
It didn't go on Kay 9 because it was continued because of
Mr, Zaccagnino advising him and his not taking his advice
and it was continued for one day.

Then it was postponed

for a week and went over to May 16,
On May 13* Dukes came back into court with My.
Delaney*

Mr. Saccagnino’s partner* now, and the same thing

happened all over again. X was ready in court with a court­
room and jury and the witnesses to put the narcotics case on,
and finally, after a lot of negotiations during the morning,

is

Mr„ Dukes pleaded guilty and the proceedings of May 16

14

show that, and this is when Judge Johnson now was the judge.

QUESTION:

Well, at that time had you had some con­

HR. LaBELLE;

17

if Dukes‘punishment in the girls9 case was still in question,

IB

Zaccagrtino representing the girls and Dukes, in another

case, wouldn't be about to say that about Dukes,

20

he shouldn’t anyway, should he?

28

MR. LaBSLLE:

22
*->

I mean,

Yes, that’s correct, your Honor.

If, for instance, we came in and put Dukes on in the check
case later on and Zaecagninorwas representing him there,

24

then he would have had a conflict, of course, but it didn't

ac5

happen that way; and it hasn't happened.

There was an

i

33
; v-r-.-'i':'n

there was to be concurrent sentences.

That is

in the record, page 120( 123 of the Appendix that this was the
agree:.': recommendation to get concurrent sentence wrapping up
all of these cases.
QUESTION: But that was only on your recommendation.
Fft.

La BELLE:

Oh, yes.

Judge Devlin wasn’t bound

by it of course but it is significant that on June 16,
when Dukes was sentenced in the narcotics case, Judge
Devlin followed the recommendation.

Now on June 16, it

is significant that there was nothing before Judge Devlin
to remind him about Dukes being involved with the girls.
It wasn’t in the probation report, Dukes' probation report—
it wasn't mentioned.

No one mentioned it to Judoe Devlin,

and now counsel says,

“But Judge Devlin heard it two weeks

ago, and he probably remembers it.”
QUESTION: But didn’t your argument include working
out or doing something with Dukes' penalty in the girls’
check case?
MR. LaBELLE: Yes, it did, and on June 16~~
QUESTION: Well, did that take judicial concurrence?
MR. LaBELLE:

No, because we never brought those

cases up before Judge Devlin for disposition.
QUESTION: You nolle proased them?
viRa LaBE’LLE: I did afterwards because on June 16,
Dukes refused to plead to the eases that were being

34
* H

conso'1 idated and refused to plead to anything else.

z

Ke changed his wind.

i!

Then he asked to have his case post­

had a whole month to make up your mind about this, from

You haven't clone anything about it.

is simply a ploy to get delay in your sentencing.

and ho never mentioned any conflict of interest. He had anotbe

n

He brought habeas corpus into the federal court and he

w

didn’t mention conflict of interest, and when you look at the

IQ

transcript in this case, to this day Dukes doesn't claim

20

that Mr. Zaccagnino gave him anything but good service.

2?

As a matter of fact, the plea bargain he got, if you look

22

at the record of all these cases, he got a good result.

23

Mr. Zaccagnino did a fine job for him.

if Mr. Dukes wanted to claim this conflict of interest on

the day he was sentenced on June 16, he should have said

something to the court. He asked for other counsel, he was

Now, since ha had to have known about it, he must
have known about it on June 2, and that's the day, two

40
weeks later on June 16* if he had known about it, he
should have told Judge Devlin, " Jlm not being properly
represented because of a conflict of interest,”
QUESTION:

Can you mathematically rule out the pcss

bility that he could have found out about it on June 16?
MR, LaBELLE:

I agree, your Honor, I said earlier

that I couldn't guarantee he was in the courtroom when it
happened, and I can't yet but I finally found it and it is
on page 163 of the Appendix and I am asking him about
being in court on June 2, I was trying to establish that he
might have heard the girls when they were sentenced.
He? says he wasn't but no listen to this, at the
top of page 163, this is his answer: ”Iem trying to think
of the data the girls got sentenced because I was not in
court on the day they got sentenced, because I know I wasn't
in court that specific day because that's when I was told
what was said about me," so there it is, that’s the key
to the whole case.

He knew what was said about him.

He knew when it was said about him.

He never complained,

ha never fold judge Devlin about it on June 16, and if he
wanted to, he should have raised it then and he had plenty
of opportunity because the record indicates Jude

Devlin

gave him every chance to speak and tell what his trouble
was«
Nov;, it is clear that if you are going to allege

41

this kind of conflict, of interest, there is a duty to

notify the trial court and give the- trial court a chance

to rule on it. Here you have what we’rs saying in this

QUESTIONs Wall, he certainly knew the fact that
Eaccagnin® was representing both the girls and Dukes?

MR, LaBEX:-LEi

I think so. You must presume that if

he remembered what happened two weeks before. I'm not sure
it

of that. I don’t know.

This was a busy court. He had a lot

ta

of cases.

and that this was the same Dukea, I don’t know.

Whether or not he remembered the girls' case

MR. LaBELLE: June IS was two weeks later and a lot

Zaccagnino was there.

21

MR, LaBELLEt Yes, Just continuance.

QUESTION:

23

All right, then either before or after

that on the same day, Zaccagnino is representing the girls?

MR. LaBEUiEs

Right.

HR. LaBHLLEr

Yes* I ‘m net saying Judge

Devlin may not have remembered, hut what is done here, if

3

it isn't specifically called to his attention, his presuming

4

that he took into consideration in sentencing Dukes on the

5

narcotics case, some other information he had from outside

e

and you can’t presume that a trial judge is doing something

7

wrong unless he’s been notified about it, and in this

8

instance. Judge Devlin certainly didn't do anything other

than follow the state's recommendation, the agreed recommends

say even if he remembered the Dukes case, that he had done

to overrule Judge Devlin in a matter that he never even had

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. WADE,ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

HE. WADE:

Hr. Chief Justice, if I may address

myself to two remarks that Mr. I.a3elle raised, the
first is he said everything was in the pre-sentencing report
and Judge Devlin had it all before him anyway, so what
difference did it make what Mr. Zaccagnino said? 1 say in
i
response to that, that's when you need your own lawyer.

I
■

If he's get all that information before him, you should have
your own lawyer there who is at least

answering those

charges in the pre-sentencing report to the trial judge, and
that Mr. Zaccagnino did not do.

Indeed, what he did

do was compound the—*
QUESTION: Let’s suppose, to take your: hypothetical,
that there had been two separate lawyers, are you suggesting
that clay that this man was entitled to have a latgyer there to
hear what was being said about him?
MR. WADE:

No# X don’t claim that at all.

QUESTION: I wouldn't think so.
MR. WADS: What 2 am saying, obviously, is that
the Pennsyovania court said you've got to go back to the
date of the guilty plea itself, to examine the type of
advice that the defendant is getting from his lawyer at that
point, not at the time of sentencing? the time of sentencing
is merely symptomatic.

What happened two weeks earlier when

by Mr. ZaccagninoJs own admission and Mr. Delaney’s own
admission, they vrore working on Dukes to convince him to plead
