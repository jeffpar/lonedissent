MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

first in No. 71-81, United States against Biswell.
Mr. Greenawalt, you may proceed whenever you're
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. KENT GREENAWALT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GREENAWALT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is on review of the decision of the Court
of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, that an agent of. the Alcohol,.
Tobacco and Firearms Division of the Treasury Department
searched Respondent Biswell's business premises in violation
of the Fourth Amendment.
The issue involved is a narrow one:

whether Congress,

in regulating the distribution of firearms, may authorize
Treasury agents to make routine inspections during business
hours of the business premises of licensed dealers in firearms,
and whether Congress may impose upon these licensed dealers
a duty to admit the agents even though the agents do not
possess a warrant.
Putting the question somewhat differently:

does

the congressional authorization of such inspection and the
imposition of a duty upon licensed dealers to admit the agents
u

without warrants conflict with the Fourth Amendment?

We believe the constitutionality of the authorisation
and the duty Congress has imposed is plain under Colonnade
Catering Corporation vs. United States, and that therefore the
court below erred.
The relevant facts in this case are quite straight­
forward.
Mexico,

Loarn Anthony Biswell is a pawnbroker in Hobbs, New
A substantial number of the items pawned with him, as

security for loans, are firearms.

At the time of the inspec­

tion here he held some 444 firearms.
dealer in firearms.

Biswell was a licensed

Under Section 923 of Title 18, dealers in

firearms must be licensed, and dealers are specifically defined
to include pawnbrokers.
Special investigator Hupp of the Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms Division made a routine compliance visit to Biswell's
pawnshop.

According to Hupp, such visits to dealers are made

about once a year.

Hupp identified himself, and first

inquired about Biswell’s records.
Ha ascertained that Biswell was not keepingrecords in the form required of all firearms dealers.

Hupp

then indicated that he wished to see the storerooms where the
firearms were kept.

Biswell kept these, along with other

pawned items, in a locked storage room.
Biswoll inquired if Hupp had a search warrant, and
Hupp said no.

But ho showed Biswell a copy of the statute

authorizing Treasury agents to search the business premises of

5
firearms dealers without warrants.
At that point, Biswell said:
says, so I guess it's okay.

Well, that's what it

And he unlocked the storeroom.

Inside the storeroom Hupp saw a rifle with an 11-3/4-inch
barrel.

Any rifle with a barrel of less than IS inches is an

illegal firearm under the National Firearms Act of 1968.
That Act does not absolutely forbid possession of such fire­
arms, but sharply constricts rifle possession and commerce
in such firearms.
Each such firearm must have a serial number, each
dealer in such firearms must pay a special occupational tax,
and be specially registered with the Secretary of the Treasury.
And whenever any such firearm is transferred, the transferror
must pay a $200 transfer tax and obtain approval of the Secre­
tary of the Treasury.
It was clear to Agent Hupp that Biswell did not
legally possess the sawed-off rifle he saw.
required serial number on the rifle.

Thera was no

Biswell indicated that

he had no idea such weapons had to ba specially registered.
Finally, it was obvious that no owner x*;ould pay a transfer
tax of $200 to get a three-dollar loan, although, of course,
Hupp didn't know the amount of the loan/ but he knew it was
much less than the $200, from a pawnbroker.
Soon after saeing this rifle, Hupp noticed another
with a short barrel, and he seised both rifles.

6

The district judge denied a motion to suppress the
two sawed-off rifles, and they were introduced at Biswell‘s
trial.

They and the observations of them by Agent Hupp were

relevant to the count for which Biswell was convicted, engaging
as a dealer in illegal firearms without having paid the special

occupationa1 tax.
Among other claims on appeal, Biswell claimed that
the search leading to the seizure of the rifles was
unconstitutional.

The Court of Appeals agreed that the search

was unconstitutional and that the evidence should have been
suppressed, and it reversed the conviction.
1 think it may fo® useful at the outset to put aside
which is not involved in this case.

There is no assertion by

Biswell that Hupp performed other than routine actions under
the statute.

It is not disputec3 that he was engaged in the

periodic compliance visit.

It is not disputed that such

visits typically involve inspection of the firearms on the
premises.

And if the entry into the storeroom was valid, the

appropriateness of the seizure of the two truly contraband
weapons is not challenged.
At the same time it is clear that Biswell unlocked
the door to the storeroom because he acquiesced in an apparent
show of lawful authority.
In an ordinary criminal investigation his action would
not have constituted consent to an otherwise unauthorised

7
search.

Thus we do not argute that this search was consented

to in the ordinary sense of consent.

The case thus presents

very clearly the power of Congress to authorize Treasury
agents responsible for enforcement of the firearms laws, to
authorize those agents to inspect the business premises of
firearms dealers without warrant.
Both the criminal code and the Internal Revenue Code
contain a multiplicity of regulations governing the sale and
distribution of firearms.
I talcs it there can be no question of the importance
of close regulation of the gun industry.

Approximately 60

percent of the murders in the country are by use of firearms,
as are 95 percent of the killings of police officers on duty.
The power of Congress to requiro licenses and registration and
to tax incidents of the gun industry has been consistently
upheld.

That power is not questioned in this case.
As a central aspect of the regulatory scheme,, Section

923(g) of Title 18 provides for inspection. The relevant
language for this case is "The Secretary may enter during
business hours the premises {including places of storage) of
any firearms or ammunition .... dealer .. for the purpose of
inspecting ... my firearms or ammunition kept or stored by
such ... dealer ... at such premises.”
The clear import of this section is that Treasury
agents need not have a warrant to inspect, and that licensed

s
dealers have a duty under the statute to permit inspection»
This section is virtually identical with the section considered
by this Court in Colonnade Catering Corporation vs. United
Statas.
In Colonnade, this Court held, with three dissents,
that Congress had not authorised entry by physical force with­
out a warrant.

The significance of this case for this one,

however, is in the Court9s reasoning.
The Court acknowledged that Treasury agents have been
given broad authority to enter and inspect the premises of
liquor dealers, and it determined that this authority is
constitutional.

Both the majority and the dissenters agreed

that the rule of Camara vs. Municipal Court and See vs. City of
Seattle was inapplicable to that case? that rule, of course,
is the one that requires a warrant for an administrative
search that has not been consented to.
But, as I said, all of the Justices agreed that that
rule was inapplicable.
Q

But there is a little difference between liquor

and a gun search.
MR. GHEENAWALT:
Q

There is. Your Honor.

Unless you could flush a gun down a toilet.

MR. GHEENAWALT:

I believe, Your Honor, that for all

relevant purposes, if that kind of search is — or inspection
is sustainable with respect to the liquor industry, it should

B
be sustainable with respect to regulation of the gun industry.
Q

Historically? historically, certainly my

brother Marshall is Correct that government regulation of the
production, sals, and distribution of alcoholic spirits has
been pervasive, almost from the beginning, through the history
of the Eighteenth Amendment and the Twenty-first Amendment,
and long before then, by contrast with firearms which has not
been regulated until a very relatively rescent day.
correct?

Isn’t that

Regulated by the States of the nation, you have the MR. GREENAWALT:
Q

Yes, that is essentially correct.

— constitutional amendment in the Bill of

Rights on firearms which runs the other way.
MR. GREENAWALT; Well, I do not think it runs the
other way, because that amendment has not been interpreted to
protect the right of individuals to —
Q

I know that it’s not comparable with respect

to alcoholic spirits.
MR. GREENAWALTs That’s right.

It certainly is

true that the history of close regulation of the liquor
industry is a much older one than close regulation of the gun
industry.
Q

And has been pervasive throughout our history.

MR. GREENAV7ALT:

It has been pervasive.

There were ~~
Q

The close regulation, by contrast, with firearms

10
MR. GREENAWALT:

Yes, Your Honor.

There were old

statutes before the Constitution was adopted that prohibited
concealed weapons, and State regulation of the gun industry
has proceeded in this century, and there were federal laws on
the books as early as 1934.

so when you say recent, it isn't

the last few years, but it certainly —• it isn't the long
history; the history isn't of such close regulation as existed
with respect to the liquor industry.
It’s our contention, however, that reasonableness
under the Fourth Amendment in this context, in determining
what kinds of inspections require warrants, if has to be
determined with a view toward an evolving society and the
needs of the society at this time.

And we do not see how it

can be said that despite the greater history of regulation of
the liquor industry, that the need for inspections is greater
with regard to liquor than it is with respect to lethal
weapons.
So our

and I think that's borne out by the

findings of Congress in passing the most recent legislation
in 1968, the —~
Q

Mr. Creenawalt, what in your view, what protec­

tion, in your view, doa3 the constitutional right to bear
arms roach and protect a dealer in arms?
MR. GEEENAWALT: A.3 1 understand the way the Court
has interpreted that constitutional protection, it essentially

Ii
relates to the State's militia, and X think that it doesn't
foreclose close regulation of dealers in firearms any more than
it forecloses the forbidding of the carrying of certain, or
possessing of certain kinds of firearms.

So essentially it's

our contention that it has no relevance.
Q

Mr. Greenawalt, supposing this were the

securities industry* which I take it was not regulated at all
in 1739, but as of 30 to 40 years ago it is now very heavily
regulated.

Would you feel an administrative search of this

type could be justified of a.securities dealer just as well as
of a gun dealer?

MR. GREENAWALT;

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we think

that you have to look at each area, to see whether the test of
Camara should apply or the test, of Colonnade.

We do not think

the fact that there is not a long history dating back to the
time of the Constitution of inspection without warrants is
determinative.

But it might well be that the securities

industry would be different from the gun industry.
Q

Why?

MR. G:XEENAWMjT;

Well, 1 think the — maybe it would

be useful if 1 say why X think, the gun industry, like the
liquor industry, is appropriately subject to this kind of
inspection.

First of all, unlike the ordinary homeowner or

the person who had business premises in See, this is not a
citisen who is just subject to searches that happen to every

12
homeowner or every owner of a business office.

This is someone

who is licensed in a particular industry, in a very closely
regulated industry, who knows who the authorities are that have
power to inspect, what agency it is that's regulating the gun
industry.
So that, first of all, when an agent of the Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms Division shows up at his premises, ho is
virtually certain that there is proper authority in that
officer to inspect, assuming that there isn't the problem, 1
think, that there was in Camara or in See that somebody might
show up and. the homeowner or the warehouse owner wouldn't know
whether this fellow really had the power to make a search.
. Secondly, and X suppose this is quite crucial, this
is not like an ordinary administrative inspection.

Xf there

is a fire hazard, faulty wiring, or defective elevators, and
the inspector shows up and says, nX want to check your wiring;
X want to look at your elevators", if entry is refused, it's
unlikely that the condition is going to be corrected within
three or four hours, or however long it would take to get a
warrant.
If the condition is corrected, the substantial
purpose of the administrative regulation is achieved, since
the substantial purpose is to correct the wiring or to get
the elevator in proper working order.

And that just isn't

true here in respect to these inspections.

13
Whan the inspector shows up, if he has to go for a
couple of hours to get a warrant, a gun dealer can just put
aside whatever weapons may be illegal? the inspector comes bade
with his warrant, he makes the inspection, he doesn't find the
guns, and then the gun dealer puts the weapons back in their
place»

X mean, the entire purpose of the inspection would fee

thwarted,
Well, I think I'll stop there.
Q

Is this statute somewhat analogous to the

provisions of the National Banking Act that authorized bank
examiners to swoop in on a bank without any notice, or without
any warrant, and examine the books and count the money in the
cash drawer and securities in the safe?
MR. GREENAWALT:

It is essentially similar to that.

yes.
Q

SSas that ever been — has the right of the bank

examiner ever been challenged in any federal case that you're
aware of?

I know of none in this Court.

Has it ever been

challenged?
MR. GREENAWALT:

Not so far as I'm aware, Your Honor.

There are a groat many statutes of this kind, and 1 did inquire
about some of them.

For instance, the Federal Aviation

Agency has the power to inspect airports and so on.

And I

gather that in most instances, that in those activities there
is fairly close cooperation and a desire not to upset the

14
federal agency that's governing, and so the searches are
consented to as a matter of course.
That seems to foe the typical experience.
0

Mr. Greenawalt, factually there was reference,

and you made it, to the fact that this man said, "Well, if
that's the law, then of course you can come in.”
■In the licensing process itself, when one obtains a
■*
license of this kind, is he given a copy of the statute?
MS. GREENAWALT:

Yes, I believe so.

It appears

in the record that copies of the statute were mailed to Biswell,
and that Agent Hupp saw on his desk or at some point there was
a warrant to seise the rest of the rifles the next day, and
he returned to the pawnshop, I think at that point he saw a
copy of the regulations that certainly Biswell had been
notified of the content of the statute and had received the
regulations, indicating both what tha substantive regulations
were and the power of the agents of the division to search
his premises? inspect his premises.
Q

;3q your position is that there wasn't any

surprise on his part?
MR. GREENAWALT:

Well, he did make the claim at

trial that he subjectively was surprised, that these weapons
were outlawed.

But they have bean outlawed since 1934, and

in fact, although wo believe that it was not necessary under
Freed vs, United States, the district judge gave a rather

15
favorable instruction which I think the jury would not have —
under which I think the jury would not have convicted unless
he believed that Biswell did know that these firearms were
illegal fireanirs under the National Firearms Act»
Q

Mr. Greenawalt, if Biswell had refused Hupp's

entry to the locked vault, what then would have been the
position?
MR. GREENAWALT:

Well, as we think the clear

implication of Colonnade is, that if the liquor dealer had
refused entry he could appropriately be punished.
the opinion says:

In.fact,

whether the imposition of a fine for

refusal to permit entry is under the statutory scheme the
exclusive sancition, absent a warrant to break and enter.
Q

Yes, but a different offense than the one on

which he was convicted.
MR. GREENAWALT: That’s correct.

Yes, we believe
t

that there's general language —
Q

Well, Rupp could not have broken in.

MR. GREENAWALT: That's correct.

And under Colonnade,

he
Q

But if he had broken in and seised, then

■Colonnade would have made it —
MR. GREENAWALT: Absolutely.
Q

Yes.

But you r€ily on "If that's the law, then I guess

it's all right"?

16
MR, GRBENAWALTs Well, we rely on that, in that it —
Q

la what?

MR. GREEHAWALTs
sensa.

Hot as consent in the ordinary

Now. 1 say .in the ordinary sense, because there is a

qualification that I'd like to make.
Q

Well, I notice that Justice Clark's opinion

below says that the government argued in that court the
appellant consented.

You're not making that argument hare?

MR. GREENAWALTs

I’m certainly not making the argument

that this is consent in the ordinary Fourth Amendment sense.
It is arguable that it is either consent in the sense that he
got a license knowing what the regulatory scheme was, and
since it was reasonable he sort of undertook this kind of
obligation.

There is that argument.

And there is also an argument that can be drawn from
the opinion in Davis vs. United States, which suggests that
the standard of consent may foe different if there is a duty
to admit someone or, in that case it was public property,
rationing stamps that were involved.
Q

Well, Mr. Greenawalt, it is consent in the sansa

that it serves to negative the use of force,
MR. GREEMAWALT:

That’s correct.

acquiescence on lawful authority.
Q

It was an

That's the position.

Yes.

That's the point that gets you around Colonnade.

MR. GREEHAWALT:

Absolutely

1?
Q

I me&n if he hadn’t acquiesced, you would have

had some problems.
MR, GREENAWALT; Absolutely.
Q

So it is a critical point.

MR, GKEEHAWALT:

It’s a critical point, the fact

that ha unlocked the warehouse himself.
Q

Well, what do you do with Justice Clark's

disposition of it on Bumper?
MR. GREENAWALTs Well, we just think that Bumper is
not applicable.

Bumper is an ordinary Fourth Amendment case,

the kind of consent that’s involved there is the.free,
voluntary agreement to do something that you’re not legally
required to do,

1 mean this is the key point in the case, can
Congress legally require the licensed firearm dealer to open
up his storage room?

If it can legally require it, then that

eliminates the problem of physical entry that was posed in
Colonnade, and it —*
Q

Well, you:1 re’ saying, can Congress give the

dealer a choice between going %o jail and letting people in?
MR, GREENAWALTj That's correct.
Q

I mean, you say to him?

or you’ll go to jail.

Either you let us in,

But you have your choice? you can go

to jail i£ you don't want to let us in.
MR. GREENAWALTs

And we can’t break in,

That’s why we argue that it’s not

13
consent in the ordinary sense•
But, again, I return to Mr. Justice Douglas’s opinion
in Colonnade,

It was assumed in that case that ha could be

punished for refusing to open the storeroom.
Q

Was it also assumed in that case that Congress

could even authorize the agent to break in?
MR. GREENAVJALTs

Ko, it was assumed that it couldn’t

well, as to whether it could, 2 would say yes, that the
implication in the opinion is that Congress could.
of course is not involved here.

But that

We don’t argue that Congress

has done that.
Assuming that -•*Q

Well, is it clear to you that if he said, "Yes,

2 read the law here that you’re shewing me? but 2*m not
going to let yon in" that he would have been guilty of a
criminal violation then and there?
MR. GREENAWALTs

Yes.

1 think one could make an

argument on the other side, but that is our position, that 924
-«■ you don’t have the kind of specific language that you had in
Colonnade about refusal to enter.

But 924 does make it a crime

to violate any provision of this chapter.
Wow, va believe that the inspection provision gives
a pure right to the agent to enter and that therefore, if
that entry is refused, that that’s a violation of the chapter.

Q

Well, it doesn't explicitly, at least, impose

19

an obligation?
MR. GREENAWALT t There is -Q

There's none of that.

Revenue officers may eater.

It just says Internal

It doesn't say all licensees must

permit agents to enter.
MR, GREENAWALTs That's correct, Mr,, Justice Stewart.

It's ~
Q

That makes the differences

MR. GREENAWALTs

permitting.

Well, you do not have the specific

language that you had in Colonnade, but we think that that
worry is surplusage, that the clear implication of that
provision is that the agents have authority to enter and that
therefore the dealer had the duty to allow them to enter.
Even if we were wrong about that, in terms of whether
it's criminally punishable, whether 924 spells out the
criminal sanction with such clarity that a refusal to allow
entry would be a criminal violation, we still think it’s clear
that, the import of the statute is that under the statute
dealers are supposed to allow entry,

And so then we give up

by saying that you have a duty which might result in loss of
license, might not result in criminal sanctions.

But, never­

theless, a duty legally imposed by Congress,
So that once you do allow the entry, that's an
acquiescence of the lawful duty imposed by Congress and that
makes the inspection proper, and that the fruits of the

20

draissibl© in evidence in a criminal
trial.
Q

Xt*s not, therefore, a necessary part of your

argument at all that his refusal to permit entry would be a
criminal offense under the statute?
MR. GREENAWALT:

No.

X would say it is a necessary

part of our argument that he . lias a duty that he —
Q

That Congress authorized the agents to enter.

MR. GREENAWALT;

Yes.

And the implication is that

you're not supposed to keep the storeroom locked if the agents
want to enter.
Q

Yes.
Right.

MR. GREENAWALT; That is necessary»

But the criminal

sanction is not.
Q

Right.

. MR. GREENAWALTs While X deal briefly with a point
that is raised in the amicus brief by the Civil Liberties
Onion, if the inspection was lawful, we think it is clear that
the evidence is admissible in a criminal trial.

Again going

back to Colonnade, that evidence presumably would have been
admissible in a criminal trial.
in that case.

The evidence was suppressed

Thera were criminal sanctions, as there are

here, for the violation of the regulation in Colonnade as well
as her©; and this Court has always assumed that contraband
found in the course of a lawful inspection can properly foe

21
introduced in evidence.
In short, in susaraar, it *3 our position that Colonnade
dictates reversal of the decision below, unless the major
reasoning in that opinion is to be repudiated, or the
regulation of the gun industry is to be distinguished from the
regulation of the liquor industry; and we urge very strongly
that in light of present social conditions, it must be that
Congress has as much power over the gun industry in these
terms as it does over the liquor industry.
I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for
rebuttal.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs Very well.
Mr. Reynolds.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN F. REYNOLDS # ESQ.,
OH BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. REYNOLDS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please

the Court;
Our position, as far as Issue One is concerned in
the petitioners brief, is that not only does the gun
inspection statute violate the Fifth Amendment rights of the
respondent

I mean the Fourth Amendment, it also violates

the Fifth, thereby forcing upon him the obligation to allow
inspection he thereby incriminates himself with any criminal
act of discovery.
At the outset, 1 would like to point out to the Court

22

that this cajae xp, I don’t believe that it was relevant to the
argument before the Court, but 1 would like to point out that
Mr. Biswell was found innocent of four possession charges
of the guns, and found guilty of not being licensed, so, query?
What did the jury believe?
I believe weare ell confused about that opportunity.
But getting to the constitutional question, actually what the
petitioner is advocating here is the same thing that Frank
did, which this Court overruled later, that is, create an
additional exception to general rule, under the constitution,
that there must be a search warrant with probable cause before
you can search not only private homes but the private portions
of the premises of businessmen.
And in Prank, as the Court recalls, the Court in
that case said, Well, if this is an administrative .search
which is essentially civil in nature, no criminal investiga­
tion, there are safeguards, then, we will allow such a search
and call it to be constitutional.
This Court, in the Colonnade case, which See followed,
as far as commercial premises are concerned, indicated other­
wise .
&fc the outset I would like to point out that it is
the respondent's feeling that there is a much greater issue
facing this Court today, other than just the gun statute,
which is the subject of this case.

As the petitioner cited in

23
his brief, in hi: footnotes, there are sortie dozen pieces of
federal legislation existing today v;hich call for inspection
of premises of businessmen, all the way from poultry, drugs,
on to a new Act, which we have now, the National Safety and
Health Practices Act.
Now, prior to the enactment of this Act, most of
these Acts were a specialised area of business.

And probably

didn’t step on the toss of as many people as this new Act will.
This Act covers all employers whose businesses, are engaged
in commerce, and it contains penalties of up to $20,000 in one
year for violations.
So I think that
Q

What’s this new Act directed to?

Is it on

pollution?
MR. REYNOLDS s

This is the Safety and Health

:

Practices Act, Mr. Justice, it’s pointed at unsafe practices
on business premises that are injuring employees.

And they have

an inspection provision in there, no call for a search warrant,
and they have very heavy penalties.
Q

Is that in your brief?

Do you make reference

to that?
MR. REYNOLDS: The reference to the statute is in the
petitioner's brief, Your Honor.
Q
concept?

What do you mean, it's a safe-place-to-work

Is this it?

MR. REYNOLDS;

Yes.

Yes, it is, Your Honor»

Arid there's a reference
Q

That is, if there are facts of unrepaired broken

stairways, and things like that?•
MR. REYNOLDS:

I think it goes to machinery, almost

any type of unsafe practice.

And the statute calls for

inspections, in fact it calls for surprise inspections-

Zt*s

similar in nature to your banking statute.
But it has far-reaching effects, and 1 think that —
Q

Are we to take it that what you're suggesting is

that all of those statutes, like the present one before the
Court, violate the Fourth or Fifth Amendment., or both?
MR. REYNOLDS: To please the Court,
violate both Amendments.

I think they

First, they violate the Fourth;

Amendment because they invade the privacy right .that we Save
Wilder the Fourth? and they also invade our self protection
right.

But not only that they also invade the Fifth Amendment

whereby we're guaranteed a right not to be self-incriminated.
And the large thrust of the —
Q

Well, what is their testimonial about finding

improper guns?
MR. REYNOLDSs

If it please the Court, it’s evidence

against a licensee in this situation, and if, according to
Q

Of course, the guns are evidence against him?

MR. REYNOLDS:

Yes,

Yes.

25
Q

But how do you get the — how does that become

?
testimonial?

I thought we drew a distinction in Smerber

in that line of cases between testi .
MR. REYNOLDS s.

and non

timonial.

If it please the Court, I know that

this Court overruled Frank, but Frank did indicate that there
was also the Fifth Amendment danger in this sort of situation,
in that if I, as a condition of a license, have a duty to
inspect, x*hieh the government contends, then I, in essence,
have submitted myself to the government obtaining evidence
against ms which would be incriminating.
This is what the government is arguing, that
actually there’s an implied consent here to the search.
And that as a requirement of the license, in the giving of a
privilege, the government requires that t give up my Fourth
and Fifth Amendment rights.
Q

What 1 don’t understand is that we've said that

handwriting, fingerprints, things of that nature are not
testimonial and therefore not involved in the privilege against,
self-incrimination,

Now, I don’t quite understand how this

issues.
MR. REYNOLDSj Well, I think it's a broad proposition,
Your Honor.
Q

You’re relying, I gather, on Mr. Justice

Black’s view, that he expressed in —
MR. REYNOLDSs

Yes.

26

Q

““ Mapp- v. Ofrjo, and without his view, Mapp v.

Ohio could not or would not have been decided the way it was.
ME, REYNOLDS: tod I think the Dourt recognized this
in Frank» where they indicated that they recognized the fact
that in almost all these search and seizures that were
condemned under the Fourth Amendment, they were also condemnabis
under the Fifth Amendment, in forcing a man to have his
premises searched without consent so that he would be
incriminated»
Q

So you’re saying every illegal search is a

violation of the Fifth Amendment as well as the Fourth?
MR. KSYSfOLDS:

I believe it is, Your Honor,

I think

ii*s more aptly pointed out in this case —
Q

At least if it turns up something that tends

to prove a criminal violation —
Q

And that is introduced against him,

q

*— by the owner of the premises, and that is

introduced against him?
MR. REYNOLDS:

Yes,

And it*s introduced against

him.
Q

'Does that apply to all the liquor laws?

MR. REYNOLDS:
0

I think it would, Your Honor, and —

Well, that upsets some pretty old cases,

MR. REYNOLDS:

I realise that, but 1 think that the

safeguards — 1 mean,, this is my feeling, there*s no specific

language» but 1 believe that thu safeguards that were spoken
of in Colonnade were More broad than just the mere procedure
that an inspector went through*

1 think the safeguards,, and

the only safeguards that any person in this position» who is
a licensee * and whose premises must be inspected and if the
courts feel that it’s in the public interest they must b®
inspected, then there should fee a provision in that Act that
any infractions found of a criminal nature would not be used
as evidence against him in a criminal proceeding.
This would be similar to the Hayes, th® legislation
that arose out of the Hayes decision» --- the Haines decision
in 1968» the Congress, in the Federal Firearms Act, enacted a
statute specifically to overcome the effect in that case,
Q

Well, your point is whether or not they can be

licensed? is that your point?
MR. REYNOLDSs
Q

1 beg your pardon?

Whether or not they can bo required to have a

license?
MR. REYNOLDS:

No, I'm not disputing the fact that

the requirement to have a license is unconstitutional.
C

Well, what would be the purpose of the license?

MR. REYNOLDS: The purpose of the license would be to
insure compliance with the Act, insure that a proper person —
Q

Now could that be found out without inspection*?

MR. REYNOLDSi Well, I -- what I am not saying, per se.

28
is- that inspection whould not foe in these statutes.
u-r ybng i.s that on a cat

What 1 am

:ase basis this Court and the

lower courts look at the situation, that if the public interest
i& not deterred by requiring a search warrant? then let’s
protect the privacy interests of the businessman *
These statutes are rapidly encroaching upon all
areas of our life, and, on the other hand, if as in Colonnade
and if the government is correct -0

Well, if in Colonnade they had found poisoned

whiskey, it's your position that there's nothing the
government could do?
MR. E2YH0LDSs

My suggestion is that they should have

gotten a search warrant in that case, Your Honor.
Q

But just suppose the poisoned whiskey was

sitting on the counter outside.
MR. REYNOLDSi

On the counter outside? Well, I think

there have been decisions that if it’s in a public area, then
it. certainly can foe inspected.
Q

Which you're saying in this area?

MR. REYNOLDS;
Q

That’s what I'm saying.

MR. REYNOLDS;
Q

Wall, this wasn't a public area.

Yes.

There's no objection to that.

But now if they

go in the back there and they find poisoned whiskey, they
can't use it?

29
MR. REYNOLDS:
Q

Not unless they have a search warrant.

And by the time you got to the door, to get

ready to go to get the search warrant» where would you think

the poisoned whiskey would be?
MR. REYNOLDS: Well, I believe that we've had several
cases, I've cited in my'brief., that sa

here's no problem if

one of the officers was hanging around keeping them from
disposing of these.
Q

Well, actually, the only purpose was — you

don't oppose the licensing, you're not opposed to that?
MR. REYNOLDSs

No, I'm not opposed to licensing.

I'm not opposed to inspection.
Q

You're not opposed to them being licensed under

the statute which says you shall let them in?
MR. REYNOLDS i
in the alternatives
0

I am opposed to inspections in two,

No. 1» —

I thought you said you didn't mind inspection,

so long as they didn't use it?
MR. REYNOLDSs So long as they — well, No. 1» 1 think
we have to first look at the area of the businessman's privacy.
Now, I think on a case-by-case basis the Court should balance
the interest of the privacy guarantee under the Fourth
Amendment and —
Q

Well, there are a number of reports that a

businessman has to file with the Federal and State government.

30
Rc?w much privacy has he .got left?
MR. REYNOLDSs

He doesn't have much, Your Honor.

But what I’m trying to say is that actually there

lu,B to be a balance, on a case-by~-ca.se basis:

the privacy

of the businessman versus the interest of the public for the
particular Act to be implemented.
Mow. if this Court sees fit to say that the interest
of the public is greater than the Fourth Amendment interest of
privacy, then at that point it is our position that anything
discovered during such an inspection should not be used in a
criminal prosecution against him.

Revoke his license.

But let's not force him, as a privilege

of doing business, to be subject to criminal prosecution.
This is what happened, as a parallel like I said,
in the Haines case.
legislation.

This is what happened with subsequent

They said:

From now on, you still have to

register guns, but v© aren’t going to us a that evidence against
you in a criminal prosecution.
Arid there’s no reason why we can’t do that in these
inspection statutes.

We still accomplish the purpose.

We

inspect, we see that there is no illegal activity, we are able
to trace guns to clear up criminal activity? on the other hand,
we don’t take away this man's constitutional right to the
privilege of doing business.
in other cases.

And this Court has condemned that

31
On the other hand, if he doesn t fulfill his
obligations as a gun dealer, let’s take his license away from
him.

But let's not throw him in jail because we have grant© Ca

him a privilege and in turn took away his constitutional right
This could be done in lots of areas.
Q

Well, wouldn't you make this same argument if

this had been a proceeding to cancel his license, on the basis
of the search that liras made?
MR. REYNOLDSs

I probably would, Your Honor, but 2

don’t think it would be as strong.
[Laughter.. 3
There we’re dealing with a civi.l right, here we're
dealing with criminal prosecution.

We’re dealing with

sentences up to five years in jail»
Incidentally, he received a two-year sentence.
Q

Mr. Reynolds, it seems to me a fair implication

from the Court's opinion in the Colonnade case that if your
client had been in the liquor business and this same thing had
happened, that the*search would have been permissible.

Do you

disagree with that as a statement of the holding or at least
the dicta in the Colonnade case?
MR. REYNOLDS %

If it please the Court, there seems

to be two areas of dicta in that case.

On the one hand, the

Court seems to attempt to distinguish Colonnade from See and
the other case; but, on the other hand, the Court did make a

32
broad statement that there were not reasonable safeguards in
the statute and that, as a consequence, they were going to hold
that the Fourth Amendment had to applyThen they went on and stated that the Congress did
n ot authorise a remedy of forcible entry when consent was
refused, merely a criminal penaltyBut I think that the issue is really narrow in
Colonnade, and I think there's enough dicta there to indicate
that this Court would look at it on a case-by-case basis,

And

1 don't think that —
Q

When you say that, you mean the liquor industry

being one case and the gun industry being another?
MR. REYNOLDS:

Yes, but I don't think the Court even

went as far a3 to say that even in the Colonnade case, I don’t
think it went as far as to say that the government has an
absolute right to inspect, but you can't bust in the door.
They did talk about safeguards in there-

They didn't tell us

what safeguards, but they did talk about them.

And they said

there were no safeguards.
And this certainly isn’t contradictory to Camara and
See.
Q

Don’t you read Colonnade as permitting an

.examination, an inventory of every bottle of liquor that was
in sight of the agent in the Colonnade case?
MR. REYNOLDS:

I don’t — I don’t read it quite that

33

narrowly, Your Honor.

1 think it's a broader holding.

It’s

unfortunate that it was a forced entry? maybe we'd have a
clearer decision today.
But I think that this Court should look at Camara and
Seef and go over the factors that were qone over by this
Court in that case, and determine this case on a case—-by-case
basis.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Greenawalt?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF R. KENT GREENAWALT, ESQ-,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GREENAWALT:
Mr. Chief Justice.

Just very briefly. Your Honor *

We don’t expect the 3ourt or ask the Court

in this case to uphold the inspection provisions of every
federal statute that provides for inspection without a warrant.
We do think that there may be differences and there are
differences in the practices now.
For .instance, I'm told that in regard to inspections
of food, that there's never been any problem because they
would simply stop inspecting the food if the inspections
weren't permitted.
harder to sell,

And then, I suppose, the food would be

Camara and See.

And the considerations there may be quite

different than they are in the gun industry.
Q

What, Mr. Greenawalt — do you have the citation

of the statute that your colleague mentioned;, the more recent
statutet the more general one?
MR. GRSENAWALT:
Q

ilra not sure, Your Honor.

He said it was in your brief.

MR. GREENAWALT:
Q

Xs that in the brief anywhere?

Yes.

.And on Reman iii of your brief there — ii and i

there are three of four dosen statutory citations.
MR. GREENAWALTs

I'm not — it's footnote 5 on page

10j but X*ra not sure precisely which statute he’s referring to.
Q

Well, this one — excuse me.

Q

The citation is there, X take it, somewhere,*

if it is, why, that's all right.
MR. GREENAWALT:

It will be helpful to gat it.

It seems to be Title 29, Section 6S7

I'm not sure ’whether that's in this footiote or not.
Q

29, 657.

That's the one that purports to

authorise inspections of any employer engaged in commerce?
MR. GREENAWALT:

I #m not sure /nether that's an

accurate Statement of the statute.
In any event, we think that the relevant factors
are whether somebody has, namely, undertaken an obligation as
a licensee, the reasonableness of the regulation, whether there

35

is a narrow and closely regulated industry? so that the
authority of the- inspector is known and the person knows the
area to be inspected, how great the invasion of privacy is.
Hare it reached only business premises. 2nd whether there is
a need for surprise, as there is in this case*
Q

Was he on notice that if an inspection is made,

v?hieh comes out as a search, that the material found can be
used against him?

He hasn't consented to that, has he?

MR. GREENAWALT:

X think, Mr. Justice Marshall, ,he

is effectively on notice of that, and I presume that's why he
was hesitant to consent to the inspection in this case.

He

certainly must have viewed it that ’way.
Q
because

You say the only reason he consented was

he assumed the fact, but there's nothing in that

statute that says this information can be used against him.
MR. GREENAWALTi There is nothing, there is not such
specific language to that effect, that
Q

There is no language.

Wall, show me any

language to that effect.
MR. GREENAWALTs The only language — there is no
language to that effect, but there are very substantial
criminal penalties for a variety of acts, and there is a
provision that the Secretary can enter the promises during
business hours to inspect.

Wow, I would think that an

ordinary reasonable businessman would knew that if a criminal

36

violation is found during that inspection, that he’s in serious
trouble and may be prosecuted.

And that the agent is going to

testify as to what ha found in the inspection and is going to
produce any contraband that was seised at that point.
Q

Mr. Greenawait, if these guns were inadmissible

in evidence in a criminal prosecution, under our cases would it
also follow that they could not have been seised at the time';
MR. GREENAWALTt Well, 1 would move it backwards and
say if they can be seized, they can be introduced in a criminal
prosecution, yes.
Q

Yes.

MR. GRSENAWALT;

It would be a novel rule to say

that contraband which is properly seized cannot be introduced
in a criminal prosecution,
Q

Well, what if it were held that they couldn’t

be introduced in a criminal prosecution, could you nevertheless
permit their seizure?
MR. GREENAWALT:

Well, the ACLU accepts that rule

in its amicus brief, it says that you can seize them because
they’re contraband, but because of the self-protection interest
you can’t admit them in a criminal prosecution.

That, as far

as I know, is without support in any opinion that has been
written in the Court, in the majority or in the dissent.
Q

And how about if you couldn’t seize them either,

could you use them — could you use what you saw as a basis for

37
revoking a license?
MR. GREENAWALT; Well, I would think you would run
into the came problem there.

Why should you be able to use it

to revoke a license if you can't use it in a criminal
prosecution?

So again I won 1*3 think the logic of the Court's

Fourth Amendment rulings is that if •—
Q

You don't think really that you could distinguish

between permitting a search for the purpose of enforcing the
obligations of a licensee as against the evidence to be used
in a criminal prosecution?
MR. GREENAWALT: Well, fir-st of all, that would be
inconsistent with anything this Court has ever said about the
Fourth Amendment.

And the Eap case, which is cited in our

brief, is an example of inspection without a warrant, they
are consented to by contract, which was introduced in a criminal
trial? and that's in the assumption of every holding.
Practically, the result of the rule, that kind of
rule in thi-s area, would be to require the government to get
warrants, 1 think-.

It would, since these are \*ery serious

violations of the criminal law.

Most of ;he weapons that arcs

forbidden under the National Firearms Act are things like
machine guns and bombs and hand grenades, in addition to the
sawed-off rifles and shotguns, and if the government, upon
finding that, could not use it as evidence in a criminal
trial, it would certainly defeat the purpose of the inspection.

38

2 might — just one point in answer to Mr. Justice
Marshall's point, the Colonnade statute did not contain any
language of the kind that you suggested, either.

And so 1 again

would say this case is governed by Colonnade on that.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Greenawa.lt.
Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.
The casa is submitted.
[Whereupon, at IQs 54 o’clock, a.iru, the case was
submitted.3
