MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: We will hear arguments
next in No.,. 40, Mary Doe against Bolton,
Mrs, Hamas, you may proceed whenever you’re ready,
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. MARGIE PITTS HAMES,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS, HAMES:

Mr, Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is an appeal from the decision of the Northern
District of Georgia, also a three-judge court, which declared
portions of the Georgia abortion statute unconstitutional.
It ‘upheld certain procedural requirements and
refused to issue an injunction in support of the declaratory
judgment.
The parties here include:

Mary Doe, a pregnant

woman, a married pregnant woman? doctors, nurses, ministers,
social workers, and family planning and abortion counseling
organizations.
They filed this action as a class action, seeking to
represent members of their various classes.
The District Court below found, that the right of
privacy included the right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy,
and that the statute which limited the reasons therefor was
unduly restricted and overly broad,
\

The District Court found that Mary Doe

and her class

N

4
was entitled feo declaratory relief.

Tha positions, even

though they were found to have standing, and other parties,
were said to have insufficient collision of interests.

This

question we brought to this Court also.
This ease stands, on jurisdictional grounds, similar
to the Roe vs. Wade case, which has just been argued, except
that no plaintiff in this case has pending criminal
prosecutions outstanding against them.
It is our position that the jurisdiction of this
Court is much like the case of Wisconsin vs. Consfcanfcine’au,
where, in that case -- the statute in that case operated
against a third party's rights -~
Q

Excuse me.

MRS. HAMESs

These are class actions, too?

Yes, Your Honor, they are.

The statute in Wisconsin vs. Constantineau operated
against a third party's rights, and I am sure you will recall
that was the posting of the alcoholic case.

The criminal

penalty there ran against the bartender who sold •alcoholic
beverages.

So that tha woman —■ the posted party would never

have an opportunity to assert her rights —it was a woman in
the". case’>:

. in the defense of the criminal action against the

bartender.
;

Here we have a like situation of the third party's

rights, Mary Doe, who would nover have an opportunity, we say,
adequately to assert her constitutional rights in the defense

3

of the doctor's criminal prosecution.
Georgia, like Tessas, it is not a crime for a woman
to submit to an abortion or to abort herself.
Q

Could ©he be guilty of a conspiracy to perform

an abortion?
MRS.

HAMESs

I cannot cite you a case expressXy,

but it is my recollection that the Georgia courts have held
that she would not ba so guilty.

Her husband or her paramour

could■—
--_

Q •

Might be.

MRS. H&MES:

— have been charged? but that, to

my recollection, there has not bean a charge brought against
a woman as a conspirator.
Q

Mrs. Harness, the hospital here was not named

as a defendant, was it?
MRS. HAMESs
Q

No, Your Honor, it was not.

Is there a reason for that?

MRS. HAMESs

The hospital was not thought to be an

indispensable party, sinca the hospital abortion committee
was a statutory committee, created by the statute,of the
abortion statute.

It was our opinion that under the Georgia

law, dealing with the Attorney General and his powers, which
gave him powers over all boards, committees, and commissions,
as to matters of law, that this was sufficient to bring that
interest into operation.

6

Also, the abortion committee is a revolving committee,
and it would have involved various doctors from time to time.
Most hospitals in Georgia have their various staff members
sit on the abortion committee, so that it changes from month
to month , or from day to day, even.
So that it was felt that bringing the Attorney
General, the State Attorney General In as the defendant in the
case would be sufficient to reach this State statutory
abortion committee, in the exercise of the statutory authority
given to them.
Mary Doe was a 22-year-old. woman; she was married,
and pregnant at the time this action was filed.

Her reasons

for abortion were several? she had three previous children,
two of whom had been taken from her custody by State
authorities because of her inability to care for them? and
the third she had placed with adoptive parents at birth.
She applied to the public hospital for an abortion,
where she was eligible for free medical care.

Her applica­

tion there was denied. She later applied, through a private
physician, to a private hospital abortion committee, where
her abortion application was approved.
,Her — she did not obtain the abortion, however,
because-she did not have the cash to deposit and pay her
hospital bill in advance.
The Georgia statute is —-

7
Q

Is there a real Mary Dors,, or is this just —

MRS. FAMES:

Yes, Your Honor, there is. And filed

in the original files, which has been sent up to tills Court,
is a sealed affidavit which is signed in Mary Doe's real name.
It was signed and filed with the court originally in the
proceedings.

She was present at the hearing in this case,

and we offered, to have her testify and disclose her identity
and the court did not deem that necessary.
We filed in. the fictitious name to protect her
identity and avoid embarrassment.

But that, original affidavit

is on file in this Court.
Q

I notice in the record that the State has

removed her other three children, or at least two of them,
from her custody because she's unable to care for them.

Was

that over her objections or with her consent, or just no
opposition?
MRS. HAMESs

It was not with her consent, Your Honor,

as I recall? if was for the protection of her children.
Q

But removed under the broad welfare provision?

MRS. HAMESs

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Mr. Chief

Justice.
Our major contention here, our appeal here is
directed primarily at the procedural requirements left standing
by the District Court below.

Our statute- does provide that

rape is grounds for abortion? also fetal malformation and

8
danger to the life of the woman, or serious and permanent
injury to her health.
These were the reasons that the court declared
unconstitutional, finding that there were other good reasons,
good and sufficient reasons for an abortion.
The requirements that are left standing are the
residency requirement, that the woman’s doctor have at least
two consultants, who concur in his opinion, and approval by a
hospital abortion committee* of at least three more doctors.
And the accredited, licensed hospital provision? this
accreditation requirement is by the Joint., Commission on
Hospital Accreditation of Chicago, Illinois, Corporation,
which is a private organisation.
There ware-other many reporting requirements, and
miscellaneous provisions left in the statute? but I wish to
*

direct the Court’s attention to these, the hospital abortion
committee, the accreditation, residency requirement.
It is the appellants’ contention that it’s not
necessary to debate the fetal life problem in this case,
i

because, as the District Court below recognised, this statute
is aimed at protecting--the health -of women.

Judge"smith, in

delivering the opinion of the court, found that the whole thrust
of the present Georgia statute is to treat the problem as a
meSlcal one.
The only compelling State interest, however, that

9
has been asserted by the State, is the interest in preserving
fetal life.

And in taking this approach to the statute,

the State finds itself in a very inconsistent position, we
feel; that is, of claiming that fetuses, from the moment of
conception have the right to develop and be born, and yet,
having abandoned such right, as to those fetuses, the
product, of rape, which may likely be malformed,, or those which
may endanger the life or health of the woman»
Further, the State is in the inconsistent position
of financing a family planning program, which daily distributes
— excuse me?
Q

Under this statute, the fetus that's & product

of rape, may that b® aborted?
MRS» HAMESs

Q

Without more?

MRS• RAMESs
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

I'm sorry?

Without more, whether or not it's involving

health of the mother?
MRS« HAMESs That's correct.

Rape, both forcible

and statutoryi which is girls 13 years and younger in Georgia,
Q

That's by specific provision, 1 gather?

MRS» HAMESs

Yes, that's one of the exceptions.

Our law is modeled after the Model Penal Code, American Law
Institute version.
The further inconsistency involves the financing of

10
the family planning program, which distributes, through the
Department of Public Health, the intra-uterine contraceptive
device, which, substantial medicar opinion shows, destroys
the product, of conception, or prevents implantation of the
fertilised egg or embryo.
We feel that if the State has such an unfettered
interest in fetal life, that these are very inconsistent
positions.
Thus, it is our contention that the statute must be
viewed as a heslth~©£”the-woman directed-purpbse statute.
I would point out that abortion is not a new medical
procedure.

Of course we3ve heard a lot about it in the last

few years.

But it's one that9s been extensively performed

throughout the history of our country, and of course
illegally.
Because of the abortion statutes, the great majority
of abortions have been performed by unskilled persons, those
least equipped to take care of the health problems.
Doctors, because it is a crime, have not been performing
abortions.
Abortion statutes, however, have not stopped the
abortions.

They have not served a purpose, or they have not

are not reaching the purpose of protecting fatal life.
If that is a valid purpose.
To assume that these statutes do protect fetal life

is to ignore fclf; actual facts.

In our brief, and in the many

amici briefs filed in this case, there is extensive citation
to statistics about illegal abortions, and the admission of
patients for aseptic abortions, that is the incomplete
abortions, into our hospitals, which show that illegal
abortions are being performed.
What we're actually talking about is getting abortion
out of the illegal arena into the health service arena,
and this is the purpose of this litigation.
1 would point out that illegal abortion and the
complications therefrom is the largest single cause of
maternal mortality in the United States.

Therefore, abortion

statutes have resulted in one of our nation's largest health
problems.
It is our contention that the procedural requirement
left standing by the court below has virtually manipulated
out of existence the right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy,
as recognised by the Court.
The decision below characterizes the decision to
terminate an unwanted pregnancy as a personal-medical decision.
In commenting about the procedural requirements, the hospital
abortion committee, the limitation to the accredited hospital,
the court said that the State has an interest in the quality
of health care, to be administered to its citizens; but this
is not to imply that the present procedures are the best means

12
of control»

The present seems to be unnecessarily cumbersome

and possibly a due process h&sard.
of the court in a footnote.

This was the observation

And it is cur contention that

these procedures are so cumbersome* costly* and time-consuming
as to have denied Mary Doe and members of her class* and
doctors and members of their class* of their various rights.
Of course, there is an inherent time factor in
pregnancy, and this must be a factor considered.
First trimester abortions are safer than late
abortions.

Therefore, it is imperative that the right to

terminate an unwanted pregnancy be efficiently exercised.
Mortality and complications for late abortions are
three times greater, after 12 weeks? and it is only about the
sixth or the eighth week that pregnancy tests actually become
accurate, or the degree of accuracy is such that can reasonably
predict whether one. is pregnant or not.
So that we actually have about 12 weeks *—
Q

Does the record disclose that?

MRS. HAMES:
0
■

Does the record — I'm sorry?

Does the record disclose that it is medically

<r

established that pregnancy tests are not very accurate until
after six weeks?
MSS. HAKES:

No, Your Honor, we were not permitted to

introduce our evidence at the hearing, that was — we had many
witnesses to testify about the various aspects of abortion and

13
pregnancy.

1 'ia sure that this Court can take judicial

notice of many medical treatises which would disclose that this
is a fact.
Q

Well, I8m asking if it is an established medical

fact?
MRS. HAMES:

Yes, it is my understanding that this is

accepted procedure, that a pregnancy is not easily detectable
until after the sixth week, and accuracy is about at the
eighth week.
The requirement that a physician have two consultants
and then present the case to the abortion committee is
unsuited, and unsuited procedure for medical treatment.
Q

Yet, hasn't it been followed for years in

accredited hospitals?
MRS. HAMES; There are many committees in hospitals?
they have tissue committees, and they have other kinds of
committees.

But these do not make decisions about constitu®*

tional right, and whether or not it will be exercised.
And the hospital abortion committee, being a statutory committee,
is the arm of the State Government, we contend, and would be
different -from a mere fissus committee through which it is
Q

As 1 understood, you were arguing this as being

unduly cumbersome? and my response is:

Is it not a fact that

this has been a routine in accredited hospitals all over the
country for many, many years?

14
MRS» HAMUS:

It is my understanding that the

accreditation standards of the Joint Commission do not require
appointment of abortion or other committees.

This is a

practice that has developed and grown up; and I think it grew
up prior to the American Law Institute, specifically as to
abortion.

And it was to relieve doctors from their

responsibility in making this decision solely.

And they were

afraid of assuming that responsibility because of the criminal
sanctions imposed by law.
Therefore, they had their hospitals constitute
abortion committees, who would help share the responsibility
for such a decision.
The operation of committees of a hospital, of course,
would be an internal matter for hospitals, and it might be
possible that a committee -- that a hospital could continue
to have a committee to govern abortions in that hospital.
However, ites our contention that the right to have
—- to terminate a pregnancy should not be controlled by a
statutory committee from which there is no appeal, where there
is no opportunity for a hearing; the woman is never seen by
the members of the committee, she is never told why her
abortion was denied, and her doctor, many times, is 'sot even
permitted to acme and present her case.
This committee, we feel, is not a vehicle which could
properly determine this constitutional right.

We feel that it

15
is, as the court said below, a medical-personal decision? that
many factors in deciding whether to have an abortion are
personal.

Like your desire to have only two children, or your

family size; your economic status is a matter of personal
knowledge.
This is not a matter that can be effectively
presented to a committee? a doctor could not possibly
present all these matters to a hospital abortion committee.
And we feel that this committee is just an improper vehicle for
determining the right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.
Additionally, there is the problem of the doctor,
and he feels that his patient should have an abortion, she want
an abortion; but he must submit his decision not only to
concurrence of two more consultants, but to the hospital
abortion committee.
These are his competitors, his professional
competitors? they are doctors in his community who decide
what he will do in his medical practice.

It's the position of

the doctors that this infringes their right to practice
medicine in accordance with their best medical judgment.

Xt

permits the committee to substitute their judgment, their
religious or personal views with those of his and the decision
reached between himself and his patient.
Q

Well, that argument would be true about the

maintenance of professional standards generally in the medical

profession, would it not?
everything else»

Disciplinary proceedings, and

Presumably those who pass upon malpractice

or lack of professional competence or ethical judgment on the
part of doctors are his competitors.
MRS. HAMESt

That•s true ? but I would think that he

has some voice in arriving at the standards of his profession,
and that the application of his professional standards would
not be the same as application of his — of the abortion
committee33 on personal views.
I think that these are matters that are better left
to the profession? I would think that the medical profession
can develop its standards.

The American College of Obstetricians

and Gynecologists has taken the policy that where an abortion
is requested by a woman,, and there are no contra-medical
indications, then the abortion will be performed without even
the necessity of a consultant.

Where it is recommended by a

doctor, then the American College recommends that the doctor
have a consultant on that decision.
X think that the profession can develop standards,
and that this is where it should be controlled, rather then by
a hospital abortion committee sitting in a quasi-judicial
situation.
X would point out that the hospital accreditation
requirement limits abortions in Georgia, and denies many rural
woman of access to abortion services? 105 of Georgia’s counties

17
have no accredited hospitals, so that those woman who are
dependent upon their county hospital for prs-medical service
are denied, by virtue of this hospital accreditation require­
ment, their —
Q

How many of those counties have no hospitals at

all?
MRS. HAMES:

There are 284 hospitals, and 1 have not

made a comparison to see*

Abortions have only been performed

in 22 comities in Georgia,
Q

Well, isn't it possible that some of these

counties to which you refer do not have hospitals at all?
MRS» HAMES:

Yes, it is possible, Your Honor, that

some eight or ten of the smaller, less-populated hospitals —
counties could have that situation.
Q

Well, if that's all there are in Georgia, with

the large number of counties you have, I think you have more
counties than any other State, don't you?
MRj^o HAKES :
Q
States»

I believe we do.

You're far better developed than many other

I just question your general statement about denial

of relief, -MRS. HAMES:
Q

One further thing —

— generally as to counties.

MRS. HAMES: Excuse me.
— as to hospitals.

The Hew York experience has

18

shown that abortions in clinics is a relatively safe —» is a
safe procedure.

There the abortions, early abortions, are not

required to be performed in hospitals.

And if we had this

requirement or did not have the limitation to accredited
hospitals in Georgia, then we could have abortion clinics in
the more rural areas.
Q

This Georgia legislation is relatively recent,

isn't it?
MRS. HAMES:
Q

It was adopted in 1968, April of 1968.

May I be clear as to the relief you're asking:

You got a declaratory judgment, declaring that some provisions
of the Georgia statute

are unconstitutional?

MRS. HAMES: That's correct.
Q

And you’re asking a declaratory judgment,

declaring the entire statute unconstitutional?
MRS. HAMES;
Q

And you want us to do that?

MRS. HAMES:
Q

Yes, sir.

Yes, Your Honor.

And then you want us to order and issue an

injunction against all future enforcement statutes, is that it?
MRS. HAMES: That's correct.

Or other application

of the law, meaning by abortion committees of hospitals.
0

And, as X understand it, you are arguing the

constitutional rights of Mary Doe and the physicians here?
MRS. HAMES: That's correct.

19

Q

Em I correct in not detecting any constitutional

argument on behalf of your other plaintiffs, your registered
nurses, your counselors and the rest?
MRS, HEMES: As to the nurses, we would say' that they
still have a controversy or a need for relief, because they,
too, are not permitted to practice their profession,

Of course

they would not.be independently performing abortions but would
fo© assisting doctors.

So that there is.

As to the ministers and other counselors, social
workers who wish to counsel abortions, based — under the
decision below which said that, abortions are obtainable for
any reason, they would not now fear the prosecution under the
conspiracy statutes or the aiding and abetting statutes for
counseling abortions.

There’s no real relief needed here.

We —
Q

Well, relief may be needed, but are you making

a constitutional argument on behalf of the nurses, counselors,
ministers, and what-have“you?
MRS. HEMESs
Honor,

On behalf of the nurses, yes, Your

And as for the counselors, it is our contention that

they had a sufficient collision of interests for the declara­
tory relief to be granted as to them,
Q

As a —

Q

Well, do 1 detect that you’re not making a

constitutional argument v/ith respect to them?

If it' r only

20
a need for declaratory relief* isn’t that a State law matter?
MRS. HAMES:

We occupy a position similar to Taxas,

as to declaratory relief.

We have a statute in Georgia which

says that equity will not interfere in the administration of
criminal laws, or of —* yes, criminal laws.

This has recently

been construed, in 1968, to prohibit a declaratory judgment
in equitable relief as to a criminal statute.
So that there is no alternative to go into State
court for declaratory relief.
And this is the only form in which we contend that
plaintiffs could assert their rights.
Q

Well, I still don’t know whether you’re making

a constitutional argument.
MRS. HAMESs

Yes, we are making a constitutional

argument for everyone in this
0

With respect to all the plaintiffs?

MRS. HAMES: With respect to — including the First
Amendment argument which was made below as to counseling
abortions»
Q

1 didn't get that from your brief, but I'm glad

to be straightened out.
MRS. HAMES:
Q

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mrs. Hamss, just before you sit down, perhaps you

made this clear but it hasn't been made clear to me.

You're

appealing here because, while you want at least a partial

victory by way of a declaratory judgment , you were denied an
injunction and that is what, technically, is giving you a right
to appeal directly to this Courts

the denial of the injunction»

You8re arguing now that you should have — wholly
have had a complete victory on the 'merits, that the entire
statute should have been stricken»

And also that an injunction

should have issued»
and I'ia asking you, in that connection, that second
connection, whether the Georgia authorities had disregarded or
manifested an intent to disregard the Federal District Court6s
declaratory judgment of the invalidity of the substantive part
of this statute?
MRS. HAMESs

No, Mr. Justice, there has bean no

manifestation on ~
Q

You ware here, I think, in the argument of the

previous case ~
MRS. RAMES:
Q

Yes,

— where that was true, apparently, in Texas?

MRS. HAMES:

Yes»

I think the need for injunctive relief arises from
the fact that out of the 24 appellate decisions on abortion in
Georgia, 13 of those have involved doctors.

So that there —

wa have a history of prosecution of doctors in Georgia.
Additionally, the law is continued to be enforced, and
abortions are being denied, for unknown reasons, by the hospital

22
abortion committee.

That presents a very real need for

injunctive relief there.
Q

Do I understand you correctly that no hospital

abortion committee has said, We're denying this because we're
not going to follow the District Court's judgment in this case?
MRS, HAMES;
abortions.

We don51 know why they5re denying the

They sire not required to disclose, and they do not

disclose.
Q

And you said of 24 appellate decisions, 13

involve doctors?
MRS. B'AMES:

Yes, Your Honor.

Mrs. Beasley.

23
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. DOROTHY f. BEASLEY,
OK BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MRS. BEASLEYt

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
The very nut of the argument before this Court and the
issue facing this Court is the value which is to be placed on
fetal life.
The State, in this case, takes the position that
fetal life is to be protected? that it is a protectable interest
Nov;, the question is whether there should be no value
placed on it, so that a woman may, in her own decision and with
her own doctor, determine, without any intervention by the State
that she may. abort a pregnancy after she has conceived and is
carrying a live, human fetus.
Or whether, on the other hand, the State itself may
protect the interests of that fetus in any x*egard.
The court below determined that the State's interest the State was attempting to go too far in protecting fetal life?
but that it could protect it to some degree because it could
prohibit those abortions which were not necessary in the best
clinical judgment of the physician, taking into consideration
not only medical factors but really everything involved in the
particular case;

the woman’s economic position? her family

position, and so on.
But, at any rate, the court did indicate that the

24
State had an interest in protecting fetal life at least to
that extent.
Now, if the court, of course, had said, Well you can
have an abortion in any event, whether it's necessary or not,
than, of course, it would be consistent with the argument that’s
made by the appellant.
However, they said the State does have an opportunity
to control those abortions which are not necessary.

They may

prohibit them, period.
I think a great mistake has bean made by that court,
and by appellants, in saying that the purpose of the statute is
single;

that is, that it is only a health measure.
In the first place, it8 s in the criminal code,

As a

separate bill, it was introduced to amend a. part of the criminal
code.
The original bill, or the original statute, in 1876,
was a criminal action.

And it speaks of the unborn child.

It doesn't speak of a "thing-" or an "organism”,

it speaks

of protecting the unborn child. And that is at least one of
the interests of the Stato in this statute.
I submit that there are three.
statute in its entirety.

If you read the whole

No. 1, and the underlying reason;,

is the protection of fetal life from wanton or arbitrary
destruction simply upon the convenience or the desire of the
woman who is bearing it.

25
Secondly, of course, the State is interested in
protecting women who are going to undergo a vary serious pro­
cedure at any stage, and that is the abortion procedure.
Asid that, of course, is indicated by tbs very serious
procedure that’s set out, by not only having her own physician
think that she could have one, but in getting consultants and
also approval.by the hospital abortion committee,,' and requiring
it to be done in a hospital.

Which, by the way, has certainly

been the position of the American Medical Association in the
House of Delegates in 1967, which was just one year prior to
the time this statute was enacted, and has, in my understanding
at least, been the position of the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists in their standards.
And in their latest standard with regard to abortion,
as X read it, and of course this is rot before the Court, and
1 just make an aside for a moment to say that that's part of
the trouble with this cases

it's a facial attack on the

constitutionality of the statute.

And all of these statistics

and what the doctors think cn one side or on the other, and
whether abortions are safer than childbirth, and so on,
are really not before the Court because they were not introduced
into evidence in the court below.
So they are not part'of the record.
Now, certainly, the appellants tried to present
evidence, and in the only hearing that was held before the

26
lower court, which hearing lasted about two hours, at the most,
there was only argument; but both sides came prepared to
present evidence.
And of course in order to attack the constitutionality
as feo its effect or its operation in Georgia, or its
applicability;, 1 submit that we would need a fuller record;
and that if there is an attack on the face of the statute, it
cannot be supported without looking at these further facts,
unless you can say that the State has no interest whatsoever
in protecting fetal life®
And I think that the interest which the fetus has, as
a human fetus, in this instance becomes broader as time goes
on,
I think the State has a greater obligation to protect
:

that fetal life today than it did in 1876.

And for this reason;

itEs more protectable now than it ever was before.
There are more methods now that can be used to protect
it, including blood transfusions and surgery while it’s still
in the womb.
Now, this, I think, has bean brought to the Court’s
attention in some of the bx-iefs that have been filed by the
physicians.

But, at any rate, there are more possible ways now

— for example, the very growth of the science of fetology,
which is, of course, the treatment of the fetus before it’s
born

27
So its development, it has bean created, and its
development up to the period of birth is such now that it can
be protected by the State, and so I think there is a greater
duty upon the State to do so.
How, the. question which 1 think comes here with
regard to these exceptions is a balancing of competing interests.
The State certainly takes no position that the woman has a
constitutional right to abortion.
We have not been shown where that, right emanates from.
If it emanates frora the considerations which were given in the
griswoljl.ease, I think it's erroneous, because in that case
there was not the introduction of another entity,

A person

has a right to be let alone, certainly; but not when another
person is involved, or another human entity is involved.
The same thing with the marriage relationship.

Here

a third entity is involved, and the State says yoi: may not
indiscriminately dispose of or discontinue the life of that
third entity except in very special circumstances.
How, this is where we get to the competing interest

,

and the balancing of the interest, -which, by the way, 1 think
was the

statement in recognition that former Mr. Justice Clark

made in his Law Review article about the State being in
position to balance competing interests. That is, you have a fetus
growing in a woman on one side, and the woman says she doesn’t
want it, you’ve got a clash of interests there.

Now, the State has taken the positions Well, we5re
not going to prohibit all abortions, because we understand that
there are circumstances in which a woman should be able to
destroy that fetus, because her interest is superior.
And there are three broad reasons now that are given
in our statute, of course, which were struck out by the court
below, so that we can’t here really argue those, although we
attempted to bring an appeal here, which was denied for lack of
jurisdiction; and our appeal now is awaiting its further
pursuit in the Fifth Circuit.
Q

Well, .Mrs. Beasley, I don’t see why you can’t

argue that here.

Your position is that the court was right

in not issising an injunction, and you can support that position
by any argument you want.

You’re the appellee, you’re not

the appellant.
MRS. BEASLEYs

Thank you very much.

[Laughter.3
Underlying the exceptions, the reason for the excep­
tions in the statute, is the broad principle of self-presentation.
We recognize that a human being has the right ultimately of
self-defense.

And 1 think that these exceptions are manifesta­

tions of that.
We allow a woman to abort a fetus if it is the product
of rape.

Now, that has been construed in our State to also

include incest.

29

This is the product,, of course, in that situation,
of an unwarranted, uninvited attack on her.

And to require

her to bear that child is almost a punishment; or at least she
would often regard it as a punishment.

So here she can defend

herself from that fetus by destroying if.
Secondly, as far as a fetus which is gravely mal­
formed and will bs permanently malformed, or deficient, the
State recognises, I think, a very practical exception because
it recognises that in most cases she is the one who is going
to have to raise that child; and the State is not now in the
position t'/here it can automatically take in all of these
children.

And of course it would be a great deal of heartbreak

to her; -and so it would involve her own well-being.

And the

State says, in these circumstances science is not enough
developed so that we can correct these deformities, the State
can't help enough in these circumstances, and therefore we
regard it as an exception and allow you to defend yourself
against the circumstance which would arise if you had to bear
and keep this child.
The third one, of course, is the preservation of her
own life or her own health; and of course it has been construed
— not judicially but as a matter of practice — that health
here includes mental health.

Mow
Q

"■
Did you say that the first one you mentioned,

30
which is the third one* X think, in the statute — pregnancy
resulting from forcible or statutory raps — also includes -~
by construction also includes pregnancy resulting from incest?
MRS.BEASLEY;

Yes,, X did.

And 1 say this only from

an observation of the reports that have been collected by the
Georgia Department of Public Healthf to whom all abortions, of
course, are reported.
That, again, is not in the record because there was
no evidence presented.

However, particularly since the period

of the court decision, the reasons that are reported in by the
physicians that are performing abortions have been expanded,
so that not only have you got rape and incest as separate,
and not only do you hats’© for mental problems or physical
problems that are maternal, you also have economic and social
now being given as a separate category and reason.
So that places it at a point that an injunction is not
needed., also.
Q

Yes, but, incidentally, I gather no court below

said that that9s the correct interpretation of this point?
MRS. BEASLEY;

That’s right.

But no one has brought

the matter to the attention of the Georgia courts.

And I would

dispute —
Q

Well, you say this has happened since this court

decision, though? didn't you?
That’s the ~ so it’s the effect of the decision, is

31
it not?
MRS.BEASLEY: As far as the social and economic *—
Q

Yes.

MRS. BEASLEY %

— is concerned, I think your question

as to the rape or incest is what existed before.

not cer­

tain of that, but I think it would, because the court decision
would make nsj distinction or voiding it, necessarily, in that
regard.
Q

Well, the statute does not mention incest.

MRS. BEASLEYS
Q

That is correct.

But I —

And it clearly does not mention economic or

social: conditions —
MRS, BEASLEYs
Q

Clearly.

and now, if abortions are taking place, based

upon those extra-statutory reasons, I would suppose that this
has begun to happen since this case was decided by the District
Court.

Is that true?
MRS. BEASLEY:

Yes, indeed, it has happened since

then, and I think that9s one of the vary reasons why no
injunction would be necessary.
In the first place, the parties against whom the «—
Q

Well, is that the State thrust, to the extent

the judgment below was affirmed, Georgia accepts it and would
not prosecute under the statute —
MRS. BEASLEY:

Until it's changed, otherwise.

But the

32
State} of course, takes the position that the statute is
constitutional as it was written.
Q

Yes, I know, but my prophesy was if the judgment

below! were to be affirmed»
MRS, BEASLEY:

If the judgment below were to be

affirmed, certainly there is no indication that the State and
the District Attorneys and the hospital abortion committees
would not follow the mandate of this Court, as has been done?
no prosecutions have been brought, despite the fact of the
reporting of these other extra-statutory abortions.
Q

Relying on the judgment below — you reportedly

rely on the judgment below, in these positions, 1 gather —
MRS• BEASLEYs That is correct.
Q

— in performing abortions, relying on the

judgment as permitting abortions?
MRS. EEASLEYs

Yes, indeed.

And so there would b© no purpose for an injunction
because it's being obeyed as a declaratory judgment.
Moreover, an injunction against any one of the
defendant parties would really lead nowhere, because the
L - ‘

Attorney General, of course, is not one to bring prosecutions
in the first place, and has no connection whatsoever with these
hospital abortion committees, despite what the court below
believed.
Another suit, as a matter of fact, was instituted last

33
year against the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority, a body
politic and corporate, doing business as Grady Memorial Hospital»
Now, that's where you get the abortion committee in
the hospital»

And the Attorney General has no idea what the

abortion committee in this particular cases did, or how much
it knew»

And that again is one of the great problems with this

case.
We know of no facts, there are no facts in this case,
no established facts»
Q

Why was it the three-judge court did not permit

the introduction of evidence?
MRS. BEASLEY:

The court apparently believed that it

was not necessary, because they were going to consider it as
a facial attack only.

And I think the court made a mistake

in that circumstance.

I think they confused these two things:

one, whether.you need facts to establish a justiciable
controversy? and,two, whether you need facts and a concrete
circumstance in order to decide facial unconstitutionality»
And I think they jumped to the second situation, and
said, Well, we're going to just look at that statute anyway,
so the facts don't matter.
And I would submit that that's a wrong circumstance,
even the -~
Q
or controversy?

Are you ~~ do you say there was or wasn't a case

34
MRSo BEASLEY:

I say there was not.

There was not a

The Attorney General, the District Attorney of Pulton
County, and the chief of police of the City of Atlanta
had no. case or controversy whatsoever with Mary Doe or any of
the doctors or nurses or organizations or ministers or
counselors.
Q

Well, say a parson allegas that she is pregnant

MRS. BEASLEY:

I think the controversy is with the —»

committee.

That is, it may have been the

1 think that that would have to —- they would have

to be an important party.
Q

Let's assume, though, that there is — that

their refusal to abort is wholly consistent with the law, and
that the refusal was precisely what the law required them to
do.

Then who is the controversy with?
MRS. BEASLEYs

I think you would indeed have a case

or controversy there.
Q

' With the Attorney General?

MRS. BEASLEY:

Ho, sir, not with the Attorney General?

with those who are implementing the law.

The Attorney

General would be interested and would undoubtedly — as
required by law, he would file, a brief.
Q

If a doctor refuses an abortion because he's

35
afraid of criminal prosecution, I suppose one effective way to
resolve the controversy is to enjoin the person who might
prosecute.
MRS. BEASLEY: And that's not the Attorney General»
Q

Who is it?

MRS. BEASLEY:
G

It would be the District Attorney.

He's one of the appellees here?

MRS. BEASLEY:

Yes, he is one of the appellees,

Mr. Justice Douglas.
Q

So is the chief of police.

MRS. BEASLEY:

That is indeed correct.

Of course the

chief of police would not bring the prosecution, and there were
no prosecutions or threats -Q-

Well, I know, but isn't there a case or

controversy/— if a woman had been refused an abortion, and
because a doctor is afraid of being prosecuted, don't you have
a controversy with the law enforcement officers who are
enforcing the law?
MRS. BEASLEY:

Yes, you may? but there was no enforce”

ment here which was threatened or impending.
Q

Well; but it was conduct pursuant to the law,

though, mainly in the refusal of an abortion —
MRS. BEASLEY; But we don't know that it was pursuant
to the law.

You're assuming, I believe, another circumstance:

that there was compliance with the law.

That's what the State

Q

What did the complaint allege?

MRS, BEASLEYs

It alleged feh.iit that was the reason,

but, again, they also stated that they didn't know.

When do you decide standing, after a trial or

on the face of a complaint?
MRS® BEASLEYs

question.

When do you decide standing, after a trial?

MRS® BEASLEY?

AFTERNOON SESSION

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

You may proceed, Mrs.

Beasley.
MRS. BEASLEY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

We were speaking, I think, when we stopped about case
or controversy.

And I think that it's very clear that a case

or controversy would exist with a hospital or hospital abortion
committee in all of the constitutional questions which are
sought, to be raised and argued in this case put before it there.
I think, also, that
Q

I suppose if your requirement was satisfied,

and they would show the threat, you would then conclude it would
be beyond the competence of the three-judge court to enter a
decree?
MRS. BEASLEY:

That's correct.

If there were that.

But here we have no case or controversy, and the threat of
course would involve the anti-injunction statute, I think,
rather than whether it could be —
Q

Well, a threat would make it a case or

controversy.
MRS. BEASLEY:
Q

A threat might.

Yes.

MRS. BEASLEY:

If the proper parties were involved.

But here, for example, we don't have — as far as we know, we

38

don't have Mary Doe's doctor, someone who is taking any action?
and even in the cases which the Court recently has considered,
about the facial constitutionality of some criminal statutes,
there was an actual case or controversy ♦— not even with regard
to the —
0

Well, Mary Doe's real, isn't she?

MRS. BEASLEY;
Q

1 thought it was conceded that she was.

MRS. BEASLEY;
at all.

I don't know.

No, sir.

We know no facts about her

We assume that sines there is an affidavit concerning

it, that those facts may very well be true; but we have had

no opportunity to see whether there are other facts.
Q

Did the -- as I remember,your colleague on the

other side answered that there was an offer of proof to the
District Court, that she was real, and that he said that wasn't
necessary.
MRS. BEASLEY;
Q

That is correct.

That means he accepted.

Did he accept the fact

that this was a real human being, a person?
MRS. BEASLEY; The court below accepted, as far as I
know, the statements that were mad® in allegation as being
true.

So that no proof was submitted, no interrogatories were

answered; we had no opportunity to find out.
*

Q

But it was "" but the plaintiff expressed a

willingness and. did offer to show this; is that correct?

39
MRSo BEASLEYs
Q

Yes.

MRS, BEASLEYs
Q

Yes, through counsel,

That is correct.

X understand she was in the courtroom.

MRS. BEASLEY;

That is what counsel informs us is

correct, but she was not pointed out; she didn’t stand up' in
court, for example, and indicate herself to the court.
just understand that she was there.

But we

We don’t know who she was,

there was a courtroom full of people.
So that we couldn’t follow up, you see, in any way.
0

Yes.

Q

Once it's accepted, what difference does if make

to the case, if any?
MRS. BEASLEY:
0

Pardon?

I’m sorry.

Once that’s accepted as a fact, why will that

make any difference to the case?
MRS. BEASLEY:
0

If her allegations are accepted?

If the proffer, if the court says the proffer of

proof was unnecessary, then why do we need be concerned about
whether she is a fictitious or a real person?
MRS. BEASLEY: Because it was not a complete divulgence
of the facts surrounding her circumstance.

For example, we

don’t know that the hospital abortion committee knew as much
about her as in her allegation.

We don’t know the real reason

for which they denied her the abortion.

Particularly since she

40
was, assertedly, granted the approval of another hospital
abortion committee? which, again, makes her situation somewhat
moot»

Because she did receive —
Q

If you should lose on your point that there's no

case or controversy, do you concede that the remedy given was
proper?
MRS. BEASLEY;

No, sir.

Mr. Justice Douglas, we

think that the statute itself, in tot©, does not render any
lack of due process or equal protection on its face, to any
of these plaintiffs or anyone else.

We think that the statute

is a constitutional one as written.
Q

Suppose you lose on that, do you think the remedy

ae given was improper?
MRS. BEASLEY;

If this Court, decides that the

restrictions that were made on the statute are correct, and a
declaratory judgment should issue, we would think that would
indeed be proper? and that an injunction would not be necessary.
Q

Do you think an injunction would be proper in

light of 1983?
MRS. BEASLEY;
!

We think not, because we find no

necessity, and of course an injunction is an extraordir^ry
legal relief.

Injunction against any one of these appellees

would do nothing, as far as the enforcement, that isn®t already
being dona, as far as the statute is concerned,
Q

But you would construe the word "inequity” in

41
1983 as allowing an injunction?
MRS. BEASLEY:

In some cases?

There may be a situation in which an

injunction would be appropriates but not in this circumstance,
where there is no — well, if the Court considers that there is
a case or controversy, there still would not be a need for an
injunction? of course, an injunction being a discretionary
type of thing.

And the court below finding no necessity for

one, we think that was a correct finding by the court.

And so

there should be no necessity for this Court to direct —
Q

So a declaratory decree would be. proper under

1983?
MRS. BEASLEY:
0

Yes, sir.

And then, of course, I suppose the Court could,

in the interest of effectuating its declaratory judgment, at
some later time issue an injunction; couldn't it?
MRS. BEASLEY:
Q

Yes, sir.

If it became necessary.

That would be if there were indications that the

declaratory judgment were not being otherwise obeyed or
effectuated.
MRS. BEASLEY:

Yes, indeed.

I think that there would

be a continuing opportunity to do so.
Q

Fine.

We don't have here, Mrs. Beasley, do we,

any question of the application of 2283?
State
MRS. BEASLEY:

MRS. BEASLEY;
Q

Mo.

Civil or criminal?

MRS. BEASLEY %

No, Mr. Justice Stewart, there were

no *— nothing at all, as far as that's concerned, not even a
threat.

And I think that’s one of the things that makes it

so different from the Wigconsin vs. Constantinaau case, where
there was something actually done? it was conduct there.
Q

Right.

MRS. BEASLEY:

Taken on behalf of the officials of

the State, in that case the chief of police, I believe it
was.
Q

Right»

MRS. BEASLEY; Which we don’t have here at all.
I would like to point out one other thing, though, we
were --- X was mentioning to the Court the purposes of the
statute.

I think, one of the other purposes of it — I think

there are primarily three — being to protect fetal life and
of course the health of the mother, in having to go through
this procedure, and also to protect doctors who are going to
perform therapeutic abortions.

The procedure is set cut and

they’re protected if they stay within those wide protections
that are given in the statute, the procedure that’s given,
the District Attorney has no basis on which to prefer an
indictment against them? and of course the burden would be on

him to show that the abortion was not necessary.
So I think the statute is also to protect the
doctors so that they can operate with regard to therapeutic
abortions.
Q

Well, isn't the doctor already protected — you

don’t have any criminal prosecution for any other operation, do
you?
MRS. BEASLEYs That‘s correct.
Q

In Georgia?

You don’t, do you?
MRS. BEASLEY;
Q

No, it does not? not that I know of.

Then why do they need that protection on

abortions?
MRS. BEASLEY; Because abortions —,
Q

Because the abortion statute is there.
\

MRS. BEASLEYs
Q

That’s right.

Thats s what I thought.

MRS. BEASLEYs. One other point I would like to make,
and that is this:

In another area the State does recognise

fetal life as being human lifft, and that is with regard to fetal
death certificates, which are required to be filed when there is
a fetal death.
In that portion of the statute which deals with
funeral arrangements and so on, vital records, the distinction
is made between live birth and fetal death.

Live birth is

regarded as a situation where a product of conception, at
whatever stage it occurs, is expelled or extracted from

a

■

mother’s womb, and there is evidence of life; which means -- and
some examples are given in the statute — voluntary muscle
movement or heartbeat, or something that indicates breathing
or movement, some independent activity in that fetal life.
And that's regarded as a live birth.
A fetal death is regarded as that type of extraction
where there is no evidence of life.
So I think in that instance, too, the State carries
forward the consistent concept and attitude towards pre~birth
children, in that they are indeed human life that needs to be
recorded, and that should be very carefully watched before
there is any destruction of it,
I think that',

in closing, I would like to just say

that we look at a criminal defendant and say, before he is

i

going to be condemned, his guilt must be proved beyond a
reasonable doubt.

Now, we look at an unborn child and say,

Can we not at least limit the destruction of his life to these
certain circumstances, or is ha, as an innocent human life,
allowed to be extinguished without any regard whats©9V@r?
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

something that you want to cover.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MRS. MARGIE PITTS HAMES,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MRS. HAMES:

Just a few things, Mr. Chief Justice.

All of the defendants in this ease did file, a motion
to dismiss, which the court treated as a motion for summary
judgment; and the judgment of the court specifies that at page
87 of the Appendix,
We have not designated a constitutional basis for
our case, but I would like to say that it is

we contend that

the procedural requireraents infringe due process and equal
protection, and that the right..of privacy, as enunciated in
Griswold, of course, is our basic reliance.
I would commend to the Court the article of Professor
Means also, which goes into the abortion — criminal law
common law of abortion; and point out that in Georgia abortion
before quickening was only a misdemeanor, beginning in 1876,
and prior to that time it was no crime at all.
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
MR-. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mrs, Karnes.

The base is submitted.
[Whereupon, at 1:10 p.m., the case was submitted.]
