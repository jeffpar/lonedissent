MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 60, Superintendent of Insurance of the State of
New York against the Bankers Life and Casualty.
Mr. Bauman, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARNOLD BAUMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BAUMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case appears in this Court as a result of a
grant of certiorari to review the affirmance of judgments by
the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed a motion of
the District Court dismissing the complaint in this case, on
the basis that the complaint did not presume an instance of
federal jurisdiction under Rule 17 of the Securities Act of
1933 or Rule 10 — I beg pardon, Section 10 and Rule 10b~5
of the Security Act of 1934.
As I am certain the Court is av/are, I shall say
merely very briefly that Section 17(a) of the '33 Act deals
with the uses of interstate facilities of interstate commerce
in connection with stock frauds involved in the purchase of
securities.
Section 10(b), which is reproduced at page 3 of our
brief, as well as Rule 10b-5, was later passed a year later,
and I respectfully urge upon the Court that it was passed to

4
cover the loopholes, to make up for the loopholes which
Congress left when it passed Section 17{a) of the 1933 Act,
Now, I should like merely to refer to one part of
Section 10(b), because it is at the crux and the center of the
argument that I intend to make.
Section 10, of course, states that:
It shall be unlawful for any one, ,.» by the use
of means of interstate commerce, to use or employ any deceptive
device -— and of course I am leaving out irrelevant words ■—
in contravention of such rules and regulations as the
Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the
public interest or ■— or — and I shall come to the reason for
that emphasis — for the protection of investors,
I think I can say now, before I discuss the facts
with the Court that the reason I stress the "or" in Rule 10b~5
is because I respectfully submit that the court below, both
courts below, Judge Herlands in the District Court, and the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, both
tended to read the protection — the words "in the public
interest" as synonymous with the protection of investors.
And I respectfully submit to this Court that when the rule
was promulgated the Exchange had in mind — I beg your pardon.
When that section was passed, Congress had in mind
a different test for that which is alleged to have been in the
public interest from that which is necessary for the protection

5

of investors.
Q

Mr. Bauman.

MR. BAUMAN:
Q

Yes, sir?

Isn’t there an issue in this case as to in

connection with the purchase or sale of securities?
MR. BAUMAN:
coming to that.

Your Honor, I was just, at this moment,

I was about to say that Rule 10b-5 presents

or gives rise to the second or another one of the issues in
this case in that it, in effect, paraphrases Section 17(a),
but then adds — as Mr. Justice Erennan has called to my
attention — in its very last irords that it prohibits unlawful
actions in connection with the purchase or sale of any
security.
Now, the Court of Appeals — and I should like to use
part of my time to discuss the facts with the Court, because I
think they're very important in this case.

But, in order to

put it in focus, I would like to submit that the Court of
Appeals felt that where a securities transaction is pure in
itself — in other words, securities worth X dollars are sold
for X dollars — even though that is part of and.an integral
part, indeed an absolutely necessary part, of an over-all
fraudulent scheme, the fact that neither the securities trans­
action was impure nor were the processes of the marketplace
sullied, to use the words of the opinion below,

that in such

a case, as long as the securities transaction is pure, the

6

court below felt that it was not "in connection with" a
securities transaction,
Now, with the Court's permission, I should like to
address myself to the facts of this case, because, as I say,
in my view they are that important.
I should say at the very first that I appear as a
representative of the Superintendent of Insurance of the State
of New York, who, as a result of the transactions which I am
about to relate, was appointed liquidator of Manhattan Casualty
Company, a New York insurance company, and of course the
liquidator was appointed by the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, and functions under an order of such appointment.
Until January 24, 1962, Bankers Life was the sole
stockholder of Manhattan Casualty Corporation.

On that day

Bankers sold its Manhattan stock to a group consisting of a
man named Bourne and another man named Begole, who had no
money at all, as it will come out in a moment, for $5 million 1
It had previously been arranged with the Irving
Trust Company that at the closing of this Manhattan stock,
Irving would appear with a check for $5 million.

And at the

closing, at the sale from Bankers Life to Bourne and Begole,
a representative, an officer of Irving Trust did in fact
appear with a check made out in the sum of $5 million payable
to Bankers Life.
This was delivered at the closing.

7
I should point out that at this point in time, and
indeed to the best of my knowledge,, until after the close of
business on January 24th* 1962, Manhattan Casualty had no
account at Irving.

Nonetheless, Irving did issue this check of

5 million to Bankers Life, obviously to pay for the stock which
was being transferred.
Shortly after the closing of this stock, a new board
was elected, and the board convened.
Q

A new bo&rd of Manhattan?

MR. BAUMAN:

Yes, sir.

— and the board convened.

It was represented — and

I believe the record best indicates that it was represented at
that meeting by the chairman of the board, new board of
Manhattan, the man Begole, to whom I previously made reference
as a purchaser — that Manhattan's portfolio of government
securities, U. S. Government bonds and securities, totaling
some $4,854,000, was an undesirable investment from the point
of view of the corporation, and recommended to the board of
directors that in order to better the corporate position these
bonds should be sold and the money invested in a Certificate
of Deposit.
The board of directors, believing that the sale of
its portfolio of government securities totaling almost some
$5 million was so going to be altered, voted a resolution,
relying on the misrepresentations of the chairman, authorizing

8
the sale of the portfolio of Manhattan government bonds»
They ware rapidly sold --Q

Is this — how were-they sold? Did they use some

instrumentality of the Stock Exchange or of interstate
commerce?
MR. BAUMANs

I’m not

they were sold to Second

District Securities, and I'm not certain whether or not, in
that sale, an instrumentality of the Stock Exchange was used.
I do not believe so.
Q

Well, what is the basis for federal — what is

the utilization of the Stock Exchange, or of —- doesn't the
section require that?
MR. BAUMAN:

No, sir, it does not.

Under Section 10

and Rule 10b-5, it is not required that, securities sold be
either listed or unlisted or --Q

I know, but it says "by use of any means or

instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails."
MR. BAUMAN:

Well, I think the reason we are here

has not to do alone with the sale of those securities, but the
fact that payment, a check in the sum of $5 million, the payment
to Bankers Life was in fact mailed to Chicago, the home office
of Bankers Life.
Q

That's the -- well, I know that is not an issue

in the case, but I was just curious to know what really
triggered the federal jurisdiction.

9

MR. BAUMAN;

I just verified my own recollection.

These securities were not sold.

The $4,853,000 worth of

Manhattan bonds were not sold on the Stock Exchange.
Q

Weil, isn't the sale of the securities, though,

the sole basis on \*hich the Second Circuit — isn't that the
sole basis that the government claimed that this transaction
is within the reach of 10(b)?
MR. BAUMAN;

Does Your Honor mean Mr. North, the SEC

representative?
Q

Well, I'll ask you;

how about you?

Is it

your position that —
r

MR. BAUMAN;

My position, Your Honor, is this;

that

there were two securities transactions, and in connection with
either one of them this Court — federal jurisdiction was
properly invoked.
In the first instance, you had the sale of Manhattan's
securities — I beg pardon; the sale of the stock of Manhattan
from Bankers Life to Bourne and Begole.

That's securities

transaction No. 1, and under Section 10 does not have to
involve listed securities.
Q

I know, but it has to, nevertheless, involve

the use of some instrumentality of interstate commerce.
MR. BAUMAN;

Well, in connection with jurisdiction,

as I say, although it does not appear as an issue here, I
will -

10

Q

The $5 million Irving check was mailed to

Chicago.
MR. BAUMAN:

Exactly.

In payment of those very

securities.
Q

Right.

MR. BAUMAN:
Q

In payment of the Manhattan stock, was it?

MR. BAUMAN:
Q

Now, --

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Incidentally, Mr. Bauman, how did Irving

Trust happen to finance these two impecunious chaps with $5
million?
MR. BAUMAN:

Well, there's a man in this case whose

name is Garvin, and Mr. Garvin was a note broker and dealt —
a member of the firm of Garvin, Bantel, also a defendant; and
apparently a large dealer in certificates of deposit, and
basically a note broker and a stock broker.
In some manner, Bourne and Begole —■ Bourne was a
similar fellow from Boston; Bourne got together with Garvin.
And we contend, the Superintendent of Insurance contends that
Garvin arranged —■ indeed, it is absolutely provable ■— that
Garvin arranged with Irving Trust to show up at the closing
of the Manhattan stock with a check for $5 million.

And

Garvin —
Q

And this makes Garvin the credit.

MR. BAUMAN:

Sir — and Garvin likewise arranged the

11

afternoon transactions which — as I will com® to in a moment
— were designed to cover up what had happened in the morning.
Now, I started to respond to Mr. Justice White's
question; if I might, Mr. Chief Justice, I should like to com®
back to that.
I have indicated to the Court that the Superintendent
of Insurance contends that there are two securities trans­
actions here, and we rely, as a matter of fact, on both of them.
We think that the Court of Appeals was wrong when it said that
"we will not-

reach the question in connection with the sale

of the Manhattan securities, as to whether or not this is in
connection with, because as to those securities you, not being
either a buyer nor a seller, don't have standing."
So, as to that transaction, they never did get to the
question.

Although I might point out that Judge Hays> who

dissented in the Court of Appeals, 'dissented without talking
about standing, but simply said these transactions were
obviously at the corner of a fraud, and I dissent.
As to the sale of the government securities, the
Court of Appeals fragmented the fact situation here, did not
look at the actual fraud but said, as I indicated to the Court
before, that since the stock transaction itself was .pur©, since
value was received by the company, and true value, for these
government bonds, all you have here is a misappropriation of
proceeds of the sale? it's corporate mismanagement, it's

12

corporate waste, and we don't feel that that's appropriate
under Rule 10b-5,
So, it is in connection with those two transactions
that I press upon the Court the view that -- and I'll com© to
this a little later — that Birnbaum, which is the principal
case, on the question of the buyer-seller status, under Rule
10b-5, it being a Second Circuit case in which Augustus Hand
wrote the opinion many years ago — I shall urge upon the
Court that in connection with Rule 10b-5 the limitation of th©
buyer-seller rule of Birnbaum is an artificial limitation,
and while I would understand that an expansion of it might
somewhat increase federal litigation, I respectfully suggest
that, speaking only as a representative of creditors, that
whether or not the Court wishes to extend 10b-5 beyond buyer
and seller, I respectfully suggest that there should be a
third category beyond buyer and seller, namely, that a
/

representative of creditors.
Because, certainly, when one talks about making
regulations "in the public interest" or "in the interest of
investors", it seems to me that the Congress had to be talking
about creditors and the representatives of creditors.
Indeed, in the brief we cite the cases, the most
recent one of which is -Bailee and going back to Hooper, which
is th® landmark case, of the Fifth Circuit, which has dealt
with this problem over and over and over again; and I

13

respectfully suggest that a reading of those cases will show
that it has consistently permitted a representative of
creditors, a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver, a person like
the liquidator, who presumably does precisely the same thing
as those gentlemen do, except that because it's an insurance
company it's governed by State lav/s.
And so I would suggest that Birnbaum should be
extended to include such a parson in the interest of the
creditors, which, I suggest, are in the interest —
Q

Well, let me see, you are suggesting

that the

representative of creditors stands in the shoes of the seller,
to bring it within a sale, or what?
MR. BAUMAN:
Q

I — with regard —

The seller, on the transaction selling the

federal bonds.
MR. BAUMAN:
Q

They were sold by Manhattan.

MR. BAUMAN:
Q

Yes.

That's precisely —

And you're suggesting that the representative of

the creditors of Manhattan should be allowed to stand in the
shoes, for the purpose of satisfying the requirement of the
sals; is that it?
MR. BAUMAN:

That's precisely what I'm suggesting.

And I suggest that because when a person is designated in such
a capacity, be he a superintendent, a liquidator, a receiver,

14
or whatever, he is there.

His .interests are varied and many.

His interests are to see that the — that all creditors, all
people involved with the corporation, that the corporation
discharges its obligations to any and all people to whom it
owes obligations.
Q

Who are the creditors of Manhattan at present?

MR. BAUMANs

The creditors of Manhattan at the

present time, Your Honor, are mostly policyholders, people
with claims against Manhattan, Manhattan Casualty.
Q

Well, that’s what creditors are, people with

claims against you.
MR. BAUMAN:

Who are they, precisely?
They’re the public.

They’re the

insured public.
Q

Is there any indication in any of these

pleadings as to who they are, or that their claims have been
unsatisfied, or that they are —
MR. BAUMAN:
to that.

There is a reference in the reply brief

A short reference in th«5 reply brief to the fact

that there are claims outstanding and that, as damages, if w@
ever get to the trial, that we will prove those damages at
the trial; and they will be, among other things, the claims
of creditors, sir.
Now, I want to come back, if J. may, to the events
of that January 24th afternoon.

Because we are now at the

situation where, through fraudulently induced representation

/

15

of the board, the board has authorized the sale of Manhattan’s
government securities? they have now been sold? the proceeds
have been put into the Irving Trust Company, which issued the
first $5 million check; and, in addition, Manhattan sends over
enough money — I think it's $150,000 in cash — to cover the
difference between 4,854,500 —
Q

That also came out of Manhattan's

MR. BAUMAN;
Q

assets?

Yes, sir.

That 150 also?

MR. BAUMAN;

Yes, sir.

And so, now Irving has been fully repaid for the
$5 million check.

It's whole.

Howevtar, at this point in time, may it please the
Court, Manhattan was minus $5 million and is vary near",

if

not actually insolvent, in a regulated industry, one in which
the Superintendent of Insurance regularly visits and inspects.
So, in order to make this scheme good, one had to
come up with a scheme to create a paper asset which would
take the place on the Manhattan balance sheet of the $5 million of
which the corporation had been looted.
Now, what happened there?

Mr. Bourne — I beg your

pardon, Mr. Garvin then arranged an afternoon check swap.
Most of these transactions I’ve told you about, until now,
occurred in the morning.
In the afternoon, a representative of the Irving

Trust Company shows up at Belgian-American Bank and BelgianAmerican Trust — that's really two entities, but one
organization, and I shall refer to them as Belgian-American
Bank

and this representative has a second check for $5

million.
Whereupon, Belgian-American Trust Company issues a
Certificate of Deposit in the name of Manhattan Casualty
Company for $5 million.

This is endorsed by the conspirators,

and a so-called loan is arranged with Belgian-American Banking
to one of Bourne's companies, called New England Note, for
$5 million.

The Belgian-American Trust CD, which was paid, for

with Irving Trust Company money, is used as collateral for the
$5 million loan to New England Note.
The proceeds of the so-called New England Note loan
are then immediately delivered to Irving Trust's representative,
so ha came with a check for $5 million and went back with a
check for $5 million; and, once again, Irving Trust was whole.
Now, where were we at at that point?

At this point,

now, Manhattan is out $5 million, it carries the Belgian Trust
Certificate of Deposit, even though it’s hypothecated as cash
on its balance sheet.
Q

Doesn't reveal the hypothecation?

MR. BAUMAN:
any way.

Does not reveal the hypothecation in

It carries that $5 million — plain old fraud,

because there isn't any $5 million.

17
Q

Fraud on who?

MR. BAUMAN;
Q

Fraud on Manhattan Casualty, sir.

Who was defrauded?

This is a case, it seems to

me, where a fellow took over a corporation and looted it.
was the sole owner.
MR. BAUMAN:

He

And so who was defrauded?
The people who were defrauded are the

public who have 7-figure claims against this corporation.
The people who were defrauded — if the corporation, sir, is
an entity at all, if the corporation is an entity, I would
respectfully suggest to you that because it showed $5 million
in assets it didn't have on its balance sheet, it is perfectly
conceivable to me that people relied on that balance sheet,
people outside the company, and those are the people we're
talking about as the public.
The people who wrote policies, the people who have
claims against the company; and those are the people with whom
I am concerned her©.
So that, at the end of January 24th, Manhattan was
out 5 million, Mr. Bourne and Begole had the stock for nothing;
there was a fraudulent asset on the books.

And, as time went

on, of course •—
Q

Now, are you going to tell us what instrumentality

of interstate commerce was used in connection now with this
second transaction, the sale of the bonds and the $5 million
checks and all the other stuff?

18

MR. BAUMAN:
this:

Well? the — my answer to you, sir, is

It is my contention that all of these transactions to

which I have alluded were part of one over-all scheme.
Q

And are these all hooked to that mailing of

the initial $5 check of Irving’s to Chicago?
MR. BAUMAN:
Q

Yes, sir; that's right.

Well, the Court of Appeals, though, said they

were wholly separate transactions, not tied together.

I know

you don't agree with them.
MR. BAUMAN:

I know the Court of Appeals may have

said that, but it seems to me —
Q

But let's assume they were right in that.

Then where is the federal jurisdiction?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think we'll let you

answer Justice White after lunch, Mr. Bauman.
MR. BAUMAN:

Yes, sir.

[Whereupon, at 12:00 noon, the Court was recessed,
to reconvene at 1:00 p.m., the same day.]

19

AFTERNOON SESSION
[1:00 p.m.3
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bauman, you were

about to answer Mr. Justice White.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARNOLD BAUMAN, ESQ. [Resumed]
MR. BAUMAN:

Yes, sir.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I am sure you are better

prepared to answer him now.
MR. BAUMAN:

That I am, and I appreciate the oppor­

tunity to prepare for that.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Justice White, and members
of the Court, throughout the years of this litigation that
question has never arisen, but the answer is perfectly obvious,
and I shall give it.
In connection with the sale of all the securities,
there were innumerable confirmations sent through the mails?
in connection with the sale of the $4,854,000 of U. S. Govern­
ment securities, there were confirmations sent through the
mails; in connection with the sale of those securities, there
ware telephone calls made, using instrumentalities that give
jurisdiction pursuant to the Securities law.
Q

I was just wondering what it was.

MR. BAUMAN:

Well, that’s it, sir, and I’m sorry I

wasn’t better equipped to answer your question before the
luncheon recess.

20

Q

It was one of those so obvious that you didn't

see it right away.
MR. BAUMAN;

Absolutely

right, sir.

I want to vise my remaining time, also perhaps to
clear up an earlier answer I made to Mr. Justice Brennan.
I want to make clear tc the Court, if I may, that so
far as the U. S. Government securities are concerned, the
$4,854,000^ we feel that we have met every single element of
10b-5, and we think that the elements of 10b-5 are as follows;
One, that the board of directors was deceived.
Two, that $4,800,000 worth of Manhattan's securities
were sold as a direct result of that deception.
Three, the corporation gave up $5 million in
securities and got nothing.
Now, both Judge Herlands in the District Court and,
I believe, the United States Circuit Court for the Second
Circuit held that as to that transaction, and that series of
transactions, there was no question of my standing to sue,
or the liquidator standing to sue; because Manhattan was, in
fact, the seller of securities.

It was in connection with the

transaction involving the sale of the Manhattan shares between
Bankers Life and the buyers that they invoked the Birnbaum
doctrine.
And again I want to say that the fragmentation of
this one over-all scheme, which had as its sole purpose the

21

looting of the company of $5 million? without the sal® of
securities it could not possibly hav® happened,, is where I
part company from the Second Circuit.
Q

The board of directors was deceived by the sole

stockholder?
MR. BAUMAN:
Q

Yes.

And the directors were therefore his representa­

tives, just managing the company that he fully and wholly
owned; is that right?
MR. BAUMAN:
elected them.
Q

Yes.

Well, he was the sole stockholder; he
But when the court says --

I mean, directors generally represent the stock­

holders of a corporation.
MR. BAUMAN:

Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, it seems to

me that,while he may be elected by the stockholders, he has
certain public responsibilities as well as, indeed if he has
many, to the person who elected him.

It seems to me that

there are penal statutes — I beg pardon; I withdraw the word
"penal”.

There are statutes which impose responsibility,

financial responsibility for acts of directors, beyond his
obligations to the person or persons who elected him.
I do say that — and the point I do want to stress
again, is that if the corporate entity has any meaning at all,
it has got to be separate and apart from both its stockholders
and directors.

And where, as here, a liquidator or receiver

22

stands in the shoes of the corporation, as opposed to the
individual who may own the corporation, he has, or should have,
the right to assert public claims involved in the responsibil­
ities of the corporation to the public.
Q

So your position would be the same if all the

directors were co-conspirators with the sole stockholder?
MR. BAUMAN:

Yes, Mr. Justice White, it would be;

yes.
Q

So that even if they didn't — he didn’t

deceive them at all, he deceived the corporation?
MR. BAUMAN:
Q

That's correct.

That's correct.

Whom did he deceive; assuming Mr. Justice

White's hypothesis that the directors and the sole stockholder
all had full knowledge of this looting, then who would have
been deceived?
MR. BAUMAN:

The public, who would have relied on

the statement of Manhattan's assets.
Q

Its balance sheet?

MR. BAUMAN:

Yes, sir.

But I do hasten to assure

the Court, if I may, that that is not the situation in this
case.
The beard was not fully in on this.

As a matter of

fact, the board was deceived, and I hope the Court will forgive
me for emphasizing that; I merely attempted to reply to Mr.
Justice White's question, which is argued in our brief.

23
There is one other point I want to mention quickly,
because I notice I have a very short time to go, and that is
there is a citing relied upon by my adversaries, the case of
Field against Lew, which is a District Court case, in the
Eastern District of New York, written by Judge Zavatt.
That was a case involving a common-law conversion,
it was a case in which, because there was a common-law
conversion and a sole stockholder was the one who caused it,
Judge Zavatt felt that he had ratified the fraud and therefore
there was no cause of action.
I merely want to specify that that case, which is
relied upon by my adversaries, differs so strongly from this
fact situation, because, for one thing, that case dealt with
the State common law of conversion, it did not attempt to
interpret 10b-5, and there were no allegations of deceit on
the board of directors of that corporation.
The factual situation is entirely different, it is
not based on the statute that we are here to discuss, and,
indeed, I respectfully refer the Court to the opinion in
Bailes in the Fifth Circuit, which is cited in the brief,
and which comes out exactly on the opposite side of this
question of "does knowledge by all the stockholders
constitute ratification".
Thank you vary much.
Q

I take it there is a deceit action pending, is

24

there not?
MR. BAUMAN:

Yes, sir.

May I be permitted one sentence in addition to that?
Q

I would like to have it, yes.

MR. BAUMAN:

The mere fact, and this is dealt with

in the brief, Mr. Justice Blackmun, is that -- is if in fact
there is a State remedy, that, as we cited and discussed, in
the brief, does not oust us of federal jurisdiction if in fact
we do fall within Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.
In other words, Your Honor will find in the cases,
particularly in the Fifth Circuit, the repeated statement —
and in other Circuits —* the fact that there may exist a State
remedy in no ways affects the federal remedy.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr. Bauman.

Mr. North.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER P. NORTH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE S.E.C., AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. NORTH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Courts
The Commission is grateful for the opportunity to
participate in this argument before you today.

You have, on

many occasions, permitted us to file amicus briefs, but
participation in the argument;-, means even more to us and I will
try to make good use of the time you've awarded us.
I'd like to start in substantially where counsel for

25

the petitioner left off, on this question of fragmentation,
which is, to my way of thinking, the thing that caused the
court below to go wrong and is the point at which the arguments
now made by the opposition in support of that result is also
erroneous„
On pages 2 and 3 of our brief we quote both Section
17 from the '33 Act, which is the antifraud provision there,
and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 from the '34 Act, and I
direct the Court's attention to this difference between the
two, which I say the court below overlooked entirely.
Section 17(a) says;

It shall be unlawful for any

person in the offer or s?ile of any securities by use of
interstate facilities and so forth to employ fraud.
In other words, the fraud must be in the offer or
sale of any securities.
Whereas, in the '34 Act, the requirement is not that
the fraud be right inside of the sale or purchase itself, but
that it be in connection with the purchase or sale.
Now, you're not ascribing anything, any meaning at
all to those words in that difference between these two
statutes if you rule,as the court below did, that this is not
a case stated under 10(b) and lQfc-5 in this case.
Then I would direct your attention to the bottom of
page 3 and the top of page 4, to the fact that Rule 10b-5 has
^hree subparagraphs.

I submit that the court below refused to

26
take any cognisance of subparagraphs (1) and (3) of that rule.
They fragmented this thing down to the point where they refused
to look at it as an over-all scheme, device, or artifice to
defraud, which is the words used in subparagraph (1)? or to
look upon it, as subparagraph (3) says, as engaging in an act,
practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or
deceit upon any person.
They analyzed this case solely in terms of the
second paragraph, the second subparagraph of Rule 10b-5, and
even there took an unduly limited and restricted view of it,
because it says that it shall be unlawful to make any untrue
statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material
fact in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.
As counsel has already said, there's abundant
evidence that they did misrepresent to the directors, and
they did fail to disclose to the directors their true
intention as to what they were going to do with the proceeds
of this sale of bonds.
Remember, they had earlier in the day gone to the
bank and got a $5 million check written, with nothing behind
it.

They obviously had to be intending to convert the proceeds

of the sale of the bonds in order to cover the check;.and that's
exactly what they did.

And they deceived the directors in

tiiat respect.
So i. say that the court, by refusing to look at the

27
thing in that sort of a way, and by refusing to connect that
one sale of government bonds, — which, by the way, is the
particular transaction that the government relies on in this
case --- they refused to look upon that as part of an over-all
scheme.

And the other parts of which were also essential to

the scheme, and all of which should be considered as a package
not as individual fragmented facts.
Q

But you do separate the bonds from the stock,

I take it?
MR. NORTH:

We separate the bonds from the stock only

to the extent that we say that the government relies on the
bond sal© as the basis for which we say the Court of Appeals
below should be reversed.
Q

But not that you couldn't go further?

MR. NORTH:
Q

Certainly not.

You don't need to g-o any further than this, is

that it?
MR. NORTH:

That as long as we show that some one

part of the scheme involved the purchase or sale, or was in
connection with the purchase or sale of —
Q

Well, you aren't saying that in your view the

stock transaction was a separate transaction?
MR. NORTH:

We say the stock transaction was a part

of the over-all scheme, the same as the bond sale, and the same
as these subsequent things they did, the transactions they

28

carried out in the afternoon of that day, while they went
through this business of chasing themselves out around a circle
and coming back, where they ended exactly where they started
from? that was all a part of the scheme to defraud.
The reason that we didn't dwell upon the sal© of
Manhattan's own stock, from Bankers Life to the defrauders,
as a part of our case is because that runs directly contrary
to Birnbaum, which says that the defrauded party must be
either a purchaser or a seller.

Well, of course, Manhattan

itself didn't sell anything or buy anything.
Q

Is the Commission asking that Birnbaum be

reconsidered?
MR. NORTH:
occasions.

We have suggested that on a number of

We have suggested it in the Second Circuit itself.
Q

Are you suggesting it here?

MR. NORTH:

And we suggested it in this case,

largely just by way of a footnote that says that we have never
agreed to that theory.
But we realize that in order to win this case on
that ground you'd have to overturn Birnbaum, whereas you don't
necessarily have to overturn it in the other context.
Incidentally, I think it's quite significant in that
regard that Judge Hays, who dissented, as one member of the
three-judge panel that decided this very case we're arguing
today, he just flatly would overrule Birnbaum.

29

Let me read you just two sentences of his, but his
opinion is only a page and a half long, and it's reprinted
in the Appendix on pages 109 to 110; just two sentences.
He sayss

"Manhattan was the victim of a 8scheme to

defraud8" — which is the language of the Rule.

"Since the

f

vital center of the scheme, the vehicle for the perpetration of
th© fraud, was the sale of Manhattan's stock, it seems to me
to be completely unrealistic to say that the fraud was not
committed 'in connection with the purchase or sale of any
security'."
Well, now, Judge Hays knows, just as well as any of
us here in the room do, that the sale of Manhattan stock did
not involve Manhattan as either the purchaser or th© seller;
so he is saying in so many words that when you've got an
over-all scheme to defraud, you don't fragment it, you look at
the over-all scheme, and if any part of it was in connection
with the purchase or sale of securities, that's the answer.
The answer doesn't lie in the question of whether the plaintiff
himself happened to be a purchaser or a seller.
And it seems to me that anything short of that simply
overlooks the difference in the wording between Section 17 of
the '33 Act and Section 10(b) and Rule lQb-5 of the '34 Act,
because the one says it must foe in connection with the sale,
whereas the other simply says — one says it must be in the
sale or in the purchase, whereas the other simply says it has

30

to be in connection with a purchase or sal© by any person.
I'd like to deal for just a moment with this
question of whether we're pursuing a purely self-inflicted
fraud that really didn't hurt anybody,, because Mr. Begole, or
Mr. Begole and Bourne themselves were the sole owners of this
corporation.
That kind of a position,, of course, overlooks that
community of interest which a corporation represents, over
and beyond the interest of the stockholders or stockholder
alone.

If you had, for example, a corporation that had out­

standing bonds or debentures or other form of debt securities,
you certainly wouldn't say that they weren't — that that
interest wasn't to be protected, and likewise the interest of
other creditors and policyholders, is ail a part of the over­
all corporate community that the statute is designed1 to
protect, not just to protect alone the shareholder who, in this
c

case, was the sole shareholder and who is the one who
perpetrated the fraud.
Q

Well, do creditors normally have a right to

bring © suit on behalf of the corporation?
MR. NORTH:
Q

No.

You mean under 10b-5?
It could be under State lav; or under normal

corporate law.
MR. NORTH:

The representative of the creditors

certainly would have that right, and here the plaintiff in this

31

case is the Superintendent of Insurance.
Q

Could bring a derivative action on behalf of the

c orporation?
MR. NORTHS
Q

How's that?

Do creditors normally have the right to bring

derivative actions on behalf of the corporation?
MR. NORTH:

No, I don't know as I'd say that.

I don't think that's the key thing here.

But

The key thing here

is that the action is being brought by the Superintendent of
Insurance derivatively on behalf of the corporation, which in
turn had some creditors.

So that the creditors are a part of

the community of interest which is being protected by this
suit under 10b-5.
Q

Have those creditors' claims been unsatisfied?

MR. NORTH:

I don't know to what extent there are

still outstanding unsatisfied claims, I think I would, have to
refer that question, maybe, to private counsel; but I do know
that .
Q

But wouldn't that be an important factor, if

the creditors have been paid in full, wouldn't that be a
relevant fact?
MR. NORTH:

In the process, to whatever extent the

creditors have been paid, I would assume that in the process
someone else has been subrogated to their rights.

The

Superintendent of Insurance is not bringing this action on

32
behalf of Mr. Begole, that’s certain.
And there is abundant authority for the proposition
that creditors are entitled to protection.

Your own case here

of Pepper versus Litton, which is cited in our brief, while it
predates the Federal Securities laws, makes it perfectly clear
that a so-called self-inflicted fraud by somebody who controls
the corporation still can't be relied upon as a means of
defeating the action which is brought on behalf of creditors,
or anyone who has dealt with or contracted with the corpora­
tion.
Q

So you look at this as something like a transfer

by a corporation in fraud or prejudice?
MR.NORTHz
Q

Yes, something to that effect.

That might amount to an act of bankruptcy, for

example.
MR. NORTH:

That's it.

That could be.

Now,the leading case, I think, in this area that
actually does come under the Federal Securities laws, whereas
Pepper versus Litton was just before the ‘34 Act, the leading
case that does come under the Federal Securities laws is
the Hooper versus Mountain States case.

And in there it was

plainly held that even though the corporation itself was
controlled by the person who committed the fraud that that
didn't mean there couldn't be recovery to the benefit of
creditors or anybody else v?ho had dealt with the corporation

33

in reliance on the fraudulent transaction-.
And the Bailes case, which was referred to here
earlier, is to the same effect, end it's so recent that it
doesn't even appear in our brief? it was decided since our
brief was written.
I think ,ifc's important in this connection to note
that Congress, at the very time it was drafting this statute,
had in mind, in relation to insurance companies, the fact
that creditors and policyholders could be involved.
The House Report — I am paraphrasing or quoting
now approximately from a footnote on page 27 of our brief.
The House Report on the bill which became the 1934 Act noted
that"over 15 million individuals hold insurance policies, the
value of which is dependent upon the security holdings of
insurance companies."
That's quoted exactly from the House Report.
The Senate Report went on to observe that the ctorrent
value of securities held by insurance companies, and
consequently the welfare of the countless individuals who have
a financial interest in such institutions is directly affected
by the activities — and he's talking now about the activities
in the trading and sale of securities.
So, while it can be said that Congress was not
perhaps directly concerned with creditors and policyholders,
as such, to the extent that part of the community of interest

34

that makes up an insurance company is the creditors and policy­
holders, that is a part of what Congress was directing itself
to when it enacted the antifraud provisions of the 1934 Act.
Q

Would you take the same approach if the sale

of the bonds went through and there had been no previous
intention to steal the money, and then one of the officers did
just walk off with the cash?
MR. NORTH: Well, that would be a little harder case,
but —
Q

Well, it's the proceeds —

MR. NORTH:
Q

I realise that.

— and he suddenly gets the idea, walking back

from the bank, that it might be well to go to South America?
and he goes.

The corporation never gets the proceeds.

MR. NORTH:

I wouldn't be prepared to concede that

there would not be a 10b-5 action even under those circum­
stances; but this case is much stronger than that, because
there was a preconceived plan or scheme to do this very thing,
and the sale of the securities was a part of that scheme.
Q

Doesn't the Court of Appeals seem to think that

perhaps the Securities laws weren't intended just to cover
ordinary fraud by a director or an officer, and it would be
difficult to contain the reach of the 10(b) if this case
were covered?
MR. NORTH:

That is a part of the type of reasoning

35

that the court below used in this case»

But as long as you

maintain the integrity of the requirement that the fraud be
in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, there is
certainly no danger that the Federal Securities laws are going
to take over the whole field of corporate'-management, mis­
management, and looting, and everything else where securities
transactions are not involved; the securities transaction must
still be a part of the fraudulent scheme in order for the
Federal Securities law to apply.
Q

That would be true, you say, even if you

eliminated the purchaser-seller requirement?

As long as there

was a sale somewhere.
MR. NORTH:

Mr. Justice White, I assume you are

talking now about the requirement that the plaintiff himself
be a purchaser or a seller.
I think the requirement that the purchaser or seller
himself —■ or the —
Q

The plaintiff.

MR. NORTH:

— the plaintiff himself be a purchaser

or seller can be done away with and still not make this Federal
Securities law's antifraud provision an undue incursion upon
the State law of fraud.

As long as it is in connection with

the puurchase or sale.
That's why I would say that even this initial sale
of all Manhattan stock to Begole should come within the purview

36

of this, and would in some other circuits, though obviously it
can't in the Second Circuit unless and until the Birnbaum case
is overruled.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think your time is up,

Mr. North.
MR. NORTH:

I believe it is, Your Honor, and I'm

sorry if I ran over.
I thank you very much.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you.

Mr. Karatz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM WARREN KARAT?,, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT IRVING TRUST COMPANY
MR. KARATZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Plaintiff's basic contention here is that a claim
under the Federal Securities law is stated because Manhattan's
sole shareholder misappropriated Manhattan's funds insofar as
the proceeds from the sale of Manhattan's bonds were concerned.
There are at least two reasons why plaintiff is
wrong in asserting that Manhattan has any claim under Federal
lav; in connection with this transaction.
First, there was no deception of or damage to
Manhattan, because Manhattan's sole shareholder knew of,
participated in, benefitted from, and fully ratified the
allegedly fraudulent transaction.

37
Since Manhattan, by way of its sole shareholder,
could not have been deceived, suffered no damage, there was no
Federal fraud in connection with the sale of any securities,
either the Manhattan bonds or anything else.
Now, Mr. Bauman and Mr. North have suggested that
there is something to a corporation other than its shareholders.
I would suggest that it is standard corporate law that when
shareholders fully ratify the action taken by a corporation,
that becomes corporate action.
Now, it may be that such action would constitute a
fraud on creditors.
this area.

There is long-established common law in

If corporate insiders, by their actions with regard

to the corporation, in some v/ay damage creditors, creditors have
remedies at common lav? and by statute in all the States.
They have remedies by way of an action for fraudulent
conveyance.

They have remedies by way of an action for illegal

dividend.
There was no need for Congress to provide creditor
remedies.

Those remedies already were available to creditors.

And I suggest that if you have sole stockholder approval of an
action, certainly under Federal law and Federal Securities law,
there can be no fraud on the corporation.
Q

Why is it so important to you, though, to be in

the State court rather than the Federal court?
MR. KARATZ:

Your Honor, if I may be very frank about

38

the reason why we are here today — and, quite frankly, I'm
glad I'm here today because I think this is an important issue
of lav;

because Chief Judge Ryan invited the defendants to

make a motion to dismiss.
If I may tell you quite frankly what the tactics of
defense cotinsel was in this case, we were going to take it
through the trial in the Federal courts and then get the case
dismissed.

Because we did not think that there was a Federal

claim here.
We went all the way through years of pretrial dis­
covery, thousands of pages of testimony, hundreds of documents.
Chief Judge Ryan, when Mr. Parker made a motion for summary
judgment, refused to decide the motion for summary judgment on
its merits, stating that in his view the complaint did not
spell out a claim, and suggested to counsel that a motion to
dismiss be made; because he felt that this was not a Federal
action and that rhe Federal courts in the Southern District of
New York should not have to go through the trial that would
take weeks if not months.
We made that motion to dismiss pursuant to the
suggestion of Judge Ryan, and we were sustained in our belief
all the way up to this Court that there is no Federal claim
here.
Nov;, in response to Judge Blackrnun’s question as to
why we preferred to be in the State courts, we don't necessarily

39

prefer to be in the State Courts, Your Honor, we just feel that
that's the place where we should be, because of the state of
the law.
And I might say that, as a member of the bar of New
York, I do not believe that the ceilendar of the Southern
District should be clogged with lGb-5 cases, as it is today,
which do not rightfully belong there.
The second reason why plaintiff is wrong in asserting
that there's been an injury to Manhattan in connection with the
purchase or sale of securities is that this case does not
involve any impurity in any securities transaction.
As the courts below concluded, there can be no fraud
in connection with a securities transaction when none of the
following three facts are involved:
First, this case does not involve the purchase or
sale of any securities for more or less than its fair market
value.
Second, this case does not involve any actual or
potential manipulation or abuse of the trading process.
Third, this case does not involve any injury to any
Manhattan shareholder or to any other member of the investing
public.
What this case does involve. Your Honors, is a
claim that defendant Begole, the sole shareholder of Manhattan,
misappropriated Manhattan funds for his own benefit, and that

40

this misappropriation v/as not reported to the Superintendent
of Insurance of the State of New York.
Q

Mr. Karatz, you represent Irving Trust?

MR. KARATZ:
Q

Yes, sir.

What did Irving Trust get out of the deal?

Some kind of a fee for these $5 million checks?
MR. KARATZ:

No.

Quite frankly, Your Honor, Irving

received no fee for the five — let me break up the checks.
The first $5 million check, the one payable to Bankers Life
and Casualty Company, which constituted the payment by Mr.
Begole for the stock, was delivered by the Irving officer to
the Bankers Life representative at the closing as a
convenience to Mr. Garvin, who was one of the leading members
of the New York brokerage community.

Mr. Garvin's house was

well recognized as a leader in the area of government bond
securities, and certificates of deposit.
I might say that the way business is done on Wall
Street is by requests being made by people who are respected,
and those requests being honored.

Millions of dollars of

business are done every day by all of the leading banks in
New York City on word of mouth, without any paper being trans­
ferred.
Mr. Garvin came to Mr. Gunter, who was an assistant
secretary of Irving Trust Company, who had known Mr. Garvin
for years, who had known his brokerage house for years, and

41
requested that $5 million be given in return for funds which
would be returned to Irving the sarae day.
convenience to Mr. Garvin.

This was a

It was something which is not

unusual in the Wall Street community.
Q

And the second check?

MR. KARATZs

The second check, Your Honor, let m® say

how that came about.
After the first transaction, namely the closing at
Manhattan, had taken place, Mr. Gunter got back to the bank,
he received a telephone call from Mr. Garvin, and he said that
there was a second half to the transaction.

Mr. Gunter

replied to Mr. Garvin, — and this is all in testimony in pre­
trial discovery -- "I wasn't aware of any second half of the
transaction."

And Mr. Garvin just said, "Well, this is just a

simple check swap which is going to take place at BelgianAmerican Bank.

You will give $5 million and you will get back

$5 million."
.

And Mr. Gunter, under those circumstances, did not

feel that there was any reason why he shouldn't

go along with

the request of this respected member of the brokerage
community and did so.
Q

By this time, I gather, the bank had been paid

the proceeds of the sale?
MR. KARATZ;

No, sir.

There was an attempt to

indicate to the court that there was a nice cleancut arrangement,

42

whereby you had a morning transaction and an afternoon trans­
action.

The facts in this case are not that simple.

And I

would refer Your Honors, for a detailed statement of them, to
the Appendix in my brief, where we do try to take you step by
step through these complex transactions.
In response to your question, Mr. Justice Brennan,
when Mr. Gunter went to Belgian-American in the afternoon, the
government bonds of Manhattan had not yet been sold.
Certainly the amount for which they were sold had not yet been
indicated.
The way that this operated was that the government
bond transaction, the sale of government bonds, was a private
transaction between Manhattan Casualty and Second District
Securities, a large bond house in New York.
The bonds were gradually delivered to Second
District and notices came from Second District during the
course of the day and on into the evening as to the amount
which was being paid for the bonds.

For the amount being paid

for the bonds depended on the going rate for those bonds at
the particular time of delivery.
So, during the entire course of the day, afternoon,
and into the evening — and I might say that Mr. Gunter's
responsibility was in the security clearance division of the
bank.

The securities clearance division has to do with

receipt of securities and payment for securities.

And literally

43

hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions are dealt with
every day by Irving Trust Company alone, in this particular
division of the bank.
So when Mr. Gunter went horns that evening, which was,
as I recall the testimony in pretrial, 8 or 9 o'clock, he
still wasn't sure exactly how much had been received for the
securities during the course of the day.

I might also say that,

as has been pointed out to Your Honors, the bonds ultimately
produced only $4,800,000-odd.
$150,000 check of Manhattan, drawn on another bank,
was delivered to Irving sometime during the late afternoon of
January 24th.

That check was payable to the order of

Manhattan Casualty Company, and that check constituted a credit
to Manhattan's account at Irving, and in fact that's exactly
what form it took.

The Manhattan check, draxvn on another

bank, payable to itself for $150,000, was credited to Manhattan's
account at Irving.
Q
Irving Trust.

We're told that there were false entries made by
Is that right?

MR. KARATZ:

I deny that, sir.

They were not false

entries.
The entries which were made at Irving were corrected
when Mr. Gunter came to understand what he thought the true
situation was.
before trial;

If I may, sir, go into Mr. Gunter's examination

44
Mr. Gunter originally was led to believe by Mr»
Garvin that the morning check for $5 million would be covered
by a receipt by Irving Trust later on in the day of securities
which would be sold, and the proceeds applied to cover the
$5 million check.
Q

Sold by Irving?

MR. KARATZ:
District.

No.

Sold by Manhattan to Second

They would just be delivered to Irving for purposes

of re-delivery to the purchaser of the bonds.
Mr. Gunter was also informed, as I mentioned in reply
to an earlier question, that the second transaction, the second
$5 million transaction, was just a check swap.
It turned out, however, that when the documentation
for what had gone on during the course of the day started to
come into the bank, and it started to come in on January 24th,
Mr. Gunter gathered that he had mis tinder stood what the true
situation was and made the entries which complied with the
written instructions which he was receiving from various
people.
Nov;, what were the written instructions?
Mr. Gunter received sometime during the course of the
day, on January 24, a letter from Manhattan Casualty Company,
signed by Mr, Sweeny as president of Manhattan, instructing
Irving to transfer $5 million from Manhattan’s account at
Irving to Belgian-American«.

45

Now, this was duly signed by a representative of
Manhattan Casualty, whose name appeared on Irving's books as
an authorised signatory for the Manhattan account, which was
also opened on January 24th,
Q

Do I understand that Manhattan had maintained an

account with Irving?
MR. KARATZ;

No.

Manhattan opened an account on that

very day.
Q

When the $150,000, plus or minus, check came in?

MR. KARATZ;

That certainly was one of the first

items in it, sir.
Q

So this is all a brand-new account on Irving's

books?
MR. KARATZ;

Well, let me say this, Mr. Justice

Brennan, — I'm sorry; Blackmun.

It is a new account as of

January 24th, but Manhattan Casualty had been a customer of
Irving's in years past.

They were not a customer as of

January 24th, but it was not really a new customer, it was
just a renewal of an old relationship.
To go back to Mr. Justice Douglas's question;

when

Mr. Gunter, at the end of the business day or early the next
day — because, as I say, he didn't leave the bank because of
the rush of business until late in the evening — saw this
letter from Mr. Sweeny, he recognized the afternoon transaction
as having been a transfer of Manhattan's funds to Belgian-

46

American» a transfer which should be debted to the Manhattan
account at Irving.
Q

And that's exactly what he did.

So —

How much was there in the account at that time?

MR. KAEATZ:

As of that time. Your Honor — well,

I'm sorry, Mr. Justice Marshall, as of which time?
Q

The time when he had credited, I think in the

evening was when he —
MR. KARATZ:

Well, let me say, at the time that he

credited the — well, I'm sorry, when he debited or credited,
sir?

I mean, which item are we talking about?
Q

Well, why not do it on both?

MR. KARATZ:

Okay.

Let me tell you the history of

the situation, so far as Irving is concerned.
Q

Well, when they issued the $5 million check,

how much did Manhattan have in Irving?
MR. KARATZ:
Q

When Irving issued —

Zero.

MR. KARATZ:

— the $5 million afternoon check, Mr.

Gunter of course did not know that he was supposed to be doing
this pursuant to the instructions of Manhattan.

At that time

he was acting pursuant to these oral instructions of Mr.
Garvin, saying that this was the second half of the transaction.
By the time he saw the letter from Mr. Sweeny,
instructing the $5 million transaction to take place in the
afternoon of January 24th, Manhattan had credited to its

47
account the $4,800,000 proceeds from the sale of the securities,
plus the $150,000 check.
Q

I thought you said it was late at night and

they hadn’t sold them all yet?
MR. KARATZ:

No, but the> bookkeeping entries were

actually made on January 25th as of January 24th, by the time
they caught up with those —
Q

From what I understand about bookkeeping entries

is, I assume that it means that money is passed, or am I
mistaken?
MR. KARATZ: Well, no, sir.

Actually, at the time the

bookkeeping entries were made, the money in fact was there.
Q

In the afternoon?

MR. KARATZ:

No, I'm talking about the entries, sir,

to the Manhattan account.
Q

Yes.

When were they made, in the afternoon,

weren't they?
MR. KARATZ:

No, the entries to the Manhattan account

were made on January 25th as of January 24th, at which time
they were able to catch up with all of the business which had
accumulated during the day.
And, Your Honors, once again I have to emphasise that
we are dealing here with the department of a bank which has
literally hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions every
day; this is not an isolated situation.

Pardon?

Many of them, sir, are done just by

Many are done on the faith and good word of the

people in the financial community.

If you cannot rely on that

on Wall Street, then you would have to close up a good many
of the financial institutions that you have today.
And let me say, sir, that the first entry in the
Manhattan account was the crediting of the $150,000 check,
which was received late in the afternoon of January 24.
Have I answered your question, sir?
Q

I’ve heard what you said!

[Laughter. ]
MR. KARATZ:

As I have stated previously,; Your

Honors, the unique facts in this case may indeed form the
basis for State action, based on such theories as embezzlement,
fraudulent conveyance, conversion, corporate waste, or
violation of the New York State insurance law.
However, these unique facts do not — and I
emphasize it, Your Honors, do not — involve any wrongdoing
prohibited by Federal Securities laws.
The Congressional purpose underlying the enactment
of the Securities Act was to promote free and open public
securities markets, and to protect the investing public from

49

suffering inequities in trading.
These Acts i?ere not intended to constitute a general
Federal corporation lav/.

In fact. Congress has often rejected

the idea of a general Federal corporate code.
More specifically, —
Q

Mr. Karatz, I come back to my question;

What

real difference does it make to Irving Trust Company whether
this litigation is resolved on the State side or the Federal
side?

What is it that you fear in being brought under the

Federal umbrella at this point?
MR. KARATZ;
0

May I be very frank with Your Honor?

I would like to have you answer it, because I

think before the only answer you gave me was that you were
reluctant in clogging the federal court calendar.
MR. KARATZ:

Here once again, sir, I will go into our

strategy, which, possibly, is something I should not do.
Quite frankly, I do not believe that my opponent is
happy in the New York State courts.

He has much more experience

in the Federal courts, he's more familiar with finding his way
around the Federal courtsj rightly or wrongly, that’s the con­
clusion we have reached, that he would be unhappier in the
State courts.

It's not a question of where we would be happiest.

To return to the question of the Congressional
intent:

Congress did not intend, by the enactment of the

Securities laws, to create Federal law which would govern every

50

corporate management transaction.
Absent compelling reasons, it would seem inappropri­
ate to inject the antifraud doctrine of Rule 10b~5 into a case
where the unique question is the fiduciary duty owed by a sole
shareholder to his corporation and its creditors.
Once again, I emphasize. Your Honors, that State
common and statutory law have long provided adequate remedies
for whatever creditors there may be .in this picture.

And

with regard to the creditors, Your Honors, let me say this?
At the time of the liquidation, all of the policy­
holders of Manhattan were reinsured, so those policyholders are
no longer in the picture.
Insofar as any other creditors are concerned, we have
strained, through years of pretrial discovery, to find out if
in fact any creditors exist.

We have yet to be given any

concrete information as to whether there is in fact any
creditors.
But once again I emphasize to Your Honors that even
if there are creditors, the creditors are perfectly capable of
having their remedy by way of the long-established State
remedies.
courts.

Mr. Bauman is bringing an action in the State
There is the place, under State law, to look into the

situation, to see whether there are creditors and, if there are
creditors, to provide the proper remedy.
There is no reason why the Federal courts, by way of

51
an implied cause of action under Section lo(b), should preempt
this entire well-developed area of State law of creditor’s
rights, when it is clear, from the reading of the Securities
Acts as a whole, that Congress did not so intend.
It should be left to Congress to decide whether the
enforcement of a substantial part of what is now corporate law
should be assumed by the Federal courts.
And I might say in this respect, Your Honors, that
Congress has not been delinquent.

Congress is constantly

analyzing the Securities Acts to decide whether there should be
amendments thereto.

There are hearings going on across the

street at the present time with regards to possible amendments
to the Securities Acts.

There are also hearings going on

with regard to the proper division of jurisdiction between the
Federal and the State courts.
I suggest that this is something that should be left
to Congress to analyze, and,by way of carefully held hearings,
determine to what extent Congress wants to take over general
corporate law.
The petitioner and the Commission, in urging this
Court to reverse the decision of the courts below, are, in
effect, asking for an extension of Rule 10b-5 far beyond any
other case.

They are, in effect, asking this Court to hold

that an alleged act of corporate mismanagement, which does not
involve a manipulation or deception intrinsic to the securities

52

transaction, to be a Federal wrong.
Such an extension of the coverage of the Securities
Act is not necessary in order to carry out the Congressional
intent.
I know that Your Honors have held in prior cases that
the Securities Act should be broadly construed, so as to carry
out the Congressional intent.
agree with that.

I happen to wholeheartedly

I also wholeheartedly agree that there should

be a private cause of action under Section 10(b); but I do
not believe that Section 10(b) should be construed in such a
way as to bring within the scope of federal jurisdiction
matters which Congress never intended the Federal courts to
exercise jurisdiction over.
Judge Herlands, in dismissing the complaint herein,
not only examined the complaint but he examined the entire
pretrial record, which was years in the making.

After taking

the motion to dismiss under advisement for over nine months,
he came out with his, what I believe to be, well-considered
opinion, and his well-reasoned opinion, in which he concluded
that under the unique facts in this action you did not have a
federal claim.
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed
Judge Herlands.
And I might say also that, possibly because Judge
Herlands came through with a lengthy opinion, we forget Judge

Ryan.

Not only was a motion to dismiss made before Judge

Herlands, but a similar motion was, made before Judge Ryan,
who also considered the matter in excess of nine months and
then came out with an opinion agreeing with Judge Herlands.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the opinions of both
Judge Herlands and Judge Ryan, and I think it's a matter of
general knowledge that it is the Second Circuit which, after
all, has had to give consideration to most of the Securities
Acts cases.

And I think it's fair to say the Second Circuit

has uniformly broadly interpreted the Securities Act cases
before it, so as to provide a remedy, when one is necessary,
to carry out the Congressional intent.
As Judge Herlands stated below, this is an another
of many of the recurring cases in which the question basically
iss Does the plaintiff belong in the State courts or has he
spelled out a Federal claim?
This case, once again I emphasise, involvas a mis­
appropriation of corporate assets by a sole shareholder of a
corporation.

It involves no injury to any public investor,

it involves no purchase or sale of any securities for less than
its fair value, and it had no effect whatsoever on any
securities market.
On these unique facts, I suggest, Your Honors, the
plaintiff has stated no Federal claim, and that he should
pursue his remedy in a State court action which was brought

54

against these same plaintiffs, based on the same facts, and
in which he asks for the same damages.
If 1 may, Your Honors, there were just a few
questions posed this morning to Mr. Bauman which I might
respond to.
were sold.

I believe Mr. Justice White asked how the bonds
I believe I responded to that, that it was a

private sale transaction between Manhattan and Second District
Securities.
Once again, there no securities market was involved.
No public exchange was involved.
If I may go to this question of creditor standing,
under the Securities laws:

It is my position that Congress did

not intend to provide any rights under the Securities laws to
creditors as a class.

The Securities laws, if you read them,

from the beginning to the end, were composed to provide
remedies to security holders, to purchasers and sellers of
securities.
Once again, I suggest that was no need to provide a
remedy to creditors, because creditors already have adequate
remedy in the State courts.
I would suggest that if you look at the Field versus
Lew case, you will see — which was referred to by Mr. Bauman
and which is cited at length in my brief — you will see that
it is vary relevant to the issue before Your Honors.

What

Field versus Lev? does is to analyze what a corporation is,

55
and in that case it was concluded by the District Court that
when the sole stockholder of a ccorporation ratifies and
participates in a corporate transaction, it is corporate action.
The corporation thereafter has no remedy against the sole
stockholder.

The remedy of any creditor who is damaged is by

way of an action for fraudulent conveyance or some similar
type of action.
Now, if the situation has resulted in a Trustee in
Bankruptcy being appointed under the Bankruptcy law, then I
think the Field case clearly demonstrates the division of
responsibility that a Trustee in Bankruptcy has.

A Trustee in

Bankruptcy can sue on behalf of the corporation, and he can
sue on behalf of the creditors.
But I suggest that what was happening in Field was
that the Trustee in Bankruptcy, the plaintiff there, was being
told that because of the ratification of the actions by the
sole stockholder, he had no cause of action on behalf of the
corporation.

That doesn't mean he doesn't have a cause of

action on behalf of the creditors.
But to carry that analysis into this case, if in fact
what Mr. Bauman is doing is suing on behalf of creditors, then
I suggest that under the Birnbaum doctrine he has no standing
to sue because the creditors are not purchasers or sellers of
a security.

And I suggest, Your Honors, that Birnbaum not only

is law in the Second Circuit, it’s lav; in all the circuits

55
which have carefully considered the question, and I think
rightfully should remain the lav?.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Parker.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING PARKER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT BANKERS LIFE AND CASUALTY CO.
MR. PARKER;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court;
I appear principally in the interest of respondent
Bankers Life and Casualty Company, as to whom the facts and the
proceedings in this case are unique.
However this Court may interpret Section 10(b) of the
19 34 Act and Rule 10b*-5 promulgated thereunder, petitioner has
not and he cannot state a claim for which relief can be
granted against Bankers Life.
Neither the complaint itself nor the complaint
supplemented by a comprehensive discovery record provides a
single factual allegation which in any respect supports any
claim against Bankers Life.
The only conceivable reason that Bankers Life was
made a party to the action and is here today is that it happened
to own the stock of Manhattan Casualty Company and sold it in
January 1962, after months of negotiations.
The sale was arm1s-length

,

and the only conclusion

which the record permits is that the sale was free from any
impropriety in any respect whatsoever on the part of Bankers

57
Life.
In November 1963, shortly after the action was
commenced, and the insurance department had completed a lengthy
investigation into the circumstances which led to the liquida­
tion of Manhattan, the petitioner, the Superintendent of
Insurance as liquidator of Manhattan, was deposed.

Upon

deposition, the essence of the petitioner's testimony was that
he could not assert any facts to justify inclusion of Bankers
Life as a party in any way connected with any of the alleged
wrongs upon which the action was based.
The utter speculative basis upon which Bankers Life
was named a party was clearly revealed by the petitioner's
testimonial admission that he could not factually support any
claim against Bankers Life, and to attempt to do so he required
an opportunity to conduct discovery proceedings.

And so

petitioner proceeded to discover.
By early 1968, petitioner concluded some four and onehalf years of discovery —
Q

You are speaking now of the Federal discovery?

MR. PARKER:

Yes, Your Honor.

— in this case.

Through his attorneys, petitioner

deposed almost 40 witnesses, and amassed a record of some
12,000 pages of transcript and hundreds of documents, but
petitioner still could not provide a single factual allegation
to justify retention of Bankers Life as a party to the action.

58
Consequently -~
Q

That goes to the merits, doesn't it?

MR. PARKER ;

Your Honor, it goes to this jurisdictional

question.
Q

Because there are other defendants, other than

Bankers?
MR. PARKER; There are, Your Honor.

And the fact of

the matter is, Your Honor -Q

So that if there is a cause of action against

one of them under the Securities Act, this should be reversed,
shouldn't it, now?
MR. PARKER;

No, Your Honor. There is precedent for

v/hat I am contending for here.

And I will come to that, Your

Honor.
Q

All right.

MR. PARKER;

In any event, in April of 1968, Bankers

Life moved before the District Court for summary judgment,
pursuant to Rule 56, on the ground that there was no triable
issue of fact as to Bankers Life, and that it was entitled to
judgment as a matter of law.
Bankers Life was the only defendent who so moved.
When the motion was made, the petitioner indicated
his need for, and he obtained sufficient time within which to
search the discovery record, in the hope that he could find
something upon which to base an opposition to that motion.

59

The motion was heard upon extensive and comprehensive
affidavits before Judge Sylvester Ryan, who found that
petitioner had nowhere charged that Bankers Life had participated
in the negotiations for the raising of the purchase price for
the Manhattan stock, or even that. Bankers Life had any
knowledge of those negotiations, and Judge Ryan's exact words
are at page 42a of the Appendix.
Nevertheless, Judge Ryan denied the summary judgment
motion, but he did so expressly stating that it was not on the
merits and it was without prejudice, and he explained that he
could not dispose of the motion because of the need, first,
to determine petitioner's questionable claim of Federal
jurisdiction.

And so the motions to dismiss for lack of

jurisdiction were made.

And it is as a result of the dismissal

of the complaint and its affirmance by the Court of Appeals
that the respondents who made such motions are here.
As to Bankers Life, it simply is not involved in the
questions presented, whether there were schemes or devices
«

employed by others in connection with any transactions com”
plained of by the petitioner or relied upon by the SEC.
The absence of any connection of Bankers Life v/ith
any schemes or devices was confirmed by petitioner's attorney
in open court as long ago as November 1963; first referring to
the facts of the sale of the Manhattan stock, petitioner's
attorney describing his claim stated, and I quote:

"Thereafter

60
the complaint alleges that defendants,, other than Mr. Parker’s
client, namely Bankers Life, entered into a scheme to cover
up this depletion of the corporate,’ assets which was successful
for about a year and a half."

Close the quote.

Since the time that statement was made, petitioner
has been unable to alter the admitted la'ck of any connection
between any of the transactions complained of and Bankers Life.
The conclusion, set forth at page 37 of petitioner’s
main brief, plainly evidences that the heart of his purported
Federal claim is based upon the circumstances of the sale of
the Manhattan government bonds and the misappropriation of the
proceeds of that sale, with none of which Bankers Life had any
connection whatsoever.
These transactions occurred after the purchaser had
acquired the stock, had taken control of the company, and had
installed a board of directors.
It was petitioner's own analysis of his complaint,
supplemented by the extensive discovery record, which led
Judge Ryan to the conclusion that I mentioned before? namely,
that there was no charge in this entire record whatsoever made
that Bankers Life participated in or even had any knowledge of
the transactions relating to the raising of the purchase
price for -the Manhattan stock.
The absence of any basis for asserting any Federal
claim against Bankers Life is also confirmed by petitioner’s

61

Reply Brief.
First, as to the brief for Bankers Life;

The

principal point of the brief for Bankers Life is that no
Federal claim has been asserted against Bankers Life, and that
Federal jurisdiction does not exist as to it.
Q

Now, are you suggesting that we should — even

if we reverse the Court of Appeals, we should, nevertheless,
give judgment for Bankers Life?
MR. PARKER;

In thirty seconds I will answer your

question, if I may, Your Honor.
Thank you.
As to the petitioner's Reply Brief, he has not in
any respect controverted* this inescapable conclusion that, there
is no Federal jurisdiction as to Bankers Life, or that
dismissal of the complaint was unquestionably correct as to
Bankers Life.
Nevertheless, we believe that the judgment below
should be affirmed in all respects.

We believe, further, that

in any event that judgment should certainly be affirmed as to
Bankers Life.
Q

But the one —

MR. PARKER;

When the Court of Appeals, sir, and I

think I can anticipate your question, because I will not over­
look it, when the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was
presented with a similar situation involving multiple defendants,

62
in Schoenbaum against Pirstbrook, which is reported at 405 Fed
2d at 215, a case involving Rule 10b-5, a case which was heard
@n banc, that court affirmed dismissal of the complaint for
lack of jurisdiction in respect of that single defendant as
to whom there was no showing made of any participation in the
wrongs complained of.
Q

Shouldn't we have the judgment of the Court of

Appeals on that aspect of the case before we dealt with it?
MR. PARKERS

Dividing Bankers Life from the others?

There was no occasion for them to do it, Your Honor; I think,
as the Court of Appeals saw it, —■
Q

Well, I understand that.

MR. PARKER:
Q

Yes.

I mean that on their approach there was no

Federal jurisdiction as to anybody.
MR. PARKER: And I think they were correct about that,
Your Honor.
Q

And I think they are correct.
All right, I understand that.

But assume they

were wrong about that.
MR. PARKER:

That there was Federal jurisdiction in

soma form as to some parties?
Q

As to some parties, yes.

MR. PARKER:

Still, I would think, and I think that

on the basis of Schoenbaum v. Firstbrook, the Court of Appeals
would certainly have dismissed this to us.

63
Q

Well, shouldn't they have the chance to do it

first?
MR. PARKER;

I don't see that there is any need for

it, Your Honor.
Q

Well, it would require us to make some deal in

the first instance with this record, in terms of whether you
can be distinguished from the ofchcir parties.
MR. PARKER; Well, I think that, on the basis of the
briefs alone, that will appear, Your Honor.

I wouldn't

expect the Court to be troubled —•
Q

How many thousands of pages were there?

MR. PARKER;

There are 12,000, and I would not

expect the Court to be troubled by that.
Q

Thanks 1

[Laughter.]
MR. PARKER; But I respectfully submit, Your Honor,
that on the basis of the briefs alone this will appear.
the facts are there, they are uncontroverted.

Because

And I think what

is most important of all, Your Honor, is —
Q

Does Mr. Bauman concede that?

MR. PARKER; Does he concede what I say?
Q

Yes.

MR. PARKER;

I have not asked him, Your Honor, and

I don't know.
We respectfully submit, Your Honor, that what is

64
before Your Honors, and what Your Honors will be willing to
consider, that you will see that there has been a grave
injustice committed here in respect of Bankers Life, And that
the only way left to remedy the injustice of having made
Bankers Life a party to an action in which it does not belong
is to affirm dismissal of the complaint as to it, and thereby,
in some measure, offset the effects of the unworthy challenge
to the integrity of Bankers Life in connection with a perfectly
proper sale of the Manhattan stock which it made.
Thank you very much, Your Honors.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Bauman, do you —

I thought there was some question pending to you that was going
to be picked up.

Perhaps I am mistaken.

MR. BAUMAN:

I think p€;rhaps I did it after the

luncheon recess, Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think that was the

one —
MR. BAUMAN:

At least I attempted to.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think that was the one

I was carrying in mind that there was a question pending.
MR. BAUMAN:

If there is an outstanding question, I

will be happy to try to answer it.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

No questions?
MR. BAUMAN?

Thank you, sir.

65

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
MR. BAUMAN:

Th® case is submit’.ted.

Before we leave, Mr. Chief Justice, I

don’t know whether or not Mr. Justice Stewart asked, about
outstanding claims and the amounts of outstanding claims, if
in fact he didf I will be happy to reply very briefly? if he
didn’t, I shall leave quietly.
Q

Well, it's been insisted on the other side that

this record doesn’t show the existence of any creditors whose
claims have been unsatisfied.
j

MR. BAUMAN; And we said in our Reply Brief that we’ll
prove it at the trial.

But I do want to assure the Court

and the Deputy Superintendent of Insurance of the State is
standing next to me — that claims do exist, and some exceeding
over a million and a half dollars, which will not be paid under
the present circumstances,
Q

Well, you could have put that in during the

depositions, couldn't you?
MR. BAUMAN:

We did not go into the question of —

perhaps we should have; we did not go into th® question of
damages.
Q

Is this a public record, the New York liquida­

tion proceedings?
MR. BAUMAN:

I would be sure that's true.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, gentlemen.
[Whereupon, at 2sl0 p.m., the case was submitted.]
