P R 0 C E E DING S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We'll hear arguments

first this morning in No.. 71-41, International Union of
Operating Engineers against Flair Builders.
Mr. Baum, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD M. BAUM, ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BAUM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court :
Thig case involves an action brought under Section
301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, requesting the
enforcement of a demand for arbitration.

The complaint, as

amended, was dismissed by the district court which found that,
although the company in this case was bound to the collective
bargaining agreement to arbitrate labor disputes within the
scope of that agreement, that it was unenforcible since the
union was gjailty of laches.
On appeal, the decision of the district court was
affirmed, Judge Stevens dissenting.
Thereafter, the Fourth Circuit rendered a decision
in which it held that laches should be a question for the
arbitrator and not for the court, and specifically disagreed
with the case at bar.
Accordingly, the issue which we have presented to
this Court is whether, once a court has determined that a

labor dispute is arbitrable under the terms of a contract,
should the issue of laches or the question of delay be
determined by the arbitrator or the court.
In this regard, what occurred in this case before
the district court is most pertinent to a determination of this
issue.
On May 22nd, 1964, the union and the employer entered
into a memorandum of agreement which bound the company and the
union to a master agreement, which had been negotiated between
the union and an employer association.

The memorandum of

agreement provided that the company would be bound to the
initial master agreement and also subsequent master agreements
unless they terminated at the time that the first agreement
was expiring, or any subsequent agreement.
Now, the initial agreement -*- the memorandum, as I
said, was signed on May 22nd, 1964.

The initial master agree­

ment expired on May 31st, 1966, and thereafter, on June 1st, a
new agreement cam© into effect, which was to expire on May 31
of 1970.
Now# in this regard again, I should note to the
Court that there is no issue in this case, that the district
court found that there was a binding agreement between the
parties, and there was no issue on appeal regarding the
binding nature of the agreement.

The issue cams as to the

decision of the question of laches.

5

Now, during the course of the second agreement, or
approximately on November 7th, 1968, we filed a complaint with
the district court, requesting, pursuant to Section 301,
stating that the employer had disregarded the agreement, had
refused to pay the wages and conditions under the agreement,
and, further, had refused to comply with the hiring arrange­
ments which were under the contract.
We asked in that case for a specific performance of
the agreement
Q

This involved one employee, didn't it?

MR, BAUM:

Well, at that point there had only been

one employee —
Q

One position,

MR, BAUM: At that point.

It involved an operating

engineer, right.
Q

One employee, one position,

MR. BAUM;

Right.

Oi: course our contention, Your Honor, is that there
were several other employees that would have been in the
bargaining unit during the course of this agreement had the
employer complied.

And I think that’s one of the very funda­

mental issues in the arbitration.
New, what happened here was that the district court
dt

I think that the threshold issue should be determined .

by the arbitrator under the terms of this contract, and I

shouldn’t decide it.
So we went ahead and — this was in April of *68,
where the master agreement still had 13 months to run —- and,
pursuant to the court directive, made a demand on the company
for arbitration of the contract issue and, in addition, made a
demand for the; other issues, arbitration of the other issues
which had bean set forth in the complaint.
The counsel for the company then filed a motion to
dismiss, alleging laches as a defense.

The district court then

held that laches was an issue for the arbitrator and not for
the court, under this Court’s decision in Wiley.
Thereafter, the court ordered a hearing on the merits
of the case, limited to the issue of whether or not there was
a contract, the threshold question.

As a matter of fact, during

the course of the hearing, the district court again stated its
position that the i&sue of laches was for the arbitrator and
not for the court, and further stated that it found that a
binding collective bargaining agreement was in existence.
However, at the conclusion of the hearing, the
court rendered a memorandum of opinion, in which it now founds
Yes, there was a binding contract, but that the union was
guilty of laches in terms of its bringing the action and
accordingly it was unenforcible.
Now, at the hearing, we in fact never had a specific
hearing on the question of laches because of the court’s

7
position that that was hot an issue for it to determine, and
.in far,t when the employer raised the issue at the hearing, the
court attempted to limit our cross-examination of the employer
— the employer in the case, who was obviously the company's
chief witness — to five minutes.

Because he had already

engaged in e. long colloquy with counsel for the company,
pointing out that the only thing he was interested in was the
terminant, the binding nature of the contract.
So that 1 don’t feel that other than the question of
the contract itself there are any other significant facts?
there was some evidence, from the union's point of view, that
there had been contacts, the employer denied any contacts
during the term of the contract, and the court, in changing
its position from the position which it had held during the
hearing, from the position it had held in its memorandum,
not permitting counsel's motion to dismiss under Wiley case,
that he was crediting the company's testimony regarding laches,
even thpugh, frankly, we had had no hearing on laches.
Now, I think in terms of the argument in this case
there are three essential considerations which the Court must
make.

Our position is, first, that the defense of laches

clearly falls within the rationale of this Court's decision
in Wiley, as particularly illustrated by what happened before
the district court.
The district court initially said the threshold issue

8
of the contract existence was for the arbitrator.

We then

followed the court’s admonition and demanded arbitration and,
in fact, as the court indicates in its subsequent memo on the
.................. ........................................................
f

motion to dismiss, we pointed out to the court that this Court
had stated that the threshold issue was in fact for the court
and not the arbitrator, and subsequently did determine that
threshold issue as a binding contract.
The court then said laches wasn't for the court but
for the arbitrator, and then changed its position.
what happened?

Wow,

Caches is an equitable defense, obviously,

at common law? it has two elements.

Normally it would have

the question of delay and also a question of prejudice.
There was no testimony taken on the issue of
prejudice, and there was very little testimony other than the
question of delay here.
New, frankly, had the court said to us: "I am going
to determine the issue of lache3 in this case/ what we would
have done is to have presented our case on the merits.
Because here we had an.employer with a continuing violation
of the contract, that it had disregarded it since the first
employee had become a member of the union»

We had a situation

where the employer had refused to pay the wages and working
conditions and had simply ignored the contract.
So obviously we would have had to present our entire
case on the vorits.

We would have subpoenaed the company books

and records, to determine what employees were involved.
Because obviously this would relate to a defense in this kind
of a case.
In other words, it would have been — this hearing,
in fact, took less than two hours.

Had the court said we're

going to have a hearing cn the issue of laches, it would have
taken two or three days.
Q

Mr. Baum, as I read your petition, the only

question you present is the issue of whether the question of
laches is one for the court or one for the —
MR. BAUMj Right.

q

-- arbitrator.

MR. BAUM:

No, sir.

going beyond that at all.

Are you going beyond that?
No, Your Honor.

I am not

I’m making the point that what

happens -- in the Wllev decision this Court said, set forth
four reasons why they felt that issues of delay should go to
the arbitrator and not to the court.
They said, first of all, it’s very difficult to
separate an issue of delay from"the issue of merits.

I'm

pointing out that, frankly, had we had to go into the issue of
delay, which here was called laches, it could have been called
waiver, you could have called it. procedural delay, we would
have been required to go into a long and lengthy hearing on
the merits.

And the Court points out in Wiley where there is

an ugrec-v.asnt to arbitrate the issues, the federal courts should

10
not get into this issue* they have enough of a caseload as it
is, the parties have agreed to utilise this forum and
obviously this should be a decision of the arbitrator, because
of the inability to separate the issue of laches from the
merits of the case.
And I think that is .the reason I’m making the point,
Q

Would you say, Mr. Baum, that the concept of

laches might be different in the context of the labor contract
and labor disputes than in the lav; of equity generally?
MR. BAUM:

I think that’s true, and I think it

would — the law, obviously, in the question of common law, the
law of equity, the defense of laches always relates to the
facts of the particular case.
Now, in this case not only do you have to worry about
the facts of the particular case, but you have a bargaining
relationship to be concerned with, you have a continuing problei
of violation of a bargaining relationship, because, as I
pointed cut to the court before, when the demand for arbitration was made, we still had 13 months to run in the contract.
So that even if there might be some question of delay,
which might affect the ultimate decision of the arbitrator,
there certainly could be no question of delay as it related
to the final 13 months of the collective bargaining agreement.
Now, I think the second consideration in this case
would foe the effect on the federal courts if

were to get

Ii
into a situation where courts are going to Rtart determining
questions of delay.

Every time a party to a collective-

bargaining agreement wanted to disrupt that relationship;, the
simplest thing they could do, would be to start raising these

defensos»
Obviously, the purpose of arbitration, at least in
labor-management, and I would assume in commercial matters,
is that there is a forum which can expedite the hearing and
that the parties have this kind of relationship.

It's the

manner which they choose.
And if we. start raising defenses, whether it be
waiver or estoppel, or we call it procedural delay, or we
call it laches, it’s still delay, any way,

we’re going to

start delaying the process of arbitration; and any party that
wants to delay the process of arbitration- can do it simply by
raising these types of defenses.

1 think this Court, in its decisions starting with
textile Workers, going through the Steelworkers Trilogy, going
through the recent decision in Boys Markets, and going through
all Of these cases is the theory that where the parties have
agreed and they are going to arbitrate the case, wa don’t want
that kind of issue in the federal court, that should be
determined by an arbitrator.

And that is exactly what we are

talking about in this particular case.
New, the third element, I think, that the Court must

12
seriously look at is the question of the quid pro quo.

1 noted

in reading this Court's* decision in the Boys Markets cose, that,
one of the points which the Court made was that the reason that
they thought that an injunction should issue and that Sinclair
should be overruled was the fact that the employer would have
to have an effective system of making arbitration work, and
that damages were not always th© answer.
And it pointed out that where there in an agreement
to arbitrate, and then you permit a strike, you are delegating
the need for the employer to enter into an agreement which
provides for arbitration, because you are saying that the
arbitration procedure is meaningless.

Now, let's turn that

around and let's put the foot in the other shoe from the union's
point of view.
The union basically has a right to strike.
an economic weapon.

That is the weapon it utilises.

That is
Now,

'when you take that weapon and you say to the union s Give that
weapon up during the term of the contract, we want industrial
peace.

But we will substitute for that the process of arbitra­

tion .
tod then you make that process one that is ineffective
just as in the case of Boys Markets, on the employer's side,
where you turn it around to the union's side, it makes it
ineffective.

Obviously, I think, the guld pro quo for no

strike ir arbitration, it is not litigation in the federal

13
courts»
Now, in addition, if I might return the court for a
moment to the issues raised, the considerations in Wiley»
This Court pointed out in Wiley that in addition to the
problem of separating the merit from the procedural issue we
had a question of delay»

This case is over three years old»

It has not yet come before the arbitrator.
This Court raised the question in Wiley of the cost»
As 1 pointed out in the brief, that I think this case so
appropriately supports this Court’s rationale in Wiley, counsel
for the company advised this Court, after it had granted
certiorari, that the company didn’t have money to prepare a
brief in this case, and w® pointed out that could have happened
just as well to the union and the company because here the
company says they don't have enough money to take this case
to the highest court? we didn't raise the defense of laches,
either.
But the cost factor can work either way,
Court pointed out in Wiley, this is correct»

And as the

This is exactly

what happened in this case»
Now, in addition, the Court in Wiley also talked
about the question of duplication of effort.

Had the district

court followed through on its original decision that laches
was for the arbitrator and not for the court, then counsel for
the company could have easily raised the issue of delay before

14
the arbitrator, irrespective of what we call its

whether we

call it laches, whether we call it estoppel, whether we call
it waiver.
Obviously, I think that this particular case falls
clearly within the four corners of this Court's decision in
Wiley.

Arbitration, frankly, is a process which, if it does

not work or does not operate, really serves no purpose.
Now, getting back for a moment to the question of
the no-strike provision in this contract, it is interesting to
note that under the terms of this particular contract the union
had a right to strike if the employer did not pay the wages
and did not pay the fringe benefits.

We could have proceeded

under arbitration or vre could have struck.

Yet we chose not

to strike the employer in this particular case and we chose to
go the route of arbitration and not create any kind of an
industrial tie-up, so that I think the facts of this particular
contract, the facts of this particular case, show that not
only did we have a broad arbitration clause, but as to some
of the issues raised in arbitration we could have used the
right to strike, we had an option, but rather wa chose
arbitration because we did not want to, in any way, affect the
relationship.

1

So that creates even an additional policy reason why,
in this particular case, delay is an issue for the arbitrator
and not for the court.

15
Q

Mr. Baum, I understand that the first breach

is alleged to have occurred in 1965«
MR. BAUM:
Q

That is right.

Then why did the union wait three years before

commencing arbitration proceedings?
MR. BAUM:

I think that the fact, what little facts

there are, Mr. Justice Powell, in this case, was the fact that
we waited until we had a concrete situation on which to move.
Cur position is that for the years 1964 through 1966, the
work was subcontracted to a subcontractor, which obviously
would be an issue in the arbitration? that in 1S67 there was a
tremendous turnover of people.

However, in 1968, we found the

operator, he joined the union and, I think as the record
reflects, we filed an action before the National Labor Relations
Board which was successfully concluded, as well as the Wage
and Hour against the employer, and we looked for a concrete
situation.
This was a continuing violation, and we were waiting
until we had a type of a concrete situation.
Now, I might also add this:

that, irrespective of

fchsi question of even what happened between 1966 and 368, which,
ftahkly, I think is a question of fact on the merits, we don’t
have all the merits and all the facts before us, there can be
no question that from the time that we filed the notice of
arbitration, that being from 1968 until the conclusion of the

16
contract there could be no issue of delay, it might foe, frankly,
that an arbitrator might take the position that because we
waited for those years there might not be any remedial thing
that he could do in terms of back pay, but obviously that would
have to come out in terms of all the facts in this ease,
fuid we don't have all the facts in this case before us, and
that really creates the problem,
1 might ask the Chief Justice if 1 could reserve five
minutes for rebuttal.
MR, CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

You may, Mr, Baum,

Mr, Murphy,
ORAL ARGUMENT OP J. ROBERT MURPHY, ESQ.,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, IN SUPPORT OF JUDGMENT BELOW
MR. MURPHY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Courts
X think that as we have suggested in our brief on
this appeal, the inclination of the petitioner, the union, has
been actually to define the issue' of this case in a broader
sense than they purport to be defining it.
It is true that we would differ with them
substantially on their interpretation of the activities and
■proceedings in the court below.

We find no place in the

actual proceedings in the trial court where the union was in
any way prejudiced or surprised by what happened.

But in their

brief they constantly reiterate that the trial court found that

17
the parties were bound by an agreement to arbitrate.

The

trial court never so found.
An examination of each one of the orders entered by
the trial court, whether on the initial motion to dismiss
against the original complaint, which, by the way, was not
seeking arbitration and was filed by the union for a completely
different purpose, but on that motion order on the motion to
dismiss the amended complaint and on the final order of the
trial court there has not been a finding of fact that could be
considered final and binding, that the parties were ever bound.
Xt would foe accurate to say that the trial court
indicated that there was an agreement signed, yes; but, whether
or not it was binding at the time of the action was the
threshold question which had to be determined by the trial
court and which was determined by the trial court on the facts
as it heard it adversely to the union.
Now, on a narrow approach to this case wo would
think that this would be adequate and fully supported by the
decisions of this Court in Wiley v. Livingston, in the Lincoln
Hills case, the Steelworkers Trilogy, and the entire series of
cases which have set up the distinction between those matters
which an arbitrator will be considered to have jurisdiction
to decide and those matters involving the threshold question
which the trial court, under Section 301, will have the right
to decide.

18
Biit the union in this case is not restricting itself
to this harrow issue.

It seems to us that they are going

further and basically asking, under the guise of limiting their
argument to the question of who gets to decree whether laches
is a defense, but they are going further and suggesting that
this Court should recommend to trial courts, in the incidence
of 301 cases, that they should have nothing but a cursory
inquiry into whether or not there is or is not a binding
contract,
Q

I take it you agree, counsel, that it's the

general policy of the court's to encourage arbitration in this
area, would you not?
MR. MURPHY:
yes.

I would agree with that. Your Honor,

But in so agreeing I would have to point out that in all

of the cases from the Lincoln Mills throuqh the Steelworkers
and so on there has never been any question but what the trial
court in 301 cases must, as a matter of judicial responsibility
find that there is a binding agreement before it can order
arbitration.
Now, in'the footnotes of the Steelworkers case, Mr.
Justice Douglas’s opinion specifically pointed out that if it
>

were alleged that there was a contract ’which in effect said
that the arbitrator should decide his own jurisdiction, that
he would require that the party so alleging has the burden of
saying that.

19
So that there has never really been more than what
you could call a presumption of arbitrability, resulting from
the Steelworkers lines of casea.

And we can accept that

presumption, but in so accepting it, Your Honor, we do not
mean to suggest that the Court does not have its own preliminary
and primary obligation.
Q '

Well, assuming that the parties were bound by

a collective bargaining contract, and that it did have an
arbitration clause in it, that's the way the case comes to us,
it seems to me the arbitration clause here was an all-disputes
clause, wasn't it?
MR. MURPHY s

X would have to- admit that that is what

it appears to be, Your Honor, —
Q

So we're not dealing with an arbitration clause

that limits the arbitrator to the interpretation, the application of the — {inaudible; overlapping voices].
MR. MURPHY:
Q

No, we are not, Your Honor.

What, you:!re saying is that in this specific

case the parties, the employer didn’t have to arbitrate because
of laches.

It wasn't that — assuming there was a valid

collective bargaining contract, it wasn't that something had
happened to terminate the contract, or the general application
.of the arbitration clause?
MR. MURPHY:

Mo, Your Honor, it does not involve the

interpretation of the arbitration clause, because we are

20
departing from —
Q

Or its on-going binding character.

It’s just

in this particular dispute.
MR. MURPHY:

It’s exactly the on-going binding

character that we have challenged, and that in this particular
case -~
Q

Well, that isn’t the issue in this 'Court, is it,

whether the contract as © whole and the arbitration clause is
binding on the employer. That’s not the issue here, is it?
MR. MURPHY: We see that as the issue, Your Honor, and
we have seen that as the issue from the first time that we
filed a pleading in this case.
Q

Well, you’re perhaps entitled to support the

judgment on any ground that’s available to you, but that would
require some factual determinations here in this Court.
MR. MURPHY:

Wot in this Court, Your Honor, we don’t

feel it would? yes, require factual determinations in the trial
court.

But we can see very little difference between this

situation and a situation that might be presented if the
parties had torn up the contract.
Q
matter down.

Well, let’s just, for the moment, narrow this
Let’s assume for the moment that there is no

dispute whatsoever, that both parties had signed and ware bound
by th© contract, and that the arbitration clause in the
contract was an all-disputes clause.

Nov?, let’s start from that

21
preraise? for a moment.
MR. MURPHY:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

How, how about laches?

When, in a specific case,

the claim is that the arbitration clause is inoperative because
the union has been guilty of laches, and it’s an all-disputes
clause.

How, here's a dispute between the parties as to

whether or not the arbitration clause covers this dispute.
Nov;, that’s the narrow issue in the case —• at least
it's one of them.
MR. MURPHY:

If there were the issue of this case,

Your Honor, I would concede that the question of laches in that,
instance was a matter for the arbitrator, and I don't think that
you would find any different indication in the opinion below.
But that is not the situation in this case.
Excuse me, Your Honor.
Q

What relief did the plaintiff ask for, in

going .into the trial court?

MR. MURPHY:

When ha went into the trial court, he

was asking for many-fchousand dollars damage, and for a direction
I believe, that the employer be required to comply with the
contract, in which particular manner he did not specify, and
it was only in the amended complaint when he finally suggested
that arbitration v;as the remedy .that he was after.
Q

Well, taking the amended complaint, which

certainly we must take now — I'm sure you agree?

22

MR. MURPHY<;
Q

Yes, we will, Your Honor.

Wasn’t that a suit in equity for specific,

performance of an arbitration clause?
MR. MURPHY:
Q

Yes, it was, Your Honor.

But you suggest that in that specific — that

effort to get specific enforcement, the claim of waiver or
laches is not part of the total controversy?
MR. MURPHY;

Oh, I suggest that it is a part of the

total controversy, but it's the part of the total controversy
that must be decided by the court.
Q

Then what is the purpose of the arbitration

clause, an•all-disputes clause, if the court is to reach in and
decide some and leave others for the arbitration?
MR. MURPHY:

The question of laches in this

particular case. Your Honor, goes to the binding force of the
contract.

And I cannot concede in any way that there was, at

the time that this case reached the court, in any way a binding
contract? because, under the circumstances, there was no longer
a binding contract.

It is only by a misinterpretation of the

facts that counsel for the union can possibly say that there
was a binding Contract or that the court below found one.
0

Mr. Murphy.

MR. MURPHY;
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

On page 149 of the Appendis?., as I read Judge

Decker's opinion, at the top of the page there, he says:

'Accordingly, I have deter

l.that defendant, was bound by

the Esrsoranclum agreement to arbitrate labor disputes within
the limits of the arbitration clause.”
In order to sustain this contention that you’ve just
been making, you have to urge the overturning of the district
court’s finding on that point, don’t you?
MR. MURPHYs

I.would have to say that that clause in

Judge Decker's opinion was a part, a finding of fact, if you
will, Your Honor, yes, but it was not his ultimate holding.
He was not saying that "I hold that somebody who has once been
bound is no longer bound", except that he came to the
conclusion that it just wasn't a binding contract any more.
He may have used the words, and he did use the words
that Your Honor has quoted; that is correct.
May I? Your Honors, make one additional reflection
concerning what we are saying here.

And that is that v?hile

it would possibly have been permissible to take the contrary
approach in the trial court, and to say that since there once
was a contract that was signed, we’re going to leave everything
•that ever happened after that to the arbitrator, it seems
equally clear to me that,in view of the decision of this Court
in Boys Markets, that that approach is no longer permissible.
And I say this for what I feel are important policy
reasons.

In the Boys Markets case it was being the relief

which was being sought was basically an injunction against a

24
strike.

The impression that this Court gives in the Boys

Markets opinion is that where an anti-strike injunction is being
sought the function of the trial court under Section 3C1 is
to take an active part in the investigation of this threshold
question# as to whether there is or is not a binding contract
and. a binding arbitration clause a part of it, and it would
seem to us that if that is the approach to be taken under the
Boys Markets decision, it is impossible to rationalize a waiver,
a more cursive approach in a case where it is not being -v;here an injunction is not being sought but where only relief
that is being sought is in the type of arbitration that is
being sought by the plaintiff's amended complaint here.
We can see no reason why there should be any
distinction in the importance that the trial court is to give
to that preliminary investigation of the threshold question.
So it would be our feeling that, as a result of the
Boya Markets decision, this Court must avoid enunciating a
double standard which might possibly work an inequity between

the parties.

If there is to be one standard when an injunction

is sought, and a contrary and lass stringent standard whan
all that is being sought is arbitration, it seems to us that
there is no way to put these together and avoid confusion in
the trial courts''or even to make an exorabie arrangement
between the parties.
What if both types of relief are being sought in the

25
same proceeding?

And, after all, in the injunction situation,

which you are directly confronted with in the Boys Markets
case, we are ordered, the trial courts are ordered to direct
the employer to arbitrate at the same time.
Now, in those situations are wo to make one standard
of inquiry into whether or not there is a binding contract and
than later, in the same case, make a different standard of
inquiry?
Q

Well, your point must be that the Court of Appeals

decision on laches was that laches and delay had terminated the
entire contract, it just isn’t that there had been too much
delay in this case to force arbitration.

There was no longer

a binding contract of any kind?
MR, MURPHY: That would b® the effect of the decision
of the Court of Appeals ~~
Q

But is that your position?

MR. MURPHY:
Q

Yas, Your Honor.

Whereas, if you — you a while ago conceded that

if it were only a question of .'Leches and the applicability
of the arbitration clausa in this specific instance, conceding
that the contract, in the arbitration clause, continued
generally —
MR. MURPHY:
Q

Yes.

—- you had conceded that then laches would be

a question for the arbitrator under an all-disputes clause?

26
MR, MURPHY:
Q

That’s correct., Your "Honor.

But where laches, you say, as the Court of Appeal

used it, went to the validity and the existence of the entire
contract —
MR. MURPHY:
Q

Exactly, Your Honor.

---- then laches has to foe for the court.

MR. MURPHY:

Right.

That is our position, and, by

the way, that was the position of the Fourth Circuit in the
Tobacco Workers case, on which petitioner relies.

They made

a specific distinction between the type of laches that would
go to the matters, as they said, which are to be decided by
the court and the type of laches which go to the matters to be
decided by the arbitrator.

So, if that is the distinction

of the Fourth Circuit, as we pointed out in our brief, we think
the Fourth Circuit would have decided this particular case
exactly the way our Seventh Circuit decided it.
Because there are apparently two different kinds of
laches, as Your Honor has pointed out.

One which goes to the

heart of the matter.
Vie think also that, going back to the position of
the Boys Markets, decision, it is necessary to have a uniform
standard of inquiry for the court to avoid the rather
embarrassing and inequitable situation which could arise
where there are patters that are obviously somewhat outside
the scope of arbitration and to avoid these cases where the

27

arbitrator's decision or award might even end up in what the
court would consider matters of illegality.
Let us suppose that the trial court has ordered
arbitration after a cursory inquiry as to whether or not there

is a binding arbitration clause and the arbitrator, in turn,
decides that- he has no jurisdiction?

Now, that might be only

a matter of slight import in the ordinary case, but if you're
in a case where you're also asking for an injunction against
the strike, what you have ended up with is giving the employer
an anti-strike injunction and not giving the union the
arbitration that it wants.

Which could be a very damaging

case for the union, and X would think that

counsel representing

the union would almost be on our side in this interpretation
of the Soys Markets decision.
Q

Wall, if he saw the case the way you do, why, 1

am sure he would bo,
MR. MURPHY:

[Laughing]

Ygs, Your Honor.

I believe that I can sum up my position, and I hope
that I have made myself clear as to my understanding of the
effect of the decisions below by saying that in our viewpoint
the decisions below are well within the scope of the prior
labor lav; that this Court has fashioned since the Lincoln
Mills decision.

The purpose of the Court in fashioning this

labor law has been constantly reiterated by saying that the
aim is to promote industrial peace? the aim, yes, to promote

28
industrial peace through the use of the arbitration process
as a central institution in that promotion of industrial peace but never, never at the expense of saying that the arbitration
process is self-operating.

It won’t operate.

An arbitration

award could hardly be valid or worthwhile if it could not be
enforced by the Court,
Since the Boys Markets decision, it seems to us that
unless this Court is to suggest to the trial court that they
should vary the principle according to the remedy that is being
sought, it is necessary to require of the trial court in any
case under Section 301 that the court take an active position
in arriving at the decision as to the threshold question.

It

must actively investigate whether there is a binding contract,
it must actively investigate whether or not that binding contract
is still binding at the time of incidence in the court, and
actively investigate the scope of the arbitration clause.
If there is no active investigation, there will be
contradictory opinions, there will be confusion in the trial
court, we will achieve one thing that the Boys Markets desired,
the opinion the Boys Markets seem to have desired, and that was
to reinforce the remaining use of state courts in Section 301
cases, and it would be that possible reinforcement from a
uniform standard, which we are suggesting, that would be our
answer to the suggestion that perhaps we're giving the federal
court too much to do, that we’re adding to their workload.

29
We feel that if a uniform standard is to be promoted
by the decision in the case before the bar today, that that
uniform standard will reinforce the availability of the
conventional State court remedies an was said in the Boys
U.

Markets case, that should be reinforced so that those State
court remedies which Congress apparently desired to keep
available will be available.
Q

Mr. Murphy, you certainly stated correctly that

the objective of arbitration clausas is to promote industrial
peace.

That's,the objective, though, isn’t it, and vc is not

the means, the function of an arbitration clause to provide a
simple and a speedy solution?
MR. MURPHY:

Yes, it is aimed at this, Your Honor.

Q
Now, does the approach taken in this case
there’3
suggest that/any very speedy solution to this controversy?
MR. MURPHY:

Looking at the facts of this case, Your

Honor, the speedy solution of arbitration was available to this
union five years before it first suggested that speedy
solution.

There was not an on-going employer-union relation­

ship which ought to be the minimum condition for effective
collective bargaining, and the arbitration which is a part of
it.

This situation was one where there was no relationship-

between these parties, and if we consider that as a part of the
facts,which it obviously was on the proofs of both parties in
the trial court, it would fos impossible to say that to order

30
arbitration in this matter, when they finally asked for it#
would have contributed in any way to industrial peace.

That

is the reason we have suggested in our brief that a part of
speedy resolution of disputes should certainly be the avail­
ability of the judicial part of the relief.

But it would

hardly have been up to the employer to go and suggest it when
he had no union on the horizon for a period of five years
after the memorandum of agreement was signed.
I hope I'm not going around the periphery of Your
Honor's question# but I'm trying to say that while everyone
realizes and hopes that arbitration will continue as an
effective part of the collective bargaining process# that in
some cases# and this one. is an unusual one, we would have to
concede# in some cases arbitration will not contribute to that
and the ordering of arbitration in some cases # as was pointed
out in Wiley v. Livingston# would foe imposing upon the parties
something which they have not agreed to.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you# Mr. Murphy.
Mr. Baum, do you have anything further?
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD M. BAUM# ESQ.#
ON behalf of the petitioner
MR. BAUM:

Mr. Chief Justice# just a couple of

comments that I wish to address to the Court.
X think Mr. Justice Rehnquist was correct when he

noted the decision of the district court at page 149 of the

31
abstract, holding that there was a contract but that the
question was of laches.
1 would also suggest to the Court that they examine
page 93 of the abstract, where the court, during the hearing,
specifically stated that he held that the agreement came into
existence and held that there was an agreement.
2 would further, suggest to the Court that they
examine page 156 of the abstract, being the Court of Appeals*
decision in this ease,! In which they say their issue is the
question of whether a party to a collective bargaining agrement,
which contains an arbitration clause, may be so dilatory in
making the existence of a vaguely

delineated dispute known

to the other party that a court is justified in refusing to
compel the submission.
The point is, you can’t get to the issue of laches
unless you first have a contract.

Because why would you want

to reach the issue of laches unless you first have a contract?
If you have no binding contract, there is no issue to reach.
And I think that counsel is incorrect —
Q

What would you say if the claim made by an

employer in resisting arbitration was that we have orally
rescinded the contract?
clause any more.

There is no contract, no arbitration

Wouldn't the court have to determine, as the

threshold question, whether there is a contract and an arbitration
clause?

32
MR. BMJMs The Court has to determine whether there
exists an agreement, obviously.

Whether the parties have

entered into a written agreement.

Of course, they’d probably

get into, like in this case, we have an entire agreement of the
parties clause, which says there car» be no oral agreements or
understandings.

So that here the written agreement is the

binding agreement.
But obviously you have to decide that question.

You

can’t get to the issue ~~ why get to the issue of laches, if
you don’t have & contract in the first place?

You say you

don't have a contract, we've nothing to arbitrate.

You have

nothing to enforce.
Q
though?

Isn’t that the district judge’s approach here,

He said, t!I can go along on this being an arbitrable

question if you have got a contract."

But we’re talking

about a matter which goes to the very present existence of the
contract.
So that was —
MR. BAUM: Well, he cays, as Justice Rehnquist referred
"According,! have determined that defendant was bound by the
memorandum agreement to arbitrate labor disputes within the
limits of the arbitration clause.”
And then he says, However, I’m not going to enforce
this provision becasue I believe that the union was guilty of
1achea here.

33

This becomes a very complicated situation because,
moreover# this wasn't an industrial case, this is a construction
union, and the limited facts in the record show this is on
construction sites, several sections, this is the major issue
which would have to be determined in this case *
relationship?

What kind of

This isn't where you have a steward every day

in a plant, this is construction, there are several counties,
there are several sites, business agents are going around,
there isn't this kind of a situation that you'd have in an Indus
trial plent? obviously an arbitrator is going to determine these
kinds of questions because that was one of the issues we would
have had to get into if the court in fact had held a hearing
on laches here.

We'd have to do it before an arbitrator.

And obviously it becomes part of the merits.
Moreover, I would point out to the Court on© final
thing, counsel says that the Tobacco Workers case says that
there are different kinds of laches.

I would suggest, and

I think a reading of the Tobacco Workers case directly says,
We disagree with the Seventh Circuit, we think —- they say
the Flair Builders case, as far as the Fourth Circuit is
concerned, is wrong. They say the issue should have been for
the arbitrator and not for the court»

And there is no

question, they don't delineate as to different kinds of
laches, that laches is the way, it's waiver, it's procedural
daisyo

X submit that there is no difference, and I submit

34
that if this Court is going to permit these kinds of issues
to be decided by the courts rather than the arbitrator, where
you have an all-disputes arbitration clause, what you’re going
to get into is more litigation and undermine the arbitration
process.
Thank you.

m. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Baum.
Thank you, Mr, Murphy.
