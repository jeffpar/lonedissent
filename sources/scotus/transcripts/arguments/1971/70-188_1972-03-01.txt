MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in No. 70-186, Wright against the City of Emporia.
Mr. Tucker, you may proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL W. TUCKER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. TUCKERt

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This case was commenced on March 15, 1965, before the
City of Emporia came into being.

The litigation was litigation

against the County School Board of Greensville County to
require desegregation of the public schools it operated as a
bi-rocial school system for the entire county, including what
then was th© town of Emporia.
At that time, all of the county’s white children
attended the schools located in Emporia, there were two such
schools:

one, the Emporia Elementary School? ons, the Greens­

ville County High School.

Both of which were located in the

town of Emporia as it was at that time, and they were the only
schools which white children in the county attended.
In other words, children who lived in the county
crossed the line to attend —■ white children that lived in the
county crossed the line to attend schools in the city.
Seme of the Negro children, the eLementary children,
who lived in the city crossed the lines to attend schools out—

4
. out in the scanty? oil the negro high school children who
7

crossed the line to attend schools in the

county.
There was just one. school system, and as far as the
school system was concerned there were no political lines.
Q

There was a Negro school in the city also?

MR. TUCKERe There was one Negro school in the city,
which had been the old high school or the training school
doubling as hioh school and elementary school.

And, as far

as the high school was concerned, it was replaced by a new
school in 1953? 1 believe it was; built about a mile north of
the town.
Q

What part of Virginia is this county in?

MR. TUCKER:

Greensville County is on the North

Carolina line, it’s just about 10 or 20 miles north of
Halifax County which was just being spoken about.
Q

Yes.

Q

So it53 apparently close to Scotland Neck, then?

MR. TUCKER:

It's quite close to Scotland Neck, yes.

After four years of litigation, we prevailed upon the
District Court to require a plan that would promise real —
to desegregate the schools.

The essence of the plan was one

that was proposed by the plaintiffs, and that was to assign
certain grades to certain schools, and assign children,
whether they lived in the city or in the county, to the grade

K

served in that particular school.
Specifically of interest here, .

all the children

in grades lf 2, and 3 were assigned to the Emporia Elementary
School in Emporia, that being the traditionally whits elementary
school; and ell children in grades 10, 11, and 12 ware
assigned to the Greensville County High School in Emporia,
that h&veing been the traditional white school? and all the
children in those intermediate grades were assigned to the
previously all-folsck schools in accordance with the grades
that those schools served.
How, immediately after the District Court gave
approval to this plan, the city of Emporia decided it would
take over the two traditionally white schools and operate them
as a separate school system.
And. the Court of Appeals has held, reversing the
District Court, that this should have been permitted.
Q

ha you say it was a town, and it became a city?

MR, TUCKER: Became a city while this case was pending.
0

Right.

MR. TUCKER:
Q

And this —
Which 1 don’t think —

That didn’t happen automatically, just when it

readied a certain size?
MR. TUCKER:
Q

Well, they had to apply for it.

It took action by the ■— by the —

MR, TUCKERS

In the local court, to show that they

had reached this population provided —

It hctd to have a population of 5,000 before

Q

they could —
MR, TUCKER;

It really doesn't make any difference,

because as a town they could have operated a separate school
system if they had wanted to.
Q

Oh., they cor.id have?

ME. TUCKER5

They could have.

There are towns in Virginia that have separate school
systems»
Now, we think that ~
Q

But under Virginia law, when a municipality

becomes a city, then governmentally it changes? then it's
no longer part of the county, is it?

MR, TUCKER;

It*s not a ~~ it’s politically

independent of the county, that’s true.

Q

Right. And when it’s a town, it's not
r

politically independent?
MR, TUCKER;

It’s not politically independent? that’s

correct,
Q

Yes.

MR* TUCKER;

How, we think the Court of Appeals

readied its judgment through unfortunate distortions of the
evidence.

So we are compelled to discuss the evidence at quite

some length, because we wouldn't like the same thing to happen

7
here.
And first we511 start with sort of an overview of
the county, and the area.
The longest — it’s e small county, only 312 or so
square miles0

The longest straight-line distance, whether you

measure from east to west or whether you measure from north to
south, is — north to south would be about 25 miles. The county
averages about 12, 12 miles in diameter.
This shaded area here, schematically in the center
of the county, is Emporia.

The Meherrin River cuts west-to-

easfc across the county, right through the middle of Emporia
and on and over.

So, in a literal sense, it turns out that

all roads sort of lead to Emporia.
across that river are at Emporia.

And the only bridges
The bridge that the local

people usually usa is the connecting link between North Main
Street and South Main Street in Emporia.'
Another signifcant fact is, which minimises this
question of transportation and so forth, every school in the
system, the high school that, was built for the — the Negro
high school is located about hare? the elementary school,
there’s one here, and one over here.

All of them within a

radius of two and a half miles from some point in Emporia.
No school is more then two or three miles out of town.
So the distance traveled, or the difference in
distances in this problem are minimal.

8

Between XS'65, when this litigation was commenced,
and 1969, mien complete desegregation was ordered, the black
majority of pupils had decreased by 223.

Prom 2700 to 2477.

And the white minority had decreased by 518? from 1800 to 1282,
We are essentially talking about a school system of about
3750 pupiIs, roughly.
It's true that after this litigation had been two
years in going, July 31, 1S67, Emporia obtained its conversion
to a second-class city status.
Now, we don't make a big point about, the- testimony
that their purpose was to get a better break on the sales
tasc proceeds. But we do submit that whatever the underlying
motivation for the transition, the transition was made subject
to the right, the power, and the duty of the District Court
to dispose of this case, and accomplish the desegregation
of the schools of the county, including those that were
situ&ted in'Emporia»
Nov?, as the law required, the Emporia City Council
appointed members to a newly formed Emporia School Board.
That school board functioned only in two respectss

It joined

in signing the April 10, 1968, contract between Emporia arid
Greensville County, by which the county was going to continue
to provide certain essential services, welfare, the sheriff,
the courthouse, and even, and specifically,the public schools?
and the city agreed that it would pay a share, calculated on a

9
percentage basis, for those services.
The only other function performed by the-: school board,
until desegregation was ordered, was that the school board
amt -’*» X*ai not sure whether it was annually or —* once a year
jointly with the county school board so that they could
legally hire a Superintendent of Schools,

Otherwise the

schools went on, the county school board ran the schools;
business as usual.
As a matter of fact, there was no complaint, no
question at all or the part of the city school officials or
tile City Council members as to the resistance that the county
schoc1 board was putting up in this lawsuit to desegregate the
schools, and even after the Hew Kent case, t promptly filed
motion for relief in light of New Kent, the county school
board was successful, one way or another, by proposing plans
that obviously would not work, or — a series of everything?
that they successfully held off the inevitable for a full year.
Until the District Court considered that the county
board had repeatedly failed and virtually refused to propose
an adequate desegregation plan, asked the plaintiffs to
prepare a plan, which we did, and essentially that's the plan
that'3 in operation in the schools right now.
•/

- '

When the court announced that it would adopt that
plan, that announcement being made in June 1969.

But the taste

of a hard-put victory didn't last very long, because suddenly

10
wa find ourselves had to play in other ballgames.
July 23rd, when the county school board sought to have
the court make amendmentsy to the plan that the plaintiffs
had offered, it was considered administratively desirable and
it was not objected to by the plaintiffs»
The court, taking that matter under- advisement, was
advised that the •— by the county school board, that they may
have to come’ back to submit another plan if the city children
withdrew from the school system.
And that remark alerted plaintiffs' counsel to the
counter-attack that was then being developed by the city of
Emporia.
We found that on July 1 the City Counsel had sent
a letter to the County Board of Supervisors and th© County
School Board and their legal adviser, which letter is printed
in two Appendix at page 56.

The letter takes note of the

Federal Court’s decision in those surrogates.
paragraph of the complaint, and we’ll quote?

And the second
The directed

■i

plan becomes even more unpalatable when the school records
reflect those students ©£ the city who attend the combined
school system are;not contributing to the imbalance
v/hici apparently led this Court to order two class relocations,
busing, efc cetera, into Emporia.

The county was by that document requested to
transfer to the city the title to all school properties

I

11
cited within the city, and in return the county was promised
that r.pon payment of the tuitioa the county students wight
attend the city schools on a first-come-firsfc-served basis.
Wo think it obvious that they were referring to the
white students of the county.
Because if they had been anticipating the black
students of the county also attending the schools, there would
have been no real purpose for their separating the schools.
This is just one of the many evidences in this
record justifying the District Court's finding that Emporia’s
decision to secede from the county was racially motivated.
From the beginning, the city's concern was with the
1880 black county children, two-thirds — three-fourths, X
believe, that the plaintiff declares , which, as the city
officials saw it, caused the racial imbalance which had
required the desegregation order.
On July 14, 1S69, the minutes of that find — in the
Appendix at page 62 — and we think that they are the essence
of the plaintiff's case here.
On July 14th the City Council had met publicly in ©
special session,

Those minutes leave no doubt as to the

purpose of the assembly, or as to the motivations of those
who addressed the assembly, including the Council members.
Mayor Lee announced, and let me quote:

"The purpose

of the meeting is to take action on the establishment of a City

12
School System, to try and urva a school system for the City of
Emporia and Greensville county»”
He further, later said that:

The City of Emporia

and Greensville County are as one, we could work together to
save our school system.n
When the cases came on for trial, the things that
Mayor Lee had to say about the officials of Greensville County
were a hoi© lot less complimentary, and we had the idea that
Greensville County and Emporia had bean waging a long, drawnout war»
But at the time they’re making this decision, at the.
time that they're really under the impact of the Federal Court
order, the city and county are as one and we can cooperate and
til. save our school system and carry on business as we always
have.
Mr. Lankford, to show the racial interest in their
decision, or the racial effect in that decision, chairman of
the City School Board, gave a plan judged on Judge Merhige's
ruling, and percentages of Negroes in each school for the first
seven grades if Judge Merhige's order would be allowed to go
into effect.
You cannot read the minutes of that meeting
without seeing that the thing about which the city was unhappy
was the fact that the District Court order was going to require
actual desegregation of the public schools in Greensville County

13
Iit the Coot of jc.-ii.js S5 fro® the same minutes, we
see that' Mr, Lankford, chairman of the School Board, told the
Council that approximately 500 county children could attend
city schools if the city obtained the buildings it wanted.
There were only 728 white children, white county children in
the system.
How, a separate system offered the only way to
continue to insulate these children from that mass, or what
they considered a mass, of 1838 black children who lived in
the county.
Mnd that was what was to be accomplished at all costs,
even ~~ and we get from the minutes — even if it required
moving into temporary buildings and using makeshift equipment „
as a matter of the separation.
How, at the interlocutory hearing, hearing on the
interlocutory injaction, some three weeks later, the Mayor,
in response to the City Attorney’s leading question, testified
that the primary motive in separating was to provide a sub”
stantially superior education.
And a month later, at the December plenary hearing,
the City School Board exhibited an elaboratley expensive
budget, which the school board saw for the first time, and
adopted at a meeting held IS days prior to the trial, and which
the City Council saw for the first time and adopted two nights
later.

14
But, in July, when the decision to secede was made,
linark quality was a more palatable percentage of black
children»

ted the fiscal thinking reflected in the July

meeting was the'expression of the Mayor that a city system
wouldn't cost any more than they were paying being with the
county, and that they could take county students in on a
tuition basis.
Nothing else in that meeting on questions of the
dollars and cents was expressed.

That was the thinking in July

when the City School Board was instructed to take immediate
steps to establish a school division for the City of Emporia,
ted the City Attorney was instructed to take immediate steps
to effect the legal separate in terms of the equity which the
city and county had in the jointly owned property.
July 31st, the City School Board published a notice
to parents, that they should — the city parents, that they
should register in the city schools, and that notice invited
the county parents to register their children on a first-comeno transportation»tuition basis.

The City Attorney wasn't quite so prompt in
executing his directive, because it wasn't until October of
1969 that ho filed a suit to have the State Court invalidate
the contract, if'the contract was indeed invalid.
For.some reason, the Court of Appeals was of the
impression that fcha sequence of events happened that, first.

15
:1b June of 1969 the City Attorney advised the Council that
the contract was void.

And the city then filed action in the

State Court to have the contract invalidated.

And that the

parents were then notified that the city children would attend
city schools? and then the plaintiffs filed a supplemental
complaint seeking an injunction.
But, things didn't happen in that sequence„
notification to the parents was dated July 31st.
supplemental complaint was filed- August 1st.

The

The

The hearing on

the notion for an interlocutory injunction was August 8,? and
sometime after that hearing the Council doubtless was advised
that the contract might be successfully attacked. And the
court met on October 1st, the suit for that purpose was filed
in the State Court.
How, the erroneous impression of tl$s Court of
Appeals seems to have stemmed from the testimony of Mr.
Lankford, chairman of the City School Board, whan he was asked
by the City Attorney: When did you obtainva lawyer who advised
you that the contract was illegal and violated the
Constitution?

And his answer was:

in .Jun£>.

But on cro£3~exaraination, we developed that the
advice was a matter

something to him as an individual, he

was not a member of the Council, he was chairman of the School
Board, it was not given at a meeting of -.the School Board or the
City Council or any ether group.

16

iilid whoa x-r.i road -cl-a testimony that was being heard
at the August interlocutory hearing, we find that the school
hoard people and the City Council people looked upon this
contract as a formidable obstacle.

As a matter of fact, going

back to the minutes of that July meeting, at which the City
Attorney was present,

they spoke of the contract as being

something they might be able to void by mutual consent or by
annexing the territory from the county».

armsration

The

contract had a provision that it would terminated if the city
didn’t take it in annexation.

He said that there was racial

He gave them credit for their protestations that

they wanted to develop a better school system, but he could not
close his ©yes to the fact that the thing that triggered the

17
entire thing was his order.
1" think that's a fair statement of it., Mr, Justice
Rehnquist.
But another and perhaps more important aspect of
Fourth Circuit majority misstating the facts of the case,
the Circuit Court sought, to ascertain the primary purpose of
the city, by looking to the projections of the numbers and
percentages of the black and; white' students which were going tobe attending the two systems.
The city5s witness had predicted a 48 percent black and
a 52 percent white ratio in the city-operated high school.
And a similar but inverted ratio in the city-operated elementary
school.

But thesa predictions blink the facts.
‘the anticipated return of ten percent of the school

population from the private schools weald increase the white
percentage to the high school to 56 percent»
There is some talk in the testimony about annexation,
and they could annex outlying areas of the county and increase
[s£«? eity3
white population of the county immeasurably, while the
figure given

in measuring the population are not accurate.

Then, to face the realities of life, they didn't take into
account that the children who lived in the county could manage
to live with relatives in the city or with friends or with
people who could afford to move from the county into the city
or i\,t© the new part: of the city to be annexed, in order that

18
the i:-;; oc ilelren could attend the public school.
Q

Mr, Tucker, —

MR. TUCKERS
q

Yes, sir,

— are you. — I'm not sure whether you're now

taking issue with the allocation of students entirely within
Emporia, or whether you’re talking about the impact on the
whole; school district, as it was before Emporia was catved out,
MR. TUCKER: Well, 1 think it's a little difficult to
keep the two separate, because one won’t be ae on the other,
anyhow.
Q.

Yes.

But your last remarks and the figures you

were giving, that is, do you challenge the end result within
Emporia as an improper allocation, just as to Emporia, laying
aside the impact on the district or county as a whole?
MR. TUCKER: Well, I find it difficult to really think
that the figures in the vicinities could make a whole lot of
difference, but when we look at the entire picture, whatever
happens in Emporia to increase the white majority is going to
increase the black majority in the county.

And it doesn’t take

a whole lot of imagination to see that the county schools
would become, for all intents and purposes, or remain, for
ail intents and purposes, black schools.
But with a few shifts, annexation, or adjustments or
r. t ^ i

j basisO I» or county children attending the city schools

on a tuition basis, that the white children would remain out of

19
the schools cited in the county, just as they have remained
out of those schools during the freedom of choice, and ever
since Brown.
Q

Well, are you suggesting a reverse flight, that

is a county flight into the city —
MR. TUCKER:
Q

I am suggesting that»

— of white pupils?

MR. TUCKER: That's what would happen, and 1 think
that s fairly what the Council meant when it was trying to
negotiate with the city, with the county, to get the buildings
and promising that the county children may corae in on a tuition
basis and so forth.
Q

WeIlf give. me again, so I have it clear in my

mind, what is the composition of the Emporia schools?

Just

within Emporia, what is the breakdown?
MR* TUCKER:
Q

At present, or what Emporia proposed? /

At present, and what they proposed.

ME,. TUCKER;: Well, at present, the plan that the
plaiitiffs proposafl and the District Court approved is in opera­
tion, and it has been in operation two and a half years.

So

that the grades 1, 2, and 3 are children from all the area
attending the Emporia Elementary School.

And grades 10, 11,

and 12 of children all over the area, both county and city,
that presently attend the high school? and have been doing this
over two and a half years.

20
It happens-that ws got the in junction in time,, and
the District Court gave the injunction to protect his order,
and the order went into effect, and'-What are those figures at present?

Q

In Emporia,

within the city of Emporias,
ME. TUCKERs

I said that the figures at present —

well, the best figures that we have is that the city had
543 white children and 5SO Negro children.

The county had

728 white children and 1888 Negro children.
Q

What * s the figure again, 700?

MR. TUCKERS
Q

728 white; .1889 black.

But, Mr. Tucker, as the situation is now, the

two .schools in the city of Emporia are serving first grades
.1, 2, and 3 for the whole county; is that right?
MR. TUCKERs
Q

Yes.

And what’s the percentage of Negro and what’s

the percentage of white people in that primary school, do you
know?
MR, TUCKERs

I\s the record — or updated figures,

which do you ■—
Q

Well, whatever.

MR. TUCKERs

It may not be exact, of course.

Well, the record would show, on page

29? of the Appendix, in the Emporia Elementary School it's
30.1 percent white and 69.9 percent Negro.
high school, that's in the city, —

And the senior

21
Q

That would be about the same, wouldn't 'it?

MR. TUCKER*

44„9 percent white and 55.1 percent

Negro.
Q

Because of some —• a good many children don't

go through high school, is that it?
MR. TUCKER;

Yes.

Quite a bit of it.

We'd like to suggest that the method that the Circuit
used to divide purpose from objection was — not a valid
nothing — that the only, the bast way we know what people’s
purposes ara is what they say their purpose is at the time
they're making the decision.

And the time they’re making the

decision, why, when we read this, read the minutes of that
time or read what they were doing and saying at that time,
the purpose is all too clear? and that was to get out from
under the District Court forum.
We also would like to suggest that the Circuit
form a rule of ascertaining the dominant purpose, but we
think it erred in that it applied that rule rather than to remand
to the District Court, for him to have make this,
in the light of that rule.
We think that in any aspect of this case, that the
judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed, for any
one of sisc reasons.
One, if any validity could possibly attach to the
Fourth Circuit * s requirement of a balancing, a benign purpose

22
against the constitutional imperative, then this being a new
rule, as we said, the ease should have been remanded to the
District Court, no made the initial judgment and the balancing.
We suggest that the proposed balancing test is
invalid*

That the Constitution commands that the school

systems ba desegregated, and it makes no exception to permit
that command to be subordinated to notions of quality
education or anything else, however so benign.
And what we have here was to point tc the beautiful
school system they have for Emporia,

They omit the fact that

the three-fourths of the plaintiff class is going to be
automatically cut out of that beautiful system? and I don't
think that the Constitution allows us to balance the rights
of those children against the proposed benign purposes.
We think that, as I said, that we think the Fourth
Circuit erred in trying to ascertain, or ignoring the motiva­
tions and purposes as expressed, would, as the fact was going
on, rather than trying to ascertain them from some projections*
We think that the District Court was correct —

ORAL ARGUMENT OF D. DORTCH WARRINER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WARRINER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I think at the outset it might be well to remark that
the facts as found by the District Court and by the Court of
Appeals should be looked to for a determination of what are
the tinder lying facts in this case, rather than to the suspicions
expressed by counsel at bar.
And in this connection I would point to page 318
of the Joint Appendix, where the Court of Appeals said;
"Notably, there was no finding of discriminatory
purpose, and instead the court noted its satisfaction that the
city would, if permitted, operate its own system on a unitary
basis.a
Obviously the case must be as it appears, rather than
as one might think it might have been.
We have listened here this morning to the Scotland

24
Neck case, along with the Courts, and that* if we may express
an opinion* it is a strong case.
We believe* because of certain differences of
substance * that the case which Emporia has before you is an
even stronger case.
In the Emporia ease there are no new laws involved*
there is- no Chapter 31 to see.

The city of Emporia is not

in existence because the State interposed anything* as they
did in Scotland Neck.
Emporia is in existence not because of any special
Act of the General Assembly of Virginia, but is in existence*
instead, because it has followed the unique pattern of
independent cities which has existed in our Commonwealth for
at least a hundred years.
When the town of Emporia, in the summer of 1967,
became a city, automatically it became a school district.
No additional Act of legislation, no additional group of
people having to get together, or to sign anything.

Auto­

matically, under Section 133 of the Constitution of Virginia,
the city of Emporia became a separate school district.
It became a separate governmental entity for all
purposes, other than those related to the Circuit Court, in
the Circuit of which it's a part.

That is, the sheriff,

Commonwealth's attorney, and the clerk of the court.
Q

When you say if automatically became a school

25
district, could they have had any option about it?
MR, WARRXNBRs

There are some provisions in the

State Statutes of Virginia, and under Section 133 of the
Constitution of Virginia, which, with the consent of two
governing bodies# two independent governing bodies, such as
two cities or a city and an adjoining county, there may be
a joint school board in which both the city and the county, as
the case might be, would have representation.
They could then operate a joint school district.
Absent consent from both governing bodies# there is
no prevision under Virginia law for a joint school district.
And in this case, as the evidence shows, the County of
Greensville# which would be the logical adjoining county,
refused flatly to consent to any joint school system.
Q

Rut they

1 take it that under Virginia law

a Lschcol district like Emporia became could contract with the
adjoining oountv without joining with them in a joint school
board?

Contract for educational services to city children.
MR. W&RRINERs

No# sir.

The contract provision.

•is contained in Section 20**99 of the Code, if I've cited it,
correctly, and the contract provision specifically provides
that even in the event of a contract# that the city must have
representation on a joint school board.

There would foe

representation for each magisterial district of the county,
and representation of the city.

26
Q

So you think Emporia, since 1965 , had been

acting in conflict with that statute?
MR. WARRIKERs 1967 was when Emporia became a city,
Q

All right, then, 567.

MR. WARRINBR:

Yes.

At that time the city of

Emporia elected its school board, as required by law, and as
the facts show considered very seriously and in depth the
determination of forming its own school system.
Q

Yes.

MR. WARRXNER:

Because of problems that existed at

that time, largely having to do with the availability of
school buildings.
The city than mdved to 'the next choice, and that is
the joint school board.

This the county refused.

And so the

city, in April of 1968, after having become a city in August
of 1567, was presented with an ultimatum from the county,
sayings

If you don*1 sign this particular contract, which

the county had drawn, without change, and do it by the 30th
of April, your children will be expelled from our schools.
And under these circumstances a contract was entered
into which, in the opinion of counsel, was a void and illegal
contract under the Constitution of Virginia.
Q

Bow, has that

that contract has been the

subject of litigation in the Virginia Courts?
MR. BARRZNERs

It is presently before the Supreme

27
Court of Appeals of Virginia,
Q

And no decision?

MR. WARRINER:

Wo decision.

It has not been argued.

The briefs have been filed.
Q

What was the

MR. WARSINERS The

decision in the lower court?
lower court said that contracts of

this -- I'll try to quote ~ contracts of this type are
unconstitutional? but since

a necessity existed at the time

that thecontract was entered into, the

court will not hold it

unconstitutional.
This was the opinion of the lower courts, which left
us in quite a quandary, as you. can imagine.

Q

Yes..

Q

Mr. Warriner, am I wrong in thinking that the

town of Emporia# when it reached the population level, did
have an option as whether to elect to become a city or not?
MR. WARRINERs That is correct.

Once a town has

passed the 5,000 point in population, it may elect to become
a city by merely filing a census with the court, and the
court enters an order saying it is now a city.
And this became an imperative thing for the towns of
over 5,000 in Virginia to do in 1967, because of the enactment
in that year of a State sales tax, which returned to the point
of sale, that is the source, one cent out of every dollar
spent.

And so long as the town of Emporia, which was the

28

market area, was a town, then the money was being returned to
the county, which was not a market area.
Ass soon as it became a city, then the one cent was
returned to the city;: and that was why the haste to proceed
immediately to become a city before the law came into effect.
Q

Well, was there any allegation in this case, or

any findings by the District Court that the decision to become
a city had anything to do with the school situation?
MS. WARRINERs
Q

Mo allegation, no claim, and ho finding.

Yes.

MR. WARRINER: And this is, again, a somewhat different
case, I think, from Scotland Meek, in which there were some
allegations to that effect.
Also, Scotland Neck is stili a part of Halifax
County.

The city drEmporia is not a part of the County of

Greensville.

It is not a part of it for any purpose, not

the purpose of,the basic school levy or the purpose of the
superimposed school levy, or any other purpose, other than,
as I mentioned, in connection with the Circuit Court.
Another —
Q

The Circuit Court covers, or can cover- in

Virginia more than one county, though, can't it?
MR. WARRXNERt
covers six counties.

Q

Right.

It does in our particular case, it

ME. WARRINER: And tvro cities.
Q

Yes.

ME. WAREINERs . toother, X think, difference which may
weigh in the balance is the fact that in the city of Emporia„
with its separate,, distinct school system, there will be no
schools with a white majority,* all the schools will .be with a
black majority.

Actually I think, for purposes of argument,

we generally think of if as being 50/50, but at the time of
1969 the ratio would have been 52 percent black, 48 percent
white* And I think the Chief Justice asked what the present
figures were*

And they would be, if you care to have them,

55 percent black and 43 percent white, if the school were in
existence at the present time.
Q

Well row, X don't *— I’m not sure X get that.

MR* WARRINER: The city school system would be 55 per""
t

cent black and 45 percent white as of this school year.
Q

If what you wanted to prevail should prevail?

MR. WARRINER: That's correct, yes, sir.
4

Q

Or would have prevailed.

black, 45 percent white.

It'd foe 55 percent

All through or —

MR. WARRIKER: All through the city school system,
Becav.se, you see, we would have the simplest type of unitary
systems

it would have one elementary school building into which
y ‘childrs

aid got it would have one high schoc

building into which all high school children would go.

It

30
would have, far all practical purposes, the most perfect
integration of schools that one could seek anywhere.
Q

So, except insofar as it might be affected by

dropouts in the higher grades, in the high school, that
percentage would pretty well carry through from grade 1 through
grads 12?
ME. WAERlNERi That is correct, and we also envision,
and it is in evidence, a special program and hope to prevent
dropouts.

An enhancement program aimed specifically at

potential dropouts.
0

When did the Distr Court plan go into effect?

ME. WARRINERs The District Court plan was to go into
effect in the fall of 1969.

It was decided in June of 1969,

effective that fall.
Q

You said it "was to'5, did it or did it not go
)

into effect?
MR. WARRINERs Did it go into effect?
Q

Yes.

Oh, yes, sir.

That’s why your phrase "was to go into

effect" misled ms for a moment.
MR. WAREXNER:
Q

I9m sorry.

It went into effect and the Court of Appeals

did not stay the order?
MR. WARRINER: That’s correct.
And the schools at the present time just simply are
not racially identifiable.

For the past three years the

31
iority of blacks in all ©f the schools of the comity has b .
roughly 2 or 3 to 1.
And this would be in schools that might be character­
ised as formerly all-white.

They are all now with a black

majority# and they will be with a black majority after the city
is permitted to proceed with its unitary school plan.
Q

Now, you said that if the school board, the

Emporia city plan had gone into effect# it would have been
55/45?
MR. WARRINERt As of this school year.
Q

How# what is it in fact now# let me get that

difference clearly in mind.
MR. WARRINER:

In fact not* the ratio is 66 percent

black# 34 percent white.
Q

That*3 because of the — going outside of the
/

city into fits county?
MR. WARRINERs

That’s — yes# that’s because the.

entire system of Greensville County# with the city of Emporia
combined# would give you a ratio of 66 blacks to 34 whites.
If the city were proceeding in its own system# it
would be — the city would he 55 percent black# 45 percent
white ? and the remaining county would be a change from 66
percent combined to 71 percent# if it were by itself.
And the city — the county would have 29 percent
white? if it wore by itself.

Q•
to be built?

Mr, Warriner, when are these buildings going
You say there5 s going to be one high school and

one elementary school, Are they in existence now?
MR, WARRINERs
Q

They are in existence.

MR. WARRINER;
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Tour Honor.

And are there any other schools?

MR, WARRINER% Within the city?
Q

Yes, sir.

MR. WARTIMESs There is a school known as the
Greensville County Training School, which is located on the
edge of the city, the northeastern edge of the city.
Q

What are you going to do with that?

MR. WARRINER:

We do not desire — if the county

needs it and would use it.

In our suit, what we call the

equity suit, which is our suit to allocate to the city that
which it is entitled to have upon transition from a town to a
city, we have asked for that which we needed, and no more.
And we need, or to meet the needs of the schoolchildren of
the city, an elementary school building and a high school
building.
Q

How many county children are going to be in the

city schools?
MR. WARRINER:
Q

Nona?

Rone.

33

MR. >JAi*aiNSRx
Q

IfcM,

No, air.

And no possibility of transfer?

MR» WARRINER: • Mo» sir, not unless the restrict ■
Court says so.

Q

And no city children in the county schools?

MR. NARaxHBK?
Q
Q

Hons.

None, sir.

Right.
Under o Virginia law, if a city and the

surrounding county have this joint arrangement, this joint
school board as the law permits, how does the city, under the
law, then pay for its education?
MR. WARRINER:
Q

It presents a problem because ~~

They don’t become subject to county taxation?

MR. WARRINER:

No.

No, each body, each governmental

body has to raise its proportionate share, which is•generally
a contractual share of the combined budget.

And the problem

exists bacasue one body or the other may want to spend more or
leas than the other.
Q

Who —

MR. WARRINER:
Q

And we don't have

excuse me.

Under the law, the representation that the city

would have to have on the board, is it specified?
MR. WARRINERs

Yet, Your Honor.

One for each ward.

There; happened to be four wards in the city of Emporia, but
them's ho reason why we couldn't have more wards than that, cr

less wards than that, which again leads to awkwardness in the
Q

So you wouldn’t know who would have voting

control of the joint hoard?
MR. WARRINER:

1 would suspect, in all fairness,

that the county should have voting control of the joint board#
because its population is roughly 2 to 1 that of the city.
Q

Did the county give a reason for rejecting the

proposal?
MR. WARRXMBRj
Q

No# Your Honor# they did not»

Well, anyway# it’s not in the record?

ME» WARRINERs

It’s not in the record# and so far

as I know they didn’t give a reason? they just said they
weren't going to do it.

Which Is not contrary to the usual

course of affairs between the city of Emporia and the County of
Greensville? it*s part of the pattern.

And it's part of fch©

reason we’re here.
As a matter of fact# it’s the overwhelming reason
that we’re here.
This case is not the usual soning case# with which
you have dealt before# as you can readily sea.

A zoning

case involvas -on© government# which is dividing itself up into
attendance sonas.

That’s not the case here. We’re talking

about two governments.
The populace of one having no voice whatever in the
operations of the other.

And since the stay of the District

35
Courts,

order, as e matter of fact since 1967, the children

of the city of Emporia have been educated in a school system
over which their parents, the taxpayers, and their City
Council, and. their City School Board has had not one item or
iota of control.

This of course is contrary to the old

American idea of how government ought to be run,

opinion

on

Did the District Court purport to issue any
the legality of the contract arrangement?

MR. WARBINER:

No, it did not, Your Honor,

And that

is a State Court matter, it’s under the State law that it’s
illegal.
However, I think that certainly there’s a Federal
question involved.
Q

Under the District Court's order, what is the

arrangement between city and county?
MR, WARRXNER:
just stated it.

Was it specified?

No, Your Honor, it's exactly as I've

Our children go to a school system over which

we have no control.
Q

Well, 1 know, but how about money?

MR. WARRINER: We have to pay — the- order said that we
should pay our, quote, "proportionate or proper share".

And

we are now paying a share which we unilaterally determine to
be appropriate and proper, hud -that is, we took the local
effort and divided it by the total number of children in the
school system, and we're paying on a per-capit© basis.

36
•This involves problems of capital expenditures,
which are difficult to root out, and certainly we don’t owe
anything to capital expenditures j but this is the most
anomalous situation that we're; in under the present situation,
and it is ample justification of what we ©re seeking to do.
No governing body, no people would want the most
important aspect of local government to he completely out of
their control, as it is in the city of Emporia.
Q

How, this plan has been in. operation how long?

MR. WARRINER;

Since June the 25th, 1969, when it

was entered by the District Court.
Q

Now, has the county been appropriating funds to

implement the plan?
MR. WARRINERs
Q

Well, the county.

MR. WARRXNER:
Q

The city appropriated funds?

Oh, yes.

I mean for transportation.

This District

Court plan involved some busing, did it?
MR. WARRINER: Well, it involved busing of city
children out into the county to county schools, and the city
has had to pay its proportionate share of that.
Q

And I read in the City Council's minutes that

they were fearful the county wouldn't seriously implement the
plan.
MR. WARRINERs That, is correct.

Q

But they are .

MR. w&RRIKERs

If Your Honor pleases, the difference

between carrying out the mechanics of the plan and carrying o«
the spirit of the plan) and it was our position then and it is
our position now that the spirit and the will which must, go
into a unitary system of education, to work, is lacking»

And

it is not lacking in the city,
The city may have delayed long in trying to pick up
the boat of the drum, but they've picked it up, and they want
to march.
And I respectfully submit that we should be seeking
end obtaining the help of our adversaries hare at the bar*
rather than their obstruction.

Because. v@ have sought * arid

0®sk now„ to implement a realistic, workable, unitary system.
We know that it can work.

And it will work, given the chance

to do it.
Q

Mr. ffarriner, did you tell me that no county

students wore going to be ir. this system?
MR. WARRINER:
Q

That’s correct, Your Honor.

Well, one of the dissenting opinions says that

you have a transfer plan.
ME. N&RRZMRt

Is that an error?
If Your Honor please — that is in

error? we do not have a transfer plan.
May I explain that a bit?
At the time that we first proposed operating our

38
independent school System, as a part of our hops of persuading
the county to do that which it ought to do., and that is turn
over to us the school buildings which rightfully should be
ours, we included, on a first-come-first-served, nc transporta­
tion basis, or tuition, the opportunity for anyone who wanted
to attend the city school system to attend it.
Tha district Court expressed doubt about the validity
of til at.

W® said s

very well, if there is any question about

it, if that shows any, casts any doubt upon our good faith,
we freely and willingly give it up.

Arid we have.

I think that we have to view this case conceptually,
by going back to the basis.

What constitutional right has

been violated?
Now, no constitutional right, admittedly, was
violated at the time the town of Emporia became a city in
196'?,

And so if a right has been violated, it had to be

violated us &. result of having a separate school system flowing
from the city status.
And you've looked at the school system, and you see
that there is a completely and wholly unitary system in the
city of Emporia.

You look, if you will, at the county school

system, and you see a complete and wholly unitary school system
in the county.

Nothing artificial in either case.

Nothing forced.

Nothing temporarily expedient, in

order to obtain seme particular balance.

39
But the natural consequences of non~State action
result in two separate school units, each having within it a
ur.it

system, each with no predominance of one race over the

other, but each representing the commodity which it intended to

servfs.
Now, if there is a constitutional right involved,
it must be a constitutional right to a specified ratio, because
we're not damaging any other right.

There might be a right to

a specified ratio in some geographic area.
We submit that Swann didn't say that,
say that.

green didn’t

And Sponger v. Ku.gler, decided by this Court in

January, did not say that.
Where there is no showing of State action, which
produced a.racial pattern in a community, and certainly in
southsicta Virginia there is no racial pattern.

There is a ~~

it is a completely intermixed community, no one in Emporia
lives over three blocks from someone of a different race.
2t's just that way.
So not only is no State action creating a racial
pattern, it doesn't exist.
Just as in Kugler;

just as in Kuglesr, the boundary

lines of the city of Emporia were not drawn in an attempt
to gerrymander in or out anyone.

And when I mention that,

I'm .reminded of the fact that in closing, counsel for the
plaintiffs mentioned something about 15 percent of the children

40
being included out.

Twenty-five percent of his clients are

included in a substantially better system, which is the
uncontradicted evidence in this case, and certainly they are
entitled to rights.

Where a unitary school system can bring

about a better school system, then it ought to be implemented.
Too often# X feel sure you hear the arguments before
you that the unitary school system is going to bring about a
poorer school system.
argument,

This is just the opposite of that

tod it is a sincere argument.

And it is an argument

which is not contradicted in the evidence? as a matter of
fact, the evidence is conclusive to that effect, as found by
the District Court.
Q

Let’s assume that as part of the District Court8

plan the court had ordered

I*m not suggesting that it had

the power to? I'm not suggesting that it didn't ~ but suppose
it had ordered that the county make available to the city a
proportionate share based on students# a proportionate share
of representation on the County School Board.

And that the

money that the city was going to contribute, let’s assume# was
fair» in terms of anybody's judgment.
Would .you still foe here?
MR. WARRXNER:

Yes# Your Honor.

I think that the

record which we have presented to you is abundantly clear that
the problem of having a separate — the desire to have a
separate school system for the city of Emporia# just as every

41
other city in Virginia has, has bean one of long standing.

What's the composition of the County School

MR. WARRXWERs
Q

Yes,

Insofar as race is concerned?

Number and race.

MR. WARBIHSRs

There are four people on the County

School Board# three of whom are white and one of them is black.
Q

And what's the population of the county?

HR, WARRINERs

Population of the county is about

9,000.
Q

Divided between blacks and whites?

MR* WARRXHBRs Roughly 50/30,
I think that I5m correct in saying there are four,
In any event, it’s four or five, and one of them is black.

I

think it’s four,
If there is anything in the decision of Swann, with
respect to the problem of flexibility# the problem being
mat by flexibility, that the school boards have plenary power

43
provided there is no invidious discrimination, than this is
the case to apply the language of Swann.

This is a case

where a city has undertaken its obligation under - Brown, and
has asked and fought for the right, through the courts, to
provides a realistic unitary school system.
Q

Well, you say, then, that the desire to maintain

a racial balance in the school, acceptable to the white
population, is not a factor in this case, as it is said to be

Well, what did the Court of Appeals say about

MR. W&RRINER; They didn’t make any observation on
that, that I can recall.
Q

And how about the District Court?

MR. WARBX2SER:

Nor did the District Court.

There was discussion of the fact that a good school
system would help make a viable, growing community, which would
include both white and black; but,” so far as 1' can recall,
neither the Distri.ct Court nor the Court of Appeals addressed
itself to white flight, and, as far as 'X can recall, neither

Q

Mr. Tucker, let roe ask you one question.

Suppose in 1965, is that when this litigation, your case
started?
MR. TUCKER: That's right.
Q

Suppose in 1565 that Emporia had reached this

5,001 population point —*
MR. TUCKER:
Q

I think it had.

Oh,, it. had?

Well, that makes it easier.

-- and Emporia said, We're tired of waiting for
these people out in the county to catch up with what the
Court says is required in compliance with the Constitution,
and we want to run a purely unitary system, and they withdrew

prevail, that have just been described to us, and they had

since.

have the-power to says

Do you think the District Court waul

Yes, that's fine that you were ahead

of these people all this time, but now you've got to be put
into the whole county system?
MR, TUCKER* Well, if Your Honor please, 1 live there,
end if Emporia had, in 1965, decided — made any such decision,
you could have knocked ms over with a feather!
Q

Well, but suppose they had?

MR, TUCKER* Suppose they had?
Q

That's the central question.

Would the

District Court now have the power to do what it did?
MR. TUCKER:

I think it probably would have had the

power, if anything like I believe would happen in Emporia, if
— hfid Emporia — well, had Emporia, you're saying, created
a unitary non-racial school system as early as .1965, would
the District Court have had power to eliminate the minds and
expand the school system to — I think it could have, if the
necessity would have required it.
If, as a result of that, or even without a result,
if it meant that the children in the county were attending
what in effect were racially segregated schools, if it meant
that the children in the county were attending racially
identifiable schools, were being denied equal protection of
the law, I think the District Court could take, could use the
command of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Statos, not to a

46
squal educational opportunities for all the children in the State, as far as that was
practical■
So 1 wouldn’t have any whole lot of problem if the
evidence demonstrated the necessity for that, for the District
Court to have erase

the lines and required one school system»

.Because, after all, cur doctrine of federalism does not
recognise the State’s carve-outs? it makes a demand to the
State not to deny any person within the,jurisdiction of the
State equal protection of the laws.
tod that; is the basis for this entire line of
litigation now.

the riddle of the page,"the Court finds that, in a sense, race
w®3

t, factor in the city’s decision to secede.”
Q

But the Court of Appeals said the - record does

not suggest that Emporia chose to become a city in order to

47

prevent or diminish integration?
MR * TUCKER: .The Court of Appeals managed to avoid
the District Court’s finding that race was a factor,
Q

Bui that was it's decision to become a city.

The real question is what about its decision to —
HR. TUCKERs

Its decision to become a city 1 think

is immaterial to our consideration here,
Q

You don’t say that ♦—

HR. TUCKER*

But its decision to secede from the

school system ~~
Q

Yes.. All right.

MR. TUCKER:

— is the thing that the District Court

was addressing — found race to be a motivating factor.
And 1 don’t think that conclusion is unavoidable,
it would just look at the minutes of July 14, 1969, when they
made the decision, and look at the things that they did,
even the resolution of the City School Board asking the State
Board, to decree them a separate school division.

Every

preamble points to the District Court orders, the thing with
which they were unhappy.
Being unhappy about the quality of the school system
came after the application for an injunction, as a matter of
preparation for trial.
The question was asked whether we have private
schools, :

irriner correctly answered that we don't have

48
a privata school in the County of Greensville? but in the
neighboring comity of Brunswick there is a private school, ant
a considerable number of white children do attend the private
school there•

As a matter of fact# I think that’s in the record,

in the testimony of the Mayor somewhere# where he refers to
the people who have gone to the private school in the neighboring:
county of Brunswick.

You get all the way across# which would

be about SO miles away from Emporia.
Q

Mr. Tucker# your reference to the District

Court’s finding on page 307a, you left

a couple of words out#

and 1 wanted to ask you what they meant.
“The Court finds that# in a sense# race was a factor
in the city’s decision to’secede.”
What do you think the judge meant when he said "in a
sense ’!?

MR. TUCKERs

Well# my -— it's rather difficult for

roa tc say what Judge Merhige meant.

1 can say that the

evidence he4s looking at# and I think the evidence he was
looking at was the fact that the people took into consideration#
when they made their decision to secede; they took into
consideration# as shown by their minutes, the percentages of
blacks that would be in the schools under Judge Merhige’s
decision.
The Chairman of the School Board came to the Council
meeting armed with that information# the testimony is that, he

49
nent by the Superintendent?s office to get it, so he could
carry that information to the Council, to the Council meeting,
at which the formal decision to .secede was made.
Q

Well, Mr. Lankford» as chairman-''of the School
\

*

'

Board» testified —
MR. TUCKBRs That’s correct.
Q

that part Of the desire was to have a quality

school system that would hold the residents, the white
residents in the public schools rather than deciding to- go to
private schools.
MR. TUCKERs

1 recall that in his testimony, sir.

But again 1 go back to the letter of July 14, and
1 find two references to quality education, arid I get that the
hallmark of quality there was the palatable racial mix in tha
schools,

X mean, that's the impression X get from reading

tha minutes of July 14» where they made the decision.

That

.

that 3 what they were concerned about.
They weren't concerned with spending money then,
fcecai-so their only question of money was the Mayor's
suggestion that:

VTn can operate city schools as cheaply, or

for as ranch money as we can in the county? and we can take
county students in on a tuition basis.
linei X can’t omit the fact, even though now the city
can protest that no county children will come into the city,
when they decided to socede, their purpose was to let children

so
conis in on the county basis, and that cannot ba denied.

X

mentioned in my original argument that the town

could have had a separate school system, even when it was a
town,

The statute for that is printed in our brief,
I would lilce also to call the attention to — on

page Appendix 4 of the petitioners brief, Section 22-99,
which governs whan city contracts with county to furnish
facilities, that there is statutory provision provided, and
the statute provides for city representation on the school
board.
And while we5re right at that, I might even point
out that the present school board does have one black member,
who is — to my recollection, that is correct, — he was
appointed there some time after the Court's decision to
desegregate schools.

1 will point out also that the evidence

shows that two of the members of the school board live in the
city of Emporia.
Bo there is not that sort of open warfare between
Emporia and its neighbors in Greensville County? there's
been quite a bit of cooperation, even, to the point of the county
not taking any position before the District Court in our
injunctive proceedings to protect the District Court's order.
Yes, Mr. Chief Justice?
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Tucker.
MR, TUCKER:

Thank you
