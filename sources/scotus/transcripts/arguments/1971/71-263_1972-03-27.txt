P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll hear arguments

next in United States against Egan and. Walsh, 71-263.
Mr. Friedman, you may proceed,.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. FRIEDMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF O? THE PETITIONER
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case here on a. writ of certiorari to the
Third Circuit presents basically the same issue as was
before the Court in the last case.

It arises, however, in

}

a different factual context in two respects.
Q

Before you start, you said in the other case
s

that you had treated at pages 13 and 14 of the brief in this
case the Fourth Amendment grand jury cases, but you don't
f

cite even Hale v, Henkel.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

;

-

I think we do.

You don't cite Davis v. Mississippi.

MR. FRIEDMAN %

No, we don't cite Davis v.

Mississippi.
Q

1 would say without citing those two cases in

this Court you could hardly fairly say that you have treated
the problem.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Well, we dealt with it, Mr. Justice,

as thoroughly as we thought was necessary to set forth the

law in this area.
Q

You state on pages 13 and 14 the contrary

lower court decisions which# of coarse, are relevant.

But

you don't cite the lower court decisions that go against the
government nor :he decisions in this Court,

I just wondered

if you’d want to submit a short statement on what you think
the law of this Court is as of March 27, 1972.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I would be happy to# Mr, Justice.

We think the law of this Court as of today is the witnesses
do not have this right.

We cited the cases# for example,

Costello and Blue which recognise the broad role of the
grand jury and the fact that evidence improperly obtained be­
fore the grand jxiry is not—
Q

That case in 250 U. S., as I read it, the

Fourth Amendment wasn’t even involved.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

No, the Blair case, which

unfortunately we have misdescribed as the Civil Liberties
Union point, that it did not involve the Fourth Amendment
but it did announce the principle that a witness before a
grand jury could not even challenge the constitutionality—
Q

I'd just be interested in what the Department's

view on the Fourth Amendment in grand jury cases—
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I would be happy to submit such a

memorandum, Mr. Justice.
The two distinctions factually between this case

and the preceding case are these.

I

In the preceding case

there was concededly court authorized surveillance, and the
government acknowledged that the petitioners there had been
overheard on that surveillance.

In this case, the government

has never admitted any surveillance and, indeed, in its
brief in this Court .it denies that surveillance took place,
Q

So, now you finally have

taken

a

position one way or another.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

We have taken a position.

There

is no—
Q

Section 3504 rather requires that you do it

before you foist some decision-making task on a court, I
suppose.
MR. FRIEDMANs

Only, Mr. Justice, 3504 requires

that only if 3504 applies in the case of a witness before
a grand jury.
Q

Bit don't you think it makes quite a bit of

difference whether admit that there was a tap or deny that
there was a tap or you deny it was illegal or admit it was
illegal in terms of what our problems are?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

I think it does, except, Mr. Justice-

You now say no interception took place at all?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

We eay that there is no—if I may

say, there was no overhearing of either of these witnesses.
We do not take any position on whether somebody's telephone--

6
Q

What kind of a case have we got here?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

The Court of Appeals decided this

case on the assumption that in fact there was overhearing
because the government had not denied it.
Q

1 . must say, let’s assume in the District Court

the government had come in and certified, however you
normally do it, that there had been no overhearing of these
witnesses.

That would have been the end of the matter,

wouldn't it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Hopefully.

But in some situations,

Judge, the District Courts in some of these cases have said,
for example, that the affidavit that we submitted denying
the overhearing wasn't sufficient, and there have been
situations in which despite that there have been protracted
proceedings„
Q

Why should we have to deal with difficult

constitutional or statutory questions just because the
government is unwilling to say whether there was an
overhearing or not or whether it was illegal in their view?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

All I can say, Mr. Justice, is that

we did not take any position on this before the lower courts
because it was argued that the witnesses were not entitled
to this—
Q

This is just an assumed sort of a case.

Let's

assume that it's illegal so that we can get some decisions

7
on something.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It's not quite that.

Let me say

that—
Q

fhy didn't the government say yes or no in

the District Court?
MR. 7RIEDMAN:

Because all I can answer,

Mr. Justice, is that the government in these cases has
consistently taken the position in this type of situation
that a witness has no right to challenge this question, and
tins respondents-™
Q

I know.

That's fine.

But there wouldn’t

have been any question to be decided if the government had
said there wasn't any overhearing anyway.

This case would

never have been here.
MR. FRIEDMANs
in that.

If the respondents had concurred

They now object to this statement on our part, and

say they'd like us—
Q

The hearing judge would have decided one way

or another, wouIdn't he, whether there was or not?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It's also, Mr. Justice, not quite

that simple a matter for the government in these situations
every time a witness makes tills claim to be able to answer
then and there there has or hasn't been any overhearing.
Q

Wouldn't the issue have been threshed out in

the District Court if there had bean an issue made of it?

8
MR. FRIEDMANs
Q

I assume so.

P.nd the District Court would have decided it

and he may have decided it for you? and, if he had, this
case would never have been here.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

That is correct.

Mr. Friedman, suppose the question I asked

Mr. Tigar—suppose the man files an affidavit and says that
the u. So Attorney beat me over the head until I confessed.
Would the government feel obliged to deny that?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Why not deny this?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
fchis?

I would think so.

I'm sorry.

In what context is

.18 m s orr y.
Q

Motion to suppress.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
government would deny.

A motion to suppress.

I think the

That would, I assume, be an

independent motion to suppress.

When we put the ca.se, if

I may-Q
deny it;

I just don't see why the government can't

Does the government deny it now?
MR. FRIEDMANi

Yes, We do deny it.

Yes, we do.

We say there has been no overhearing of either of these
two ladies—
Q

When did you find that out?

MR. FRIEDMAN:

1 don't know when we found it out.

9

Mr» Justice»
Q

You found it out like you usually do.

In all

the post-Alder#an cases you looked around and you often
certified in this Court or in some other court there was or
there was not an interception.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I assume that when this demand was

made, this triggered an investigation and at some point in
the proceedings we concluded that there was no basis to—
Q

Mr. Friedman, in light of what you now say,

V7hy shouldn't we just vacate this and send it back and let
you start all over again in the District Court?

Why should

we grapple with these problems if the case is going to
disappear?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think one problem in this case—-in

this case—as distinguished from other cases, the claim is
now made that they deny this allegation.
Q

Then you’ll have an issue then to have

determined in the District Court,

But why should we?

Don't

we have enough things to do around here without dealing with
cases on hypotheses?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

The issue, of course, is before the

Court in the preceding case.

In this case we have this

decision of the Court of Appeals that was based on the
assumption that there had been illegal wiretapping.
Q

I take it, if we sent it back, the Court of

10
Appeals opinion v/crald be vacated too.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

If you vacated the. judgment, I think

you'd still have the precedent standing.

It would be

weakened a good bit. •
Q

If there wasn't any wiretapping: it's just

an advisory opinion anyway.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

It’s perhaps an advisory opinion

that I suspect will have considerable impact before the
Third Circuit and all tbs district courts in the Third
Circuit.
Q

Compared with one of the other cases we had

this morning/ as of right now what is the "case in
controversy" that is before us?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

The case of controversy is—

Is the opinion of a court/ not the judgment.

It's opinion./ isn’t it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think the case of controversy,

Mr. Justice, is whether or not these witnesses were properlyheld in contempt for refusing to answer the questions.
the case of controversy, and that

That's

depends on whether they

were required to answer the questions in the face of their
claim of illegal electronic surveillance.
is the case of controversy.

That seems to me

And there still is a controversy.

They still, I'm sure when counsel gets up, will vigorously
deny that they had any obligation and they will say. I'm sure,

11
that despite the government's denial they're entitled to a
hearing before they had to testify.
Q

I just can't see how both of you together can

convince us to take a case where the substance is now gone.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Well, 1 agree—

What's wrong with sending it back and let you

stand up in the Court of Appeals or the District Court and
saying no, there v?as no tap?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

I cannot find any objection to

doing that except all 1 can say, Mr. Justice, to that is
that—
Q

The opinion is still there.

MR, FRIEDMAN;

The opinion is still there and that

the Court of Appeals decided it on that basis.
Appeals decided it on that basis.

The Court o£

The Court of Appeals

announced a rule in this case.
*

Q

If you told the Court of Appeals what you're

telling us, they wouldn’t have decided that way maybe.
MR. FRIEDMAN;

The Court of Appeals announced the

rule in this cas.e.
Q

The whole point is the facts haven’t changed

from the time the case was filed until now.
haven't changed.

The facts

It's that the government took a little

time to catch up with the facts.
MR, FRIEDMAN:

[Laughter]

The Court of Appeals said—it

12
amended its opinion subsequently to read as follows—
Q

Where are you reading now?

ME. FRIEDMAN:

This is from an addendum to the

Court of Appeals opinion which is contained in Sister Egan's
brief in opposition in this case, at page 16? it's this
white documenfc.
What the Court of Appeals said was, "Since Sister
Egan has not yet been afforded a hearing regarding her
allegations of illegal electronic surveillance by the
government, for the purpose of this appeal we assume her
allegations to be true."

So, the Court of Appeals seems

to have announced a rule that, would, if the government has
not denied these allegations, the case will be decided on
the basis that those allegations are true, and it proceeded
to decide the case on that basis.
Q

It seems I’ve heard that someplace else in law,

that where allegations are made and not denied they are.
considered to be true.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Haven't I heard that someplace before?
That’s the normal rules of pleading»

Now, the other aspect of this case is that unlike
Mr., Gelbard or Mr. Parnas, both of these two ladies before
being called before the grand jury, were given full
transactional immunity, not the narrow use immunity but the
full transaction immunity, which means that neither of these
witnesses could be subject to any criminal prosecution or

13
penalty for any testimony they gave,

The facts with respect

to both of these ladies are very similar.
In January, 1971, Sister Egan, who is a Catholic
nun and the other respondent, Miss Walsh, is not, was
subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury sitting in
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania investigating various alleged
violations of the criminal code.

This is the same grand

jury that returned the indictment in the Berrigam case.
The first indictment in that case was returned two days
before, and Sister Egan was named as an unindicted coconspirator .
Sister Egan appeared before the grand jury and
refused to answer any questions, claiming that this would
violate her rights under the Fifth Amendment.

And following

this she was first given more limited so-called use
immunity and then the day after when it became apparent to
the government that she would continue to assart her
privilege under the Fifth Amendment, she was given the full
transactional immunity.
She was than called before the grand jury and
refused to answer any questions other than giving her name
and her address,

She was asked and refused to answer

approximately 70 or 80 other questions.

And following her

refusal, the District Court held her in civil contempt and
ordered her committed until she purged the contempt.

14
She cave six different grounds for refusing to
answer the questions.

And the pertinent one set forth at

page 54 of the record here—this is the provision relating
to the alleged illegal wiretap, number four at the top of
page 54, where she said;

'’The evidence on the basis of

which I have been named as a non-indicted co-conspirator,
subpoenaed to testify and answer questions was secured by
illegal wiretap.

In addition, all or some of the telephone

communications monitored by the United States Government
involve communications within the Roman Catholic Church of
America and specifically between my provincial headquarters
and the offices of the Church in I Jew York, Rome, and
throughout the United States."
The second witness, Miss Walsh, was called before
the grand jury in April of 1971, three months later.
was initially given full transactional immunity.

She

She

refused to answer all the questions put to her before the
grand jury, and the same thing happened.

Both of these

ladies were therefore held in civil contempt.

A divided

Third Circuit reversed by a vote of five to three.

All

members of the court, all five judges, agreed that the 1968
act gave a witness before a grand jury the right to challenge
the evidence which led the grand jury to

call the witness.

In addition, two of the judges also believed that the Fourth
Amendment gave the witnesses this right.

15
The government * s arguments in this case are
substantially the same as those which it. made in the last
case, both under the Fourth Amendment and under the statute.
And I would therefore like to turn briefly to the argument
that I was making when the Court—of the argument in the
previous case terminated.

And that is the applicability of

Section 3504 to this claim.

3504 is set forth at our brief

in the Egan case; at page 33, and I had previously indicated
that what it die was to limit the total amount of hearings
that would be required in cases of electronic surveillance
occurring prior to 1968.

It had that cutoff date.

And then it goes on and

says if there is any

hearing before a. grand jury upon a claim by a party aggrieved,
that evidence is inadmissible because it is the primary
product of an unlawful act, defined as electronic
surveillance, or the exploitation of such act.

The opponent

of the claim shall affirm or deny the occurrence of the
alleged unlawful act.
Although this refers to the making of such a claim
at a proceeding before a grand jury, the claim, to be
entertained, must be made by a party aggrieved.

And in

discussing this section, the legislative history speaks of
someone who makes a claim-—speaks of a claim by a defendant,
uses the word

by a defendant

the unfair practices.

with standing to challenge

A defendant is ordinarily not viewed

16

as someone who is a witness before a grand jury.

And,

furthermbre, standing comas again to the question I have
previously discussed as to whether or not—whether or not—a
mere witness before a grand jury has standing.
And it seems to us it would be most anomalous, we
think, that the Congress,which in this statute in 1970 was
attempting to reduce the volume litigation growing out of
claims of illegal electronic surveillance, would at the same
time have given to grand jury witnesses a right to
challenge evidence before a grand jury that they didn't
have under the 1968 act.

We think that the whole basic

purpose of this statute was to reduce the conount of
litigation relating to surveillances taking place before
June, 19S8.

And, indeed, the legislative history indicates

that Senator McClellan stated that this section was limited to
surveillance that occurred prior to June, 1958.
Of course, we deny any surveillance, but if there
was any surveillance in the case, it would appear that it
took place before that date.
I would like to now turn to another argument in
this case'—
Q

Before you leave 3504, if you’re going to leave

it now, is this the whole section, pages 33 and 34—
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Yes.

—-that relates to the Egan case?

It doesn't

17
say what happens after the opponent of the claim shall
affirm or deny the occurrence of the alleged unlawful act.
It stops in mic.-air.

It doesn't say what happens—

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think a fair reading of this

is if the government denies, that presumably is the end of
it unless—
Q

It doesn’t say so.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

It doesn't say so.

But it does go

on then to say that in the event, presumably if the government
admits it, it then goes on, it seems to me and that I think
is a preliminary determination.

The first thing to find out

is whether the government acknowledges it or denies it.

If

the government acknowledges it—
Q

You read it that if the government denies it,

that’s the end of it?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

I would think so.

That's not, I know, the issue here.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

And then if the government

acknowledges it, if they meet the standards of the two next
subsections, then you have the hearing on it.
Now, the argument is made by the respondents in
this case and by the position, adopted by some of the judges
in the Court of Appeals that it would violate Section 2514—
I'm sorry, 2510—if the government used this evidence before
the grand jury.

That is, the}/ say 2510 prohibits the use of

18
any evidence before the grand jury if the evidence is
obtained in violation of the statute? and, therefore, the
argument is that the District Court should not lend its
authority, in effect, tc permit or force the prosecutor to
violate the statute and commit a crime.
I think this argument fails to take 'adequate
account of the precise language of the statute.

The statute

says not that the receipt in evidence of any intercepted
communication that is prohibited if it violates the statute.
What it says is its prohibited if the disclosure of that
information would be in violation of this chapter»

That is,

the prohibition is the use before a grand jury or court of
any evidence if the disclosure of that would violate this
chapter*.

That's in Section 2515 at page 60 of the Egan

brief now—I have shifted to the Egan—■
Q

Of the respondents' Egan.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

Of the respondents' Egan brief. .

So, therefore, we must look to other sections of
the statute to ascertain what disclosure is prohibited.

And

the prohibitions on disclosure contained in 2511, which
begins at page 53 in the Egan brief, and the critical
sections, subsections (c) and. {d} on page 54, prohibit
willful disclosure or willful use of any intercepted
communication knowing or having reason to know that the
informat Lon was obtained through the interception in violation

of this subsection.

That is, the disclosure is only illegal

it seems to us, if in fact the person using if knew or has
reason to know.
In this case, assuming arguendo there was an
interception in this here, there is another provision in thi
statists, Subsection 3, pages 55 to 56, which was before this
Court several months ago in the Keith case, U. S. against
United States District Court, Subsection 3 at pages 55 to 56
which says nothing in this chapter shall limit the
constitutional power of the Pre sident--abou t halfway down
the first paragraph on page 56—''to take such measures as
he deems necessary to protect the United States against the
overthrow of the Government by force or violence or other
unlawful means, or against any other clear and present
danger to the structure or existence of the Government.”
Then it goes on and says, ’’The contents of any communication
intercepted by authority of the President in the exercise of
the foregoing powers may be received in evidence in any
trial hearing, or other px-cceeding only where such
interception was reasonable.”
Our position is that as long as it has net been
definitively determined that the interception \?ithcut a
warrant in national security cases is illegal—and the Court
of course, will decide that in the Keith ease—-at least as
long as that is the situation, the prosecutor could not be

20

charged with knowing or having reason to know that any
evidence obtained as the result of an allegedly illegal
interception of anyone's telephone conversation in this
field, that the disclosure of that would be in violation,
because the prosecutor as far as he was concerned had every
reason to believe that at least at that point it was
permissible to conduct any such electronic surveillance.
0
Ccise.

This argument you didn’t make in the last

It’s equally applicable to both cases, is it not?
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Oh, yes.

The argument you're now making.

MR. FRIEDMAN:
the last case.

Oh, yes.

In fact, it’s more applicable in

It’s clear in the last case, it seems to ms,

that a prosecutor who knows that the interception has
resulted from an order of the District Court cannot be
tried with knowing or having reason to know that it is in
fact illegal because of some allegations that there were
some irregularities in the thing.
Q

This argument is equally applicable to both

cases, except a little more so to the previous one.
MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

That’s right.

And not necessary, on the other hand, for you

to win either case.

It’s an alternative argument, is .it

not?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

That is correct.

21

Q

In both cases»

MR, FRIEDMAN %

That Is correct* Mr., Justice.

And in conclusion I’d

just like to say one other

thing, which is in this whole area it's very easy for
witnesses before a grand jury to make allegations that they
have been subjected to illegal wiretapping.

They are coming

all the time? the allegation is that they have been subjected
to illegal wiretapping»
In this case, at page 87 and 88, the record, is a
motion made by Miss Walsh for disclosure of electronic
surveillance.

And there’s a long list of things she wanted

to have disclosed, various things, and it’s not easy for
the government to answer these questions.

If, for example,

A3s telephone were tapped, over the period of a week they
might here hundreds of telephone—
Q

So, you say that the government really should

have the privilege of either complying with disclosure or
having litigated whether the person making the motion is an
aggrieved person, that you 3hould have the privilege of
saying» "You aren’t entitled to have your question answered"?
MR. FRIEDMAN;
Q

Precisely.

And even though that involves difficult

constitutional and statutory questions perhaps.
MR. FRIEDMAN:

We think that’s what the statute

provides, and we think the witness before the grand jury is

22
fully protected—
Q

So, when a witness says or when a-person makes
<

this motion for disclosure, as in this ease, and says, "1 am
an aggrieved person,

B, please disclose,” you say you may

deny that they are an aggrieved person and until that is
settled, even though it involves an appeal here, you don’t
have to disclose?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Because once this issue is decided,

Mr, Justice, hy this Court, whether or not a xv’itness is im
aggrieved person, it seems to me that will end that aspect,
of the litigation.
Q

Unless you lose.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Levine.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK J. LEVINE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. LEVINE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Courts
Let m2 say a word or two about the question that
has come up with regard to the procedural posture that this
case is in now.

The position that the government took in

the trial court was that they would refuse to affirm or
deny the existence of the surveillance not because they
didn’t know but because the witness had no such right.

And,

indeed, in the Court, of Appeals government counsel was asked
by Chief Judge Hastey, ::Do you want to take a position on

23

that?” or words to that effect.

And government counsel, as

1 recall, responded, "No, our position is that it6s
irrelevant because the witness doesn't have the right to
raise the issue.
There was no denial in this case until the
government filed its petition for certiorari.

And any

allegations with regard to the existence or non-existence
of surveillance in this case is outside of the record.
I might also say in that regard that inasmuch as
the government refused to affirm or deny surveillance in
the District Court, they also refused to say whether or not
a court order ox a national security tap was involved.

So

that to the extant that the government argues that it may not
be a violation of the criminal section of the statute, if
there is such a specification,their representation, I would
submit, is likewise irrelevant.

In the past it was decided

in the District Court and on appeal; the government refused
to say anything.

And on that basis the Court assumed that

there may have been surveillance and that, more important,
decided that the witness had a right to raise the issue and
had a right to get a reply from the government.
If we read the government's brief in the Egan case,
and indeed in the early portion of government's counsel
argument, there is an awful lot of discussion of the
exclusionary rule.

And I think it's most important to

24
analyze why it is that the government relies so heavily
upon what they call the exclusionary rule in past cases of
this

Court dealing with the use of testimony in subsequent

proceedings.
Their argument and their use of the exclusionary
rule is based upon a critical premise which, we submit, is
false.

And that premise is that Sister Egan in the trial

court sought to invoke the exclusionary remedy in order to
remedy a past and prior violation of her statutory rights
independent of what was happening in the grand jury.

And 1

would submit to this Court that that premise is false and
that really what we’re involved with here is a question of
whether or net it violates the law to compel within the grand
jury room, both statute and constitutional, within the
grand jury room divulgence and disclosure of illegally
ascertained conversations.

And when the Court asks the

question, What's the harm to the witness if the evidence
isn’t being used against him or her?, the ansvzer is that the
harm to the witness comes from the divulgence and the
disclosure which is prohibited by the statute.

And, as you

look at Section-Q

What is the disclosure in the grand jury?

If someone just asks a person about some events and it
doesn't involve quoting anything out of an overheard
conversation or even referring to it, but nevertheless it

25
had its roots in that conversation, is that disclosure?
MR. LEVINEt
use under--I forget;

I would submit that that would be
(c) is use and I think subsection (d)

is disclosure Under­
'S

What was involved in here, did you think,

disclosure of the conversations or us® or both?
MR. LEVINSs

Well, we never found out because

there was—
Q

What are we arguing about then?

What are we

arguing about nsw, quoting conversations or—
MR. LEVINE:

Questions as to the purport and

meaning of the conversation, what was said, and questions of
that kind.

I would suggest to the Court in that context

that the statutory definition of the contents of a
communication includes not only the actual words spoken
but the purport and content of the message.
And so, as we look at 2511 <c) and (d), we find
that not only has the actual interception been deemed an
invasion of rights of privacy, but the use in the disclosure
as well has been made a statutory crime.

And in addition

to 2511 (c) and <d>, we have 25X5 which has already been
referred to in the previous arguments.

2515 is an absolute

prohibition agarnst the use or introduction i.n a grand jury
of evidence obtained in violation of any provision of a
chapter.

And I might mention in that context, Your Honors,

26
that 2517, Subsection 3, specifically says that there can
be no testimony in a grand jury as to illegally*—as to
electronic surveillance, .evidence unless that evidence was
obtained by means authorised by the chapter.

So, not only-

do we have the criminal sanction in 2515, we have another
separate section which talks about use of evidence in a
grand jury on the condition that it's obtained by means
authorised under the statute.
The government has suggested that notwithstanding
the broad language of 25.15 and the existence of the
criminal sections and so on, that there is some limitation
imposed by the motion to suppress section, which is 2513,
Subsection 10(a).

The first requirement of 2518, 10(a},

is that Sister Egan by an aggrieved person, and an aggrieved
person is statutorily defined as a person whose own
conversations were intercepted, whose own wire or oral
communications were overheard.

There is no requirement that

such a person be a defendant in a criminal proceeding,

And,

indeed, Congress expressly rejected that condition in the
statute.

In 1967, Senator McClellan introduced a bill into
the Senate which defined "aggrieved party” as a defendant
in a criminal proceeding.

That bill wasn't passed, and in

1968 Senator Hrv.ska introduced a subsequent bill which
changed that language and defined "aggrieved person" as a

27
party to a communication„

The legislative history isn’t

cited in the brief, but a section-by-section comparison
of these two provisions can be found in the Congressional
Record rat Volume 114, Part 10, 90th Congress second session,
page 13,211»
In addition to the aggrieved party terminology—
aggrieved person terminology in the section—which Sister
Sgan. clearly is, there can be no doubt that a grand jury
inquiry constitutes a proceeding as that word is used in the
statute; and, indeed, Hale v. Henkel, which was mentioned
earlier by Mr. Justice Douglas, is most apposite in that
regard, as are cases like Cobbledick v. United States or
other cases which arise in the context of contempt hearings
held to adjudicate issues that arise in the grand jury.
And in addition to the meaning of the word
"proceeding," there can be no doubt that, a proceeding on an
order compelling testimony initiated by the government is
also a proceeding before a court under authority of the
United States, .$hich is the language in 2518, 10(a), and
hearing on a government application for contempt would
.t

likewise be covered by the statute.

And, indeed, Judge

Gibbons's dissent in the Egan case in the Third Circuit
concedes this point, concedes that notwithstanding any issue
es to whether or not a grand jury is covered, certainly a.
contempt application or hearing on an order to compel

28
testimony would be covered by the statute, and I believe
he refers to that as a non™issue„
The government draws—tries to draw—-support
from the omission of the term "grand jury" in 2518, 10(a).
And it parallels that omission with the omission cf
"legislative committees," and it says that those two
omissions indicate an intent on the part of Congress not to
make the 2515 remedy available to witnesses before such
bodies.
The reference to omission of legislative committees
is really very interesting, because the analysis—let me
step bade for a second.

As we've analysed 2518, 10(a),

we’ve drawn a distinction between the situation of an
actual witness as opposed to someone who isn't subpoenaed
and therefore not in the grand jury or not brought before
the court, a distinction between parties and non-parties#
and there is a very curious sentence in the legislative
t

history of 2518,, 10(a), from which we draw support for our
position on the distinction.
The sentence—and X believe it may have been
referred to by government counsel—in explaining

the omission

of legislative committees says, "Nor was this provision
intended to grant to the federal courts jurisdiction over
the Congress itself," and the case cited is Hearst v. Black.
I will come to Hearst v. Black in the sentence, but there

29

it; something very curious about the sentence from the
legislative history that I just spoke of.

Wot only does it

appear to contradict the inclusion of legislative
committees in 2515, it also appears to conflict with the
line of cases in this Court, most notably Watkins v. United
States f which do hold that the federal courts do have the
power, indeed the duty, to review the propriety of
congressional action if and when a legislative vf.itness is
brought to a contempt proceeding.

And then we turn to

Hearst v, Black which is cited in the government's brief.
Hoarst v. Black was a case in which a Senate subcommittee
subpoenaed telegraph records from the telegraph company and
not from Hearst.

Presumably those records related to

Kearst and he sought to intervene to prevent the committee's
use of those documents in its proceeding.

And what the

court raid v?as that inasmuch as Mr. Hearst hadn't been
subpoenaed, wasn’t before the committee, hadn't been ordered
to testify, he couldn’t intervene and simply stop the
proceedings.

It was significant the case went on to say

that if Hearst had been before the committee as a subpoenaed
witness, he would have the right to litigate the lawfulness
of the committee's action.

And that's precisely what we’re

talking about in our analysis of 2518, 10(a), when we say
there is a world of difference, and it’s not too hard to
ascertain, in‘answer to the question that Mr. Justice White,

30

I think, asked earlier between someone who subpoenaed and
therefore before the court to compel testimony or any
contempt hearing, and someone who isn’t subpoenaed.

There’s

a difference between Sister Egan who’s called in and
compelled to divulge and disclose her own conversation as
opposed to a third party agent or somebody else who comes
in and testifies without her knowledge.
Notwithstanding the fact that it would still be
a crime if the agent did it, she may not be able to stop
that.

And such a holding would be consistent with cases

like Hearst and Blue v, United States, which Is11 come to
in a moment,,

There is a very important distinction

between someone who is subpoenaed and is compelled to
testify and someone whose own right to privacy may have
been invaded but not by the actions of the prosecutor or the
grand jury or the court.
The subject of 18 U.S.C. 3504 has come up.
that that section is absolutely crucial.

X think

The government

has said that what could be more anomalous than Congress
using in 3504, widening the rights that had been made
available in Title 3, which was passed in 1968, because the
government's position is that Title 3 didn't give the witness
any right.

Weil, I suggest to the Court that it would be

very anomalous ;,£ 3504 had changed Title 3 and that in fact
it didn’t change Title 3 and that, moreover, the inclusion

31

of grand juries in 3504 was an express adaption of the
provision of Title 3 which had been enacted two years
earlier.
Moreoever, in that context the government's
position that since a witness isn't a party as such to a
grand jury proceeding, he or she doesn’t have any rights to
object to surveillance.

That position makes the plain

language of 3504 nonsensical because not only does 3504
include the term grand jury, it also talks about aggrieved
parties.

And clearly what that section--”
Q

In a grand jury who are the parties?

MR. LEVINE:
Q

Yes, sir.

ME,. LEVINE:
Q

Who are the parties?

Well, the witnesses in the proceeding—

There are no parties in a grand jury except

the government.

You don’t become a party until the government

indicts you.
MR. LEVINE:

I would suggest, sir, that you become

a party to a judicial proceeding if and when the government
seeks affirmatively to bring you in before a judge and seek
to use the power of the court to compel your testimony.
Q

Anyway, I thought the question of party was

party to an oral communication.

Aggrieved person means

party to an oral communication.

Is that what you're talking

about?

32
MR, LEVINE;

Yes,, sir.

I understood Mr. Justice

Marshall's question to be, Who would be a party to a grand
jury proceeding?
Q

Ain I correct?

My whole point was you were ^putting so much

emphasis on whether somebody was a party or not at a grand
jury, they are talking about aggrieved parties, they are
not talking abcut parties in the official sense in a grand
jury.
MR. LEVINE:
Q

No, Your Honor, I wasn't talking about

Well, that's what

MR, LEVINE:

I

was trying to find out.

I was talking about the significance

of being involuntarily made a party to a court proceeding
in which the evidence is sought to be compelled from you
and then further being made a party to a contempt proceeding.
And what our position is, and indeed there was no pretestimony motion to suppress filed in this case, is that if
and when the government seeks affirmatively to invoke the
power of the court, the court is duty-bound not to compel
testimony, to compel

divulgence and disclosure in express

violation of 2511 (c) and

(a)

, unless and until there has

; /been a determination that the surveillance x\»as lawful.
Q

Do you understand the government's position

to be that no one may challenge on the basis of being in
conflict with this act, the introduction of any evidence
before a grand jury?

33

HR. LEVINEs

Your Honor, are you talking about

course in document, like Blue—
Q

At any time.

MR. LEVINE?
Q

I would say—

The government clearly claims that no witness

before a grand jury may challenge the illegality of the
evidence which the government is using.
MR. LEVINE:
Q

Yes, sir.

How about anybody else?

HR. LEVINE:

The defendant can't challenge it because

he hasn't been indicted yet presumably, and once he is
indicted and you're presented with a Blue kind of situation,
then, he’s got adequate pre-trial, trial, and post-trial
motions that he can use.
Q

May the defendant challenge the indictment

itself?
MR. LEVINE:

So far as 1 know, there aren’t any

constitutional cases on that.
Q

I can refer the Court to—

It seems that 3504 at least contemplates the

possibility that somebody may be challenging the introduction
of some evidence before a grand jury some day.
MR. LEVINE:

2 would suggest that also in that

sense—in other words, because it talks about—
Q

It talks about a grand jury.

MR. LEVINE:

Yes,sir, and certainly a witness would

34
have that—
Q

I don’t know whether a witness would, but

they certainly seemed to contemplate that some exclusionary
arguments might go on before a grand jury in some context
in connection with somebody.
MR. LEVINE:
Q

Who are they?

MR. LEVINE:
Q

Yes, I would say that’s true.
Who are those people?

Well—

You say it’s the witness.
\

MR. LEVINE:
Q

Who else might it be?

MR. LEVINE:
Q

It’s clearly the witness.

I would—

Is there anyone else before a grand jury but

a x*?itness?
MR. LEVINE:

I can't think of anybody else, no.

Of course, I haven’t given it much thought.

I mean, it

appears to me that the whole—
Q

That’s your argument though, isn’t it?

MR.LEVINE:

Yes, sir, but as far as I can conceive,

a witness is clearly involved in a grand jury proceeding
and if and when he or she is brought to a contempt proceeding
or a proceeding on an order to compel grand jury testimony,
the witness would have the right to affirmance or a denial
of surveillance.
Q

Mr, Levina—

35
MR. LEVINE:

Q

Yes,'sir.

—is it your position that Section 2518, 10(a),

even though it doesn't expressly include the word "grand
jury," covers grand jury proceedings?
MR. LEVINE:
Q

Yes, sir, it is.

Low do you, account for the omission of the

inclusion of the term "grand jury"?
MR. LEVINE:

Your Honor, the only way that 1 can

account for it is by this distinction that I have drawn
between parties and non-parties.
Q

There can be parties and non-parties in any

number of situations.

That wouldn't go to the substantive

forum in which they were participating.
MR. LEVINEs

Well, yes, sir, it would,,

Take the

situation where there has been some illegal—-there has been
an invasion of privacy under the statute and the person whose
own privacy was invaded was not subpoenaed before the grand
jury but some third party was called as a witness to
introduce the tapes or whatever.

That would be a situation

in which the parson whose rights were invaded would, not be—
under 2518, 10(a)—-would not be able to keep that evidence
out of the grand jury, because he or she wasn't actually
put forth.

That's the kind of example I could think of of

a situation where right be being violated under—in a grand
jury—but it would make sense to exclude—-well, I'm not being

36
clear.

What I'm basically saying is that there are some

situations where you would have an invasion of rights in the
grand jury, but there wouldn't be an appropriate forum in
which the person whose rights were invaded would be able
to litigate the issue.

And traditionally the way these

cases have come up is that you don't get a decision from
the foreman of the grand jury cr whoever as to whether or
not your rights are being violated; you refuse to testify
for one reason or another and then you're brought before
the court.

And our position is that anybody who is put in

that position does have standing under the statute.
Q

Because it refers to the word "court."

You

say that is sufficient,, even though it doesn't mention
grand jury?
MR. LEVINE:

I think it's sufficient either way.

And I think that—•
Q

Why did Congress include "grand jury" in one

section and not in another?
MR, LEVINE:

Well, for the same reason that they

included "legislative committee" in one section and not in
another.

There may be situations where your rights are

being violated there, but inasmuch as you're not a party
there is nothing you can do about it in that context.

You

may be able ti file a civil suit or something like that.
That's the only way 1 can account for the omission, and I

37

think that for present purposes and in the way in which this
case arose the issue may not be crucial because there wasn't
any motion to suppress filed pre-testimony.

The issue

arose at the—there was a refusal fco answer and then the
witness. Sister Egan, was brought fco the hearing on the
application to compel testimony, and then the contempt
proceeding.
Now, really, I think it's important to understand
that what the government is. saying in this case is that
net understanding 2511 (c) and (d) and not understanding
2515 and not understanding 3504, that these statutes just
don’t apply because ’’grand jury" doesn’t mean grand jury,
it means something else.

And to divulge or use or disclose

doesn't mean that, it means something sis©.

And not only

are they urging that position for the proposition that the
witness doesn’t have standing, they are saying in addition
that when the witness

is brought before the court, the

court has got no power to do anything about it and, in fact,
has tc compel without choice the commission of a statutory
crime through the express provisions of 2511,

And I would

suggest to this court that that's an unacceptable
interpretation both of the statute and apart from the
statute under the supervisory power of this court, and I would
suggest a case like Elkins v. United. States where you've got
the imperative of judicial integrity involved and indeed

38
the express legislative finding in Title 3 in Section 801(h)
as enacted was the need to protect the integrity of court
and administrativa proceedings.

And I suggest to this

Court that Judge Wright was correct in his concurrent
opinion in the i). C. Circuit when he said that to hold
otherwise would be to stand our whole system of criminal
justice on its head.
Q

Mr. Levine—

MR. LEVINE:
Q

Yes, sir.

—what would have been your position in the

District Court if the government had done what it has done
in this Court and denied in the words of 7SO4 the occurrence
of the alleged unlawful act?
MR. LEVINE:

Denial by way of affidavit in the

absence of any «ivider.ce to the contrary has been accepted
by every court that has had this question before.

It has

happened in the Third Circuit since Egan came down.

It

has happened in the First Circuit—
Q

You mean if the government had come in with an.

affidavit and denied any wiretap and the interception of
any conversation with Sister Egan, that would have been
accepted without more?
MR. LEVINE:

Is that what you’re saying?
In the absence--! would say that's

probably what would happen, yes, sir,
Q

And then you would not have been here.

MR. LEVINE:

I think that’s right, yes.

think there is any question about it.

I don’t

Indeed, the other

cases which—Q

Nov? the government tells us here it does what

perhaps it should have done in the District Court.
MR. LEVINE:

Well, all I can say is that insofar

as Sister Egan is concerned, if they had done that there,
this case wouldn’t be here and sh& would have either
testified or been jailed.
Q

But in the posture—

Why shouldn't we let this go back to the

District Court and vacate everything that has come up here
and let it go back and start over again?
Q

Before Sister Egan would be sentenced to

contempt, though, without these legal issues being decided,
if she’s presented here, I suppose she ought to know, have
the opportunity to answer or not on the assumption that there
wasn’t any wiretapping.
MR. LEVINE:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I didn't follow

that.
Q

If a witness for a grand jury refuses to answer

on the assumption, because the government won't say anything
else, on the assumption that there has been illegal tapping,
that’s one thing.

But if she refuses to answer, knowing

that there hasn't been any taps, that’s' another thing.
MR. LEVINE:

Yes, sir.

40
Q

I just understood you to say that if that had

happened, she’d either be in jail with the keys to the jail
in her pocket, or she would have testified,
ME., LBVINE:

Yes, sir, and that’s what’s happening

in every—
Q

She has been adjudged in contempt.

MR. LEVINE:
Q

Yes, sir.

So, what we’d have to do would be vacate the

adjudication anS contempt and everything else that has
happened and go back and have the government file its
affidavit and deny that there was ever any tap or any
interception of any oral communication of hers, and that
then puts her in a position where she can go back before
the grand jury and testify or not? is that it?
MR. LEVINE;. Yes, sir, and that is what has happened
in. the Marcus case in the First Circuit and in the other
cases that have come up.

In other words, the government

took the position that she doesn't have a right to know
either way, and she said that she did and that's how the
ca3e came up on appeal.
Since then the government has taken a position—a
different, position-—in a number of cases and have filed
wiretap disclaimers.

They have done it in the Third Circuit,

the First Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, I believe, or the
Seventh Circuit, and indeed they have done it in the Ninth

41
Circuit in the Russo case-Q

I have the impression—I think I’m right—that

this Court has accepted disclaimers of wiretapping made by
the Solicitor General and acted on it without more»
MR. LEVINS:
Q

After the Alderman decision.

MR. LEVINE:
this.

You mean—

Well, she—I’m not sura I follow

But I—what I'm trying to say is that if in fact

there is a remand, it has to be for the purpose, I "would say,
of the government filing its affidavit, having her brought
before the court and said, "Okay, the issue is settled
now.

Will you or will you not testify?"
Q

That's what I’m suggesting.

MR. LEVINE:
Q

Yes, sir.

And vacate the present outstanding adjudication

of contempt to give her that Opportunity.
MR. LEVINES
Q

Yes, sir.

Unless you don't want to vacate it.

No, I don’t see how you—it seems to

me that—well, quite frankly I actually hadn’t thought about
this, to be perfectly honest with you.
be decided.
it.

The case is going to

If in fact it’s decided adversely to us, that’s

If it’s decided favorably to us, then there will be a

remand anyway for the same purpose that you just suggested,
that the government put the affidavit in—

42
Q

if we decided, we’re

deciding something of

a hypothetical case, are we not?
MR. LEVINE:

Well, not on the record before the

Court.
0

Well, it is now.

The Solicitor General says

there has been no wiretapping.
MR. LEVINEi

Well, first of all, the Solicitor

General is not the person that—
Q

Mr. Justice Brennan just suggested to you that

perhaps this Court in past cases have accepted here the
Solicitor General's representation that there hadn't been
any wiretapping.
Q

Even though nothing had been done of that kind

below.
MR. LEVINEi

Yes, sir.

Well, if in fact that’s

the case, then I would say that there's no difference.

But

there definitely has to be—-this affirmation has to be in
the record.
Q

Your point is, I suppose, that in the previous

case we're going to have to decide this issue,

and if we

accept the government's argument in the previous case, then
it doesn't make any difference whether or not there was or
was not a wiretap.
MR. LEVINE:
Q

Yes, sir.

And the government's right.

Then your client

43
has been rightfully held to be in- contempt, even under the
assumption, contrary to the fact as it now presently
appears, there was illegal wiretapping.
MR. LEVINE:
Q
previous case.

Yes, sir.

The issue--

The issue is going to be decided in the
That's your point, isn't it?

MR. LEVINE:

Right.

Regardless of what happens,

one way or another the issue is going to be decided.

If it's

decided adversely to us—
Q

I just don't understand that.

Why should your

client be in contempt no matter how we decide the other case?
If the affirmation of denial is made below and she goes and
is willing to appear and testify before the grand jury, and
because we decide the other case in the government's favor,
why should she have gone to jail?
MR. LEVINE;

I’m sorry, I thought what I was saying

before was that she can’t be held—i in fact there is a denial
on the record—she can’t be held in contempt until when
confronted with that she says—
Q

That's right.

And she says that unless she

v7on't appear to testify—
MR. LEVINE;

That’s right, yes, six*.

I'm sorry.

When I say that's what happened in the Marx case, that’s
exactly what happened in the Marx case,
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

REBUTTAL BY MR. FRIEDMAN
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Brennan,- S think it’s important to look at page 46—
Q

Which brief now?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
Q

Which case then?

MR. FRIEDMAN:
case.

—of the government's petition.

This is in this case, in the Egan

Forty-six of the government's petition which

contains the opinions of the Court of Appeals, the very last
sentence of the opinion says, "The judgment of contempt
would be vacated and the case remanded for a hearing to
determine whether the questions propounded to Sister Egan
resulted from illegal electronic surveillance directed at
her."
Q

Oh, you mean it has already been vacated,

the contempt?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

Yes, the contempt has bean vacated

because the Court of Appeals has reversed the District
Court’s decision, determination, of contempt, and has said
that Sister Egan was entitled to litigate this issue in
this context.

45

Q

The Court of Appeals decided the questions on

the merits.
MR. FRIEDMANs
Q

That's correct.

Without knowing whether there was electronic

surveillance or not.
MS. FRIEDMANs

That is correct.

And, of course,

our position, as I've indicated, is that we do not think in
this situation she is entitled basically under the statute
to litigate this issue at all.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Gentlemen, the case is

submitted.
[Whereupon, at 3:08 o’clock p.m, the case
was submitted.!
