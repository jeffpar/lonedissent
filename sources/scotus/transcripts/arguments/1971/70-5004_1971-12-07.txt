MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We911 hear arguments next

in Humphrey against Cady, 5004.
Mr. Cfcame, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVIN 3. CHARNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CHARNE:

Mr. Chief Justice,, and may it please

the Courts
This is here on writ of certiorari to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.

And I

represent the petitioner, Donald Gilbert Humphrey, who presented,
as the Court knows, his handwritten petition to this Court
without the benefit of counsel,
Mr. Humphrey's case commenced -— started hack in May
of 1967.

On May 30, 1967, he was arrested in the State of

Wisconsin, Waukesha County, which is the county adjacent to
Milwaukee County, and charged with the offense of contributing
to the delinquency of a child.
This is a misdemeanor in the State of Wisconsin,
carrying a maximum penalty of one year.
We don't have the record, Your Honor, of that initial
proceeding here; however, in his petition to this Court for
writ of certiorari, Mr. Humphrey said he was sitting in a car
and drinking beer with a boy who was almost 14, he was 13 at
the time.

And this is, X think, in Wisconsin a very frequent
type of case, of contributing to the delinquency of a minor,
It’s against the law for a minor to drink beer, and if an adultgives him an alcoholic beverage, you are then contributing to
the delinquency of a minor.
So that is, apparently, the offense for which he was
arrested May 30, 1967.
The next day, May 31, 1967, he was in courtt he pleaded
guilty to the offense, and the court, under the Wisconsin Sex
Crimes Act, committed him for a presentence examination.
Q

But the conviction was not for a sexual offense?

MR, CHARNE:

Ho, Your Honor, it was for contributing

to the delinquency of a child.
How, then
Q

pardon me.

Yes?

I don’t follow this.

You mean that in Wisconsin,

even though it’s not a sexual offense —■
MR. CHARNEt

Well, Your Honor, I will explain what the

Wisconsin Sex Crimes Act covers.

In Wisconsin, under our Sex

Crimes Act, there are two categories of sex crimess
One category is that which calls for a mandatory
sentence under the Sax Crimes Act, and that includes the
offenses of rape, attempted rape, sexual intercourse without
consent, and indecent liberties with a child.
convicted of those you automatically

If you are

go in the: system.

However, the Wisconsin statute provides that any

5
other offense except, homicide or attempted homicide can also
be a sex crime.

It is a sex crime if the court finds that the

defendant was probably directly motivated by a desire for
sexual excitement in the commission of the crime.

If the

court finds —
Well, this could be shoplifting or arson or —

q

MR. CHARNE:
an X rated movie.

Yes,

Yes, Your Honor, or sneaking into

If the court finds that the defendant was

probably directly motivated by a desire for sexual excitement
in the commission of the crime, this becomes a sex crime in
the State of Wisconsin.
Q

Well, what kind of evidence does the judge take

to make that determination?
MR. CHARNEi Wall, this is one of cur complaints,
Your Honor, because I don't think the statute requires any
evidence.

It does not require £ hearing on that issue.

we don't have a record as to what happened.

And

But we do have a

record — what's in the record shows that this man was arrested
May 30th, he was convicted on his plea of guilty to the crime
of contributing to the delinquency of a child on May 31st, and
sent away >for a presentence examination under the Sex Crimes
Act.
Q

Well, as you say, we don't have a record.

We

have his say-so that he was sitting in an automobile with a
juvenile of the same sex drinking beer? but ha doesn't say what

6
©Ise was going on.
MR. CHARMS: Well# in his petition to this Court# Your
Honor# he says that that's all that was going on# and he says
that ha and the boy were put under considerable pressure to
testify that something else went on# and both of them denied
it.
Q

Yes.

MR. CHARNE:

He also says the boy was sent to a

hospital for medical examination# and that there was no evidence
of any sexual molestation.
So, it’s unfortunate that we don’t have that record,
but teat is what the evidence is.
Now, we do have the court's order of commitment#
which doesn’t indicate any hearing on that particular issue.
He was sent away on May 31st and on July 24th the report came
back from the Department that had examined him# and that’s
found —• the order then# the court entered an order which is
found in the Appendix# on page 11,

That’s part of the record.
1

And the court says nothing about the basis of its
finding teat this was a sex crime.

It says that he was sent

away# and the report of the Department cams in, and# based upon
that report# he sentenced him under tee Wisconsin Sex Crimes
Act.
He was sent to Waupun State Prison, which at that time
was the facility designated for Sea Crimes Act people; it was

7
not a hospital, it‘a the Waupun State Prison®
Q

Do we have the report?

MR® CHARNE:

Wo, we do not have the report, Your

Honor» That is not in the record.
Q

We do know, do we, that it was the rocontaenchrbion

of the Department that your client was in need of specialised
treatment for his mental aberrations «- and I'm reading from
your brief.

Do we know that?

MR. CHARNEs
Q

I believe so, yas?»

Yes, sir.

Yes

MR, CHARNEs

The judge says that in his order.

Incidentally, the order of the judge also indicates that on the
dev when he was sent away, that there was no attorney present»
It says that the report came back on July 24th, and the
appearances were:

the State of Wisconsin appearing by Robert

Evans, Assistant District Attorney in and for Waukesha County,
and. the defendant appearing in person»
So that on that day when he commenced his sentence
under the Sex Crimes Act, apparently there wasn't even a
/

hearing on that day.
Now, then he went “*•
Q

Mow, what is the sentence under the Sex Crimes

Act?
MR. CHARNEs

Nov;, the sentence under the Sex Crimes

Act is an indef inite period of time in these segments s

First, you go for the maximum period for which you
could have been sentenced —■
Q

That’s a year.

MR. CHARNEs

Yes.

— under the offense.

Then the Department, if it believes that you are
dangerous — if there is danger to the public for releasing
you *— orders you extended, and that order is subject to
review of a court, and they can extend you in five-year
increments without limit.
s

Q

What happens, again?

MR. CHARNEs

At the end of one year, or a little

less than a year, in April of I960 -- in other words, he had
bean sent away July 24th of "67, in April of 1968 the Departme
issued its order saying that this should be extended for
another five-year period.
Q

But you say a judge has to confirm that?

MR. CHARMS:

Yes.

Then the Department applied to

the County Court of Waukesha County to confirm that order.
Q

Same judge

MR, CHARNEs

who issued the sentence?

And it goes back before the same judge,

but it turned out the judge wasn’t there, and someone else
was filling in for him.

So another judge, then, heard the

matter and there was a hearing on July 23.. of 1968, on the
order of the Department to extend him.
Q

But by this time he had counsel, didn’t he?

$
This is when he had the lady lawyer, is it not?
MR. SHARKSs

Yes, he had the lady lawyer on July 23«

Mrs. Neff, who —
Q

Well, he had counsel when he pleaded guilty..

didn't he?
MR. SHARKS:
i

Yes, he did, Year Honor.
■■

He had counsel

•

whan he pleaded guilty to the original offense, and it
doesn't

> the record doesn't indicate why that counsel wasn't

called at the tirae he was actually sentenced.
Q

But the hearing which came after the guilty

plea, he was uncounseled, isn't that right?
MR. CHARME:
Q

If there was & hearing, Your Honor, yea.

They refer to it sometimes as a hearing, but

let's call it the occasion.
MR. CBARNE:
Q

Yes.

The occasion when he was informed where he was

going to be sent, there was no counsel, present?
MR. CK&RME:

That is correct, Your Honor, according

to the order of the court.

That is, the only record we have

of that is the court’s order, and it doesn't recite the presence
o£ any counsel for him.

It says "the defendant appearing in

person*’.
Q

Mow, then, I gather, he was extended for five

years, until what date?
MR. CHARNEs

Yes, Your Honor, he was extended for

ID
five years, which would have made it. 1973.

However* ha was

paroled, this year, earlier — in March of this year he was
paroled.

So that at the present time he is on parole.
But at the time when he was brought back on this

hearing to confirm

the extension order of five yearsr he was

there represented by Mra. Neff.
Q

May I just go over it one© more?

MR. CHARNE:
Q

Yes, sir.

Did 1 understand you to say that at the end of

his five years, suppose ha was recalled from parole, might there
be another five years?
MR. CHARNE:

Oh, yes.

spend the rest of his life.

It’s very clear,

He could

There is no time limit , except

that there are five-year increments, arid it must be confirmed
by a court.
0

The extension requires a finding, X understand,

that he would be a clanger to society if released? is that it?
MR. CHARNE:

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

That in the opinion of -the Department his release
would be dangerous to the public.
Q

If you know, in those extension proceedings,

is the subject represented by counsel usually?
MR. CHARNE:

I believe that he is, Your Honor.

X

know that the Wisconsin Supreme Court has said he should be.
There’s a case in Wisconsin, the Huebner case, which

11
the court sat out the procedural requirements and clearly
indicated that a person is entitled to counsel and should .be
represented by counsel.
Q

Is that Wisconsin case cited in your brief?

MR. CHARMS:
Q

Oh, yes, I see it, H-u~e~b~n-e“-r,

MR,, CHARMS:
Q

Yes, it isr Your Honor.

That’s right, Your Honor.

Has the Supreme Court laid down any standards

of proof?
MR, CHARMS:

Well, they talk about dangerous in this.

Your Honor, but they have not really, I think, explained what
dangerous means, other than it doss not necessarily mean
physical harm.
Q

They pointed —
Well, would it have to ba a danger because of

sexual aberrations?
MR,, CHARNE:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

don’t believe that it’s limited*

I

Tha statute certainly doesn't

say that, and I am not aware of any Wisconsin case that says
that it must be limited to sexual problems.
Q

Well, this hospital, which X think you said is

a hospital, or at least an institution for deviates, sexual
deviates?

MR. CHARHEs

Wo*

At the time when he was sent there,

Wisconsin had no separate facility for sexual deviates.

The

Appendix to the Respondent’s brief her© points out one of the

12
problems in Wisconsin of getting J'aoney to build an appropriate
facility *

They didn't have it, and they
Q

Was there treatment of any kind there?

MR. CHABNSs

Well, it's questionable.

With the case

people have had group therapy.

And that was considered suffici­

ent treatment.
The question of treatment for ~~

This is just a prison, is it?

Yes, sir? it's a prison.

It was the

released as having recovered?
MR. CHARMSs

I don't know, Your Honor.

otar — Mr. Humphrey was paroled.

I know that

He's on parole at the present

time, so apparently they thought it was all right to release
him.

Mow, whether they would fry to exercise continued

control when his time's up, I don't know.
Q

But this extension of one year is predicated

upon the premise that the person has recovered?
MR. CHARHEs
Your Honor,
0

Yes.

It's an extension of five years,

In five-year increments.
Right.

And when you say this is just a prison,

does this mean that everybody just gets extended because there's
no treatment and no recovery in this institution?

13

ma CHARNE:
Honor.

No» I wouldn't say that’s correct» Tour

Apparently» either the institutionalisation itself or

the group therapy sessions that are held» for some reason»
persuades the officials r as to this man for examplet that they
could release him»

So, in their minds, something happens.

Whether it actually

whether there’s a difference or not, 1

am sure that Mr. Humphrey wouldn’t agree that he received an*
treatment.

I think in hie papers that he filed in this and

the lower courts —

Q

Of course he would not agree that he needed any.

MR, CHARNE s

That’s right, Your Honor? I’m sure

that’s true.
Q

Well, what would be the basis upon which they

could terminata parole?
MR. CHARNEs
q

Would it have to be a sexual offence?
No.

Or could it be /some other offense?

MR. CHARNE%

I know that he — his parole

conditions, suppose he — I know of a case now where a man
was found on drunken driving.

Now, it’s

you’re not supposed

to drink when you’re on parole, and if you’re found drunk,
that they could -q

in other words, the termination of parole is on

the grounds that any prisoner on parol® might be terminated?
MR. CHARMSt
Q

That's my understanding, four Honor, yes.

Does this record -*■* I suspect it does not, but

you may know — does it reflect whether there are psychiatric
facilities or clinical psychologists at the Waupun Prison?
MR, CKARNE:

X believe there are some psychiatrists

on the staff and also some psychologists, social workers on
the staff.

There are, Your Honor,

And Wisconsin now has

recognised the need for additional treatment.
X think the Respondent's brief indicates that
commencing in this year, in 1970, people are now being
committed to what is called the Central State Hospital, which
is an institution for the criminally insane in Wisconsin.
That is a change, and the Wisconsin Department
recognizes the need for a special institution for those types
of offenses, but they don't have it yet.
Q

Well, doss Wisconsin have a general State

prison?
MR. CKARNEs
Q

Yes, it does.

And this is not it?

MR. GHARMEs

That's it.

The place where this man

was sent was the maximum security institution of the State of
Wisconsin,

Waupun Prison is the place where felons go.
Q

If his parole were to be revoked, do you have

any idea where ha would end up?
MR. CHARMS:

Now?

I don't know know, Your Honor.

X know

that the recommendations were that those people who were in
Waupun at the time that they transferred the

new commitment

15
went to the Central State Hospital, but they said that those
who had started in one place would continue there.
Now, 3: don't know what would happen to him if ho were
sent back, where he would bo sent»

I believe that that is an

administrative function by the Department,
I think I had gotten, in my chronology, to the point
where the Department had asked to extend him for five years,
and it came up for a hearing and he was then represented byMrs, Neff, who was appointed by the court to represent him*
ho being indigent at the time,
Mrs, N@£f advised him that ho should not cooperate
with court-appointed psychiatrists who were present in court
on the day of the hearing, and said she intended to raise the
constitutional issues.
The court asked for her to file briefs then, and it
was agreed,

A briefing schedule was set up.

And then,

apparently, nothing further was heard from Mrs, Neff.

The

court record indicatas that the judge wrote a letter to her
and said;

If we don't hear from you, we're going to confirm

this order.
And then, the next thing that happened is, in
November the order was entered, November 20, 1988.

Judge

Bjork, who was the substitute judge, signed an order confirming
the extension for five years.

And in his order, which is found

in the Appendix or. page 14, he recites the fact that he had

16
expected to get briefs, end he say3, "the matter having been
adjourned for the. purpose of filing briefs to support the
respective positions of the State and tho defendant? and no
briefs having been filed? and the court having directed
correspondence to Mrs. Alyea T. Neff, dated October 15th, 1368,
advising Mrs, Hoff that the absence of the filing of briefs
and any affirmative acts for and on behalf of the defendant
with regard to this matter, the court would presume that the
defendant did not intend to offer any proof as to his condition,
and the order ... would stand".

And, accordingly, he confirmed

the order.
So here you have a man represented by an attorney
who didn’t do anything at the hearing, no cross-examination —
there were no witnesses presented as to the State's position?
and

then

she said, "I’m going to argue this on a constitutional

basis'4, and then she didn't file any briefs.
So it is our position that that type of representation
is equal to nothing.
Q

Have you included in your claim of inadequate,

ineffective assistance of counsel the advice given to your
client not to cooperate with the doctors?
MR. CHASSIS5

No, I don't, Your Honor, because I think

that that — you know, that there may be a basis for — to say,
it is up to the State to show this man's condition. And
according to the State order they claim that they had had a

previous psychiatric examination of him.

They «aid that; on

the records and files,, based upon his commitment, they believe
he's dangerous.
So I think that they could come into court, based
upon what they have, and show the judges

wJudge, here's the

reason that we think this man should he continuedw.

tod it is

not incumbent upon the defendant to come into court on the day
of the hearing, have two strange doctors brought in by the
judge, and expect the doctors to do a good examination of him
in, you knew, in a short period of time while you’re waiting
for this case to be heard,
And 1 say that 1 don't think that

right to have his own psychiatrist come in under the statute

Q

Does it say anything about the judge ~~

MR. CHARNEs

No, I don't think it does, Your Honor.

I don't know what the basis of having these two doctors there
was, unless' there was something in the record — we don't have
tills — that indicates somebody asked for them,

I don't know

what they were doing there.
Q

Well, here, I’m just reading from your brief on

page 5 —
MR. COARNE;
Q

Yes.

— there’s a statement about the 12th line downs

"On advice of his court-appointed counsel, the petitioner
refused to submit to an examination by a doctor or psychiatrist,
of his own choosing prior to the hearing".
MR. CHARNEs
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Prior to the hearing,

MR. CHARNEs

Yes.

In other words, he did not ask to

have the judge appoint a doctor for him.
Q

Well, it. was more than just not asking, he

refused to cooperate by selecting a psychiatrist of his own
choice and submitting to examination.

And apparently he was

19
doing that, not of his own choice but because his lawyer at
that time
MR, CHARNE:
Q

Yes.

*— advised that he do that*

HR. CHARNEs

Yes.

I think the language '’refused to

cooperate84 is really the judicial language, when you ara
asking me, Your Honor, whether I consider that to be poor
advice or whether I base my charge of lack of adequate
representation on that, I wouldn't say that that was.

Because

I'm not. sure that the lawyer was improper in directing him
not to have a previous examination.
result of that would have been,

I don't know what the

I am not claiming that that is

that kind of error.
In any ©vent, he was extended for five years, and ther
after that extension he then commenced the series of procedures
which has brought him here.
He applied to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

In

,

i

October of 1969 ha filed a petition there for a writ of habeas
corpus and it was denied — without counsel, it was denied
without hearing, and without even asking for a response.
And then he want to the United States District
Court, and finally we have gotten now to this Court.
Now, what are the points that we wish to raise with
regard to his treatment?

I think the first thing I want to

point out is the difference, the disparity between the treatment

50

of a man under the Wisconsin So:?: Crimes Act, and especially,
T s ay, those which are the *— not the mandatory, not raps?
but any other crime where tine judge finds it may be sexually
motivated —
Q

Did he have a hearing, then, on federal habeas

in the District Court?
MR. CHARNEt

No, he did not have a hearing. Your

Honor» . There was a response filed by the State, but it was
denied without a hearing.
Q

Just on the pleading?

MR. CHARNEf

Yes, Your Honor.
*»

G

And the absence of hearing, is that a question

that was raised in the Court of Appeals?
MR. CHARNE:

peculiar posture.

No, Your Honor.

This case has a very

The trial court denied him a certificate of

probable cause, so he couldn’t appeal.

Then he filed an

application for a certificate of probable cause to the Court
of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and that was denied.

And

then he filed a petition with this Court, and it was granted.
So that this case has never been heard by the Court
of Appeals, and there was no hearing in the District Court.
Q

Well, what, would you —- as of now, what do you

suggest is the most expeditious way of unraveling this?
MR. CHARNEx

Well, if the Court please, it is my

view that, the Wisconsin statute on its face:, which I think we

21
can look at without going into the factual thing, is improper *
It’s unconstitutional.

And that the Wisconsin Supreme Court

has so interpreted that statute as to be in conflict with this
Court’s decision in the Basesfcresa case.
In the Baxstrom case, which was the case in New York
where you had a person who had been sentenced on an assault
charge, I think it was second-degree assault, so certainly you
have soma question of physical danger there, a man was sentenced,
I think, to about two and a half years.

And toward the end ■

of his sentence, they filed a petition saying this man is
insane, he requires mental treatment.
So then there was a proceeding and he was committed
to, in effect, a criminal type facility for treatment.

And it

came to this Court, and this Court compared that treatment that
he got with what a person under a civil commitment was
entitled to in the State of New York, and said that the
statute was unconstitutional because that person should have
been entitled to the same treatment a person civilly committed
got o
Now, I think that’s very applicable to the State of
Wisconsin.

Here we have a person who — our man, he gets

sentenced on 'the crime of contributing.• to the delinquency of a
child, and then, at the end of one year, which is the maximum
for which he can be sentenced, he’s again committed.
Now, there’s a great difference between that and what
i

22

would happen if he were civilly committed, because he is not
entitled to a jury trial,, and under the Wisconsin Mental
Health Act, which we set forth, every person in Wisconsin who
is committed civilly is entitled to have that question
determined by a jury.
Q

And under the Mental Health Act would he be

committed as a sex deviate?
MR. CHARNEs

Under the Mental Health Actr he would

bo committed if he were:

mentally ill, infirm, or deficient.

Now, mentally ill means a mental disease requiring
care for -the welfare of yourself or others or the community.
Q

That might include sexual aberrations?

MR. CHABNE:

Yes, X think it might include him.

Now, the Wisconsin —
Q

And. under that he’d have a jury trial?

MR. CHARNEs
Q

Yes, he would, Your Honor.

Whereas, under the Sex Crimes Act, lie gets

neither that ncr any other process except that which you
described here?
MR. CHARMS;

Yes.

He is entitled — he’s entitled to

re-examination under both the Mental Health Act and the Sex
Crimes Act,but even there there’s a difference.

Under the

Sex Crimes Act, you are not entitled to ask for a re-examination
until you have served the maximum period for which — under the
crime.

In other words, in our brief v?e say if you’re
sentenced for rape, for example, under the Sex Crimes Act,,
that1© a 30-year maximum.

You can’t ask for a re '-examination

of your mental condition for 30 years,
Now, under the Mental Health Act in Wisconsin, '■■von
you are committed, you can ask for a re-examination at any
time after recommitment, and you get a hearing and a jury,
and then you can ask for re-examination but not — you can’t
require it more frequently than once a year.
Now, under the Sax Crimes Act, you have to wait, until
you serve the maximum, and then you can ask for a re-examina­
tion, and at the re-examination you do not get a jury trial.
In addition —•
Q

Pardon me.

Let me be sure of one thing, though.

Had he pleaded not guilty to the original charge, ha would have
had a jury trial?
MR. CHARNE:

Yes, Your Honor, on the criminal charge/

there's no question, he would be entitled to a jury trial.
Q

And then if he’d been found guilty by a jury,

all of these procedures would have been — could have been
invoked, could they not?
MR. CHARNE %

Yes, Your Honor.

The thing, the jury,

though, would not pass upon the question of whether he was
sexually — whether the offense was sexually motivated.

In

other words, this is something which the judge adds onto the

criminal proceeding.

If you have a criminal charge levied

against you* the issues ares
Hera the man says*
Q

did you commit that offense?

Yes, 1 gave beer to a minor? I’m guilty.

Well, this, then, is just a matter of sentence

for commitment, Isn’t it?
MR. CHARNE;

So then you have the question of

exposing him to this new proceeding.
Q

That's in the sentencing procedure, isn’t it?

MR. CHARMS*

It is, it's in the sentencing part of it.

But it is —

If he pleads guilty or is convicted by a jury,

this process is applicable?

It’s of long standing, though?

MR. CHARNE:

Yes, it. is of long standing.

Your Honor, in connection with that, I am sorry that
X didn’t get ahold of this until just a few days ago, this is
an excellent book, The Mentally Disabled and the Law, which is
published by the American Law Foundation in Chicago, the
University of Chicago Press, and has a very good discussion of

this whole area.

You may, if you wish,

call our attention to that by a supplemental memorandum.
MR. CHARMS;

X would appreciate doing that, Your

reserve those.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE L» FREDERICK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FREDERICK;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court;
I represent the respondent here, Warden Elmer Cady,
Warden of the Wisconsin State Prison,
Perhaps it would be well to begin by dealing with
some of the questions that were put to Mr. Chame.
The question on the section, as far as discretionary
commitment is concerned, is dealt with in Section 975.02, which
provides that if there — a sex crime is defined there as one
in which the desire for sexual excitement existed in the
commission of the crime.

And it provides that the court may

26

take testimony after conviction if necessary to determine that,
issue.
Q

Let8s assume —

Q

Do you agree —excuse

Q

Go ahead.

Q

Do you agree that that’s

me.

not the crime he was

charged with?
ME. FREDERICKS
Justice.

Well, let me clarify that, Mr, Chief

The charge in — the way the charge is booked is

Section 957.15, subsection Cl), subsection (a), which is
contributing to the delinquency of a child.

■i

The Sex Crimes Act then comes into play, Your Honor,

just as — or the closest analogy would be the Habitual
Criminal Statutes, which we have in Wisconsin, Section 939.62,
where the enhanced punishment as a repeater comes into
operation not as an additional charge but as an enhancement of
punishment.

But there is a separate finding and the defendant

is given notice before he pleads to the offense.
And of course this is our contention, preciselyi
that, here — I've got to stand here and I can’t say anything
outside the record, but it’s an inference, I believe, Your
Honor, from the Huebner case and the other cases I cite in
my brief, such as Reppin, that the practice was, when this
defendant entered his plea of guilty, that he was informed
that he might be subjected to the disposition under -the Sen

2?
Crimes Act.
Now, the purpose for the discretionary element on
these crimes other than the three mandatory ones is this:
if you charge a man with incest, why is it necessary to take
additional testimony on that to show that sexual excitement
existed in the commission of the crime?
On the other hand, when yen charge a man with
contributing to the delinquency of a minor, then it is apropos
to take the testimony, and —
Q

Suppose he were charged with larceny of a watch?

May 'this feature then be triggered?
MR. FREDERICK;

In larceny of a watch, Your Honor,

it would be treated like thist

that would require a separate

hearing to show that this particular individual was one of
the small group that got sexual gratification from stealing
the property of others, just as some people —
Q

Am I to gather then, Mr. Frederick, this may

be triggered foy a conviction for any offense?

Any crime, may

it not?
MR, FREDERICK;

Except that the courts, the Wisconsin

Supreme Court, Your Honor, has giver?, the — what should I say —telegraphed to prosecutors and judges that by the Ruebner
decision, that you’re not going to be able to stray too far
afield on this.

They're going to require some direct

substantiation that the crime involved was in fact motivated by

a desire for sexual gratification,

I think as we get further

and further afield it becomes harder to show.
Q

Well, Mr.Frederick, Justice Brennan5s question,

however, so far as the statute goes, has to be answered yes —
MR. FREDERICK:
Q

— except for homicide and attempted homicide.

MR. FREDERICK:
Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Those are the exceptions made by the statute.

MR. FREDERICK:
Q

Yes.

I agree.

I feel —

And my question is, let's assume a prosecution

for shoplifting, and the psychologists, psychiatrists tell u.~
that often shoplifting is motivated or* this statutory basis,
or for arson, and let's assume a conviction for shoplifting.
Then what is it that triggers this extra procedure?
the prosecuting attorney does it?
his own motion?

Does the ■

Or does the judge do it on

Or what is it that gives the court the idea

of the motivation that triggers this extra procedure in this
particular shoplifting cases as against some other shoplifting
case, that this one might come under this Wisconsin Sex Crimea
Act?
MR. FREDERICK:
Q

All right, Your Honor, now «—

What kind of offer, from either the statute or

from what happened in this case?
MR, FREDERICK:

Mow, in 1967, Wisconsin adopted the

manifest injustice test for acceptance of the plea of guilty.

29

At that time, of course, we began to attempt to
comply with Federal Rule 11 in that the trial judge had to
ascertain that the acts the person allegedly committed
constituted the offense.

So in the course of adducing that

information on a guilty plea, this information micrht well come
to the trial judge’s attention or, you’re quite correct, the
district attorney could call it to the judge’s attention? and,
surprisingly enough, four Honor, defense attorneys may well
call this to the court's attention, because -Q
trigger it?

How about the probation report?

Could that

She presentence report*

MR. FREDERICK? The presentence report could, and
of course on a trial on the merits, then it would become, or
might become quite obvious that —
Q

Or it might not, at all.

It might just be

evidence that this particular person stole so much from a
department store, period.
MR. FREDERICK; That’s true.

And before the

disposition under the Sex Crimes Act could be sustained, Your
Honor, there would have to be a finding made on these by the
judge, on the record, that the necessary sexual gratification
in connection with the crime was present.
Q

Well, it’s not clear to me, still, as to what

the motivation, what the trigger is, what the source is of this
extra hearing, after a plea of guilty or a conviction.

30
MR» FREDERICK:

Well, let me be frank with you then,

Your Honor
Q

I would appreciate it.

MR. FREDERICK:

-— the same reason is why I always

charge the repeater statute anet the guys down the hall in the
prosecutor’s office never did.

It was my unbridled discretion,

in effect, whether to charge a repeater or not,
Q

Well, then, you mean there are some prosecutors

who charge this with respect to every offense?
MR. FREDERICK:
Q

No.

No.

This person is guilty of stealing a horse and

on top of that wIsnr charging that he was sexually excited by
stealing the horse”?
MR. FREDERICK:

No, all the prosecutor can do in

Wisconsin, Your Honor, is to charge the principal offense of,
in this case, contributing? and then, if and only if the trial
judges asks for some recommendation as to disposition is the
defendant likely to be subjected to the Act.
And in Wisconsin we have the rule that the
prosecutor's recommendations are not at all binding on the
trial judge.

Every defendant knows that.

So we have vary

little, just as in the repeater statute, very seldom is the
enhanced sentence given.
Q
objective test:

Well, with the repeater statute, you have an
does this person have a record of prior

31
convictions?

Theress no such objectivity under this statute.

I s til 3- don’t understand what triggers this post-convicti on
procedure , if anything.
Q

Some tiling must.

Let me be a little more specific, is it

automatic almost, in practice, when there is a charge of
contributing to the delinquency of a minor?
MR. FREDERICK:

No, it isn’t automatic, Your Honor.

And what triggers it is bast, I think, set out in the Torpy
case, which I cite in my brief.

The procedure is, in Wisconsin

as in every place else in the Union, that you often charge lass
than the facts warrant.

And this is a vary good clue to the

judge, of course, if the principal charge was in fact one of
the mandatory offenses, and the prosecutor moves to amend it
because he says, "Your Honor, I feel that I cannot maintain my
burden of proof.11
This would be a clear instance of when the judge
would be alerted to take discretionary action under that
provision 975.02 of the statute.

So that, Justice Blackmun, is

a frequent case, and was the situation in the Torpy case,
actually, where the conviction was also contributing, that 1
am sure alerted the trial judge that this person should be
considered for examination.
I want to emphasise this.

The trial judge’s determin­

ation at that point is merely to have this examination and
then in the — as I pointed out in my brief, in the Note in

,

32
1954 Wisconsin Lav? Review, even though the statute had been
in operation only a couple os'! years, it was enacted in *51, —
Q

This statute was in ’5.1?

MR. FREDERICKS
Q

Yes,

951, sir,

Did you have something like it before 1951?

MR. FREDERICKS

We had a statute on the books, Your

Honor, from 1947, under which there was no commitment; it was
the civil, sexual, psychopath statute.
So the ~~
Q

And where is he sent for examination?

MR* FREDERICK: The examination, Your Honor, can be
conducted, at any one of several places.

It can be conducted

as an outpatient, while the mars is at large; he can he sent
to the se>: deviate center which, up until January the 1st, 1970,
was at: the State Prison at Waupun.

He may be examined at a

facility in Milwaukee County that's been approved by the State
Department of Health and Social Services, or he can also be
examined at other various and sundry hospitals that have met
the requirements of the State Department of —
Q

Now, then, if I understand you, the judge

decides he is going to find out.
MR. FREDERICK:
Q

Yes.

So he then orders

MR. FREDERICK; The examination,
Q

The first step is the examination?

33
MR* FREDERICK:
Q

Now

t

Yes.

after the examination has been completed ,

then what happens?
MR. FREDERICK:

That is the point®

The statistics

since the program has been in operation show about a 50/50
breakdown.

After the examination, about half the people are

determined to be not in need of treatment and not suffering
from the statutory phrase "aberrations", and are disposed of
under the Criminal Code regular sentencing provisions.
Q

That is, the judge then gets a report --

MR. FREDERICK? Right.
Q

— from wherever the institution is

,

and this

says this fellow doesn’t need treatment, and then the judge
sentences him.

In this case if that had happened, he'd have

got up to a year and that would have been the end of it, the
end of the case? is that it?
MR. FREDERICK:
G

That's true.

Got it.

But now the report is you happen to think this fellow
needs treatment? then what happens?
MR,, FREDERICK:

Then,at that point, Your Honor, there

is triggered a second round in v/hich the defendant has the
right to counsel again.

His own psychiatrist, not the State's

now, all paid for by the State, and they have a hearing to deter­
mine if in fact the recommendation of the Department should be

34
followed.

The burden is on the State to prove that by the

civil burden, preponderance of the evidence —
Q

Did it bring in the people who prepared the

report?
MR. FREDERICKS
Q

— from the institution?

MR. FREDERICKS
Q

Yes.

I see.

The judge takes their testimony.

And then they are subjected to cross-

examination.
MR. FREDERICK;
Q

That5s true.

And then the accused then has — he can put on

his own witnesses, is that it?
MR. FREDERICKS
Q
is what?

Ha can put on his own experts.

And then the final determination of the judge

A guess that he doesn't need treatment, or know he.

doesn't?

■'
MR. FREDERICK:
Q

Or know he doesn't.

.But that didn't happen in this case.

I'm reading

from page 11, it says that after he pleaded guilty he was
committed to the State Department of Public Welfare.

What

does that mean to you?
MR. FREDERICKs

Your Honor, what happened here was

he was using this form -- they have a standard form of the
order that he had been using up until that time.

Early in

January 1967 the Huebner case was decided, and that put in this

33
requirement for a hearing,

And, as I said, all I can do is

make the inference that three months after this decision came
down, the defendant either got a hearing or made a satisfactory
waiver of his right to the hearing, and I don't think -~
Q

You mean after this July thing?

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

Hot after it, Your Honor.

At

the time of this appearance for commitment, when the order —*
the first order —
0

But the®© two pages here doesn't show — I have

nothing here that even suggests that there was a hearing.
MR. FREDERICK:

Q

That's true,

Well, was there or was there not a hearing?

I®. FREDERICK:

Well, my — do you want me to tell
' )

you —
Q

The answer is no.

1
t

MR, FREDERICK:

~~ to go. outside: of the record a’hd

tell you?
Q

I mean — no.

Do you have anything on the

record that disputes this?
MR. FREDERICK:

No, 1 have nothing on the record that

disputes that,
Q

Well, it seems to me that if the State Department

had decided that he did not have mental aberrations, he would
serve cne year?
MR. FREDERICK:

That’s correct, Your Honor,

We can —

we can perceive that much., that the Department did recommend
treatment.

Q

And neither you nor I knows who In the Departman

made that decision.

It could have been an office clerk.

MR. FREDERICKS

No.

I can only tell you what the

procedure is in the usual case, but I couldn't swear that it
was followed in this case.

That's true, Your Honor.

Incidentally, this statutory word that may have
troubled you, "aberrations” was a word devised by the Departcien
to make this sort of distinction, Your Honor©.

T-fie Department

has, of course, been studying this program since it began
operation in '51, and they have gradually flushed out the
criteria.

So "aberrations" mean essentially this:

those who

have — whose sexual offense, in the broad sense, stems from
the — what should I say — their environment, for

example,

it's no secret that in. certain areas of Wisconsin incest
between father and daughter is not such a shocking thing,
strangely enough? those cases would be not within the purview
of the statute as the Department has interpreted their
criteria.
What they are trying tc do is to deal with the
individual whose own psychological makeup, as best that can
ba determined, and as imprecise as it is, leads him to commit
sex offenses,
Q

How, incidentally, I gather, as far as we know,

3?
that this chap never had any — the petitioner never had any
treatment of any kind, did he?
MR, FREDERICKS

There’s no record, Your Honor, to

show —
Q

&nd yet he was released on parol®.
«i

MR» FREDERICK*

Yes.

All I can do is to cits to you

the oases in my brief, Burbey vs. Burke, and there would bo -Q

I gather you have a parole board, do you?

MR. FREDERICK* They have a special review board under
this statute, Your Honor, who just

deals specially with

this class of persons.
Q

Wall, I wonder

we hove no idea of the

basis on which he was paroled, do we?

I. mean, how does that

special board determine that he's now cured of his aberrations,
whatever that is?
MR. FREDERICK:
Q

No, Your Honor.

The question is -•*

Even if hefs not cured, he’s still not a danger

to the public?
MR. FREDERICKs

Yes.

The criteria for release is

set out in Section 075.14, and it's ’’dangerous to the public
because of the person's mental or physical deficiency, disorder
or abnormality”, and that’s been construed, those last three
words relate back to the aberrations.
Q

Well, the finding must have — when he was

extended, the finding roust have been that he was dangerous.

38
MR. FREDERICK:
Q

Yes.

And notv, during the extended period, there is

now a finding that be’s no longer dangerous.
MR. FREDERICKS That’s true.
Q

New, on what is that predicated?

MR. FREDERICK:

1 would assume that is predicated,

Your Honor, on the results of the tests that are maintained
under the statute.

Everyone has to bo examined once a year,

and,if he isn’t examined, ho goes before the court again? when
he’s been extended once like this petitioner, he goes before
the court every six months, if he wishes„ for an extension.
So I would assume that this petitioner, like every­
body else similarly situated, was afforded the opportunity for
treatment, and the Department felt that the things had
progressed to the point that he was no longer dangerous*
Q

Tell me, Mr* Frederick, did the State resist a

hearing in the habeas corpus in the District Court?

It seems

to ms if we had had a hearing in this case, wa wouldn’t be
fishing in the dark the way we are.
MR. FREDERICK:

Well, that’s why X feel like I’m

operating here with one hand tied behind my back.
Q

Well, how do you think we feel?

MR. FREDERICK: We didn't resist it.
was this:

What happened

when the man, or this lady attorney didn’t file the

brief, the judge apprised the man —

39
Q

Ho, I‘ia speaking of — sho wasn1t representing

him in the Federal Court, was she?
MR. FREDERICK;
Q

No.

He filed a pro se petition for habeas corpus.

MR. FREDERICK; That's true.
Q

And the State resisted it.

MR. FREDERICKS
Q

And it wag dismissed.

MR. FREDERICK;
Q

We did.

That58 true.

So there’s never been a hearing.

MR. FREDERICK; There5s never been an evidentiary
hearing.
Q

And many of the things that we're discussing this

morning might have been flushed out, if there had been a hearing.
MR. FREDERICKs

Yes.

That's what I devoted the first

part of ray brief to, and of course I stand on those positions,
but I won’t burden you with them here now.
Q

Let mo see if 1 can clear up one thing.

Did I

understand you to say, in response to Justice Brennan's
questions, that there is an examination every six months under
the sex deviate statute?
MR. FREDERICK; After — after the period —
Q

After a five-year extension is started?

MR. FREDERICK;

No, no.

Ho, Your Honor.

It's — in

this case, when the hearing was held at the end of the maximum

time he would have received had he been sentenced under the
criminal coda, and he was continued for five years, then every
six months thereafter he has a right to have another hearing
before the court and the Department must justify hia continued
control by the Department.
Q

Now, you say thereafter, you mean during the

five-year period?
MR. FREDERICKS
point out this t

Yes, Justice Blackmun, but 1 should

You understand that every one under the —-

' who's handled under the Sex Crimes 3.aw has no minimum sentence,
so to speak.

In other words, if you go to the facility and

they decide a week later that you're done, you go out, either
on parole or final discharge.

So they can do either one.

And your connection with the Department is ended,
whereas, of course, everyone else who goes,

to State Prison

is sent there for a year, an$ must stay half the maximum
before they are eligible for parole; if you're sentenced for
30 years, you still come up for parole within a year, «at the
most, under Wisconsin law.
Incidentally, this maximum period is computed by
— much like they do in the federal? you take the statutory
good time and deduct it from the maximum sentence, so that on a
rap© charge of 30 years, you would do, at most, 16 years and
three months.

Q

Now —So that he'd have to wait for an examination for

41
that long under this statute, wouldn't he?

MR. FREDERICKi
0

Of course. Your Honor, «—

Except under special motion and special order of

the court.
MR. FREDERICKS

You have the same right, of course, as

everybody does, to petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and
I think that here it wouldn’t be just like the usual sentence
where your sentence hasn't expired yet, because if you could
show that you had not bean afforded treatment and so forth,
the State would be in dereliction of its duties under the
statute, and the writ would lie; just as

vary similar to

the provision in 18 0SC 451?.
If I could leave you with one thought. Your Honors,
and that’s this:

what we’ve tried to do here under this Sex

Crimes statute is to utilise psychiatric data, even though it
isn’t the bast, we can't believe that there could be much worse
than the existing system of incarceration, or you can put a man
in prison and lock him up and leave him there.

Here there is

an obligation on both parties, the State to provide treatment,
and the defendant to seek out treatment.
And 1 think this is important, because experience has
shown that these men are often poorly motivated for treatment,
and her© they have a definite incentive to be treated, and I
think, that it's about as good a system as any for dealing
with this sort of difficult problem, much as like faces us

42
with alcoholics and drug addicts and so forth, whore there Aa
no real question of insanity.

It’s at best a personality

dysfunction that has justified the commitment.
Tho other difficult part of this problem,. Your Honors,
is the jury trial question, and l say it!a difficult in the
sense that if we require a jury trial for these proceedings,
I wonder vzhere it is we draw the line after that, because there
are many statutes under which a man is deprived of his
liberty without jury trial.

For example, under Wisconsin

statutes, one who has tuberculosis, one who has venereal
disease, one who has typhoid fever, those who don't support
their families may be incarcerated summarily for up to six
month.
So I think it's a very real question as to what
point we're going to extend the right to jury trial in these
collateral proceedings.

Wisconsin has never required that under

the Constitution? it's always bean a statutory right to have a
jury ferial in sanity proceedings.
Thank you.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER; Thank you, Mr. Frederick.
Mr. Charne, you have one minute left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF IRVIN B. CHARNE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CHARNE?

Yes, Your Honor.

All right.

1 just wanted to respond briefly fee the question of

43
what triggered this proceeding.

Because my belief and

understanding' is that nothing may trigger it other than the
judge’s own intuition or prior knowledge of this person/ or
the fact that the community is presently angry about a certain
type of thing.

So the statuto doesn’t require any basis, and

I say the statute doesn’t require a hearing on the question of
whether the person is sexually motivated? and this record
doesn’t show any such hearing.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court, in the Buchanan case
that we cite, 1 say has laid down ~~
%

Q

Don't you think, Mr, Charne, it would be much

easier to decide these very difficult questions if we had
seme kind of record of what went on in this case?
MR. CHARGE;

Of course, Your Honor? yes,

There's

no question about that, and X — but it’s very difficult for
the District Court, Your Honors, 1 was a law clerk in the
t

Second District Court in Milwaukee, and 1 know how hard it is
to examine all these things and pick out the good ones, and
there was no lawyer who examined it, and the judge — the judge,
upon the issue that the petitioner himself set forth, the
judge thought this wasn't required in this case.
Q

I just wonder, before we try to grapple with it,

whether we shouldn't have the District Court conduct a hearing.
With or without a jury.
MR. CHARNE:

It would be vary much easier.

44
Q

You say this petitioner is on parole now?

MR. CHARGE;
Q

Yes, he is, Your Honor.

And if he goes back to a ecsraaifcment, will he

return to the old prison or will lie go to the mental health
MR. CHAHNEi

Mr. Justice, I don't really know the

answer to that, and I believe there11 a a good chance that he’d
go back to the prison.
Q

The — Wisconsin takes the other position.

And even ~-

Wall, I don’t know, then, Your Honor.

14R. CHARME:

They say that he would go to the

— wall, the State Central Hospital, Your Honor, which is a
it's an institution for the criminally insane; it is a penal
mental institution, it is not, you know, where people go under
civil

commitment.
Q

Well, was that in existence at the time he was

sentenced in SS7?
MR. CHARMSs
Q

Yes, it was.

But that is different from the institution to

which civilly committed people are sent?
MR. CHARMS:

Yes.

I think we pointed out in our

brief that a person who is civilly committed, there is no
provision for sending them to that institution, they go to a
hospital, for civil commitment.
q

Mr. Charne —»

45
Q

I suppose, technically, we have her© the wrong

respondent, then?
MR, CHARNEs

Well, I think that may be true, although

in the case of Jones vs» Cunningham, I think we cited, where
that was before you and the man was out cn parole? it was
pointed out -that the fact that he is out on parole would not
make the case moot.
And X think really here the respondent is the State of
Wisconsin.

The Attorney General is appearing for the State of

Wisconsin? the old prison system and the welfare is under on®
direction, so it is mostly a technicality.
It arises from the fact that he was paroled in March
of this year, and the writ was granted in March, also.

Well, yes, but the petition had been filed here

before —

Oh, yes, the petition had been filed —
