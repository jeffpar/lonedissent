ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD So SHAPIRO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT, UNITES STATES OF .AMERICA
MR. SHAPIROi

Mr, Chief Justice, sc.1 may 1C el ”;cc

the Courts
This is an appeal by the United States fr-rrni' a
decision of the District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois in a Civil Anti-Trust Case*

The Appellee, the

Defendant in the District Court, is Topco Associatos, Inc.
"Tope©15 is a cooperative corporation which procures grocery
and related nonfood products for 23 supermarket chains and
2 wholesalers.

These chains and wholesalers are owner*»

members of the corporation and they

• >ntroX it*

The restriction challenged by the govern$.-3&& if-; an.
agreement among the member chains, through Topco, that they
will not retail Topco«-‘branded products outside of Specified
territories, and that they will not sell Topco-supplied
products at wholesale.
The government contended in the District Court
that the arrangement was a horizontal territorial allocation
scheme which was illegal par se under Section 1 of the
Sherman Act.

4
? iv,

rits, the District Court

held that the Act had not boon violated, and, cntored. judgment
for the Defendant.

In its opinion, which is page

343 of

the Record, and its findings of fact, which are page 533,
it concluded that the division of territories amcsnc; Tope©
supermarket chains, and the accompanying wholesale restric­
tions, were not illegal per se»

Rather, the Court ruled,

they were reasonable restrictions ancillary to the cooperafiv
private label program Topco furnishes its owner^raembers •

The Topco organisation, as X said, procures food
and related nonfood grocery items*

About 55 parcant of thor.a

owned by Topco*

These brand names are not nationally

They are such names as Food Civ . whid

They include primarily strategic grocery items:

MR* SHAPIRO:

Ho? Your Honor, they era not*

Their membership does not restrict their

activities neces sarily?
MR. SHAPIRO:

No* Your Honor, it doc:? not.

The Topco member chains are, as I said, independent
organisations, and their combined retail sales in 1957 were
$2.3 billion, so that the 35 Topco organisations are fourth
in retail sales, after .Ml3, Safeway and Kroger*

K'any of the

chains are very substantial in their local market*

Giant

Foods, for example, was a member of Topco from .1950 to 1366,
aiid it had 23 percent of the District of Columbia market.
Q

What percentage of that gross is represented

by Topco brand names?

Q

hoes Topco supply any goods that aren’t under

private label'?

MR, SHAPIRO:
Q

Yes, it does, Your Honor»

So it does mass purchasing of rational labels'?

MR» SHAPIRO;

Ho, not of national~labeled products•

It may buy a few, but there are a great many nonbrandet!
goods*

It does purchase some branded goods which are n t

Topco brands.

As X say, the division seems to break down to

about $102»5 million of non~Topco*branded producto»
Q

And what is it that a Topco affiliate is

given, an exclusive license, or whatever it is, to sell tin
Topco brands in its area, is that it?
HE. SHAPIRO;
Q

That is correct*

And is that the crtas of the government’s

case?
MR, SHAPIRO;

That is the crux of the government’s

case,

she Sopco organisation licenses each memberr and -the

terms of the license say, ?,You may not sell tl ■ :
goadss you are authorised to r.sll outside of specified.

territories.“
Actually, there are three Kinds of license*

ne in-

exclusive, the other is nonexclusive, and the third is
called "coextensive,** but, in effect, as the District Court
found, they add up to exclusive in fact.
Q

And what’s the remedy that the government

wants?
MR. SHAPIRO:

The remedy wishes to enjcin

the

territorialis aticn and the wholesale restrictions that are
in effect.

Q

It would be limited -than, what, to the Topeo

brand, is it, items?
MR, SHAPIRO:

Ugh —

I.'QR. SHAPIRO:

Yesr Your Honor, the injunction would

require this territorialination.

Then the wholesale restrictions follow.

That is

what we are attacking»
Q

What if the particular member who hr..a a small

chain wants to expand his territory?

Does he have any

problem until ho runs into the territory of.another?
MRo SHAPIRO;

Well, in order to expand his terri­

tory, he has to get the consent of the Toaco organisation,
which, of course/ consists of his fellow chains*

If he runs

into the territory of another, he is subject to a veto, in
effect»
Q

If it’s open territory, I suppose Topco wants

to sell all the merchandise it can, sc if it is open, he
can move into it*

arrangement like this.

That is why you have•an exclusive
And it was the Gcvcrnmsnt^s position

in the District Court, and it’s the government's position,
here that this kind of an arrangement, effected through thift
kind of an organisation, is a horizontal agreement to
allocate territory and to restrict wholesale operations,
which is illegal per se, and hub

keen

illegal par ee over

10
since the Addyston Pipe Case/ '

ears ago*

If this were a vertical restriction, orguably.Li
might, be a different case, although, even there, I. thirl,
the law is now clear that a vertical restriction on products
which are sold to a bu • ■

ss for resale, and

cannot be imposed even vertically, and when you have it
horizontal, as yon do in this case, as an agroera-rv.vh

nong

actual and potential competitors, it has to fca illegal r-er sc.
She District Court relied particularly in its
decision on the 6th Circuit*s ruling in Federal Trade
Commission against Sanclura Ccsapany in 339 F«2d S47, yet that
was a vertical case, and in that case, the 6th Circuit
pointed out that 'if the arrangement before it hat been a
horizontal arrangement, as this is, then it would, lave b.-en
illegal per ee,
Now, I call this horizontal because this organiza­
tion is almost identical in its operation to the operation
in the United «States v* So.ally *

When you put the S&aly ce.se

together with the ruling in United States v. Schwivya ecsrpanv,
which also involved a territorial restriction, you come up
with the plain rule that it is illegal per so, a;ad we thin!?,
the District Court should have stopped right there*
It didn't.

It went, on to say that this kind of

terri totalization was reasonable, even though it*;s among
actual and potential compatitor®, because, without

11
competition from each other,

anil thus would better be able to compete with the vertically
integrated chains, such as M-P, Kroger end Safeway,
argument was that these organisations, M-?, Safeway , anl

Kroger, are able,- through vertical integration,
exclusive private brands?’'that is, private brands that

don*t sell to anybody else.
So what the Topco crganizatic

by the District Court wo a to agree among theaeelva; • not to
compete so that they could have exclu ive private brands* a
the only way that they could achieve that exclusivity, however, was by horizontal agreement among '.themselves.

Shat :La

the justification which is said to take this case c-at .fide the
per oe rule.
Our objection is not to exclusivity as such, with
respect to a brand, nor is it to the combination of chains;
into a single buying organization to achieve useful economies
of scale.

What we object to is the attempt to achieve

exclusivity by an agreement not to compete

among direct

end actual and potential competitors.
Now, when the District Court sought to justify thi:s
arrangement, it said that the government had conceded that
the Topco arrangement enabled Topco members to compete
better,

We did not make such concession.

12
brief, we said:

that these unlawful agreements are intended to enable the

conduct®

""‘t *
Instead, what we urged in the District Court •••-ran

that the'law just does not allow direct agreements among
competitors as a means of counterbalancing the power or
advantages of somebody els© in the marketplace®

This

argument was made in the Schwinn Case, where it was saidi

in trademarked bicycles can

merchandisers.

Wall now, how does this work out?

have to have a co-extensive or nonexclusive license to
compete in the same area, and it is unlikely that you would
have that kind of arrangement, because the Topco members
have been quite insistent that they not have competition
from somebody else in the sale of Topco merchandise.

13
Q

$xe we concerned then only with the exclusive

license?
MR. SHAPIRO:

No, Your Honor, 2 think we have to be

concerned with the nonexclusive and the co~extensive lie-tree
also, because all of then involve some kind of arrangement
in which the members of the organisation, as competitorsr
get together and say, "Well, we'll either lot this guy in,
or we won't let him in*"

language, but it really amounts to that»
What they say is, "Is this area adequately
covered to promote the sale of Teuco brands?"

say it is, then they agree to give an exclusive*

Their object is to

That is the whole purpose of this

Not only is it attracti a i, i'c'
In fact, Dr* Barnes, i' " expert vt

the Defendants put on, said that the

members would incur

costs many times the cost of *Sopco if they didn’t have it.

is quite possible that they could still .achieve some of '
benefits of Individual .labeling, for example, by using it-:,

with Your Honor’s question for a moment, Hope© itself sails

ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR S. GRXMM, ESQ.,
Ill BEHALF OF APPELLEE, TOPCO ASSOCIATES, IKC.

MRo GRXMM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and nay it. pltsu -a

the Courts
This Court recognised, in the White Motor

case

that caution must be exercised when a par &<a concept is
extended to essbrace new practices.

The relevant in uiry in

such a circumstance is not whether an existing concept can
be road broadly enough to cover a new practice, but rather,
whether the rationale, and the policy behind the rule really
fits the new practice.
Per se rules, after all, are based upon judicial
experience.

What experience, then, have the courts had with

the practices such, as those here presented?

X would point

out that in the district court, the government conceded that
it could find no case which would justify a motion for some
rejudgment.

In its jurisdictional statement to this Court,

the government pointed, out that the Court .had nsv-::-: b-:io.n
presented with a similar case*
Under such circumstances, we submit -that it was
proper and appropriate for the district court to eng&g... r
it did# ia an inquiry into the “economic and businaso stuff,
to ass the words of fcha White Motor • decision, fro?.? vein:
these competitive.practices emerged.
Judge Will, having done that, found that their
ultimate effect was not to detract from competition# hut to
enhance it.
What, then, is the competitive context which
district court found 'in this industry, and frees, which
practices emerged?

those

There does 'not appear to- be any cli spute

concerning the purpose for which Topco was formed, or for
which it continues to exist,

The cooperative was formed in

the mid-1940*s by a group of local grocery chains who
recognised that the only way to successfully compete in this
industry, indeed, perhaps the only way to survive in the
industry# was to duplicate in some measure the advantages of
scale which fcha giant mass merchandisers had attained.
We have set forth in some detail these advantages
in our brief,

They are impressive and, to some in fcha

industry, were overwhelming.

But Judge Will found that

perhaps the most competitively significant advantage which
the large regional and national chains had achieved was the

private label.

Private label permitted these chains to

reduce their costs, to lower their prices, and yet to
increase their profits and, ;...t the same time, to inslil'
Consumer loyalty for their stores.
The national chains adopted groups of trademark??
by which to identify their private labels.

These tv'.?:,. otter,

the store names themselves, or contractions thereat',
trademarks and the products bearing them were
these large chain stores.

;b-r: h:

The chain, rather than a manu­

facturer, was identified as the source of those presets if.
the mind of the consumer.

The consumer soon recognised ikr.t

if her family had a preference for "Ann Page" green beaus, or
"Eight O’clock” coffee, she was required to patronise as?
stores in order to obtain these items,
Most of the advantages of the giant national chains
were beyond the ability of smaller operators to obtain.

One

which was not, however, was the private label which, through
cooperative efforts, they were able to achieve*

These

cooperative efforts then gave them one competitive tool :hioh
the large chains had.

Many of the other advantages of the

larger chains were still beyond their economic reach.
The Topco Cooperative adopted a family of brands
which each of its members could use and identify, ir Lis
own marketing area, as his own private label.

Each continued,

however, to operate under his own store names

S ach a on t i mi e &

>0

adopt his own merchandising philOSophy, bis eta pricing.
Each continued, in short, to remain independent0

But fer

the first time in their history, these independent ihaias
had the means of meeting the significant price competition •
which only the giant chains had theretofore offered tho
consumer.
She trademarks, however, adopted by these coopera­
tives, had no immediate recognition in the marketplace, an
often did those of "the r

chains•

It was

each operator to introduce those trademarks into his own
marketing area,

This required m investment in time, in

money, in effort, in resources.

Such•an investment res

designed to identify his stores with these producta in the
mind of the consumer, just as the large national chains had
dona, to build a secondary meaning for them.

If, however,

the trademarks, which were used as private labels, were
subject to use by another operator in the trading area of a
member, their value as private brands would be destroyed,
Q
bit?

Now, would you develop that for us a little

I assume you are, but if not, I would like to have you

dwell on that, for me, at least.
MR. GRIMM:

Why would it be destroyed?

The national chains, as 1 have outlined,

had developed these private brands, and they had built them
as competitive tools,

Through them, they had instilled a

consumer loyalty for their stores.

23
Q

Could you put that in terms of *.n illustration

of what cam MF do with their vertical situation that is
analagous to this?
MR. GRIMM:

ME had developed their own line of

private labels which the consumer recognised wore available
only in AfiP stores#

**&nn Page* was one of their principal

products,» for example.
Q

And MP, I take it, controls the competitive

situation as between stores by their power to locate their
supermarket wherever they want to?
MR. GRIMM:

That’s correct, but the consumer knows

that if she wants to buy **hnn Page” green beans, for ©sample,
she is required to go to an ASF store in order to obtain
them,

it engendered a uniqueness for the stores

one of:

the. .basic means of competition in this industry is to develop
a uniqueness for the store eo the consumer desires to shop
in one store as opposed to another.

There are many ways of

doing this, but the most competitively significant way, as
far as the consumer is concerned, perhaps, is through a
medium which offers her a good value at a. low price, and one
which she can only get at that store, and that is what &aP
and the larger chains use private labels for.

Its purpose was not to preclude competition among

existence of trademarks provides any insulation from Sherman

Q

That’s right»

MR. GRIMM:

But what we do contend is that trade­

That, in affect, it makes cooperative

Well, the illustration 1 gave you would prruir

If we could have a private label, then the private

7**11 label would be competing with the private Giant label.
MR, GRIMM:
Q

That’s correct, and this is precisely

And tinder this arrangement, that doesn’t happen

because only Giant or only 7« 11 is allowed the Tc-pco private
label.

Isn’t that right?
MR. GRIMM;

Except that through the cooperative, it

would not be possible for them to obtain second lines of
labels so that each could have his own label.

The econo: y

of combined purchasing would largely ba lost by attempting
to do that.
Q

Let us assume for the moment that it was just

as cheap for each person to have his own private? label as
to have just the one brand among all of then.

Then the

effect of exclusivity in this arrangement is simply to limit
competition, and private label does.

It reaches a number of

private labels in any one market.
MB. GRIMMs

Q

Other operators in that area-

to compared with the situation where each

chain has its own private label, and is free to move into any
market it wants, v?ith its own private label, as compared
with that, the present system under Topco does limit the
quantity of competition in private label merchandise.
MR. GRIMM:

If we're taking only the Topco

Cooperative as a source of private brands, that would be
true.

There are other sources of cooperative —

So it Wouldn’t be any more expensive for a

MR» GRIMM:

Well, it’s more than start-up costs.

Ifcfs having a staff of personnel out in the procuring areas.
It is the developing a second line of labels themselves, ttv

There are a large group of factors required in this type of

The Topco member is constantly in a state of chang ■■■«.

M the larger members of Topco grow and become large enough
to, in fact, develop their own private label programs, which

of $250 million annually, they graduate from the Topco

The government has stated in its brief that it file
not specifically attempt to prove any adverse effect on
competition, and yet contends that such an adverse effect
ought to be inferred.

This inference is based largely v\mv.

Idle economic theory which we contend does net find support
in the record, and which Judge Will rejected.

Judge Will

found that Topco licensing has no appreciable effect on
Topco member expansion, and does not control cr affect pricer;.
Q

Further on that theory, does the government

concede that it did not adversely effect prices'?

Or is that

just about —
ME. GRIMM*

No, Mr. Justice — Mr. Chief Justice,

the government conceded that it did not specifically attempt
to prove an adverse effect on competition, but they alleged
that certain inferences ought to foe drawn from the record
in terms of effect on expansion and prices, where these
inferences were rejected by Judge Will»
Topco members naturally are interested in expansion

end growth.

Judge Will has

Topao licensing has no appreciable influence on aether
expansion, and the government has been able to cite no
instance to the contrary.

Expansion ©sisto as fellows

let me try to outline it briefly;
When a member desires to expand into a new area,
he gets a license.

License is granted as a matter of course,

because the Topco Cooperative in interested in having ita
members expand.

Even in licensed areas,, an expanding r.c.-.ber

»sy be licensed to sell Tope a branded products.

It is only

in those cases where a primary marketing arcs., the heartland
of another’s operation exists, that a member may not be
licensed to sell Topco brands.

But even in those cases,

the record demonstrates that the operator will use alternative
sources of private label in the industry, such an from
another cooperativo, or from a wholesale organisation*

But

that situation would not often occur because of the geographic
dispersion of Topco members in various parts of the country.
Despite the district -court ’a finding a that the
Topco licensing provisions resulted In no unreasonable
restraint, the government now urges that these findings ought
now to be ignored, because the government urges the
irrebuttable presumption i 3 an unreasonable restraint, regard*
lees of its actual effect.

Q

Yes, X think what

««* by benefit to the public?

HR* GRIMM?

«— what ho was saying was that the

ultimate effect — that’s correct, Me. Chief Justice — was
a benefit to the public.
Let us look at a mouont, at the concept of the
horizontal restraints concept which the government would

seek to have applied here.

Shis pep oe concept concerning

horizontal market divisions finds Its origin end application
in those cases where competitors, typically those with
sufficient market power to restrict output — if they chose have combined and conspired to eliminate all competition
among themselves*

Such naked restraints have no capacity to

achieve any beneficial effect on competition*
However* when courts have been presented with
restrictions which are necessary and reasonably related to
achieving a legitimate venture, courts have refused to apply
this per so analysis, and properly so, we submit, for such
arrangements have a. capacity to intensify competition, • and
therefore, their ultimate effect on competition must be
discerned.

And Judge Will did discern that effect hero, and

four** It was beneficial.
The refusal to apply per s© rule her© would not,
wo submit, result in interminable economic inquiries.

The

doctrine of ancillary restraints provides a well-defined legal
concept by which to identify those practices which have a
capacity to increase efficiency, to ultimately enhance
competition and to benefit the consumer.

This distinction

was highlighted, we submit, in the Seal;./ case.

Scaly

presented a combination of manufacturers who agreed to
refrain from selling trademarked items outside of licensed
areas.

Despite the government's urging in that case, the

37

court did not find that those provisions were per os a
violation of the Shonaan Aet*

Instead, the court examined

the context and round, an aggregation of trado restraints,
including unlawful price fixing and policing, the ultimate
purpose end effect of «hieh was anticompetitive.

But the

i

court; specifically distinguished -those quito different
situations such as* restrictions incident to cooperative
efforts among small grocers*
In Sopoo, grocers have entered into cooperative
efforts, not for the purpose of ©llsiinatiag ooi^otltion
among thesoeelvee, not for the purpose of restricting channel;:,
of distribution, but for the purpose of creating acu bra-., s,
more important, competitively significant private labels, and
in so doing, they have created now competition in the industry
which did not exist before, said which cm continue to ©slot
only because of the licensing provisions.
We do not contend because Topco members are email,
medium-size chains, because their purpose is to assist their
members to better compete in the industry, that the Sherman
Act doeaa51 apply.

What we do contend is that tho ultimate

offset of these practices is to enhance competition, and
Judge Will so found.
fho government here socles to claim competition in.
private labels, but that is a contradiction in terms, because
competition la labels means they ’would no longer b© private,
