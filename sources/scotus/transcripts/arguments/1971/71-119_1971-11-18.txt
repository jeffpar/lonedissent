MR® CHIBB’ JUSTICE BURGER:

We5IX hear arguments next

in Ko, 1X9 r Trbovich against United Mine Workers.
Mr- Rauh.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH L. RAUH, JR., ESQ,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONS: i
MR. RAUH;

Mr. Chief Justice, and max* it please the

Courts
The courts below held that petitioner, the head of
the

reform group within the United Mine Workers, could not

intervene in the Secretary of Labor’s suit to upset the
1969 union election, in which petitioner and his reform group
had an intense interest.
The question here on certiorari is whether the
courts below erred in holding that the Labor-Management
Reporting and Disclosure Act carves an exception out of Rule
24(a) and thus bars the intervention of petitioner's reform
group„
On May 29, 1969, Mr. Joseph Yablonski announced that
he would run for president of the United Mine Workers of
America.

Between May 29th and December 9th of 1969, the date

of the election, Yablonski was forced to bring five lawsuits.
In tires of these we got our preliminary injunction, giving us
the right to nail out literature, getting Yablonski his job
/

back after he was fired in a reprisal firing, and stopping the

4
Journal, the United Min© Workers Journal, from being need as
campaign literature.
In one of the five suits we didn't get an order, but
before that the Mine Workers had done in court .shat wa asked
for, namely, to tail what the rules of the election would he?
and the fifth suit, which is our suit to make

>2r, Boyle and

the others pay back what they have taken from the union, is
still pending.
Mow, in addition to these lawsuits, Mr. YabXonski
also sat in an investigation by the Secretary of Labor, of
the massive violations going on during the elections. But
despite the

cruel language of Section 801 of LMRDA, and

despite this Court6s statement in footnote 5 in the laborers
case that Section 601 applied here and he could Investigate,
and despite the fact that we detailed the violations of lav?,
the Secretary of Labor refused to make any investigation.
So, there came December 9th, and the incumbents
declared themselves elected.
Two points might be mentioned on this election.
First, where we had poll watchers, we either broke even or won.
Where we didn’t, we lost by margins up to 50 to 1.
Second, as was found by the Subcommittee on Labor,
the decision was made by pensioners, because they voted,
largely voted for them, 93 percent voted for Mr. Boyle.
On December 18th, nine days after the election,

Mr« Yablonski challenged the election, detailing to the Labor
Department these massive violations.
On January 5th, Mr. Yablonski was found dead.
On January 20th, the petitioner adopted the challenge He had been Mr, YablonskiSs campaign manager,, and he took over
the challenge to the election.
On March 5th , 'die Secretary of Labor brought suitbased on petitioner*s challenge.
On April 1st, 1970, Miners for Democracy, the
Yablonski reform group, was formed.
On October 2nd, when no progress had bean made in
the suit, an answer hadn't even been filed, we moved to
intervene.
We sought three things then and now, as our
intervention.

That is, we seek to do three things by

intervening.
First, to assure that the violations asserted by
tlie Secretary of Labor are speedily and vigorously presented
to the court.
Second, to raise two additional grounds for upsetting
the election; namely, that Mr, Boyle, by his illegal pension
increase, had engaged in improper interference with the
election; and second, that voting through illegal locals
had made it easy for them to steal the election. And I
refer to the pension vote, because the illegal locals are

6

pension locals,
Third, to obtain a District Court decree insuring
that the new election would not be a repeat of the last one»
In other words, we seek to do three things?

to assist and push

the Secretary of Labor, to prove what he has sat out. to prove,
to add two issues, and to see that there's a decree so there
wq:;i

81

be a repeat*
The District Court said no to our intervention*

He

said, at page 112 of the Appendix, that the Landruai-Griffin
Act deprived the court of jurisdiction to permit our inter­
vention.
The Court of Appeals affirmed without opinion.
The case is here on an expedited schedule, because
■die case is in trial below.

This is the status below?

On September 13th of this year, the trial started.
After about five weeks of trial it went into recess.

It

reconvenes this coining Monday, November 22nd, for the
completion of the government's case,
If we are permitted to intervene, we fill not make
any delays, we are not going to ask for discovery — in fact,
1 hereby waive discovery, so that we can go right into the
case as it is? and we will go on with our case promptly.
So that, in ether words, there is no question of delay through
our intervention.
Q

This isn't a jury trial, is it?

7
MR. RMJH:
Q
add two

Mo, sir? it's in front of uudge Bryant.

Excuse me, Mr. Rauh, you did say you wanted to

more —?

MR. RAUHs
Q

Two issues, sir.

— issues.

Well, doesn't Hodgson rather

foreclose that?
MR. RMJH5

St’s different from Hodgson.
«U- cw^i «uetOJVmCK JOO.3-»

You said

that they couldn’t add in Hodgson
Q

I didn't say it.

MR. RAUH:

Q

I know you didn't.

The Court said —

Yes.

MR. RAUHi

— they couldn't add .in Hodgson because

it hadn't bean in the petitioner's — in the complaint.
Q

In the charge, yes.

MR. RAUH:
0

In the charge.

Here, it's in the charge.

Oh, I see,

MR. RAUH?

And the question is whether it can go to

him now that he went ahead, so that that problem is up? but it
is a different question than Hodgson, and we believe —
Q

But — it's different, but it does raise the

question of whether -the Secretary is wholly in control of the
issue?
MR. RMJH:

That’s correct, Your Honor.

And there­

fore —
Q

Your other two grounds for intervention may be —

might be right? this one could be
MR. RADH:
Q

Precisely.

We believe —

Could belong.

MR. RAUH:

That's precisely correct? Your Honor.

We believe that we are entitled to raise those two issues#
and that there's — because he's found probable cause# -therefore;
once we get. in# we ought to raise it.

We ought to be allowed

to raise it.
Secondly, we feel that should be left to the District
Court, who has control of how broad -the intervention is going.
Third , we say that if "you should knock us out on those
two, that doesn't say why we shouldn't be in the case,

.

And therefore, I make it in that order.
New# first, we meet the requirements of Rule 24 (a).
St fits us like a. glove.

Indeed, in the lower court, in the

Court of Appeals the government conceded this.

In the lower

the Court of Appeals, Judge Wright asked Mr. Bahtocchi,
who was arguing for the government, whether we didn't meet
Rule 24(a) and whether his whole argument wasn't that the
IiMRDA excluded us, and he said yes.
Q

Mr. Rauh, is that conceded by yo-.ii' opposition?

MR, RMJHs

Well, at this moment, I cannot say.

In

their opposition to cert they said that the Secretary hadn't?
then we pointed out -that it bad been done in open court.
in their brief they don't mention it# so 2 suppose it's

And

9
conceded that this happened.

We heard it with our own ears I

However ■»»>
Q

Was there a transcript of it?

MR. RAUHs

Oh, they have a record,, sir, but we

don’t have access to that, to the Court of Appeals record.
I think it*s like the record that you all make.
But 2 don’t think they will challenge, sir, that Mr.
Battocchi said, conceded.? but they can withdraw the concession.
1 mean, I’m not arguing that they can’t — I’m not arguing
that you can’t withdraw a. concession sometime during a case.
2 didn't look up the law on concessions, because I’m really
not relying on it.
What I’m relying upon is the fact that it’s so clear
that we are in, that we meet Rule 24
Q

that they even

—

And that’s intervention of right?

HR. SAUHs
Q

{&.),

That’s intervention of right.

/

Right.

MR. RAUH:

And ~

Q

You mean under subdivision (2)?

Q

That’s right.

MR. RAUHs

Yes, precisely, Your Honor*

And., for example, our interest is obvious*

Our

whole life depends on the outcome of this election.
The only question that the government raises, why
we don’t meet Rule 24(a), now that the. concession has been

withdrawn ,

is that they adequately represent us ? but they

basa that on the fact that they say there are no private rights.
But Your Honors have made clear* in both Laborers
and the Glass Bottle Blotters case* that there are both? that
there are private rights and public rights.
Indeed# strangely enough# the government# at page 33
of their brief cites this proposition that there -are no private
rights a case that refers to private rights.
At the bottom of page 33# the government says %
°Xn the words of this Court* the Act was not designed * merely
to protect the right of a union member to run for a
particular office in a particular election'* they asserted a
vital public interest" — well# of course# Xsd be the last
person to say there isn't a great public interest here.
But there is such an obvious private right# it's exactly like
the. parallel case of Scofield# where this Court unanimously
referred to the interblending of public and private rights.
The same interhlendir.g of public and private rights
that, you have at the Labor Board# you have hera» ,
Kow# if there are an interblending of public and.
private rights# which# it seems to me# are obvious# then we're
the only one to protect the private rights.

The Secretary

doesn’t even claim to protect the private right? he says there
area51 any*
So I'm not

there is a tremendous hostility between

the liabor Department and our side.

We do not, however, have

to rely on that,
I’m not relying on that to show we*re not adequately
represented»

1 rely on the very simple proposition that the

Landrma-Griffin Act, as this Court held, set out both public
and private rights, and that no one can -*» and, that we are
properly to protect the private rights.
Mow, as Hr. Justice White said, you may not ha able
to get everything in there that you want to protect those
private rights, that may — we argue the other side.

We’re

still the parson to protect the private rights Insofar as the
District Court, in supervising, would permit.
Q

Well, 1 take it, even if the two issues you want

added couldn’t be added, if -the Secretary ran a new election,
he would still have to run a legal election.
MR. RSJDHs
Q

Well, 1 would hope so.

And if the situation you claim existed in the

prior election, actually existed, it's not supposed to exist
in the new one if it was illegal.
MR. RADII:

Yes, Your Honor, and that therefore the

remedy and the issues do come together.
Q

Yes.

MR. RMJH:

That’s quite correct, sir, that in the

remedy point that we want to be in on, you do get, you will
get the problem on the issues themselves —

Q

Even .if they can'' 1: be litigated?

MR, RAXJHs

Yes* sir.

Precisely,

Now, assuming there are private rights as to which
we have a right to protect them under 24(a) and that we need
24(a), then the question comes downs
carve out and exception to 24(a)?

Does Landrum-Griffin

Does it say you can't get

in?
How* the government's brief demonstrates beyond
peradventure of doubt what no one challenges?

namely* wo

can't start the suit.
Of course we can't start the suit.

Section 403 of

Landrum~Grif£ln says that it's the exclusive right of the
Secretary.
But proving that we can’t start the suit hc>. nothing
to do with proving that we haven’t a right of intervention,
itod what the government's brief does not direct itself to is
the difference between intervention and starting the suit.
They don't mention the brilliant articles by Professor Shapiro
outlining all the many differences between intervention and
starting a suit.

They don't mention that.

They don't mention this Court’s decision in. Phelps v,
Oaks * which goes far beyond anything via suggest.

In that case

this Court said that in a diversity casta aii intervention by a
non-diversity person didn’t cause a loss of jurisdiction.
The government doesn't mention that.

The government doesn't mention anything about the
policy of strong enforcement, and having us in there will help
strong enforcementr not weaken it.
Look at what we would do in our attack.
First, we will urge speed.
for speed.

The government suggests we might want to slow it

down or something.
here.

We have every motivation

We are under a despicable dictatorship

The thing we want most is a speedy decision.
We know the union.

on that.

We can be helpful in the court

We know the violations, because we were there when

the violations were occurring that they wouldn't investigate.
We think it would improve the situation to bring up the issues
of pensions and bogus locals, and wrap the whole thing up as
in Scofield.
We can help with the remedies.

My goodness, we're

going to bo in the case.
In other words, we will be the ones who can help
with this.
Now, Congress couldn't have thought that they wanted
a one-sided tiling here.
in that courtroom.

You have to remember that Boyle is

The other side. — there are two factions%

there's the Yafolonski faction and the Boyle faction.
is there.

Boyle

The general counsel of the union was the representa~

tive there.
But now they have new counsel, which has happened

because one man died, who was representing them.

So they

have new counsel.
The new counsel have already been disqualified in
another case because they were too close to Boyle.

And I

would like to call Your Honors9 attention — wa didn’t have
time for a reply brief because of the expedited schedule.
But may 1 call Your Honors9 attention to 77LRRM 2921, where
the new counsel were disqualified from the other case c:n
conflict of interest because they’re too close to Boyle.
They’re going to he there.

And if we’re not there, you get a,

wholly one-sided operation.

Exactly what was referred to in

Cascade about the danger of the court or the department
knuckling under.
It will be a one-sided struggle in that courtroom
with the Yablonski forces totally removed.

Since 24{a)

covers us, and since — since 24(a) covers us like a blanket,
which was conceded at one time, and sines there is nothing in
the statute that indicates that you should carve out this
exception, we respectfully submit that it should not be,
Q

Let me put a question to you, so you can be

thinking about it while you're having lunch, Mr, Rauh,
•I’d lifts to have you suggest to us this afternoon
why it is that you can't do most of these things without
intervention.

I’m sure yon will want to cover ±.at«

That you won't be able to accomplish most, if not all,

of the objectives that you.5 re seeking without actually having
intervention allowed,

If you’d address yourself to that

after lunch.
MS» RAUH:

Q

Yes, Your Honor.

Thank you.

(Whereupon, at 12s00 noon? the Court was recessed?
to reconvene at Is00 p.m. ? -the same day.)

16
&raH3500H SESSION
Cl;:00 p.m«)
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEHs
MR. RMJBs

Hr. Ram, you my continue.

Mr, Chief Justice, in answer to the question

placed to ma before luncheon, 1 would answer it this ways
I assume that the question does not go to the first
reason for intervention, namely, to support, tha Labor
Department in this suit by vigorous action? nor &oe.& it go
to the last of the three points, namely, on the remedy.

It

goes to the second point of our adding issues, and why can't
we litigate that somewhere else?
My answer to that is that while there may be
jurisdiction to support the issue in other places, it cannot
be in an election contest because of Section 403.
For example, take the case of Boyle v. Blankenship,
where the issue of Mr* Boyle's misconduct in the election
raised has been adjudicated, he's been removed as trustee of
the Welfare Fund because of his manipulations with the
election «— with the pension fund during -the election.
But it doesn’t bring it into an election context.
So, my answer, sir, is that, first, it doesn’t
apply to our first and third reasons? secondly, on the
additional issues, wa cannot raise them in a context where
they can. be utilised in the election suit and, if I may add
this point, Scofield was predicated on the assumption that you.

17
would get all matters in one place that ware appropriate to
it,

In fact? the basis of 3gofield was that there not ba

piecemeal litigation? and X suggest the same thing would be
useful here.

Now,

If 1 may interrupt there? prior to -this

particular federal statute? if you had wanted to attack an
alleged — a union election? would you have had a State law
action for it?
MR, R&UHs
Q

X believe so. yes? sir.

Under the Constitution? for a violation under it?

MR. R&UH:

Yes? X believe? for many of these things?

not all? but some.
Q

And you still have that?

MR. R&UH:

No? sir? I don't believe ws have that

any more? sir.

MR. RAUH;
of that, sir.

. Oh? I*m absolutely ~~ I’m quite confident

If you look at this sentence, it says in 403?

“The remedy provided . by this Title for challenging an election
already conducted shall be exclusive."

Q

Where were you reading from?

MR, RAUH:
of Section 403,

X was reading from the last sentence

In my brief it's on page 7, Your Honor.

“The remedy provided by this title for challenging
an election already conducted shall be exclusive."
1 do not —
Q

fiat’s the remedy?

MR, RAUH:
Secretary of Labor,
Q

Well, the remedy is the suit by the
That’s 'the only remedy there is.

I know, but he's brought suit.

I'm just

wondering if there is any State law action which survives
which could be pendent in this action.
MR. RMJHs

X do not believe so, Your Honor.

Now, coming *—
Q

Let me pursue that just for a moment, Mr. Rauh,

That would include, you mean, a suit to trace trust funds
out of the union treasury or the pension fund, no State
remedy survives the federal statute?
MR. RAUH:

Oh, on tracing the funds, they’re using

the funds •-*- if they're using the funds illegally, under
Section SOI we can bring suit.

We have a suit

on many

of their

illegalities,
Q

But not a State action?

MR. RAUH:

No.

That's a LMRDA action.

not in a context of the electiori.

But it's

In other words, what you

19
can't do is to bring a suit to try to affect the election
after it’s over.

That, has to be dona in here.

And we have

to corae in here.
Now, whether we can raise additional issues is the
question that Mr. Justice White put to me# and 2 believe is
also# in essence# the question that you put to me.
can.

X say we

And X further say if there is any question about it# it

should be left to the discretion of the District Court.
And X finally say that even if we can't# and you
won't leave it to the District Court# it is only one of the
three reasons why we sry we should intervene.
Q

Mr. Ravi# IV pussisled why you should suggest

the last sentence in

103 necessarily bars a State action#

on the grounds that It will not be heard in this suit.
Certainly if these were grounds which had not been
Included in the oric.bial complaint# that is# the entire union#

Secretary now

under i'odgson# may not touch in the lawsuit#

that they would not bs the basis of a State action?

¥:l» RAUH:

Yes.

I believe it would not be# Your

Honor# —

By reason of this?

MR. RMJKs

and X even ~~ yes# Your Honor# and I

even -- »nd I point Your Honor's attention to an amendment

irrelevant to the point that they rely on, hut .is relevant
here,
On page 26 of their brief, -they refer to an amendment
that was offered, "The rights and remedies provided by this
title shall ba in addition to any and all other rights and
remedies at law or iniquity”, and that ware defeated.

And the

very purpose of that was to save those State lawsuits.
And that was defeated, sir.

Q

Well, maybe in State courts,

MR, RAUHj

it

I consider that exclusive in

both, in both State and federal courts,

X'ra not saying the

issue can’t be raised, the issue is raised on the pension in
a suit to remove Boyle as trustee, and it happened.

But that

is not in the election context,
Q

No, I!m — my question meant, only in elections.

MR, RMJHs

I don't believe it is possible.

of no case where it has happened.

I tow

And in — 1 would like to

just say that we haven't had to file a reply brief, we didn't
have time.

I’d like to just take one or two points in the
\

government's brief and make a quick speaking reply.
On page 17 of the government's brief, they talk about
how we'd slow it down and distort the planned procedure.
X call Your Honors’ attention to the fact that in
Scofield the Solicitor General's brief at pager; 29 and 30 is
almost the direct copy of all the terrible things that would

21
happen if people got in, and you let us in.
On page 26 **•* the bottom of 25# they suggest we left
a sentence out of a quote? but the sentence that we left out
says# "A careful reacting of the bill snakes clear that# except
where the bill provides specifically to the contrary" certain
•things.
Well# it is our contention# of course# that the bill
here does not specifically provide that we may not come in.
On page 26 is the very statute 1 mentioned before#
which tin® government says has something to clo with intervention#
but in fact what it had to do with was the right of saving
your private right in State courts under State remedies.
And finally# on page 28# there's a reference to a Hr*
Cor# who had a great, deal to do with the adoption of the
statute# and Mr. Cox, in the full quotation# makes perfectly
clear what he's talking about is the undesirabi11ty of
piecemeal litigation.

He thinks it should all be in one place#

and so do we.
In conclusion, I'd just like to say that the leaders
and members of Miners for Democracy# -.the Yablcnski faction,
have risked much in this struggle*
of that struggle.

This, suit is at the heart

Nothing has been shown to evidence

congressional intent# to keep us from the District Court
courtroom# and we would urge Your Honors to get ns there
promptly•

Thank vou.

MR. KAUHs
Q

Yes,, Your Honor.

Are yon suggesting that we decide this thing

MR. RAOHs

I'm not suggesting anything, Your Honor.

be very ~~
Q

Well, is it being bald pending our decision?

MR. RAUH:
your decision.

Wo, sir.

It is not being held pending

What happened, sir, was that — they ware

trying it, it started on September 13th.

The government asked

for a delay so they could do seme work on their case.
While that delay was in effect, counsel for the
Mins Workers died, so they postponed it for that reason.
Mew counsel has been obtained.

I explained to Your Honors

this morning that the new counsel was that counsel that had
bean excluded from the SOI case by virtue of being too close
to Boyle, but they will be there, and wa want to be there,
too.
But, as far:..as the date is concerned, well, of
course, X think it'd be presumptions for me to tell you when

m. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank yon* Mr. Ranh.

Mr, Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EKW.IM N. GRISWOLD. ESQ. ,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT SECRETARY OF LABOR
MR. GRISWOLDs

Mr. Chief .Justice, and may it please

the Courts
Before I begin, X would like to call attention to
tine brief which we have filed in this case.

For the first

time, in literally thousands of these briefs that X have seen,
the table of contents and table of cases is at the end instead

of at the beginning.

I haven’t any idea why it. happened.

The Government Printing Office has printed these; for 50, 75
years«,
As you will recall, the case is here on an expedited
schedule, and when I found this out on Monday I decided that
we would simply leave it as it is and not try to incur overtime
and whatnot and have it reprinted.
I’ve already found it something of an inconvenience
myself, because naturally you turn to the front, and I say
I’m sorry? but that’s what happened.

And there are some­

things even a Solicitor General can’t control.
The case here turns on the construction of a statute,
X believe, which is illuminated by the legislative history.

I do not think that I can demonstrate by logic,
like that involved in th© binomial theorem, that the result
for which I contend is inevitable#
X do think, or hops, that I can make about as
strong a case on legislative history as X can imagine, short
of demonstration, which X think should lead the Court to the
conclusion that the statutory provision should he construed,
to prevent intervention in this case»
Let me look first at the language of 'the statute to
which not much attention has been paid in the argument so
far, and I'm referring now to the brief of the 'Inited Mine
Workers, the blue-covered brief, which has the statutes
most comprehensively in the Appendix at the end.
Let me say also, by way of opening, that in this?
trial which is now going on, though it for the moment is in
recess, in the District Court, th© Secretary is vigorously
opposing the United Mine Workers on this particular aspect of
it relating to intervention.

.The Secretary and the United

Mine Workers are on the same side. The United Mine Workers
have yielded the time which -they could have had in this oral
argument to me, because they share our view that this is a
suit in the District Court which is, and ought to be, in th®
control of the Secretary.
But Mr. Combs here is representing the United Mine
Workers.

Now, Section 402 —
Q

May X ask, Mr. Solicitor, I take it the trial

judge is rather in a dilemma until we decide this, isn't he?
MR. GRXSWOLDs

Mo, Mr. Justice.

I understand that

he is going ahead on the basis of his decision, and the
decision of the Court of Appeals.

Should the case com® to a

conclusion before you decided it, I don’t know what ■would
happen.

I assume that if you should decide that intervention

is allowed, that ha would then reopen the record and allow
the presentation of the material which Mr. ''.uuh wonts
presented.
Q

Except that I gather Mr. Ranh wants more than

just to present that material, he wants to fight on the side
of the Secretary.
MR. GRISWOI^Ds

Yes, he wants — he wants, I assume

but ha would, I suppose, be entitled to recall witnesses
for cross-examination and other items of -that kind.

All of

this, I should think, is within the control of the trial judge,
and I

have not heard any suggestion that it. is not a. matter

which can foe worked, out.
Q

- There’s no jury involved?

MR. GSXSWOLDs

No jury involved.

And certainly if

the Court's decision is adverse to our position, the
Secretary will cooperate in trying to put the Court's decision
into practical effect.

But Section 402 of the statute,, which is the Labor*
Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, quite a
landmark in our labor*.*relations law.

Section 402 begins on

page 5a of the Appendis; to the brief.

And it says that:

• A member of a labor organisation who has exhausted
his remedies in the union, and, who has invoked ds available
remedies without obtaining a final decision within three
calendar months may file a complaint with the Secretary under
Section 481? and Section 481 sets cut, in considerable detail,
standards for the conduct of elections.
402(b) provides that the Secretary shall investigate,
arid if he finds probable cause to believe that a violation
has occurred, he shall bring a civil action against the labor
organization in the district court of the United States $ and
then Section 402(c) provides that if upon a preponderance of th
evidence after a trial on the merits, the court finds that an
election has not bean held within the time prescribed by
section 481 or (2) that the violation of

cation 481 of this

title may have affected the outcome of an election, the
court shall declare the election, if any, to be void and
direct the conduct of a new election under supervision of the
Secretary arid, so far as lawful and practicable, in conformity
with tha Constitution and Bylaws of the labor organisation,
And then I will proceed next to Section 403, which
is on the top of page 7a.

There is a first sentence there

27
which is not relevant to this case. but the next two -sentences
I think are both highly relevant':
"Existing rights and remedies to enforce tho
Constitution .and Bylaws of a labor organisation with respect
to ©lections prior to the conduct thereof shall not be
affected by the provisions of this subchapter."
Whatever rights there are. State or federal, still
remain.
And than the

t sentences

"The remedy provided by this subchapter for
challenging a» election already conducted shall be exclusive*,s
Q

And do you also agree with Mr. Rauh that that

pre-empts any state action?
I®. GRISWOLD?
Mr. Justice.

As to a suit after the election, yes

As to a suit prior to an election, not at all?

because it does not relate to a suit prior to an election.

Maw, X agree that it does not say "shall be
exclusive and this shall apply to intervention".

At no

place does the legislative history or anything else contain
the words "and this shall apply to intervention01.
And that's why 1 say I can't mathematically demon­
strate the result.
But I want to go ahead with the legislative history
of the statute, to show'that that language was deliberately
intended by Congress, it was not incidental or accidental?

and 'that the scheme which Congress meant to carry out by this
statute is one which would be frustrated by allowing inter­
vention of other parties than the Secretary»

What Congress

intended was not merely that the Secretary should file the
suit, but that he should control the suit.

And he will not

control the suit if intervention is allowed.
If Mr* Rat’ll*s client can intervene, any other union
member can intervene, including members of the opposition, and
the scheme which Congress deliberately set up in this difficult
and delicate area, would, 1 think, be clearly frustrated*
Now, -«die Labor-Management Disclosure Act perhaps
can be said to find its legislative genesis in­
was introduced by Senator Kennedy in May 1958.

bill which
And this

contains essentially the language which is now found in Section
402, with only a very few changes.
Senator Kennedy said that there had baen evidence
tli at “some, few unions have not conducted their affairs in a.
democratic manner, and since free secret elections are the
cornerstone of the democratic union raovenent, it appears
appropriate that public safeguards be established.”
And that is the first legislative statement with respect to
the language.
The bill introduced in May 1958 contained the
language that the remedies enunciated therein ware to be
exclusive, so that only the Secretary could bring such a

29
civil action.
This, incidentally, applied both before and after
elections.
Nothing much cams of that bill, but in June 1958
there was introduced another bill, S. .3974 of that Congress,
known as the Kennedy™Ives bill.

Senator Kennedy had built up

support- within the Senate, and this was passed by the Senate
on June 17, 1958, seven days after it was introduced.
Obviously showing that it had been worked on and agreed to by
a substantial number of Senators.
And the Committee Report with respect to Section 301
in that bill that5s now Section 401 states that these provisions
"are to be enforced by the Secretary of Labor, upon complaint
of any union member".

tod the report further stated

explicitly that "private court litigation would foe precluded"*
In the course of the Senate debate on June 12th,
1958, Senator Kennedy presented some of his reasons for giving
the Secretary the sole authority? Senator Wiley expressed his
concern that this would involve the "destruction of the
present rights of union members to seek State and Federal
court relief”, and Senator Kennedy responded that such
relief was costly and time-consuming and, as a practical matter,
unsatisfactory.

He- said that the bill chose rather to "provide

the right to appeal to the Secretary of Labor, whenever a
member believes that his rights, as provided in the bill in the

case of an election,- have bean denied to him.'5
Now, the petitioners in this case do refer in 'their
brief, on page 28, to a. statement of Senator Kennedy's in the
debate which they say points in their direction.

But, as Mr.

Rauh has already indicated, in giving the quotation on page
28 of their brief, they omit entirely the immediately
preceding sentence, which contains the language which he
read, except where the bill provides specifically to the
contrary.
And we contend that this bill does provida that
with respect to post-election relief, -Shat the enforcement
rights are solely in the Secretary.
Q

And X gather, Mr. Solicitor, does that position

take you to the point, however inadequate — let’s assume
may be the representation of the Secretary?
MR. GRISWOLD:

Mr. Justice, there's always, of course,

the situation of no good faith, of complete walking away and
not meeting your responsibilities.
Q

No, X wasn’t thinking so much of that as, in

this case Mr. Rauh urges on us that there are two questions,
two issues that that aide thinks ought to be submitted, and
litigated, and that, I gather, are not to be.
MR. GRISWOLD:
Q

Yes, Mr. Justice.

Now, you have agreed with him that the last

sentence of 403 precludes their seeking a remedy anywhere

31
else with respect to this election.
MR. GRISWOLD;
do not.

Anywhere «- no# Mr. Justice# we

And I think that’s important.
With respect to the question whether the past

election shall be set aside* we say it does preclude them
from seeking any remedy anywhere.

But we see no reason why

they are not free to maintain a suit with respect to the
forthcoming election.

Section 403 completely preserves all

rights with respect to any future election* and wa knew of no
reason why they cannot maintain a suit in the appropriate
court# I don’t know whether it would be State or federal# to
raise the question with respect to the pension payments.
They already have the suit pending with respect to
the validity of the pension increase.

It’s true it's not
Arid they have pointed

out in their brief that before this election* Mr. Yablcnski
was forced to initiate five suits in the District Court for*
the District of Columbia# to secure rights guaranteed him and
other UMWA members under the Act.

Well* do these two issues that they want

litigated in this action# don’t they — aren’t they addressed
to setting aside the past election?
MR. GRISWOLD; They are addressed to setting aside
•the past election# but the Secretary having made investigation
has decided that these are not grounds upon which he thinks it

appropriate to proceed, and we

Congress has made him the exclusive judge of that.

Well, that*a what I was trying to get to.

I gather, then, that as to this past election, those two
grounds may not be asserted anywhere
MR, GRISWOLDs As to the past election —
Q

—” under 403.

MR, GRISWOLDs As to the past election. I would
agree that those —
Q

Well, doesn’t that suggest that there is at

least a question, under -die last sentence of 24, "unless the
applicant’s interest is adequately represented- by existing
parties"?
MS. GRISWOLDs

Well, that — you mean under Rule 24,

with respect to
Q

What did X say?

MR. GRISWOLDs

I meant Rule 24,

And that — my answer to that would

be, in part, that Congress has allocated the determination of
this question to the Secretary, and that, under Rule 82 and the
enabling act, and decisions of this Court, the rule cannot
extend the jurisdiction of the District Court, which is
limited exclusively to actions by the Secretary*

And that that

would be inconsistent with the schema which the Secretary has,
which the statute has provided.
I would call attention to language of Rule 82. "These

33
rules shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdic­
tion of the United States District Courts,'*
And I would suggest that to say that the petitioners
here can intervene under Section 42, although it is established
that the suit by -the Secretary is the exclusive right, would
be extending the jurisdiction.

And 1 would call attention to

cases rueh as Sibbach v, Wilson and United Itatas v. Sherwood,
both at 312 U.S.

And in Sibbach v. Wilson, the Court-

referred to the inability of the court, by rule, to extend
or restrict the jurisdiction conferred by statute.
And if this statute means what it says, that the suit
by the Secretary shall be the exclusive remedy, then I think
that the construction of Rule 24, for which Mr. Rauh contends,
would amount to an extension of the jurisdiction, and, in
effect, an amendment of Section 403 as Congress has passed it.
Q

Mr. Solicitor General, suppose that we disagreed

with you that Rule 24{a} was irrelevant in this case, but
agreed with you that the Secretary is the only one that could
bring the action, and he’s the only one who can specify the
issue, but that, nevertheless, in trying out those issues
that he controls, 24(a) should have its normal operation?
would intervention then..
3

under 24(a) , be justified on

normal grounds?
MR. GRISWOLDs
it's hard to say.

I1 in not sure, Mr» Justice.

I think

Mr. Rauh says that my predecessor, who

34
represented the Secretary in the Court of Appeals, conceded
that in the Court of Appeals.

I am told that he does not so

understand what ha said.
But I think it is a question which, is vary difficult
for us.

It is really a question of whether the petitioners

here are adequately represented by the Secretary.
Now, it's perfectly plain that the Secretary is not
presenting every issue and every ground —
Q

Wall, 1811 put aside the issues.

MR. GRISWOLD:

All right.

Is not presenting every

augment that they would like to have presented.

And I think

that turns somewhat upon the question of what you mean by
representation, particularly in the light of a statute which
prescribes that a remedy shall be the exclusive remedy,
Mr. Rauh refers to an article by David Shapiro, in
which he holds open this question, but it isn’t clear to me
that Mr. Shapiro gave adequate weight to the ■— not merely
to the language of the statute that it shall he the exclusive
remedy, but also to the very clear legislative history.
I think the question of intervention is a question of
balance between many factors.
Q

Well, isn’t it *— as I read the opinion below,

they did not consider 24(a) on its own footing, except with
respect to the financial records and reports issued.

As with

respect to the other part of the case, they just said 24(a) was

irrelevant# in the sense that the statute itsel

th e labor

statute itself# precluded application of 24{a),
MR» GRXSWOLDs

I think that's very close to

accurate# Mr. Justice# and if one reads "exclusive” to mean
exclusive# then Section 24(a) becomes irrelevant.
Q

Well# if the court decided that that was error#

I suppose 24(a) should be considered, and X suppose the Court
of Appeals should consider it first.
MR. GRISWOLDs

That would depend entirely upon the

nature of the remand which this Court made# if this Court
remanded it to the Court of Appeals to consider# I assume
they would consider it.
Q

But what would you think would be the scop© of

their consideration on the subject?
MR. GRISWOLDs

I can't quite see# Mr. Chief Justice,

If the Court says that "exclusive"1 doesn't mean exclusive#
I find it somewhat difficult to see how a court could say that
any union member cannot intervene if he thinks he has a point
of view which isn't going to be fairly represented.

This

gets a little bit like the argument in the case which I
presented yesterday.
Q

Here is a case where I think Congress --

I was just thinking, Mr. Solicitor General#

that whether you're right or wrong# you certainly are
consistent.
(Laughter.)

36
MS, GRISWOLD?
Q

Hot always, Mr. Justice,

But —

I mean between yesterday and today,

MR, GRISWOLD:

— between yesterday and today , I am,

{Laughter,}
This is a —
Q

That the agencies of government can take care

of themselves, and the outsiders must be kept out,
MR. GRISWOLD:
G

Hot quits, Mr., Justice.

Well, almost, then.

MR. GRISWOLDs

When Congress says the outsiders

must be kept out.
Q

I understand, yes.

MR. GRISWOLD:

And when Congress deliberately

allocates a function to be handled by the Secretary and says
that that shall be exclusive in post-election suits.

It

does seem to me that it is entirely appropriate for the Court
to say that this is a matter which can properly be allocated
by Congress to the exclusive handling by the Secretary.
I repeat, this does not foreclose Mr. Rauh and his
clients from raising, in whatever appropriate court there is,
any issue, including -these two issues, in advance of any election,
including the election which will be conducted by the
Secretary.
Indeed, I am not sura that it precludes the Secretary
from filing a suit in connection with the holding of the

election under this suit in which he, in effect, asks for
instructions, asks for a declaratory judgment»
This is somewhat complicated by tills Court's decision
last spring in Hodgson v. Steel Workers case, which says that
the Secretary can't raise Issues in the 402 proceeding, which
were not presented to him by the employes»

But 7. ha not sure

after the 402 proceeding is completed, and it has been decided
that there shall be a new election, that the Secretary cannot
then raise in court questions with respect to tie conduct of
that election.

And 1 know of no reason why Mr. Ranh and his

clients cannot raise those questions in court with respect to
■idle conduct of an election.
Now, let me say that the position advanced here by
Mr. Rauh is a reasonable one, it was the view of a large part
of Congress, and the bill passed the House ones and, depending
how you interpret it, I think twice, the way he says; but the
other view is the one which .was finally enacted by Congress,
and both houses adopted it.

Via have set in our br;Le£ more legislative history,
including important statements by Professor Cor, who was
well known to be Senator Kennedy's immediate advisor in the
drafting of the Act, and, among other things, ha said that the
purpose of the bill was to centralize control of the proceedings
in the Secretary of Labor.
It was also Professor Cox who recognised and, I assume

prevailed on Senator Kennedy to accept the change, s o that
the exclusive suit by the Secretary was made applicable only
tc post-election proceedings.
The House adopted the bill in such a way that the
employee could bring the suit at any time.

There were hearings

before -the House Committee, in which Mr. Reilly m
essentially the same point that Mr. Justice White has been
making with me.

He said, "There is all the difference in the

world between having an administrative remedy and being able
to control the litigation yourself.
"Would you not rather prepare a case yourself and
present it than to go to an administrative agency?"
The House adopted the bill that way.

It went to

Conference and it came out of Conference in the form of the
Senate bill, with the language in the statute to which I have
referred, which seems to me to be, to use a word which has
come into our law recently, to be facially conclusive.
The exclusive suit by the Secretary, and which I believe is
thoroughly supported by the legislative history.
It is perfectly true the legislative history does not
say "and there shall be no intervention".

But it seems to me

to be very clear, or indeed the sort of question which the
courts are well qualified to decide, that it was the contempla­
tion and expectation of Congress that there should not be any
sort of interference with the suit brought by the Secretary;

that this was allocated to the Secretary for a very real
public purpose-

After all; when, there is a dispute about

art election, after the election has bean held, there is a
great deal of feeling in many quarters, and if you then have
the big, complete, comprehensive lawsuit in which all the
issues are raised and all the emotions are let out, the thing
becomes not only difficult but. perhaps unsatisfactory.
And the purpose was to filter this through the
Secretary of Labor-

And X may say that in this case he made

an enormous investigation with respect to what went on here.
And then have the Secretary decide which issues he. thinks are
the ones which should be presented in court.
And if we go through all that process, but, never­
theless , the union disputants can intervene on both sides',
and convert the lawsuit for setting aside an election and
providing for the conduct of a new election, convert that into
a general intra-union dispute settlement procedure, we have,
it seems to me, destroyed the very remedy which Congress
deliberately chose and established in these particular cases.
How, I agree that Rule 24(a) is there.
unimportant.

X don't say it is irrelevant.

seems to me, restricts its scops.

It’s not

Rule 82, it

And X think that, although

Rule 24(a) might in other settings be adequate to allow for
intervention here, generally, of course, intervention is
encouraged, it is welcomed? that was the function of enlarging

40
the scops i» Rule 24(a), font here there is a very special
reason for keeping the control of the suit in the Secretary*
That reason was explicitly intended by Congress• by a close
division, the House one way, the Senate the other way.

We

do not know what went on in the conference to load to the choice
of the Senate bill.
We do knew that both houses of Congress approved the
Senate bill, and provided in the law, as it has been since
1959, that the suit by the Secretary should b© exclusive, and
we think that "exclusiveB means that there should not ba
intervention.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RAUHs

Thank you, sir*

The learned Solicitor General has demonstrated that
we can’t start suit.

And when he says that the bill passed

the House the way we say, it didn't pass the House the way we
say, it passed the House saying the individual could start the
suit.

Nobody ever considered the position we take, namely,

that the Secretary can start the'suit, but intervention under
24(a) is something else.
Now, I would not have raised -the question that the

41
Secretary is vigorously opposing the UMWA.

But since the

learned Solicitor General raised that issuet 1 have to state to
the Court that in our opinion the case is not being prosecuted
with the vigor it should.
