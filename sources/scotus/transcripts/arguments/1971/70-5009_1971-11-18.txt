Mr. Spencer.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK E« SPENCER, ESQ.-,
OH BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SPENCERs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

•the Courts
I hope you won’t consider my comment too dramatic
under the circumstances, if I respectfully call to the Court’s
attention, at the cutset, that at tills time the petitioner
here is confined in the Central State Hospital for the Insane
in Indianapolis because of two charges which were filed
against him in May of ’68 charging the commission of two
robberies ten months before that, in 1967.
That there has been no hearing in respect to
probable cause.

That the petitioner is a deaf mute, neither

able to hear* nor tc speak, having a mental age of a -three or
four-year-old child.
Q

And that the prognosis —-

. You mean a four-year-old deaf child, don’t you?

MR. SPENCERs

Yes, sir.

I say he is.deaf, he is

unable to speak —
Q

Well, X just thought it was the aental age of a

three or four-year-old deaf child.
MR. SPENCERs

The witness at that instance emphasised

appre ci at© y cm r calling that to my attention.

that, and

And he will he confined? unless thin Court seep fit
to do something about it? for the rest of his life.
1 depreciate the contention of the Stats of Indiana
in this cause, that it makes no difference, that there
difference between a civil or criminal commitment in this
proceeding, and that he may recover, flying in the face of the
evidence which was heard by the trial court.
Q

Mr. Spencer, —

MR. SPENCSRs
Q

Yes, sir?

if he had been civilly committed, where would

he be confined today?
MR. SPENCER:

He would be at Muscatatuck, Your iao":

There are two institutions in Indiana, one at Fort Wayne and
one at Muscatatuck.

With his age and the area of the Stata

which he's from he would be at Muscatatuck.
The Supreme —
Q

Is this conceded by your opposition that he

definitely would be there?
r'

MR. SPENCER:

I don't -- well, they dispute it

to the extent that with a vail of words they say that he
couldn't get there.

1 don't think that they dispute that if

he ware in fact committed a feeble-minded person that he would
be at Muscatatuck,
They also repeat the statement of the Supreme Court

of Indiana# a very superficial statement, that?
to worry about# anyway# bt

there's nothing

ise as a charge of the Depsu ta

of Mental Health he could be transferred to Muscatatuck*
• It is our position that there is a great differo-; ce#
and that by the holding of our court.for the first time that
Muscatatuck is# by definition# under our statute, a
psychiatric institution and therefore that a transfer offd
made front the psychiatric institution at Central Stato
Hospital to Muscatatuck .does not answer the? problem.
He is not at Muscatatuck, and if he ware at
Muscatatuck# under a transfer# he. would still be held by
reason of the commitment of the criminal court.
Q

Didn *t your Supreme Court say# however# that#

irrespective of the route# he would be at the same placa?
MR. SPENCER:

They didn't say he. would be# they

said he could,
Q

And you're asking us not to accept that statement?
MR, SPENCERS

For practical purposes# I think there*

a world of difference# and it does not answer the probi'/:"-#
Your Honor.
The fact that they now hold# and this was a holding
for the first instance# and as far as I know there never has
been such a transfer.

They hold# as a matter or law now# in

this case# that the department# through

the Commissioner,

would have the power to transfer him to Muscatatuck.

But

6
that doesn't answer the problem because arriving at Muscafcatuck
under a transfer does not change the nature of his commitment.
And he has been committed as a person found to lie in
an Indiana statute designed for the use in instances in which
persons insane have been charged with crimes.
And under the judgment of the Criminal Court of
Marion County, he cannot be released until he has recover;!
his sanity.
Q

Now, I have- two subordinate question'- he re.

MB. SPENCERs
Q

Yes, sir.

When you use the word “insane" in the context

of that statute, what it means — well, I'm askings

does it

mean that he is incompetent to stand trial?
MR. SPENCERs

Well, under the statute, and I

dispute it, the position of the Indiana court in this regard,
the statute speaks in terms of insanity.

The determinative

principle as to whether or not ha will be committed on the
one hand, or held for trial on the other and go to trial, is
the determination of his comprehension or lack of comprehension
to understand the nature of the proceedings and to assist his
counsel in defense.
The State of Indiana, through the Attorney

General,

has taken the position that that is insanity? and not only that,
but that is the same insanity, to use that word, as contemplated
in the section of the statute in regard to what 1 refer to as

7
a civil commitment/ which requiri
that a physician certify that the person for whoa application
is made is not insane.
I don't see any great difficulty involved in
differentiating between the two.

The statute fca respect to ~

person, charged with crime contemplates that some persons, not.
all, who are insane will be found to lack comprehension/ to
understand the nature of the proceedings/ and to''assist in
their defense.

And those persons * not only the ones who is

insane but those persons who are found to lack comprehension
shall be. committed.
On the other handy there is no standard in respect
to the civil commitment of a feeble-minded person to Jirreafaturr.
except that which 1 respectfully submit is now generally
considered and denominated a minor illness.

The statute —

excuse me.
Q

Now, right there is ray second question, and

then I’ll let you proceed.
I’ve read both briefs, and they seem to speak of
this feeble-minded commitment procedure you have and also the
one in the criminal context.

Does Indiana also have a third

procedure for the commitment of the mentally ill?
MR. SPENCERs
Q

Yes, sir.

I find this unsaenticned in either brief.

MR. SPENCERs That is correct.

.8

Q

And this is because it is of no rsignificsncn

here?
MR. SPENCER i

X do not think it is of any '-'igniti-

canoe^ except to render questionable, or at least indicate
question in regard to the State's position that insanity* in
the statute for commitment* has reference to the same insanity
and the same concept of insanity in the provision in the
criminal proceedings•
There is a difference, .Persons who are insane sr
be committed unde? an entirely separate procedure.
we're speaking now of persons who are mentally all,

Persons —»
Persons

who are committed to Muscatatuck and the school at Fort
Wayne are committed because they are feeble-minded, and the
Legislature for a long period of time has determined, ar- a
matter of policy, that those persons who are mentally ill
should not be so committed, that -they go cents place else, '
And therefore has provided this condition precedent that a
physician certify that they are not insane.
The provision in regard to the person charged with
crime, dealing with persons who are insane, is only concerned
with the one aspect of mental illness s

whether or not there

is such mental illness there that the effective result is that
they lack the comprehension to understand the nature of, the
proceedings and to assist in their defense.
To me that does not equate the terminology of

9
insanity in the. one statute with the tosmainolcgy of.

tv

as negative, as a condition precedent-, in the other statute.
We're talking about two different things.
And X think that -the existence of the seprmfe
procedure for feeble-minded persons emphasises what X *ra talking
about, even though both statutes have existed for a long time
in Indiana.
If it has come up before. I’m not aware of it.
This is the first instance that I know of in Indiana where a
feeble-minded person has been committed under this statute
designed to take care of the person with a mental illness who
lacks comprehension to understand the nature of the chargesagainst him, and who, therefore, is committed until "he shall
become sane".

Until he shall regain that much comprehension

in spite of his prior existing mental illness.
I’d like to call — I'd like to invite your attention
to soma statements made by the State of Indiana —* excuse me,
I'd better go back for just a moment in regard to how this
developed.
It is vary clear in the transcript, and X have set
out in the Appendix, at the conclusion of the hearing held in
the trial court.

This contemplates the appointment of two

physicians, and these two physicians were appointed and
testified. Dr. Nie and Dr. Schuster, also the superintendant
who had worked with this man, who had experience and background

10

at the deaf school* had worked with this Kan in attempting to
communicate* and was available to the two
examined him? arid there is no dispute in the toshlmo.vy
the court that this is a condition that will reaain, thot
we're not talking about a mental illness* we're talking abort

z.

retardation.
It is a condition that does exist and has existed.
A retardation. And -the fact -that this man is oven v~'
understand and comprehend the usual sign language of the 'or:
mutes.

Just a very* very small amount of that can he even

comprehend.
To emphasise the limitations of his comprehension*
in his testimony* this supervisor informed the court that the
man has no comprehension of time* he has no comprehension or
when* he has no comprehension of how.
And then* as 1 state* the -~
Q

Welly would you say — let’s suppose the Stats

had proceeded to commit your client as a feeble-minded
parson under -- what is it* Section 1907?
MR. SPENCERs
Q

Yes* sir.

— and they committed him in accordance with

the procedure outlined by the statute and put. him in the
institution* Muscatacat, or whatever it is* and that he was
there now.

Would you say the State could keep him there for

as long as his condition didn't improve?

1.1

MR, SPENCER:

Well, at the conclusion of your

question you used the word which the State has used* which I
dispute,

It is not a matter as. to whether or not bo improwa.3,

as contended by the State.
Q

Well, 1 just wanted to know whether your conten­

tion is that before the State may restrain a person far - v ■
long as this young man has been restrained or will be
restrained, there must be some finding that, in the prooc
somewhere, he is dangerous to himself or others.
MR. SPENCER:
not my contention.
Q

Noe that is not a necessity, r.nd ftu.its

The determination must be made *»-

So you are saying that the State may take

custody of the feeble-minded person, even though he is net
dangerous to himself or others, and keep him?
MR. SPENCER;
a sole determination.
Q

That may be a determination.

Well, you say that without that kind of finding

MR. SPENCER:
Q

Whether or not he is dangerous it not

Yes, sir.

-- they may take custody of -the feeble-minded

person and keep him -MR. SPENCER:
0

Yes, sir.

“-in custody.

MR. SPENCER:

If he needs treatment, if the interest

of society — as he is in fact feeble-minded, and if the
interest is there, ha can be —

12
Q

All right.

If he needs treatment* the State

way keep him in custody while- they*.re giving it to him?
MR. SPENCERS

Absolutely.

There6® no question about

tli at.
Q

What if it’s just custodial care and not

treatment?
MR. SPENCERs

Well, I'm not going to take the position

that the care offered by the State of Indiana at Muscatatuck
is merely custodial.

And, as far as I'm concerned, if he

were committed on a civil commitment of this fashion, he.
would be receiving more than custodial care.

They have a good

setup.
The difference lies not in hew ha53 being treated,
but in how, when, and under what circumstances he is able co
be released, and what the attitude is.
There is no chance, the way he has bean committed,,
in the criminal proceedings, merely because of the pendancy
of two criminal charges, for which there's never even been a
hearing as to probable cause,
'

Q

Well, does he —

MR, SPENCER: There

is no chance he will ever be

released.

Q

Does the existence of the criminal bar now

prevent a commitment under the feeble-mindedness statute?
MR. SPENCER:

Mo, sir.

But it is a moot question.

Because lie is -~
Q

Would you —

MR. SPENCER:

— he is in fact in the custody of tho

State.
Q

Would you resist such a procedure?

MR. SPENCER:

Q

^

No, sir.

If one were instituted?

MR. SPENCER:

No, sir.

But I would resist doing

anything that would not also include the dismissal of the
criminal charges.
Q

Why is that?

MR. SPENCER?

Because he cannot be released uncor

any circumstances as long as the present commitment stands,
based upon the existence of the two criminal charges.

He

cannot be released until he recovers his sanity.
Q

Well, why don't ~

MR. SPENCER?

Something that he never lost, except

in terms of comprehension,
Q

I sort of thought you were claiming that if a

person is charged with a crime and he can't stand trial because
he's incompetent to understand the proceeding, that the State,
while they may keep their criminal charges pending, can’t
just leave him in jail forever unless he represents a. danger
to himself —
MR. SPENCER:

No, sir, that is not my position.

There

14
are parsons who are —
Q

Well,, it must be

ME. SPENCERs
Q

— taking the position.

—* it must be in effect your position, because

you say the criminal charges must be dismissed.
MR. SPENCERs

No.

I — let me say this?

Became

of the aspects in this case, lie is not only a daaf mute unokle
to communicate, but. he has a mental age of three or four
Q

1 understand that.

MR. SPENCER;
feeble-minded.

— and in these circumstances he is

Ha should he in Muscatatuck.

There is no

basis for 'the existence of the criminal charges, as a matter
of fairness and justice.

These prevent hie civil commitment

because they are the basis of his criminal commitment.
Q

Well, yes, but the department of mental health
r

apparently can transfer him right now to Kuscatatuck, or
whatever that name is.

:

MR, SPENCERs

That’s what the Supreme Court says.

Q

It seams to me like the State court has

addressed itself to many of the State law Issues that you are
bringing before us now.
MR. SPENCERs

If the Court please, the State court

did not address itself to

the basic issue involved, as to

the applicability of the statute and the result..
at the outset what the —

They related

.15

Q

Well, in any event, isn’t that a State law

question?
MR. SPENCERs

No, sir.

Absolutely not.

This man

may be in prison for life, and he has never had a trial, and
cannot get out under any procedure.
Q

I know, but they — concededly, he can be

placed in the institution you want him placed in.
MR. SPENCER! And can never get out.
And on a civil commitment he can get out. merely
on the determination of the superintendent that it is in
his interest, and that it’s okay, in effect.
Q

So you are claiming — you are claiming that the

State may not charge a person with, crime and then keep him in
jail forever, just because ha’s incompetent to stand trial?
You say it’s unconstitutional to
MR. SPENCER;
that.

No, I think this case is broader than

I think this case is broader than that.
Q

Well, that's pretty broad.

But you are —■ you do -- well, anyway? whatever your
broad claim is, it includes that one?
MR. SPENCER! That is a part of it. That is correct.
But. only on the facts of this case.
I am not going to contend before you that all of the
law should be changed so there should be a tremendous upheaval.
Maybe yes; maybe no.

But under these circumstances, even the

IS
State of Indiana concedas that there was no —- that them is
no criminal responsibility here,

tod yet the basis for his

being maintained is the existence of the criminal charge.
1 invite your attention —
Q

What would happen if yon instituted feeble­

minded commitment proceedings# and he were so committed today?
Would the State dismiss its criminal charges out of has -d?
ME. SPENCER:

Thera is nothing that the State can do

at this point, as far as I can see# because the ccraiitTrsrt,
unless you do something about it# is a final judgment.

At

any given point along the way# the State could have disrdssoed
tiie criminal charges.

But there is a judgment rendered, and

except for the disposition in this Court# it has become vital.
And he will be held until ha is certified sans# and that he
will never be.
Q

Mr. Spencer# let me try one hypothetical now.
*

MR. SPEHCSRs
Q

Yes# sir.

Purely hypothetical.

Suppose we held that

there is a violation of clue process in these circumstances #
that holds such a person as your client in confinement in an
institution for more than whatever reasonable time is required
to determine his capacity to stand trial# and that at the
expiration of that reasonable time he must be civilly
committed# if he is to be confined at all.
your problems?

Would that satisfy

17
MR. SPENCER: Well, it would certu.lnl

'

a setter

help to the problem.
Q

Well* what more would you want than that's

MR. SPENCER:

As far as I'm concerned# the jvigr,,7,ni

of the lower court should be reversed,
Q

Well# just take the things I posed.

That we

said after a reasonable time — assume also# add to the.
hypothetical# that we would say that nine years is obviously
a reasonable time# and that they must now begin proceedings
to commit him civilly within 90 days or discharge him from
custody.

Would that give you all the relief you wanted?
MR. SPENCER:
Q

No.

What else would you want?

MR. SPENCER:

The man has already bean in there for

three years —
Q

But ha's going out in 90 days unless# on this

hypothetical, unless civil proceedings are commenced.
MR. SPENCER:

Well# if this Court would determine

that as of the time of your decision that the State must take
such action# that would he the relief.

If it’s that you will

keep him there for another seven or eight years —
Q

No.

Ninety days I've said.

Ninety days* they

must, commence the civil proceeding within 90 days or discharge
him from custody.

want?

Haven't you got then all the relief you

18

ME. SPENCERs

If I understand yen correctly - yes.

The thing that I strenuously object to is the prospectiveapplication of the judgment throughout the life of the man
who has been charged»
q

There xs no possibixity of relea ••©«

There is no judgment in the hypothetical I have

given you,
MR. SPENCERs

q

Yes, sir*

It's merely a proceeding# arid if they can’t

sustain the burden of proving that he must be eeraaittad

insist that they dismiss the criminal charges ss part of
this process if he got the relief I’m talking about, do you?

MR. SPENCERs

If there was nothing further done on

the criminal charges, and if he were civilly committed, no,
3: wouldn’t care.
What would happen as far as the charges, that would
take care of itself.
those charges.

But they have proceeded by reason of

The way things stand now.

So that he is

committed merely by reason of the existence of tnose
charges„
If he were civilly committed, so that he could be
released just on the basis of the determination of the
superintendent at Muscatatuck, that under the circumstances

19
that’s what should be done? that’s what the, statute amounts to.
I don’t think that two, three, four
from the time that ha goas in, that the State is going to be
interested in proceeding in respect of the criminal charges.
I invite the Court’s attention to the statement made
by the State of Indiana at page 4 of the brief of to - respondent,
stating that s

"Should Jackson recover,

...’his present

incompetency could effectively absolve Jackson of all
criminal responsibility for the acts of robbery themselves,
even though there has been no trial on the merits to detemina
whether Jackson committed the acts charged and if so whether
he was criminally responsible at the time they were committed."
But what the State is asking is that -you postpone that
determination, or that that determination be postponed until
he has recovered his sanity, which will never be.
And this is what they refer to in their brief as
"the Indiana solution".
And they additionally point out for the edification
of this Court that his incompetency does not bar the State from
charging robbery, even though no further proceedings may be
had.
In this situation it is the same as if they were
charging a three-year-old child, and, in essence, they are
griping about the power that the State has to bring the charge,
to cause a life commitment, because of the existence of the

charge, when they in fact admit that under these cireamstones
when they get along to determining it, after infimty, that
there wasn't and never has been any criminal responsibility.
I started to mention a few minutes ago, and 1 want
to point that out, that the court; the trial court, even
though -idie Supreme Court; three judges of it, didn’t appear
to be particularly bought, the trial court was concerned abon
the result that was impending in these proceedings.
He made the comment at the conclusion, inquiring as
to whether the attorney then representing the defendant fait
that any other statute could be used,
that attorney ~~ who, by the way $

had then he directed

clS a pauper counsel

directed that attorney to file a motion for a new trial;
agreeing with him that this determination was an appealable
determination.

And he has maintained his interact that tin

matter be pursued for final solution.
Q

"He", being the judge or —

MR. SPENCER; The judge.

The judge was very much

disturbed by what appeared to foe the necessary result in the
application of this statute, and X respectfully submit that
on its face this statute was designed for an entirely
different circumstance, and it is an aberration to apply to a
situation like this.

And I respectfully submit that the

only solution, as a matter of due process, is that the State
be allowed an opportunity to obtain civil commitment, and the

21
criminal charges be dismissed, or even if they*re going to
pend; at least that no further proceedings be had and that
this commitment until he recovers his sanity be vacated,
Q

Let's come back to your Indiana procedure.

May only the State institute a proceeding for commitment for
feebls-raindedness ?
MR. SPENCER:
Q

Yes, Your Honor; ~-

A relative could not?

MR. SPENCER:
and the State, no.

You could not?

Differentiating between the court

The court can initiate it, when anything

comes to his attention which raises a question as to the
comprehensive ability of the defendant.

The defendant6s

counsel can do it, the prosecuting attorney can do it, the
court, -the judge in open court ~
Q

Well, precisely.

In other words, you could do

it if you wanted to, by a petition?
Q

Not on civil commitment.

MR. SPENCER;

You8re talking about under the criminal

statute?
Q

Under civil commitment for feeble-mindedness.

Who may institute that proceeding under Indiana law?
MR. SPENCER;
Q
Q

Any resident in the county.

Any representative —
Well, then, S go back to, of course, what I asked

a long time ago.

22
ME. SPENCERs
Q

Reputable, yes, sir.

What's the barrier to doing this and thereby

unraveling this procedural semantic difficulty ir your State?
MR. SPENCER*

Because of the oubstrrding go’.v:-,it" - " ?

from which we're appealing.
Q

How do you know that?

Have you tried that

remedy, as Justice Blackmim has suggested?
MR. SPENCERs

Judge, Your Honor, 1 know of no

precedent anywhere in the law that the persons involved in a
litigation as against whom a final judgment has? been rendered,
particularly coercive, in commitment can at any given paint
merely ignore it.

Xt*s there, and he is in fact being held

in custody by reason of -fills»
Mow, if we add another civil commitment to it, or
ten commitments, it will not erase or change the fact that
until the judgment of -the trial court is set aside committing
him under the statute designed for the insane person, until
he shall recover his sanity, ha cannot he released.
Q

Well, isn't that part of your application for

relief, in your foeble-mindedness procedure, to ask that the
other judgment be set aside?
MR. SPENCER!
Q

That could not be dona, no.

Why?

MR. SPENCERs

That would be a collateral attack or

a judgment in an entirely separate case.

23
Q

Isn’t it in the seta© court?

MR. SPENCER: Beg pardon?
Q

Isn’t it in the same court?

MR. SPENCER:

No, sir.

No, sir.

The court in which

these proceedings were had has criminal jurisdiction op.’
.ly.
i:

The civil commitment would be in our Superior or Criminal
Court,

and, as the State has also pointed out, as long

ers the.

present commitment stands, we have a judicial coteritlrat:'.

defendant, that he is insane.

i t

And they contend it’s tb*?

v.

concept of insanity, and until this is set aside end vacate; d,
it would be a complete bar to a determination in the civil
proceedings that he is not insane.
Q

Well, what about State habeas?

Do you have habeas corpus in Indiana?
MR. SPENCER:
Q

Yes, sir.

Does it lie to relieve one from a claimed

illegal custody pursuant to a criminal proceeding?
MR. SPENCER:

Well, whether or not it would in some

instance, where no appeal had bean pursued, I don’t knew.

It

could not lie here.
Q

Because you've already —

MR. SPENCER:

An appeal was pursued? and the highest

court in the State of Indiana has affirmed the.commitment.
Q

Wall, did you raise in that court all of the

24
grounds you're raising here?
MR. SPENCER:

Yes, sir.

Well, how about federal habeas?

Q

MR. SPENCER:

If you had denied certiorari, 1 would

You accepted certiorari, and it’s your baby, and

try it.

1qra very happy to be here now.
Q

1 know, but it seems to me there; are r. few

Everybody —
MR. SPENCER: The State contends that? 2 roe nccr.
X don81 see the necessity —
Q

You

have some major differences between the
V

two of you —
MR. SPENCER:
Q

Yes, sir.

— for example, on whether or not this p rson

was committed as an insane person, whether this person is a
feeble-minded person, whether commitment under -the 1907 is
available to this particular person under the Indiana law?
all of them are argued here before us in the briefs.

You have

r.

major differences between you, that rests on State law.
MR. SPENCER: Well, the major difference — major in
the nature of the conclusion, not major in the nature of the
basis.
I submit that it's a veil of words as far as the
.attorney General is concerned.

That there are no major differ-

25
ences in terns of the facts.

X think their concession here in regard to incompetence
is in direct conflict with many of the other assertions which
they make.
Thank yon* gentlemen.
Q

Your basic constitutional argument closely

parallels the dissenting opinion of Justice DeBruier of
Indiana Supreme Court?
MR. SPENCER; Absolutely.
Q

Yes* sir.

Trial counsel is, you say, is assigned counsel?

Because Jackson is an indigent.

Trial counsel was assigned hr

the court?
MR. SPENCER:

Yes, sir.

As are we.

all the way.
Q

What explains the change in counsel?

MR. SPENCER;
Q

No change.

We are pauper counsel.

But you said you didn't represent him at the

trial.
MR. SPENCER;

Oh, I’m sorry, 2 misunderstood you.

As a matter of procedure, with which X certainly approve, and
it's been a custom for some time, our two criminal courts in
Marion County do not appoint the same attorney to proceed on
appeal as was in the trial.
they did there.

We have the benefit of everything

They're to confer with.

But over a long

period of time, as a matter of practice, they appoint another

attorney to proceed with '

appeal in any criminal case*

Thera is nothing there than the matter of eastern
and determination of policy*

Thera3» nothing in this carm

that called for that*
Q

That leaves counsel on appeal free to make tho

claim that there was ineffective assistance of counsel at the
trial?
MR* SPENCER:
Q

Occasionally.

Bo they get paid in the State system?

MR, SPENCER:
Q

Occasionally.

Yes* sir.

Under a State counterpart of the Criminal

Justice Act?
MR, SPENCER:
Q

Beg pardon?

MR. SPENCER:
Q

Pretty much case law. Your Honor,

Pretty much case law in Indiana.

It’s paid by the State?

MR. SPENCER: The County Treasurer, yes, sir.
But it is not a statutory procedure set up.
Thank you, sir.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHELDON A. BRESKOW, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BRESKOWs
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

May I present my associata at the counsel table with

?
me, Professor James Beavers of the Indiana University Law
?

School, and Assistant Attorney General Robert Colper,
May it please the Courts
Faced with the dilemma concerning Jackson's erudition
as described by petitioner in his argument, jr-:! 1 what was
Indiana to do?

Indiana had three alternatives;

Indiana could try Jackson anyway.

Indiana coni'

discharge him by dismissing the criminal charges against him*
Or Indiana could do what it did, and that is coamitment to an
appropriate psychiatric and rehabilitative institution until
Jackson gained the necessary comprehension to he tried.
In order to make its choice, Indiana looked to fto
decisions of this Court, and found that in Fata _ys. Robin ■
it would have been a Fourteenth Amendment violation to try
Jackson.
It was conceded by the State in that jour'g is, 7: vc
decision, that the defendant in that case would have been —
it would have been a Fourteenth Amendment violation to try
him, but the court went on to say, in its opinion, that it was
error, and a Fourteenth Amendment violation for the court not
to give the defendant in that case a competency hearing on his
own motion, even when it was not specifically requested by
counsel in Pate vs. Robinson,
' So the Fourteenth Amendment precluded Indiana

28
from trying Jackson.
The second alternative, that Jackson be released on
a dismissal of -die criminal charges, was not appealing or
appropriate to Indiana.

It was not constitutionally required,

respondent submits, certainly not by the equal protoetio:argumenfc and the cruel and unusual punishment argument tknt
petitioner makes to this Court by its brief,

.Aaci it was that

the peace and dignity of Indiana was offended by the cc-nvir
of the two robberies, with which Jackson was charged.
To release him and discharge him would have fort': er.
offended the State, and would have offended Mrs. Parley rr.
Mrs. Lyons, the alleged victims.of those robberies.
Q

What about civil commitment?

MS. BRESKOWs
Q

Pardon, Your Honor?

Civil Commitment.

MR. BRESKOWs

Your Honor, the state*s position

is essentially this, and it was the position of Judge

Artebern in the Supreme Court of Indiana8s decisions The

commitment as such.

Jackson, by his commitment —

Do you call this a civil commitment?

MR. BRESKOWs

I do.

A civil commitment for life?

MR. BRESKOWs

It is not.

It would be for life if

he were committed under any statute, Your Honor, if he is not

Our Supreme Court said that Jackson

could go to Muscatatuck School for feeble-minded.
Q

Well, he could be placed there by the department.

MR. BRESKOW!

By the department.

And the vehicle

by which he gets there is precisely what Mr. Justice Blackmon
was pointing out to counsel for the petitioner.

That some

responsible citizen in the county in which Jackson resides
files a petition for civil commitment.
Q

Could that be done now?

MR. BRESKOW:

Yes, Your Honor.

But X submit you'd

have this very same result by taking that tack as you do in
the instant-case, because he5s committed under either
statute to the Department of Mental Health at the discretion
of the Commissioner for placement.

There is a full-blown hearing, with rights of

petitioner to be present, cross-examined, call his own
witnesses, which he did in this case by his counsel; and at
the conclusion the commitment order is ra viewable by the
appellate court in Indiana.
Now, compare, if you will, Your Honor, —

MR. BRESKGWS
Q

Yes.

— but someone had initiated a

civil commitment,

and he were now in either place under civil commitment, and he
wanted out.

How could he initiate a proceeding to get out?

MR, BRESKOWs

He could file a habeas corpus, Your

Honor.
Q

Only by a habeas?

35
MR, BRESKOWs

He could file a habeas corpus.

I

presume that be would also have the opportunity to petition
the court, to claim that he is now sane.

He coaid do it

better -Q

Well, you don’t know, you just say you 'assume

that?
MR* BRESKOWs

Yes,

But he could do it better,

because ha attacks the discretion of the superintendent in
saying that he is not, and therefore he is being illegally
detained by habeas corpus, Your Honor.

That’s the appropriate

remedy that he would have.
Q

Yon mean Jackson’s remedy is only habeas corpus?

MR. BRESKOWs

Jackson’s remedy is habeas corpus, if

Jackson is sane,
Q

That is competent, can comprehend?

MR. BRESKOWs
Q

Yes, sir.

Well, if he files habeas corpus, would he have

a full“Scale due process hearing?
MR. BRESKOWs
Q

Yes, he would, Your Honor.

On the question whether he’s now sane?

MR. BRESKOWs

Yes, he would, Your Honor. Both in

State court and in federal court.
Q

Well, Jackson is not eligible now for any

furloughs?
MR, BRESKOWs

Let me say this, Your 'donor —*

37
Q

Well? is he or isn't he?

MR, BRESKOWs
Q

Yes,

At this place?

MR. BRESKOWs
Q

Jackson —

Mo.

All right.

Mot where he is not1/.

That’s what X want.

At this place

he is not eligible for any furloughs?
MR, BRESKOWs
Q

That is right.

If ha had been committed civilly as a feeble­

minded person, and had bean placed in this particular prison,
or hospital —
MR. BEESKOW %
Q

Not where he is now, Your Honor.

Well, let’s assume he had been placed — you

say that he could have been.
MR, BRESKOWs

He could not have been placed in

Central State Hospital, Your Honor.

That is not for feeble-

minded.
Q

Well, you told me just a while ago, or told

Justice Brennan, that if this man — if Jackson had been
committed as a feeble-minded person, the Department of Mental
Health could still have placed him in the very institution
where he is now.
MR. BRESKOWs
Q

Yes,

Well, let’s assume he had been placed in that

institution.
MR. BRESKOWs

All right.

All right.

38

Q

After a commitment for feebie-mi-idednass.

Would .ae then be eligible for furloughs?
MR. BRESKOW:

No, probably not, because it isn't the

institution that carries a furlough proposition.

Q

All right.

So he would have to be put in

Muse- —
MR. BRESKOW:

Q

Muscatatuck.

— Muscatatuck in order to be eligible for

furloughs?
MR. BRESKOW:

Q

And he would be placed there naif?

MR. BRESKOWs
Q

Yea,

Yes.

And until he is placed there at the discretion,

no furloughs?
MR,, BRESKOW:

Yes, that's precisely it, Your Honor.

But because of the nature of the institution, not
the nature of the commitment.
Q

Well, why no furlough at the Central State
/

Hospital?
MR. BRESKOW:

I don't know.-

Classically, and

!h i o tori cal ly, Central State Hospital was for more serious cases
Q

Well, have you ever known a person committed

■•tinder the feeble-minded, Section 1907, to have been placed in
the facility that Jackson is in?
MR. BRESKOW:

Mo, I don't.

39
This is a case of first impression, as petitioner
would have you say — have you understand.

Thera has never

been a decision in Indiana that someone committed for noncomprehension is able to be sent to Muscatatuck „

But; it's

reasonable to say that, with the 167 amendment of the
Indiana statute that equates mental institution with
psychiatric institution, and makes no distinction, and allows
the Commissioner to have discretion in the matter.
Q

But even so, as I understand it, ether than the

differences in furloughs, no matter where Jackson is confined,
that if he*s to have any release, he has to initiate a habeas
proceeding under your practice to got it?
MR. BRESKOW: That would be my understanding.
Together with — I'll have to equivocate. Your Honor.

I would

think he would be in a position to petition the court, the
committing court, and claim his sanity.
There are nine ways to get into mental institutions,
nine vehicles by the Indiana statutory scheme.

They

overlap, they repeal by implication, they supersede in part,
but in spite of all that, our position is that all the
statutes procedurally treat the committee alike, procedurally.
Certainly the criteria might foe different, as Mr. Justice
Marshall pointed out to me.

Hon-comprehension in the one

instance against mentally feeble-minded and needing care
because you can't take care of yourself.

40
Q

Well, now, in this instance, 1 guess it is a

practical fact, that this being a non-comprehension commitment,
Jackson, who's now 27, is he?
MR* BRESKOWs

He must be about 30 now. Your Honor*

He was 27 at the time of the case.

Q

Thirty.

Well, he's there for fcha rest of h.v

life unless he can establish that comprehension lias been
restored,

Is that right?
MR. BRESKOWs

Yes.

Now, let me take ths edge off

that a little bit, Mr. Justice*
He has two ponding criminal cases.

They are

presently pending in the Marion Criminal Court in Indiana,
Presumably the Marion Criminal Court judge would inquire
periodically as to the welfare of Jackson*
Particularly in light of recent history, in the
need to dispose of cases, to move cases —
Q
you've told us,

But I gather, on those offenses, from what
that it's possible that under consecutive

sentences a conviction for those two four-dollar robberies,
he could get 50 years, couldn't he?
MR. BRESKOWs
Q

Yes, sir.

So that means that he’d be there at least 30

years before he’ll have served the possible time he could
serve for those robberies?
MR. BRESKOWs

Yes, sir.

And it's interesting to note that the Hew York
statute, that attempts to handle a problem of this kind, says
that the criminal charges must bo dismissed if the length of
time in commitment is more than two-thirds of the sentence#
In this case, it would ba something like 32 to 37 years.
Q

But you don't even have that much in the

statute, do you, in Indiana?
MR. BRESKOW%
more.

We have more, Your Honor.

We hays

We have the opportunity for Jackson to periodically

petition and file habeas corpus —
Q

But I mean if he fails to establish comprehension

MR. BRESKOW;
Q

Yes.

Yes.

He'll lose all those applications, wouldn't he?

Yes.

He would, anyway, under the civil commitment
And he would go to the mental health department

under those statutes.
Q

Well, he spent the first 27 years of his life,

apparently, with his mother.

He had two jobs, one in

Mississippi and one in Indiana.

Wouldn't he, under your

statute, had he been civilly committed to this unpronounceable
name place, had perhaps been dischargable under your Indiana

«aid colony when, in the judgment of the superintendent, the
mental and physical condition of the patient justifies it?

But Indiana, I don't — if there had never been

Because it would be redundant, Your

He is in — under the same sort of procedure that he

Q

Well, there's never been — there's never been

any — it's never been established in Indiana yet that he's

MR. BRESKOW:
Q

That’s true.

That's true,

Welly I don't see why you would think it’s

redundant.
MR. BRESKOW:

The Ccmmissloner of Mental Health ,

I submit to you, Your Honor, could make that determination
unilaterally, without a court, and could transfer Jackson to
Muscatatuck.
Q

Well, maybe he could, but 1 thought maybe —

I thought maybe Jackson had the right to a hearing on whether
he's feeble-minded or not.
MR. BRESKOW:

The criteria, Your Honor, the criteria

in order to meet one institution or another is determined by
the Mental Health Commissioner.
Q

Well, 1 know, but — I know, but that's all

on the assumption that the State is entitled to hold him just
because he can't -understand the criminal charges.
MR. BRESKOW:

As I say to you, Your Honor, that would

be significant but in Jackson's case,
With the condition of Jackson, as it's been described
here,
Q

Mr. Breskow, I wonder if you could address

yourself to the hypothetical question 1 put to your friend,
namely:

What would the State of Indiana do now if,

hypothetically, this Court said due process requires that he

46
can be held as he's new being held only for a period
reasonably long enough to determine whether he is competent
to stand trial or whether, forsseaably, will be competent
to stand trial? and then, after that, he must be released
unless a civil commitment is started within 90 days.
What would you do, in fact,

as counsel for the

State, what would you recommend?
MR. BRESKOW:

I would have to recommend a civil

commitment proceeding be started, Your Honor.
Q

Well, if the civil commitment proceeding had

been started, let's say, six months ago or a year ago, you
wouldn't be here perhaps.
MR. BRESKOW:

If he were transferred to Muscatatuck

we probably wouldn't be here, either, Your Honor,
Q

Well, —

MR. BRESKOW $
Q

But that is probably true ■*»-

— that's up to the administrator, that's

administrative —
MR. BRESKOW:

That's probably true, Your Honor,

But 1 want to re-emphasise, Your Honor, that it would be
redundant, because it doesn't matter under which statute he
goes ultimately to trie Commissioner of Mental Health in
Indiana.
Q

Well, it may be redundant as an administrative

matter, but perhaps not as a constitutional problem.

Mid

47

1 was addressing myself to, and you’ve answered

MR. BRESKOW:

But didn’t you say that you know of no other

case where a feeble-minded had ended up in the Central State
Hospital?
MR. BRESKOWt

Q

I don't know of a case personally,

And, as I say, ~
What is this Court to decide?

MR. BRESKOWs

~ the Jackson case# decided in- *71,

■was a case of first impression with respect to sending people
to Muscatatuck under the non-comprehension proviso.
Q

Certainly where he is now- he has no furlough

possibility? he would have it in Muscatatuck?
MR. BRESKOWs

Yes, sir.

Because of bhe nature of

the institution, not the nature of the commitment.
Q

Yes, but there, just isn't any practical

possibility for a person charged with crime to get into
Muscatatuck.

Have you ever heard of one# a person who's been

committed for his inability to understand a criminal charge
and to stand trial of being transferred to Muscatatuck?
MR. BRESKOWs

No, I don't.

No, I haven't, Your.

Honor.
Q

Yes.

MR. BRESKOWs

The decision — I refer you to the

48
Appendix at page 26# of Judge Arteharn,

He says that ha

can be, though, Your Honor.
Q

Yes.

MS. BBESKOW%

He can be so transferred to

Muscatatuck,
Q

Yes.

MR. BRESKOW:

This 9“1706a non-comprehension

committee.
Q

Yes.

MR. BRESKOWs

Mow, we’ve already discussed, then,

Greenwood, Baxstrora, Weems, if you will, and Weems and Robinson
vs. California, the classic cruel and unusual punishment cases,
•would not preclude Indiana from taking alternative 3, the
commitment alternative, that it. does now.

Because, as was

pointed out by Mr. Justice Douglas, in the Robinson vs.
■California, in his concurring opinion, it is not the
confinement which amounts to cruel and unusual punishment,
it’s the confinement together with the conviction of a crime.
We don't have that in this situation.
•i*

In closing, let me submit to the Court that Indiana
treats procedurally all potential committees alike, whether
they be civil committees or criminal committees, as
designated by the petitioner,
. „

j

Procedurally alike, admittedly the criteria is
•different#

Bassstrom does not require that the criteria be

49
■the same.
For this Court to say bo would foe for this Court to
■establish a test for insanity, albeit non-comprahansion in
Indiana, different from 'the Indiana Legislature5.*3 definition
of insanity for purposes of non-comprehension,

and clasr-xcally

-the sovereign — the sovereignty of Indiana, the State
necessarily treats aid handles their insane the same as they
do with respect to other cases that are strictly the State's:
divorce, marriage, title to real estate, and insane,
tod the Indiana Legislature has adopted the noncomprehension test,

For this Court to sav there has to foe the

non™comprehension test plus something or, would be to
establish a different test,
Q

Well, that's — the non-comprehension test

was for not trying him.

It wasn't — I didn't know — isn't

there some case that says that if a fellow doesn't understand
the charges, he can he held forever?
MR. BSESKOW:

Only if there are charges pending

against him.
Q

Then he can be held forever, as long as the

charges are pending?
MR, BRESKOWs
Q

Has any court ever decided that?
No, no court has ever decided that.

Were it not for these two charges, ha would be

at Musca- — whatever it is.
MR. BRESKOW:

Your Honor, either way.

That doesn't

so
bear on his being able to go to Muscatatuek.

The charges#

that’s Judge Artebera's point.
Q

But my question was?

But for the two charges#

where would he be as between Central Hospital and Muscatatuek?
MR. BRESKOW:

I have to assume, 'four Honor# that

the Commissioner acted regularly, and he*«3 still be at Central
State# no matter —

Q

Feeble-mind?

MR. BRESKOW:
Q

Mo matter whether —

Feeble-minded person?

1 thought you said

feeble-minded didn1t go there,
MR, BRESKOW:
Q

Yes, sir.

And after -the Jackson —

But for the two charges, he would have been

found to be feeble-minded, and would have been at the civil
place.
MR. BRESKOW $

After the Jackson decision in this

case by the Indiana Court, he could have very well gone to
Central State.
Q

But you wouldn’t have had the Jactson decision

in this case if it weren’t for the charges.

Solely because

of these charges, he ends up in the hospital for the criminally
Insane.

Solely because of the charges.
MR. BRESKOWt

1 submit to you, Mr, Justice Marshall,

■that we’re not saying here that Jackson had to go to Central
-State because he was insane under 9-1706a, and than, therefore,

51
lie becomes feeble-minded under the other statute.
Q

To -the contrary he went there because criminal

charges were pending against him.
MR. BRESKOW;
Q

I don’t take that position.

Well, what if —

MR. BHBSKGW:

He was sent there because the Mental

Health Coaraaissionsr decided that was the best place for him.
Who had the alternative to send him to Muscatatuck.
Q

But that’s not what you just said.

You told me

that feeble-minded people didn’t go to Central — you said
that.
MR. BRESKOW:

I said 2 didn’t know of any ease where

a feeble-minded was sent to Muscatstuck, and when asked why,
2 said because that's — to Central State, because, historically,
Central State has been for more serious —
Q

Criminally insane,

MR. BRESKOW:
Q

Serious offenses.

Would they be criminally insane?

Is that a

good phrase?
MR. BRESKOW:

That isn’t necessary to have them go

to Central State.
Q

But it’s pretty accurate, isn’t it?

MR. BRESKOW:

We don’t make the distinction in

Indiana, Your Honor, between criminally insane and civilly
insane.

52
Q

Well, X think all my — my one question —*

I guess the facts will bear it out, that if he didn’t have
these two charges, if anything else had bean filed against
him, he would have ended up in civil?
MR* RRESKOWt

He wouldn*t.

That is net the case.

H© would not have been in Muscatatuck absent the charges*
He would have ended up where the Mental Health Commissioner
sent him, which may have well been Central State.
That discretion is with the Mental Health Commissioner.
And as Justice Artebem said in his opinion, that's
his expertise, not Jackson’s.
Thank you. Your Honor.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, Mr* Breakow,

Thank you, gentlemen.
The 4 case is submitted.
CMieraupon, at 2s46 p.ra., the case was submitted.)
