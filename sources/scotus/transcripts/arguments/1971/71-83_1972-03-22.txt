of Fee-oral Court jurisdiction,
Because the facts are so important,. I'd like to
elaborate a bit on them.

University.

graduating from law school, he returned to his
ccraa in Ban Francisco in order to take the California bar axes, •

ifh Army permission
And i . vras while he was at home, waiting to take the
bar qsc-v, that he had a series of personal events in his life-,

including suicide of a very close cousin, which caused him to
realise that he held beliefs of conscience that made it
impossible for him to fulfill his military obligation.
Accordingly, he requested that he be discharged from

the Army Reserva on grounds of conscientious objection.

And,

pursuant tc applicable Array Regulations, a series of interviews
and a hearing wore held at Fort Grd, California, a large Army
La .vi neat San F;;anciaco.
The results of those interviews and the hearing,

which were, favorable to Lieutenant Strait's claim, were forwarded
to ;.i board' of officers at the Army Reserve Components Personnel
Center in Indianapolis, Indiana, where the board concluded,
after reviewing the record, that Lieutenant Strait did not meet
th: criteria vT the regulations, and recommended against
granting the aiccharge.
He v -c

notified of that decision and -.informed that

MR, HANSBN;

Yes, that’s correct,

Ee:s the

f. that installation; that portion of

that installation.
■ihc.n he learned of the adverse decision, he immedi­
ately petitioned for review of that action in the.Federal
District Court in San Francisco,

She government moved to

dismiss on the grounds that the commanding officer at the
reserve center was not present in the district, and therefore
the court did not have jurisdiction.
That notion was denied, hut the court ultimately,
on the merits, denied relief to Lieutenant Strait.

Conse­

quently, he brought his appeal to the Court of Appeals for the
•T*

Ninth Circuit.
The Ninth Circuit initially affirmed the District
Court3s jurisdictional finding, but reversed it on the merits,
f iodine;

-

vesyy that Cere was no basis in fact in the

record to evpport the Army's denial of Lieutenant Strait's
request for discharge.

6
fchi

:

hie c

: .l-lr • yep

gov?£;r..y,nent petitioned the

1 lilSr and on that bn,-;:;./.

Court, of Appeal's for rehearing?

.:n:i that petition was granted;

the Court of Appeals,on the

authority of Bcrjiangsr, ordered the entire proceedings dis­
missed.
An--:!

is the decision that3r now before this

Court.

It jy.icoc a mia.bor of questions.

There are two

principal questions. The first is whether,, in order for a
L, le.ofc f.mfc he have habeas corpus jurisdiction, both the

petitioner and his custodian must be physically present in that
district.
The second question is whether habeas corpus is the
as’.y remedy available to a serviceman seeking to obtain

full:.dal review of a denial of the request for discharge.
That questicn, of cotrs-a, includes several aspects? but that
is the primary second issue.
Now, ,1th respect to the habeas corpus issue, this
Coart, in this context, is called upon to balance the greatness

of tho writ of habeas corpus, which lies in its prompt
avail iidliey,

ry-airst the territorial restriction which Congress

,'.•■3 .h. r.v;

ir.be district courts to grant writs of habeas

::.o.yner a roc tel colon that is included in the statute in the
he!.

s

lha district courts may grant writs of

7
’■ V: r

corpus within their respect:5. r jurisdictions *
...

nfcd

phrase means that both the petitioner and the custodian must
bo physically present, in the district, in order for the court
to grant the writ.
itrorocc petition contends that as long as he is
physically p:cooor.t in the district, it is only necessary that
ths custodian be present jurisdietionally, through contacts
that he has had with the petitioner in the district? and it is
not necessary, at least in this context and the limited
context that arises, that the custodian be physically present.
Now, to support this contention, we look first to
th

history of -the habeas corpus statute in this particular

phrase, which was inserted into the statutes, and it's remained
unchanged, in 1167,
The purpose of its insertion into the statute at

that time was to avoid a situation where petitioners in habeas
corpus proceedings night have to be transported around the
country.
Ironically, the government’s contention here is that
petitioner must do that vary thing, he must travel long
distantes across

this country before he can invoke the habeas

corpus jurisdiction of a district court.
Tie scabiem that, we have in this case with respect
:> this particular phrase, though, arises because there is a

s
class of

his count

.

", result cf the series of decisions of this- Court, which has
&%¥;;• xadod -tuv availability of the writ of habeas corpus to
inciuda persons who are not in actual physical confinement, are
not actually hall behind bars.

And this class of petitioners

may incised be in district and the custodian be in another.
1 situation that previously was highly unlikely to arise.
*

Now, this Court has interpreted this phrase in the
past, in the case of Ahrens v. Clark, and has there concluded
that the petitioner must indeed be physically present in the
district for the district court to have jurisdiction? and it
has not changed this ruling, apparentlyin view of the new
class of petitioners that exists.

But, of course, that

sraquiremQ.it is mat here.
But there is no question that if the custodian must
sbo physically present in the district that this will
greatly restrict the availability of the writ of habeas
corpus, certainly to the particular class of petitioners that
we have before the Court today.
It is our contention that this is contrary to the
nuyp-:se behind the phrase in the statute; it1 & contrary to the
purpose* of the Great Writ, and that it be promptly available.
1 ’ advances no policy interest of tbs government, the govern-

'•••cnfc benefits in no particular way from this rule; and it does
stantial hardships to the petitioner.

and then whilo

prison in Georgia.
:t would follow from your argument that the district,
in California would have jurisdiction?
MR. HJ.HSENt

Not necessarily, and there are a number

of reasone why that would be true.

First of all, as »e

pointed out in cur brief, the petitioner must always meet,
hit' nlf, the jvriscictional and venue requirements before he
ear invoke the j-irisdic-tioi; of the district court.

Although

he may be pi-ysiaally present, he may not be a resident of the
iirtrict, an--. therefore the district court may not have venue
over the action( or may find that there is a more convenient
forum where the action can be heard.

And then there is a second question as to whether
the custodian it that particular case that you mention is
jisribdictisnail- present in the district, because, from the

.

jcl'

i s'- tint you

t&rcsn would 1-district

'her-;

I don’t see any contacts that the

hat with t -tihioner while he was in the
’ a had been allowed to go.

Sven if he had had

10
a j.-c-is limina'.; contacts, troy cartainXy would not relate to the
c-.xjyi.ct matter of the action that, he brought,

Third... I think the coart might have come difficulty
carving yrc-vcv! - -* 15r. not ears: if you were calking about a
federal prisoner or a State prisoner — and that we must Icsep
in wind that that*s au important distinction that arises in
those cases, and makes the rule that we urge limited in its
i.-pplication,

Boeauce it really could arise only in situations

whore the prisoner is a ~~ where the issues are federal issues,

11

Q

'cell, let4s assume for the moment that he was

convicted in the same district court in California where his
family,, his principal residence, is located.

MR. H«EK:

Es would probably have jurisdicti ■

in that district court under Section 2255, and the question
would not arise.,

He was convicted in that district and he

was challenging his conviction„
How, if ho was challenging the conditions of his
custody in Georgia, then that would be a different question.
Bet there he would have to show that the warden in Georgia
had somehow entered the district, the Northern District of
California, in order to be subject to its jurisdiction.

And

it has never been — • 1 shouldn't say never? but for a long ti:v
this Court has held that it is not necessary for a person to h
physically present in a district to be subject to its
jurisdiction in other contacts.
And I see no reason, considering the purposes behind
the Great Writ, the policies to be served, including the fact
that the government is not injured here and the petitioner is
injured, why we cannot rely

upon the contacts theory in this

case.

would have been free to proceed- in Georgia?
MR. HANSEN:
Q

That’s correct.

Hell, what would the hardship of that instance

be?
Mil, bbv'SSN«
that aris4- from that.

Well, there are a masher c:c problems
Of course we’ve treated these extensively

in our brief, but 1*11 review them very briefly here.
The first is that in this case# where you have a
military reservist who has never been on active duty, it is
important to hin that he obtain a ruling before he has to go
on active duty.

That’s essentially the subject^matter of the
|

case 4
Q

Well, the draftee doesn’t have that# does h£?

Ml. MhttSBN:

But the draftee has not yet exhausted

S(0:.:ohI;“. 6liheegh Lieutenant Strait would go to

Moreover,

in addition to which there is the time involved hors*
traveling back *md forth across country in order to litigate
eases.
All tho administrative procedures took place here
in San Francisco, and that’s also where local counsel are most
familiar with the cate.

lt*s not easy to litigate these

scatters in federal court if you have to start afresh In a
place that.Js thousands of miles from your home and counsel.
These are not, as the government seems to indicate, minor
problems.

They would probably bs insurmountable problems to

a certain number of people.
That’s the problems that wa sea with that suggestion
c-n the part of rho government.

Again.. oaphasiring, as the Second Circuit did in the
■

-a of

v .

which is cited in our brief, it is in

CAreet conflict with the Ninth Circuit decision here, and

**

JL%

rcutly -e.,u..v ■ a >;

in v.hc r ,

The -Iric:::ud Circuit said it's illogical that a man

to force bin to go on active duty.

It#s sort of putting, the

.cart before the horse.
That*a what the petitioner wants and why h© wants
prompt review» ho doesn't want to have to go on active dutyy
as the matter* we discuss in our brief indicate.
The Court» of course» must reconcile this case with
its decision lent term in Sehlanger v.. Seamans» and wa feel
that it io possible to decide this case in favor of the
petitioner without, doing violence to Seh1angar.

Isn't that right?

MR. HANSEN:

He had been on active duty for several

years» and —

Q

Ha was on leave and was on his way back to

Georgia; isn't that right?
MR. HANSEN$

1 believe — yes; he filed his

petition in the district of Arizona something like the day

before hr was ussposed to b© back in Georgia.

IS
£\iiC

St:--ait has never been in Indiana in his

.'■i£e, .is that right?
I'iv'i,. E,VESEVI s

Well, X can't a ay that he’s never

passed through, flown over, it in an airplane? but that's, true*
It®8s never bean in Indiana for any military purpose.
Georgia.

Or in

Or in .any other State, really, for any military

purpose, except if you count his attendance at Yale Lav
School? but for military purpose.
But fie cases are distinguishable.

First, the point*.t

that Mr. Justice Marshall has made, there's quite a difference
between the status of the two petitioners at the time they
brought the action.

In fact, there’s some question as to

whether Sergeant Sehlanger could even be said to have been a
resident of Arizona? he was only there on a vary temporary
he maintained a permanent residence elsewhere.

He had

been a member of an active military unit in Georgia for several
months, where he had an actual commanding officer.

And that

commanding officer, moreover, unlike Lieutenant Strait’s
commanding officer, really had very little to do with him while
he was in Arizona.
That was not. the commanding officer that was his
commanding officer when the subject matter of his suit arose,
tV v.t had occurred son© year or more before.

Es had been under

a different command at that time.
d therefore hie current commanding officer, the

16
c"

cf the -.■.it is. Georgia where he had performed

functions for a nine-month period , had really no contact with
him in Arizona*
That *« more analogous to the situation that the Chief
Oiw.-tice previously posed*

He had been allowed temporarily to

go there for purposes totally unrelated to that action that
he was bringing at that time.
But wore importantly? I think? and the overriding
question in this case? is that where you have this new class
of o.nominally restrained, if at all? really? petitioners
who are

a very highly technical form of custody? it's not

u.

necessary for the court to have that close a contact with the
custodian? because there's no turnkey in this case.

The court

does not send a writ down to the jail? the jailer looks at if
and then turns a key and lets the man out of the jail.

In these cases all you need is some kind of a
judicial determination that then becomes res judicata with
respect to this man's status.
Q

Sir. Hansen, why wouldn't it be equally logical?

in viev? of this new class of? as you say, technically
restrained, if at all? for this Court to simply say that
he

as corpus won’t lie until -the restraint becomes more than

technical?
MR.

s

Because

1

think the Court answered that

qu.y.\i:'..-.n only 2:.at term, or last month? excuse me, in the

1?

Isi

■

t

virtu/? of bi.v restraint as a member of the military# is
«entitled to o:.or: ; judicial review in habeas corpus•

And there

are a number of circuit cases that have found that a reservist
is in custody and restrained for that purpose.
After all# he can he subjected to an order of the
military at any moment in time,

And the question# 1 think,

has already been answered by this Court# that these new

petitioners are in custody for habeas corpus jurisdiction.
The question in this case is where are they in custody,
X would like to turn to some of .the alternative
remedies that we urge are available at this time# however#
in answer to your question# and also because# of course# we1 re
pushing them quite strongly in this case.
In addition to pleading habeas corpus jurisdiction
in the district court# Lieutenant Strait urged that the
district court had jurisdiction under the Federal Mandamus
statute# in Title 20# Section 1361; the Federal Question
statute# in Title 28, Section 1331(a)?

the judicial review

KM. CEXBF JU&3XCS BURGER:

Mr, Hansen, you may

proceed,
ill, HHISEH:

Mo. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court againt
1 was about to big discussing our alternate theories
to jurisdiction other than habeas corpus.

I'd like to first

speak about the Federal Mandamus section, Title 28, Section
.1351, which was passed by Congress to alleviate a problem very
similar to that here.

The problem where parsons who sought

to challenge federal administrative action© would have to
travel across the country in order to do so.
The government contends, however, that Section 1361
is not available: here, because the decision under review is
discretionary.

That, of course, merely begs the question*

Ob: question ir. ;• that is a discretionary decision?

And it is

or-,: sorvtantion that an officer of the federal government does
.v,ot have discretion to fail to follow his own regulations and
to render an. administrative decision contrary to those regulations.

And that the discretion referred to is that

discretion contained in. decisions of a policy-making or
political nature, not the kind of operational decision that is
present here.
Mow, it' :i true that the agency here has- to make some

19

Tfc-fi-mng

perhaps apply those facts to the law.

And

■

•"■ - T-t a 1111 t: till

that «

tor rovi.:-as Chief

Justice Ta£t told us in the case of Work v„ Rives over 50 years
&.gos

that; although the officer's duty may be discretionary

Vitkin limits, to aanlt'

transgress those limits, and if he

atos bo, he may be controlled by mandamus•
Or, to out it another way,, as this Court more
recently said in the Panama Canal case in 1959, cited by the
the .respondents?

A decision which cannot be reached is one

which is so wide open in that launch as to be left entirely
to agency discretion.
And this decision is not wide open.

There is a

substantial law of conscientious objection that is to be
applied here.
Now, the findings and conclusions of the Review Board
•..'.r.iost on their face violate the law and the regulations.
In fact, the government conceded below error in those con.lesions in all respects except one, and that was the conclu­
sion that Lieutenant Strait was insincere.
But The Amy had found a wide variety of failure to
moat the regulatory criteria which are under the decisions of
this Court recently in Welsh vUnited States, Clay v. United
States t clearly erroneous.
Ac.d men with respect to the sincerity question,

20

law 1

applied,

A conclusion that a parson is

in \L. .cere on a conscientious objector claim must be based on
facts in the record.

Moreover, those facts must be objective

and rational, tc reach that conclusion.

and it was the unanimous opinion of the three-judge
Court of Appeals that there were, no such facts in this record;
that the decision was without a basis in fact, in addition to
being legally erroneous.
So, accordingly, it's quite clear in this ease that
the Army failed to follow the law, found in its own Peguiation.
and interpretative judicial decisions.

It can hardly be denied

that Lieutenant Strait is entitled to have his claim reviewed
according to the law, and that the federal agents in this case
had a duty, perhaps a clear duty, one of a ministerial nature,
to base their decision on the law, and according to the facts
in the record.
The government falls back from that position, then,
and argues that, well, in any event, Section 1361 can’t be
utilised because there’s another remedy, habeas corpus, which
can be invoked in Indiana or Georgia.
We have analysed the cases where that approach has
t

been taken to mandamus jurisdiction and have found that where
that has been dorJe, it has been done only where the other
.v, v:j>dy is. on:.: ’
c.hv.; ic created by statute and is the exclusive
y .:.zic&y for the particular aggrieved action.

's’
&l nb>

Moreover, the courts have always referred to the other

sate remedy, and of course, as our d
under habeas corpus, pointed outf there's serious question as

to whether habeas corpus in a distant State is an adequate
remedy.
There is even some question whether, in this case, at
the time that Lieutenant Strait filed this petition, if we
are to accept the government’s contentions, that it was even
available at that tire, for they contend that Lieutenant
Strait had to perform certain conditions precedent before
habeas corpus jurisdiction even existed.
Korocvar, their•suggestion defeats the very purposes
behind Section 1361, because their result requires petitioner
to travel to a distant State rather than to be able to bring the
action where he resides, which is what Congress hoped to
provide for in Section 1361.
In addition, wo pleaded jurisdiction under the
Administrative Procedure Act, which we feel does confer
independent jurisdiction on this Court, on the district
courts, and that this Court’s decision last term in the
Overton Park v, Volpe case so held.
igale the discretionary jurisdiction question comes
up, and I third that our answer under mandamus applies as
well *
Finally, with respect to Section 1331, the question

22

remaining question„
is t ■ ■

'

.

the ,'iiv .0^0 jurisidotional amount; and we

feel that a cj: cim of agency action that violates due process of
law, par se, Kenta the $10,000 jurisdictional amount in
question.
So vlat we are asking this Court to do today is to

approach, this ease realistically, according to the facts,
policies underlying these decisions, and not to needlessly
restrict prompt judicial review after the Army has denied a
request for discharge on conscientious objection„
X ■

like at this time, if I may, to reserve the

remaining minutes for rebuttal.

that historically the writ of habeas corpus was based on
territorial considerations, and that has been particularly true
in its history in the United States, where the form of the
v irvr.c is e- , : directed to a person who is required to produce
the person of the.applicant.
After all, it is "ha-b©~as corpus”, in the second
parson;

"you have the body".

And the whole force of the

writ is that it is directed against somebody who is the
►

custodian of the person who is in custody.
We recognise that the Great Writ has been expanded
&:.ju£ extended in decisions of the Court.

We find it somewhat

difficult to think that it should be so attenuated and so
diluted that the basic purpose of the writ becomes forgotten,
i world hope wo would net come to the place, where we talk about
a remedy and say it finds its origin in the writ of habeas
corpus, which was very important in the early days.

It seems

to s>.2 that the Great Writ should be retained with its tradi.l :.:. 1 limitations, in sc far as that remains appropriate, and

eo • •. ■ ;

b; is required by the statute enacted by Congress.

24
1 knovr that Minton said that "the forms of action
rule-; h from the grave”, but, nevertheless, our position is
fch, t the 'writ of habeas corpus is not merely a device for
righting a wrong.
For example, as I sat here on Monday listening to the
argument in the Flood case, and thinking about the argument
today, 1 found myself wondering 'whether the Flood case could
not have boon presented to this Court as a habeas corpus
case.

There you had a person in custody, because obviously

his freedom was restrained, he could not play baseball any
place in the United States, Mexico, or Japan? you had a
custodian.
I should think i?t would

be

highly undesirable to

approach that case in terms of habeas corpus, and I think it is
equally•undesirable here in the absence of action by Congress
to eliminate by judicial action the requirement in the
statute that thure be a custodian within the territorial
jurisdiction of the court.
This may seem technical, but our concern is, in part,
the question of forum shopping.

It's perfectly true that

Lieutenant Strait is a long-time resident of the Northern
District of California, but the Northern District of California
is statistically a good place for seeking discharge on the
grounds of conscientious objection, and it can be understand­
able why he would prefer to sue there rather than in some other

c

25
jurisdiction„
\:hi.

on pages ■ .1 and

itself f as I have said, which is quoted
of our brief, provides:

order fc slew c

"The writ, or

oh :•!! be directed to the person having

custody of the person detained."
And then if proceeds, further down on the pages
“The person to whom the writ is directed shall be
required to produce at the hearing the body of the person
detained,*
As we read the statute and understand the case, the
issue before the Court is squarely and directly covered by
this Court's decision in Sch

vr v, Seamans, which was

announced just a. year ago tomorrow, March 23rd, 1971,

where

the Court denied Sergeant Sch1anger3 s effort to get habeas
*

corpus through

court in Arizona by saying that, the district

coorfc in Arizona h-. :

o custodian within its reach, against

whom this writ, can run.
The officer in Georgia is an officer of the United
States,

E© could be served outside the jurisdiction under

Section 1391(a), just as much as the:Colonel in Indianapolis
can be served here, but the Court decided just a year ago that
the court in Arisen® has no custodian within its reach against
whom this writ m run, and then continued:

“the absence of

his custodian is fatal to the jurisdiction of the Arizona
court «

26

Incidentally .*

may say that Sergeant Schlanger is

now out of the Mr Force and has been in touch with me about
getting admitted to a law school»
The decision which is in conflict with the present
r >u58s is the decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals
in &rlen v. Laird. We think that the basis of the conflict is
rather patently on the face of the opinion due to a misunder­
standing.

The Court said?

on this precise question.

The Supreme Court reserved decide,:
But I think if the opinions are

examined, it is apparent that the issue which was reserved
was whether the special type of reservist in this situation,
who-

is not assigned to any unit, is win custody".
That war; what was .really involved in the Donigian

case, and that is the issue which is conceded here.

The

question is whether the custodian is within the jurisdiction
of the court, and whether that is required? and our position is
that that is exactly the issue which was cased in Schianger,
end exactly the issue which the Court decided in, what seemed
to us to he, unequivocal terms.
Now, here there are what seem to me to be reasonable
v.Xfceriiativss for Lieutenant Strait.

sated, his transporta-

-.vili ba paid and ha err-, than iromsdiately

bile a petition for habeas corpus.
There is a suggestion that there's a terrible burden,,
-very brief distinction between his being in the ; inactive
reserve and his being on active duty; the fact is, however,
t xat he is in the Army now and has been in the Amy for a number
ff ye are, an 3 ho can raise in the Georgia courts, in complete*ne3s, all the questions which he seeks to raise.
However, if it is really important for him that he
not go on active duty, and I repeat I find it difficult to
why it is really is important, I can understand why some
hirdo of conscientious objectors might say, al cannot be in .the
.'.ray at all, and therefore 1 cannot take the alternative off
accepting induction and than applying for habeas corpus"; but
Lieutenant Strait is in the Army and has been in the Array four
years.
But if it is important to him that he not have to
be in the Army oh an active-duty status, he can sue in — it
•&a Indiana,- it is now Missouri.

The suggestion is made that

this will swamp the courts in that State because there are,
ft is «avi» r

million reservists; the overwhelming propor-

t'l :-n of those, however, ere men who have completed their
rdlitary service, who' are subject to call only in the event of

:/±v. greatest :»\ationai emergency end, as stated in our brief,

are only 13,000 altogether
in the Array daring the year 1971, they produced a total of 84
conscientious objector claims, of which 39 were decided
adversely, which seems to be the total pool from which the
potential number of habeas corpus cases of this kind can be
drawn on an annual basis.
With respect to his suing in Georgia, I think it can.
appropriately be pointed out that he entered the Army
voluntarily*

It io said that it is a hardship to him to have

to sue in Georgia? but hardship is a relative matter*

He

has obtained many years of draft exemption by being in the
BQ'-SC and then having it extended for law school education.
If he had been drafted and found to be a conscientious
objector, he would have had two years of alternative service.
I assume that he is now over 26 years old, and that that risk
would not bo applicable.
And so on the road which he has followed, he has
had the hist of both ways? he*s had benefits from military
,service, but ha would not have to perform on activa duty or
the alternative service, which a conscientious objector
ordinarily has to perform.
With respect to habeas corpus, we think the sole
issue :-.s the question with respect to the presence of the
sustodian with in the jurisdiction of the courts and that that

29

by this Court's decision in the
Schlangsr case.
Mew, it is suggested that the petition in the
District Court in this case was very broadly drawn, and presents
numerous other bases of jurisdiction, other than that of habeo;.;
corpus.

For example, the Administrative Procedure Act is

advanced.
But there, it seems to me that the Act itself contain:
the an

to its applicability, quite apart from other question^

The Act is quoted on page 39 of our brief.

It's Title 5 United

States Code, Section. 704, and it begisis:
"Agency action made reviewable by statute and final
agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a
court." — and here wo submit that there is a clear and adequate
remedy in the court, now in Missouri, or in the court in
Georgia after Lieutenant Strait responds to his orders to
report for active duty.
life would further submit that the Administrative
J■

Procedure Act is not itself a basis fof federal court
jurisdiction.

X toyed with that thought myself, or thought

seriously about it in connection with the preparation of this
case, but it is, I am sure, a Pandora's boss.

If the Court

starts down that road, than any serviceman who is ordered
transferred from Fort Meade, Maryland, to some place in
Texas, can present the question to the court whether that

30
transfer v;as$ proper,

;ny serviceman who is ordered to undergo

training to become an auto mechanic could equally raise the
sane issue in court, and that, it seems to me, quite clearly

Procedure Act.
With respect to a suit for a declaratory judgment,
the jurisdictional basis in the court would be Section 1331(a):,
Share is there a $10,000 jurisdictional amount.

1 know that

the courts have not bean very happy about that., and have found
ways to decide cases without dealing with that.

But, after all,

that is the jurisdictional limitation which Congress put into
the statute.

It seems to me that it should not be simply

overlooked or ignored.
Here habeas corpus is available, it is the appropriate
remedy, and it should be the exclusive remedy.
And finally, it is contended on behalf of Lieutenant
Strait, that the mandamus would be a remedy.

Mandamus to do

what isn't entirely clear to me, or who should do what.

The

Colonel at Port Benjamin Harrison is the only officer of the
Army who has issued an order to Lieutenant Strait, and,
incidentally, we have tendered as the final appendix of

cur brief the Army Regulation which deals with the persons
in the inactive reserve, and which provides explicitly that
the officer in command of the &as&rv® Officer Personnel Center
snoalci hi the officer in command of these people.

They in ay have decided it wrong, but it is not

tee funvMoe of murid ?taa.s to review and revise decisions which
people have made in performance of their duties.
That, was precisely the decision of this Court in the

case of Miguel v. McCarl, in 291 U.s. 442, wh*»re the chief of
finance of the Army had sought an advance ruling from the
Controller General, and the Comptroller General had made that
ruling .

Mandamus was then sought against the Comptroller

General,

■■•■id the Court decided that mandamus would not lie,

because the Comptroller General’s duty was to rule, and he had
ruled.
The Court also decided that mandamus could lie

against the Chief of Finance of the Army because they concluded
that the ruling was wrong end that the Chief of Finance of
the Array was not justified in complying with the Comptroller
General!s decision.
With respect to the justiciability of an issue like

this in mandamus, it seems to me that this Court's decision
yesterday in the Fine case is highly relevant.

That of course

case? that was a question whether there

the Cc-}3ter-|iph end Breen and Gufcn-scht cases on the one side,
and Clark v»__Gabriel and now the Fine case, and the Sblert case
on the other»
But the line.? it seems to me, is the same as the
line involved with respect to the applicability of mandamus?
that is, where there is a controversial issue of fact which
needs to be decided.
But in the Fine case, as in Clark v* .Gabriel,
involving conscientious objection, it was held that that was
such an issue, that it was not appropriate to disregard Section
10(b)(3), and I should think that by a parallel line of argument
it was such an issue as should not be held to be a basis for
that summary order to do a clear duty? which is the underlying
basis for the grant of a writ of mandamus.
And for these reasons, we submit that the decision
of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit should be
affirmed.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Solicitor
General.
Mr. Hansen, you have about four minutes left.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN T. HANSEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
Rk. HANSEN;

Thank you.

I would like to reply to

..at the Solicitor General raised

33
to the custodian bringing the body
before the court.,- 1 find this to be a very strange requirement,
to be elevated in this case to prat.
jurisdictionc where the petitioner is already in the jurisdictio-/;
of the district court and the custodian here has for years
been ordering him around and producing his foody by orders
communicated to him by snail in this very same district.
1' don t see how it. would help the government to have
the custodian now physically present in the district.
Moreover, under one of their suggestions, that .ha go
to Indiana for a scintilla of time, establish jurisdiction there
and than apparently go back home to San Francisco, we'd have
the same problem*
This Court has long recognised that: it is not
necessary that the custodian be physically able to produce the
body because he’s in the district.

X think the Bndo case says

that when the petitioner has left the district and he’s in
custody, actual physical custody, of some other person, a
custodian can still, by long distance, produce the result
desired.

And that is what we urge hers.
X regret that the Solicitor General has raised the

question of fornm shopping in this case for the first time,
at this level.

It has never been raised before.

been a hint of i.t in this case.

There's never

And the government has never

suggested that .his case could he more better brought in another

34
clistr.i..jt, for arty reason relating to forum shopping..
The Second Circuit, in the Arien case, rather

t

mar: lv disposed oi’ that -suggestion and found it somewhat

frivolous that the government had. any interest in having
these cases tried in the district other than that where the
petitioner is residing.

There just was.no forum shopping here,

and if forum shopping arises in these cases in the future,
they can be controlled by venue and forum non conveniens
rulings, not by artificial, jurisdictional rulings.

Likewise, tha suggestion that Lieutenant Strait
enjoys scEa kind of draft exemption because of having accepted
an RGTC commission was raised and rejected by the Court of
Appeals.

Had Lieutenant Strait not gone through ROTC, not

accepted this commission, he would have been exempt from the
draft just the same, with the 2~S deferments through college
and law school, and that he would have been entitled to.

As to the APA on its face, eliminating jurisdiction
where there’s another remedy, the Solicitor General did not
mention this Court’s decision of Brownell v. We Shung In 19 is
whr-sre the Court permitted an immigrant to use the APA in
declaratory relief, even though he could have submitted himselr
to custody and brought habeas corpus.

They held that either

remedy was available.
T

also find, some inconsistency in the suggestion that

“he A;?A in not a jurisdictional statute, and yet also arguing

that if jurisdiction independently exists, the Court should not

Is not

i? i.punient jooitdxr:i;:Lon;:-.i grout, then there would always or
erect’ and nover any need to use APA,
T don‘t soo any problem, either, of the Court having
to reach the kinds of issues suggested by the Solicitor
General with respect to

servicemen wanting to challenge their

duty assignments or the type of training they’re getting.
'Those are, indeed, policy decisions of the Array that do not
necessarily relate to facts that have been found in
...crain 1 strative proceedings that have been held, and there may
be, indeed, in those areas, complete discretion.

And this

Court has long held that the courts do not control assignments
of servicemen to specific duty assignments, but has repeatedly
affirmed the right to a man claiming that he’s illegally held
it? the Army, to challenge the Army’s right to continue to hold
him.
That is what is asked here.

The court in mandamus

could issue an order in combination with the declaratory
j vdement action,
