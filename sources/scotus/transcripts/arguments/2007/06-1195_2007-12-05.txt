ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH W. WAXMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Petitioners in these cases have three

12

things in common.

13

Guantanamo for almost six years, yet not one has ever

14

had meaningful notice of the factual grounds of

15

detention or a fair opportunity to dispute those grounds

16

before a neutral decision-maker.

17
18

First, all have been confined at

Two, under the decision below, they have no
prospect of getting that opportunity.

19

And three, each maintains, as this Court

20

explained in Rasul, that he is quote "innocent of all

21

wrongdoing."

22

are detainable, and the facts of these 37 cases differ,

23

and it may well that be that an adjudicatory process

24

that preserves the core features of common law habeas

25

would reveal perhaps that some of these Petitioners are

Now the government contends that these men

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

lawfully detainable.

2

structurally flawed CSRT process cannot provide any

3

reliable examination of the Executive's asserted basis

4

for detaining these Petitioners, let alone an adequate

5

substitute for traditional habeas review.

6

But limited DTA review of the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought that we

7

ruled in the Hamdi case that procedures quite similar to

8

those under the DTA were adequate for American citizens?

9

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, with respect, Mr. Chief

10

Justice, what you ruled -- as I understand what the

11

plurality held in Hamdi was that so long as there was a

12

process accompanying detention, that provided for

13

meaningful notice of the factual grounds for detention,

14

a meaningful opportunity to present evidence in response

15

to that before a neutral tribunal with the assistance of

16

counsel, that determination would certainly be entitled

17

to substantial deference by a habeas court; and we don't

18

dispute that.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

MR. WAXMAN:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that --

That's not what they got.
So our judgment in

22

this case depends upon whether we agree with you or the

23

government that the procedures available under the DTA

24

are meaningful under Hamdi?

25

MR. WAXMAN:

It -- I think your decision in
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this case, the question -- the principal question we

2

think is presented by the case is whether or not the DTA

3

review of the CSRT procedures that occurred in this case

4

adequately substitute for the writ of habeas corpus.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Waxman, how could

6

that be, because the D.C. Circuit never got to that

7

question?

8

that there was no access to habeas, end of case.

9
10

The D.C. Circuit, as I understand it, ruled

So the D.C. Circuit never examined the
procedure under the DTA, did it?

11

MR. WAXMAN:

No.

The district court -- the

12

two district judges sitting in habeas went to the merits

13

of the case, and Judge Green did evaluate the

14

procedures.

15

Constitution, neither the Suspension Clause nor the Due

16

Process Clause, applies to these people.

17

it didn't reach the merits.

18

The D.C. Circuit held that the

And therefore

But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So shouldn't we, if we

19

agree with you, that there is authority in the

20

D.C. Circuit, send it back to them to make that

21

determination whether habeas being required, this is an

22

adequate substitute.

23

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I'm not saying that this

24

Court couldn't do that.

25

But one of the principal -- the principal guarantee of

It certainly could do that.

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

habeas corpus through the centuries has been a speedy --

2

the remedy of speedy release for somebody who is

3

unlawfully being held in executive detention.

4

These 37 men have been held in isolation for

5

6 years, and it is manifest on the record in this case.

6

There's no doubt about how the CSRT has proceeded.

7

There is little doubt about the circumscribed nature of

8

the D.C. Circuit's review.

9

held that the Constitution doesn't apply.

10

The D.C. Circuit has already

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your argument

11

wouldn't be any different with respect to the

12

availability of habeas if these people were held for one

13

day, would it?

14

in deciding whether habeas is available, do we?

15

We don't look at the length of detention

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I want to give a

16

qualified disagreement with your hypothetical, because

17

it's entirely clear that, as I think members of this

18

Court have indicated and that habeas traditionally

19

indicates, there may be military exigencies, there may

20

be a limited time period in which it is inappropriate

21

for a habeas court to rule.

22

And moreover -- if there --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, let me just

23

stop you there.

Do you want this Court to rule on

24

whether or not there are military exigencies that

25

require the holding and detention of these enemy
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

combatants?

2

MR. WAXMAN:

No, what I was referring to

3

were sort of the hypothetical of battlefield -- somebody

4

is captured -- you know -- and the next day or the next

5

week from the battlefield, does he or she have the right

6

to -- does a habeas court have constitutional

7

jurisdiction.

Putting aside-

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Putting aside the

9

battlefield hypothetical, we're talking about

10

Guantanamo.

11

in Guantanamo has the right to habeas.

12

detention is irrelevant to your assertion.

13

Your argument is that somebody held one day

MR. WAXMAN:

So the extent of

I don't think so, with respect.

14

I think -- I don't think -- I think it is appropriate

15

for a habeas -- if the Executive says we have detained

16

this person, we believe this person is an enemy

17

combatant who may be lawfully detained under the AUMF,

18

we have an administrative process that is fair, that

19

will -- that will determine the facts.

20

your hand to allow that procedure to occur.

21

that is appropriate, so long as the procedure is

22

meaningful and speedy.

23

cases.

24
25

You should stay
Of course,

That's what we do in immigration

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But your basic position

has to rest on Guantanamo Bay being just like if we had
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the detainees in, say, the Everglades.

2

concede that if these people had never been brought to

3

the United States, if the facility were in, say,

4

Germany, that these detainees would have no access to

5

habeas, no access to our courts?

6

MR. WAXMAN:

But do you

I wouldn't agree with that for

7

two reasons.

First of all, I think these people are in

8

a place that is even -- that is under even more complete

9

control and jurisdiction of our national Executive than

10

they would be in the Everglades, because there are no

11

Federalism constraints here.

12

supplies the only law.

13

Our national government

And if they were detained in Germany, the

14

question would be A, are they being detained by the

15

United States or by some multinational coalition force

16

as was the case, for example, in Hirota.

17

B, are there other laws, or can they invoke

18

the jurisdiction of another court?

19

that question would depend upon the terms of our --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the answer to

Who says that -- let's

21

consider first the basis on which the court of appeals

22

decided this case.

23

They decided it -- in Rasul, we had held

24

that the habeas statute extended to Guantanamo, and that

25

those people who had filed their suits before the
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute, at least, could bring a suit.

2

Congress acted.

And enacted a new habeas

3

statute which makes it very clear that the habeas

4

statute, at least, does not apply to these people in

5

Guantanamo.

6

Your assertion here is that there is a

7

common law constitutional right of habeas corpus that

8

does not depend upon any statute.

9

Do you have a single case in the 220 years

10

of our country or, for that matter, in the five

11

centuries of the English empire in which habeas was

12

granted to an alien in a territory that was not under

13

the sovereign control of either the United States or

14

England.

15
16

MR. WAXMAN:

The answer to that is a

resounding yes.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. WAXMAN:

What is -- what are they?

They are the cases that were

19

discussed and cited by the majority opinion in Rasul,

20

and we have -- we have added other ones to them, but

21

it's showing --

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What cases -- what case in

particular do you think in Rasul?
MR. WAXMAN:

I think the opinion of two of

the three law lords in the Earl of Crewe, which the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

majority cited as In re Sekgome.

2

government concedes it was the case in Mwenya.

3

true in the Indian cases.

4

--

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

Mwenya involved an English

-- an English subject, not an alien.
MR. WAXMAN:

10

It was

And, in fact, as we point out

7

9

It is certain -- the

Indeed, it did.
The question there is an

alien.
MR. WAXMAN:

Indeed, it did, and the

government --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. WAXMAN:

So it's totally irrelevant.

Well, no -- let me take a shot

14

at convincing you that it's not totally irrelevant.

The

15

Crown Counsel in that case, in his brief, stated

16

forthrightly that subjecthood or citizenship didn't

17

matter and, in fact, in the very minority opinion that

18

the government relies on in its brief here in Earl of

19

Crewe, Lord Justice Kennedy specifically said that the

20

citizenship is irrelevant.

It isn't and wasn't --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In both of those cases, it

22

was a citizen, nonetheless.

23

history, or five centuries of the -- do you have a

24

single case in which it was not a citizen of England or

25

a citizen of the United States in which a common-law

In 220 years of our

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

writ of habeas corpus issued to a piece of land that was

2

not within the sovereign jurisdiction?

3

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, the Court majority in

4

Rasul cites a case involving the Isle of Jersey, the

5

Channel Islands.

6

sovereign courts'

7

None of those were within the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They were not regarded as

8

part of the crown's dominion, but they were part of the

9

crown's sovereign territory.

MR. WAXMAN:

I'll take one more chance,

Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay, try them.

I mean,

line them up.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

Here they go.

In the

16

Indian cases -- I mean, first of all, let's say that

17

citizenship was not a notion at common law.

18

question was subjecthood, and subjecthood was a very

19

ill-defined term that had no fixed parameters, as our

20

reply brief points out.

21

The

Certainly many of the petitioners in the

22

Indian cases that we cited -- and in fact that Sir John

23

Chambers decided -- were not Englishmen or people who

24

would have been otherwise considered --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the cases were decided

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

under a statute that applied in India, not under --

2

under the common law.

3

And the writ did not come from England; the

4

writ came from English courts in India under a statute.

5

And we decided that in Rasul.

6

that in Rasul, that's fine.

7

common law right that somehow found its way into our

8

constitution without, as far as I can discern, a single

9

case in which the writ ever to a non-citizen.

MR. WAXMAN:

I mean, you want to do
But you are appealing to a

Justice Scalia, as Lord

11

Mansfield explained in the King v. Cowle, and both sides

12

are citing to it -- even if the writ -- even with

13

respect to the persons detained outside the English

14

realm, the relevant question was, is this person under

15

the subjection of the crown?

16

subjecthood or citizenship of this person?

17

--

18

Not what is the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And in fact

What is the

19

relevance to your -- this line of reasoning to the

20

recent enactment by Congress of section 1005(g), which

21

says that the base at Guantanamo is not part of the

22

United States?

23

branches that we don't exercise sovereignty over the

24

leasehold, and it seems to me that, if we're going to

25

adhere to our habeas corpus cases, we would have to

There is a judgment by the political

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reject that determination.

2

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, let me

3

answer that question directly and then if I may finish

4

my answer to Justice Scalia.

5

We don't contend that the United States

6

exercises sovereignty over Guantanamo Bay.

Our

7

contention is that at common law, sovereignty (a) wasn't

8

the test, as Lord Mansfield explained, and (b) wasn't a

9

clear-cut determine -- there weren't clear-cut

10

sovereignty lines in those days.

11

depend on sovereignty.

12

among other things, the United States exercises --

13

quote -- "complete jurisdiction and control over this

14

base."

It depends on the fact that,

No other law applies.

15
16

Our case doesn't

If our law doesn't apply, it is a law-free
zone.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

So the answer to

18

Justice Ginsburg's question, it wouldn't matter where

19

these detainees were held so long as they are under U.S.

20

control.

21

pursuant to a standard treaty with another country, if

22

they were in Afghanistan or in Iraq, the result would be

23

the same?

24
25

If they were held on a U.S. military base

MR. WAXMAN:

No, I think, Justice Alito, I

want to be as clear about this as I can be.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

This is a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

particularly easy straightforward case, but in another

2

place, jurisdiction would depend on the facts and

3

circumstances, including the nature of an agreement with

4

the resident sovereign over who exercises control.

5

I want to come back to that with the Japan and German

6

example, because I have read the status of forces

7

agreements there.

8
9

And

Secondly, even if there technically were
jurisdiction, there might very well be justiciability

10

issues under the circumstances of the sort that

11

Justice Kennedy addressed in his concurrence in Rasul;

12

that is, there may be circumstances and temporal

13

conditions in which, under the separation of powers, it

14

would be a -- a court would deem it inappropriate to

15

exercise that jurisdiction.

16

And finally, even if it were appropriate to

17

exercise the jurisdiction, the review of a habeas court

18

in the mine run of cases would be anything but plenary

19

because members of enemy armed forces and enemy aliens

20

within the meaning of the Alien Enemy Act are

21

detainable.

22

Period.

Now, with respect to --

Well, if they were in the

9

material is that -- I mean we cited to the Court the

10

Army directives and the Army procedures implementing

Now, once a determination like that is made,

adjudication of that tribunal.

facts, a fair opportunity to challenge them with the

2

assistance of counsel before a neutral decisionmaker.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So to determine

4

whether there's jurisdiction, in every case we have to

5

go through a multi factor analysis to determine if the

6

United States exercises not sovereignty, which you've

7

rejected as the touchstone, but sufficient control over

8

a particular military base?

9

World War II, in Vietnam, and it is going to decide in

10

some cases whether the control is sufficient and others

11

whether it isn't?

Over the Philippines during

12

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I don't --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that is a

14

judgment we the Court would make, not the political

15

branches who have to deal with the competing

16

sovereignties in those situations?

17

MR. WAXMAN:

You know, I think -- both sides

18

try to derive force from the fact that such claims, such

19

habeas petitions, haven't come forward in floods in the

20

past.

21

I think the reason is that, in the past, we

22

had combat in which -- you know -- I mean in a war of

23

the conventional sort, soldiers wear uniforms, and more

24

to the point, the interests of the captured soldier and

25

the command -- and the capturing officer are aligned.

The captured soldier wants to be treated as a prisoner

there were 1200 -- roughly, just a few hundred, 1200

3

would be like Mr. Ludekey in the United States v.

personally reviewed the evidence and determined that

simply dismiss.

In our case in Rasul, both the concurring

opinion and the majority opinion say things like the

reach of the writ depends not on formal notions of

territorial sovereignty, but on the practical questions.

Now suppose we take that as the definition.

Now, can you find instances where the writ has been

issued by Britain in history to people who were not

Yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Waxman, this

determination, whether it's sovereignty or subjugation

have diplomatic consequences.

an act of war for one country to assert authority and

control over another country's jurisdiction.

8
9

It is, I think, typically

And here we have Section 1005G where
Congress and the President have agreed that Guantanamo

10

Bay is not part of the United States, and, yet, you

11

would have this Court issue a ruling saying that it is

12

subject to the total, complete domination and control,

13

or whatever the factors are.

14
15

What is the reaction of the Cuban government
to be to that?

16

MR. WAXMAN:

My -- I don't think it's in the

17

record here, but what is in the record are the terms of

18

the lease.

19

that Guantanamo is under the complete, utterly

20

exclusive, jurisdiction and control of the national

21

government of the United States.

22

And I don't really take it to be disputed

That's in the lease, itself.

The courts of

23

Cuba have so held.

They have designated Guantanamo,

24

quote, "foreign territory" unless and until the United

25

States in its sole discretion chooses to vacate the
28

base.

And --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We -- there are --

3

am I wrong that there are Cuban workers who come on to

4

the base and work?

5

MR. WAXMAN:

I'm not sure whether there are,

6

or not, any longer.

7

they are not subject -- and it has never been contended

8

that they are subject -- to Cuban control with respect

9

to conduct that is subject to any law of the United

10

States.

something, one can't sue the other in Cuban courts?

key difference, I think, going to Justice Alito's

question.

That such a suit

Well, first of all, the terms

21

of the lease, and, second of all, I -- I don't know that

22

we cited -- I mean, somebody has cited decisions of the

23

Cuban Government, the judiciary and its executive, that

24

they don't exercise any jurisdiction over --

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The converse question is:

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Could we prosecute a crime committed in Guantanamo by

2

Cubans?

3

And the answer is yes.
MR. WAXMAN:

The answer is certainly yes,

4

and if I can just make the point about bases elsewhere,

5

in Germany and Japan, for example, the status of -- this

6

is the only base, I believe, that -- you know, in

7

something other than an active war zone, that isn't the

8

subject of a status-of-forces agreement that very

9

specifically explicates both the judicial and executive

10

authority over acts that occur on the base.

11

And, for example, under our status-of-forces

12

agreement with Japan, it is entirely clear that if it is

13

a Japanese citizen or a Japanese national or conduct

14

that is subject to the laws of Japan, the Japanese

15

courts have jurisdiction.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You're not heartened by

17

the prospect that the detainees could apply to the Cuban

18

courts, which would then hand process to the Commanding

19

General at Guantanamo?

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. WAXMAN:

22

this way:

Let's put it

It has not occurred to us yet.

23

(Laughter).

24

MR. WAXMAN:

25

Not particularly.

I mean, this is in -- this is

in many respects a uniquely straightforward case.
30
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

really didn't mean to be facetious when I said our

2

national control over Guantanamo is greater than it is

3

over a place in Kentucky, because there we have -- under

4

our system of federalism the Federal Government has

5

limited controls.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought this was

7

decided in Rasul.

That's why I am so puzzled by the

8

Government's position.

9

most clearly when he said that, well, in every practical

I think Justice Kennedy said it

10

respect, Guantanamo Bay is U.S. territory; and whatever

11

Congress recently passed, they can't, as you pointed

12

out, change the terms of the lease.

13

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

I think that's right, and

14

I also think that, although it is correct, as

15

Justice Scalia pointed out at the outset, that the

16

decision in Rasul was a decision about the scope of

17

2241, which has now been amended, and the majority, at

18

least, rendered a decision on the basis of the statute,

19

nonetheless, the Court was construing 2241(c)(1), which

20

is in haec verba with Section 14 of the 1789 act.

21

There are other provisions of the habeas

22

statute like the civil war provisions that -- under

23

which this Court reviews State court convictions and

24

detentions.

25

construing in Rasul was identical in language to the one

But the statute that this Court was

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

promulgated in the -- the very first judiciary act of

2

1789, which this Court has said in Bollman was an

3

instantiation, a positive enactment of the writ, that

4

was protected by the Constitution.

5

And so, while technically, the majority was

6

issuing a statutory ruling -- and we don't contend

7

otherwise -- inferentially, its conclusion must extend

8

to the -- the extent of the writ at common law.

Thank you,

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Since this Court's decision in Rasul,

18

Petitioners' status has been reviewed by a tribunal

19

modeled on Army Regulation 190-8, and Congress has

20

passed two statutes addressing Petitioners' rights.

21

Petitioners now have access to the Article

22

III courts and have a right to judicial review in the

23

D.C. Circuit.

24
25

That review encompasses preponderance
claims, claims that the military did not follow their

own regulations, and statutory and constitutional

2

claims.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:
it was modeled after 190-8.

5

General Clement, you said
Is it identical to 190-8?

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Stevens, it is

6

virtually identical.

7

our brief, you'll see kind of a side-by-side comparison;

8

and the deviations are ones that, we would submit,

9

enhance the rights of the detainees in this particular

10

If you look at pages 50 and 51 of

circumstance.

11

So they are given a right to a personal

12

representative, which is not something that Army

13

Regulation 190-8 provides.

14

provided for the ability to submit documentary evidence.

They are specifically

How is that personal

representative chosen?

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

The personal

18

representative is assigned to the individual by the

19

military.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I mean is that personal

21

representative also under an obligation to report back

22

to the military anything that might be unfavorable to

23

the person he is supposedly representing?

24

GENERAL CLEMENT:

25

Well, I don't know about

"unfavorable," but I think if there's -- certainly, if
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there is material intelligence information, he is to

2

provide that information.

3
4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So he's not -- he is not in

the position of counsel, as we understand the term.

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No.

We are not trying to

6

make the point that the personal representative is a

7

counsel.

8

provided above and beyond 190-8 in terms of the

9

procedure; and there are other particulars as well, like

We're just saying it is something that is

10

there is the notice of the charges in the unclassified

11

summaries that are provided.

12

Now, there's the complaint on the other side

13

that the unclassified summaries aren't particular

14

enough, but it is worth noting that that's something

15

that is provided here that's not specified by 190-8.

16
17
18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Under 190-8, does the

defendant have a right to counsel?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

No, they do not, not under

19

the basic regulations of that.

20

correctly indicated that in a particular instance in

21

Vietnam, counsel was provided in 190-8 proceedings, but

22

those are not provided by the basic 190-8 procedures.

23

And, I think it is worth --

24
25

Now, Mr. Waxman

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The DTA, see, is

unclear to me, anyway, on this question.
34
Alderson Reporting Company

You agree that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there is the authority under the DTA, and I assume under

2

the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in reviewing

3

those determinations, to order a release?

4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

5

answer that, Mr. Chief Justice, is this:

6

DTA does not provide for an order of release.

7

would certainly have taken the position that, as a first

8

order, if the D.C. Circuit finds a defect in the CSTR,

9

we think the proper remedy would be to order a remand

10
11

Well, I -- the way I would
In terms, the
And we

for a new CSTR.
But, certainly, if this Court thinks that

12

the constitutional line is -- essentially necessitates

13

that the D.C. Circuit have the authority to order a

14

release, there is no obstacle to that.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

the availability of release, either, but it has

17

certainly been interpreted to authorize that by habeas

18

courts in this country.

19

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No.

2243 doesn't specify

And the D.C. Circuit

20

would have available to it the All Writs Act, and the

21

D.C. Circuit, in fact, in its Desmoula decision, which

22

is the decision where the Government has filed an en

23

banc petition -- that protective order that was issued

24

there was done pursuant to the All Writs Act.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Yes, but that --

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

GENERAL CLEMENT:

2

been shy about asserting that authority.

3

that's what was required here, they could use that

4

authority to order a release.

5
6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The D.C. Circuit hasn't
And, again, if

But doesn't the resort to

the All Writs Act beg the question?

7

And that is -- I mean the All Writs Act is

8

there to protect jurisdiction, and the question is

9

whether there is jurisdiction to release.

10

And you say there no textual impediment to

11

it; and, yet, we know -- I forget which brief it was in

12

-- from one of the briefs the -- the instance of the

13

prisoner Ali, one of the Chinese -- is it "Uigars"?

14

that how it is pronounced?

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is

"Uigars."
Who was one of what, 12 or

17

13, who was found not to be an enemy combatant, and the

18

Government's position there was:

19

again in front of another tribunal, another panel,

20

which, in fact, conveniently found that he was.

21

Go back and do it

So the practice of -- of the Government, it

22

seems to me, has clearly been to deny the right to

23

release.

24
25

GENERAL CLEMENT:
Justice Souter.

Well, I would disagree,

Let me say a couple of things to that.
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

One is that I think with respect to the

2

Uigars, in particular, there was a problem with ordering

3

release outright.

4

Robertson, the same judge, district court judge, who

5

decided the Hamdan case, had before him one of the

6

Uigars in a habeas petition, he recognized that under

7

habeas he couldn't order release.

8
9
10

And it is interesting that when Judge

And the problem wasn't any kind of inherent
limitation on what he could order in his jurisdiction.
There was just a practical problem, which was --

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

It was a practical

12

problem.

13

habeas jurisdiction, for example, in requiring new

14

trials, and so on, depends upon the ultimate sanction,

15

which is the authority of the court to let somebody go

16

if the Government does not comply with a condition.

17
18

But the fact is that the effectiveness of

And the -- the Government practice so far
under the DTA seems quite contrary to that.

19

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, again, Justice

20

Souter, what I would say is simply this:

21

the Constitution requires to make the DTA to be an

22

adequate substitute is the power to order release, there

23

is no obstacle in the text of the DTA to that.

24

All Writs Act is available to allow them to order

25

That's the argument I want to make.

I don't

see anything in this CSRT provision that permits me to

make that argument.

make that argument?

So I'm asking you:

Where can you

Exactly.
I'm not sure he can make

-JUSTICE BREYER:

If he cannot make that

15

argument, how does this become an equivalent to habeas,

16

since that happens to be the argument that a large

17

number of these 305 people would like to make?

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Breyer, let

19

me take it this way, which is, of course, you're getting

20

to the gravamen of their claim, which is that the DTA

21

and the review provided in the D.C. Circuit is not an

22

adequate substitute for habeas review.

23

second, which I hope is right, because it seems that

to me the right conclusion --

which is that the base

And if you compare what these detainees have

4

under the DTA in terms of judicial review to what would

5

have been available to them at common law in 1789, it is

6

not even close.

7

This is the remarkable liberalization of the

8

writ, not some retrenchment or suspension of the writ.

These detainees at common law would face not one, but

10

three obstacles, to getting into court to make these

claims.

your -- your principal objection goes to the

I didn't want to get into the prisoner of war point.

prisoner of war point is the United States is not

treating them as prisoners of war.

recognized in Kirin and Hamdi and most particularly in

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well two things,

6

Justice Souter.

One thing is that with respect to the

7

definition that the military commissions -- I'm sorry --

8

that the C-Cert 7 apply, that is a broader definition, I

9

would quickly add though that with respect to the

10

majority of individuals -- I mean you have the

11

Petitioners from Bosnia that Mr. Waxman represents, but

12

most of these people were seized in Pakistan and

13

Afghanistan, and so the situation is not that different.

14

And obviously we would take the position to the extent

15

you have some concerns about the breadth of the

16

definition, what this Court -- what the plurality said

17

in Hamdi in footnote 1 gets it exactly right.

18

to deal with those concerns is in the adjudication of

particular cases which can take place under the DTA or

can take place in habeas.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I think, again, that

23

Justice Breyer's hypothetical, as I understood it, sort

24

of assumed away the adequacy of all of the standards and

25

just said:

Putting all of that to one side, I have some
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

other constitutional claim.

2

And I'm just not so sure that habeas ever

3

allowed you to sort of bring every claim that you

4

possibly wanted to; and I think the -- what I -- the way

5

I read this Court's Hamdi decision is what was

6

envisioned on a habeas case in a case where Army

7

Regulation 190-8, which, of course, the plurality cited,

8

was complied with.

9

petition in court would take that as a starting point,

It was in that case:

The habeas

and that you wouldn't necessarily be able to say:

it was nice that we had that proceeding, but put that to

your answer to Justice Breyer -- and maybe I'm missing

25

something -- would be that there is a third alternative
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

which he didn't consider, namely:

That these are

2

combatants picked up on the battlefield, and they may be

3

detained indefinitely without proving they committed a

4

crime.

5

And that is your position, I think.

6

GENERAL CLEMENT:

That is our position.

I

7

mean I want to give Justice Breyer's hypothetical its

8

due.

9

brought, hypothetical claims that you could have brought

10
11

I mean there might be claims that you could have

at some level, and that the DTA does -JUSTICE STEVENS:

You have a hypothetical

12

claim that a particular prisoner says:

13

by people who were not in the United States Army and

14

sold for a bounty.

15

there when I got kidnapped.

16

I was kidnapped

And I am -- I just happened to be

And then there is a genuine question of fact

17

as to whether the fact that they may have been sold in

18

that manner justifies detention, which is a different

19

question entirely from whether they committed a

20

violation under the law of war.

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Absolutely,

22

Justice Stevens.

But that question, of course, can be

23

considered by the D.C. Circuit on review, because

24

they're specifically entitled to a preponderance review

25

in the D.C. Circuit.

So that's a claim that they
56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

clearly could bring.
They can also bring the statutory and

3

constitutional claims to the standards and procedures,

4

and they can make claims that the procedures that are

5

set forth in the CSRTs are not provided.

6

again, if you compare that to what they would have had

7

at the common law, and you ask the question --

8
9

JUSTICE STEVENS:
and I know your argument.

And I think,

Let me interrupt again,

But with respect to those

10

claims, do you make the argument in your brief that some

11

evidence is enough to refute that claim, or do you say

12

it is a preponderance standard?

13

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It's a preponderance

14

standard, and that's what is set forth in the statute.

15

And, again, that's something where Congress specifically

16

got involved in the CSRTs in a way that I think is

17

different from the Hamdan case and Congress's

18

involvement with the Military Commissions.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

challenges to the adequacy of the standards, or

whatever, are the sort of things that would be raised in

25

opportunity to rule on those.

4

a facial challenge.

5

I mean, in order for them to prevail with

6

the argument that DTA review is an inadequate

7

substitute, they really have to say that it is

8

inherently an inadequate substitute.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

fact that it has taken six years to have the issue

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I mean --

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They say they have

16

been unlawfully detained for six years from the

17

beginning.

18

question of whether they have been provided such a

19

wonderful set of procedures?

20

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And isn't that delay relevant to the

Well, Justice Stevens, I

21

think the delay is going to be relevant to whether or

22

not courts should expedite hearings, and the like.

23

I don't think it should cloud the basic constitutional

24

question before this Court.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
58
Alderson Reporting Company

But

The procedures that

are before us under the DTA and the MCA, of course,

2

weren't available for the whole six-year period, were

3

they?

4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No, of course not.

And I

5

think it is worth recognizing that Congress legislated

in this area not in year one, and then six years have

7

gone by.

8

procedures and this level of review in years four and

9

five.

10

Congress legislated with these particular

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

called a habeas petition.

come in and said:

this is we are going to remove jurisdiction for that

habeas petition, and we're going to allow you to file a

10

But our position is they

Congress subsequently has

The way we are going to deal with

Now, their argument is that Congress can't

11

force that choice on them because this is an inadequate

substitute for habeas.

Guantanamo; and therefore, the DTA is effectively

14

unconstitutional to the extent it prevents us with

16

The Suspension Clause applies in

Now, there are a variety of ways this Court

17

could reject that claim.

18

straightforward way, though, is to simply ask the

19

question:

20

the DTA petition were provided by statute in 1789 or

21

even 1941, for that matter, would it have been seen as a

22

liberalization of the writ, or a contraction and

23

suspension of the writ?

24
25

It seems to me that the most

If the level of review provided by the DTA in

And I think it is very, very clear that if
this statute had passed, if this kind of review was
60
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

provided in 1789 or in 1941, it would have been greeted

2

as a remarkable -- remarkable liberalization of the writ

3

as it had then been understood.

4

And I think we are in the situation where

5

these individuals, for the first time, are really

6

allowed this kind of access to the court system.

7

And when that happens, there are going to be

8

difficult questions.

We have difficult questions about

9

what the record on review is.

We have difficult

10

questions about the extent to which classified

11

information should come in.

12

But all of those difficult questions are

13

going to be waiting for us if we go back to the habeas

14

courts, because the same kind of issues --

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, on that -- and you

16

just mentioned remedy.

17

hope for, that the Court were to say that this is -- we

18

have a minute or two.

19

Suppose, contrary to what you

Suppose they were to say that this is an

20

unconstitutional suspension of the writ, and that the

21

remedy here written in the statute is not adequate in

22

respect to many claims that might be made.

23

On that assumption, the habeas would lie.

24

Now, it has been six years, and habeas is supposed to be

25

speedy.
61
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And, yet, people have serious arguments,

2

anyway, that they are being held for six years without

3

even having those arguments heard.

4

Is there anything in your opinion that this

5

Court could say by way of remedy that could get the

6

D.C. Circuit or the others to decide this and the CSRT

7

claims, there are 305 people to do this quickly within a

8

period of months rather than six more years?

9

what?

10

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And if so,

I mean, obviously lower

11

courts take anything this Court says very, very

12

seriously.

13

So, if this Court makes it clear -JUSTICE BREYER:

Are we faced with this

14

problem, and I don't want to put you right on the spot,

15

what approximately would you say in respect to this?

16

Because it is a serious problem.

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I mean -- let me --

18

if I could, I would answer it as to what this Court

19

should say about what the D.C. Circuit should do on DTA

20

review.

21

rather than the opinion where we lose.

22

I prefer to discuss the opinion where we win

As to that opinion, the courts -- the lower

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If we affirmed on

reasoning as it stands, these interesting questions that

21

you referred to will never arise.

22

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I don't think that's

23

right, Justice Souter.

There is active litigation going

24

on in the D.C. Circuit over basically these questions

25

and how this litigation is going to take place.
63
Alderson Reporting Company

And if

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this Court in affirming on -- begrudgingly affirming and

2

directing the D.C. Circuit to move with all appropriate

3

dispatch, that's going to be read just as carefully and

4

taken just as seriously if it's an affirmance than if

5

it's a vacate or a reversal.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is that because the

7

withdrawal of jurisdiction does not apply to review of

8

the proceedings in the D.C. Circuit that's provided

9

under the statute?

In other words, your argument that

10

the habeas jurisdiction doesn't extend doesn't reach the

11

review of the adequacy of the DTA proceedings?

12
13

GENERAL CLEMENT:

That's exactly right.

That's exactly right.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why would they litigate

15

that adequacy if they have determined in advance that

16

substantively the individuals who are petitioning have

17

absolutely no rights?

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

They hadn't decided that,

Justice Souter.

Official - Subject to Final Review

So there will be a meaningful procedure in
the D.C. Circuit --

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

At the end of the day, the

5

only thing, as I understand it, that could possibly be

6

adjudicated would be the question of formal adherence to

7

procedure or not.

8

that ever went to the merits because the merits issue,

9

as I understand it, is already -- I mean merits of

There would never be an adjudication

10

relief -- have already been prior admitted by the

11

existing determination of the circuit in this case.

12

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Souter, I'm

13

not sure that this Court -- I understand your question,

14

I believe, which is that the D.C. Circuit, I think,

15

almost unavoidably reading this Court's Rasul decision

16

and reading it as a statutory rather than a

17

constitutional holding, has stuck with its circuit

18

precedent and said that there aren't constitutional

19

rights here.

20

reverses it in habeas or in the DTA review.

21

That is going to be true unless this Court

It would seem particularly strange that if

22

that's the real problem that this Court would somehow

23

decide, well, you know, we really think the DTA is an

24

adequate substitute, but the only way we can correct

25

this other mistake, in our view, that the D.C. Circuit
65
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is laboring under is to rule against the government.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You were arguing that the

3

question of the adequacy of the substitution should, in

fact, be litigated in a plenary fashion in the Court of

Appeals or the district court for that matter?

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

I think that's the

And this Court, for

I thought you said a moment

10

ago that there were all of these interesting questions

11

that could be explored if there was a remand?

12
13

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I'm sorry, Justice Souter,

I may have misspoke.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Maybe I misunderstood you.
The interesting questions

16

that I think are left on the remand, no matter what, are

17

issues about whether or not based on the Abraham

18

declaration that the military followed their own

19

procedures for assembling the record below, or whether

20

the military followed its own procedures for providing

21

exculpatory evidence.

22

aren't questions that require the answer to the question

23

of whether Eisentrager is still good law --

24
25

Those are all questions that

JUSTICE SOUTER:

GENERAL CLEMENT:

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I mean -You're talking about

taking the statute, Congress's statute that set up this

4

system with limited review in the D.C. Circuit and

5

saying that's it.

6

question because it said the acts that these people are

7

trying to bring habeas doesn't exist.

8

that they have, the only remedy they have is the one

9

that Congress provided.

The D.C. Circuit never got to that

The only thing

And it seems to me the only

10

question before us is whether there is jurisdiction in

11

the court of appeals to decide that threshold issue.

12

They tossed it out and didn't reach -- didn't say one

13

word about the adequacy of the procedures or of the

14

things that you're talking about.

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think that's right,

16

Justice Ginsburg.

I want to be clear that my position

17

is that an alternative ground for affirmance, which

18

would allow this Court to address some of those

19

questions, is that the D.C. Circuit was right to say

20

that the DTA review, that the habeas petition should be

21

dismissed.

22

DTA is an adequate substitute for habeas.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The reason they were right is because the

That would be -- we would

24

be deciding that as a court of first view because they

25

didn't decide that?

You don't need an adequate
67
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

substitute for habeas because you have no right to

2

habeas.

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think that's a fair

4

observation, but obviously this Court --

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

General Clement --

6

GENERAL CLEMENT:

In the context --

I mean

7

this has been fully briefed in, and in the context of

8

where the Court uses an alternative ground for

9

affirmance, it would not be a novel situation, I don't

10
11

think.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

General Clement, your

12

suggested reason why they're right is quite different

13

from the reason they actually gave.

14

the question of the adequacy of these procedures.

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

They did not reach

I think that's a fair

16

point, Justice Stevens, though I would say that really

17

their reasoning encapsulates one of the three reasons

18

why at common law they were right.

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but they did not

20

reach this very important part of the whole case.

21

Of course, the substitute procedures here are not nearly

22

the same as those in our prior cases of where we

23

sustained the 2255 and district here.

24
25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And,

Oh, that's right,

Justice Stevens, but in fairness, in those situations
68
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you were dealing with sort of substitutes for core

2

habeas under situations where they're was no dispute

3

that there was a robust right to habeas at common law,

4

and so here you first deal with the situation of -- all

5

right, the baseline is, as Judge Friendly suggests,

6

1789, is this an adequate substitute?

7

somehow -- and I don't know how you get past that --

8

then you I think still might ask the question that this

9

Court asked in the Felker case, which is, you know,

And that even if

10

giving some deference to Congress's ability to shape the

11

scope of the writ, is there a problem here?

12

would point the Court to Felker.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I think we

And you say those later

14

cases are not relevant because habeas corpus in the

15

modern world is much broader than it was in 1789.

16

That's part of your point?

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

That is part of our point.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.

19

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And we would say, though

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And the comparison you ask

20
21

--

22

us to make is between what the habeas writ was in 1789,

23

not what the comparison to a habeas writ would be today?

24
25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

We would start with that

proposition, but I think this isn't a case where it's
69
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

just 1789 versus today because as I read this -- -

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I don't think you would

3

seriously contend that the procedures set forth in the

4

statute are equivalent to those afforded under the

5

habeas writ under today's jurisdiction?

6
7

GENERAL CLEMENT:
me to answer -- -

8
9
10

It's a hard question for

JUSTICE STEVENS:

At least you haven't

argued that.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, no, but I mean the

11

question is, you know, in a different case, sure, there

12

would be a different habeas.

13

the answer as to what habeas looks like in the context

14

of enemy combatants detained in a place like Guantanamo,

15

and we suggest, based on our best reading of Hamdi that,

16

if there was habeas jurisdiction now, that the

17

proceeding that would unfold would not be the plenary

18

habeas that is envisioned by Petitioners but would be a

19

much more narrowly circumscribed habeas.

20

point out that, again, it's not just --

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But we don't know sort of

I would also

On the point I made, I

22

think that's critical to your argument that the

23

substitute is adequate.

24
25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think that's right.

would say, though, that our only baseline is not 1789

I

70
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

because, as we read this Court's decision in Rasul,

2

Rasul is based on the predicate that until 1973 and

3

Braden's overruling of Ahrens, that the habeas statute

4

would not have gone to Guantanamo.

5

Court is willing to say that there was an inchoate

6

Suspension Clause violation until 1973 when Braden comes

7

along, it seems like the tradition in this country too,

8

based on the immediate custodian rule and the

9

territorial jurisdiction of the courts, was that habeas

in Guantanamo is a novelty.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH W. WAXMAN.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

MR. WAXMAN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

7

I want to speak mostly about the adequacy of

8

the substitute and particularly the question that you

9

and Justice Kennedy asked about adjudication of the

10

standard on remand, but just to take first things first,

11

I don't -- I don't believe I've ever seen the

12

13

by the government before.

14

say.

15

the CSRTs is a liberalization of the traditional writ.

16

As this Court made -- or the King's Bench made clear in

17

the Bushell's case and all of the commentators including

18

Sharpe, who both sides are citing as authoritative, here

19

agree in cases of executive detention, where there

20

wasn't a trial occurring, the court absolutely could --

21

the prisoner could controvert the facts of the return in

22

Schiever and Spanish Citizens -- Spanish Prisoners,

23

there wasn't an original hearing because the court

24

issued -- sat as nisi prius court and considered

25

affidavits of the prisoners and third parties and

And I don't know what they

But it is absolutely incorrect that DTA review of

72
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

determined on the basis of the affidavits that they were

2

prisoners of war.

3

But it is absolutely clear that the writ did

4

extend to the question of "I am not a combatant.

I am

5

not a warrior, number one.

6

non-criminal detentions to the underlying facts of the

7

detention, and that goes to the point about the standard

8

that Justice Kennedy asked and the Chief Justice asked.

9

We agree that, if and when the D.C. Circuit

And number two, it did go in

10

ever addresses the merits of these cases, and not only

11

is there no CSR -- complete record on return in any

12

case, but the government has suggested they proceed five

13

at a time, and we're now two years running without a

14

single one -- but there's no doubt that the argument

15

we're making in Roman numeral 2 of our brief, that the

16

CSR, the Wolfowitz definition is not authorized

17

detention under the AUMF, which as this Court in Hamdi

18

said, incorporates long-established law-of-war

19

principles and American traditions.

20

We can raise that claim because they have to

22

consistent not only with the Constitution but also with

23

the laws of the United States.

this --

25

And the problem this is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
73
Alderson Reporting Company

That is an argument

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that, I gather, both sides agree is available to you

2

under the DTA before the D.C. Circuit.

3

MR. WAXMAN:

That is absolutely correct.

4

But what -- what habeas at its core was -- and we're

5

talking -- I'm happy to live in the world of 1789 now --

6

is executive detention and not the more modern

7

innovations where, well, certain procedures weren't

8

constitutional or whatever, but you have no right to

9

hold me.

10

The facts won't allow you to hold me.

D.C. Circuit cannot --

11
12

The

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What does that tell you

about the adequacy of the substitute?

13

MR. WAXMAN:

Because the D.C. Circuit --

14

because the D.C. Circuit is reviewing a record that was

15

adduced ex parte, in camera, with a presumption to boot

16

that it is -- that the evidence is both accurate and

17

complete, and the D.C. Circuit is -- has already said it

18

will not hear any new evidence and it must apply that

19

same presumption that that evidence that was heard ex

20

parte in camera with its own presumption is correct.

21

And here's -- let me just give you an example of what

22

difference this makes.

23

of Judge Green's district court opinion.

24

discusses -- she does address the adequacy of the

25

substitute.

You have the unredacted version
I don't.

And she addresses the case of two

individuals.

2

you have both in her opinion and our brief this truly

3

Kafka-esque colloquy at his hearing in which he is

4

accused of associating with a known Al-Qaeda operative,

5

which he denies, but he can't be told the name.

6

One is Mr. Ait-Idir, who is my client, and

Mr. Kurnaz is the other Petitioner who is

7

discussed in her brief.

He was a Petitioner in this

8

Court, but he has since been released by the government

9

because of the fact that he had what the CSRTs won't

10

give him, which is a lawyer.

He was told, two years

11

after he was detained -- he's a German permanent

12

resident -- he was told at his CSRT, as many of these

13

individuals were not, that he was being held because he

14

associated with a known terrorist.

15

name.

And he was told the

16

He was told that he associated with somebody

17

called Selcook Bilgen who, the government contended, was

18

(a) a terrorist, who was -- had blown himself up while

19

Mr. Kurnaz was in detention -- may I simply finish this

20

account -- while he was in detention and in a suicide

21

bombing; and all that Mr. Kurnaz could say at his CSRT

22

where he had no lawyer and had no access to information

23

was I never had any reason to suspect he was a

24

terrorist.

25

Well, when the government, in the habeas
75
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

proceedings, filed its factual return in Judge Green's

2

court, it filed as its factual return the CSRT record.

3

His counsel saw that accusation.

4

counsel had affidavits not only from the German

5

prosecutor but from the supposedly deceased Mr. Bilgen,

6

who is a resident of Dresden never involved in terrorism

7

and fully getting on with his life.

Within 24 hours, his

That's what -- and that evidence would not
have been allowed in under DTA review.

It wouldn't have

10

been in the CSRT, and it won't come in under DTA review.

11

And that's why it is inadequate.

Thank you,

Mr. Waxman.

The case is submitted.
