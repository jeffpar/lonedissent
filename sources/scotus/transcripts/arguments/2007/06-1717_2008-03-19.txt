CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

4

first this morning in Case 06-1717, Richlin Security

5

Service versus Chertoff.

6

Mr. Wolfman.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. WOLFMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Federal Circuit affirmed an award of

12

attorney fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, or

13

EAJA, to Petitioner Richlin Security Services Company,

14

but it denied Richlin an award for paralegal services at

15

market rates on the ground that statutory attorney fees

16

do not include work done by paralegals.

17

The Federal Circuit was wrong because, as

18

this Court has explained, the statutory term "attorney

19

fees" -- and now I'm quoting -- "takes into account the

20

work not only of attorneys but others whose labor

21

contributes to the work product for which an attorney

22

bills her client."

23

held, in Missouri versus Jenkins, that paralegal fees

24

are compensable at market rates as attorney fees under

25

42 U.S.C. section 1988.

Employing that reasoning the Court

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The question in this case is whether there

2

is any reason EAJA should be interpreted differently.

3

The answer is no.

4

relevant difference between the two statutes -- that

5

EAJA requires fees to be awarded at prevailing market

6

rates, and section 1988 requires only that fees be

7

reasonable -- provides stronger support for market-based

8

recovery of paralegal fees under EAJA than it would

9

under section 1988.

10

And, indeed, the only potentially

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Wolfman, what about

11

the cap that's not present in 1988 and is present in

12

EAJA?

13

MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, that

14

really is, when we get down to it, what the government's

15

argument boils down to.

16

irrelevant for two reasons, both of which are important.

17

First, and let me -- let me first state the argument;

18

then I'll give you the answers.

And I think the cap is

19

But the argument that the government posits

20

is -- taking a lead from the Federal Circuit -- is that

21

paralegal services can't be compensable at market rates

22

under EAJA because then paralegal services would be

23

fully or largely compensable, while lawyers' fees to the

24

extent that they exceed the cap would not be.

25

there are two answers to that:

And again

First, the argument

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

incorrectly looks at EAJA from today's perspective when

2

lawyers' rates generally exceed the fee cap.

3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. WOLFMAN:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Absolutely.
They couldn't go above the

cap.

8
9

The paralegals'

rates would also be subject to the -- to the cap.

5

7

Excuse me.

MR. WOLFMAN:

There is no question about

that because -- because, Your Honor, they are attorney's
fees.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. WOLFMAN:

Okay.

That's our submission.

But -

13

but the problem with looking at it at the current

14

vantage point, which is what the Federal Circuit

15

essentially did, is that at the time EAJA was enacted,

16

most lawyers -

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I just ask on that

18

last point, does the government agree that the

19

paralegals' fees are subject to a cap?

20

MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, the government would

21

certainly agree that if there are attorney's fees, they

22

are subject to the cap.

23

above the cap for anything.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MR. WOLFMAN:

They are not willing to pay

Indeed, would insist.

Yes, indeed, Your Honor.
5

Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

at any rate -

2
3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

the bottom line that they are subject to cap?

4
5

But they do not agree with

MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, what they believe -- the

government -

6

JUSTICE STEVENS: -- attorney's fees.

7

MR. WOLFMAN:

And I'm sure they can explain

8

this better than I can.

9

position is, is that they are like an out-of-pocket

10

But what the government's

expense -

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

12

MR. WOLFMAN: -- reimbursable only at the

13

cost to the lawyer.

14

Your Honor, because one could -- one could posit a

15

situation 20, 30 years out from now, if EAJA were not

16

amended, where even the cost to the lawyer could exceed

17

the cap.

18

of collapses upon itself.

19

they are all attorney's fees and they are all subject to

20

the cap.

21

That's an interesting question,

So, in a way, the government's argument sort
We -- we -- our submission is

But let me go JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you -- isn't that one

22

of the problems with your argument?

23

something very strange about capping paralegal fees at

24

the same amount that they would cap a lawyer's fees for,

25

regardless of what that amount is and when they were
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Because there is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

setting it.

2

MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, again, that's -- that's

3

-- I took to be Justice Ginsburg's question and let me

4

try to answer it.

5

that's a strange situation, which we don't agree with,

6

but even assuming it's a strange situation, again it

7

looks at the situation from today's perspective, not at

8

the time -

9

First, as I say, by -- by positing

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, I'm looking at it from

10

the perspective of the original enactment on your theory

11

at that moment.

12

attorney fees, and they were capped at the same amount

13

that a lawyer's time was capped at.

14

odd.

15

These fees were legal fees, were

MR. WOLFMAN:

And that's just

Well, I don't believe it's

16

odd.

And, again, for two reasons:

At that point -

17

again, you have to take the perspective where they are

18

at.

19

at the same point, but all those fees were arrayed, by

20

and large, under the cap so that there would be

21

paralegal fees at a relatively low rate, junior

22

associates at a modest rate, and the senior partner's

23

closer to the cap.

Lawyers' fees and paralegal fees were really capped

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, agent fees -

By and large 7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, the problem exists

2

whether or not you make paralegal fees attorney's fees,

3

because agent fees are also subject to the same cap.

4

MR. WOLFMAN:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

That is true.
And agents were paid a good

deal less than that.

7

MR. WOLFMAN:

That is true.

That is another

8

argument that could be made.

Agents, who are

9

individuals that are qualified by an administrative

10

agency, in essence, to practice law without the

11

supervision of a lawyer, they are also allowed fees

12

under the administrative part of EAJA, but not under

13

section 2412, which is the court part of EAJA.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You began -- and it's not

15

just because of my notepad but because I'm interested -

16

you told Justice Ginsburg there are two reasons -

17

MR. WOLFMAN:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

cap is wrong.

20

first one.

21

Yes.
-- why the government's

And I'm not even sure you finished the

What are the two reasons?
MR. WOLFMAN:

I would love that opportunity,

22

Your Honor.

The first, again, is, -- and let me come

23

back to this if I didn't get it out completely -- which

24

is that, again, it's looking at the -- at the problem,

25

if there is one from the -- the current-day perspective,
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

but what you had at the time, by and large, was that

2

lawyers' and paralegal rates would be arrayed below the

3

cap.

4

within the contemplation of Congress.

It's just not something that would have been

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

6

MR. WOLFMAN:

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But let me -

But may I ask you this?

Yes.
Supposing at the time the

8

statute was enacted, paralegals' fees were not generally

9

treated as lawyers' fees, but rather were disbursements,

10

does that make a difference?

11

MR. WOLFMAN:

That might have made a

12

difference, but that was not the case, Your Honor.

13

fact, what the Court pointed out in Missouri versus

14

Jenkins, which was 1989, nine years later, paralegal

15

fees -- it appeared to be that they were separately

16

billed in about three-quarters of all law firms.

17

1980 it was probably fewer.

In

In

There was a transition

But let me give you the Court's response to

20

that problem in Missouri versus Jenkins, to the extent

21

that it is a problem.

22

whether they're separately billed or not, they were

23

subsumed within the lawyer's rates like other forms of

24

doesn't -- doesn't inform the question of how you

2

interpret the term "attorney's fees."

3

Court said in Missouri versus Jenkins and what it

4

reaffirmed two years later in the West Virginia

5

Hospitals versus Casey.

6

That's what the

Now, let me, if I could, get to the second

7

point which Justice Kennedy asked me about.

The second

8

point is that the government's argument proves far too

9

much, because under the Federal Circuit's theory, which

10

the government has now adopted, the fees generated by

11

law firm associates would also not be compensable at

12

market rates because a much higher percentage of an

13

associate's billed rate would also fall below the cap as

14

compared to the senior partners in the firm.

15

words, it doesn't help explain the problem.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other

I'm sorry.

Is your

17

point there that most associates are billed at less than

18

$125 an hour?

19

MR. WOLFMAN:
My point is this:

No.

That's not my point, Your

20

Honor.

The -- the theory of the

21

government's argument is that you would -- you would be,

22

in essence, giving too much recovery to the lower -- to

23

the lower-billed billing agents, whether they be

24

paralegals, junior associates, and so forth.

25

when you get up to the senior partners 10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Too much money

proportionally.

3

MR. WOLFMAN:

Proportionally.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

5

MR. WOLFMAN:

That's the argument.

Exactly.

6

In all events, some of those various individuals' rates

7

will be compensated under EAJA.

8

Our point is that it proves far too much

9

because the junior associates are much more like the

10

paralegals than the senior associates at the largest K

11

Street or Wall Street law firm.

12

only submission -- point in that regard is that it shows

13

that the government's argument proves too much because

14

it illustrates that the government's concern and the

15

Federal Circuit's concern, the anomaly that they have

16

pointed out, has nothing to do with the statutory term

17

"attorney fees" and nothing to do with paralegals, per

18

se.

19

the rate -- the hyperinflation in the legal services

20

market as a whole has outstripped EAJA.

21

phenomenon on which the Federal Circuit, in truth, was

22

relying, even though they put it to the paralegal

23

question.

24
25

And my only point -- my

It's the phenomenon that's at work is the fact that

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's the

If -- if paralegal charges

are not fees but are other expenses, what would be the
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

standard for determining the rate at which they would be

2

compensable?

3

statute or would it simply be what is reasonable?

4

Would it necessarily be cost under this

MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, that's -- that's an

5

excellent question.

I think it, in part, undermines the

6

government's position because what happened here is that

7

the Federal Circuit and the Board of Contract Appeals

8

below said, well, it's cost to the lawyer, and we are

9

going to do an Internet search and we are going to find

10

what paralegal salaries are and divide it by the

11

requisite number of hours in any year.

12

to make it $35 an hour, and we are going to determine

13

that's the cost to the law firm.

14

And we are going

But, of course, that's -- that's not the

15

cost to the law firm.

16

about the rent, utilities, and so forth, what about

17

benefits?

18

analysis.

19

What about the overhead?

What

So what you would have is a very complex cost

Now, you're suggesting, Your Honor, that we

20

could do it on some vague notion of reasonableness.

21

the problem is that the -- the fee-shifting statutes

22

either look to market rate or actual cost.

23

interesting about the actual cost argument here -- and

24

that's true across the entire range of fee-shifting

25

statutes -- and what's interesting about 12
Alderson Reporting Company

But

But what is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This problem is going to

2

exist anyway, isn't it?

I mean, even if you don't cram

3

paralegals into the other expenses, there are going to

4

be other expenses that are in the other expenses.

5

MR. WOLFMAN:

But -

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're going to have to

7

have this same problem -- and what about the overhead

8

and so forth?

9

MR. WOLFMAN:

No, that is -- with respect,

10

Justice Scalia, that is not correct because the problem

11

here is -- and I'm using your words -- is that the

12

government is cramming a in-house professional

13

services -- service into a place where no court

14

virtually in the history of American jurisprudence has

15

ever put it.

16

Out-of-pocket -

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if -- if it's simply

17

reasonableness -- because I don't see anything in the

18

statute that says that all non-fee expenses are

19

compensable at cost -- if it's simply reasonableness,

20

would it be possible to say that what would be

21

reasonable would be a rate that preserves the ratio

22

between attorneys' fees and paralegal fees that existed

23

at the time when the statute was enacted so that you

24

wouldn't have the problem of attorneys being compensated

25

at the same rate as paralegals?
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. WOLFMAN:

Let me -- let me answer that

2

in two ways:

3

seems to me that the -- in many markets, the paralegals

4

are going to get right near the cap anyway or, you know,

5

between $75 and $100, because we know that many lawyers'

6

rates are well above the cap -- if you preserve that

7

ratio -

8
9

If you were to preserve the ratio, then it

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.

No.

If the ratio -- if

lawyers were -- I know that if lawyers were compensated

10

at $125 an hour when this was enacted and paralegals

11

were compensated at $75, then it would be a 2-1 ratio,

12

and you'd preserve that.

13

MR. WOLFMAN:

Yes.

You could do that, and

14

what you would have is just a static rate for all

15

players in the market, and there's no suggestion that

16

Congress intended that.

17

"prevailing market rates" -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

After all, I using the term

Am I to understand, you

19

claim that even if they are expenses, they should -

20

they should be paid for at market rate, don't you?

21

MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, not quite market rate,

22

but this goes to -- I said I had two responses to

23

Justice Alito's question.

24
25

And the problem is that when we talk about
out-of-pocket expenses, again, which is where the
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

government is trying to shoe-horn the paralegal

2

services, we talk about out-of-pocket expenses for the

3

client, for the prevailing party.

4

they are out-of-pocket expenses or attorney fees are -

5

are awarded to the prevailing party, and the cost faced

6

by the prevailing party is the cost to the prevailing

7

party, what it paid for the paralegal services.

8
9
10

Expenses, whether

Now, that will approximate the market rate,
no question about it.

It might not always be synonymous

with it.

11

Justice Alito, I am not suggesting that

12

Congress could not have done it that way, but there is

13

no suggestion that it did.

14

compared to other fee-shifting statutes, it specifically

15

said it wants to work at the prevailing market rate.

16

And the only reason that in some markets for some

17

lawyers the -- the ceiling, the cap has become a floor

18

is because of hyperinflation in the legal services

19

market.

20

paralegal services vis-a-vis junior associates, as I've

21

mentioned.

22

After all, in this statute,

It has nothing to do with the compensability of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Wolfman, if there's

23

any discretion in the district judge in setting the

24

amount of the fee, then why wouldn't it be appropriate

25

to say, now there's a cap for the lawyer is $125 an
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hour, but we know the true market rate for that lawyer

2

is $200?

3

The true market rate is X, and we're going to knock it

4

down so that it will match the knock-down for the

5

lawyer?

Does it do the same thing with the paralegal?

6

MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, the reason for that

7

is -- is that there -- there is no suggestion at all

8

that that's what was being contemplated in this statute.

9

And that may be the way that if you had seen this

10

phenomenon that's developed, which again is

11

hyperinflation in the legal services market, you might

12

have written it that way.

13

It's true that the courts have discretion.

14

There's always a reasonableness factor.

15

overriding factor is the market rate.

16

"prevailing market rate."

17

outside the bounds of any discretion that had been

18

afforded.

19

But the
The Congress said

And to me, that would be

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But isn't it likely that

20

when Congress said that, it was not thinking of

21

paralegals.

22

MR. WOLFMAN:

No.

I think -- I don't think

23

-- with respect, I don't think that's the question.

24

Going back -- that takes us back to Missouri versus

25

Jenkins, and what the Court said there is that you have
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this word "attorney's fee," and the way of thinking of

2

attorney's fees is to include everything that goes into

3

the labor of the attorney that ultimately gets billed to

4

the client and that paralegal services are an aspect of

5

that.

6

Two years later, in West Virginia University

7

Hospitals, the Court made -- made essentially the same

8

point again, which is that -- that at the time that all

9

these fee-shifting statutes were passed, paralegal

10

services, to the extent that they existed, were

11

traditionally subsumed within the lawyer's rate.

12

that once law firms started billing for them

13

separately -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so

I'm sorry.

15

"Traditionally subsumed in the lawyer's rate," are you

16

suggesting, when this statute was passed, they weren't

17

billed separately to the client?

18

MR. WOLFMAN:

No.

I'm not suggesting that.

19

I'm saying traditionally, well before they were passed,

20

they were subsumed to the market rate.

21

came to be a tradition, roughly in the '70s and early

22

'80s, for the separate billing.

23

emphatically in Missouri versus Jenkins was that the

24

separate billing didn't tell you anything about whether

25

there were attorney's fees.

There -- there

And what the Court held

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Let me -- let me -- if I could extend my

2

answer a little bit.

3

argument is here, the government's argument is that if

4

the paralegal fee, the paralegal services, are subsumed

5

within the lawyer's rate, if there were a law firm out

6

there that still didn't do the separate billing, that

7

would be compensable as an attorney's fees when billed

8

within the lawyer's rate.

9

separately under EAJA, the government's position is

10

Appreciating what the government's

But if they're billed

they're not compensable at lawyers' rates.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, that's no loss

12

to the government because when you put it into the

13

lawyer's rate, you hit the ceiling for the lawyer's rate

14

that much sooner.

15

MR. WOLFMAN:

wouldn't have gotten as high as the cap?

4

I -- of course, we don't think

19

Federal Circuit claimed that to the extent that there

work than is efficient to paralegals, and it's -

4

MR. WOLFMAN:

I certainly agree that it is

5

unlikely, but as we point -- very unlikely.

6

with that, Mr. Chief Justice, but there is another point

7

that I would make that we cover quite extensively in our

8

brief, which is that -- which is that -- I think you

9

have to step back and think about that for a second,

10

I agree

what the Federal Circuit did.

11

The notion that lawyers are going to shunt

12

off work to paralegals that they wouldn't otherwise

13

have, there are -- runs head long into both economic and

14

ethical constraints on the profession.

15

because if that was occurring, i.e., people were -

16

lawyers were giving paralegals work that they could not

17

sensibly do, clients would, one, insist that work not be

18

allocated like that; or, two, take their business

19

elsewhere.

That's the economic constraints.

MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

2

will -- I believe that you have greater experience on

3

that than I do.

4

But I think the other answer to that is the

5

ethical constraints.

6

constraints -- I mean, as we pointed out in our brief,

7

sure, the paralegal profession has become an impressive

8

one.

9

no question.

10

Even if there weren't economic

They do a lot of things that lawyers used to do,
But a lawyer can't shunt off work that

they can't handle because there are ethical constraints.

11

I can't, for instance, give a paralegal,

12

say, responsibility for -- principal responsibility for

13

writing an appellate brief.

14

that because they can't do that, generally speaking,

15

because of their training and experience.

16

I could not or would not do

So I just think that just falls apart.

And

17

as you say, Mr. Chief Justice, the fact that -- of the

18

substantial justification defense and other reasons as

19

well, it's unlikely -- and this gets back to Justice

20

Kennedy's questions -- unlikely that law firms will

21

structure their practices and businesses around this

22

problem.

23

The real problem, though, is not an attack

24

on the government fisc, as we point out in our brief.

25

The impact on the public fisc for rejecting the Federal

EAJA applicants:

9

services to their lawyers.

In all three situations, clients will lose

For the latter two groups,

10

veterans and Social Security claimants, Federal law, in

11

fact, requires that EAJA -- that the EAJA fee be paid to

12

the claimant.

13

So, although it makes economic sense for

14

paralegals to work on significant aspects of Social

15

Security and veterans' cases -- and that's set out at

16

some length in the amicus brief of the National

17

Association of Legal Assistants -- the claimants will

18

lose those fees under the government's view of EAJA.

in footnote 2 of this Court's decision in Scarborough.

3

They are also set forth

The way the Social Security and veterans

4

situations work -- and, again, they comprise the

5

majority of these cases -- is that the Federal law

6

allows the lawyer to take a contingent fee out of the

7

back benefits, not to exceed 20 and 25 percent of the

8

veterans' or Social Security claimants' back benefits,

9

respectively.

10

But then what Federal law also provides -

11

and the citations are Public Law 99-80 section 3 and

12

Public Law 102-572 section 506(c) -- Federal law

13

provides that to the extent that there is an EAJA fee,

14

the lawyer may not double-dip and has to send that fee

15

directly back to the client.

paralegal fee in third or in half or something like that

EAJA after its repeal, Congress again made clear -- and

this is the report that, Mr. Chief Justice, you were

referring to -- made clear that the "other expenses" of

5

EAJA fees includes an attorney's out-of-pocket expenses,

6

and that those out-of-pocket expenses were illustrated

7

by the specific example of paralegal time being

8

reimbursed at cost.

When Congress then re-enacted

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What is cost?

Could you

10

-- one could say I'm going to look at the Internet and

11

come up with $35 dollars an hour, or you could say in

12

the case of a paralegal there is a part of the overhead,

13

there is the fringe benefits -- so just giving the

14

hourly rate is deceptive of what the actual cost is to

15

the law firm, because the law firm has to add on to

16

determine what in fact it's paying for the paralegal,

17

the fringe benefits and part of the overhead.

18

MR. YANG:

Justice Ginsburg, the government

19

agrees that more than simply salary would be

20

reimbursable at cost.

to calculate cost in the context of paralegals would

cost for attorneys when the government seeks attorney's

potential situations.

think that firms would normally outsource their

Well in that case it would

bill the paralegal in the same way it would bill, I take

10

would bill the client dollar for dollar what it had to

pay.

It would -- it would -- I take it it

19

they don't add a profit on to -- to travel expenses and

20

things like that.

21

MR. YANG:

Right.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And -- so if that is so, in

23

each case cost means cost to the client, and you're

24

coming up with a new category of expense, which is cost

25

to someone else, and why should there be a subcategory
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of expense, in which cost does not mean cost to the

2

client when every other category of expense does mean

3

cost to the client?

4

MR. YANG:

Justice Souter, every other

5

category does not mean cost to the client.

6

EAJA specifically provides for fees, but the fees are

7

based on the prevailing market rates for similar

8

services.

9
10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In fact,

Because there is a separate

provision for fees.

11

MR. YANG:

That's correct, Your Honor.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MR. YANG:

Yes.

But in that context a client does

14

not incur any legal fees, have any obligation to pay any

15

fees, and courts routinely award EAJA fees when there

16

has been no cost to the client in fees, and similarly,

17

even if the client has an obligation to pay the cost in

18

those circumstances -- where for instance a firm is

19

providing pro bono services or a legal services

20

organization is providing pro bono services to a client,

21

the client does not have to incur or pay the costs.

22

The question is whether those costs have

23

been ultimately incurred and have been incurred at the

rate that the firm has incurred the cost on behalf of

the client.

Suppose you had independent firm of paralegals.

know whether the market contains them, but it surely

could.

then bill the law firm at their own hourly rate, and

a firm to outsource -

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But again, you're not

13

answering the hypothetical.

Let's assume two cases:

14

Case A, you hire an outside paralegal at $85 an hour.

15

He is outside, he is independent.

16

expert engineer in the Chief Justice question, $85 an

17

hour.

18

prevailing rate for which you charge general clients is

The

20

Why should there be a difference?

21

MR. YANG:

There should be a difference,

22

Your Honor, because with respect to outsourced firms,

23

there is no concern that a firm is going to add, well -

24

if the firm is only going to bill at its cost, the firm

25

is not going to add additional profit to the outsourced
34
Alderson Reporting Company

So if, for instance, a firm paid $85, under

3

our view the firm could not turn around and charge $95

to the client.

important under your context -

can't even charge $85 an hour.

Likewise -- and the reason that this is

MR. YANG:

Well, that's correct if their

cost, actual cost would be less in house.

And the

10

reason that's important is because in EAJA, unlike

11

section 1988, there are several statutory differences.

12

One, EAJA provides for other expenses, so the term

13

"attorney's fees" is not the only terms that needs to be

14

construed by the court.

15

construed in a manner that gives it meaningful effect.

16

Other expenses needs to be

And Congress recognized, again, in the

legislative history to the extent you could disagree on

the meaning of other expenses, Congress was very clear

19

both in 1980 and then again in 1984 that other expenses,

20

attorney's fees do not include things that attorneys pay

21

and only compensates attorneys for their own hourly

22

rate.

23

And the reason that the fee cap was

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I know you said that a

3

few times and you have authority for it, but it seems to

4

me odd if you look at 1988 and if the attorney's fees

5

and costs -- and costs is very limited in the statute in

6

1920 -- and if you have attorney's fees and other

7

expenses, other expenses is a much larger category than

8

costs within 1988.

9

EAJA is the more compensatory because it allows for more

10
11

So I -- I would think that, well,

items.
MR. YANG:

Justice Ginsburg, under Jenkins'

12

rationale, Jenkins recognized that when there is not

13

another -- another box of other expenses, where in a

14

statute which was intended to be fully compensatory,

15

that attorney's fees necessarily must include

16

compensation for all types of costs that a lawyer might

17

incur in the presentation/representation of a client.

18

That works for Section 1988.

19

But if that rationale were applied to the

20

EAJA context, if attorney's fees were given the same

21

meaning in EAJA, there is little or no work for other

22

expenses to be done in the statute, because already

23

you've pushed all of those expenses into the box of

24

MR. YANG:

Mr. Chief Justice, the reason

12

that you would adopt our construction is because

13

Congress is balancing more than the intent to provide

14

compensation for prevailing parties in EAJA.

15

also intending to balance the effect on the Federal fisc

16

and limit the government's exposure as a means of

17

passing the Act.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It was

It's kind of a

19

stretch to suggest in a situation where they pass a law

20

that only applies to individuals or small businesses

21

where they put a cap in and so on, that another way that

22

we are going to prevent damage to the fisc was to treat

23

paralegal expenses as costs rather than at market rate.

24

I suspect that was not foremost in their mind.

25

MR. YANG:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think

the legislative history illustrates that, in fact,

And that, I

Well, the relevant page of the

legislative history in 1984 that you're talking about

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do we know what the

President's view was on that question when he signed the

legislation into law, which is what he was required to

2

do before it became law and which he did not do under

3

the prior bill?

4

MR. YANG:

The President did not express a

5

view, but what we do know is that the legislative

6

history in 1984 dealt with language that was identical

7

to that ultimately passed by the Senate -- by Congress

8

and signed by the President.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean that wouldn't be

6

surprising would it, that wouldn't be surprising because

7

you have, in fact, very complex bills that have 14

8

sections and section of the B bill could have been

vetoed -- been vetoed because of problem with Section 14

10

and repassed without Section 14, in which case the

11

legislative history for the other 13 sections would be

12

highly illuminating as to what they mean.

13

MR. YANG:

In fact Congress recognized that,

14

Justice Breyer, when it re-enacted -- when it

15

readdressed the bill in 1985, the relative legislative

16

history specifically references the bill that existed

17

before that it was reported by -

JUSTICE BREYER:

The question that I had in

19

respect to this statute is -- is that my impression and

20

here -- I'd like to know how they bill secretary's

21

times.

22

thought is -- and I want to be either verified or told

23

I'm wrong and explain it, that when you have no cap, the

24

lawyer and the client want to shove everything possible

25

into the rubric attorney's fees, including the kitchen

3

(Laughter.)

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

That's fine.

No problem.

There is no other way to get paid for them.

6

But where you have a cap, you should shove

7

everything the other side, if expenses are going to be

8

paid for it, because that cap means that the lawyer will

9

not get his full pay back and therefore, the lower the

10

cap, the more you want to be sure it's covering only

11

that lawyer's time.

12

expense so that you can pay the lawyer adequately and he

13

will recover his expenses elsewhere.

14

And everything else goes into

Was that the theory of this bill?

15

any evidence that that was the theory?

16

that way, would anything get mixed up?

17

MR. YANG:

Is there

If you did it

Well, the theory of the bill was

18

that attorney's fees would be based at prevailing market

19

rates, and that prevailing market rates would embody a

20

certain set of costs that might be reimbursed.

21

think that the prevailing practice is not to bill

22

separately for the kitchen sink, but as the Court

23

explained in Missouri versus Jenkins, Missouri's

24

analysis would extend to your hypothetical, Justice

25

Breyer.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

language first came in -- this is in relation to Justice

the Senate report, which was the first:

And when Congress did that, it specifically

10

recognized that it was taking a different approach than

11

that taken in other fee-shifting statutes.

12

next sentence explains that the committee notes that

13

this section is not intended to limit or affect the

14

computation of reasonable attorney's fees under any

15

other provision of law, and gave as an example the Civil

16

Rights Act.

17

The very

That is section 1988.
So Congress knew from the very beginning

18

that its treatment of attorney's fees as being limited

19

only to attorneys and the larger more capacious category

20

of other expenses, capturing all other costs that an

21

attorney might incur in the representation of a client

This was in 1984.
At that time were they

5

billing paralegal's fees at cost to the client?

6

it -

7

MR. YANG:

Was

In fact, Your Honor, there was a

8

dispute that the legislative history speaks to the

9

controversy that evolved regarding the -- whether other

10

expenses of the term would include more than what was

11

specifically enumerated in the statute.

12

cite to in our brief as a footnote at page 28, footnote

13

12, there was a dispute.

14

that paralegals were reimbursed at cost.

15

16

specifically references -- concluded that it was costs

17

to the attorney, as this Court recognized in Jenkins.

18

Footnote seven of Jenkins discusses the Northcross

to the attorney.

And so, when you take that controversy which

with Congress' statement that it intended to compensate

1

out-of-pocket expenses incurred with connection to a

2

case, the model rules and Northcross when you combine

3

that with the statement that paralegals are to be

4

compensated at cost, seems clear to us that Congress is

5

intending that in contrast to attorney's fees, which

6

have a profit element embedded in them and a profit

7

element capped by the fee cap that Congress imposed in

8

1980 -- that when read together, it seems fairly clear

9

to us that Congress intended -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

11

reimbursed at cost has a profit element in it for

12

whoever performed the service.

But when it's within the control

of the firm -

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- within the control of the

firm, there is a particular danger that the firm can

inflate its own costs.

20

profits.

Whereas when it's going out to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, maybe this is

the same question Justice Breyer asked, but I haven't -

I didn't grasp the answer.

make sense for lawyers to charge separately for

25

photocopy services, telephone services, so on because

Under your system it would

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

then they are not going to be subject to the attorney

fee cap.

between cost and market rate is relatively small; the

difference between our hourly rate and $125 is large.

And they may think, look, the difference

5

MR. YANG:

incentives that firms might have.

7

You're asking about the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I'm just

8

saying if we adopt your position, isn't it going to be,

9

I guess, worse for your client because firms will, as

10

I've been told firms sometimes do, charge separately for

11

things at a higher rate than their cost?

12

charge higher rate for photocopy services because they

13

try to factor into it overhead and things like than

14

15

MR. YANG:

Overhead profit.

They will

We don't

16

believe it's actually going to change any practices,

17

because ultimately, when you're looking at what costs

18

are reimbursable under EAJA, it has to be costs that are

19

not traditionally already paid for in the attorney's

20

fees.

21

specific firm that's at issue, you have to look at the

22

prevailing practice.

23

So you have to look not to the practice of the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I would say -

24

I would say that it's now traditional for firms to

25

charge, say, more for their photocopy services than it
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

cost them.
MR. YANG:

Well, if that's the case under

3

our reading, of course, we would -- we would say that

4

that is -- that is not a type of expense that was

5

contemplated by EAJA, because Congress already provided

6

for profits that attorneys get from representing a party

7

within the attorney fee and cap that.

8
9

The whole idea of a cap is to limit the
reimbursement that a firm might get from EAJA below what

10

the prevailing market rates for the services would be.

11

If the -- the prevailing market rates were below the

12

cap, the cap never comes into play.

13

that cap is to limit compensation below market rates.

14

And it would be anomalous to allow -

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

to expenses, does it?

17

MR. YANG:

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19
20

The only reason for

But the cap doesn't apply

I didn't catch you.
The cap does not apply to

reimbursement expenses at cost?
MR. YANG:

Precisely, because in our view

21

expenses are at cost and it is not -- you don't have the

22

same danger of having firms imbedding profit within

23

their own rate.

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It seems to me just the

opposite just as the Chief Justice suggests.
48
Alderson Reporting Company

It seems

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to me you're creating an incentive for the firms to -

2

to charge as much as they can -- I mean, under market

3

rates for everything under the -- under the time of the

4

lawyer himself.

5

MR. YANG:

But again, and under our view if

6

they were to -- if a firm were to charge, say, 50 cents

7

for a photocopy and it only cost 10 or 15 cents for that

8

photocopy, under our view the firm would only be

9

reimbursed for our for the 15 cents.

10
11

The not an

incentive to bill the client for anything more JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, because other costs

12

reasonably interpret to include overhead.

13

the paper and the accounting time.

14

MR. YANG:

It's not just

Overhead, we don't believe, is

15

fairly attributable to a particular case.

16

Congress was specific about this particular point on

17

overhead in the legislative history.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And, in fact,

Well, I think you

19

missed my point.

20

and they can only charge 15 cents, they have an

21

incentive to separately charge for photocopying, because

22

they get the 15 cents, and otherwise it's going to -

23

they are going to lose it over the cap if you say no

24

that's part of the attorney's fees.

25

It was even if you're right, 50 cents

MR. YANG:

I guess you're right to some
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

extent there would be incentive to shift out costs even

2

though there would be less of an incentive than shifting

3

out costs plus profit.

4

the -- the reason that we think that that's a bit

5

different is because, again, Congress intended for the

6

profit making part of a -- an attorney's compensation to

7

come out of attorney's fees, and then are capped.

8

there is very little incentive to -- to shift out fees

9

unless the market itself is already doing that.

But the reason that -- that

And

And if

10

the market itself is already billing for photocopies,

11

then that's what you're going to get.

12

didn't separately charge for photocopies as part of your

rate, you could bill under EAJA.

providing for photocopies being billed separately, you

can simply submit a request for photocopies.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'd like to go back to a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question that Justice Kennedy asked of Mr. Wolfman.

2

Isn't there -- doesn't it make sense to take a word like

3

"attorney's fees" and like the word "discrimination," we

4

have many different anti-discrimination statutes, but

5

there has been an attempt to give that word

6

"discrimination" the same meaning in all those statutes.

7

And here the term attorney's fees, if it means that

8

includes all of them, in terms of 1988, why not say

9

every time attorney's fees comes up, that's what it's

10
11

going to mean?
MR. YANG:

As a general rule, in

12

fee-shifting statutes that are like Section 1988, that

13

is in fact the rule.

14

are given a similar meaning readily yields when there is

15

indication that Congress did not intend the same to

16

apply here, and in fact for instance in the Fogerty

17

versus Fantasy case, the Court specifically rejected the

18

approach of adopting the understanding of reasonable

19

attorney's fees applied in other fee-shifting statutes,

20

because it found that the policy and legislative history

21

of the Copyright Act required or at least suggested that

22

Congress intended something else.

23

But the rule that similar words

And here, not only do we have a different

legislative history, we have fundamentally different

Here's what it says.
It says that:

If you look at -- and this

That's the situation today with paralegal

22

Then it's true that the ACUS, the

23

administrative conference, did not issue a hard and fast

24

rule with respect to paralegal expenses.

course is because the market wasn't uniform at that time

paralegal services are -- are separately billed.

listen to what the court said --said:

4

decline to issue because, quote, "practices with respect

5

to charging clients for paralegal time vary depending on

6

locality and field of practice."

Today it's nearly ubiquitous that

replicate prevailing practices in the market.

Now let me just end by -- by -- on this

note.

If, there is also the question raised about

whether you should give any weight to this -- this

report at all.

reasons, essentially in Justice Scalia's last question

16

on that topic; but we do -- we do talk about why the

17

Jean decision use of that report does not wear the

18

weight that the government gives us, and that's on pages

19

13 and 14 of our brief, our reply brief.

20

is, is because in Jean, no one brought to the Court's

21

attention in any of the briefs the problem that the -

that legislative history accompanied vetoed legislation.

It was never brought to the Court's attention.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but I think

2

Justice Breyer is correct, isn't he, that there was no

3

reason for the Senate to sort of redo a report that they

4

had already done on a bill that was substantially

5

identical?

6

MR. WOLFMAN:

That might be true in some

7

circumstances, but that's not what happened in 1985.

8

There was an extensive House report accompanying that

9

legislation.

The House

report -

11
12

There was no Senate report.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There was no Senate

report because they had done it just the previous year.

13

MR. WOLFMAN:

I think not, Your Honor.

14

There were some other things taken up in the House

15

report and the House report, quite extensive, says

16

nothing; it's silent on the question of paralegal

17

services.

18
19

Look, let me just say as I close -- may I
answer the question?

20

Let me just say as I close that -- that if

21

the Court wishes to look at that report, at the very

22

best for the government, it's a wash.
