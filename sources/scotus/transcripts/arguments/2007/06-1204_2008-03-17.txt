ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

This case concerns a dispute over the

12

ownership of the property, the Arelma assets, that the

13

Republic of the Philippines believes were stolen by

14

Ferdinand Marcos while he served as the Republic's

15

president.

16

settled by the courts of the Republic.

17

assets were stolen in the Philippines, from the

18

Philippine people, by their former president.

20

its citizens.

13

president Marcos.

transferred from Switzerland to be held in escrow in the

15

Philippines, the Philippine Supreme Court in 2003 issued

16

a judgment relating to those assets because there was

17

some doubt as to whether that judgment, some question

18

about whether that judgment specifically addressed the

19

Arelma assets that are at issue here, the Republic filed

20

a motion before the Sandiganbayan in 2004 directed

21

specifically at the assets.

22

since that time.

That's right.
Said that it had no

16

good thing for the Philippines that that litigation go

judgment would be uncollectible because all of those

assets belonged to the Philippine Government and not to

20

Marcos's estate, so the -- that whole litigation would

21

have been an exercise in futility.

22

In fact, he thought it was a

victims of the Marcos regime bringing suit in the United

2

States and they had no -- the Republic had no objection

3

to the suit proceeding in this country.

4

the issue that was before the court that the Republic

5

weighed in on was whether the act of state doctrine

6

would preclude adjudication in the United States.

7

Republic's interest was in making clear that the acts of

8

Marcos were not the acts of the Republic, they were not

9

official acts that the Republic was prepared to defend.

10

Specifically

The

The Republic did not then and does not now

11

have any objection to citizens of the Republic

12

proceeding in the courts of the United States against

13

the estate of Marcos.

14

not these assets are in the estate of Marcos.

15

Republic's submission is that these assets belong to the

16

Republic, that they have never been part of the Marcos

17

estate, and that therefore these are sort of ships

18

passing in the night, that there can be proceedings

19

against the estate in this country or elsewhere.

20
21
22

The question here is whether or

The

Is there anything else in

the estate?
MR. ROTHFELD:

There is litigation going on

23

in the Philippines now before the Sandiganbayan as to

24

what is in the estate, and I think that one of the

25

problems, of course, is that, as is true of many corrupt

regimes that have misappropriated state assets,

2

unraveling it is enormously complicated.

3

dummy corporations, there were smell corporations, which

4

is one of the reasons that it has taken so long.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There were

Well, let me ask a slightly

6

different question from Justice Scalia's.

7

position of the Philippine Government that there are any

8

assets in the estate that the Philippine Government does

9

not claim?

10

MR. ROTHFELD:

11

12

number of assets.

13

Is it the

I think that there are some

I will not say that they are very substantial
Now, I should say -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Enough assets to satisfy

14

the claims of the individuals who -- who brought suit in

15

the United States?

16
17
18

MR. ROTHFELD:

No, there are not and there

may never have been.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

So the position of the

19

Philippines, going back to Justice Ginsburg's question,

20

was we have no objection and in fact I think it was we

21

support the litigation in the United States, but when it

22

comes time to collect a judgment we're claiming they

23

don't get a penny because everything belongs to us.

24

that a fair summary of the Philippines' position?

25

MR. ROTHFELD:

I think that is not an
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

entirely fair summary, Your Honor.

2

again let me say that there are two separate questions:

3

One is whether or not, as a matter of principle, the

4

Philippines objected to its citizens proceeding in the

5

courts of the United States to condemn the regime of

6

former President Marcos.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:
suing to condemn the regime.

9

declaratory judgment.

11

and

Well, they weren't just

8

10

I think --

They weren't asking for a

They were asking for a judgment

in money.
MR. ROTHFELD:

That is true, Your Honor.

12

But the submission -- and the question is whether there

13

is some inconsistency between what the Republic said

14

then and what it says now.

15

that the claimants were entitled to recover assets that

16

belonged to the Republic.

17

whatever ended up in the Marcos estate -

18

The submission then was not

The submission was that

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but we live in a

19

practical world and if in fact there were no apparent

20

assets that might satisfy that judgment that the

21

Philippine Government did not claim, then their -- then

22

their support of the -- of the earlier litigation was at

23

the very least in tension with their -- with their

24

overall position.

25

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think that that 9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

again, I would respectfully disagree with that.

I think

2

that there was real meaning to the judgment that was

3

returned here even if there is a dispute as to whether

4

there are assets in the Marcos estate.

5

settlements worked out between the Marcos estate and the

6

claimants, with the blessing of the Republic, that would

7

have paid a very substantial amount out of assets

8

recovered from the Marcos -- that were associated with

9

Marcos, recovered by the Republic, and the Republic sort

There were two

10

of blessed payment of those to the claimants here.

11

Ultimately that was vetoed by the Sandiganbayan as

12

inconsistent with Philippine law.

13

executive branch -

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I think that the

Then why doesn't the

15

Republic take the position that, because that was vetoed

16

for reasons apart from the Republic's discretion, that

17

the current assets would be an appropriate source of

18

payment?

19

MR. ROTHFELD:

There have been a number of

20

efforts in the Philippine Congress, and there is now

21

pending bills in the Philippine Congress, to compensate

22

the claimants in amounts equivalent to those

23

settlements.

24

could happen, but I think it's important to step back

25

and say, what is the issue before this Court here?

So I think that that is something that

10
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I think all of these considerations are simply divorced

2

from the Rule 19 issues.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's one other point

4

of Philippine law that's unclear from the briefs.

5

Respondents say they have no right to intervene in the

6

proceeding that's going on before the corruption court

7

and your brief suggests that there is a right to

8

intervene.

9

litigation or will they not be heard by the corruption

10

What is it?

The

Can they become part of that

court?

11

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, we quoted the relevant

12

portion of Philippine law, which is equivalent to our

13

permissive intervention, which would have permitted the

14

claimants to seek to intervene in the proceeding of the

15

Sandiganbayan.

16
17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Seek to intervene, but no

right to intervene?

18
19

In fact -

MR. ROTHFELD:

It is not a matter of right;

it is permissive intervention.

20

I think it's important to bear in mind the

21

status of the claimants, though, because they're -

22

their rights are entirely derivative of the Marcos

23

estate.

24

the subject of this here before this Court.

25

Marcos estate is held to have no right to those assets,

They don't claim the Arelma assets, which are

11
Alderson Reporting Company

If the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they have no right at all and they have no rights to be

2

protected.

3

So I think it's -- it is important to

4

retreat to the questions that are actually before this

5

Court now about the meaning of Rule 19 and its

6

application in a situation in which there is an absent

7

sovereign that has asserted its sovereign immunity.

8

--

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

Could you address that?

10

That is the issue.

11

question of where a party is just entitled to plead

12

inconsistent theories?

13

Why is it that the Philippines can come into court and

14

say, "we have sovereign immunity, and therefore the suit

15

must be dismissed"?

16

point?

17

Sovereign immunity, is this a

Was this a special appearance?

Would you just address that basic

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think that that's -

18

sovereign immunity and dismissal under Rule 19 are two

19

different but closely related and essential aspects of

20

the relief of the Republic.

21

sovereign immunity, all agree at this point that it

22

cannot be forced to appear in this proceeding.

23

As a matter of the

But that relief is of little good to the

24

Republic if the assets are then going to be awarded by a

2

its interest, its sovereign immunity, to make it -- to

3

effectuate it -- that the action be dismissed under Rule

4

19.

5

has recognized that when there is a sovereign that

6

cannot be brought into the litigation and the

7

sovereign's interests are going to be substantially

8

undermined, the sovereign is an indispensable party and

9

dismissal is essentially automatic.

And I think that it is something which this Court

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, let me amend your

20

question in one respect.

21

course as in their -- in their capacity as a party, they

22

sought dismissal under Rule 19 as well as dismissal of

23

themselves on sovereign immunity grounds.

24

specifically -

25

They were a party and of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
13
Alderson Reporting Company

But to answer

I guess they weren't

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there for the adjudication on the merits.

2

MR. ROTHFELD:

They were not there for the

3

adjudication of the merits, that's right, because they

4

had asserted their sovereign immunity.

5

I think that there -- everyone agrees, the

6

Ninth Circuit itself acknowledged, that once the assets

7

here are disbursed to Respondent and to the plaintiff

8

class, as a practical matter they will be beyond

9

recapture.

There is a class of almost 10,000 people.

10

And when the assets are gone, to reclaim them, even if

11

the Sandiganbayan rules next week that Arelma is now and

12

always has been the property of the Republic, it will be

13

as a practical matter impossible to get them back.

14

One suggestion which is made by Respondent

15

and by some of its amici is that, because the Republic

16

is not bound here, it could bring an action against the

17

former stakeholder of these assets, Merrill Lynch.

18

That, I think, is also clearly an inadequate remedy for

19

the Republic.

20

able to proceed in such a proceeding sort of

21

unencumbered by the judgment here.

22

looking for under Rule 19 -- again, there are sort of

23

two components to this:

24

component, which we think is essentially a per se rule

25

requiring dismissal in circumstances here.

There is no guarantee that it would be

If we get beyond that and we say, under Rule

2

19 what are the interests that we want to advance, the

3

principal interest of Rule 19 is that everything gets

4

accommodated in a single proceeding, that this gets

5

resolved by the whole, as the Court has described it,

6

and the only way to accomplish that is dismissal of this

7

suit.

8

that the Republic is an indispensable party in

9

litigation relating to Arelma will be binding on all the

11

12

future, that action will be dismissed unless or until

the Republic chooses.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

That will mean that if

Would you agree that the

15

Republic is ultimately not going to be able to collect

16

these funds unless it sues in the United States and

17

waives its immunity in that suit?

18

that relevant to the question of whether it should have

19

been forced to proceed in this action?

20

MR. ROTHFELD:

And is that -- is

Well, I don't think it's

21

directly relevant, but I think that if one looks at the

22

bigger picture, it is true -- if the Republic -- if this

23

action is dismissed, the Sandiganbayan rules, and let's

24

say that it rules for the Republic, the Republic becomes

25

the owner of Arelma.

It is then in a position to go to
15

Merrill Lynch and say:

This is our account; give it to

2

us.

3

the Republic will have to seek judicial action in the

4

United States, but at that point it will be seeking to

5

enforce a judgment of the Sandiganbayan.

It --

the

6

proceeding there will be an enforcement action.

And

But that's inconsistent with

Well, is it -- is it

16

fair to the private claimants here in the United States

17

to say, wait until the Philippine court renders a

judgment in favor of the Philippines, and then they can

19

come in and enforce the judgment against Merrill Lynch

20

or whomever is holding the assets?

21

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think if the

22

Sandiganbayan rules for the Republic, the assets are the

23

Republic's assets.

24
25

The Republic can seek -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, under the

determination of the Philippine court.

But the court

assets, as it did.

Well, it did without the

participation of the Philippines.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you just told

6

me that the Philippines court may judge the opposite

7

without the participation of the private claimants.

8
9

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, but the -- but again,

Your Honor, it's important to remember the private

10

claimants have no claim to the Arelma assets.

11

interest is entirely derivative of the Marcos estate.

12

The estate -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Their

That seems to me to

14

be an argument on the merits, rather than with respect

15

to which case should proceed first.

16

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, it goes, I think, to

17

the question of whether their claim is one which is

18

entitled to be heard in the United States.

19

is, when the Sandiganbayan decides this case as between

20

the two claimants that actually claim ownership of

21

Arelma, as opposed to derivative rights as to one or the

22

other of the claimants, that is the way in which it

23

makes sense to proceed:

24

as between these two claimants, the Republic and the

estate.

brought here, on the ground that they were not allowed

5

to participate in the proceeding in the Philippines?

6

MR. ROTHFELD:

probably not, Your Honor, because again their interests

are entirely derivative of the Marcos estate.

No, I do not suggest any

connection between them.

because their interest is entirely derivative of the

interest there, and therefore somebody is there

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

12

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

13

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

14

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

I

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
When a sovereign government cannot be made a

18

party to a case because of its immunity from suit, that

19

fact must be given great weight in determining whether

20

the suit nonetheless may proceed.

21

the absent sovereign is the United States, one of the 50

22

States, an Indian tribe or, as here, a foreign state.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That is true whether

When you say "great

24

weight," Mr. Kneedler, then you are not agreeing with

25

Mr. Rothfeld, who says it's automatic?

MR. KNEEDLER:

We believe it would be

2

dispositive in most cases, we think, only if the

3

sovereign's interests would be adequately protected by

4

the judgment or in the rare case that we've identified

5

in our brief where the sovereign's interests are

6

adequately protected by another sovereign, in the case

7

of an Indian tribe being protected by the United States.

8
9

But other than that, or where the United
States is in a case against a state, the United States

10

being the national sovereign, there could be special

11

circumstances, but we think as a whole, the -- as a

12

general rule, sovereign immunity controls.

13

because sovereign immunity represents a fundamental

14

policy judgment either rooted in the Constitution for

15

the United States or the States, or judgments of the

16

legislative branches that the sovereign should not be

17

required to appear in court.

18

And that's

A contrary rule allowing the suit to proceed

19

would effectively undermine that rule of immunity and

20

allow the sovereign's interest to be tried behind its

21

back.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But suppose a case -- and

23

you have to do a lot of supposing.

24

Philippine Government was simply not amenable to the

25

process of the court, not because of foreign immunity,

2

where process ran.

3

Exactly the same analysis as here?

4

It just can't be made a party.

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think that's probably

5

correct if the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act governs

6

the service of process under the Act, and if the -

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I understand, but in my

8

hypothetical case it's just as if somebody is at the

9

North Pole and you can't serve them.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

But if the sovereign

11

-- if the foreign sovereign can't be sued, I think it's

12

all the more -- I mean it can't even be reached -- it

13

may be all the more reason why that interest should be

14

given weight.

15

We think the sovereign interest in this case

16

is particularly compelling for reasons that have already

17

been stated.

18

that it owns these assets.

19

are unsecured judgment creditors.

20

Philippines claims it owns these, these assets, under a

21

special Philippine statute dating to 1955 that declares

22

ill-gotten gains gained toward -- during time in office,

23

forfeit to the government, and it has a strong interest

24

in having that dispute resolved in its own courts.

they're certainly subject to Philippine law, and I

Alderson Reporting Company

1

understand that there's no dispute that under Philippine

2

law the assets would be taken from the Philippine

3

National Bank for the benefit of the government.

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's true, but the

5

interests of the Philippine Government in obtaining -

6

in having its interest confirmed that it owns these

7

assets as of the time of the wrongdoing going back to

8

1972, that interest would not be advanced by PNB because

9

PNB is holding them in escrow depending -- pending the

10

outcome of that very dispute between the Marcoses and

11

the Philippine Government and couldn't be expected to

12

advance in this case the Government of the Philippines'

13

interest or claim of ownership to those assets.

14

One other international agreement I wanted

15

to mention was the Convention Against Corruption, to

16

which the United States is a party.

17

statute passed by Congress, 2467, that provides for

18

forfeiture in the United States of assets that are

19

deemed to be forfeited pursuant to a foreign proceeding.

20

So international agreements -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And also there is a

Doesn't that depend on

22

there being a foreign judgment, which we don't have in

23

this case?

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

We -- we don't have it yet,

but that -- that reflects the important interest of
23
Alderson Reporting Company

1

having our courts stay their hands pending the outcome

2

of the proceedings in the Philippines in which that

3

would be determined.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't it also a

5

requirement that in that proceeding in the foreign

6

nation that all claimants would have an opportunity to

7

be heard, which is not true here?

8
9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, what -- what the

statute requires is that the foreign proceedings be in

10

accordance with due process and that parties claiming an

11

Again, the claimants here do not claim an

14

They are unsecured judgment creditors of the

16

think about what is true in the reverse situation, in

17

the forfeiture proceeding brought by the United States

18

in U.S. courts against a criminal defendant, for

19

example.

20

defendant claiming the assets is typically found not

21

even to have standing to intervene.

22

23

the United States because it wouldn't be a bona fide

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Kneedler, may I ask

2

you this question:

3

were secured creditors rather than judgment creditors?

4

Would the case be different if there

MR. KNEEDLER:

In -- in U.S. courts a

5

secured creditor would get past the standing stage, but

6

would not -- would not get past the bona fide purchaser

7

for value without knowledge of the wrongdoing.

8
9

In this case it has been clear since 1986,
for example, that the Government of the Philippines has

10

-- has been seeking the repatriation of Arelma and its

11

assets.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it's been doing it on

13

a fairly sporadic basis.

If I remember the facts

14

correctly, first it got a stay with respect to the

15

disposition of assets, and then the stay expired and the

16

government didn't do anything about it, and then the

17

government didn't come into action again until this

18

particular claim was raised.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I think it -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

sort of my response in the form of a question.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I -- perhaps in an

2

extreme case, but I -- first of all, I think the courts

3

of the United States should be very reluctant to deem a

4

foreign government's conduct inequitable in the sense

5

that you're describing it.

6

Mr. Rothfeld said, repatriating these assets is an

7

extremely complicated thing.

8

Government sought these assets in -- beginning in 1986,

9

obtained a freeze order in 1986, again in 1990.

And I think, for the reasons

But the Philippines

It got

10

a final determination by the district attorney in

11

Switzerland in 1995, confirmed by the federal court of

12

Switzerland in 1997, that the assets could be returned.

13

These assets, the shares, the Arelma shares, however,

14

were not actually returned until 2000 by the Swiss

15

Government.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there any explanation

17

why the freeze that was imposed by a U.S. court in 1987

18

was simply allowed to lapse?

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

That was the preliminary

20

injunction and I'm not sure what happened after that.

21

But I did want -- the proceedings in Switzerland, I did

22

want to make clear, because there was a suggestion that

23

the Philippine Government was duplicitous by encouraging

24

this suit and at the same time seeking the assets.

as I just pointed out.

But

real-world practical terms, the claim to these assets

appropriate for these people to proceed in the United

12

States for a money judgment, are at least in some

13

tension with each other, aren't they?

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

I do not believe so.

If we

15

thought about an analogy at the United States, if the

16

United States filed a brief in this Court saying that a

17

former Government official could be sued, did not have

18

qualified immunity and could be sued in his personal

19

capacity, or didn't -- or could be sued individually and

20

the Westfall Act did not protect him, that would in no

way make -- be a representation by the United States

that a judgment against that officer could be satisfied

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

17

MR. SWIFT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to address as a first point the

18

issue you raise, which is perhaps seminal to you, and

19

that is whether there is an adequate alternative remedy

20

to the human rights victims, either in the United States

21

or in the Philippines.

22

there is no remedy.

23

Our answer is, unequivocally,

Let me talk about the Philippines first.

25

Its supreme court has so declared.

Alderson Reporting Company

These assets are in

the United States.

that share in rem assets.

3

There cannot be two jurisdictions

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, doesn't the -- maybe

4

this makes no difference, but doesn't the Philippine

5

National Bank have the -- whatever they call them, the

6

share certificates or stock certificates that represent

7

the Arelma assets at this point?

8
9
10

MR. SWIFT:

That's right.

Switzerland

confiscated those certificates from a Swiss financier
and transferred them to the Philippines.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

Couldn't they -

12

couldn't they bring an in rem in the Philippines based

13

on the presence in the Philippines of those two

14

certificates?

15
16

MR. SWIFT:

They can, and that's in fact

what is occurring.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

18

MR. SWIFT:

Okay.

However, it's also apparent from

19

the facts in this case that those certificates were

20

never the property of the Philippine Government, never,

21

ever.

22

in the joint appendix on that, which makes the whole

23

issue -

24
25

There is absolute clear evidence in this record,

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought the issue in the

Philippines is the question of whether the money that
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

went into the stock certificates eventually belonged to

2

the people of the Philippines from the beginning or

3

belonged to Marcos personally?

4

MR. SWIFT:

Well, that's -

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

And you're saying that

6

there's no possibility whatsoever that a Philippine

7

court could say that this money initially belonged to

8

the people of the Philippines?

9
10
11

MR. SWIFT:

They could not say that in a

forfeiture proceeding because JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm saying whether they -

12

I don't care what the name of the proceeding is.

13

saying could they decide that?

14

MR. SWIFT:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm

Yes, sir, absolutely.
All right.

Now, if they

16

decide that, why should your clients, terribly treated

17

as they were, get the money ahead of the victims in the

18

Philippines, who also were terribly treated?

19
20
21

MR. SWIFT:

Because the judgment in the

Philippines would not be in rem, Mr. Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought Justice Souter

22

just answered that.

He said that the stock certificates

23

might be held to belong to the people of the

24

Philippines, in which case the stock certificates

25

represent stock in a company that has a claim against
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Merrill Lynch, and so they will say, this certificate

2

belongs to the people of the Philippines; the people of

3

the Philippines would like you, Merrill Lynch, to pay

4

back the money that the company gave them initially.

5

And Merrill Lynch I imagine would pay it.

6

think is as I understand it.

7

with my understanding?

8

MR. SWIFT:

9

Now that I

Is there something wrong

I think your understanding is

correct in that regard; however, the law both in the

10

Philippines and in the United States draws a clear

11

distinction between the ownership of stock and a

12

corporation's ownership of assets.

13

Patrickson stands for that proposition.

14

Certainly Dole v.

The -- a judgment rendered as to the

15

certificates in the Philippines or even as to the assets

16

would not be in rem.

17

the United States to be enforced, they would stand in

18

the same position as any other judgment creditor, not a

19

judgment creditor with a claim to specific assets, but a

20

judgment creditor as to a specific amount of money.

21
22
23

So if that judgment came over to

Let me answer another question which was
asked JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I would like you to

24

address -- you seem to put heavy weight on this in rem

25

characterization.

That is a judgment there's a thing.
31
Alderson Reporting Company

But our law over the years has come to appreciate that

2

things do not have rights; people have rights in things.

3

So we have modified the once rigid notion that the suit

5

rights in the thing that count.

6

label seems to forget about all the more recent

understanding.

And your use of that

nature of a proceeding.

In fact, it was the best and

most appropriate and the only proceeding in which all

14

answer.

That's correct.

The other two,

20

to create those had been taken from the Philippine

people unlawfully, if that's what they decide, at that

point the owner of the certificates, the government,

question, though.

Philippine Government now makes, or then, makes a new

request that was refused in 2000, which may be too late

to sue on, isn't going to prevent them from suing on

their present adjudication that they are the true owners

of the share certificates and want the money.

But I believe there is an

important part of the equation that's left out of that

10

question, and that is the rights of the Philippine

11

government as the new shareholder will not be any

12

greater than those of the prior shareholder.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

The prior

You're saying -- I

15

think you're saying that the demand would be ineffectual

16

this time for the same reason it was ineffectual the

17

last time.

18

MR. SWIFT:

Yes, Your Honor.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And the suggestion I

20

thought that Justice Breyer had made and that I made was

21

this time they can do something further.

the judgment and go into a United States court and say:

We've got this judgment, there's no question that these

24

shares and what they represent are ours; so make Merrill

25

Lynch give us the money.

They can take

What prevents them from doing
37

Alderson Reporting Company

that?

2

MR. SWIFT:

Nothing prevents them from

3

making the demand.

4

for that, first of all, Merrill Lynch can do what it did

5

here, which is to file an interpleader and say:

6

all the claimants to come forth and make the claim.

7

Then we have a redo.

8
9

But when they go into court and ask

We want

What we have below is a judgment, a judgment
that we're seeking to enforce and we contend that -

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, the difference in

11

the redo is that in the second case that's just been

12

hypothesized, the Philippine government is represented.

13

We are making these assumptions, and the Philippines

14

government says:

15

they may very well be wrong; we want to be represented

16

before you make those assumptions.

17

MR. SWIFT:

You can make these assumptions, but

Well, they had that right in the

18

year 2000 when they chose to exercise their sovereign

19

immunity.

20

waive their sovereign immunity to go -

21

So, what has changed?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They would have to

Any party that's beyond

22

the process of the court has a right to come in.

23

question is what happens if they are not there.

MR. SWIFT:
They chose to exit.

The

They then paid for the prosecution

of claims by PNB and Arelma, in effect acting as

2

surrogate, reflective of a question that was asked

3

earlier.

4

result, they then want to use PNB and Arelma to upset

5

that pursuant to a Rule 19(b) motion.

6

Then when they were dissatisfied with the

JUSTICE BREYER:

There is a huge change.

7

The change would be that they'd a judgment of that

8

special court over there that this company and the

9

assets understandably belong to us, not to the Marcoses.

10

And so this time, they go with that judgment to Merrill

11

Lynch and say:

12

Give us the money.

And if they -- if they don't -- if Merrill

13

Lynch says no -- Merrill Lynch might say yes, but you'll

14

say, no, it belongs to us, so they might not.

15

they don't, then the Philippines are never going to get

16

the money, unless they bring the lawsuit.

17

bring the lawsuit, then you have them, because then you

18

go right into the court in that lawsuit and intervene

19

and they have waived all their sovereign immunity, et

20

cetera, they can't get the money.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But isn't that what -

2

that's what sovereign immunity means.

I mean, they do

3

have the right to pick their forum.

4

be sued when I consent, so I can consent where I will.

5

The problem with what you're presenting is

You say I can only

6

it sounds like, yes, you have sovereign immunity, you

7

don't have to be part of this lawsuit and it can't

8

affect your rights, but then when it seems to be

9

eventual judgment, it's a default judgment effectively

10

against the Philippines, because they can never get

11

those assets once they're disbursed.

12

kind of a deceptive immunity, because by asserting the

13

immunity they are going to lose their opportunity to

14

claim these assets.

15

MR. SWIFT:

So, it's a -- it's

16

suggesting is that there should be a per se rule under

There could be others.

Well, then we have two lower

22

courts that have balanced and weighed all appropriate

23

factors.

There is no suggesting that there are other

24

factors.

They -- I believe that the standard of review

25

for this Court is whether or not the lower courts
40
Alderson Reporting Company

considered the factors and engaged in an appropriate

2

balancing and weighing -

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In making that balancing,

4

what weight did they give to the sovereign immunity of

5

the Philippines?

6

MR. SWIFT:

Significant weight.

The Ninth

Circuit said it was a powerful factor.

8

into other factors, some of which Justice Ginsburg

9

mentioned:

10

The 22-year delay.

And then it went

They have known about

this for a long time.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that the Ninth

12

Circuit went on a statute of limitations in New York.

13

It didn't give the sovereign immunity claim, it seems,

14

in the end of the day any weight, because it says we

15

don't have to worry about the Philippines being out of

16

this case because they would have no claim on the

17

merits.

18

MR. SWIFT:

Let me pose a different example

19

to you, Justice Ginsburg, and that is, what if this were

20

a bankruptcy proceeding and the foreign sovereign said:

21

Oh, those assets really belong to us, they were stolen,

22

It has, based on evidence, based

on depositions, that these assets belonged to Marcos.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where is that?

Then why

6

were they bothering with the statute of limitations?

7

Both courts said that the action would be time barred in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I just did not find in

either the district court or the court of appeals an

14

answer to that basic question:

15

It seemed to me they were assuming the assets belonged

16

to the estate and not to the Philippine Government, but

17

they made no specific finding on that issue.

18

MR. SWIFT:

Whose assets are they?

There are a number of findings,

19

but obviously, because the Philippine Government was not

20

a party in the case, there was no finding specific to

21

the Philippine Government.

22

were -- belonged to Ferdinand Marcos is sufficient.

23

do not need the counter-finding that they did not belong

But the finding that they

a 1955 law that says anything that belongs to Marcos

terrible unfairness going on?

that a useful approach to this case is to say, well, if

that benefit everybody?

Well, then you have to look at
45

Alderson Reporting Company

the characteristic of the country, something I'm very

2

familiar with but which I don't want to -- I think it

3

would be inappropriate in this proceeding to talk about.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there -- is there

5

something special going on, specially unfair, in respect

6

to the delays where you are treated differently than

7

other litigants in the Philippines?

8

10

MR. SWIFT:

Yes.

There was purposeful delay

in us being able to transfer our judgment.

We are just

in the pleadings stage after 11 years there.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Counsel, what does

12

unfairness have to do with it?

13

doctrine of sovereign immunity rests upon unfairness.

14

It says you can't sue the sovereign even if you have a

15

valid claim.

16

doctrine as to foreign sovereigns, it means the same

17

thing.

18

it has unfair consequences.

19

immunity always has unfair consequences.

20

you're asking us to abandon the doctrine, the fairness

21

argument does not persuade me.

22

I mean the whole

And when we say we will apply the same

I'm just not terribly persuaded by the fact that

So, unless

Well, I think the issue was

23

resolved pursuant to 19(b).

Unless this Court

24

determines that there is a per se rule under 19(b), we

25

weigh factors, and it's the role of this Court to
46
Alderson Reporting Company

determine whether or not there was -- the lower courts

2

did not make a decision based on equity and good

3

conscience, one of the broadest parameters of

4

decisionmaking provided by a lower court.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I go back on exactly

6

that point on the equity to Justice Breyer's last

7

question?

8

question in something you said a moment ago, and then

9

you didn't repeat it, and I may have misunderstood you.

I thought you had given or anticipated his

10

I thought you had told us that the courts of the

11

Philippines did not recognize, for enforcement purposes

12

there, the judgment that your clients had obtained in

13

the United States, and that in effect they, therefore,

14

if they were going to make a claim on assets in the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Let me ask you this:

Did

6

the Philippine Government formally take a position in

7

raising these obstructive barriers, the $8 million

8

filing fee, for example?

9

MR. SWIFT:

10
11

It did not.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

That was sua sponte

with the court?

12

MR. SWIFT:

It was sua sponte with the -

13

actually raised with the Marcoses initially, and the

14

court simply said yes, it's $8.4 million.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't that -- I mean it

16

sounds shocking, but I thought that in the Philippines,

17

as in many countries, the filing fee is determined by

18

what you're asking for.

19

$2 billion.

20

then you say, oh, but, but this -- the filing fee of

21

that size would mean that the Plaintiffs can't sue.

22

that's -- but it wasn't they picked whatever figure,

23

filing fee, out of a hat; it was a percentage of what

24

was sought in the litigation right?

25

So it would be a percentage of

claims were resolved against them inter se, and so they

24

no longer have a dog in the fight.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

they are able to successfully knock out the judgment,

then they are back to square one.

out.

MR. SWIFT:

Then they -- they

Well, perhaps under Rule 19(b)

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If there was no authority

of the court to proceed, then the judgment is -- is as

though it were never made.

12

MR. SWIFT:

Well, that's perhaps one way of

13

looking at it, Justice Ginsburg.

I submit to you that

14

the -- the decision I would respectfully request you

15

look at is Horizon Bank and Trust Company versus

16

4

So, in addition, although there isn't a lot

5

of case law in this Court on this particular point, I

would refer you to the Ashcroft v. Mattis decision

22

I submit to you that there is a policy

judgment that has to be made by this Court as to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, Your Honor.

2

A couple of points.

First of all, there is

3

no doubt that the Republic has a substantial interest in

4

the assets that are at stake here.

5

sovereign immunity, at least in the context of this

6

case, should be dispositive and should have led to

7

dismissal under Rule 19.

8
9

And, therefore, its

There -- this Court in the Provident case
noted that there are certain compelling, substantive

10

considerations that are dispositive under Rule 19 that

11

make it unnecessary to consider any other balancing

12

consideration.

Sovereign immunity is one such

13

consideration.

And because the Republic has immunity,

14

has asserted immunity -

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You agree that the Ninth

16

Circuit gave sovereign immunity great weight in the

17

balancing?

18

MR. ROTHFELD:

I think it gave it no weight

19

at all.

I think it said that, yes, in theory, sovereign

20

immunity is entitled to weight.

21

going to ignore it completely because we believe that if

22

the Republic appears in New York and asserts its

23

interests, it will lose under statute of limitation

24

grounds.

25

treating it.

But in this case we are

That is a completely inappropriate way of

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Once the sovereign immunity was asserted and

2

there was a substantial interest in the asset here, as

3

there undoubtedly was, that should have been the end of

4

the matter.

5

The second point is there is no question

6

that, ultimately, this is a dispute between the Marcos

7

estate and the Republic.

8

claims of the Respondents here are entirely derivative

9

of the Marcos estate; and, therefore, that is something

There is no question that the

That's stated on the U.N.

Lynch could be subjected to duplicative liability

24

because this Court's judgment would determine that the

25

Republic is an indispensable party.
