CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Dellinger.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. DELLINGER:

Good morning, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

When the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince

12

William Sound on March 24, 1989, the resulting spill of

13

11 million gallons of oil was one of the worst

14

environmental tragedies in U.S. maritime history.

15

The only remaining aspect -- the only aspect

16

of the litigation over the Valdez disaster that is

17

before the Court today concerns almost entirely lost

18

revenues by the commercial fishing industry.

19

ago paid $400 million in compensation for that lost

20

revenue.

21

to the commercial fishing class of $2.5 billion dollars

22

in punitive damages is permissible under Federal

23

Maritime Law.

Exxon long

At issue here is whether an additional warrant

24

The first of the three reasons that the

25

decision below should be reversed is that the Ninth
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Circuit erred in overturning a maritime law rule that

2

has been settled for 200 years.

3

is, of course, liable to fully compensate for all of the

4

damages caused by the wrongful acts of a captain in

5

compensation, it is liable for punitive damages under

6

the long-settled rule only if the shipowner directed,

7

ratified, or participated in the -

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
that rule settled?

Although a shipowner

Mr. Dellinger, how was

You go in that story and The Amiable

10

Nancy, but no one even raised the question of punitive

11

or exemplary damages in those cases.

12

long-settled line of decisions of this Court in maritime

13

law that you are relying on?

14

MR. DELLINGER:

So what is the

Justice Ginsburg, The

15

Amiable Nancy is the only maritime case, but this Court

16

in Lake Shore in 1893 -

17
18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That was on land on the

railroad.

19

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes, but this Court's

20

unanimous opinion by Justice Gray in Lake Shore cites

21

with approval The Amiable Nancy decision and the

22

maritime context.

23

the question of whether there should be respondeat

24

superior liability in punitive damages for the wrongful

25

action.

Three times this Court has considered

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You are talking about

2

maritime law, and relying on The Amiable Nancy.

3

only point is that was not raised, argued, or decided.

4

So it's rather, I think, an exaggeration to call it a

5

long line of settled decisions in maritime law.

6

MR. DELLINGER:

And my

Justice Ginsburg, the issue

7

has been so well settled, and Courts of Appeals have so

8

long recognized, that punitive damages are not available

9

in vicarious liability in maritime cases that the issue,

10

understandably, doesn't -- doesn't come up.

11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's -

And we thought so in

Prentice.

13

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes.

In Lake Shore versus

14

Prentice, this Court did in 1818 and 1893 and 1999

15

address this question, once in the maritime context,

16

once in the context of Federal common law, and once in

17

the particular statutory context of -

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, the Lake Shore

19

case, if I remember right, did not involve a managerial

20

employee.

21

It involved a conductor on a train.
MR. DELLINGER:

That's -- that's correct.

22

But it -- but the rule is clear from Lake Shore versus

23

Prentice that it is the same rule as The Amiable Nancy

24

rule.

25

absence of some action on the part of the shipowner.

There is not respondeat superior liability in the

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

Now, the reason -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the shipowner is,

3

I suppose, the owner of Exxon or the hundreds of

4

thousands of shareholders, right?

5

shareholder driving the boat before you can assess

6

liability?

7

MR. DELLINGER:

No.

So you have to have a

The company acts

8

through its policymaking officers or through its

9

policies; so that if a reckless judgment is made by

10

someone who had authority to set policy for the company,

11

either the president of Exxon Shipping -- I mean if the

12

Plaintiffs were correct that the jury actually,

13

necessarily -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's not quite

15

correct to say only the owner.

16

17

through individuals.

18

in the company.

19

In other words, it is a

It is a certain level of employee

Now, where do you draw the line between the

20

CEO and the cabin boy?

21

suspect, just instinctively, that somebody driving one

22

of these huge tankers is a lot closer to the CEO than

23

the cabin boy.

24
25

How do you do that?

MR. DELLINGER:

And I would

The one thing that,

traditionally, if you look at all the Courts of Appeals
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cases and all of the tradition and maritime law, is that

2

the captain or the pilot, anyone on board the ship, does

3

not implicate in punitive damages the company, or the

4

shipowner.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

MR. DELLINGER:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You mean the captain -- or the ship owner.
-- is not a managerial

8

officer for any purpose?

9

going to leave despite an adverse weather report?

10
11

Suppose he decides that he's
Is he

not a managerial agent at least for that?
MR. DELLINGER:

I think the tradition is

12

clear, Justice Kennedy, that if it's a -- that the

13

maritime tradition is that, while you are liable for all

14

of the harms caused by that, the decisions made on the

15

ship do not implicate in punitive damages.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm -- I'm asking

17

about the concept of the managerial officer in general.

18

And I think that we can explore in this argument,

19

whether or not The Amiable Nancy held very squarely

20

about punitive damages, whether we ought to do so in the

21

first instance.

22

MR. DELLINGER:

That is correct.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it seems to me a large

24

part of that inquiry turns on what a managerial officer

25

is and what -- was Hazelwood not a managerial officer
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for any purpose at all?

2

MR. DELLINGER:

You know, I can't rule out

3

the possibility that someone in that position might be,

4

but he did not set company policy.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I thought that you're

6

talking about a different level.

7

clear on this.

8

was, indeed, a "managerial agent" as that term is used

9

in the Restatement of Torts, right?

10

I think we ought to be

I thought it was conceded that Hazelwood

So you are talking about it's not good

11

enough that you are managerial agent; you have to be in

12

a higher echelon in the company.

13

MR. DELLINGER:

That's your position?

That is correct.

There has

14

-- one has to be someone with authority to set relevant

15

policy who has some responsibility over that area of the

16

company's operations that would not -

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why should that be?

I

18

mean, why should there be a different rule?

19

assume -- I mean I'll assume for the sake of argument

20

that The Amiable Nancy does not settle the issue

21

absolutely.

22

Let's

Why, then, should the -- and it doesn't, it

23

seems to me, settle this distinction at all.

24

should there be a distinction between corporations

25

generally and maritime corporations?
8
Alderson Reporting Company

So why

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

MR. DELLINGER:

Well, there are two

responses to that question.

3

The first is that there is -- this has

4

worked in the context of maritime law for 200 years, and

5

-- and because of the -- there has been a long tradition

6

of needing to foster and promote maritime commerce, and

7

the fact that it's thought to be particularly risky and

8

dangerous to conduct maritime commerce.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But -

Well, isn't -- isn't part

10

of the reason, at least for the assumption that there's

11

a distinction, something that I think was mentioned in

12

The Amiable Nancy?

13

ship put to sea, the ship was sort of a floating world

14

by itself.

15

was simply gone until the thing came back into port

16

again.

17
18

And that is in those days, when a

And the -- the contact with the shipowner

That is certainly not the case today, and we
know it's not the case in the circumstances here.

19

So if the -- if the relationship to the

20

corporation, to the CEO, if you will, and the captain of

21

a vessel is not in any way different from the

22

relationship of the CEO and, say, a division chief of a

23

corporation, I don't see why that distinction should

24

hold today.

25

MR. DELLINGER:

There is no question,
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Souter, but that communications have -- have

2

improved.

3

of maritime law that still obtains.

4

because it takes place on the high seas, is an

5

inherently and continuously more risky endeavor than

6

most other occupations, but -

7

There is a -- there is much of the tradition

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Maritime commerce,

That may be an argument for

8

no punitive damages, but I don't see why it's an

9

argument for distinguishing between maritime

10

corporations and others.

11

of enterprises have a lot of risk in them, too.

12

missing the distinction there.

13

I mean, other -- other kinds

MR. DELLINGER:

And I'm

Well, to the extent that one

14

doesn't see that the tradition of -- of what's worked in

15

maritime law in its own system of law for 200 years

16

should be different, it is not at all clear why the

17

maritime law rule ought not be the rule on land.

18

are eight States -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There

Well, I had not understood

20

you to concede that -- that the land rule was different

21

from the maritime rule.

22

it's the same as what you assert the maritime rule to

23

be.

24
25

I gather that in many States

MR. DELLINGER:

That is correct.

And it is

the rule that this Court adopted in Lake Shore versus
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Prentice, and it is -- it is -

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which was a land case.

3

MR. DELLINGER:

And the policy behind it -

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you are right, and I

5

want to make -- let me just make clear one other point.

6

You are drawing a distinction, as I understood you to

7

say to Justice Ginsburg, between the Restatement

8

position and your position.

9

MR. DELLINGER:

That is correct -

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

11

MR. DELLINGER:

Okay.
-- although there are some

12

States that have the Restatement position that may read

13

"managerial employee" in the way that maritime law does,

14

and that is a person who is in a position to set

15

relevant policy for the company and not just the branch

16

manager at a -- at a Wal-Mart.

17
18
19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there aren't many

States that follow the Restatement position.
MR. DELLINGER:

That is correct.

And -- but

20

my point is not that -- my point is simply that there

21

are good reasons for the maritime law rule, and they

22

have been accepted in other cases.

23

When Justice Gray embraced that rule in the

24

Lake Shore case, he did so because he thought it

25

inappropriate to impose punitive elements on someone who
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was not actually the wrongdoer.

2

O'Connor wrote in Kolstad, she spoke of the important

3

principle underlying common law limitations on vicarious

4

liability for punitive damages.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And when Justice

Am I right, Mr.

6

Dellinger, that in the railroad case the court was

7

dealing with the concept of respondeat superior?

8

didn't make any distinction between regular employees

9

and managerial employees, and, indeed, it was not

10

It

dealing with a managerial employee.

11

MR. DELLINGER:

It was dealing with someone

12

who was at the level of a conductor, I think, exactly on

13

par with the captain.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I don't recall that

15

they made anything about managerial.

16

talking about respondeat superior at large, I thought.

17

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes.

Now, I think -

But I don't think the

23

They were just

But you are saying he binds Exxon for no

2

MR. DELLINGER:

For punitive damages.

3

course, they are bound to pay for all of the harm

4

caused.

5

But that JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Of course, we are talking

6

about punitive damages but at the concept of a

7

"managerial officer."

8

a managerial officer at least as to some things.

9

And I haven't heard why he isn't

MR. DELLINGER:

10

Of

Well, for two reasons:

One, he was unable to set policy for any of

11

these issues.

12

reason we want to hold someone, an entity or a person,

13

liable in punitive damages is because they make a

14

decision that is malicious or profit-seeking, or

15

whatever.

16

And think of the larger context.

The

When you are advancing the policies of the

17

company and are empowered to advance those policies, and

18

you do so in a way that is either malicious or driven by

19

profit motives or hope to conceal it, when all of those

20

things happen, it is appropriate to visit upon those

21

persons the extra punishment of punitive damages.

22

And that's why it's not the importance of

23

the job.

It's the fact that when someone acts contrary

24

to the interest -- contrary to the interest of a company

25

and its shareholders, why in that instance should
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

someone who is not advancing the company's interests,

2

not authorized to make policy, do so?

3

So if the -

MR. DELLINGER:

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

10

May I ask this question,

Mr. Dellinger?

9

Are you -

Yes.
In some punitive-damages

cases, the liability attaches because the person has
hired someone who is obviously incompetent.

11

Supposing that the -- a crew member was -

an obviously incompetent crew member was hired by the

13

captain of the ship.

Would that be sufficient to

MR. DELLINGER:

17

Not against the company that

Only if someone -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And if he was hired by a

18

shore-based personnel, then, would that be the

19

difference for you?

20

MR. DELLINGER:

The -- only if the company

21

at a policymaking level is implicated would the company

22

--

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The one -- the company

24

says the captain hires the crew members who could cause

25

all sorts of damage.

And another company says somebody
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

on shore can do it.

2

those two?

3

You have a different rule between

MR. DELLINGER:

Oh, well, I think if the

4

case arises in a maritime context, there would not be -

5

there would not be a different rule, whether a decision

6

was made on shore or not.

7

maritime law case -

8
9
10

If you are talking about a

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would there be vicarious

liability or not in the case:

Negligence in hiring an

incompetent crew member?

11

MR. DELLINGER:

Not unless the decision was

12

made by someone at a policymaking level.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

to decide who to hire.

15

Well, he has the authority

Is that policymaking?

MR. DELLINGER:

No.

That's the

16

implementation of -- that's the implementation of a

17

policy.

18

purposes of punitive damages, as to whether conduct

19

should be deterred and whether it should be punished,

20

and when you are talking about going against the

21

shareholders of the company, not -- of course, they have

22

to pay for all the compensatory harms.

23

that.

So I think what -- if you keep in mind the

We don't doubt

24

But for punishment the notion is that it is

25

the -- that-- that at least eight States have and it is
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in the maritime law rule that you need to show that

2

there is -- that there is -

3
4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Recklessness in hiring the

employee who caused the damage can be a -

5

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes, absolutely.

We have

6

not disputed the fact that if the jury actually did have

7

to conclude that Exxon was reckless in the supervision

8

or the hiring or the placement of Hazelwood, that that

9

would be a grounds for imputing punitive-damages

10
11

liability.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

In hiring the third mate

12

here, if he was negligently hired by somebody on shore,

13

there would be liability?

14

hired by the captain, there would be no liability?

15

But if he was negligently

MR. DELLINGER:

No.

I think it has to do

16

with the level at which the -- at which the hiring

17

decision was made.

18

think the way the case was tried it makes sense that if

19

senior officials for Exxon were informed and if the jury

20

decided on the basis that at a high level at Exxon

21

Shipping that they knew that this person was -- should

22

not be put in command of a ship, and, nonetheless, it

23

did so, that would implicate them.

24
25

It has to be a decision -- and I

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
sufficient evidence of that.

If I could -

There was -- there was
I mean -

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The jury could have found

3

that Exxon knew that this captain had a severe alcohol

4

problem; and, yet, they let him stay on voyage after

5

voyage and did nothing about it.

6

So the jury could have found:

Never mind

7

the captain.

8

because it allowed the tanker to be operated by a

9

captain who was certainly not fit.

10

Exxon, itself, is a grave wrongdoer

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes, and I want to be clear

11

about that.

12

jury could have found that Exxon was reckless in

13

allowing Hazelwood to command the ship and that that

14

recklessness would implicate the company for punitive

15

damages.

16

The answer to that question is:

But they need not have done so.

Yes, the

They need

17

not even have reached the issue, and the court of

18

appeals said -- it is at page 88 and 89.

19

Circuit said that the jury could also, in the

20

alternative, have found that Exxon followed a reasonable

21

policy of fostering reporting and treatment by alcohol

22

abusers, knew that Hazelwood had obtained treatment, and

23

did not know that he was taking command of the

24

ship drunk.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Ninth

There was evidence both ways.

2

right in thinking that if you succeed, all you can get

is a new trial?

4

MR. DELLINGER:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, on this issue, am I

That is correct.
And, I take it, next time

correct.

rule, right?

9

Now that seems to be the Federal

MR. DELLINGER:

10

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, what

11

happens to that Federal rule?

12

happened to it is that time passed; Erie v. Thompkins

13

came along; and most of the relevant cases left the

14

Federal courts or Federal law and were decided under

15

State law.

16

One thing we know

Was there anything left in the Federal

17

system besides admiralty where this Federal rule might

18

apply; and, if so, what happened to it?

19

MR. DELLINGER:

The only place it would

20

remain is in statutory settings where the court has to

law, and that we have a harder road to show that the

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

MR. DELLINGER:

All right.

The -- the Clean Water Act,

4

the reason it's an important issue, is that the one

5

thing that Congress has not done, whether it's in TAPAA,

6

in the Clean Water Act or the Oil Pollution Act, is they

7

have not provided for punitive damages but moreover,

8

they have never had any remedy that is uncalibrated,

9

that is limitless, that is not carefully measured so

10

that it respects the need to protect the interests to be

protective by those laws, by the interest in clean

12

water, with a decision not to overdeter.

13

The problem with having a punitive damages

14

remedy in an area where punitive damages has played no

what the criminal penalty is that's actually imposed.

the civil fine, the maximum civil fine here for both the

And

If you look to what the responsible law

enforcement authorities and public officials of both the

United States and Alaska thought was the proper amount,

And if you

What -- what you really have here is you 32
Alderson Reporting Company

the first thing you would start with, Justice Kennedy,

is to ask whether it is necessary for punishment and

deterrence.

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. DELLINGER:

essential to formulate some kind of rule.

guide is to look, I think, at civil penalties, which

gets to -- to $80 million, but to look to what the Court

said in your opinion in State Farm, where -- where

compensatories are so substantial it may eliminate any

There's -

May I go back to your

civil-penalty point?

10

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't the problem with the

12

civil-penalty argument is -- that the civil penalties

13

were calibrated for environmental damage, and what we

14

are dealing with here is individual economic damage?

we've got an apples and oranges comparison, haven't we?

MR. DELLINGER:

Right.

It -- even if you

2

took that as calibrated to the environmental damage, the

the total compensation paid was $500 million.

The

7

If $150 million was the right amount for the

8

environmental damage, then the right amount for the half

9

of that that constitutes the lost wages would be $75

10
11

million, which is itself close to the $80 million.
But here I think that it is incumbent upon

12

the Plaintiffs to show why you need deterrence when

13

there was no profit motive, and you've had to pay $3.4

14

million dollars.

15

that can't be a black hole into which all the limits on

16

punitive damages disappear.

17

And when if you look to punishment,

It's whether that -- if this Court can't set

18

standards that would limit an award of this kind, that

19

is a reason for believing that this ought to be done by

20

21

I'd like to reserve -

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

obvious kind of thing would to be say that the standard

would depend upon the reprehensibility of the conduct of

who supervises other employees and has responsibility

for, and authority over, particular aspects of a

corporation's business.

Alderson Reporting Company

And, as Justice Ginsburg noted, Exxon has

2

never disputed that Captain Hazelwood satisfied this

3

definition.

4

Captain Hazelwood was in charge of what they called a

5

business unit of Exxon Shipping.

6

hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment, of

7

product; he was in charge of budgeting and personnel

8

with respect to the vessel; he was also in charge of

9

safety.

As its own internal documents explain,

He was in charge of

He was the person who decided on behalf of

10

Exxon that it was safe to leave port the night of March

11

23, 1989.

12

Now, it is our submission that it is

13

perfectly appropriate to expose the corporation to

14

punitive damages based on the reckless acts of such an

15

individual.

16

In doing so, it does not, as Exxon would

17

contend, impose vicarious liability.

18

does is it exposes a corporation to liability based on

19

its own culpability.

20

Rather, what it

The very point of the restatement test, as

21

opposed to the vicarious liability rule that is followed

22

by the majority of the States, is that it requires some

23

complicity on the part of the corporation.

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice.

8

What is happening here -- and I want to
focus on this for a moment because Mr. Dellinger -

9
10

And the reason why is because the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you regard the

ship as a business unit?

11

MR. FISHER:

That's what Exxon regarded the

12

ship as, and so that's what the record says.

13

idea is that you had -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the

That's different if

15

they say that it's -- depending on how they categorize

16

the different units tells whether they are liable or

17

not?

18

MR. FISHER:

Well, I don't want to rest

19

primarily on labels.

20

think, going back to the instruction, what the

21

instruction is asking the jury to determine is:

22

a person who has authority over an aspect of a

23

corporation's business?

24

in Exxon's own documents that it is -

25

The idea is function.

And I

Is this

I think a shorthand for that is

The

So there has

Now, this notion of the idea that the master

18

isn't good enough because he had to be a policymaker is

19

new to us.

That was a question

that I asked, not a statement.

22

Well, how do you draw the line?

23

the second in command on the boat a man responsible for

policy?

MR. FISHER:

He may not be.

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, is

I don't think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the question is whether he's responsible for policy.

2

Again, it's whether he's the person in charge.

3

What Exxon during instruction to the

4

district court asked the jury to be required to find is

5

that there was a shore-based supervisory official of the

6

Exxon defendants who made the decision.

7

recognized that you have to draw the line somewhere.

8
9
10
11

So Exxon itself

We think the best place to draw the line,
and the conservative place to law, the line is the
managerial-agent rule that's in the Restatement.
Now, Mr. Dellinger says there are eight

12

States that follow a different rule.

And it's important

13

to understand that that's not the case.

14

States that follow the Lake Shore formulation in

15

general, you still have to have a way to implement it.

16

It's not -- the idea is if the corporation has to be

17

complicit, you still have to tell the jury which human

18

beings they can look to for that complicity.

19

So at page 33 of our red brief -

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even among the

I thought the Lake Shore -

21

well, I thought the Lake Shore and Amiable whatever it

But on page 33 of our red brief we've given

complicity test, and here's how you do it.

You require

Exxon itself in its reply brief on page page 11, footnote 5, cites several States.

And I gather

10

these are the States to which Mr. Dellinger is referring

11

when he says there are eight States that follow our

12

rule.

13

Well, we did some research after getting the

14

reply brief, and I want to give you a few cites, because

15

it illustrates the principle yet again.

those States say we follow the Lake Shore complicity

24

D.C. Circuit, Justice Scalia, they quote one of your

25

opinions.

In

If you look at D.C. law, the D.C. Court of

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do any of those cases say

5

the managerial agent is liable if he violated express

6

instructions from an employer?

7

MR. FISHER:

No State tort case that we're

8

aware of, Justice Kennedy, adopts -- I think what you're

9

referring to is the Kolstad policy exception.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because that's what the

last part of your instruction 33 says.

to me that this captain may be managerial for some

purposes and not others.

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that's because he was not entitled to set aside the

2

policy on intoxication.

3

MR. FISHER:

Well, if you were to adopt a

4

rule that no other State has adopted, which is to say

5

there was a policy defense in ordinary tort cases, which

6

unlike Kolstad do not rest on the subjective knowledge

7

of the actor, even then, we submit, we tried that issue

8

in this case, Justice Kennedy; and there was -- Exxon

9

had every opportunity to argue policy.

In its closing

10

argument to the jury, the only policy it mentioned was

11

the policy of two officers on the bridge while

12

transporting -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No.

Your instruction says

14

if he was a managerial agent, his acts are attributable

15

to the corporation.

16

That's it.

MR. FISHER:

That's right, Justice Kennedy.

17

We think that's the proper rule of law.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the corporation's

19

responsibility or complicity or culpability is simply

20

not relevant under your theory of the case, even though

21

that's what you talk about in your brief.

22

MR. FISHER:

Well, I don't want to act like

23

a dog chasing his tail here, Justice Kennedy, but the

24

idea is to ask whether the corporation is culpable, you

25

have to ask which people.

And what happened in this
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court's own decision in Kolstad said in implementing

2

Lake Shore that you look to the managerial agents.

3

that's what -

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

That's -- that's why I'm

5

interested in the same question I asked on the other

6

side.

7

reading of it that it picked up this distinction that

8

Justice Story made, and it said quite right, you could

9

impute punitives or exemplary damages to a corporation

As I read Lake Shore, it seemed to me my first

10

where its managerial official is the one who causes -

11

who behaves recklessly.

12

that.

But wait, we don't mean quite

We mean some managerial officials.

13

And they seem to refer in the admiralty

14

case, I'll tell you one who he isn't, namely, the ship's

15

captain.

16

other case, they say -- they talk about a superintending

17

agent authorized to imply, employ, and discharge the

18

conductor.

19

He's not in that category.

And then in this

And they give that as an example of a

20

managerial official where there would not be exemplary

21

damages assessed against the corporation in light of his

22

conduct.

23

So when I read that, I thought that this

24

Lake Shore case is just picking up the earlier case; and

25

that's the Federal law.

And you've given the examples
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

where the State law has changed; and I have no doubt you

2

are right.

3

You read the cases very well.
But is there an example where I could say

4

that the Federal law has changed, too?

5

down that track, but the reason this is of probably more

6

than inordinate concern to me is that I wrote the case

7

in Sand, I wrote a dissent in Legion, I looked into

8

stare decisis law and made fairly clear views of what it

9

is.

10

And you started

So what would you say to someone who has

11

accepted certain legal principles that we have had in

12

prior cases?

13

Okay.

14

And you want to say nonetheless you win.

Why?
MR. FISHER:

Three reasons, Justice Breyer.

15

The first is with all due respect, Amiable Nancy did not

16

involve the wrongdoing of the captain.

17

wrongdoing of a lower officer on the ship; and so

18

it's -- there's nothing in the Amiable Nancy that deals

19

with captains, so you don't have a stare decisis effect

20

that comes from Amiable Nancy with respect to captains.

21

It involved the

The second thing is there are some more

22

recent Federal cases that discuss the Lake Shore

23

managerial agent idea.

24

our red brief along through -- I'm flipping now -- but

25

there are RICO cases; there are other cases, and

We've cited them in our -- in

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Mr. Dellinger said, where statutory case -- statutory

2

regimes need to be implemented.

3

several lower court decisions that look to the

4

managerial agent rule to do that, none of this Court.

5

And we have cited

The third thing is to understand, as you

6

talked about in Lake Shore, you are having to pick

7

somebody, and the general idea is higher up is okay, and

8

way down low is not okay.

9

corporations says that if the Lake Shore idea is to make

Fletcher in his Cyclopedia on

10

sense today, you have to understand that when you're

11

dealing with humongous corporations, you have to look

12

not just to the president or vice president -- and this

13

is what the D.C. Circuit said in the GMAC case as well

14

-- is that when you deal with multinational corporations

15

with tens of thousands of employees and divisions, you

16

look to -- you look a little bit lower down than those

17

top job titles to managers.

18

And so again this is what Professor

19

Schoenbaum says in his amicus brief to this Court

20

dealing with that from a maritime perspective.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Fisher, you -

22

your friend says in his reply brief that you cannot cite

23

one U.S. maritime case that has allowed vicarious

24

liability for punitive damages.

25

MR. FISHER:

Is this the first one?

No, it would not be, Mr. Chief
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice.

2
3

What we did CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What's your best

case?

4

MR. FISHER:

What we did our reply brief -

5

I'm sorry, what we did in our red brief is cite to

6

Professor Robertson's article in saying that he

7

collected the cases, and which he did; and so our best

8

cases are the City of Carlisle case, the Ludlow and

9

Ralston against States Rights is very close.

10

There's a

distinction in Ralston versus exemplary -

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, let's take -

12

take the Ludlow.

13

the court found that the owner is not vicariously

14

liable.

15

Mr. Dellinger says that's a case where

MR. FISHER:

We don't think that's the right

16

reading of the case.

17

our own brief that says that there are only two cases

18

that they cite in which a captain's conduct is not

19

imputed to the ship's owner.

20

100 years old, and neither of them deal with

21

corporations.

22

We submit -- we have a footnote in

They are both more than

So I think it is entirely fair to say that

23

you have more or less an open issue before you today.

24

What I think I want to be sure the Court understands,

25

though, is that there is not a stare decisis problem
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that this Court has to confront with respect to the

2

first question.

3

cases that lean in different directions.

4
5

You have a spattering of a few old

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so it differs from

Sand, for example, where they are like two cases?

6

MR. FISHER:

Pardon me?

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

It differs from Sand?

You

8

say it is not -- I'm interested in your last remark.

9

the Sand ways I found -- you know we went through it,

10

public policy was on the other side.

11

several cases, it wasn't a thousand; it was more like

12

two; and the Supreme Court had said in two cases, one

13

very clearly, you know -- you see the point there.

14

MR. FISHER:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16
17

In

But -- but we had

Yes.
Why do you say there is no

stare decisis problem?
MR. FISHER:

Well, because neither Amiable

18

Nancy nor the Lake Shore case, which are the only two

19

cases from this Court, dealt with a managerial agent.

20

The more recent cases from this Court, Hydrolevel and

21

Kolstad -- Hydrolevel says any agent for treble damages

22

for antitrust, and Kolstad follows the managerial agent

23

principle, following in the natural evolution of Amiable

24

Nancy and Lake Shore.

25

So I don't think this Court has ever
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

considered it to be any stare decisis problem, even if

2

all of the lower courts were lined up against it, which

3

is far from the -- far from the case here.

4

have is a just few lower courts in either correction.

5

gather that's one of the reasons why this Court decided

6

to grant certiorari in this case, because there's some

7

dispute among the lower courts as to exactly how this

8

principle works in maritime law.

9
10

But again, we don't think there's any
problem with this Court -

11

about the company policy; but as far as Exxon having a

policy, you don't mix alcohol with employment on a

21

enforced policy.

There's a second part of Kolstad that says

law rule, the proper Federal common law rule.

9

test.

We have

It is an objective

And so there's no worry in imposing punitive

10

damages here, that you're going to -- that you're going

11

to dissuade an employer from training its employees.

Now, on the facts, even if you were to agree

the facts, Justice Ginsburg.

MR. FISHER:

On the Or the last part of the

instruction 36, I think.
MR. FISHER:

On the first part of the case
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in phase one that was our -- that was the legal theory,

2

Justice -- you're right, Justice Kennedy.

3

three of the trial when a jury decided whether to award

4

punitive damages, the instructions told it, among other

5

things -- this is instruction 30 in phase three -- it

6

told among other things to consider whether or not the

7

wrongdoers were violating company policy.

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in phase

Well, but that -- that

goes to measures, not to liability.

10

MR. FISHER:

Absolutely.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That was the first phase.

12

And that's the instruction, it seems to me, that you

13

have to explain.

14

MR. FISHER:

Well, I -- I accept that, and I

15

think I've explained that by distinguishing an ordinary

16

tort case from the situation in Title VII.

17

instructive for this Court, and we agree with Exxon that

18

when this Court sits as a maritime court, it looks for

19

guidance to what other State courts have done.

20

think it's instructive that not one single State court,

21

either before or after Kolstad, has adopted a policy

defense for defendants.

on the books outside of discrimination cases.

Well -

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you're saying -

18

that's the question I'm asking.

What if there is a

19

breach of the corporate policy?

I don't see what more a

20

corporation can do.

21

other than what?

22

is this, and if somebody breaks the policy, they're

23

liable for compensatory damages, which can as this case

24

shows be in the billions of dollars, and of course the

25

individual is liable for punitive and other awards.

I mean, your --- other than -

I mean it has to say that the policy

them.

I suppose that would

MR. FISHER:

Well, if we're to the point

18

where the question is whether or not the policy was

19

enforced, we'll very happily rest on the record in this

case, because that was what we tried to the jury:

there was no serious alcohol policy that was enforced.

would like you to address at some point at your

convenience what should the standards be if, in fact,

3

the captain of a ship, or responsible for conditions,

4

for example, negligence or recklessness is now going to

5

be not only imputed to the corporation but subject for

6

punitives.

7

Now, what I'm interested in, in the back of

8

my mind is:

This is a very dramatic accident.

It

involves oil spills, and they cause a enormous amount of

10

trouble.

places.

But there are accidents every day, and ships

And there are all kinds of things that go

And if, in fact, it has not been normal in

admiralty until now to assess punitives against the

16

corporation on the basis of the activity of, say, the

ship's master, failures of responsibility, then it will

be a new world for the shipping industry and for those

MR. FISHER:

As I

1

transfer there, I want to point out that I think the

2

only reason that we heard in the first -- the first

3

portion of the argument for absolving Exxon of

4

responsibility in the situation is because of the

5

dangerousness of captaining vessels like this.

6

This Court has already addressed that

7

concern in its collision doctrine, and tort law

8

generally addresses the problem of dangerous activities

9

and split-second decisions.

And the answer to that is

10

they are simply not reckless when somebody makes a

good-faith decision in a crisis in the midst of

dangerous activity.

the way you framed it, as Professor Robertson explained,

punitive damages are -- have always been firmly

established in maritime law.

isn't sitting as a maritime court.

2

as a common-law-type court.

3

start is with the common-law tradition, which is that

4

cases are tried to juries; juries make the first

Correct me if I'm wrong.

13

as a common-law-type court.

22

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

I'm not going to fight

23

you on that, Justice Kennedy.

There was an earlier

24

sentence in Cooper that says if no constitutional issue

25

is raised, the only thing an appellate court should do
59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is review for abuse of discretion.

2

ultimately you end up in the same place, which is that

3

there's a de novo review of the excessive -- of whether

4

the award is excessive based on the facts that have been

5

-- that have been tried.

6

But I think that

And if this Court is going to adopt a set of

7

guideposts for maritime law, we think the proper place

8

to look is the due- process cases this Court has already

9

decided.

10

This Court has already -- in its due-process

11

cases, the Court looked to the common law.

12

where, I gather, the guideposts this Court adopted came

13

from:

14

said was the most important indicia, as well as a

15

reasonable relationship, what's commonly referred to as

16

the "ratio test."

17

That's

Reprehensibility, in particular, which this Court

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What about -- what about

18

looking to the Clean Water Act?

And I wanted to ask you

19

this question about the Act.

20

that -- that it was too late to raise the Clean Water

21

Act as a separate pre-emptive factor in the case, why

22

was it too late in the appellate court to raise the

23

Clean Water Act as an additional reason why maritime law

24

should not be interpreted to allow punitive damages and,

25

in part 3 of the case, as a factor, why punitive damages

Assuming we agree with you

60
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the amount at issue here should not be allowed?

2

It seems to me there it's not a new

3

argument.

4

that have already been made.

5

It's just an additional factor for arguments

MR. FISHER:

I think I accept what you said,

6

Justice Scalia.

7

of the award, we never contested Exxon's ability to

8

argue that the Clean Water Act is one place you can

9

look.

10

The third -- with respect to the size

So, if you were to look to the Clean Water

11

Act, you initially have the problem that Justice Souter

12

mentioned.

13

The Clean Water Act sets a fine cording to the

14

environmental harm.

15

estimated in its -- and this is in its brief -- and that

16

came out to be -- I believe the number is about

17

$2.6 billion.

18

You have the apples and oranges problem.

Now, the State of Alaska had that

So, if you were to look -- if you were to

19

put aside the apples and oranges problem and look to the

20

Clean Water Act, then you get almost the number that

21

we're standing here with today.

22

If you look at the harm a different way, you

23

still get an extremely large number.

24

million of compensation to the Plaintiffs.

25

top of that, we think in light of the way this Court has
61
Alderson Reporting Company

You get $500
And then on

Official - Subject to Final Review

addressed ratio analysis in its other cases, you need to

2

take account of the fact that there are vast injuries

3

that have not resulted in any compensation.

4

So to do any kind of -

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

That's part 3.

What

6

about part 2?

Why -- why can't the Petitioner raise the

7

argument or why could not the Petitioner raise it in the

8

court of appeals?

9

Act does not pre-empt the granting of punitive damages

Okay, we agree that the Clean Water

10

here, but one of the factors that we ought to take into

11

account in deciding whether modern admiralty law in this

12

situation permits punitive damages is the existence of

13

the Clean Water Act.

14

Is that also waived, do you think?

15

MR. FISHER:

That's not a pre-emption thing.

Well, I think it would be

16

because that's --

they never made that argument in the

17

district court, and they didn't make that argument to

18

the -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They don't have to make

20

every tiny little argument.

21

additional points on appeal so long as it's under the

22

same major heading.

23

the Clean Water Act pre-empts punitive damages; the

24

major heading is, rather, modern admiralty law does not

25

permit.

I mean, you can think of

And the major heading here is not

And, you know, they had made other arguments
62
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

about prior cases; they had talked about State law; and

2

this is just another argument:

3

another one.

4

By the way, here's

There's the Clean Water Act.

MR. FISHER:

Well, they didn't make that

5

argument, but if they had, I don't think it ends up

6

being any different than their pre-emption argument

7

because -- remember their pre-emption argument isn't a

8

pure pre-emption argument.

9

saying the Plaintiffs can't recover compensatory

They're not here today

10

damages, as was the case in the Milwaukee and Illinois

11

case, for example.

12

Clean Water Act displaces our ability to recover

13

punitive damages.

14

What they're saying is that the

And there, by making the argument that I

15

gather you've sketched out, it looks very much like the

16

same argument that they didn't properly make.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. FISHER:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's close.

But it doesn't But it doesn't really say

20

pre-emption, and so it's -- it's just another factor to

21

consider when you decide what the evolving law of

22

admiralty requires.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There was a statute that

24

was raised in the district court.

And the district

25

court raised this TAPA Act, and they thought that that
63
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was the statutory guide, and that was the reason why

2

there should not be punitive damages, but -- so that was

3

one of the things the court of appeals said under the

4

head of waiver.

5

statute for another.

6

They're substituting one federal

MR. FISHER:

That's right, Justice Ginsburg.

7

And at page 103 of the joint appendix, the district

8

court ruled on that motion and held that TAPAA was the

9

statute that was controlling with respect to spills of

10

trans-Alaska oil and that the savings clause of TAPAA

11

expressly preserved our ability to seek punitive

12

damages.

13
14

That's a ruling that, as you noted, Exxon
never appealed, and so it is the law of the case.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

A while ago you were

16

about to make a point on the Limitation of Liability

17

Act.

18

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

A little while ago,

20

you were about to make a point on the Limitation of

21

Liability Act.

22

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I was -- I would

24

have thought that cuts heavily against you on the third

25

point.

In other words, if we're looking to guidance,
64
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you look to Federal law.

2

applicable or not, the Limitation of Liability Act

3

reflects a very strong Federal policy about restricting

4

liability on shipowners, adopted at a time when it was

5

intended to encourage maritime -- the maritime economy.

6

And why isn't that something we should look to, at least

7

under question three?

8
9

MR. FISHER:

And whether it's directly

Well, as I said, I agree you

should look to it, but you should do it in a way this

10

Court's Miles decision instructs.

11

doesn't just enact general policies.

12

statute that gives some protection, Congress indicates

13

not just a general policy, but more importantly, the

14

sphere into which that policy is to be given effect.

15

It says that Congress
By enacting a

And so the notion that Congress did step in

16

and give shipowners some protection but left out

17

shipowners like Exxon that behave in the manner at issue

18

in this case, we think is a strong -

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that means

20

they don't get the really quite extraordinary protection

21

that the limitation of liability gives.

22

that we should ignore the reflection of that policy

23

outside the confines of the Limitation of Liability Act.

24
25

MR. FISHER:

It doesn't mean

Well, I think -- I think you

should look to it and understand that Congress has
65
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

declined to give the protection.

2

passed right after the spill in direct response to the

3

spill, Congress made explicit that the Limitation Act

4

should never apply to spills of Trans-Alaska oil.

5

the TAPAA did the same thing in the -

6

In OPA 90, which was

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

The argument is not

7

that the Limitation of Liability Act should apply.

8

that it would be very strange to say, where Congress has

9

radically reduced the exposure of shipowners in one

10

area, that we as a matter of development of Federal

11

common law, Federal maritime law should allow

12

dramatically expanded punitive liability in another area

13

of shipowning liability.

14

MR. FISHER:

It's

Well, we don't think we're

15

asking for any kind of expansion of liability.

16

we're asking is for the traditional admiralty rule which

17

has been recognized by Justice Story early on and all

18

through the cases that in cases of reckless indifference

19

a shipowner can be held liable for punitive damages.

20

The only thing -

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All

Mr. Fisher, the problem I

22

have -- maybe it isn't a problem I have, but a question

23

that that argument raises is this:

24
25

We know something now that Justice Story did
not know, and that is we've had an awful lot more
66
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

experience with punitive damages practice.

2

spent the last decade or so of this Court dealing with

3

the problem of how to set constitutional limits for

4

awards which sort of by most people's standards verged

5

on the excessive.

6

And we've

The problem that we've had -- we've had two

7

problems in coming up with those constitutional

8

standards:

9

One is we can't simply substitute ourselves

10

as lawmakers for the State.

11

constitutional limits, not optimum standards.

12

We're talking about

And number two, given those limits on us, we

13

have not been able to come up with anything that could

14

be called determinant standards.

15

example, found a sufficient reason constitutionally to

16

put an absolute ratio kind of limit on it.

17

We've never, for

But here, as you were pointing out earlier,

18

we're sitting as a kind of common-law court.

19

the position of the States here.

20

We are in

Why shouldn't we recognize the difficulty of

21

trying to deal with indeterminate limits which we've

22

proven in the constitutional context and say, therefore,

23

we've simply got to come up with a number, because no

24

other way is going to give us any kind of an

25

administrable standard; and our number -- and I'm not
67
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

saying this should be it -- but our number is going to

2

be double the compensatory damages?

3
4

Would that be an illegitimate thing for us
to do or an unwise thing for us to do?

5

MR. FISHER:

6

stick with unwise, Justice Souter.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. FISHER:

9

That's the limit.

Well, I think it would -- I'll

And I think the reason why is

because we agree with that.

You should -- you should

10

look to the experience of the States.

11

State, as a matter of common law authority, has set a

12

bright-line ratio.

13

Not one single

The only place -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the -- the United

14

States Code, the general criminal code, 18 U.S.C. 3571,

15

has exactly that number.

16

pecuniary loss for a criminal act.

17

It's -- for -- it's double the

And it seems to me, if when we're looking

18

for guidance, as Justice Souter quite properly indicated

19

we must, and Justice Scalia has indicated with reference

20

to the Water Act, that this is -- gives us a very

21

valuable instruction.

22

MR. FISHER:

We think that's one place this

23

Court can look.

But again, a common-law court, we

24

believe, sets standards, not a bright-line rule.

25

were to adopt some sort of bright-line statute, you'd
68
Alderson Reporting Company

If you

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have to deal with any number of legislative problems

2

that the several States have dealt with and Congress,

3

when it has passed these kinds of limits.

4

First, you have to decide the ratio number.

5

You have to pull something out there.

6

decide is it on a per capita basis in terms of -- what

7

several States have done is they've set a limit, that a

8

ratio only kicks in at a certain dollar amount.

9

case, it's worth remembering that the plaintiffs are

10

only standing to recover $75,000 a piece in punitive

11

damages.

12

Then you have to

In this

Now, most States that even have caps, or

13

several of the States at least, say they don't apply if

14

the awards are under a $100,000 per capita.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

What's even the

16

theory of that?

Because the theory of punitives is that

17

the individual who's receiving the money wasn't hurt one

18

penny's worth?

19

MR. FISHER:

But the theory -

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that really the money

21

ought to go to the people generally in the State or it

22

ought to go to other people, rather than those people

23

who have already been compensated.

24

it.

25

MR. FISHER:

That's the theory of

I think that's 69

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

JUSTICE BREYER:

That exhibits the

difficulty for me of trying to figure out how to do it.

3

MR. FISHER:

I think the theory of the

4

States, Justice Breyer, is that if you hurt lots and

5

lots of people, it's a worse act than if you only hurt

6

one or two.

7

destroyed an entire regional economy, that it would be

8

inappropriate to give some sort of credit for that by a

9

lower ratio just because you've harmed more people.

And so if you have, as in this case,

10

Now, there's also -

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But isn't the measure what

12

is necessary to deter?

13

first and foremost, not exclusively perhaps?

14
15

MR. FISHER:

Isn't that what we've asked

Well, I think you've looked at

punishment and deterrence, Justice Kennedy.

16

And if I could finish the last thing I want

17

to say about looking at a ratio, several States that

18

even have ratios carve out drunk driving cases and cases

19

involving intoxication from any other otherwise

20

applicable limits.

21

why, Justice Kennedy, is deterrence.

22

let's start with deterrence, but I want to frame that

23

discussion by recognizing that in Cooper this Court said

24

that deterrence is not the only goal; you also look to

25

punishment.

And that's -- I think one reason

70
Alderson Reporting Company

And so, I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Now, I think Exxon's primary argument on

2

deterrence grounds is that we've paid $3.4 billion out

3

of our pocket already as a result of this spill, and

4

that's a lot of money.

5

their tax credit and insurance benefits for that money,

6

the number is really under 2 billion.

7

lot of money.

8
9

The reality is, once they get

But it's still a

And so I think it's important to look at the
district court proceedings involving the Clean Water

10

Act, involving the criminal prosecution here, and ask

11

whether it makes sense to have Exxon pay additional

12

money in punitive damages.

13

We think it is.

The first thing to understand is that the

14

same district judge that saw the criminal proceedings in

15

money for punishment in the criminal case is $25

into the environment.

7

All the rest of the money is, as the district

Now, for $25 million fine that Exxon paid in

8

the criminal case, the district judge explained -- or

9

I'm sorry, the district judge approved the statement

10

that the U.S. attorney submitted, which said the basis

11

for this is that the captain and the third mate were

12

negligent.

13

That was the only thing even there.
It wasn't until our trial and our discovery

14

that it was brought out that the complicity of the

organization ran far deeper.

three of our trial, which was entirely about Exxon's

conduct, not any more at all about Captain Hazelwood's

conduct -- in phase three of our trial we started out

the closing argument by saying here's the relevant

20

evidence for the jury.

21

And so at our -- phase

And we played something for the jury called

22

Trial Compilation 9.

Now, that appears at appears at

There are 50 segments in Trial Compilation

2

9, and all 50 deal with Exxon's upper management

3

receiving reports of Hazelwood's conduct and deeming it

4

a gross error to put him in command and so forth, all

5

there.

6

So it wasn't until the trial in our case

7

that it came out how deep the complicity ran in the

8

organization and how reprehensible the conduct was.

And in reviewing the award the district

judge said:

Now, with that level of complicity and

reprehensibility, I think the jury could have decided

this is what he deemed a critical factor supporting the

punitive award.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, doesn't that show,

74
Alderson Reporting Company

then, that there had to be a finding that they did the

bad thing?

3

MR. FISHER:

No.

If you accept our argument

in the first that to get in the door, all we had to show

5

was that a managerial agent was reckless and that

6

Captain Hazelwood, as Exxon conceded, Was a managerial

agent.

and I think we're talking about the third question

9

presented, the size of the award -- all the -- all the

certainly they are resolved in a way that conducting de

But I don't want to leave Justice Kennedy's

of deterrence, there are two legs in which Exxon has

clearly not been deterred.

The first is that Exxon's

organization, and this came out at trial, that the idea

MR. FISHER:

By definition,

Justice Ginsburg, this is a mandatory punitive class, so

this is the one and only time Exxon will face the

11

respect of punitive damages.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you don't have the

13

problem of litigant A getting these punitive damages and

14

than B, C and D all wanting to -

15

MR. FISHER:

Right.

One of the many ways in

16

which this case is the mirror image of the due process

17

18

this Court to have such great concern about the uptick

19

in punitive damages, here you have a single case.

You have -- in contrast to State Farm, in

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. DELLINGER:

Let me begin by noting that

17

it's -- I do not think the Court will find in the record

18

that Exxon said this was expected and approved the -

19

you can look at that excerpt on the DVD and see for

20

yourself what was -- what was meant by that.

21

With respect, it is difficult to decide what

22

level of employee should implicate a company; but it is

23

divisible I think, as Justice Kennedy suggested.

24

based on whether that employee has authority over the

25

policy, and even a ship captain may have authority over
78
Alderson Reporting Company

It is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

some policies; he did not here.

2

what the Ninth Circuit held was that Exxon was liable -

3

could be liable for 2.5 billion, simply because against

4

its policies, Hazelwood left the deck.

5

we need to be found.

6

At the end of the day

That's all that

Now with respect to the -- with respect to

7

the amount of punitive damages here, where you are -

8

punitive damages cases generally look to for the need to

9

deter the activity where someone acts out of malice and

10

hostility, intending to harm, which is not true here; or

11

when a corporation acts out of a profit motive and hopes

12

perhaps it will be concealed or that it will make enough

13

money off of it.

14

nothing by what went wrong in this case, and paid dearly

15

for it.

16

That is not true here.

Exxon gains

In the criminal case, the U.S. and Alaska

17

agreed that the amount of the penalty was quote,

18

"sufficient to provide punishment and deterrence for the

19

conduct in question."

20

Now if you talk about the -- the amount

21

where you have that kind of deterrent, for an

22

unintentional act that -- of the amount that's already

23

paid, I heard no response to what one would say to

24

Justice Kennedy's opinion in State Farm as an outer,

25

outer limit.

In State Farm the Court said where
79
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

compensatory damages are substantial, then perhaps -

2

this is the constitutional context -- perhaps an amount

3

equal to compensatories would be the most.

4

What was substantial there was 1 million

5

dollars.

The compensatories here were 400 or 500 times

6

the -- what the Ninth Circuit found -- 504 million

7

dollars.

Yes?

8
9
10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Just as a class, if you

take them individually, each individual, did Mr. Fisher
say 15,000 something?

11

MR. DELLINGER:

Well, from the stand -

12

first of all, from the stand point of a company it

13

doesn't matter whether you pay one person 500 million

14

dollars or a lot of people 500 million dollars, in terms

15

of punishment and deterrence.

16

But also it is the case that -- that with

17

regard to the first plaintiff who had been fully

18

compensated, the argument would have been that in light

19

of all that happened, there is no need for punishment

20

and deterrence even in the first case, and certainly

21

cumulatively, when the amount ad reached, say the amount

22

of the civil fines of 80 million, one would have said no

23

more punitives, because the purpose of punitive damages

24

is a public purpose.

25

individual.

It is not to compensate the

80
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Here we're at 500 times what was considered

2

substantial in State Farm.

I don't see -- and what is

3

that -- that part of State Farm is to be considered a

4

dead letter, how one could not see that this is the

5

case.

6

outer limit, because if you look to what the civil

7

penalties would be that responsible officials have

8

obtained, it is 80.2 million dollars; and when you look

9

to the fact that this is a case where, as Justice Breyer

But that -- that amount of compensatories is an

10

notes, with the First Circuit opinion, outside the

11

fishing context there would have been no compensatories

12

paid at all, or owing, because it's consequential

13

damages and in most States, the great majority of the

14

States, that is not even a compensable -- a compensable

15

injury.

16

But it is a special rule for -- for fishing.
So these are awards -- that would not have

17

been done in any case.

This was a tragic and terrible

18

event, and one for which the company has paid dearly,

19

and the -- at the end of the day, the question will be

20

whether this Court without any guidance should assume

21

that there should a punitive damages remedy in areas

22

where Congress has already acted, and whether, if so,

23

the plaintiffs have made out any case of an additional

24

need for punishment and deterrence beyond what public

25

authorities have agreed to.
