ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY K. POSNER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MS. POSNER:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice

and may it please the Court:
For two reasons, the Sixth Circuit was wrong

12

to hold that a company that is an ERISA claim fiduciary

13

and that separately funds the plan's liabilities must

14

always be deemed to be operating under a conflict of

15

interest that changes the employer's designated

16

arbitrary and capricious standard of review under its

17

plan document.

18

on common ground with and that is, as this Court

19

recognized in Pegram v. Herdrich, ERISA explicitly

20

authorizes companies like MetLife to fulfill both

21

fiduciary and nonfiduciary functions as long as it does

22

not in actuality commingle those functions.

23

fact that the potentiality of conflict is inherent in

24

all of these commonplace dual arrangements in ERISA

25

welfare benefit plans is not enough on its own to

And the first reason is one that we're

3
Alderson Reporting Company

The mere

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

displace the employer's designated abuse of discretion

2

standard of review.

3

And secondly --

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but neither, neither

5

does the fact that there may be dual capacities

6

eliminate the fact that there are contrary tugs on the,

7

the individual or the, or the organization that has the

8

dual responsibilities, and there's no reason that the

9

law should be blind to that.
MS. POSNER:

10

No, Your Honor, it should not

11

be blind.

And as Firestone recognized, though, if in

12

fact there is a, an entity that is in actuality

13

conflicted, a claim administrator, then that conflict

14

doesn't change the standard of review.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

What do you mean by --

16

let's get straight by what we mean by "in actuality

17

conflicted."

18

interest in actuality conflicted?

Isn't the fiduciary who has a financial

19

MS. POSNER:

We're using the words --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And aren't we talking in

21

this case always about fiduciaries who are in actuality

22

conflicted.

23

MS. POSNER:

No, Your Honor.

We are using

24

these terms to designate in actuality a conflicted

25

fiduciary is one that has been infected or the decision
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was infected by the conflict.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

That's, that's a

3

conflicted fiduciary who allows the conflict to warp its

4

judgment.

5

you give it effect or not.

6

But the conflict exists whether you, whether

MS. POSNER:

Yes, that's right, Your Honor.

7

There is a conflict that we're saying is a potential

8

conflict.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So let's call that a

10

conflicted fiduciary, somebody who has two loyalties,

11

whether or not he allows the one loyalty to distort his

12

judgment.

13

MS. POSNER:

Yes.

And as this Court

14

recognized in Firestone, Your Honor, when there is an

15

actual conflict, that's --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let me follow up on

17

Justice Scalia's question because I think your brief

18

really goes astray on that.

19

situations like the remainderman who is the trustee.

20

has to look out for the interests of the live tenant,

21

but he's going to keep all the rest, so maybe he wants

22

to be economical.

23

I've always understood that the term "conflicting

24

interests" means just that; you have conflicting

25

interests.

Think of the many

That's not saying that he is.

So

He

It doesn't mean that you necessarily slide
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

over into misconduct.

2

keep that separation in mind, is there a conflicting

3

interest?

4

slipped and taken unfair advantage because of the

5

conflicting interests?

6

And I think that if you would

Yes, there is.

MS. POSNER:

Has the trustee in fact

That's exactly the distinction

7

that we are making by using actual and potential or, as

8

this Court said, possible and actual in Firestone.

9

where that slip occurs in trust law or in ERISA and it

10
11

And

infects the decision, the Firestone court -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does it have to be just

12

the specific decisions?

13

not have clear rules of, what do you call them,

14

firewalls between the profit side and the claims

15

processing side.

16

greater, more searching standard of review, say de novo?

17

Suppose that the company does

Would that be enough to cause a

MS. POSNER:

I don't think it would ever

18

result in a de novo review.

I think what it is is a

19

factor that should be weighed with all the other factors

20

that go to the actual benefits decision.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So then you're saying, A,

22

the fact that there is a potential conflict is not

23

enough; B, the fact that there are no procedures in the

24

company to ensure that the conflict doesn't affect the

25

judgment, that is not enough either.
6

2

MS. POSNER:

No.

I'm not saying that.

I'm

saying that if --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm positing.

Does the

4

fiduciary at least have the, the burden of production to

5

show that it has established clear lines of demarcation,

6

firewalls, whatever you call them, within the company?

7

Does it have at least that obligation going forward?

8
9

MS. POSNER:

No, Your Honor, it does not,

and as the United States -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

Well then, I don't know

11

what effect you're giving to the fact, as the earlier

12

questions have indicated, that there is a structural

13

conflict.

14

MS. POSNER:

That's a structural conflict

15

that ERISA anticipates and, as the United States said in

16

its brief to this court in Pegram v. Herdrich, that

17

ERISA tolerates this dual role and this level of

18

conflict in order to keep these plans that are so vital

19

in our country's economic interests in underlying the

20

employee's well-being --

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You want us to write an

22

opinion to say that it's irrelevant that a company does

23

not have procedures to insulate the profit section from

24

the claims processing section?

25

MS. POSNER:

I'll use those terms.

No, Justice Kennedy, absolutely
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not.

2

a fiduciary that factor must be weighed, but it doesn't

3

change the abuse of discretion standard.

4

But what we are saying is that if there were such

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How does that work?

5

I don't understand.

You go through, you've got a

6

decision, whatever, it's a health insurance decision

7

that this procedure -- to determine that this procedure

8

is not covered under the, the plan, that the fiduciary

9

has the discretion to make that determination.

But you

10

say, aha, he's got a conflict of interest, so that's a

11

factor we take into account.

12

does that mean?

13

MS. POSNER:

Well, how does -- what

It means again, remembering

14

that these are claims under 29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(1)(B) for

15

benefits due under the terms of the plan, it's very

16

important that the courts remember to look at the terms

17

of those plans --

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All right, you've

19

got two cases, one where the person does not have a

20

conflict of interest under a particular plan, the other

21

where he does.

22

to cover this procedure.

23

each of those cases as a practical matter?

24
25

It's the same decision:

MS. POSNER:

We're not going

How is the review different in

As, as in trust law -- and if

you look at the cases in trust law, what the court needs
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to look at when the settlor, here the employer,

2

designates the discretionary authority under the terms

3

of the trust or the plan is that that conflict comes

4

into play if it seems that it's been breached.

5

also have to remember exactly what the purpose of the

6

trust is, and so you need to protect the employer's

7

interest in having benefits paid in meritorious cases

8

and not paid in nonmeritorious cases.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you

I guess I don't see

10

an answer to my question yet.

11

differ as a functional matter?

12

and says, well, normally that would be within the

13

discretion, but I've got to remember he's got a

14

conflict, so I'm going to determine that this particular

15

procedure should be covered because of the conflict.

16

MS. POSNER:

How does the review
He says he looks at it

It remains in the discretion

17

because this Court said that that freedom of contract

18

that's so important to ERISA, to keep the benefits, the

19

employers interested in offering benefits --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you're saying it

21

doesn't make any difference.

You say you should take it

22

into account, but if it was a reasoned decision, which

23

is the test whether or not he's a fiduciary, if it's a

24

reasoned decision the fact that he's a fiduciary makes

25

no difference, right?

Isn't that what you're saying?
9

MS. POSNER:

No, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It does make a decision

then.

simply by reason of the fact that he has a conflict?

What was a reasoned decision for someone who

Certainly not.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

MS. POSNER:

That's exactly my question.

Yes --

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

Again, it must

I'm going to let you answer

this question --

12

MS. POSNER:

And I --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I want you to work mine

14

in if you can.

The problem that I'm having is what to

15

say in the opinion.

16

yes, that's the way to put it as a standard.

17

also teach through example.

say:

19

of appeals opinion; it's perfect.

20

Firestone -- my opinion so far is two words:

21

"Firestone, perfect."

22

to say other than that?

23

MS. POSNER:

Now, could I say this?

Firestone,
You can

So I look at this case, I

You want to know what that means, read the court

Okay?

Okay?

So I've got

Now, what do you want me

In this case -- and this case I

24

think presents a very narrow question for the Court, and

25

that is where there is the dual role inherent in the

Alderson Reporting Company

plan but no evidence whatsoever that it infected the

2

decision, if it must be given weight in answer to the

3

Court's second question, then --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But then you come to the

5

end of the line.

You have to prove that the authority

was misused.

7

decision, what those judges were doing, they say we're

8

going to look at this with some skepticism because of

9

the conflict.

And as I understand the Sixth Circuit's

And let me give you a concrete example.

10

This woman got Social Security disability benefits and

11

she did it at the suggestion of MetLife is; that so?

12

MS. POSNER:

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

She actually applied herself.
But she got a lawyer that

they recommended that she have.
MS. POSNER:

15

MetLife recommended a lawyer to

16

her and also said she could use her own lawyer, which

17

was consistent with the plan design.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the point is they

19

came to her and said:

Get Social Security disability

20

benefits.

21

she is totally and permanently disabled.

Now, to get those she would have to show that

22

MS. POSNER:

Correct.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So here is a company that

24

says:

Tell the U.S. government that you are totally and

25

permanently disabled, but -- and then we'll recoup all
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that money that we paid out to you; but then when we get

2

a chance to look, look it over, we'll say you're not

3

disabled.

4

set of circumstances with suspicion?

5

MS. POSNER:

Why isn't it appropriate to regard just that

Because, Your Honor, at the

6

time that that letter was written to the Respondent here

7

in October of 2000, in fact MetLife had granted her

8

benefits.

9

their entitlement to Social Security is in fact not a

11

terms of a plan and it helps the employee as well.

12
13

It's a fiduciary obligation under the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, I'm not questioning

that at all.

14

MS. POSNER:

When --

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That sounds fine.

It's a

16

question of why, after helping her tell the government

17

that she was totally disabled, they, after the initial

18

two-year period, turned around and said she's not.

19

MS. POSNER:

The -- the reason is -- and

20

it's unfortunate that often Social Security makes the

21

same decision that the plan fiduciary has made two years

22

earlier, and the government is looking backwards at

23

certain evidence that may not be before the ERISA plan

24

fiduciary.

25

point is looking at that evidence at that time and at a

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ms. Posner, it seems to me

3

that that ought to be looked at with suspicion, whether

4

or not the person making the decision has a conflict.

5

mean that smells bad or doesn't smell bad, as you say,

6

either way.

7

MS. POSNER:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

I

Justice Scalia -And I am still -- listen, I

know that we're responsible for this because we said it

10

in Firestone.

We said that a conflict of interest

11

should be weighed as a factor.

12

it seems to me it means that sometimes that weight will

13

make the difference.

14

you're not willing to admit that -- at least sometimes

15

you would say, oh, yes, this is a reasonable decision

16

and had this decision been made by a fiduciary without a

17

conflict, it would be perfectly okay because it's

18

reasonable.

19

fiduciary has a conflict, what was a reasonable

20

decision, whoof, the added weight, it becomes an

21

unreasonable decision.

So at least sometimes -- but

That's the test.

22

MS. POSNER:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24
25

If that means anything,

However, since this

I think -Is that what you mean by

giving it some weight?
MS. POSNER:

Yes, Justice Scalia -13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

MS. POSNER:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You do.

But -So a perfectly reasonable

4

decision becomes unreasonable simply because you have a

5

conflict?

6

MS. POSNER:

It depends on how close that

7

reasonable decision is to the line, and in this case the

8

decision was not one that this mere dual-role conflict,

9

the lowest level of conflict that can exist, can push

10
11

that reasonable decision over.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

And I --

Okay, let's assume -- let's

12

assume that I'm reviewing it, and I -- I don't find it

13

as clear as you do, and I'm on the fence.

14

fence, may I take into consideration the fact that there

15

was a conflict of interest?

16

MS. POSNER:

17

you have to take that into account.

18

Being on the

You -- I think under Firestone

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And therefore I will say,

19

okay, I wouldn't know for sure how to go in this case,

20

but I see the conflict of interest and that's enough to

21

make me say more probably than not there was a

22

reflection of the self-interest of the provider, rather

23

than the interest of the -- of the insured here; and,

24

therefore, I'm going to find that the -- that the

25

conflict did disadvantage the person insured.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

That

Official - Subject to Final Review

would be, I take it on your view, a reasonable

application of Firestone.

Well, I just told you.

Yes.
I just told you how it

I'm sitting on the fence.

I'm not sure what

I take into consideration the fact that there is

10

conflicting interest here; and, therefore, I conclude

11

that the conflicting interest is the reason for the

decision and I hold against the company.

I thought your position in your brief was that there has

to be a demonstration that the conflict had an effect on

standard abuse of discretion --

MS. POSNER:

That's correct, Justice Alito.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

7

MS. POSNER:

-- the standard of review.

And I took Justice Souter's

hypothetical to mean that there had been a conflict that

9

seriously weighed on his view.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

10

No.

My hypothetical is the

hypothetical of the person making the decision.

12

myself in that person's position and I'm saying I can

13

think of reasons that might result in concluding that

14

this was a reasonable decision, period.

15

of reasons that might result in concluding that, in

fact, this was a decision that had been made against the

17

interest of the insured because the person making the

18

decision itself had an interest in it.

19

I put

And I can think

I'm not sure which way to go, but I now take

20

into consideration the fact that there was this

21

conflicting interest in the person or the organization

22

that made the decision, and for that reason, I am going

23

to -- I'm going to break the tie, and I'm going to

24

conclude that the conflict was to the disadvantage of

25

the insured.

I'm going to rule against the company.

It says that the plan administrator or the

terms of the plan, but that its decision may not be

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, Justice

Souter's question and Justice Alito's question highlight

10

for me what I think is the central issue.

11

Souter had asked you whether the conflict comes into

12

play, you know, when it's a tie.

13

the fence, and you say, well, the conflict's a factor,

14

so it tips over in the employee's favor.

15

Justice

And you're right on

Justice Alito's question asked you whether

16

or not the conflict has to play a role in the decision.

17

I don't know how that would be, but let's say, for

18

example, the insurance company is doing well and so they

19

say, well, we allow coverage for this procedure.

20

a sudden, the insurance company looks like it's not

21

doing so well, it's not going to meet the quarterly

22

targets or whatever, so it says, well, we're no longer

23

going to allow coverage for that procedure.

24

words, it is the conflict itself that affects which way

25

it comes out.

Now, which is right:

Justice Souter's case

2

in which the conflict tips the scales, no matter what

3

the reason is; or Justice Alito's case where the

4

conflict plays a role in the decision process?

5

MS. POSNER:

We believe that it's the

6

Justice Alito hypothetical, where it does play a role.

7

Where it doesn't play a role, it should have -- our

8

first answer -- our answer to the first question is it

9

should have no weight.

10
11

However, I understand that we've

moved beyond that to the second question.
JUSTICE ALITO:

But the problem with that is

the Court needs to know what the standard of review is

role in the outcome of a particular benefits

MS. POSNER:

And that's what I don't

No -- yes, Justice Alito, and I

think you hit the nail on the head there.

scrutinized for an abuse of discretion.

It's scrutinizing the merits of the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.

But as I understand

5

your brief, you say the conflict of interest is only

6

relevant if it affected the decision.

7

8

would go to that issue?

9

MS. POSNER:

But how does the

What sort of evidence

There are cases, Your Honor,

10

where can you see that, for instance, when you look at

11

the medical evidence, that the administrator shows in

12

its claim file, which, unlike any other area of the law,

13

the whole process is transparent under ERISA; and there

14

may really not be any evidence that's supporting it, or

15

so little that it's hard to understand how that

16

fiduciary could possibly have reached that decision.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, you're just saying

18

that the plaintiff has to have an overwhelming case.

19

don't think you'd need the conflict-of-interest point in

20

that kind of case.

21

MS. POSNER:

I

That's actually the standard,

22

though, Justice Stevens, in trust law also.

23

when you read these cases and you look at the examples

24

in the Restatement, when the trustee has an acknowledged

25

conflict and the settlor nevertheless vests in that
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Because

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

trustee discretionary authority, then in order for a

2

court to displace that trustee's judgment the court must

3

find that the trustee actually acted from conflict and

4

in controverse -- in contraverdia -- oh, my goodness --

5

and did not follow the terms of the plan.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, I can understand

7

that in normal trust situations, but it's hard for me to

8

understand how you're going to prove an insurance

9

company's particular claim adjustment was really

10

motivated by a conflict of interest rather than thinking

11

the claim wasn't valid.

12

MS. POSNER:

That is a problem, but the fact

13

of the matter is that you -- you read the cases and the

14

files, as I'm sure you have, and it's apparent that

It's the case that -- it's a

Third Circuit case from 2007 that the Respondent very

24

heavily relies upon, and it's a glaring example of

25

what's gone wrong in the analysis here, because in Post

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

v. Hartford there's a majority opinion that overruled

2

the Hartford's discretion based on minor irregularities,

3

what it called as minor irregularities, merely because

4

they existed.

5

The dissenting judge looked at the medicals

6

and, even under the Third Circuit's heightened scrutiny,

7

which automatically it applies to insurance companies

8

regardless of the situation, that justice said the

9

medical -- that judge, sorry -- said that the medical

10

evidence very clearly supported the Hartford's decision.

11

And what we are hoping will come out of

12

this, Your Honors, is that in fashioning what should

13

happen in these cases, that the fact that these are

14

claims for benefits under the terms of the plan must

15

really be important, not just minor irregularities and

16

whether this was done right or that was done right.

17

That's -- that's a cause of action under -- under

18

1132(a)(2), and the Respondents are relying very heavily

19

on the replacement of the fiduciary, of the trustee.
That's not the issue here.

That's an (a)(2)

claim under 1109 where you could replace the fiduciary.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

this that I don't understand.

swiftly in Judge Merritt's separate opinion.

4

one point there was a proposal by MetLife that they give

5

this woman a trial run at a sedentary job to see if she

could do it.

7

to him, and it was MetLife's proposal, but then it got

8

withdrawn.

9

There's one feature of
It was referred to very
He said at

And he said that that made a lot of sense

Could you clarify what that was?
MS. POSNER:

Yes.

I believe, Justice

10

Ginsburg, that Judge Merritt was looking at a provision

11

of the plan that -- actually, I'll tell you where it is.

12

It's at 170a of the joint appendix.

13

allows rehabilitative employment for a disabled person.

14

In early 2002, MetLife did refer the file to a

15

vocational rehabilitation specialist to determine

16

whether or not the Respondent was eligible for that.

17

And that provision

In doing that, a letter was sent to the

18

treating physician, Dr. Patel, asking specifically what

19

she could do in an eight-hour day; could she do

20

full-time sedentary work; and if there were any physical

21

barriers.

22

it was not a form -- which he filled out and said in an

23

eight-hour day she could sit for eight hours; she could

24

stand for four hours; and she could walk for two hours;

25

that she could do full-time, sedentary work, and that

And that's that March 12th, 2002, letter --

there were no physical barriers otherwise blocking her

2

ability to do that.

withdraw that proposal?

MS. POSNER:

Then why did MetLife

Well, there was no proposal,

6

Your Honor, but it was given to a rehabilitation

7

specialist to work that up to see if she was disabled

8

and eligible for rehabilitative employment, because her

9

treating physician responded to that inquiry by saying

10

she could do sedentary work, she retained that physical

11

capacity, which was consistent with what he said in

January of '02 and again in June of '02.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This Court got it right in Firestone when it

5

said, of course a conflict must be weighed.

There's no

6

reason for this Court to overrode its well-reasoned and

7

unanimous conclusion which --

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Dictum.

9

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

It was dictum, Your Honor,

10

but it was very well-considered dictum because --

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

-- the only issue before

13

the Court so far as the parties thought was what is the

14

effect of this dual role that Firestone had?

15

Court did not answer that question, but that's what the

16

parties were arguing about.

17

So this Court correctly discerned the rule

18

from trust law.

ERISA's policies and, if anything --

What I don't like about the

dictum is I don't know what it means.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think it's lovely to say

24

weigh it as a factor, it gets the case off our docket

25

and it's fine.

But what does it mean?
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does it mean that a

3

perfectly reasonable decision that is within the

4

discretion -- I mean this plan says that MetLife will

5

have -- knowing that it will have the conflict, that

6

they will make the decisions and so long as they are not

7

arbitrary, they are valid.

8
9

Now, let's take a perfectly reasonable
decision.

It is not arbitrary.

Does giving weight to

10

the existence of the conflict which the settlor of the

11

plan expected to exist, does giving weight to that mean

12

that what was reasonable becomes unreasonable?

13

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, the answer --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If it doesn't mean that,

15

then it means nothing.

16

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

17

The answer is yes in many circumstances.

18

of the Court's invocation of trust law is that trust law

19

answers the question.

20

a fiduciary with a conflict, you apply especially

21

careful scrutiny.

22

Absolutely, Your Honor.
And the beauty

Trust law says that when you have

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but trust law

23

doesn't take into account what we have said repeatedly

24

in our ERISA decisions, which is we want to encourage

25

people to set up ERISA plans.

And that has affected the

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

standards that we've adopted, for example, that we even

2

allow a conflict of interest like this to exist.

3

And it seems to me that your position is

4

going to hurt beneficiaries under ERISA plans because

5

people are going to say, as they're perfectly free to

6

do -- people, the employers, are going to say, as they

7

are perfectly free to do, you know, I'm just not going

8

to do it; if we're going to have judges looking at these

9

claims decisions on a de novo basis, who knows how much

10

it'll end up costing me, so I'm not going to set up

11

these plans.

12

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, I understand,

13

and this Court considered that in Firestone, the

14

litigation cost and the added administrative costs, and

15

this Court concluded en route to de novo review that the

16

1132(a)(1)(B) remedy is so infused with the interests of

17

ensuring that the beneficiaries get their benefits due,

18

that that is the interest that the courts weigh most in

19

determining the standard of review.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you -- which

21

position do you adopt?

It was only posed as

22

hypothetical, so I don't mean to attribute the position

23

to you; but the Justice Souter hypothetical or the

24

Justice Alito hypothetical?

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, the answer is

circumstances.

3

does is to say we apply especially careful scrutiny.

4

And the scrutiny has to be consonant with the purpose of

5

the scrutiny, which is to ensure that the conflicted

6

fiduciary does not end up subconsciously or consciously

7

tilting the scale.

8
9

They can happen under both circumstances -But let me explain why.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What trust law

Well, that sounds

like the Justice Alito hypothetical.

In other words,

10

the extra scrutiny has to be consonant with the purpose.

11

The purpose is to protect against the conflict.

12

the scrutiny doesn't reveal that the conflict played a

13

role, then it's -- then it's not an abuse of discretion.

14

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

So if

No, Your Honor, because

15

what trust law says is that you apply especially careful

16

scrutiny, which entails two things.

17

what this Court called keeping the judicial eye peeled

18

for conflict of interest in Rush.

19

examination of the record of the decisionmaking process.

20

You kick the tires, you test the judgments, as the Sixth

21

Circuit did in this case, and you ask yourself, is this

22

the work of an unbiased fiduciary?

23

The first thing is

So that's an

The second thing is to imagine a zone of

24

reasonableness within which a reasonably prudent trustee

25

might land and then say to yourself at the outer limits
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the zone of reasonableness, we will accept the

2

judgment of an unconflicted fiduciary because there is

3

no reason for us to suspect that he reached that result

4

because of the bias.

5

contract that zone of reasonableness.

6

For a conflicted fiduciary you can

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Trust law doesn't say.

7

Trust law does not establish a different standard of

8

judicial review for the conflicted trustee.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, it absolutely

10

does, and the 26 law professors in the amicus brief that

11

they filed with this Court explain exactly --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I don't know what to

13

look to in trust law.

I mean, all that's happened here,

14

every life insurance -- every company, every life

insurance company has the kind of conflict that you're

16

talking about.

you're talking about.

And an automobile company might

How does trust law keep that kind of

20
21

conflict?

22

looked it up, I think, that trust law says that every

23

distribution by a trustee whose own fee depends on the

24

size of the trust is conflicted.

25

Now, it can't be and it isn't, because I've

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Absolutely --

Alderson Reporting Company

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

I doubt, since banks are

trustees, I doubt but I'm not sure here -- -

3

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- that banks are

5

trustees -- suppose you were to say, look, the bank has

6

an interest in maximizing the amount of money in its

7

account and therefore every decision of a distribution

8

of such trustee is subject to some special thing.

9

Now, the problem for me in this case is what

10

in trust law do I analogize it to, not -- I don't doubt

11

for a second the 26 law professors, et cetera -- though

12

I do really sometimes, but not in this case.

13

(Laughter.)

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

The -- the -- so what do I

15

look to?

And where I ended up was I'd like an answer to

what I asked the other side.

17

better than Firestone, I ought to write two words in

20

read the opinion below.

Okay?

I ended up, I can't do

21

Now, what's your view on all of that?

22

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

So let me break it down and

23

first turn to the premise.

24

that every employer is conflicted.

25

It is simply not correct

JUSTICE BREYER:

I overstated.

gave.

It's an ordinary insurance policy.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Okay.

But the bank

5

example, Your Honor, that is not a pressure, which is

6

kind of a business pressure, that trust law recognizes

7

as a conflict of interest.

8

trustees are often, almost always, in the business of

9

administering trusts, and they don't -- they make their

Trust law acknowledges that

11

are talking here about a direct impact on the bottom

12

line.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

The big difference is we

But that's, you see, their

14

point.

Their point is this is just an ordinary

15

insurance company, an ordinary policy, and it's really

16

like a bank that's a trustee that in fact takes money

17

that hasn't been distributed and puts it on its own

18

account.

19

is a conflict.

They make money for that, from that.

So there

20

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

You have that kind of

22

conflict.

2

The insurance industry makes its money on the

3

differential between the premiums that it charges and

it at more money.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:
example from real life.

But -- So let me give an

MetLife, for example, shells

10

out $14 billion a year in ERISA covered claims.

If it

11

denies one out of a hundred claims improperly, we are

12

talking about $140 million.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, and Chase Manhattan

14

bank has $14 trillion in trust accounts, and if they

15

just put in for three days money into an

16

interest-bearing account and lend it out for five

17

minutes, they will make $1 billion.

18

they are finding these kinds of conflicts everywhere.

19

And that's what I'm asking you.

20

Okay.

You see,

What I think if I were to add something I'd

21

say, look at this carefully, judge, look at it

22

carefully; but if all you find is an ordinary insurance

23

company doing ordinary work and there is no ground for

24

suspicion, proceed to step two.

25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

What about that?

Well, Your Honor, the first

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

thing to say is that -- if that is, in fact, an

2

authorized transaction, that would fall under the

3

self-dealing rules of trust law, and trust law

4

self-dealing rules are situations in which the set law

5

has actually suspended the duty of loyalty of the

6

trustee -- that's correct -- of the trustee.

7

That is absolutely impermissible under

8

ERISA.

You cannot suspend the duty of loyalty under

There is a clear provision about that.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

In -- in case number two, there -- there is

what you referred to as a decision within the zone of

reasonableness, but instead of being sort of in the core

of the center of the zone of reasonableness, it's close

to the edge.

say look, I wasn't born yesterday; the reason it's so

close to the edge is that they were giving way to their

decide for the beneficiary and against the company.

Case number three is the case of the person

you're making, that the question in all of these cases

clause, is the reasonableness of the administrator's

determination.

That is the ultimate inquiry, and there

are any number of other facts and circumstances that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. SAHARSKY:

I don't know --

Well, this is a standard that

comes from trust law, the reasonableness standard, and

this Court has recognized similar standards in all

22

different areas of the law where they've talked about --

discretion review --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I don't mind

45
Alderson Reporting Company

reasonableness and I don't mind abuse of discretion.

But you're telling me that even when the reasonableness

standard is met, if there is this conflict, if it's

close -- how close is close?

it's -- it's beautiful art, but I don't understand how

it turns into law.

You -- suddenly it flops

MS. SAHARSKY:

In every case, the court

9

would need to make a decision about reasonableness, and

10

in the cases where there is a conflict of interest that

needs to be weighed what the court would do is take a

close look at the administrator's rationale --

MS. SAHARSKY:

First of all, this Court

framework for the de novo default standard of review and

what should happen in the case of a discretionary

determination where the plan confers discretion --

MS. SAHARSKY:

Why --

-- that review should be

under the trust law standard.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If we look at Firestone,

it's rather laconic.

ordinarily, if you don't have this discretionary

authority, it's de novo review.

I don't see

Official - Subject to Final Review

that it says anything more than that.

2

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, both on pages 111 and

3

on 115, this Court was looking to the law of trusts.

4

There's a more extensive discussion on page 111, where

5

it says, for example, "If the trustee is given power to

6

construe disputed or doubtful terms, in such

7

circumstances the trustee's interpretation will not be

8

disturbed if reasonable."

9

that abuse of discretion reasonableness standard, the

And then on page 115, using

10

Court said "If there is a benefit plan that gives

11

discretion to an administrator that is operating under a

12

conflict, the conflict must be weighed as a factor."

13

And Firestone told this Court to look to

14

trust law and trust law -- we think the best examples

15

there are the situations of a trustee who is also a

16

beneficiary or a trustee who is also a remainderman.

company -- I'll just repeat my earlier question -- has

done the best that it can do to have a firewall,

20

independence and so forth.

not the less deferential standard of review is invoked?

I think that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. SAHARSKY:

It's not reasonableness.
The conflict is one of many

factors like the Social Security Administration's

determination and how it was treated in this case that

suggests that the plan administrator's determination was

10

unreasonable.

I can't tell you that it weighs 10

percent or 20 percent in every case.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AMY K. POSNER

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

21

MS.

POSNER:

Thank you Your Honor.

On

22

question one, I think it's important to know that the

23

zone of reasonableness and the size of the field is set

24

forth by the employer when it designates discretionary

25

authority and says that the standard of review is an
54

1

arbitrary and capricious one in court, which is the same

2

in ERISA as an abuse-of-discretion standard.

3

And the -- and the fact that's common and

4

known to the employer in setting forth that standard,

5

that there is this dual role, shouldn't change that

6

analysis at all, nor should it come into play in any

7

significant way whatsoever in these decisions.

8

on question two, if there is a conflict that influence,

9

that's not what the employer was anticipating.

But

And so

10

it -- it changes the size of the permissible field.

11

to get to Justice Scalia's point, the actual conflict

12

there does matter because it changes the size of the

13

field.

It's not what the employer was intending in its

14

plan.

Now, if -- also on question two, if you view this

15

as a --

employer.

23

Question one, we are saying at that point it doesn't
