CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

4

argument first this morning in Case 06-1666, and the

5

consolidated Case 07-394, Munaf versus Geren, Secretary

6

of the Army, and Geren versus Omar.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

9

ON BEHALF OF PETE GEREN,

10
11
12
13

SECRETARY OF THE ARMY, ET AL.
MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Under this Court's precedents and universal

14

international law norms, the government of Iraq, like

15

all sovereign nations, has a sovereign right and

16

jurisdiction to try and punish individuals, including

17

American citizens, who voluntarily enter its borders,

18

commit crimes in its country, and remain there.

19

independent respects, the court of appeals in the Omar

20

case lost sight of that principle and departed from this

21

Court's precedents:

22

jurisdiction at all; and second by sustaining an

23

injunction that the court of appeals itself recognized

24

prevented the government of Iraq from trying and

25

punishing Mr. Omar for any crimes that he committed in

In two

First by exercising habeas

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Iraq.

2

As to the jurisdictional question, we

3

believe that this Court's decision Hirota versus

4

MacArthur points to the conclusion that habeas

5

jurisdiction is lacking over these cases because the

6

habeas petitioners are being held under international

7

authority pursuant to determinations made by an

8

international Multinational Force acting and carrying

9

out a United Nations mandate, and in Mr. Munaf's case

10

pursuant to an order of the Iraqi courts that he remain

11

in custody while proceedings go forward in the trial

12

court.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't the problem with the

14

argument that Hirota did not at any point in the per

15

curiam opinion saying -- say, we're coming to the

16

conclusion that we come to of no jurisdiction because

17

there's an international force?

18

you know, there's this, that, and the other thing, and

19

under all these circumstances we don't think there's

20

jurisdiction.

21

here is you had Japanese soldiers in Hirota and you've

22

got American citizens here.

23

I mean, Hirota said,

Well, one of the things that's different

MR. GARRE:

Well, that is the difference,

24

Justice Souter.

And I think, to be clear, if this Court

25

does find jurisdiction in these cases, we think that
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

citizenship would be a basis -- would have to be the

2

basis for jurisdiction, and we urge this Court to limit

3

its decision to that ruling, because that would have

4

profound practical consequences.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's another

6

difference, too.

7

in Hirota, here in Omar's case he has not yet been as

8

far as we know even investigated by the Iraqi courts,

9

certainly no conviction; and in Munaf's case the

10

There was a conviction and a sentence

conviction has been quashed.

11

MR. GARRE:

That's true, and let me explain

12

why we think that Hirota does govern the circumstances

13

in this case, notwithstanding that this case involves

14

citizens and notwithstanding that the Petitioners in

15

Hirota had been the subject of an international

16

conviction.

17

would have come out differently if the habeas

18

petitioners had filed suit earlier and sought to enjoin

19

the international proceeding in Hirota and sought an

20

injunction that would have prevented the conviction from

21

taking case.

22

First of all, we don't think that Hirota

Secondly, we do think that, although one

23

obviously has to take a careful look at the Court's

24

decision in Hirota, we think that what the Court did say

25

points to the conclusion that it was the international
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

authority that was key to the Court's finding that there

2

was no jurisdiction.

3

--

4

I think there's at least a couple

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If it is, there's

5

something -- the implication of that I think is what is

6

bothersome, because in effect it means, if that rule is

7

applied to this case, it means that the president acting

8

alone can make an agreement for an international force

9

or a cooperative force and that agreement of the

10

executive alone in effect eliminates habeas jurisdiction

11

over an American citizen.

12

tension, if not inconsistent, with the suspension clause

13

and it's a little scary.

14

MR. GARRE:

And that obviously is in

Well, obviously the Court

15

reached that conclusion in Hirota as to aliens.

16

respect to citizens, I think that the key for the

17

jurisdictional question under the habeas statute is

18

whether or not these individuals are in custody under

19

and by color of United States authority.

20

Court presumably concluded in Hirota that the

21

petitioners in Hirota were not under custody under color

22

of United States authority, we think that the

23

Petitioners here are not.

24
25

With

Just as the

And so we think --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but in real world terms

isn't it the case that they are under United States
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

authority?

You've got an American commander, you've

2

straight-line authority right through, and -- and one

3

knows -- to be realistic, one knows perfectly well that

4

if any order were given to the American military

5

involved, they would not hand them over, i.e., they

6

would obey the order, international -- agreement for

7

international cooperation or not.

8

MR. GARRE:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:
MR. GARRE:

10

If I can make -Go ahead.

-- two points in response to

11

that.

First, ultimately the United Nations controls the

12

strings and the source and the scope of international

13

authority.

14

resolutions are set to expire in December.

15

it could eliminate those resolutions today and that

16

source of international authority would exist and we

17

wouldn't be here arguing that these individuals are

18

being held pursuant to international mandate.

19

The -- the current Security Council

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It could --

Mr. Garre, just to

20

clarify one point.

The -- at the time of the briefing,

21

the U.N. resolution was due to expire in December of

22

2007.

Has it been renewed.

23

MR. GARRE:

There has been a subsequent

24

resolution.

It's Resolution 1790, and that resolution

25

is set to expire this December.

And the -- the

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

government of Iraq and the other parties have indicated

2

that this will be the last extension.

3

they'll have to assess the situation in December.

4

the international authority that existed at the time of

5

the briefing continues to exist.

6

Obviously,
But

The other point I was going to make,

7

Justice Souter, is your point about American domination

8

or influence over the Multinational Force was equally

9

true with respect to the force in Hirota.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

10
11

I think -- I think you're

right.

12
13

You had --

MR. GARRE:

So I don't think that that's a

basis for distinguishing Hirota.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The --

It may be -- I mean, Hirota

15

was a literally, I think, a two- or three-day per curiam

16

opinion.

17

kind of whole ball of wax sort of reasoning involved in

18

it.

It occupied less than a page, and it had this

19

And as precedential authority, if this case

20

turned on the question of whether we look to the theory

21

of international authority rather than, I think, the

22

realistic fact of American domination, I don't think

23

Hirota is a very strong precedent against our at least

24

taking the realistic view of it.

25

MR. GARRE:

Well, again, I think that Hirota
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- the amount of influence that the United States forces

2

have over the international force isn't a basis for

3

distinguishing Hirota.

4

But to get to your point about citizenship,

5

I guess we would say a few things.

One, we that think

6

the Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion in Hirota

7

and the court of appeals below recognized that the

8

theory of the Court's decision in Hirota doesn't lend

9

itself to a citizenship exception.

The habeas statute,

10

as this Court emphasized in the Rasul case, doesn't have

11

a citizenship -- doesn't distinguish between citizens

12

and aliens, and it has since 1789 contained the

13

requirement that the person be in custody under or by

14

color of United States' authority.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

So -So once again you're

relying on a concurring opinion by Justice Douglas?

17

MR. GARRE:

Not the concurring opinion.

18

We're relying on the Court's decision in Hirota, but we

19

look at the concurring opinion; we've looked at the

20

briefs.

21

law from that decision.

22

it stands for is that where individuals are held under

23

international authority by the judgment of several

24

nations, not the law of any single nation, this Court

25

lacks jurisdiction to review the custody of such

We've tried to discern the best principle of
And the principle that we think

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

individuals.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Garre, it is at least

3

equally plausible, I think, because it's the only factor

4

that Hirota mentions more than once, that the Court was

5

going on its lack of power "to review, to affirm, set

6

aside, or annul the judgments and sentences imposed"

7

there.

And here we have no judgment or sentence.

8
9

So I don't think you can pick one of these
strands, citizenship, and say, oh, that's it and it

10

isn't the judgment and sentence.

11

your position.

12

foregoing circumstances."

13

much further than saying citizenship was one of those

14

circumstances.

This is an opinion that says "under the

MR. GARRE:

15

So I think we know

I don't think you can take it

If I can make a couple of

16

points.

One, the parties in Hirota, the habeas

17

petitioners, made very clear that they weren't asking

18

this Court to review the international conviction.

19

made very clear that they were asking this Court to

20

review the actions of American officers under United

21

States law.

22

merits brief, where they said -- and I'm quoting here --

23

"We are not asking this Court to review the decision of

24

international court" -- end quote.

25

"All the questions deal solely with official actions

They

They made that clear on page 14 of their

11
Alderson Reporting Company

And quoting again:

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

taken by General MacArthur as citizen and U.S. Army

2

officer." -- end quote.

3

"We repeat again that we bring into question only

4

unlawful action taken by General MacArthur for us."

5

And again on page 15, quote:

The other point that I would make is these

6

individuals -- they haven't been convicted pursuant to a

7

trial, like the individuals in Hirota, but these

8

individuals are being held pursuant to determinations

9

made by the Multinational Force carrying out the

10
11

international mandate.
In Mr. Omar's case, he not only received a

12

three-judge tribunal shortly after his detention and

13

capture, but he also received a determination before a

14

nine-officer combined review release board, consisting

15

of six Iraqi officials and three Multinational Force

16

officials, who determined that he was a security

17

internee who should be detained in accordance with the

18

United Nations mandate.

19

Now, Mr. Munaf's case did proceed before the

20

Iraqi criminal court because an injunction was not

21

entered against those proceedings.

22

initially did enter a conviction.

23

reversed on appeal by the court of cassation.

24

that -- that the recent decision is significant in a

25

couple of respects.

The Iraqi court
That conviction was
We think

I think, one, it underscores there
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is an Iraqi legal system, that that system is capable of

2

processing these cases and hearing from these

3

individuals, and is capable of granting relief where

4

appropriate action isn't taken.

5

And, two, the Iraqi court order setting

6

aside the conviction, much like an appellate order in

7

this country would, remanded the case for further

8

proceedings but directed that Mr. Munaf and his

9

codefendant --

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If it's in the materials,

11

then perhaps I should have known, but did the -- I take

12

it Munaf was present and was represented by counsel?

13

MR. GARRE:

Yes, both.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But how did that work?

15

Was he present in American custody and then he goes to

16

the Iraqi court?

17

MR. GARRE:

The individuals are detained by

18

the Multinational Force while there are proceedings

19

before the Iraqi court --

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So then he just goes every

21

day to the Iraqi court and then he comes back at night

22

to U.S. custody?

23

MR. GARRE:

Yes.

In Mr. Munaf's case, there

24

were four investigative hearings and a trial, after

25

which he was convicted.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

In Mr. Omar's case, if he were -- if the

2

proceedings were allowed to go forward, he would remain

3

in MNF-I custody during the course of the Iraqi

4

proceedings.

5

that conviction is sustained on appeal, the Iraqi

6

government issues an order, a transfer order, to the

7

Multinational Force.

8

determination to carry out that order.

9

And then, if there is a conviction and

The Multinational Force makes a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

MR. GARRE:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There are --

And, again -There are in the U.S.

12

custody a number of non-citizens.

13

people are being held in the custody of

14

the Multinational Force that the United States controls?
MR. GARRE:

15

Is that -- how many

There are 24,000 people

16

currently being held by the Multinational Force, the

17

vast majority of whom obviously are aliens.

18

thousand individuals held by the Multinational Force

19

have been transferred to Iraqi custody.

20

most of those individuals have undergone court

21

proceedings because the Multinational Force is obviously

22

working in close coordination with the Iraqi government

23

to bring to justice people who have committed crimes in

24

Iraq.

25

Two

Many if not

And if I could turn to the second question,
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

because we think that there is -JUSTICE BREYER:

One more -- I'd like -- on

3

the first question, in reading through this, my

4

impression was that the government -- and the green

5

briefs, you know, the dark green briefs against you from

6

the Military Justice Institute and the national security

7

specialists really don't disagree.

8

everybody seems to agree, to use the words General Casey

9

said, that U.S. soldiers in Iraq are subject to the

That is that

10

authority, direction, and control of the commander of

11

the U.S. Central Command.

12

that really this multilateral force operates subject to

13

a unified American command, and the chain of command

14

ultimately runs to the President.

15

matter it's the President and the Pentagon, the

16

Secretary of Defense, and the American commanders that

17

control what our American soldiers do.

18

And you say in your brief

So as a practical

I take it there's agreement on that point,

19

but where there's disagreement is that you say, well,

20

the same was true with that tribunal at issue in Hirota.

21

Am I right about that?

22

MR. GARRE:

23
24
25

We say the same is true with

respect to the allied forces -JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

So we're not -- we're

not -- I take its you say that, as a practical matter
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and as a matter of the chain of command, it runs through

2

American officers to American commanders to the

3

Secretary of Defense to the President of the United

4

States.

5

there?

There is no disagreement about that, or is

6
7

MR. GARRE:

There is not, Justice Breyer.

An American --

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. GARRE:

10

There is not.

-- official has the supreme

command --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Okay.

Then if there

12

is not -- if there is not, am I right in thinking the

13

issue is whether, because the words -- there's some

14

connection with foreign governments, absolutely.

15

There's some, but it doesn't interfere with that chain

16

of command.

17

true with the tribunal at issue in Hirota.

18
19

And now your point is:

MR. GARRE:

The same was true with respect

not only to the tribunal, but the allied forces --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. GARRE:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23
24
25

But the same was

Yes, yes.

-- in Hirota.
The same was true.

It was

General MacArthur.
MR. GARRE:

That's correct.

And ultimately

the key point, we think, is that those forces were
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

acting under international mandate.

2

Commission in Hirota ultimately had say over what the

3

force could do --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. GARRE:

6

The Far Eastern

Well --

-- whereas the United Nations

here ultimately has.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

But that's because the

8

President, I take it, would follow what the UN says, not

9

because the chain of command would change.
MR. GARRE:

10

Well, I think that that's true,

11

but the point I wanted to make is that the United

12

Nations today could repeal the resolutions authorizing

13

this international force and the specific mission.

14
15

JUSTICE BREYER:

And if that happened, these

people would be released?

16

MR. GARRE:

They would be under the

17

authority of the United States.

18

arguing that this Court didn't have jurisdiction.

19

ultimately, an international body distinct from the

20

United States is controlling the strings --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

We wouldn't be here
So,

But the relevance of that

22

is General MacArthur was an agent of several allied

23

powers.

24
25

MR. GARRE:
Petraeus.

As is, in our view, General

He is sharing now the authority -17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then, to me, it's a matter

2

of Hirota at the moment, and the only distinction you

3

haven't addressed is at that time, I think in 1946, the

4

basic habeas rule was that you wouldn't question a

5

judgment of a tribunal, at least not a foreign tribunal.

6

And it was just beginning in the issue -- to question

7

judgments in American tribunals.

8

obvious question is:

9

And, therefore, the

Well, doesn't that explain Hirota?

MR. GARRE:

I don't think it does, for the

10

reasons that I have already indicated to

11

Justice Ginsburg.

12

were making in Hirota.

13

say that they weren't challenging the international

14

conviction, that they were challenging the actions of

15

the American officers acting under international law.

16

That wasn't the argument the parties
They went out of their way to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the Court certainly

17

listed it as a circumstance; and, as I said before, it's

18

the only thing that's repeated in the opinion.

19

think that we've come to a standoff on that.
MR. GARRE:

20
21

It did.

And if I could turn now

to the second issue, because we do think there is a --

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask just one

23

question.

24

of detention was in the United States?

25

But I

Would your argument be the same if the place

MR. GARRE:

Analytically, it would be the
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

same, Justice Stevens.

2

States forces don't act under international authority;

3

and, thank goodness, Multinational Forces don't act in

4

the United States.

5

As a practical matter, United

It would make a difference as to the second

6

question, which is to say if the individuals were

7

detained in the United States and there was a question

8

of transferring back to Iraq, that would be a classic

9

extradition situation.

And we'd have a whole different

10

body of case law governing these individuals --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I suppose if he

12

were -- it would make a huge difference whether such an

13

individual were released in the United States as opposed

14

to being released in Iraq.

15

MR. GARRE:

Absolutely.

In Iraq it's

16

undisputed that if the Multinational Force were to

17

release them, the Iraqi authorities could arrest them,

18

take them into their custody.

19

face today is one preventing the Iraqi courts from going

20

forward with any proceedings against Mr. Omar,

21

preventing the Multinational Force from sharing

22

information with Iraqi authorities about the

23

circumstances of his release, and directly preventing

24

the Multinational Force from transferring these

25

individuals to Iraqi custody if they are convicted.

The injunction that we

be made about a claim of torture if there is at least

22

enough color in the claim to say there's something to

23

inquire into?

24
25

MR. GARRE:

Justice Souter, the courts have recognized that these

Our position, Your Honor, is that it is

25

problems with Hirota were these:

Nothing in General MacArthur's status as an

American officer would have transformed those

Nothing in General MacArthur's status would have

transformed their complaint as something other than an

attack on the judgment and sentences of an international

tribunal imposed upon them.

8

what the Court said in its nine sentences in Hirota,

9

that it was an attack on the judgment and sentences

10

That, in fact, is exactly

imposed upon them by an international tribunal.
And lastly, vis a vis the narrow question

12

before the Court in Hirota, nothing in General

MacArthur's status would have made this anything other

14

than an improper attempt to invoke the original and

10

not believe the United States makes that instruction to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you're making this

distinction now.

Justice Kennedy asked you does -- does

14

your case turn on citizenship, and you said citizenship

15

is very important.

16

MR. MARGULIES:

Yes.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There are thousands of

18

noncitizens that are being held in the very same

19

circumstance.

20

MR. MARGULIES:

Your Honor, there are

21

important reasons embedded in the laws of war that

22

authorize the United States in this context to transfer

23

foreign nationals back -- in this case the overwhelming

25

Iraqi government, that the laws of war do not allow

That is a distinction.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Margulies, the prologue

3

to the Constitution does say "to preserve the blessings

4

of liberty to ourselves and our posterity."

5

something to the notion, isn't there, that the

6

Constitution provides constitutional rights, including

7

the right to the writ of habeas corpus, to Americans or

8

to anyone who is in America; but to say that the whole

9

world has rights under the Constitution is extravagant.

10

MR. MARGULIES:

There is

I take no position on

11

whether it's extravagant, Your Honor, but I certainly

12

take the position that that's not what we argue.

13

there are grounds -- there are grounds predicated on the

14

laws of war, on the terms of the extradition treaty, on

15

the possible application of the Fifth Amendment, that

16

simply make differentiation between citizens and

17

non-citizens.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

So a habeas court

19

here has to look at all those different factors and come

20

to a determination of whether it has jurisdiction?

21

There's no bright line?

22

hostilities have ceased or haven't ceased?

23

look at how far the prisoners have been removed from the

24

zone of hostility?

25

MR. GARRE:

No.

It's got to

No, emphatically not, Your

35
Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So what is the

3

bright line that determines whether there's habeas

4

jurisdiction or not?

5

MR. MARGULIES:

Control.

That is what

6

habeas turns on, Your Honor.

7

that we propose, which is the one that has been followed

8

by this Court --

9

And the bright-line test

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the control in

10

the middle of a zone of hostilities of a foreign

11

national allows -- creates habeas jurisdiction?

12

your bright line?

13

MR. MARGULIES:

That's

No, I'm sorry, Your Honor.

14

What I mean to suggest, the rule that I propose -- the

15

rule that I propose is that when a U.S. citizen is

16

detained abroad by U.S. military officials who have

17

effective authority and control over his continued

18

detention, that citizen can invoke the jurisdiction of

19

the United States district court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

Well, then it's not

21

just control.

22

the questions Justice Stevens was raising.

23

It looks to citizenship, which brings up

MR. MARGULIES:

Yes, Your Honor, and I

24

apologize.

What I said at the outset is that this is a

25

test which turns on the jurisdictional facts that I have
36
Alderson Reporting Company

identified, which is when a citizen is detained by the

2

U.S. military abroad and the military has effective

3

control.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do we have any -- any

5

precedent in our cases for saying that that test would

6

apply during an active combat in a zone of hostilities?

7

MR. MARGULIES:

Toth v. Quarles, of course,

8

Your Honor, involved a person who was brought from the

9

United States to Korea when there was still hostilities

10

ongoing.

What I'm

a spectrum and on one side is the military occupation of

12

Japan, where there is basically peace but it's a

13

military occupation.

14

or a guerilla war where the U.S. forces are rounding up

15

troops, nightly perhaps, and rounding up guerillas.

16

I had put this case quite close to the military

17

occupation in my mind because of the nature of these

18

particular individuals' offense and treatment.

19

I wrong to do that?

20

either a hot war or at least a guerilla warfare, where

21

troops are actively engaged in rounding up those who

want to shoot them?

they said, we have lost interest in him; we're releasing

transfer is one thing and saying you're free to go and

3

Why -- why do you equate the two?

4

MR. MARGULIES:

Because, Your Honor, we

5

think that the district court can order, under 28 U.S.C.

7

rather, relief that gives effect to the contours of the

right.

unlawful.

In other words, of course, if there's been a

unlawful or not.

MR. MARGULIES:

The legal basis is they

question:

they have no authority to enter it as a preliminary

21

matter.

22

I think on the jurisdictional point, the one

23

point I wanted to stress is that if this Court does find

jurisdiction we think it has to be because of a reading
