ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT D. MAKAR

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. MAKAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The virtues of reading Congress' grant of

12

the stamp tax exemption, 1146(c), to only

13

post-confirmation transfers is threefold.

14

faithful to the language of the statute, which requires

15

that there be a plan confirmed, as the courts in NVR and

16

Hechinger have held, and draws a simple bright-line test

17

at the point of confirmation, at which point the

18

bankruptcy judge has the power to grant that tax

19

exemption.

20

First, it's

It's also based upon the principle that

21

taxation exemption statutes, which this is a case

22

involving one, must be narrowly construed if they are to

23

stay under principles of federalism.

24

intrusion into the State's tax system, keeping in mind

25

the important fact that approximately three-quarters of
3
Alderson Reporting Company

It also avoids the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

these Chapter 11 cases never get to plan confirmation.

2

Instead, in three quarters of the cases you have, as in

3

Lamie and in the Hartford case, you may have a case

4

convert to Chapter 7 or have it be dismissed.

5

So a pre-confirmation tax exemption granted

6

by the bankruptcy judge at any point prior to

7

confirmation --

8
9
10

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't understand that.

If it's never confirmed, then I guess the tax is okay,
isn't it?

11

MR. MAKAR:

Well, Justice Breyer, what

12

happens in these situations is that a -- for example, a

13

363 sale order where the property is being sold, in that

14

order there is an exemption granted by the bankruptcy

15

judge.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

But so what?

Isn't that --

17

I mean, I assume that's totally illegal, that you get --

18

I thought we're talking about this provision where

19

everybody agrees that it has to be under a plan

20

confirmed under section 1129.

21

confirmed, I don't know how you would fall within this

22

exemption.

23
24
25

MR. MAKAR:

So if there's no plan

Well, that's our point exactly,

Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Fine.
4

Alderson Reporting Company

If it's your point

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

exactly, then I guess I must agree with that.

2

from the other side.

3

makes it difference whether the transfer takes place

4

before the plan is confirmed or after.

5

confused about that.

6

I'll hear

Except I thought your point was it

MR. MAKAR:

So I may be just

Well, what happens in these

7

situations before confirmation where there is a 363

8

order that transfers, that the bankruptcy court then

9

says this is entitled to an exemption, at that point in

10

time the State of Florida or whatever State is denied

11

the revenue that would otherwise --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, no, I'm asking you

13

this.

14

view; forget what the -- maybe I'm confused about the

15

facts or maybe I'm not.

16

plan and it is confirmed.

17

place a month earlier where a private group of creditors

18

came together, every creditor, with the debtor and they

19

worked out a sale tomorrow, and they transferred the

20

assets tomorrow.

21

includes every word of that goes before the bankruptcy

22

judge, the bankruptcy judge thoroughly understands the

23

situation, and he says:

24
25

You then concede -- let me for my own point of

But let's suppose there is a
The transfer, however, took

Four months later, the plan that

I confirm the plan.

Now, under those -- in that circumstance, I
guess you now are -- are you prepared to concede that
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Florida cannot tax?

2

MR. MAKAR:

No, Your Honor.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Of course not.

So then --

4

then the fact that there is no plan seems to me

5

irrelevant, that situation, from the present case.

6

So now let's look at this case, where there

7

is a plan and it is confirmed.

My question, going back

8

to what I thought the facts are, is this:

9

situation I've just described -- thorough investigation

Imagine the

10

later by the bankruptcy judge; plan including it is

11

confirmed.

12

you can assert your tax, but if the transfer took place

13

second, after the plan, you can't.

14

And you say if the transfer took place first

And my question, if I'm right on my

15

assumption, is I'd like you to provide a reason why any

16

human being, a reasonable human being, would want to

17

make that distinction?

18

Why would anyone want to say we want to give

19

all the money to the creditors and not let Florida get

20

some if it takes place, the transfer, after the

21

confirmation, but would think differently about it and

22

would want Florida to get some if the transfer takes

23

place before the confirmation, which confirmation

24

describes everything in depth, is thoroughly

25

investigated, et cetera?

What reason could there be for
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

such a distinction?

2

MR. MAKAR:

Well, two things,

3

Justice Breyer.

4

in terms of a -- 1146(c) speaks in terms of a "plan

5

confirmed."

6

First of all, the Bankruptcy Code speak

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not speaking of the

7

language for the moment.

I want you to forget about the

8

language and assume the language is ambiguous.

9

different question.

That's a

My question is, assuming that the

10

language is ambiguous, as every lower court has found,

11

assuming that, however, is there any reason why a

12

reasonable human being would make this distinction?

13

That's my question.

14

want to know what answer is.

And there may be an answer, but I

15

MR. MAKAR:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

Sure.

MR. MAKAR:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

(Laughter.)

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

I mean, you could say this

was Congress, right?

18

22

In this context --

I'm sorry?
That is not an answer.

I would appreciate an

answer to the question.
MR. MAKAR:

Well, Justice Breyer, I think

24

the practical reason is Congress has created a

25

structured Bankruptcy Code, in which there is a plan
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

confirmation process structure that Congress has

2

provided here.

3

perhaps the hypothetical, this was done outside the plan

4

confirmation process.

5

done even before a plan was even filed.

6

And in this particular case, and in

In other words, this sale was

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose one of the

7

reasons would be how far do you go back?

8

back three years and say, well, you know, the bankruptcy

9

judge can say, part of what I'm confirming is the sale

10

that took place three years ago, so you can file for a

11

refund, I guess.

12
13
14

MR. MAKAR:

I mean, you go

Well, that's the fundamental

problem we have.
JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the problem?

If

15

that's the problem, I thought that there had to be a

16

filing for bankruptcy before any of this kicks in.

17
18
19

MR. MAKAR:

Well, there certainly is.

There

has to be a filing for -JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Then the answer

20

can't be you could go back 50 years.

21

have to be you go back until the filing for bankruptcy.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The answer would

Well, why does there

23

have to be -- there has to be a filing for bankruptcy

24

before you get a plan confirmed, but I didn't understand

25

that to be the threshold before -- what does that mean,
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there has to be a filing for bankruptcy?

That the

2

confirmation of the plan can't go back before that?

3

MR. MAKAR:

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

then in a lot of cases to look for preferential

6

transfers and things like that.

7

MR. MAKAR:

Well -It goes back before

Well, sure, but here what we

8

have is the language of the statute, 1146(c), is keyed

9

in to a key event, which is plan confirmation, the plan

10

confirmed.

The authority for the bankruptcy judge to

11

grant the tax --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought your

13

answer to Justice Breyer was saying there's another key

14

event and that's the filing of the petition for

15

bankruptcy.

16

MR. MAKAR:

Well, that has -- I don't see

17

that as having any relevance as to the authority of the

18

bankruptcy judge to grant the tax exemption.

19

question I understood was how far back can can you go?

20

And our position on that is opening this up to

21

pre-confirmation transfers creates all sorts of

22

problems.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

What?

The

That's what I want

24

to know.

And I'll add a qualification.

25

read into this a context, and the context is the whole
9
Alderson Reporting Company

I'd say I would

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

section that gives the exemption from the State law only

2

kicks in when you file for bankruptcy.

3

So, I -- now, it's my question.

I guess I

4

could make the hypothetical the the way I want to make

5

it, and the way I want to make it is that this section

6

applies once it kicks in, the bankruptcy filing, and it

7

does not distinguish between the pre- and the

8

post-confirmation, you know, where the confirmation

9

takes place after the transfer or the transfer after the

10

confirmation.

11

You're arguing to the contrary.

12

want to know is what reason there is?

13

repeat the question?

14

MR. MAKAR:

No.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do I have to

No.
What is the reason?

16

what I want you to focus on, for making that

17

distinction.

18

MR. MAKAR:

And what I

That's

Well, as I understand the

19

question, Justice Breyer, you're concerned about the

20

pre-confirmation transfer that ultimately gets wrapped

21

into a plan that's ultimately confirmed and why

22

shouldn't that be occurring?

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Our position -That's what the whole case

is about.
MR. MAKAR:

Right.

And that's the language

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the statute in our view provides that the authority

2

flows from the confirmed plan.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He wants a reason why that

4

might be.

Do you know many instances in which Congress

5

has set up a system in which you cannot determine

6

whether a State tax is valid or invalid until some

7

future event at an indeterminate time which may be three

8

years later?

9

Is that customary -MR. MAKAR:

No, in fact --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

-- for someone not to know

11

whether the tax is payable or not for sure until three

12

years later?

13

MR. MAKAR:

No, that's exactly our argument.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. MAKAR:

Isn't that a good reason?

That's our argument, which is

16

that it is -- is not narrowly construing the statute.

17

It's broadly construing it, as the Eleventh Circuit

18

found --

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's another

20

assumption then that was in Justice Breyer's question

21

about, well, you have to have the petition, the

22

bankruptcy petition.

23

sale -- wasn't the basic arrangement made the day before

24

the petition was filed?

25

But in this very case wasn't the

MR. MAKAR:

Right.

This appears to be one

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of those so-called pre-packaged plans where it was

2

arranged and was sort of put together outside a formal

3

plan confirmation process.

4

typically there's the filing of the petition --

Under the Bankruptcy Code,

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

6

MR. MAKAR:

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Absolutely.

-- and filing of the plan -You were asked, and I

8

think tried to answer and never got your answer out, and

9

I'd like to hear:

What is it you were saying about

10

cases in which pre-confirmation transfers are made and

11

the tax exemption is made?

12

that you might never recover the tax later on?

13

kind of a problem does it create?

14

MR. MAKAR:

Did you start to tell us
Or what

That's precisely my point.

15

three-quarters of these cases approximately, these

16

exemptions can be given.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In

Yes, but then the question

18

is, can you nevertheless, in an untimely fashion,

19

eventually get the tax imposed and the tax collected?
MR. MAKAR:

20
21

possibly.

22

these cases.

23

doesn't get notice.

24
25

Possibly.

If it's in escrow,

It takes a tremendous amount of monitoring in
There's a problem with notice.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The State

Are there also instances

-- and, again, I'm interested in Justice Breyer's
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question and Justice Stevens's question, the practical

2

reasons that might have prompted the statute to be drawn

3

in the way that you say it's been drawn.

4

instances where a transaction goes through and is later

5

unwound, is later set aside?

6

refunded?

7

MR. MAKAR:

Yes.

Are there also

So that the tax has to be

I mean, that could be a

8

possibility.

That's our position, that this is sort of

9

turning this into a refund statute, perhaps in some

10

instances, by allowing all these pre-confirmation

11

transfers to be eligible for the exemption, keeping in

12

mind that this whole question in this case is:

13

preconfirmation transfers ever eligible?

14

they -- that they are because, as the courts in NVR and

15

Hechinger said, the natural, simple, bright-line test is

16

if you get to plan confirmation, if you've gone through

17

the process that Congress has established, and you get a

18

plan confirmed, then the transfer of the security --

19

this is not a securities case -- but the transfer of the

20

property has at that point been exempt from the tax.

21

Are

We don't think

So in our view, the purpose of the statute

22

would be thwarted by allowing all these pre-confirmation

23

exemptions.

24

perhaps you will get the plan confirmed, and perhaps --

25

As I say, in 25 percent of the cases

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

position.

4

wait or have to wait until after confirmation of the

5

plan, because the tax liability is going to save them a

I assume that if you're right, people who

Is it going to work in that case?

7

MR. MAKAR:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Work in the sense that -I mean, will the

effect of your plan be that it will discourage people
who come along and want to buy a bankrupt business?

MR. MAKAR:

No.

I think we have to put this

12

in context.

13

reorganization.

14

liquidation, which is typically where the assets of the

15

company would be liquidated and sold off, and you have a

16

trustee.

17

reorganization -- Congress established this

18

reorganization process.

19

What we have is a Chapter 11
And then Chapter 7 of course is

Here we have a different context.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This

But are you not -- are

20

you questioning -- what I understand to be the case,

21

it's not at all uncommon for a Chapter 11 these days to

22

have the 363(b) sale of property, then have some kind of

23

global settlement, and then distribute all the assets,

24

never have any kind of reorganization.

25

understand that it was necessary to kick the case over
14
Alderson Reporting Company

And I didn't

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

into Chapter 7.

2
3

Aren't there many cases filed under Chapter
11 that end up with no reorganization?

4

MR. MAKAR:

There are a number.

There are a

5

number.

6

small but growing percentage in which the debtors are

7

taking advantage of Chapter 11 to liquidate rather than

8

go through Chapter 7.

9

may be that the debtor in possession of the company has

10
11

And I'm not sure exactly the number, but it's a

And there's reasons for that.

It

greater control than a trustee would and so forth.
Our point is that this is -- in this

12

liquidation context, it's basically trying to hammer a

13

Chapter 7 peg into a Chapter 11 hole, because what is

14

happening here is the tax exemption that Congress has

15

set up here, which should be narrowly construed in favor

16

of the State, is being broadly expanded.

17

the Eleventh Circuit did below --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In fact, what

What harm is done?

19

you tell us in just a few words, what's the harm?

20

That's what Justice Breyer's concerned about.

21

MR. MAKAR:

Could

Well, the harm, Justice Scalia,

22

is that in these instances -- as I said, in cases where

23

he exemption is being granted unjustifiably, the State

24

has to expend resources on litigation.

25

a new test, and there has -- it is going back to court,
15
Alderson Reporting Company

And there is now

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and there is --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

And it's not the

3

litigation.

4

have taken it in, that the practical harm is the

5

following:

6

that take place after the filing, but before the actual

7

confirmation; and in respect to those transfers, the

8

State is left in a position of uncertainty.

9

What you've said so far is, at least as I

There will be a certain number of transfers

You don't know if you can assert your tax or

10

not assert your tax until that transfer is later

11

confirmed as part of the confirmed plan or not.

12

That's what I take it as you're having said.

13

And then I think I'll hear in a minute somebody say, but

14

that kind of uncertainty is rife in the tax laws.

15

often occurs that a taxing authority is not certain

16

about how to characterize a transaction until later

17

events take place which are part of, or related to, the

18

transaction; and the IRS and all the State tax

19

departments survive.

It

20

So if I'm right in guessing that, discuss.

21

(Laughter.)

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. MAKAR:

That's all I can say.

The notice provision is one.

24

The State may not get notice.

For example in NVR,

25

there's 5,000-and-something transfers of property that
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

happened in the State of Florida that we never get

2

notice of to object to them.

3

we probably don't get notice because we don't own the

4

property that is being transferred.

5

If it is in a 363 context,

All this pre-confirmation effort and

6

expenditure of resources on -- the State has to monitor

7

these --

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What about the solvency of

the person who has tentatively been declared exempt from

10

your tax; so, therefore, you can't go get him right

11

away?

12

somebody who is on the edge of bankruptcy.

13

normally want to get your money out of him as soon as

14

possible before he squanders what is left, right?

This is not the ordinary citizen.

15

MR. MAKAR:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This is
You would

Well, I -And would it -- would it

17

not happen with some frequency that, even though you

18

could have collected the tax three years earlier, by the

19

time it turns out for sure that there's never going to

be a Chapter 11 confirmation --

MR. MAKAR:

Under -- under Florida law it is

2

imposed upon the transaction and is repaid by the buyer

3

or the seller.

4

But on the question here --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What I don't understand

5

about the -- how the Florida system works, I thought you

6

don't get -- you don't get the transfer recorded until

7

you pay the tax.

8
9

I thought that's what Florida law was.

MR. MAKAR:

That's correct.

But here what

is happening is with the pre-confirmation orders that

10

are coming out with regularity, those are being used to

11

prevent the taxes from being paid and the recordation

12

of --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why can't you just say

14

that?

Why can't you say, you want to record this

doesn't even know about it, and sometimes --

powerful, which is that the language of the statute,

13

itself, put in the context of this Chapter 11

Well, and that's what happens in

17

some of these cases that are transferred to Chapter 7 or

dismissed, where they get the tax exemption and then get

19

out of the Chapter 11 whirl, having gotten the tax

exemption, leaving the State to have to unravel what has

21

been done.

22

That's the beauty and simplicity of the

23

bright-line rule of Hechinger and NVR, which is that the

language of the statute says post -- it says confirmed

So it is at that point that the authority of the

exists and, thereby, makes it self-executing in the

What I'm -- where I think there may be some

confusion is simply that in these three-quarters of the

The way in which most debtors generate the

cash necessary to get to confirmation, to pay all of the

things that have to be paid in cash on confirmation is

In fact, this tax exemption is more

11

important for pre-confirmation transfers to the

confirmation process than post-confirmation transfers.

Here in this case, if you look at the joint

answer to that question is that the creditors have

diverse interests.

Secure creditors often want to

after confirmation as long as you have a confirmed plan.

22

It must mean something else.

And we

Now, it's also critical that where Congress

23

intended to foreclose the debate to require that there

24

be a plan first, such as in section 1142(b) or section

25

511(b), Congress said "under a confirmed plan."

cannot insert a verb between confirmed and plan, where

it's confirmed plan.

In this section, Congress -- in 1146(a),

that mean plan that has been confirmed, plan that may be

It's ambiguous.

Does

It's ambiguous.

Again, in section 1142(b), Congress
expressly dealt with transfers under a plan -- under a

confirmed plan.

means there was a plan first, and then it authorizes

parties under the plan to make the transfers that are

authorized under the confirmed plan.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is it relevant, as your

No, Justice Souter.

normal reading, if we're going to give any weight to the

placement in the statute at all -- and I think we're

entitled to give some, that unless there is the kind of

9

clarity that you've just been describing in these two

exceptions, that, in fact, the placement there indicates

11

that it is dealing with a post-confirmation matter?

12

MR. BRUNSTAD:

I think it is entitled to

There is a test which the lawyers and the

courts apply as to whether we should stay in Chapter 11

12

when the situation has been that most of the assets have

been sold or whether we should convert to Chapter 7, and

14

that is whether it's in the best interests of the

creditors and the best interests of the estate to stay

That test was met here.

here's the language that is the same -- "under a plan

Section 365(g) deals with

And there are two
"If such contract

So, if the contract or lease has not been
assumed or -- under this section, section 365, or under

10

a plan confirmed under Chapter 11, then the breach is

11

basically deemed to have existed just immediately prior

12

to the filing of the bankruptcy case.

13
14

It is exactly the same language.

And it is

also in (g)(2), the same language is used yet again.
It cannot be the case that the election to

19

must occur prior to confirmation, up until the point of

confirmation, is the language this Court used.

21

22

exactly the same thing.

23

for that.

24
25

It cannot.

Why?

Because, as this

The

And there's an important reason

The standard for assumption or rejection,
even if it is elected in a plan, is you have to satisfy

section 365.

And that has to be done through a court

order, through a court proceeding that has to occur

essentially before the court actually confirms the plan.

4

So the same language used --

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Why?

Why?

Because the debtor has to

7

elect -- the debtor has to make a decision before

8

confirmation so we know what's going to happen to the

9

property, and so the creditor can timely final a claim

10

if it is going to be rejection, because the creditor

11

does not file a claim for rejection damages for

12

rejection of the contract until the assumption or

13

rejection is determined.

14

postponed.

That particular thing is

But we must know that prior to confirmation

15
16

because we have to know how to treat the creditor's

17

claim; if we have to pay that creditor significant

18

money, what's going to happen to the property.

19

example, Justice Souter, suppose it is a contract to

20

purchase a Boeing 767 for $600 million.

21

might file for bankruptcy, one of the airlines files for

22

bankruptcy and might have to decide whether to honor

that obligation or to reject that obligation, assume it

or reject.

to know if the debtor is going to have to pay that $600

4

We can't wait until after
It's too

That's why all the courts, including this

5

one, have said you must make the assumption-or-rejection

6

election up until confirmation, never after.

7

can't be the case that the specific language "under a

9

refers to post-confirmation, but that is in fact the

same language used in section 1146.

11

Now, contrast that with the language used in

different than "under a confirmed plan"?

think you can -- you can actually see in context why

that so clearly means -- that so clearly means the plan

different language that is used.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But again, it's

Do you -- do you

5

agree with the proposition that you only go back so far

6

as the filing of the petition?

7

argument suggests that that's a logical stopping point?

8

It seems to me that if you don't take the date of

9

confirmation, I don't know why all of your policy

10
11

Well, what in your

arguments wouldn't cause you to go back further.
MR. BRUNSTAD:

By statute, Chief Justice

12

Roberts, section 103 provides that the provisions of

13

Chapter 11, in Chapter 11, including section 1146, apply

14

only in a Chapter 11 case.

15

There is no case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, but we've

16

already shown a willingness to abandon that type of

17

limitation with "under a plan confirmed."

18

the consideration of the prior transfer is going to take

19

place in the context of a bankruptcy case.

20

MR. BRUNSTAD:

So, you know,

The only sections that apply

21

basically to pre-bankruptcy, pre-petition matters, are

22

the avoidance powers in section, for example, the

23

preference actions in section 547, the fraudulent

expressly apply to pre-bankruptcy events, and they say,

Those things

before the -- "90 days before the commencement of the

reach back before the petition date, it used very

4

specific terms of the art, very specific authorization.

5

When Congress wanted to

Nothing like that appears anywhere in

6

section 1146(a), and for good reason.

It's very clear,

7

and every court to have looked at this has so held, that

8

1146(a) does not apply before the case is commenced.

9

And that makes sense because the purpose is to give tax

10

relief to facilitate the Chapter 11 process.

11

to have cash available --

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You want

Let me just ask this.

As

13

a practical matter does the judge, the bankruptcy judge,

14

enter some kind of an order approving the transfer, even

15

though it's pre-confirmation, an order to establish the

16

tax exemption?

17

MR. BRUNSTAD:

18

fact, that has to happen.

19
20

Yes, Justice Stevens.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So it would have to be

after the filing of the bankruptcy proceeding.

MR. BRUNSTAD:

12

There isn't the opportunity for the State to come in and

13

actually object to things as there is pre-confirmation.

14
15

So here the State actually has more
protections for the pre-confirmation sale --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How do you know

17

whether to pay the tax or not?

I mean, you know that

18

the bankruptcy petition has been filed, but you really

don't know whether there's going to be a plan confirmed

happens then is the State can come in and has the right

to file a request for payment of administrative expense

ends up not being a confirmed Chapter 11 plan, then the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Is that a uniform practice?
That is the practice, but

4

it's not uniform because in some cases there's no need

for an escrow.

there's going to be enough cash available that the State

will be paid, so we don't need that safety.

in the sense that Congress was clearly intending here to

MR. BRUNSTAD:

That's the limitation that

13

the United States wanted to add to section 267 of the

14

Bankruptcy Act of 1898.

Congress did not grant the

15

United States' request.

The United States said this is

administratively too difficult to administer, and

Congress rejected that testimony from the representative

of the Treasury and enacted section 267 over the

objection of the United States.

3

MR. BRUNSTAD:

That may, Justice Ginsburg,

4

have been a mirror provision.

Before 1938, the

5

tax-exemption provisions under the Bankruptcy Code were

6

mirrored.

7

in section 77(b)(F).

8

provisions under the bankruptcy -- under the Internal

Revenue Code.

There was a provision in the Bankruptcy Act
There were also mirroring

Those were eliminated and instead we just

10

have section 267 under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, which

11

dealt with the exemption in bankruptcy.

12

Justice Ginsburg, I think that, going back

13

to your earlier point, I think it's important to

14

underscore that the context of this case is different

15

from other contexts in which the discussion of how we

16

should construe a tax exemption applies.

17

Court here should apply the analysis that it applied in

18

Dolan, where the Court was considering application of a

19

similar canon of narrow construction, and the Court

20

said:

21

in juxtaposition to this concept that we construe

22

waivers of sovereign immunity narrowly, we don't apply

23

that because that would basically run afoul of the

24

purpose of the Federal Tort Claims Act provisions.

25

I think the

Well, in construing the Federal Tort Claims Act,

The same thing here.

The proper rule of

52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

resolution where we have an ambiguous statute is to look

2

to the purpose of the statute, and the purpose here is

3

to make Chapter 11 easier by granting tax relief.

think that, consistent with that purpose, the Court

5

should construe section 1146(a) --

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Well, that -- that's true in

17

general, Justice Scalia, but if Congress had really

18

wanted to narrow the purpose here to post-confirmation,

19

it would have surely used the temporal limitations it

20

used, for example in section 1127, where the Court said

21

before -- the Congress said before confirmation you do

22

this; after confirmation you do that.

23

is a standard legislative technique used throughout the

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is a -- that

confirmed" seems under normal interpretation of language

2

to me to mean under a plan that has been confirmed.

3

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Well, I think, Your Honor, as

4

the Court stated in Ardestani, quote, "The word 'under'

5

has many dictionary definitions, and we must draw its

6

meaning from its context," close quote.

7

Robinson, the Court looked to, where there was an

8

ambiguous statute, the purpose as the way to resolve the

9

ambiguity, and I submit that should happen here.

10

Thank you very much.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

Mr. Brunstad.

13

Mr. Makar, you have five minutes remaining,

16

your friend has made.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT D. MAKAR

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20

MR. MAKAR:

Sure, I'm be glad to, Mr. Chief

Justice.

21

365(g) here speaks in terms of a rejection

22

of an executory contract --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. MAKAR:

I'm sorry; it'

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's on page 38, the last

line, the next to the last line.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not the full, not the full

section, though.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

The red brief.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Just little snippets of it.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

10

MR. MAKAR:

This provision 365(g) says the

11

rejection of an executory contract constitutes a breach

12

of such contractual relief if the contractual relief is

13

not under a section under a plan.

14

that it's deemed rejected if, at the time of plan

22

Doesn't the rejection have to take place prior to the

plan being confirmed?

MR. MAKAR:

It says the rejection --

Does it or doesn't it?

Prior to in your opinion or not prior to?

2

MR. MAKAR:

Rejection may occur before that,

3

but the -- is referring to -- rejection in an executory

4

contract constitutes a breech, the -- when it is a

5

breach.

6

breach --

And it's only determined -- determined to be a

Now if that breach doesn't occur until the

10
11

plan is confirmed, how does the trust -- how does

12

bankruptcy judge know how to treat Boeing as a creditor?

13

MR. MAKAR:

Well, at the point of -- the

14

statute speaks in terms of the point of plan

15

confirmation.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

I understand that.

But I'm

17

sorry -- doesn't the plan which its confirmed have a

18

list of the creditors and how they are treated?

19

MR. MAKAR:

Sure.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

How do we write

21

the plan if, in fact, no breach has occurred and he

22

hasn't become a creditor until the plan is, in fact,

23

confirmed?

25

MR. MAKAR:

Well, I'm not sure I am

But I think the language of the statute here
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

is in a different context, which is saying that the

2

rejection is -- constitutes a breach but gas not been

3

assumed, and at that point it has not been assumed, but

4

at the point of confirmation --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I can understand -- just

6

taking a quick look at 365(g), why it serves a different

7

purpose and a different function.

8
9
10

But the Respondent's point was, you have to
interpret "under" differently under your view, under
365, than under the statute at issue.

11

Do you agree with that?

12

MR. MAKAR:

No.

No.

Because under a plan

13

confirmed in 365(g) relates to point of confirmation or

14

beyond, and we believe under 1146(c) or under 1146(a,

15

Congress has readopted it.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So your argument is

17

that you don't have a rejection of the executory conduct

18

-- contract --

19

what Congress --

20

until the plan is confirmed?

MR. MAKAR:

That's

That's what -- I'm sorry yes.

21

That's -- at that point.

22

argument that under a plan confirmed, 1146(c) means at

23

the point of confirmation or beyond.

24
25

That doesn't undermine the
