Mr. Katyal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KATYAL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. KATYAL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

The Ninth Circuit held that no

12

discrimination against a public employee is prohibited

13

by the Equal Protection Clause unless the targeted

14

person is a member of the suspect class or exercises a

15

fundamental right.

16

no matter how unrelated to any legitimate government

17

interest, the clause provides zero protection.

This

18

theory is contrary to the Constitution's text.

It is

19

inconsistent with this Court's precedents.

20

unworkable and is unnecessary.

21

No matter how outrageous or evil and

It is

The Ninth Circuit ignored the Equal

22

Protection Clause's guarantee to any person that the

23

State will not use its vast powers to discriminate

24

without a legitimate government purpose and particularly

25

not in ways that lead to inefficient government.
3
Alderson Reporting Company

This Court has articulated three principles

2

that control this case.

3

protects the individual from irrational discrimination.

4

Second, the Fourteenth Amendment applies to public

5

employers and rational-basis review applies to public

6

employment.

7

administrative actions of State officials, not just

8

legislatures.

9

First, the Constitution

And third, the clause applies to the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Rational-basis review

normally doesn't inquire into the actual motive, for

11

example, of the State legislators who impose such a tax

12

or impose such a restriction.

13

there have been a rational basis for this?

14

willing to abide by that test?

15

MR. KATYAL:

We simply ask:

Could

Now, are you

We are, Your Honor.

The Ninth

16

Circuit below said no rational-basis test ever; and,

17

indeed, the trial in this case allowed the government to

18

articulate any rationale, conceivable or not.

19

think, even though it doesn't make --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We do

Listen to what I'm saying.

21

Not whether you could decide that, given all of the

22

facts of this case, the criticism of the co- workers and

23

all of that, whether it is conceivable to say that this

24

was done on a rational basis.

25

rational-basis test.

That isn't the

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

It's just sitting back without these factual

2

inquiries, just as we don't inquire factually into why

3

the State legislature acted, just asking:

4

have been a rational basis for the dismissal of this

5

employee?

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Could there

Your Honor, we do agree that

7

that last part, Justice Scalia, looking at could there

8

have been a rational basis, is the proper test.

9

that is a factual determination at some level that, as

But

10

this Court in Kimel and a variety of other cases has

11

said, that you still have to look to the underlying

12

facts.

13

at page 5 of their brief when they say you have to look

14

to whether -- that whatever that rationale is, it is

15

supported by the record.

16

opportunity to --

17

And even the Solicitor General doesn't disagree

The government had the

in this case -- I mean the person is fired and that's

23

And so you go back and see:

Well, is

So you look at the time

Oh, here are a few days where she punched in
That's a possible reason, and that's enough?
MR. KATYAL:

Well, we do think that that can

24

be enough; and, indeed, that's what the government had

25

their opportunity to argue in this case.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

The Ninth

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Circuit, of course, cuts off even that very deferential

2

inquiry altogether.

3

Now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So in that case --

4

and then let's say you're at trial, and you ask:

5

you fire this person because she punched in late a few

6

times?

7

irrelevant, and that would be sustained.

I take it hat the objection would be that that's

8
9

MR. KATYAL:

Well, if it is a counter-

factual -- I mean, the plaintiff would have the

10

opportunity to negate the facts on whatever that

11

rationale.

12
13

Did

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no.

The record

shows she was -- a few times she punched in late.

14

MR. KATYAL:

And if it has anything to do

15

with government efficiency, the rational-basis test is

16

that deferential to permit that to go forward.

JUSTICE BREYER:
him?

What about he didn't like

I'm the supervisor; I didn't like him.

19

MR. KATYAL:

Even that, Justice Breyer, is

20

enough so long as it's related to government efficiency.

21

That is --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, you say

23

related.

If the truth is I don't like this person,

24

good-bye, now, is that rational?

25

mean, you know as much about the case now as I do --

When you say -- I

Alderson Reporting Company

2

that rational or not?

3
4

MR. KATYAL:

Is

That, by itself, is not because

the government has --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now that seems

6

to me to be the problem, that either -- going back to

7

Justice Scalia's point, you're either going to say

8

rational in these circumstances, which means you go into

9

it whether the time sheet was this or whether it was

10

that or the other; or you say, hey, it's always rational

11

because he could have fired him because he doesn't like

12

the person.

13

step there.

14

That's -- and I don't see some intermediate

To put the question differently, every

15

government has a, State and Federal, has an

16

administrative procedures act.

17

unreasonable, arbitrary action.

18

that if the Constitution does it by itself?

19

MR. KATYAL:

Okay.

That forbids
But why do they need

Let me say two things

20

because there are two different questions there.

21

has to do with the State laws, and so on.

22

Court has never said that the existence of other State

23

remedies somehow displaces the Equal Protection Clause

24

or other constitutional guarantees.

And this

level?

2

alleged here come right into Court to bring a Bivens

3

action and says, I was discriminated against and

4

similarly situated people were not, and it was

5

irrational?

6

such a complaint?

7

Could a Federal employee who says just what was

Could a Federal employee come to court with

MR. KATYAL:

The answer is no, Justice

8

Ginsburg, and the reason is at footnote 18 of our brief,

9

and I believe the Solicitor General doesn't disagree in

10

large amount.

11

will the court imply a right of action, as opposed to

12

the issue in this case, which is Section 1983.

13

a statutory right of action already in existence.

14

That is that for Bivens the question is,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There is

And it doesn't matter

15

that the State has civil service remedies that were not

16

used --

17

MR. KATYAL:

Not --

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- or there were union

19

grievance procedures that aren't used?

20

into Federal court and say, I don't have to use those

21

State remedies?

22

MR. KATYAL:

You can go right

That is correct.

It doesn't --

23

the existence of those State remedies does not displace

24

by itself without a statutory -- without Congress coming

25

in and mandating exhaustion or something like that.
8
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in the absence of that, this Court has not said, outside

2

of the limited area of procedural due process, that the

3

existence of either collective-bargaining agreements or

4

State laws somehow displaces a Federal constitutional

5

guarantee.

6

Now, if I could return to the first part of

7

Justice Breyer's question, which was the dividing line

8

in whether there is a clear standard, let me articulate

9

this as one.

We believe that when a government employer

10

comes in and asserts some sort of objective reality, you

11

know, so for here they said the wheat prices are

12

declining, the plaintiff should have a chance to negate

13

that and say, well, it turned out that actually the

14

wheat prices weren't declining, and so on.

15

If, however, the plaintiff -- the government

16

articulates the rationale that you had put forth before,

17

I don't like you, and somehow the supervisor says it's

18

interfering with my government efficiency and I can't do

19

the job, well, that's something that the employer will

20

never really be able to -- the employee will never be

21

able to negate.

22

brief at page 16.

23

And that is set forth in our reply

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I guess you begin

24

with the proposition that the government must always

25

have a reason for what it does?
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

MR. KATYAL:

The government must always have

a reason when it discriminates against individuals.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, discrimination, when

4

you say "discrimination," I take it you're meaning

5

discrimination not confined to the discrete categories

6

of racial, age, et cetera.

7

discrimination for any purpose.

8

You're talking about

And therefore, it seems to me that when you

9

say the government cannot discriminate, I think, in

10

effect, you're saying a government supervisor cannot

11

fire somebody simply because he does not like that

12

person, because that's a discrimination in relation to

13

the people that the supervisor does like; is that

14

correct.

15

MR. KATYAL:

That is -- that is correct as

16

long as -- as long as, Justice Souter, it is not related

17

to government efficiency; that is, if it's like this

18

case, in which --

19
20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.

It's not government

efficiency; I just don't want to be around this person.

21

MR. KATYAL:

Exactly.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then it is the case, then,

23

that if you prevail in this case, that the notion of

24

paradigmatic, at-will employment within the government

25

in any State that recognizes that now, that will, in
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fact, be eliminated to -- to the degree that there is a

2

-- a class-of-one cause of action.

3

MR. KATYAL:

To the contrary, Justice

4

Souter.

5

not happened and there is not a disagreement --

6

I don't think that will happen and indeed has

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I thought you just agreed

7

that it would happen in the hypothetical because as I --

8

and maybe I do not understand at-will employment, but I

9

thought the concept of at-will employment was that the

10

individual could be fired for a good reason, a bad

11

reason or no reason at all.

12

we get Justice Breyer's hypothetical:

13

And you're saying that won't pass muster, but it would

14

pass muster under an at-will employment rule.

15

MR. KATYAL:

Somewhere in that trinity
I don't like him.

Justice Souter, as a practical

16

matter it won't matter -- as a practical matter it won't

17

make a difference.

18

employee can articulate, I don't like you, and it's

19

undermining government efficiency, in most cases -- and

20

particularly in at-will cases, where there isn't a

21

collective bargaining agreement or a State law that will

22

constrain the ability of the employer to even articulate

23

some sort of efficiency --

24
25

And the reason is because an

Well, except that the cause

that the equal protection mandates, the Equal Protection

16

clauses guarantee, is to deferential that as Justice

17

Breyer said, virtually any rationale will suffice if it

18

is --

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you're getting back to

20

the point the government must always have a reason for

21

what it does.

22
23
24
25

Can you cite me a case that says that?

MR. KATYAL:

That the government must always

have a reason?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Must always have a reason

for the actions it takes.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I read this Court's

2

decision in Olech as basically mandating that as well

3

as -- you know, as well as its long history on a

4

class-of-one starting with Sioux City and Sunday Lake

5

and Snowden versus --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, those are all tax

7

cases, or in Olech, 30 feet as opposed to 15 feet, where

8

there was a clear difference that was not -- but there

9

was also an allegation of an invidious motive.

10

MR. KATYAL:

And here, of course, the jury

11

found that invidious motive.

So even if we were to --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's just hard for me to

13

get that sweeping provision out of Olech.

14

MR. KATYAL:

If the Court were worried about

15

at-will employment, it has available to it the

16

possibility of requiring animus just as Justice Kennedy

17

-- or possibly in some --

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

What happens in this

19

situation?

The government gives a reason for whatever

20

the adverse action is.

21

let's say a person had lower performance ratings than

22

another person who was retained or given promotion.

23

Your position is the employee can always contest that

24

and say that's not the real reason; that's not factually

25

supported; is that correct?

Somebody -- they give -- and

MR. KATYAL:

If -- if the government

articulates a rationale that is objectively based,

come back and try and rebut.

5

the extremely deferential rational basis test, which is

6

why so few causes get through.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

It now it does so under

And indeed --

How is it extremely

8

deferential when the employee is going to say that's not

the real reason; the real reason was simply spite and

10

animus and personal dislike?

12

MR. KATYAL:
put forth --

15

Because if the government can

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that goes before the

jury.
MR. KATYAL:

Yeah, I don't believe it goes

16

to the jury, Justice Alito, because under this Court's

17

decision in Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, summary judgment

18

stage will incorporate whatever the rationale basis test

19

or review is.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

The employee says -- look,

21

it seems to me, the employee says in an affidavit the

22

supervisor doesn't like me, and here are the 20 things

23

that the supervisor has done and said over the course of

24

the last five years to indicate personal dislike.

-- then it goes to the jury.

Then

MR. KATYAL:

Again as long as the employer

2

can articulate a reason based on government efficiency,

3

there is no way for that employee to rebut that.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you're going to

5

have to articulate it in Federal court.

6

it's a deferential standard, it's not -- but every case

7

now -- every case of an employee firing, in fact every

8

case of employee not getting as big a raise as he

9

thought he was entitled, that's now a Federal case.

10

MR. KATYAL:

You emphasize

Well, there are two problems

11

with that.

12

under existing laws, Title VII, the panoply of other

13

laws.

14

The first is those are already Federal cases

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But Title VII,

15

there's no --you know, there is no, "because you don't

16

like me," it's not because I'm a particular race or --

17

MR. KATYAL:

But if we're positing a

18

frequent filer plaintiff who's bent on trying to file a

19

lawsuit, they can always make a Title VII.

you're firing me because of --

with what I've just said?

MR. KATYAL:

Now what's wrong

Well, I don't think there is

anything quite wrong with that.

5

One, the existence of all of those State remedies and so

on are far more attractive for the employment plaintiff

than this cause of action.

One was the budget having to do with

the Oregon State budget, and that was ultimately

12

withdrawn by the State.

13

answer to that is yes.

It's got to be grounded in fact.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The government is saying

21

had she been dismissed for this reason, and we really

22

don't know whether that was the reason or not, but had

she been dismissed for this reason it would have been

24

rational.

MR. KATYAL:

So long as, Justice Scalia,

that rationale is itself grounded in the facts.

is, you can't come in and say she wasn't -- she was

coming to work late when she wasn't.

then --

But if she were,

your position to be that, but that -- -

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I didn't understand

The test here is -- the test

8

I'm trying to offer is one of objective -- objective --

9

whether the rationale is objectively falsifiable.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can I ask you

11

more -- perhaps a more abstract question about this

12

class-of-one?

13

Doesn't that have the effect of adding an

14

equal protection claim to every violation of law?

15

other words, you have a Fourth Amendment search and

16

seizure claim, and you're treated illegally; you say

17

well, everybody else was treated legally and I wasn't,

18

so it's an equal protection violation?

19

know, the zoning ordinance, it was improper under the

20

zoning law, and because everybody else was properly

21

treated, it's a violation of equal protection.

22

MR. KATYAL:

You get -- you

That is a problem, I think,

under this Court's decision in Olech generally.

MR. KATYAL:

I do not.

3

has had a long history on --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think this Court

I don't find anything in

5

Olech that says that every action that does not have a

6

reason is constitutionally infirm.

7

MR. KATYAL:

Let me go back, Justice

8

Kennedy, to answer your question more directly.

9

Court has held in the employment case -- in the

This

10

employment context, that the government must have a

11

rational basis.

12

and Murgia, all of which say that when an employer is

13

dismissing employees, it must act with a rational basis.

14

So this Court has already crossed that --

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It said so in Harrah v. Martin, Beazer

All of those involved a

16

group characteristic.

17

wasn't it was methadone users?

18

involved a situation like this, where she is not

19

claiming anything about being a member of any

20

identifiable class.

21

discriminated against me -- not because of sex, race or

22

anything else.

23

One involved people -- Beazer,
But none of them

She is just saying, they

They were out to get me.

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Ginsburg, I don't quite

24

think that describes the fact of Harrah v. Martin in

25

which it was a challenge to an individual termination
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

decision by the school board.

2

cases are group-based characteristics.

3

that makes a difference, and indeed we think that the

4

Solicitor General's test on this would be unworkable in

5

practice, because everyone can assert their membership

6

in some objective --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I do agree the other
We don't think

No, but you could -- you

8

could take sentiment -- I thought you could break the

9

cases, for the most part, into two parts; one, what

10

Justice Ginsburg said, and that's where the real reason

11

is some kind of general characteristic, of a disfavored

12

group.

13

the body that's acting is a body whose business it is to

14

classify.

15

classifying in fact, not some theoretical thing where

16

you say, oh, well, they're classifying it employment

17

because they put you in the class of such and such.

18

those two seem to me to handle the bulk of the cases,

19

which, if I'm right about that, would leave your client

20

out in the cold.

21

right.

The second is the instance where the -- where

22

That's zoning, taxation, and it means really

But

So I assume you'll tell me why I'm not

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I will try.

So the first

23

thing is that -- I don't quite think that describes the

24

facts of Harrah versus Martin, which is an individual

25

decision.

And, secondly, once you start going down the
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

line of objective, group-based characteristics and the

2

like, it is infinitely manipulable, and that's why the

3

Ninth Circuit decisions after, in the wake of this

4

decision below, are dismissing group-based claims on --

5

on disability and age and the like.

6

replead their claim as part of a group, that is, Ms. --

7

you know, Ms. Engquist can say she's part of a group of

8

two, those who complained about their supervisors and up

9

10

Everyone can

And so the problem is it becomes unworkable

11

in practice.

12

Ginsburg, doesn't say, the way the Solicitor General

13

would like it be, doesn't say no State shall deny equal

14

protection of the law to anyone who is a member of an

15

objective group-based, you know, group and class.

22

claim, it has to be some group-based animus, not malice

23

directed toward a particular individual.

24
25

It's a cause of action provided by

So that's why this is something State and

1985 also uses the word "person or class of

I don't quite think that -- I

think the Court has already dealt with that in Olech by

2

an individual person's claim.

3

4

5

Now, if we --

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so -- and so that is

Well, maybe because

7

1985(3) is in a discrimination context, The Court could

8

say 1983 -- we know the classification to which Justice

9

Breyer was referring, tax classifications, zoning

10

classifications, but this group of claims we're cutting

11

out.

I would agree with that.

I

21

think it might open a whole can of worms were the Court

22

to say that 1983 requires some group-based

23

discrimination outside of this particular context that

24

we are talking about.

25

And so I think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, it certainly opens

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a can of worms to say that you take every claim against

2

the government, every claim of wrongdoing by the

3

government, and make it an equal protection claim

4

because you say other people were treated properly and I

5

was treated improperly; therefore, I have an equal

6

protection claim.

7

MR. KATYAL:

Except, Justice Ginsburg, we've

8

had this cause of action now for 26 and 27 years in two

9

circuits; we have it in nine.

We haven't seen the

10

effect on at-will employment nor, more generally, on the

Equal Protection Clause opening up that can of worms

that you're hypothesizing.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANET A. METCALF

19
20
21
22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. METCALF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit decision in this case is

23

consistent with this Court's recognition, in other

24

constitutional contexts, that Federal court is simply

25

not the forum in which to second-guess everyday
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

decisions made by public employers.

2

consistent with this Court's recognition, again in other

3

constitutional contexts, that the rights of public

4

employees simply are not as expansive in a number of

5

ways as those of citizens generally vis-a-vis their

6

public employers.

7

It's also

We think that both of those lines of cases

8

come at least in part out of the recognition that public

9

employment decisions, indeed employment decisions

10

generally, are highly subjective in nature and highly

11

individualistic in nature.

12

We think really that the Ninth Circuit here

13

has gone no farther than to apply those concepts as a

14

specific context of class-of-one cases brought in the

15

public employment context.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Ninth Circuit

17

decision would rule out the case where an employee says:

18

I was the most qualified person for this position by

19

far, but the supervisors took a bribe from a rich uncle

20

to promote somebody else.

21

MS. METCALF:

Yes.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

MS. METCALF:

That would be out?

That would be out as an equal

protection claim.

The scapegoat case, too,

MS. METCALF:

Yes.

Yes, it would.

It would

under this rationale --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- but we have said

6

that -- that there is a constitutional claim if the

7

reason the person was not hired is that the person did

8

not belong to the political party that the -- that the

9

hiring person belonged to, the current administration.

10

MS. METCALF:

And --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You said you can't turn

12

down somebody just because she's a Democrat or a

13

Republican.

14

MS. METCALF:

That's correct.

And our

15

formulation I think, of the test, Your Honor, is that

16

there should be no such thing as a class-of-one equal

17

protection claim in the public employment context, with

18

certain exceptions, those exceptions including, for

19

example, exercising a fundamental right; membership in a

20

suspect class; perhaps certain other criteria, such as

21

the one you mentioned, certain other classifications.

22

But that as -- as a general matter, the broad question

23

that the Ninth Circuit faced, is there, outside of those

24

exceptions, is there such a thing as a class-of-one

25

public employment?

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me ask, following up

Would that cross

He had a practice of not -- you know,

MS. METCALF:

No, no, Justice Stevens, and

again to be clear --

10
11

Suppose it's not a

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If it's not a class of one

12

MS. METCALF:

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

whether there would be a cause of action?

15

MS. METCALF:

I keep throwing up -Do you say no or yes to

No.

Because -- and this is

16

why I keep using quotes for "class-of-one."

17

"Class-of-one" doesn't literally describe the number of

18

plaintiffs, both because in some cases there might be a

19

single plaintiff, but they're alleging discrimination

20

based on membership in a class.

22

footnote in Olech, Olech could have been described as a

23

class of five.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

that there is an objective reason for promoting or

retaining -- the person has a college degree and so

4

forth -- but that that person is rejected anyway because

5

of dislike.

6

MS. METCALF:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8
9

But -- but again -That's the hypothetical.

Why is that hypothetical case different than Olech?
MS. METCALF:

You might have an unusual

10

employment case in which an employer has drawn up a list

11

of objective criteria.

12

not the average case.

13

for example, prefer that someone have a degree, but --

14

That's not this case.

That's

In the average case you might,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But then we say that there

15

is a subset of unusual cases where we will allow the

16

cause of action?

17

MS. METCALF:

No.

We offer the subjective

18

nature as a general reason why simply class-of-one

19

analysis should not apply in this context, period,

20

because the average -- whereas the average in the

21

regulatory context probably is a high degree of

22

objectivity, the average in the employment context is a

23

relatively high degree of subjectivity and discretion.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

of employment where there's a lot of discretion.

arguments on the other side.

You can't be liable for

14

15

If you had a judgment call to make, you say, I

MS. METCALF:

Well -- and certainly I'm

16

somewhat perhaps surprised by Petitioner's argument

17

today because I understand Petitioner's argument to

18

almost concede the point that summary judgment should

19

have been given to the -- to the State's defendants in

20

this case because in fact, with regard to each of the

21

three employment decisions that are at issue in this

22

case, the State and the defendants did proffer and --

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But we are concerned about

24

the case -- let's just assume, just take it as a

25

hypothetical case -- where there is an arbitrary and
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

vindictive reason for hiring the employee and it has

2

nothing to do with race, sex, or other recognized

3

suspect or improper categories.

4

answer to me was, well, I might make an exception to

5

that.

6

MS. METCALF:

No.

And I thought your

My answer to you is as

7

long -- well, my answer to you is twofold.

If we're

8

simply considering whether, in fact, there could be such

9

a thing as a class-of-one case in the employment

10

context, our answer is no.

If we're past that and the

11

issue is what's the test to apply, our test is as long

12

as there is any conceivable rational basis for the

13

action that the government employer took, the case

14

should be at end; it should not go to the jury.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, isn't that an

16

odd system?

17

example, you're going to have litigation over whether

18

she was late for work or was not late for work, and in

19

fact that's got nothing to do with the reasons she was

20

fired at all.

21

this is a conceivable reason, and then the other side

22

says, no, it's not, and they fight.

23

otherworldly; it has nothing to do with the reason at

24

all.

25

I mean, you have -- like our time card

And yet the government puts it out, well,

MS. METCALF:

It just seems so

Well, the -- often the real
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reason -- and this Court has made this observation in

2

particular in legislative contexts.

3

reason is not necessarily apparent or undisputed, and

4

beyond that, that's simply the test that this Court has

5

employed as a general matter in rational-basis

6

equal-protection cases.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But often the real

Well, but that's

8

with respect to legislative or regulatory action, where

9

there are important reasons not to inquire into the

10

motives of the legislators.

11

that same rationale applies here.

MS. METCALF:

It's not clear to me that

Well, two points, Your Honor.

13

I would certainly agree that the Court has most often,

14

if not always, said that in the legislative context.

15

But Petitioner is not really arguing for a different

16

test here.

17

perhaps I misunderstand it, but Petitioner's argument is

18

that this Court should apply customary rational-basis

19

analysis and apply such analysis as long as the

20

government has some conceivable rational basis that --

21

As I understand Petitioner's argument, and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's not -- you know

22

that that's not the position they took in their brief.

23

They said it's not a hypothetical, any conceivable.

25

category, the government has to articulate a reason

hypothetical reason is not good enough.

-- we don't agree that that would be the test.

Yes.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's because of

existence of other avenues of redress.

18

MS. METCALF:

Not solely.

That, I think, is

19

a factor.

It's because of, again, this Court's

20

recognition in other contexts that public employees

21

simply are not on the same footing as private citizens

22

generally with regard to their employers, and that

23

Federal court is simply not the appropriate forum in

24

which to review the day-to-day decisionmaking of public

25

employers; and because of recognition of the inherently

subjective nature of public employment decisions.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I understood that the

Do you think he's right or wrong on

MS. METCALF:

I think so far as anyone can

determine, he's right to date.

Obviously, we have some

10

real concern that if this Court were to say that there

11

were such a cause of action, that things might change.

12

Beyond that, I think the relatively few number of cases,

13

and in particular the very, very small to-date number of

14

successful cases is an argument against extending

15

class-of-one equal protection analysis into this

16

context, because there will be an adverse effect on

17

public employer discretion if the Court were to extend

18

the analysis.

19

about what happened in this case, that their decisions

20

are subject to later second-guessing in Federal court.

21

It may well chill the exercise of public employer

22

discretion.

23

public employer discretion, it is that it's

24

underutilized not overutilized, and there would be a

25

real danger that for the price of a very few successful

Public employers would have to worry

And I think the most common complaint about

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cases you would chill the exercise of public employer

2

discretion.

3

So, we actually think that that point is an

4

argument against the extension, not for it.

5

agree that we can't point to any enormous flood of cases

6

to date.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What proportion of your

some kind of protections under your statutes?

MS. METCALF:

As a matter of fact, none of

5

the assistant attorneys general, including me, have any

6

protection.

7

of collective -- I'm arguing against myself in this case

8

-- most employees in the State of Oregon have some kind

9

of collective bargaining protection.

10

So at will is the

exception, not the rule.

11
12

Most -- most State employees have some kind

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Don't have you some kind

of civil service system, too?

13

MS. METCALF:

Not precisely.

It's much more

14

a matter of collective bargaining, but it amounts to

much the same thing in the end.

17

are employed at will are the exception rather than the

Absolutely.

And I would

readily concede that fact.
If the Court gets to the second part of the

22

case and the question becomes what sort of test,

23

assuming that the Court finds a class-of-one analysis

24

should apply in this context and the question becomes:

25

What's the test?

Really, all the State is asking for
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

here is an application of the customary, rational-basis

2

test in which if any conceivable rational basis can be

3

offered by the government, the case should be at an end.

4

That position was raised below by the State

5

defendants, who raised the point both in their summary

6

judgment motion and in their trial memo and urged the

7

district court to take this case away from the jury on

8

that basis, and the district court refused to do so.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What do you say to the

10

argument that the conceivable-basis test is appropriate

11

when we are judging legislation, because we don't know

12

what goes through the minds of individual legislators.

13

Whereas, these kinds of decisions, employment decisions,

14

are, in fact, very specific state-of-mind kind of

15

decisions; and, therefore, the equal-protection standard

16

ought to take that into consideration and look to the

17

specific reasons?

18

MS. METCALF:

I think the difference is not

19

that great.

I think, admittedly, the actual rationale

20

is harder to discern in legislative cases, in part,

21

because you have so many decisionmakers.

22

But here, for example, it is similar because

23

the decisionmakers might have had a number, and probably

24

did have a number, of elements in mind from dislike to a

25

preference for a certain kind of background.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,

6

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

7

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

8
9

MS. BLATT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

There are two types of class-of-one claims

11

that should not be recognized in the public-employment

12

context.

13

The first is a claim of residual ill will or

14

bad-motive complicitor, and the second is a simple

15

demand for a rational basis for an adverse personnel

16

decision.

17

The problem with those claims is that they

18

would constitutionalize routine employee grievances and

19

impose a for-cause requirement on public employers,

20

notwithstanding the long tradition of at-will public

21

employment.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Ma'am, the reason that we

23

didn't say that same thing in Oleck is because in the

24

taxation area or the easement area we simply don't have

25

the great number of cases and also because animus is
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

more easily established.

2

MS. BLATT:

It is similar.

And in the

3

regulatory context a personality conflict is not a

4

legitimate basis for adversely treating citizens.

5

personality conflict between a supervisor and a

6

subordinate is generally, if not always, a legitimate

7

basis for adversely treating an employee.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

But a

Well, I wondered if I was

right, you know; that I thought that maybe, looking

10

back, that there is something about zoning and taxation

11

where it normally is alleged that it's rule-making

activity.

13

And that perhaps you would apply all of

14

these things you are talking about where what the --

15

even if it is employment, where what the employer is

16

doing, or anyone else is doing, is creating rules, is

17

classifying.

put me and one other fired person in the fired- person

category.

zoning and legislation.

21

And not a made-up classification like you

I don't mean that.

MS. BLATT:

I mean like taxation and

Is there anything to that?
There is some support in the

22

case law, but what I think your concurring opinion was

23

trying to do was to help local and State governments.

24

And it is one thing to say the mayor denied my building

25

permit, and I'm going to make the employee allege
47
Alderson Reporting Company

animus, and that might be difficult to do.

2

someone on the mayor's staff, it's not that difficult to

allege animus on the part of your supervisor.

Employment frictions are inherent in the

all of that, but -- so the Equal Protection Clause

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And we would

Would it meet your concern

10

if we held number one, yes, there may be a class of

11

claim in the public employment context, but any reason

12

that would be a lawful reason for discharge under the

13

at-will rule is a -- a reason that would satisfy the

14

test; and therefore it would be the real outlier that

15

would ever get to the jury?

16

MS. BLATT:

Well, in the at-will context, if

17

an employer says you're fired and gives no reason,

18

that's legitimate; but in their case at least by the

19

time a lawyer is hired and the case goes to court, the

20

State is having -- has to articulate a basis that could

21

be second-guessed.

22

apply class-of-one and write a very broad opinion saying

23

almost anything goes in the employment context, that's

24

certainly preferable than having us go to juries based

25

on pretext and bad motive, which is what happened in

for-cause requirement that's inconsistent with your due

process cases, which presuppose that the personnel

entitlement must spring from someplace other than the

Well, let me ask you this.

8

I mean, I wasn't trying a trick question but I -- let me

said anything that goes under the at-will rule goes

anything left?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So we should cite there is

3

no constitutional right to be a policeman?

4

revise that?

5

MS. BLATT:

Well, no.

We can

I mean, there are

6

lots of constitutional limits on public employment.

7

What we are talking about is where you've reduced at

8

will for a null set, and there is any claim for

9

arbitrary conduct.

I mean, we would allow under our

10

theory any claim that is not just a residual ill will or

11

bad motive states a valid equal protection case.

12

this is many, many statutory protections as well.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Thank you,

Ms. Blatt.
Mr. Katyal, you have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KATYAL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KATYAL:

The Ninth Circuit in this case,

19

Your Honor, has cut out all claims conceivable or

20

otherwise, and that is contrary to the text of the Equal

21

Protection Clause in this Court's precedent.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do you agree with me that

23

if we adopted a rule that says that anything that goes

24

for at-will employment goes for one-person-class equal

25

protection, and that that in effect would eliminate any
55

1

cause of action?

2

MR. KATYAL:

It would, Justice Souter, under

3

the formal rule; that is, no reason alone is sufficient.

4

That of course as a practical matter is not the way

5

at-will works anymore, because of the panoply of rules,

6

Title 7 and otherwise that force employers to articulate

7

rationales when they terminate at-will employees.

8

a practical matter the no-reason firing doesn't exist

9

anymore because those employees, those at-will employees

10

So as

who are going to sue are going to sue anyway.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

You keep stressing the text

12

of the Equal Protection Clause.

13

late in the day to be arguing that Equal Protection

14

Clause should be read with that kind of literalness?

15

MR. KATYAL:

No.

Don't you think it's

This Court has

16

consistently held that the text of the Equal Protection

17

Clause encompasses personal claims.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

It talks about laws, but it

19

extends to situations where what's being -- the unequal

20

treatment is not stemming from the law, but from

21

executive or administrative action.

22

MR. KATYAL:

23
24
25

Alito.

That's quite right, Justice

And in fact since 1879 this Court has said -JUSTICE ALITO:

And in the other example,

are there not situations where it's been held to apply
56

1

that might not fall within the literal language of the

2

clause?

3
4

MR. KATYAL:
sir.

5
6

I'm not sure I got that down,

JUSTICE ALITO:

You think in all other

respects it's read literally?

7

MR. KATYAL:

I'm not sure if in all other

8

respects it is, but with respect to the relevant

9

questions here -- that is, does this clause apply to

10

individual agency actions, this Court has held so in

11

1879 in Missouri versus Lewis, and has held so

12

consistently ever since.

13

So in this case the government put forth one

14

rationale which was an objective one, we -- and

15

disclaimed all the others, the subjective ones; and we

16

do think that that subjective rationales in employment

17

is different, and would almost always be a rational

18

basis.

19

ones.

20

In this case they disclaimed all those other

So here the government is using its power,

21

its raw power, surely for its own personal ends and that

22

is contrary to the whole notion of why employment should

23

be different within government efficiency.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
to their Batson analogy?
57
Alderson Reporting Company

What is your answer

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. KATYAL:

Batson I think supports exactly

2

what we are saying, which is this Court has said we

3

don't review on rational basis, actions by a prosecutor

4

that are motivated, strikes that are motivated by the

5

trial, that are -- that are for a good trial; but if the

6

rationale of the prosecutor is I don't like the disabled

7

person, or I don't like --

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
adding the class aspect.

No, but you're

If the rationale of the

10

prosecutor is, I don't like this person, under Batson

11

you don't get to bring an equal protection challenge to

12

that.

13

MR. KATYAL:

I don't quite think that this

14

Court has confronted that specific issue about whether

15

it's an individual class-of one juror case.

16

language of Batson says that we don't --

17

Court won't review on rational basis a claim when it's

18

related to the government's motivation.

19

have a fair trial, a good trial.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the

that this

They are to

I thought if you have a

21

peremptory challenge it means that you can't challenge

22

on any basis other than the group -- the groups that

23

Batson has recognized.

24

challenge a peremptory, exercise a peremptory challenge

25

if it's unrelated to the selection of an impartial jury.

You - you said you could

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Well, I thought that a peremptory, outside

2

of the class cases, is matter of the prosecutor or the

3

defense attorney don't like this juror.

4

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Ginsburg, the language

5

in Batson and J.E.B. was qualified by as saying so long

6

as it related to the task at hand; and the Seventh

7

Circuit and indeed, the D.C. Circuit last year referred

8

to that language and talked about an exemption if the

9

prosecute's motive was personal, as it is in this case.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Has there ever been a

11

challenge to the exercise of peremptory challenge on the

12

ground that the challenge was unrelated to the selection

13

of an impartial jury?

14

MR. KATYAL:

In the Seventh Circuit decision

15

the court said this would stay the cause of action.

16

This was after this Court's decision in J.E.B., yes.
