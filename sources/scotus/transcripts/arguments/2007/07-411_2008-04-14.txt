Mr. Banker.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL A. BANKER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BANKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Tribes lack inherent sovereign power over

12

nonmembers.

13

recognized two narrow exceptions based on the underlying

14

principles of protecting tribal self-government and

15

controlling internal relations.

16

exceptions applies here.

17

This court in the Montana decision

Neither of those

The question today is whether the tribal

18

court possessed adjudicatory jurisdiction to hear the

19

Longs' discrimination claim against the nonmember bank.

20

It did not.

21

relationship here of the qualifying kind.

22

adjudication is not another means of regulating

23

nonmember defendant conduct.

24
25

There was no qualifying consensual

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There was --

We've said that regulation

does include regulation by adjudication for purposes of
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- of Federal pre-emption laws.

2

would it be different for -- for Indian law.

3

MR. BANKER:

Why would it -- why

Well, I think the reason that

4

it would be different for Indian law is the way that it

5

bears on the nonmember defendants' rights.

6

you look at what Montana was based on and the underlying

7

principles, I think it is important to recognize that

8

nonmember defendants in tribal court, finding themselves

9

there to adjudicate, that is something that I think was

10

contemplated by the second exception, but not the first

11

exception.

12
13

The -- if

The reason that I think that is that in
carving out two exceptions --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, I understand, but I'm

15

just talking about the first one now.

16

-- it is not regulation, right, under the first?

17

that's -- that's the only point I'm addressing.

18

should regulation through a process of adjudication not

19

be considered regulation for purposes of our Indian law

20

where -- whereas, we have made clear in several cases

21

that it does constitute regulation for purposes of

22

Federal pre-emption under statutes that pre-empt state

23

regulation?

24
25

MR. BANKER:

You say it is not
And
Why

I think that it is different in

the tribal-law context because in articulating the -4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the first exception when the Court said:

2

nonmember conduct through other means, if the Court had

3

meant to say "adjudication," I think the court could

4

have articulated that there.

5

Regulate

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I think it's -We could have said the same

6

thing about the Congress.

7

said "regulation," and we interpreted that term to

8

include common-law adjudication.

9

MR. BANKER:

Congress just said -- just

When I look at the -- you know,

10

at the -- and compare the language in the first Montana

11

exception of regulation to the language in the

12

Constitution under the Indian Commerce Clause, I see a

13

parallel there between saying that, you know, there are

14

certain types of legislative authority that tribes may

15

exercise over nonmembers versus exercising the power of

16

the courts.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, are you saying that

18

the -- that the regulatory authority could be broader

19

than the adjudicatory authority?
MR. BANKER:

20
21

established:

22

I think that has been well

That the regulatory -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you give any example

23

of that?

I mean, I found that rather surprising your

24

brief.

25

about is tax, the imposition of a tax.

The Montana -- a clear case that Montana talks

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, if a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

jurisdiction has authority to tax, then surely it has

2

authority to sue to collect that tax.

3

of a case where a State or tribe or nation has authority

4

to regulate, to legislate, but lacks authority to

5

enforce that regulation.

6

that, I would appreciate being enlightened.

7

MR. BANKER:

So I am not aware

And if you have an example of

Well, I think that there's a

8

tension between what the Court said in the Strate case,

9

where it said, presumptively, if there is the power to

10

regulate, then there is presumptively the power to

11

adjudicate.

12

by the second footnote in the Nevada versus Hicks

13

decision, which questioned, in my mind, whether or not

14

there was any adjudicatory power at all.

15

that is the question that the Court has to determine, is

16

whether --

17

That, I believe, was called into question

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I think

What was the regulation

18

that was authorized but unenforceable in the courts?

19

don't recall -- Montana -- Hicks having said anything on

20

that subject.

21

MR. BANKER:

I

Well, there was a -- the footnote

22

number 2 in Hicks at least called into question about

23

whether or not -- you know, I think it's been made clear

24

by the Court's opinions that -- that adjudicatory

25

authority is certainly no broader than legislative
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

authority.

2

in the Hicks opinion, in my mind, is whether or not

3

adjudicatory authority exists at all in the first

4

exception.

5

The question raised by the second footnote

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what is a tribe

6

supposed to do?

Let's say there is a gas station on the

7

reservation.

8

business -- it's, you know, 1 percent of gross proceeds.

9

And at the end of the year the gas station owner says,

The tribe has a tax.

10

well, I'm just not going to pay it.

11

then?

12

MR. BANKER:

Anybody doing

What do they do

Well, I think that there is a

13

difference between situations where there is a clear

14

ability to regulate and where you would move to enforce

15

that regulation and a situation where you are

16

adjudicating, you know, separate claims under the common

17

law of the tribe.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you think there

19

would be -- there would be tribal-court jurisdiction in

20

the case I hypothesized?

21

MR. BANKER:

I don't think so.

I think the

22

nature of the first exception is a consensual

23

relationship.

24

ability to regulate in the first instance, then the

25

regulation needs to be clearly consented to.

And I think if there is going to be an

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So your case, your

2

entire case, is based on whether or not there's consent

3

to dealing with the tribe by the nonmember?

4

MR. BANKER:

Well, I think it goes further

5

than that.

6

the taxation, if there was clear consent to be taxed --

7
8

If I could -- you know, in your example of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
taxed?

Who would consent to be

I mean the tax is --

9

(Laughter.)
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

It's being imposed.

11

say, at the gas station, they don't ask you when you

12

drive up:

13

But,

Now do you consent to the tax?
MR. BANKER:

Well, but by engaging in commerce

14

on the reservation and by, you know -- and this Court

15

has addressed it in a number of taxation decisions

16

regarding Indian law, the -- there is a quid pro quo for

17

--

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's different from

19

consent.

20

like and as often as you like, and you still have to pay

21

the tax.

22

You can say I don't consent as loudly as you

MR. BANKER:

But that -- you know, in the

23

taxation context, I think that is the price of doing

24

business.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but if that kind of
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

implicit consent applies in the tax context, I don't see

2

why in theory it doesn't apply in the situation we've

3

got here.

4

MR. BANKER:

Well --

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If somebody is going to do

6

business with the tribe, with tribal members, in a way

7

that affects the tribe on the reservation, it makes just

8

as much sense to say, well, they implicitly consent not

9

to discriminate against tribal members because of their

10

Indian status.

11

MR. BANKER:

I think it is, you know, that

12

consent under the first Montana exception can't be

13

implicit.

14

I think it needs to be explicit.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I thought it was

15

implicit in the tax situation, as you responded to

16

Justice Ginsburg's question.

17

MR. BANKER:

18

specific about the taxation context.

19

think that any taxation context would carry with it

20

implicit consent.

21

Well, I think we need to be

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You know, I don't

All right.

Let me take

22

another example, the other explicit example from

23

Montana, which mentioned taxing and licensing.

24

saying that if a -- in any particular activity, say,

25

running a filling station or advertising oneself as a
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Are you

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

certified mechanic in the -- at the filling station on

2

the reservation, and the tribe says, well, we are going

3

to license mechanics to make sure they are competent.

4

Are you saying that there has got to be an explicit

5

agreement to the licensing in order for the tribe to

6

enforce its licensing restriction against somebody who

7

goes to work for that gas station?

8
9

MR. BANKER:

I mean in that situation, if the

tribe said, here is the licensing that we are going to

10

impose on you for being a mechanic, and the mechanic

11

then went to work at that gas station, knowing about

12

that licensing requirement, I mean, that is -- that is

13

the sort of actual --

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

that's implicit consent then, isn't it?

16

MR. BANKER:

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

Then, that's --

I think it comes -He doesn't sign a document

18

saying "I consent"; he just goes to work.

19

answer says, okay, that's enough to catch him on

20

licensing.

21

started doing business, that's enough to catch them on

22

taxation.

23

sufficient in effect to supply an implicit consent not

24

to discriminate?

25

And your

In Justice Ginsburg's example, if they

And if that is so, why isn't tribal dealing

MR. BANKER:

Well, I don't know that I would
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- I would disagree that -- I would say that those

2

examples of consent of the licensing of the taxation are

3

much closer to being actual consent.

4

"actual consent" that there needs to be a written

5

document that says --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You don't really mean "actual

7

consent" by "actual consent," right?

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. BANKER:

10
11

Maybe you should use a

different term, like "implicit consent," maybe.
(Laughter.)

13

MR. BANKER:

15

Well, yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

14

I'm not saying by

The -- I think that there has to

be a line drawn.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

Why draw the line

16

where you want to draw it?

17

the -- I'll put a blank, the "X" consent -- what did we

18

want -- whatever adjective we want suffices for taxation

19

and it suffices for licensing.

20

for nondiscrimination?

21

you want it drawn?

22

MR. BANKER:

We've got a line in which

Why doesn't it suffice

Why do we draw the line where

The reason where we would draw

23

the line where I want to drawn it is that, you know, the

24

discrimination claim that was made here ultimately

25

turned out to be based on tribal common law.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

It arose

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

out of this -- the dealings, the contractual dealings,

2

between the bank and a nonmember corporation.

3

important for a nonmember to know where tribal

4

jurisdiction attaches or doesn't attach.

5

possible to predict when a common law, tribal -- for an

6

outsider to determine when a tribal common-law

7

discrimination claim is going to attach as a form of

8

regulation --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is

And it is not

Oh, so one of your answers to

10

an earlier question suggests the same point that you now

11

seem to be making, although I don't -- I don't recall it

from your brief.

14

had been set forth in a tribal ordinance.

right?

17

portion of tribal common law?

18

Apparently you think that it would be

MR. BANKER:

If it had been a tribal

19

antidiscrimination statute, there would have at least

been the possibility of notice and the possibility of --

2

6

9
10

You can't have it

It either makes a difference or it doesn't

MR. BANKER:

I -- I think that it does make a

difference.

11
12

We shouldn't place any weight on the fact

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you just told me it

didn't.

13

MR. BANKER:

I think --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You just told me that even

15

if it were written down, you would still need what you

16

think is express consent.

17

MR. BANKER:

I think that that provides the

18

clearest guidance for when tribal jurisdiction attaches

19

or doesn't.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, do you recognize

21

that the bank was on notice, at least that it was a Federal

22

requirement that when you deal with individual Indians

23

or what this loan company was, it was an organization of

24

Indians -- that's what the Federal law calls it -- there

25

is a duty of fair dealing?

The Federal law requires
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that.

Isn't that so?

2

MR. BANKER:

That is so, but, you know,

3

we're not here to, you know -- the Federal courts don't

4

provide a substantive review on the merits.

5

side to the story about the merits of the

6

discrimination.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Another

But it's not -- it's not

8

uncommon that a State would adopt a Federal standard as

9

its -- as its own on a question of civil rights.

A

10

State might stay, well, we choose to construe our human

11

rights law in accord with the Federal -- Federal law?

12

MR. BANKER:

No.

That's, that's not

13

uncommon.

But I think it's important to focus on the

14

background about, out of which this discrimination claim

15

arose.

16

17

with a South Dakota corporation.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wasn't part of the

transaction the obtaining of back-up liability on the

10

part of the individual Indians who, who owned the

11

corporation?

12

Didn't they guarantee the loan?
MR. BANKER:

You have to be specific about

13

the loan guarantees and the contracts that we are

14

talking about.

15

that are at issue here, there were lending relationships

16

and loan guarantees that were made.

17

when additional loans were made, there were personal

21

No, but it does give the

like this and there was a choice of forum provision,

thought there were restrictions on whether or not tribal

of who the plaintiff is if the Long Family Land and

You know, there was -- it isn't part of the

underlying tribal court about the nature of the

discrimination claim, whether it rose under Federal law

4

or what was its underlying basis.

5

favor of it being a tribal law claim.

That was resolved in

explanation of that on an underlying basis that there is

little difference between the tribal law claim and the

9

underlying Federal discrimination law.

tribal court would have had jurisdiction of such a

19

contract claim?

22

MR. BANKER:

Do you think the

I don't think so without some

sort of consent to hearing that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that the

23

bank -- I thought that the Long Company was a plaintiff

24

in the tribal court?

25

MR. BANKER:

The Long Company was a
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

plaintiff in the tribal court.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And as I understand it,

3

the Long Company asserted, along with the individuals,

4

contract claims?

5

MR. BANKER:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

That's correct.
But the Long Company did

not make a tort claim?

8

MR. BANKER:

That's correct.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So why isn't this

10

judgment, even if you're right about the individuals in

11

the tort claim, why isn't this judgment good at least as

12

to the contract claim, which are not challenging and

13

which runs to the benefit of the Long Company which has

14

nothing to do with the tort claim that you are

15

challenging?

16

MR. BANKER:

Because of the way that the

17

case was tried.

18

at page 192 -- 191 and 192 in the joint appendix, you'll

19

see that the jury -- the tribal court jury was asked

20

interrogatories about liability:

21

contract, liability for discrimination.

22

If you look at the general verdict form

Liability for

When they got to question 6 on page 192, the

23

question was asked of the jury if you answered "yes" to

24

question four for the other liability questions, four

25

being the discrimination claim, then award damages.
20
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

so the jury awarded $750,000 of undifferentiated

2

damages.

3

for tort is not for us to now second-guess.

4

general award of damages.

5

that they could award damages for breach -- for

6

discrimination.

7

Whether it was for contract, whether it was
There was a

And the jury was instructed

So, you know, that is a feature of how the

8

case was tried.

It is a feature of the way that the

9

jury returned its verdict.

And at this point it's

10

impossible to know -- the $750,000 that was ultimately

11

awarded was far less than what the Longs were asking for

12

for breach of contract, and they didn't say they were

13

not asking for damages for discrimination in the

14

tribal -- in the tribal court.

15

So for this Court to say now that there was

16

no jurisdiction over the discrimination claim would

17

basically invalidate that underlying judgment.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Banker, you several

19

times have raised a point which seems to me to go to the

20

nature of the first exception in Montana on an issue we

21

haven't discussed yet, and I want to get clear on it.

22

You have emphasized consistently through your argument

23

the need for consent whether we call it actual,

24

explicit, some kind of consent to at least the

25

regulatory jurisdiction upon which a judicial
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

jurisdiction is premised.

And my understanding is that

2

that's not what -- I don't have Montana in front of me,

3

but my understanding is that that is not what Montana,

4

in effect said with respect to the -- to the first

5

exception.

6

it was that there may be situations in which a nonmember

7

enters into a consensual relationship with the tribe or

8

tribal members, and as a result of that consensual

9

relationship, it then would be appropriate to recognize

As I recall what the court said in Montana

10

jurisdiction, for example, to tax regulatory

11

jurisdiction.

12

My understanding is that the consent that

13

Montana was talking about was not a consent to the

14

specific jurisdiction whether it be regulatory or

15

adjudicatory, but rather consent to some kind of, or a

16

consent forming some kind of a relationship that would

17

make it appropriate for the tribe to assert regulatory

18

jurisdiction.

19

relate to jurisdiction as such.

20

correct, then your argument for consent seems to me to

21

miss the point.

22

of Montana.

23

So that the consent does not have to
Am I -- if that is

But maybe I'm missing the point of --

What is your response to that?
MR. BANKER:

Well, what Montana said, the

24

actual language of Montana said a tribe may regulate

25

through taxation, licensing or other means the
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

activities of nonmembers who enter consensual

2

relationships with the tribe or its members, through

3

commercial dealings, contracts, leases or other

4

arrangements.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the consensual

6

relationship is what you just said, contracts, leases or

7

other commercial.

8

relationship.

9

So the consent is to the commercial

MR. BANKER:

Well, I mean, my interpretation

10

of that is -- I mean, Montana in its first exception

11

meant that the consent was in the consensual

12

relationship, then any business dealings with the tribe

13

or its members would result in tribal ability to

14

regulate, and that hasn't been the case, as this Court

15

has, you know, decided --

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the point of my

17

question was do you agree that there -- within the --

18

the description of the exception in Montana, that there

19

need not be a consent, either to the regulation or to an

20

adjudicatory jurisdiction to enforce the regulation?

21

MR. BANKER:

Not in the actual language of

22

Montana, but in reading Strate and in reading Hicks and

23

in reading Atkinson Trading Company, that is my

24

interpretation of the --

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So you're saying the

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Montana exception has been modified by later cases.

2

MR. BANKER:

That is correct.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Okay.
Certainly not in Strate,

5

which you quoted before as saying if you have

6

jurisdiction to regulate, then have you jurisdiction to

7

enforce the regulation.

8

MR. BANKER:

9
10

True, but I think Strate is an

important part of that history.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I thought that your

11

argument was that the general principle that was adopted

12

in Montana is the tribal jurisdiction extends only to

13

those things that are necessary to protect tribal

14

self-government or to control internal relations, and

15

that merely entering into consensual commercial

16

transactions doesn't fall within that, but if one were

17

to consent to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts,

18

then that would be an additional basis for jurisdiction.

19

I thought that was what your argument was.

20

MR. BANKER:

I believe that's correct.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if that's your argument

22

what's left of the first exception?

23

MR. BANKER:

Well, what's left of the first

24

exception is certainly a tribal ability to regulate, and

25

perhaps that's all.
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So the first -- but as I

2

understand it the first exception would have no

3

independent application unless the second exception were

4

met -- were satisfied, i.e., there was a tribal need

5

based on self-government, economic self-protection and

6

so on which, which would in effect validate the tribe's

7

attempt to regulate, which seems in effect to say that

8

everything turns on the second exception, not the first.

9

MR. BANKER:

Well, I think the first

10

exception could still have meaning, in the sense that it

11

grants the tribe the ability to regulate.

12

really is how far does that ability go and how far does

13

it stretch.

adjudication, and I further don't think it stretches to

15

adjudication of nonconsensual tort claims.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
I'd like to address both standing and the
merits, but because there are some additional wrinkles

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

on the standing question in light of how it was briefed

2

in the reply brief, I'd like to make three brief points

3

on the merits before addressing standing.

4

First, the bank engaged in a seven-year

5

business relationship with the Longs, knowing that they

6

were Indians and deriving substantial commercial

7

benefits from the Longs' tribal status through the BIA

8

loan guarantees.

9

tribal court jurisdiction over the breach of contract

Second, the bank has not challenged

10

claim or the bad faith claim, which are the core claims

11

in the case.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, they said they

13

don't need to because they said if they win on their

14

claim, then their whole case --

15

MR. FREDERICK:

And I'll address that,

16

Justice Ginsburg, on the general verdict point, which is

17

there is actually some law of this which I would like to

18

describe for the Court my understanding of.

19

point, though, is that both the district court and the

20

Eighth Circuit below found significant that the bank had

21

conceded tribal court jurisdiction in its motion for

22

summary judgment on its counterclaim, and they found

23

that concession to be important to note, and both courts

24

below found the Indian character of the Long family

25

company to be notable as well.

My third

Under this Court's two

26

2

significant respect.

3

Now, as to the standing question Justice

4

Ginsburg, let me get to your point on the general

5

verdict.

6

procedural law, how the tribal court would treat

7

vacature of a claim deemed to be an invalid claim.

This is ultimately a question of tribal

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Where do I look that

up in tribal law?
MR. FREDERICK:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, under

11

tribal law number 1, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe has

12

adopted the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for

13

procedure in the tribal courts, and under Federal Rules

14

of Civil Procedure 49, there are provisions for special

15

verdicts and general verdicts, and Rule 49(a)(3)

16

provides that if no specific objection is made to a fact

17

or finding requested by the jury, it is waived.

18

bank here did not make a specific objection to the

19

general interrogatory number 6, therefore, they may be

20

deemed to have waived their objection to having the

21

damages collected.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The

I'm sorry; I don't

23

understand.

I'm looking at joint appendix 191 to 192.

24

You have special interrogatories, including number 6 but

25

also number 4 and then they have damages.
27
Alderson Reporting Company

And it's not

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

clear whether those damages are based on the finding of

2

liability under 4 or 6.

3

MR. FREDERICK:

That's my point, Mr. Chief

4

Justice.

In the trial transcript which is contained at

5

roughly pages 555 through 562 of the tribal court

6

record, there was colloquy on how these special

7

interrogatories were to be framed.

8

number 4, the discrimination count on the ground that a

9

company cannot be discriminated against, only

The bank objected to

10

individuals can be discriminated against.

11

objection was sustained, and so special interrogatory 4

12

was written as you see it in the joint appendix.

13

bank did not object to the general verdict question on

14

damages, so the law on Rule 49(a)(3) would be that

15

special verdict is deemed to be waived, and now there is

MR. FREDERICK:

verdicts should be deemed, if there is an invalid claim,

there are competing views about what to do with that

when the damages awarded is treated as a general

verdict.

9

what you do when there has not been a specific objection

There is a circuit split on the question of

11

the tribal court, which would be looking to Federal law

to resolve the effect of a supposed tainted claim -- if

you were to conclude that a discrimination complaint is

a tainted claim -- would have to evaluate what effect

appropriate course would be to vacate and remand for the

23

the Federal rules mean whatever the tribal courts say

MR. FREDERICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, let me

4

step back and say I'm not here to advocate that there

5

can be different racial characteristics of corporations.

6

What is anomalous about this case and the way the BIA

7

has set up this program is that the BIA establishes

8

principles of Indian identity so that it can determine

9

whether it satisfies congressional mandates for Indian

10

financing.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I know the BIA

says that.

The facts

Well, I am sure the

A

bank dealing with an Indian-owned corporation, how are

10

they supposed to find out, or may they find out, whether

11

it's an Indian-owned corporation, particularly when

12

under your approach, when they do form that contract,

13

they are subjecting themselves to tribal-court

14

jurisdiction?
MR. FREDERICK:

15

I would acknowledge that

16

when there are no BIA loan guarantees required, a bank

17

may or may not know of the identity of the owners of the

18

corporation.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And do they subject

20

themselves to tribal-court jurisdiction because they are

21

dealing with, as you call it, an Indian corporation?

22

MR. FREDERICK:

Without further facts, no.

23

Here, though, the bank required the BIA loan.

24

on to the reservation to scrutinize the collateral.

25

required personal guarantees from the tribal members.

constitutes consent, but a commercial relationship with

In

I think, in general,

21

Mr. Chief Justice, I would agree with that hypothetical.

22

But here, if you took away the BIA loan piece, I think

the facts very strongly point to the bank knowing it was

24

engaging in a consensual relationship with Indians

25

because it went on tribal trust lands.

No.

has to arise out of that consensual relationship, which

it clearly does here.

the longevity of a relationship, the degree to which the

cause of action arose out of the answering of that ad.

I mean one of the features of -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

It's an odd sort of

basis on which to predicate jurisdiction.

12

when you're dealing with jurisdiction, we usually look

for a bright-line rule.

14

MR. FREDERICK:

We usually --

Well, I think that the

necessary concomitant of having tribes with their

elements of sovereignty residing within States and

within the United States is to have somewhat less

is that the bank did not avail itself of any of the

to move to dismiss the discrimination claim, to move for

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

about their point that, under our system, governing is

Mr. Frederick, before you

23

a lurking, underlying concern, and that is the the Chief

24

Justice brought up the outsider subjected to courts

25

where the outsider has no vote.

That happens when you

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sued in a State that's not your own, but there is the

2

right to remove and also at the end of the line is this

3

Court.

4

neither of those exist.

5

to a State or Federal court, and this Court has no

6

review authority over a tribal court's judgment.

And I think in the case of the tribal courts,

7

There's no -- you can't remove

MR. FREDERICK:

I have two suggested

8

responses to that, Justice Ginsburg.

One is that, when

9

a tribal court judgment needs to be enforced, it can be

10

brought in State court, and South Dakota follows the

11

comity rule, which means that it has to satisfy certain

12

requirements of fairness, adherence to basic principles,

13

and the law before a State -- the State court will

14

enforce the tribal court judgment.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15
16

Under national --

Not the same faith and

credit that it would give to a sister State judgment?

17

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

It's not

18

full faith and credit; it's comity.

19

provides for a substantive review while enforcing the

20

judgment.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that comity

Well, what if the

22

tribal law has certain cultural principles such as

23

fairness and equity of a sort that aren't recognized

24

under Federal or State law in this type of contractual

25

relationship?

Does that preclude the State court from
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

giving comity or not?
MR. FREDERICK:

The way the South Dakota

3

statute is worded, Mr. Chief Justice, unfortunately, I

4

can't give you a direct answer to that because it

5

involves a panoply of issues whether State law deems the

6

final judgment ultimately to be a fair one and -- and,

7

importantly, when this Court recognized the

8

jurisdictional point as giving rise to Federal

9

jurisdiction in National Farmers, I would submit it also

10

perhaps created the avenue for the enforcement of

11

judgments to be brought in Federal court as well.

12

don't understand why a jurisdictional challenge and a

13

challenge to the enforcement of a judgment could not

14

give rise to the same Federal question jurisdiction

15

recognized in National Farmers.

16

I

So I think there are two avenues to be in

17

State or Federal court when enforcing a judgment in

18

tribal court that heretofore for have not fully been

19

explored, certainly not by any decisions of this Court.

If the Court has no further questions.

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

2

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

3
4

MR. GANNON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the court:

This court's Montana framework confirms that

6

Indian tribes can, in some circumstances, exercise

7

legitimate authority over nonmembers and nonmember land

8

on their reservations.

9

criminal context, the political branches have not acted

Unlike what has happened in the

10

to divest tribes generally of civil jurisdiction over

11

nonmembers.

12

Congress and this Court have repeatedly articulated the

13

firm Federal policy of encouraging tribal

14

self-government and have recognized that tribal justice

15

systems are an essential part of tribal governments.

16

Both before and after Montana was decided,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that may be; it

17

depends on what you mean by "tribal."

18

certainly would be rational to say that all disputes

19

between members of the tribe can be resolved

20

authoritatively by the tribal court, but it's quite a

21

different thing to say that a dispute between a

22

nonmember of the tribe and a member of the tribe can go

23

to the tribal court.

24

home fried in a foreign State.

25

I mean, it

It's sort of the analogue to being

MR. GANNON:

It's -- is pretty close.

Well, Justice Scalia, that's of
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

course true, that there is a difference, but the Montana

2

framework recognizes that the political branches have

3

not completely divested tribes of their jurisdiction

4

over nonmembers in circumstances like this.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And --

Well, you agree with

6

your friend Mr. Frederick that Montana did not address

7

jurisdiction over a nonmember and that this would be the

8

first case in which we'd recognize such jurisdiction?

9

MR. GANNON:

Well, it did not specifically

10

address any previous cases involving jurisdiction over a

11

nonmember defendant who is hailed into Federal court.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. GANNON:

Defendant, yes.

But I think it is -- it is the

14

case that it clearly recognized a consensual

15

relationship that is established before the lawsuit

16

begins is what provides for regulatory jurisdiction in

17

some of the cases and adjudicatory jurisdiction, as is

18

now clear from Strate and the Court's subsequent

19

decisions.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In your view, does

21

jurisdiction follow all regulatory authority?

22

within regulatory authority, then is it your position

23

that there is necessarily jurisdiction to enforce in a

24

tribal court --

25

MR. GANNON:

Well -46

Alderson Reporting Company

If it's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

MR. GANNON:

-- in civil cases?

Well, in Iowa Mutual, this

3

Court did state that tribal courts are best qualified to

4

interpret and apply tribal law.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so --

In your position, is

6

regulatory jurisdiction concomitant with civil judicial

7

jurisdiction in the tribal court?

8

MR. GANNON:

Generally, yes.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What happens if the

10

bank deals with a corporation that is not an Indian

11

corporation, and then that --

12

corporation sell their shares to Indians?

the shareholders of that

13

MR. GANNON:

Well --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does the bank now

15

have a consensual relationship with an Indian

16

corporation?

17

MR. GANNON:

Well, I think, Mr. Chief

18

Justice, to expand upon the discussion that you were

19

having with Mr. Frederick, that the consensual

20

relationship that's necessary to establish jurisdiction

21

in the sense of Montana's first exception requires not

22

only that there be a consensual relationship with a

23

member, and which we do think that implicit in that is

24

some knowledge at least objective knowledge that you

25

knew you were dealing with a tribal member.
47
Alderson Reporting Company

And so if

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the conceptual relationship were established and with

2

somebody who was not a nonmember who subsequently ended

up through sales of shares to become a member, we don't

think that that ex post facto development would effect

5

the establishment of the original relationship.

that follows directly from the terms in Montana itself

because Montana says that the exceptions are are about

16

instances of, quote, "civil jurisdiction over

18

important factor.

19

And that's an

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but the only

20

reason -- the only reason the bank is on the reservation

21

is because the land was collateral, right?

22

MR. GANNON:

The only reason --

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They didn't want to

24

buy land on a reservation; they wanted to make a loan

25

and get the interest or whatever, and it just turned out
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the Indians defaulted, and therefore they were left

2

with a land on a reservation.

3

MR. GANNON:

Is that consensual?

Well, everything about this

4

transaction is related to the reservation.

5

part of it dealt with the land on the reservation, but

6

the rest of the ranch's operations, including places

7

where the bank possessed collateral and security

8

interest in personal property, were on tribal grazing

9

land.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

To be sure,

So if it's a

11

different -- the Indian -- the corporation is owned by

12

members on the reservation, the collateral they put up

13

is off the reservation, is there consensual dealings

14

with the corporation then?

15

MR. GANNON:

Well, the thing that's key

16

here, I believe, is that the subject of the contract was

17

intimately connected with the reservation itself, and

18

that's why it comes within Montana's discussion of civil

19

jurisdiction.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, but the subject

21

of the contract is loan to a corporation owned by

22

Indians on the reservation.

23

other land that the corporation owns or the individuals

24

MR. GANNON:

What's important here is that the subject

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess, what I

meant, what do you mean by the subject of the contract?

7

MR. GANNON:

Well, the loan here was for

8

specific purposes.

It was for -- I mean, there were a

9

lot of specific terms in which the bank dictated lots of

10

practices on the ranch, and it knew everything about the

11

way the operation was being conducted or required

like that.

And so, this is not an instance where a

And indeed in Blaze Construction the court

15
16

addressed a case in which there was a member-owned

17

corporation that was doing business on a different

18

reservation, and the parties conceded there that that

19

would not be considered to be a member for purposes of

20

Montana -- that was actually a taxation case, but it

21

would not be considered a member for purposes of these

22

exceptions.

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. GANNON:

Well, that's generally correct,

2

Justice Scalia.

There is a little bit of a dispute in

3

the probate proceedings about exactly the status of the

5

of the deed to the bank, and therefore, at that point it

would have been -- to the extent that that transfer was

MR. GANNON:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

And the

Montana exception to deal with jurisdiction --

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Does "on the land" mean --

"on the reservation" mean land on the reservation or

7

does it extend any further than that?

MR. GANNON:

I -- I -- I can't say --

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let's say an Indian gets an

10

auto loan for a vehicle to be used in a business on the

11

12

Is that on the reservation?
MR. GANNON:

In general, the sale of goods

13

off the reservation, unless there is some particularly

14

intimate connection with the reservation that -- that

15

the parties anticipate at the time, probably isn't going

16

to be enough to trigger jurisdiction.

Yes.

52
Alderson Reporting Company

Whatever home equity

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. GANNON:

Yes.

I think that that's -- if

2

it were going to be used for something completely off

3

the reservation, then maybe an argument could be made

4

that it doesn't have enough to do with regulating

5

activities that are occurring on the reservation.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, they are going

7

to add -- add a new wing onto the -- new room on to

8

their home.

9
10

MR. GANNON:

And that's an example where I

do think that --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if Chase

12

Manhattan gets a home equity loan application from

13

somebody and they grant the home equity loan, they are

14

now subject to being sued in tribal court?
MR. GANNON:

15

If they know that they are

16

dealing with a member and they have not included any

17

form selection or choice of law provisions that say that

18

they want to be sued and resolve disputes in some other

19

forum, then it may well be the case that they will be

20

sued in tribal court.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if the tribal

22

court has a rule that forum selection provisions are not

23

enforceable?

24
25

MR. GANNON:

Well, I think it's probably

unlikely that the tribal courts would -- or that the
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

tribe would adopt a rule like that, because as a

2

pragmatic matter it would make it more difficult for

3

their citizens to engage in business relationships if

4

they had a categorical ban like that.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so --

But then could you go

6

into Federal court under what was in farmers and say we

7

had no jurisdiction because we had a forum selection

8

clause?

9

MR. GANNON:

I -- if -- if there was a forum

10

that would be a question about the nature of the

11

underlyng consent.

12

forum selection clauses here ought to be enforced.

13

so, it would be relevant to the scope of the consentual

14

relationship there.

15

And I do think that, in general,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Does the judgment

16

here that the bank discriminated against the Indian

17

corporation because they didn't give them as favorable

terms as they gave someone who hadn't defaulted on a

loan impede dealings with Indian corporations by outside

20

members -- outside nonmembers?

21

MR. GANNON:

Well, as was pointed out

22

earlier, Mr. Chief Justice, the -- the -- the only

23

duties that the bank was exposed to here were a duty not

to breach contracts and not to discriminate.

Congress is aware of

What do

10

Process Clause if it's an Indian court?

11

same as if we assign this to the American Arbitration

12

Association.

MR. BANKER:
