CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in case 06-6330, Kimbrough versus United States.

5

Mr. Nachmanoff.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL NACHMANOFF

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Derrick Kimbrough's case is about what a

11

district court may consider when imposing sentence in

12

conformity with Section 3553(a).

13

That statute directs sentencing courts to do

14

exactly what Judge Jackson did in this case.

He

15

properly calculated and considered the advisory

16

guideline range, the Sentencing Commission's reports,

17

Mr. Kimbrough's personal history and background, and the

18

offense itself, as directed by the statute. He then made

19

case-specific findings to impose an appropriate

20

sentence, and he did not make any categorical

21

determinations.

22

The Fourth Circuit reversed, applying a

23

per se rule prohibiting disagreement with the crack

24

cocaine guideline.

25

argues that Congress has implicitly directed sentencing

The government, on the other hand,

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

courts to adhere to the crack guidelines.

2

Both of these positions are wrong.

3

With respect to the Fourth Circuit, the

4

Fourth Circuit applied a rigid rule that prohibited any

5

disagreement with the crack guideline, which is

6

determined solely by drug type and quantity. They then

7

prohibited the imposition of any sentence outside the

8

guideline range, either above it or below it, unless the

9

court identified facts specific to the defendant or the

10
11

offense.
This ruling is inconsistent with the Court's

12

holdings in Cunningham and Rita, which hold that the

13

courts must be free to disagree with policies.

14

Finally, the Fourth Circuit required that

15

those facts be atypical, which mirrors the exact

16

language that was excised in 3553(b)(1).

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could the Congress have

18

mandated the result and the rationale that the Fourth

19

Circuit used here?

20

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Your Honor, Congress can

21

certainly speak explicitly through its statutes to

22

impose further refinements on the penalty structure that

23

it set out in 841.

24
25

Section 841, on its face, does no more than
set mandatory minimums and maximums at two triggering

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

quantities.

2

triggering quantities which would cabin the discretion

3

of sentencing courts, they could do so, but they have

4

not done so and there is no canon of statutory

5

construction that the government identifies or that I'm

6

aware of that would justify the notion of the implicit

7

binding directive.

8
9

If Congress wanted to specify further

JUSTICE ALITO:

If Congress made a finding

that crack and cocaine are equally dangerous and passed

10

a statute that said, for sentencing purposes, every

11

district judge shall treat cases involving these two

12

substances exactly the same, would there be a Sixth

13

Amendment problem with that?

14

district judge gets the right to make that policy

15

decision individually?

16

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Or do you think every

Justice Alito, Congress

17

certainly can cabin the discretion of judges.

18

they set a floor and a ceiling, pursuant to this Court's

19

remedial holding in Booker, judges must be free to

20

consider the entire range of punishment.

21

relies on the notion that the Guidelines are now fully

22

advisory and, therefore, judges without having to

23

identify specific facts have to have the discretion to

24

disagree with policies or identify things unique to the

25

case in order to fashion an appropriate punishment.
5

And Booker

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What's your answer simply

2

to the very simple argument that because the floor was

3

set on the assumption of a 100 to 1 ratio, set by

4

Congress, that any other sentencing assumption,

5

regardless of the particular justifications in a given

6

case, is simply incoherent with the statutory scheme and

7

for that reason should be regarded as unreasonable?

8

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Yes, Your Honor.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It is the coherence problem

10
11

that is bothering us.
MR. NACHMANOFF:

Yes.

There are several

12

answers to that question, Justice Souter.

The first is

13

that this Court has recognized with the same statute

14

which has the same structure that the government argues

15

can only logically be understood one way, that with

16

regard to the weight for LSD in the case of Neal versus

17

United States, it is perfectly appropriate for there to

18

be two different methods of calculating weight for

19

purposes of punishment.

20

based on a presumed weight of the combination of the LSD

21

and the blotter paper or the carrier medium.

22

statute defines the method for calculating the mandatory

23

minimum by the combined weight of the LSD and the

24

blotter paper, regardless of whether it is heavy or

25

whether it is light.

The Guidelines calculate weight

6
Alderson Reporting Company

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But is that an argument for

2

saying, well, in the LSD case, you approved of

3

incoherence and irrationality, therefore, you want to do

4

it across the board?

5

here on the merits regardless of Neal that there is an

6

incoherence between the minimum and the kind of

7

discretion that you're talking about.

8
9

I mean, there is still an argument

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Well, Your Honor, I think

what Neal reflects is that there's no implicit binding

10

policy directive in 841 itself that requires either the

11

Commission or sentencing courts to follow in lock step

12

on a graduated proportionate scheme, whatever it is that

13

Congress decided with respect to two specific triggers

14

should be the case.

15
16
17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Did we have the cliff

problem in the LSD case?
MR. NACHMANOFF:

Yes, Your Honor.

The Court

18

recognized that, in fact, cliffs are the inevitable

19

results of mandatory minimums.

20
21
22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So we are in the same boat,

then, you say with Neal in that respect, too?
MR. NACHMANOFF:

Yes, and Your Honor, if I

23

could also point out that there really is a myth here

24

with regard to the 100 to 1 ratio as it stands now and

25

as the Commission created it in 1987.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

The 100 to 1

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ratio describes the relative weight of crack cocaine and

2

powder cocaine with regard to the levels in the

3

sentencing table; so that if you compare, for example,

4

the 10-year mandatory minimum trigger, 50 grams of

5

crack, that gets you to a level 32 in the sentencing

6

table and it requires 5 kilos of powder cocaine or 5,000

7

grams.

8
9

That's the 100 to 1 ratio.
And it is true that if one compares the low

end of that table -- 5 kilos to 50 grams, you end up

10

with the same punishment, or likewise, if you compare

11

the top of the range, 15 kilos to a 150 grams.

12

But the way the guidelines have been

13

written, there are a multitude of ratios that get

14

applied right now and were applied in the pre-Booker

15

guidelines scheme.

16

In other words, 14.9 kilos of powder

17

compared to 51 grams of crack results in a 292 to 1

18

ratio.

19

32.

20

You get the exact same punishment, it is a level

Likewise if you flip it, and you compare 149

21

grams of crack to 5 kilos of powder cocaine, you are

22

still within a level 32, and it is a 34 to 1 ratio.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe that was wrong.

24

Maybe the Sentencing Commission should have, in order to

25

be faithful to the Congressional determination, should
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have done it quite proportionately.

2

hung up on what the Sentencing Commission said.

3

hung up on what the courts should do now.

4

MR. NACHMANOFF:

I mean, I'm not
I'm

I agree, Justice Scalia.

5

And of course, the Sentencing Commission taken to the

6

ultimate extreme would have had to have a proportionate

7

sentencing table by gram or fraction of a gram in order

8

to preserve the 100 to 1 ratio, which simply points out

9

in combination with Neal the fact that this was a choice

10

made by the Commission, a choice, by the way, not

11

grounded on any empirical evidence or any other reason

12

other than what 841 originally indicated.

13

It could have been done differently.

It is

14

done differently with regard to other drugs in 841, such

15

as LSD or such as marijuana plants, which have a

16

different method for calculation under the Guidelines as

17

they do for purposes of mandatory minimums.

18

course, what that means is that there is no implicit

19

directive, which is the only rational -

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And, of

That just goes back to

21

Justice Scalia's point.

22

implicit Congressional directive that the Commission did

23

not follow.

24
25

There may very well be an

Well -- Your Honor,

MR. NACHMANOFF:

It did not reject them, you

So, therefore, in effect, there was a

Well, Congress did not

5

reject the original table that was created by the

6

Commission in 1987.

7

did not at any time in Section 994, which is where it

8

has given other explicit directions to the Commission to

9

fashion guidelines in a particular way, say anything

That is correct.

But Congress also

10

about how to fashion the punishment for crack cocaine or

11

any of the other drugs in Section 841.

12
13
14

So Congress understands if it wants to give
further guidance to the Commission how to do it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Nachmanoff, in the

15

absence of anything further from Congress, and accepting

16

your argument that there's no -- that the Guidelines did

17

not have to adopt the ratio that is applicable to the

18

mandatory minimum, could a district judge then say, I

19

see that this disparity is untenable, but I think drugs

20

are a very bad thing, so I'm going to sentence for

21

powder as high as for crack?

22

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Justice Ginsburg, our rule

23

certainly contemplates the fact that there may be

24

circumstances in which district judges may come to

25

conclusions about the appropriate sentence, taking into
10

consideration the purposes of sentencing and the

2

parsimony provision -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if we throw out the

100 to 1, what is the range open to the district

judge -- hundred to one is okay, but I have to use

6

the -- I'm going to use the crack for both?

7

there is a difference between the two, so I'm going to

set it at 20 to 1 and another judge 5 to 1.

What if the Fourth Circuit

Mr. Kimbrough's, and it is apparent in one, the

the next one has used 100 to 1, what is it to do under

6

MR. NACHMANOFF:

The court of appeals has

7

been given explicit instruction by this Court that it is

8

to review all of those sentences under an abuse of

9

discretion, which means that its job is not to

10

substitute its judgment for the lower court.

mandates of 3553(a), but then impose a sentence that

8

meets the purposes of sentencing and is consistent with

9

the parsimony provision, there may well be judges that

That is the clear holding

When judges have that full

10

come to different conclusions, as your hypothetical

11

posits, about what people with similar or even identical

12

records and identical circumstances may -- may do.

13

I would say that the reality is in the

14

lower courts no two cases are alike, and so there are

15

always reasons for judges to make reasoned distinctions

16

in imposing sentences, even where, for example, the drug

17

type and quantity is identical.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I take it your answer

19

is that all or most of those cases would be affirmed

22

MR. NACHMANOFF:

If -- yes.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If you were representing

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Well, Justice Souter, if

2

the court followed the procedural requirements of

3

3553(a), if the information was subjected to the

4

adversarial process, and if the court imposed a sentence

5

consistent with the parsimony clause, it would be hard

6

to imagine a basis upon which to object.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

The basis is that that

8

would be the end of the Guidelines.

9

every judge has his own view of policy and there is a

10

vast range.

11

but I don't think this Court said it, and I think that

12

the test is supposed to be reasonableness, and I think

13

3553(a) does have a lot of instructions, and one of the

14

major thrusts is follow the Guidelines.

But they're in there.

All right,

so the problem for me is just

17

what Justice Alito was saying:

18

between saying, well, judge, leaving everything special

19

about your case out of it -- we're only talking about a

20

judge who says there's nothing special about my case -

21

I disagree with the policy of the commission.

22

Is there a path here

In such a case, is there a choice between

23

saying that no matter what the commission says, the

24

court of appeals must insist that their district judges

25

follow in terms of a policy; and the opposite, which is
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to say they don't have to do anything that the

2

commission says, because the commission is always

3

choosing among reasonable choices.

4

you have one in this case -- but very rarely is it

5

totally unreasonable.

Very rarely -- maybe

6

How do we thread the channel?

7

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Justice Breyer, the Booker

8

remedial opinion makes it crystal-clear that to avoid

9

the Sixth Amendment problem with the mandatory

10

Guidelines, judges must be free to disagree with the

11

Guidelines.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

To the extent that it's

13

reasonable, and where we're talking about individual

14

cases we've already said, given the history of our legal

15

system, it's very reasonable to give lots of discretion

16

to the district judge.

17

Now we're talking about what's reasonable in

18

the context of 3553(a); and I don't think Booker says

19

one way or the other on that, nor I do believe Rita says

20

one way or the other.

21
22
23

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Your Honor, 3553(a) is

driven by the purposes of sentencing.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Driven by a Congress that

wrote guidelines; and at the last minute, in a separate

25

matter that we've taken out and wasn't put in the
15
Alderson Reporting Company

2

history of 3553(a) is a history of a statute that is

3

seeking uniformity through guidelines.

4

At least that's my view of it.

So the

And for

5

purposes of the question, which is an important question

6

to me, let's assume that.

7

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Well, Your Honor, the

8

appellate courts still have a role to play and that role

9

is to ensure that the sentencing courts have followed

10

the mandate of 3553(a), and that -

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Indeed, it may be quite

12

impossible to achieve uniformity through advisory

13

guidelines, which is why Congress made them mandatory.

(Laughter.)

15

MR. NACHMANOFF:

That very well may be,

Justice Scalia.

That is correct, Justice

And is "reasonable"

something else, like a just sentence?
17
Alderson Reporting Company

What -- how do we

Official - Subject to Final Review

define "reasonable"?

2
3
4

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Well, Your Honor, I think

that that JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Whether or not the

5

commission and then the district judge reasonably

6

interpret the congressional intent, and if the

7

commission reasonably interprets the congressional

8

intent is the district court allowed to disregard that?

9

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Sentencing courts must be

10

able to disagree with the commission's conclusions about

11

congressional intent.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

was reasonable, can they still disagree?

14

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Assuming the commission

Yes, Your Honor.

I think

15

that is the essence of the Booker remedial holding, that

16

in order to cure the constitutional problem with

17

mandatory guidelines, judges must be free to reject,

18

must be free to reject those guidelines.

19

Cunningham makes that clear, that in the California

20

determinate sentencing area it was the inability of

21

judges to impose a higher sentence based on the general

22

objectives of sentencing, as opposed to particular

23

factors or circumstances in aggravation, that made it

24

unconstitutional.

25

that the congressional intent was to import the 100 to 1

And in fact

So whether the commission concluded

18
Alderson Reporting Company

ratio or not -- and clearly there is no statutory

2

construction that can be inferred or understood from 841

3

by itself.

4

concedes that.

5

It is not explicit and the government

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So in your case you ask us

6

to establish the proposition that in any case, a

7

sentencing judge must always be free to disregard a

8

reasonable interpretation of the Commission, a

9

reasonable interpretation of a congressional statute?

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I interrupt before you

11

answer.

The question isn't whether they can justify a

12

reasonable.

13

one that creates unwarranted disparities within the

14

meaning of the statute.

15
16

It's whether they can justify not following

MR. NACHMANOFF:

That's -- that's correct,

Justice Stevens.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You would go further -

18

you would go further and -- and submit to us the

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Well, Your Honor, if -- if

I understood it correctly, the question is whether or

sentencing; and, of course, they themselves have made

that conclusion, and for sentencing purposes -

And of course here is perhaps the paradigmatic

submission is that the district court must be able to

make the determination that the commission's policy is

to be disregarded in every case to come before the

court?

21

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Well, Your Honor, 3553(a)

22

requires individualized sentencing.

23

that judges are required to follow in every case the

24

mandates of 3553(a) and to calculate the advisory

Guidelines correctly.
20
Alderson Reporting Company

There's no question

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Now, there is no reason why judges cannot in

2

a certain class of cases conclude that the Guideline

3

gets it wrong; that it overstates the seriousness of the

4

offense; that it creates an unwarranted disparity; and

5

that they are going to impose a sentence outside of that

6

guideline range.

7

That does not in any way remove the

8

requirement that they subject every sentencing to the

9

adversarial process to give the parties the opportunity

10

to convince them that the guidelines should be followed,

11

or not followed, or to be reconsidered.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And Mr. Nachmanoff, I

13

think that you are agreeing, although you don't want to

14

come right out and say it, with Justice Scalia's point;

15

that is, anything from a hundred to one down to one to

16

one is open to the district judge; and within that

17

range, there is no abuse of discretion.

18

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Your Honor, I certainly

19

agree that that full range is available to the

20

sentencing court.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Only because Congress has

22

said 100 to 1.

That strikes me as utterly unreasonable.

23

But if Congress has said it, it can't be unreasonable.

24

That's what makes that an easy hypothetical, but that

25

would not be the normal case, that a 100 to 1 disparity
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

wouldn't be -- would not be unreasonable.

2

MR. NACHMANOFF:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, Your Honor.
In any case, your answer

4

is anything from what Congress has said, down to one to

5

one, would be a reasonable sentence that would be -

6

that would pass muster on appeal because it is not an

7

abuse of discretion.

8
9

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Well, if I can be clear,

Justice Ginsburg, sentencing courts must have available

10

to them the full range of punishment as defined by

11

Congress.

12

broad ranges based on triggering quantities at 5 grams

13

and 50 grams for crack cocaine.

14

long as the court follows the requirements of 3553(a),

15

considers all the purposes of sentencing, engages in an

16

individualized sentencing process, and relies on

17

relevant and reliable information, there would be no

18

basis under abuse of discretion review to reverse the

19

sentencing court in that instance.

20

And that range, for purposes of 841, are

Within those ranges, as

But you've given me a

bunch of hand holds that, quite frankly, are quite easy

22

for a district judge to say:

23

and I'm going to go through every one of them; but in

24

the end I think the ratio should be 20 to 1; and that's

25

what I'm going to impose.

Here's my laundry list;

MR. NACHMANOFF:

Well, again, Your Honor,

2

Congress certainly has the power to cabin that

discretion.

4

they have not done so.

5

They just need to do it explicitly, and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -- Congress not having

done that, then the range is open to the district

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the court:
The question in this case is essentially,

17

can a district court reasonably disagree with the

18

judgment of Congress concerning the ratio between the

19

quantity-based sentences for crack and powder.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Dreeben, can I ask a

21

question right at the outset that is critical for me.

22

think this case may well be controlled by the decision

23

in Neal against the United States, which is not cited in

24

the government brief and wasn't cited in the blue brief.

25

But there the Court held that a policy
23
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judgment by Congress fixing mandatory minimums on the

2

basis of the weight of the carrier rather than the drug

3

did not justify guidelines based on that ratio -- based

4

on the same principle -- if that would produce

5

unwarranted disparities.

6

And, as I understand the facts of this case,

7

the Commission has told us actually in some of its

8

reports that the 100 to 1 ratio does produce unwarranted

9

disparities.

Therefore, we should disregard the entire

10

guideline as we did in Neal, and the reason the Neal

11

case is controlling in this case.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Stevens, let me start

13

with the Neal decision, because I think Neal is

14

fundamentally unlike this case.

15

to determine whether its prior construction of a

16

statute, Section 841, survived the Commission's

17

decision -

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In Neal this Court had

But that is a construction

19

of what Congress intended, and for purposes of decision

20

we assumed that Congress intended what we held the

21

statute meant.

22

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Stevens, the only

23

question presented in Neal was, did the Commission's

24

weight guideline for LSD require this Court to change

25

its interpretation of Section 841.
24
Alderson Reporting Company

And the Court held

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

no.

2

There was no question before the Court about

3

whether the Sentencing Commission had legitimately

4

adopted a different formula than the mixture or

5

substance rule that this Court had held governed the

6

statute.

7

The LSD guideline was not in play in Neal.

8

The government never challenged it.

9

not at issue.

Its rationality was

All the Court had to hold was that

10

whatever the Sentencing Commission did -

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It does hold that a

12

guideline that does not conform with a congressional

13

judgment merely expressed in a mandatory minimum is a

14

guideline that would survive.

15

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I disagree with that,

16

Justice Stevens, because no one challenged the guideline

17

in Neal.

18

decide about whether that Guideline was valid.

19

if the Court thought that Neal does involve some sort of

20

a principle that the Sentencing Commission has greater

21

freedom to vary from the procedures laid out in a

22

mandatory minimum sentencing statute, Neal does not

23

control this case, because there is more data about what

24

Congress intended the ratio between crack and powder to

25

be, and because Congress changed the basic, organic

There was nothing at issue in the Court to

Alderson Reporting Company

But even

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute that governs the Sentencing Commission's -

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but there's also more

3

data that the Commission has reflected on all this and

4

still concludes that the 100 to 1 ratio creates an

5

unwarranted disparity which is contrary to the statute.

6

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the statute, itself,

7

Section 841, establishes the ratio of a 100 to 1.

8

the Commission first considered creating drug

9

guidelines -

10
11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

When

It establishes the ratio

for mandatory minimum purposes only, is what Neal held.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Well I disagree with that,

13

Justice Stevens, and I'm trying to explain why the legal

14

context is different from the legal context in Neal.

15

Let me start with a couple of points about

16

this.

17

drug Guideline initially, it conformed it to the 100 to

18

1 ratio that existed under the mandatory minimum

19

sentencing statute, because it recognized -- and these

20

were the Commission's words -- that a logical and

21

coherent sentencing scheme required that there be

22

consistent proportionality throughout the sentencing

23

process.

24
25

First of all, when the Commission promulgated the

When the Commission later studied the
crack-powder ratio and concluded that Congress had
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

gotten it wrong and, therefore, the Commission, itself,

2

had gotten it wrong by conforming to what Congress did,

3

it proposed a Guideline that would have changed the

4

ratio for Guideline's purposes only to one to one

5

between crack and powder.

6

And Congress, for the first time in the

7

history of its review of Guidelines amendments, rejected

8

that proposal; and it did so with legislation that made

9

clear that it believed that if the commission wanted to

10

come back with something new, it should propose

11

something that would change both the Guidelines and the

12

sentencing statutes so that they would continue to work

13

in tandem -- that it would preserve a higher ratio of

14

punishment for crack than powder because it believed

15

that crack was more serious, and that it believed that

16

any ratio should apply consistently across the

17

Guidelines and the statute.

18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And if -- you're

talking about Public Law 104-38?

20

MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, they also

22

said, quote, "The sentence imposed for trafficking in

23

crack cocaine should generally exceed the sentence for

24

powder cocaine."

25

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's fine,

4

terms -- you are relying on this implicit directive from

5

Congress.

6

congressional implicit direction, and it just says

7

"generally exceed."

8

"Generally

And that's the latest expression of

So, you know, two to one.

MR. DREEBEN:

This, Mr. Chief Justice, is

9

what Congress instructed the Commission to consider in

10

making recommendations to change the existing state of

11

the law.

12

We don't dispute -

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well I know, but you

14

are relying on an implicit directive anyway.

15

are looking at that vague direction, it seems to me that

16

their last expression on what they wanted the Commission

17

to do is more probative than a much older pre-existing

18

100 to 1 ratio.

19

MR. DREEBEN:

So as you

But they have never changed

20

the 100 to 1 ratio.

And what I think is significant

21

about this statute is what it continues to say, and this

22

is on page 124-A of the government's brief -- that "the

23

recommendations concerning an appropriate change to the

24

ratio that the Commission might believe is warranted

25

shall apply both to the relevant statutes and to the
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Guidelines."

2

24-A to 25-A.

3

This is on the carryover sentence on pages

And what I think that this reflects is

4

Congress' recognition that, so long as the mandatory

5

minimum statutes are pegged at 100 to 1, the Guidelines

6

need to follow suit.

7

that's fine.

8

consistent so as to avoid unwarranted disparities

9

between defendants who are governed by the literal

10

Now if they're going to change,

But they should change in a manner that's

mandatory minimum statute and defendants who are not.

11

The alternative is you end up with various

12

serious cliff effects which the Commission itself was

13

trying to avoid, where a defendant who has 50 grams of

14

crack is sentenced to a minimum of 10 years.

15

drop the ratio to one to one, a defendant who has

16

49.9 grams -

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if you

But those are the same

18

cliff effects that are the product of Neal, precisely

19

the same.

20

MR. DREEBEN:

But this Court didn't consider

21

whether those cliff effects were legally valid in Neal

22

because it had no guideline before it.

23

to get to the other point that I think distinguishes the

24

legal context in Neal from the legal context today, and

25

that is, in 2003, Congress amended the organic statute
29
Alderson Reporting Company

And I did went

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that governs the Sentencing Commission's promulgation of

2

Guidelines to require that the commission make AUDIO

3

STARTS its Guidelines consistent with all pertinent

4

provisions of the United States Code.

5

At the time of Neal, that statute only

6

required the commission to be consistent with Title 18

7

and Title 28, and the drug statute is found in Title 21.

8

And the legislative evolution of this provision reflects

9

that there was concern that the commission did not have

10

to honor -

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In response to that

12

statute, did the commission revise the guideline that

13

was involved in Neal?

14
15

MR. DREEBEN:

It did not, and the government

--

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

17

MR. DREEBEN:

Shouldn't it have done it?

I think it should have, and I

18

think that the commission's decoupling of its guidelines

19

from the mandatory minimums that Congress has provided

20

produces an irrational disconnect between guideline

21

sentencing and sentencing -

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's because of the

23

cliff.

But the cliff is undoubledly a negative, but the

24

cliff is not as important as sometimes suggested, for

25

the numbers after all, which relate punishment to
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

amounts of drug, reflect, (a), more seriousness than

2

what you have -- I mean more people likely to take it -

3

but also the role that the person is likely to play in

4

the organization, high or low, and the likelihood that

5

he is or this -- these groups of people are big deal

6

offenders or not, and many other things.

7

Therefore, a system that really is basically

8

flat or only rises slowly until you get to the cliff,

9

and then it again rises slowly to the next rise, is not

10

an irrational system.

11

correlations are.

12

noticing the horrendous effects of this -- that the

13

commission itself has listed and understanding that

14

cliffs are not the end-all and the be-all of Guidelines

15

that are rough correlations, suppose a judge said:

24

matter, the government accepts that a sentencing judge

policy determinations as an intrinsic feature of an

2

advisory guideline system.

3

that result, but because we think that it followed from

4

this Court's decision in Cunningham and that was

5

expressly stated in Rita.

6

It's not because we welcome

But this is not an area where the sentencing

7

courts would be merely second-guessing a commission

judgment.

9

Congress itself.

10
11

They would be second-guessing a judgment of

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, because Congress has

nowhere said that you can't have cliffs.

12

You see, Congress could say, our rough

13

judgment is that 5 Gs of hard -- of crack really is kind

14

of a correlation with a medium-level gang, and 50 Gs is

15

probably a correlation with a fairly high-level gang.

16

And what has Congress actually thought about this?

17

Nothing.

18
19
20
21

time when the commission tried to do that JUSTICE BREYER:

change the sentencing statutes and guidelines in tandem,

that's fine, make a recommendation.

4

has made a judgment that until it says otherwise,

sentencing ratios of 100 to 1 are appropriate to reflect

the increased harms of crack.

Isn't your answer also to

MR. DREEBEN:

on what the Sentencing Commission itself did before it

5

the commission's original commentary where it explained,

8

in the first full paragraph, how it set the basic levels

And this is set forward -- forth at page
This was

And it said that it set them because

10

they were either provided directly by Section 841 of

11

Title 21 or, quote, "are proportional to the levels

12

established by statute," and it said, further refinement

13

of the drug amounts beyond those mandatory minimums was

14

essential to provide a logical sentencing structure for

15

drug offenses.

16

And I think what the commission -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's why -- and the

17

1993 statute that you said, that you referred to, did

indeed require the guidelines to track the -- the

4

are still just advisory.

5

MR. DREEBEN:

The guidelines themselves

What distinguishes this area,

6

Justice Scalia, I believe, from other guidelines is that

7

the backdrop for sentencing for drug crimes is a

8

mandatory minimum statute that goes directly to the

9

sentencing court.

It's not subject to the commission's

10

intervention and it's not subject to a district court's

11

power to disagree with.

12

100 to 1 ratio in applying the mandatory minimums.

13

The sentencing court must use a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, why don't you just

14

skip the Guidelines and say that the effect of the

15

sentencing statute is to make it unreasonable for a

16

sentencing judge -- never mind the Guidelines -- to do

17

anything other than follow the 100 to 1 prescription

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I'm happy to do just -

I don't know what the

another stage.

23

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, if -- if it's sufficient

24

for the Court that Section 841 itself establishes the

25

100 to 1 ratio and that's something that's off-limits
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for the district courts to disagree with, I'm content.

2

I think there is additional data that

3

indicates that Congress vetoed attempts by the

4

Sentencing Commission to vary from that range and made

5

it clear that the Guidelines formulations and the

6

statute worked in tandem, which together expresses a

7

notion of quantity proportionality tied to the 100 to 1

8

ratio.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I would say that that

10

statute reflects Congress's desire that sentencing,

11

whether it's through the commission or not, be based on

12

the 100 to 1 ratio.

13

MR. DREEBEN:

And I agree with that, Justice

14

Scalia.

15

is what various district courts have done but no court

16

of appeals has endorsed, is that every district court

17

could come up with its own ratio and that that ratio

18

would have to be accepted as reasonable so long as there

19

is a cogent, logical data support for it.

20

And the upshot of disagreeing with that, which

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And here -

But is it not true that

21

that only affects about 20 percent of the crack cocaine

22

cases, because they say -- maybe I'm wrong on this -

23

that 80 percent of the sentences are actually fixed by

24

the mandatory minimum?

25

MR. DREEBEN:

There's a floor in the
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

mandatory minimum, but I think that there are quite a

2

few sentences that are above the mandatory minimum and

3

there are sentences that are below the mandatory

4

minimum.

And in those cases -

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I was -- and correct me if

6

I'm wrong.

7

of the sentences that are actually imposed are at the

8

13

figures so I could answer your question.

14

The

But I do think that, even if it's true, even

if 80 percent were at the mandatory minimum, that would

16

mean that as to those 20 percent that are not governed

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, Mr. Dreeben,

something, there's a way to do it.

through both houses, then the President signs it.

That's the only way they can give legal effect to their

Now you are arguing that there's some

23

binding intent simply because they set mandatory

24

minimums and mandatory maximums that carry beyond that.

25

I'm wondering how that's consistent with the positions
38
Alderson Reporting Company

the office has taken before.
MR. DREEBEN:

Our position here, I think, is

3

consistent with our view that you read statutes both for

4

what they say and for what they mean.

5

not relying just on Section 841, although I'm certainly

6

happy if members of the Court believe that 841 alone

7

dictates a proportionality rule, I'm also relying on the

8

fact that Congress vetoed the Commission's attempt to

9

break apart the Guidelines in the sentencing -

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And here we are

We should read a

11

negative pregnant in the Congress' vetoing of what the

12

Commission wanted to do?

13

MR. DREEBEN:

At least the Court should do

14

this much, that when a court of appeals is reviewing for

15

reasonableness a sentence imposed by a district judge,

16

the court of appeals should refract the Section 3553(a)

17

factors through Congress' existing judgment that a 100

18

to 1 ratio is warranted.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

If Congress passes a

20

statute that says the mandatory minimum sentence of

21

eight years for possessing a 12-inch shotgun unlawfully,

22

does that mean it wants four years for a 6-inch shotgun?

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. DREEBEN:

25

It doesn't.

But, Justice

Breyer, that's, for two different reasons, not an apt
39
Alderson Reporting Company

analogy for this.

2

100 to 1 ratio at two different points in the sentencing

3

spectrum.

4

First of all, Congress applied the

Then if there was a rational basis for

viewing shotgun culpability as turning on the length of

the barrel, then perhaps there would be a better

7

analogy.

8

was the relative culpability of crack offenders and

9

powder offenders.

10

But I think here what Congress was focused on

JUSTICE BREYER:

At the cliff.

But, of

11

course, I've been through -- I hope not being hypnotized

12

by numbers myself -- that these numbers reflect

13

underlying realities that are far closer to the shotgun

14

case than you are prepared to admit.

15

MR. DREEBEN:

No, but I think that Congress

16

doesn't view the Guidelines quantity determinations as

17

being independent from its mandatory minimum

18

determinations.

19

Commission's unilateral attempt to impose a one to one

20

ratio -

21

And that's why it vetoed the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And then are you saying

22

that either the guidelines are out of it and the statute

23

controls, the ratio is a 100 to 1, or that Congress has,

24

in effect, made a particular guideline, the one setting

25

the drug quantity, made that mandatory?
40
Alderson Reporting Company

That

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

guideline -- I mean, it sounds to me that if you must

2

adhere to the 100 to 1, then that's a mandatory

3

guideline.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

They do come down to the same

5

thing, Justice Ginsburg, in the sense that the guideline

6

as it exists today incorporates the 100 to 1 ratio.

7

I believe that Congress well understood that it was

preserving a guideline that maintains fidelity and

9

consistency with its sentencing statute while sending

And

10

the Commission back to the drawing board and saying if

we're going to change this scheme, let's change it in a

13

not get the power to say we're going to change what

14

Congress has prohibited the Commission from changing,

15

even though we can't change the mandatory minimum

statute.

17

And every district court does

That is Congress' sentencing policy.

We

18

have to impose that in cases at the mandatory minimum.

19

But in cases that aren't at the mandatory minimum, the

20

position of the petitioner is basically district judges

21

can say to Congress, you're completely wrong.

22

position is that under a sympathetic attempt to

23

construct reasonableness review that is consistent with

24

Congressional intent, a district court can't do that.

13

MR. DREEBEN:

I'm not aware that they have

15

And I think that since all the court of appeals have

16

agreed with the single position that district courts are

17

not free to substitute their own ratios for the 100 to 1

18

ratio, Congress would not have had a great deal of

19

reason to intervene in this area.

20

And what this case will tell Congress and

sentencing courts is within an advisory guidelines

regime, can Congress make certain policy judgments and

place certain limits on what a district court can do

that it otherwise would have freedom to do in an

doesn't that come up against the same Sixth Amendment

MR. DREEBEN:

And why

The only requirement, I

believe, that exists under Booker is that judge not in

the guidelines range that would be based on the jury

I don't think they do have to

follow it through exactly the way the Sentencing

courts today which are sentencing under advisory

in our system, the policy judgments ultimately

pertaining to sentencing belong to Congress.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So there is really an

entirely different rationale for defending these

guidelines than any other guidelines in the system?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

And

Well, there are some other

19

guidelines where Congress has directly intervened, but

20

my fundamental point here is that so long as Congress

21

has made a determination that it has not changed, that

22

it wants 100 to 1 as a mandatory minimum set point,

23

district courts should not be free to say I think

24

Congress got it wrong, I'm going to sentence on a

25

different paradigm.

The Commission didn't think that
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was appropriate when it promulgated the original drug

2

guideline, which is why that guideline is not based on

3

the same sorts of empirical data that other guidelines

4

might be deemed to be responsive to.

5

reflected that the Commission in its original guideline

6

respected that its role was to carry out congressional

7

policy, not to disagree with or supplant congressional

8

policy, and so long as the Commission was operating in

9

that vein -- which I think was correct -- it follows a

But that only

10

fortiori that sentencing courts should do the same

11

thing.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does the Guidelines

13

supersede the parsimony provision, because the parsimony

14

provision is general and the Guidelines -- the ratio is

15

specific?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I would put it

17

differently, Justice Kennedy.

I would say that Congress

18

has made a legislative judgment that for crack purposes,

19

this ratio is what is needed to have a sufficient

20

sentence, and the Congress that decided that might be

21

wrong.

22

change that, a new policy will be established, but I

23

think that reading the two statutes together, Section

24

3553(a) and Section 841, produces the conclusion that

25

this is a legislative judgment of reasonableness; and

And if the present-day Congress decides to

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

even if every judge in the Federal system holds a

2

different personal view, that doesn't mean that the

3

statute has validated their position over the one that

4

Congress expressed in Title 21, in a manner that binds

5

sentencing courts irrespective of how the Commission

6

sorts out its policy judgments.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose experience shows

8

that the ratio is not consistent with the parsimony

9

provision -- we find that over a course of time?

10

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I don't think that the

11

Court can interpret Congress in Section 3553(a) to make

12

unreasonable what Congress did in Section 841.

13

reading all of the statutes together would produce the

14

conclusion that Congress deemed that this was the way to

15

achieve the purposes of sentencing.

16

I think

Crack is more corrosive in the inner cities.

17

It has different kinds of problems than powder.

18

should be addressed in this more severe sentencing

19

manner, and if that's a policy judgment that warrants

20

being revisited, the appropriate body to do it is

21

Congress, not each individual sentencing judge,

22

formulating his or her own ratio, subject to blanket

23

affirmance by the court of appeals.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY MICHAEL S. NACHMANOFF

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6
7

MR. NACHMANOFF:
Justice.

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Chief

If I can respond, Justice Stevens, I think
-- you asked about the percentage of cases in crack that

10

are at the mandatory minimum or near it.

11

the Court to page 33, footnote 10 of our opening brief.

12

It is approximately 70 percent or just over that that

13

hit at the mandatory minimum or just one or two levels

14

above that.

15

I would point

So the large majority of cases involving

16

crack cocaine end up being subjected to the mandatory

17

minimum.

18

With regard to the Government's argument

19

regarding Section 994(a) and the fact that direction was

20

given to the Commission to be consistent with pertinent

21

statutes, of course, that's reflected in Section 5(g)

22

which says that mandatory minimums trump the Guidelines,

23

and the Commission recognizes that and of course

24

sentencing judges recognize that, and Judge Jackson

25

recognized it here.
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

To suggest that Judge Jackson concluded that

2

Congress was crazy, I think is unfair.

3

Jackson did was, in a very reasoned opinion, explained

4

that the information from the Sentencing Commission,

5

which has been persuasive not just to Judge Jackson, but

6

to judges across the country and to many others, was

7

that the 100 to 1 ratio overstates the seriousness of

8

the offense, and he understood that Congress had spoken

9

clearly with regard to mandatory minimums, and he

10
11

What Judge

honored them.
Finally, Mr. Chief Justice, you point out

12

the heart of the problem with the Government's case.

13

Congress has not spoken explicitly in the way the

14

Government suggests.

15
16
17

They are -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I was wrong that

they legislated after Booker.
MR. NACHMANOFF:

Well, Your Honor, Congress

18

has failed completely to address this particular

19

problem, and they have understood since Booker that if

20

they wanted to address the issue of the discretion that

21

sentencing courts must have with regard to the advisory

22

guidelines, they have a way of fixing the problem.

23

can change the statute.

24

require the Government to include in the indictment and

25

prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt the specific

They

And so long as they then

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

drug type and drug quantity over and above the current

2

mandatory minimum and maximums, they're free to do that,

3

and there would no Sixth Amendment problem and there

4

would no problem with the advisory guidelines.

5

In other words, right now, the Government

6

simply alleges that a person engaged in the distribution

7

of either 5 grams or 50 grams of crack cocaine -- that's

8

what they have to do to meet the thresholds for the

9

5-year and the 10-year mandatory minimums -- in

10

virtually every case the Government will present

11

evidence or a court will find under relevant conduct

12

that there was some greater quantity.

13

Government's theory were to be accepted, those

14

guidelines would be mandatory, and it would be in direct

15

conflict with the remedial holding in Booker to require

16

courts to adhere to that, absent the procedural

17

protections which are not currently in place.

18

And if the

Judge Jackson did it right in this case.

He

19

imposed a sentence consistent with the parsimony

20

provision and the purposes of sentencing and all of the

21

factors in 3553(a).

22

He imposed a long sentence, 15 years, but he

23

honored Congress's explicit mandate, and we would ask

24

the Court to reverse the court of appeals and affirm the

25

district court.
