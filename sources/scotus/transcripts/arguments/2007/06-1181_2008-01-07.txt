Mr. Meade.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear argument

MR. MEADE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Congress has provided that certain aliens,

11

including those with good moral character, are eligible

12

for voluntary departure.

13

that all aliens may file one motion to reopen raising

14

new facts within 90 days.

15

Congress has also provided

The question is how to reconcile these two

16

provisions.

17

First, the Government agrees that the statute can be

18

read to preserve motions to reopen for voluntary

19

departure recipients.

20

that such aliens can file a motion to reopen; and if the

21

immigration official happens to act quickly enough, the

22

alien will receive a ruling.

23

Government's view, if the official does not act quickly

24

enough, the alien is denied an adjudication.

25

The parties agree on two key points:

Second, the Government agrees

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, under the

Can we consider that in

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

your case, given that the application to reopen was made

2

when there were only two days left to run for the

3

termination of the voluntary departure time --

4

words, it was your delay, not the Government's, that

5

made it impossible to decide this in the requisite time?

6

MR. MEADE:

in other

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and I

7

have two responses, one relating to this particular case

8

as well as the cases in general.

9

But, as to this particular case, Mr. Dada

10

found new counsel, which took a week; and in the

11

remaining time he prepared a motion to reopen with 80

12

pages of exhibits including affidavits, five letters,

13

medical documents, financial records including tax

14

returns.

15

two-and-a-half weeks to do the motion to reopen.

16

And that's why it took an additional

But, as a general matter, aliens file at

17

different periods during the period.

For example, in

18

the Eleventh Circuit case of Ugokwe the alien filed with

19

30 days left in the period, and the Government, the

20

agency, didn't act in time.

21

But what happens in the agency is that

22

motions to reopen are, in fact, decided relatively

23

quickly -- just not quickly enough.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
are -- are granted?
4
Alderson Reporting Company

How many of those

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. MEADE:

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

How many What percentage of

motions to reopen are granted in favor of the alien?

4

MR. MEADE:

We've looked for that statistic,

5

and we have not been able to find the statistic.

6

However, there are numerous cases presenting very

7

sympathetic facts which show grants of motions to

8

reopen.

9
10
11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So how many -- do

you know how many are filed on an annual basis?
MR. MEADE:

Yes, I do.

As a general matter,

12

there are 10,000 motions to reopen filed, but that's for

13

all aliens, for all removal proceedings.

14

voluntary departure is roughly 10 percent of all

15

removals, we estimate that'S roughly a thousand motions

16

to reopen filed by voluntary departure recipients.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Since

So there would be no

18

reason not to file one of these if you were subject to

19

voluntary -- if you elected voluntary departure, and it

20

extended your time to stay, right?

21

would file one of these if we rule in your favor.

22

MR. MEADE:

Seemingly, everybody

Not necessarily.

There are -

23

the statute governs when a motion to reopen is proper,

24

and the Attorney General determined, even under the

25

previous statutory scheme 5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We're dealing with

2

people who have already broken the law.

3

saying they are likely to follow the statute that says

4

only file a motion to reopen under these circumstances?

5

MR. MEADE:

So you're

Well, two responses:

First,

6

there are sanctions for frivolous filing under the

7

immigration proceedings.

8
9

Second, the Attorney General, under the old
regime that wasn't tightened -- the Attorney General

10

concluded that there was no pattern of abuse of motions

11

to reopen.

12
13
14

And, third, going forward, this is not a
risk because JUSTICE ALITO:

If an alien has not been

15

diligently pursuing his or her rights, you would argue

16

the person was still entitled to equitable tolling if

17

the alien files a motion to reopen?

18
19
20

MR. MEADE:

When you say that they're not

diligently pursuing their rights, I am not clear JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't that generally a

21

requirement for equitable tolling:

22

been diligently pursuing his rights?

23

MR. MEADE:

JUSTICE ALITO:

A person has to have

Generally, yes.
But you don't advocate the

You say if you file a petition

-- a motion to reopen, you get automatic equitable

2

tolling.

3

MR. MEADE:

Yes.

Not necessarily equitable

4

tolling, but, yes, automatic tolling under the statute.

5

But to show quickly -

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why isn't -- why isn't it

7

fair to say:

8

to leave the country if you've left in voluntary

9

departure.

10
11

You have the short time frame by statute

Yet, the Government has provided reopening

for all aliens.

Okay.

Why isn't it reasonable to say that, by

12

asking for reopening when you've gotten permission to

13

voluntarily depart within "x" days, you are

14

relinquishing your voluntary departure status?

15

MR. MEADE:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17
18

That Isn't that a perfect

reconciliation of the two?
MR. MEADE:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

That's

19

the option that the Government is proposing

prospectively.

21

requested at every stage of the proceedings before the

22

Board, before the Fifth Circuit, and the cert petition,

23

and in our opening brief.

24

the two statutory provisions which the Government is

25

proposing on an ongoing basis that will not apply to our

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you raised the

3

question, as I remember, when you put it in the cert

petition.

5

that question and limiting it to the question of having

6

it -- having it both ways, keeping your voluntary

7

departure and moving to reopen.

8
9

The Government advised against granting on

MR. MEADE:

Yes, that's correct, Justice

Ginsburg.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, another way

11

to reconcile the two that I think would be beneficial to

12

your client, but I'm not sure it's open to us, is to

13

address the Government's view that, when you voluntarily

14

depart, your motion to reopen is automatically

15

withdrawn.

16

regulation and not the statute.

17

That is, as I gather, set forth only in a

Now, it seems to me that if I were -- if I

18

thought it important to reconcile the two, I would be

19

much more concerned about that interpretation -- that

20

the motion to reopen is automatically withdrawn -- than

21

I would suggest we start incorporating equitable tolling

22

rules and all of that.

23
24
25

But, I take it, the vulnerability of that
regulation is probably beyond -- beyond debate.
MR. MEADE:

Well, that regulation is subject

That would be another way to solve the
It would be -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it wasn't directly

challenged here, was it?

5

MR. MEADE:

Excuse me?

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That regulation was not

7

directly challenged in this case?

8

MR. MEADE:

9
10

It was not directly challenged

because the Fifth Circuit is one of the circuits that
says that the motion -- that regulation is valid.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if we don't

12

address it here, there's going to be another case in a

13

year or 18 months where that's going to be raised?

14

MR. MEADE:

Your Honor, as to voluntary

15

departure recipients, this Court can construe the

16

statute to avoid the conflict here.

17

forward, the Government has a proposed solution which,

18

if adopted, will resolve the question on an ongoing

19

basis.

20

And, moving

Some of the examples of the facts that arise

21

in motions to reopen are seen in various cases.

22

23

disabilities as in the Azarte case in the Ninth Circuit,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, in all these

2

cases, if you think you have a good case on the motion

With respect, that's not an
Our client tried to do that, but

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, I mean he -- you

should not elect voluntary departure in the first place.
MR. MEADE:

Well, the problem is because of

13

the very nature of the motion to reopen.

14

reopen, by its very nature, is based on changed

15

circumstances, circumstances that were not available at

16

the original time of the hearing.

17

A motion to

So a person could enter and accept voluntary

18

departure at the time of the hearing and, because of

The agency didn't ask -- didn't answer that in the first

instance.

25

throughout the entire litigation, and now there is some

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So all we have on the

3

record is just an IJ's determination that he would not

4

accept it?

5

MR. MEADE:

Well, it wasn't the IJ.

It was

6

before the Board.

7

the Board's order only said he is ineligible for this

8

relief because he has overstayed the voluntary departure

9

period.

10

It was presented to the Board, and

But there is some irony JUSTICE SOUTER:

But at the time he filed,

11

he had not overstayed, because he filed on Friday

12

afternoon, right?

13

MR. MEADE:

Yes.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So -- so maybe the point is

15

we didn't have time to rule on it simply because he

16

filed it on Friday afternoon and he had to leave on

17

Sunday, and therefore, we should not take that as a

18

determination that had he filed in time for timely

19

action by the court he would have been denied.

20

MR. MEADE:

The agency has never given a

21

reason for why they did not accept the withdrawal,

22

although there is some irony in the fact that the

23

proposed solution going forward would give aliens

24

exactly what my client asked for if the agency -

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the voluntary withdrawal
12

Alderson Reporting Company

1

had been withdrawn successfully, he would then have been

2

subject to the alternate order of removal?

3

MR. MEADE:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

That's correct, Your Honor.
And he could have been

removed immediately?

6

MR. MEADE:

That's correct.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that would have mooted

8

the motion to reopen, wouldn't it?

9

MR. MEADE:

It wouldn't have mooted the

10

motion to reopen.

11

all aliens subject to a final order, including criminal

12

aliens, including some accused of terrorism.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that's the choice he made when he accepted voluntary

2

departure.

3

MR. MEADE:

One final response is that in

4

the government's proposed regulation, an alien is

5

permitted to file a motion to reopen notwithstanding

6

having been granted voluntary departure, which indicates

7

that the government itself does not think that the

8

bargain includes -- or that Congress did not intend the

9

bargain to include a waiver of the one motion to reopen

10

which all aliens are entitled to file.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Going back to the

12

question that Justice Alito put to you, that he would

13

then be, and you agree this is what you asked for first,

14

like any other removable alien.

15

you:

16

that not so?

17

you can move for a stay of removal when you have a

18

reopening pending.

19

And Justice Alito asked

Well, then he could be removed immediately, is
My understanding was, yes, that's so, but

Is that true?

MR. MEADE:

Yes.

If you have a final order

20

of removal, yes, you can file for a stay once you have a

21

final order.

22

Because he's under the voluntary departure grant, he

23

cannot get the same ability for a stay that those who

24

are subject to a final removal.

25

So my client is in a worse position.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the irony is -

If you say that tolling is

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

automatic, which I assume is your position, would it be

2

possible under the statutes to say that tolling is not

3

automatic but can be permitted in the discretion of the

4

hearing officer?

5

MR. MEADE:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

10

Or are we then just

inventing something that's not in the statute at all?

8
9

I -

MR. MEADE:

Well, the problem, Justice

Kennedy, is that the agency would need to act within the
short time period.

11

And -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No.

All it needs to do is

12

to say, we'll grant you an extension while we look at

13

this.

14

MR. MEADE:

That's true, Justice Kennedy.

15

But that's essentially the same action that would be

16

needed to decide the motion to reopen in the first

17

place.

18

the same Board member that had decided the original

19

appeal.

20

agency to be able to decide these, as is reflected by

21

the general time periods for adjudication.

22

Motions to reopen are discretionary.

They go to

So it does not take much time or effort for the

For example, in the Dekoladeno case on the

voluntary departure they don't have to address it.

motions to reopen.

5

anybody -- why everybody wouldn't file one, because it

6

extends their stay.

7

I

As I said, I don't see know why

MR. MEADE:

It's a discretionary

8

determination to the single Board member.

And the Board

9

member could deny the motion to reopen, even when

10

there's a prima facie case.

11

to see if it -- in the subset of cases that the agency,

12

exercising its own discretion, where they agree that a

motion to reopen is proper.

But for the most part -

JUSTICE BREYER:

What I'm

wondering here, and this is because I see two contrary

things, if for to you win it means that you are adding

12

an average of, say, 400 days to a stay where Congress

13

said we want you to stay no more than 60 days or 120?

14

That's pretty hard for me to reconcile, to tell you the

15

truth.

16

MR. MEADE:

Well, one of the answers on that

17

question on the petition for review front is exactly

18

what the government has proposed in its rule going

19

forward, which is that an alien who has voluntary

20

departure can file a petition for review, but by doing

21

so the voluntary departure grant terminates and they're

22

in the same position as other aliens, on the same level

23

playing as other aliens.

24

proposed by the government going forward, and as to the

25

petition for review hypothetical that would also apply.

That's the solution being

That would just put my client in the same position as

6

decided and also the appeal process has run?

7
8

Are you asking for automatic tolling just until the

MR. MEADE:

Just for the motion, just for

the time that the motion to reopen is decided.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's what I thought.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well then, that's the

11

answer to my question.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But in your discussion with

13

Justice Breyer you seemed to be saying that he can hang

14

around right through the appeal.

15
16

MR. MEADE:

Thank you for the correction,

Justice Scalia.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, is your

18

position that the right to appeal is taken away, just as

19

under the current regime the motion to reopen is taken

20

away?

21

MR. MEADE:

No, Chief Justice Roberts.

The

22

difference is that petitions for review can be

23

adjudicated from outside the country, so whether the

24

alien is here or abroad he can get an adjudication of

25

his motion -- of his petition for review, and that was a
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

change under the 1996 act.

2

The problem for motions to reopen is that an

3

alien cannot receive an adjudication at all.

4

stay.

He can't go.

5

He can't

There's no way for those new facts.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's by regulation,

6

though, that he can't, he cannot pursue that from out of

7

the country.

8
9

MR. MEADE:

Yes, that's true.

That is

not -- that is by regulation, although that regulation

10

applies to all motions to reopen, not just for the

11

subset of motions to reopen or voluntary departure

12

recipients.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If your client or some

14

other client, assuming the government wins in this case,

15

leaves within the 60-day period and the petition for

16

rehearing is forwarded, can he take all these affidavits

17

and apply for an adjustment of status, or is that much

18

longer?

19

MR. MEADE:

No.

The problem is that for an

20

alien, for many aliens covered by voluntary departure,

21

once they leave the country they are subject to various

22

unlawful presence bars.

23

bars are triggered and they cannot get the same relief

24

from outside the country.

25

So by leaving the country these

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Even with voluntary

21
Alderson Reporting Company

2

departure?
MR. MEADE:

Even with voluntary departure.

3

Leaving the country triggers these bars.

4

outside the country you cannot reapply for admission for

5

in some cases up to 10 years, and that precludes the

6

ability to leave the country and seek the relief, even

7

if you have a marriage to a United States citizen, even

8

if there are extreme circumstances in a particular case

9

that need to be addressed and that would be addressed

10
11

Once you're

under a motion to reopen.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you have to argue

12

that the -- my understanding is that once the -- let's

13

say it's the government's proposed regulation and the

14

motion for -- or the voluntary departure is withdrawn to

15

enable you to consider the motion to reopen.

16

proceed with deportation at that time, correct?

17

MR. MEADE:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They can

Absolutely.
So you -- you almost

19

have to be arguing that the motion to reopen tolls the

20

time for deportation as well, right?

21

MR. MEADE:

No.

We just want -- under the,

22

under the question -- under the government's proposed

23

rule or under the -

voluntary departure period there is no final order in

7

So yes, it would toll the time for leaving the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other words, the

8

government cannot enter a deportation order during a

9

voluntary departure period.

10

MR. MEADE:

Yes.

That's governed by the

11

agency's own regulations that say that there's no -- the

12

ultimate order of deportation does not go into effect

13

until an overstay of a voluntary departure period.

14

One thing that is -

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So I'm not following this.

16

I thought the assumption was we're going to be using the

17

government's new proposed system, in which the

18

acceptance of voluntary departure is eliminated when you

19

file a reopening petition, right.

20

then proceed to deport you involuntarily or is that also

21

going to be stayed until, until completion of the

22

reopening petition?

23

MR. MEADE:

So can the government

I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.

24

You're absolutely right.

I was addressing the tolling

25

construction with Mr. Chief Justice.
23
Alderson Reporting Company

But as to the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

government's proposed rule under the proposed rule and

2

what my client asks for, the time -- the alien would be

3

automatically subject to a final order and could be

4

deported involuntarily so long as the alien did not get

5

and obtain a stay of deportation from the agency or the

6

court, so yes.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that, that involuntary

8

deportation would effectively cancel the, the petition

9

for reopening, right?

10

MR. MEADE:

If the agency acted quickly

11

enough and involuntarily deported someone within that

12

time -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why are you willing to

14

leave the involuntary deportees in that position,

15

whereas you're not willing to leave the voluntary

16

deportees in that position, that their reopening

17

petition just vanishes?

18

involuntary deportees than for the voluntary?

19

it's probably fairer for the voluntary because they made

20

their choice.

MR. MEADE:

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

Thank you,

The filing of a motion to reopen does not
automatically suspend the obligation of an alien to

10

leave the United States within the time that was

11

specified in the Board's order granting permission to

12

depart voluntarily.

13

reflects an exchange of benefits between the government

14

and the alien and Petitioner's automatic tolling rule

answer to that.

23

24

voluntary departure your reopening is dead; you have to

choose between asking for reopening or voluntary

But that's not the quid pro quo you're

2

saying that the government is adopting.

3

quo is if you accept voluntary departure you roll the

dice as to whether your reopening petition will be

decided in time.

you just have to hope that it will be decided before you

get deported.

It isn't dead.

14

denied because he was not eligible for the underlying

substantive relief that he requested in this motion.

16

Overstaying a voluntary departure period does not, for

example, bar an alien from obtaining asylum or

18

withholding of removal on a motion to reopen.

19

the particular substantive form of relief that he

20

requested in his motion to reopen that is at issue, and

21

that was denied.

22

Petitioner's motion to reopen was not

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, that may be.

It was

But

23

Congress passed a statute that grants a statutory right

24

to file a motion to reopen no matter what the relief is.

25

And the thing that seems strange to me, I guess to carry
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Scalia's question one step further, is what

2

seems strange to me is that Congress would have granted

3

that right in effect across the board, regardless of

4

what the reason for the reopening might be and yet would

5

have done so knowing that the, that the time for

6

adjudication before the IJ is likely to take longer than

7

the period of the, prior to the moment of required

8

departure.

9

would be -- would have been giving a right to reopen

10

that in practical terms in most cases will avail the

11

alien absolutely nothing because he'll have to get out

12

before there can be an adjudication.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

14

It sounds as though Congress on your view

With all respect, that's not

correct.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

Why?
Again, both prior to 1996 and

17

after 1996 Congress specified that an alien who

18

overstays the voluntary departure period is ineligible

19

for three forms of discretionary relief.

20

voluntary departure, cancellation or removal, or

21

adjustment of status.

22

afterhand.

23

limitation on the time for either a motion to reopen or

24

voluntary departure.

25

abuses on both of those fronts, and what it did in 1996

Now it's

That was true both beforehand and

Before 1996, there was no statutory

Congress was concerned about

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was to compress the voluntary departure time for 60 days

2

because it was concerned about how long the agency was

3

allowing agents -- aliens to remain in the country under

4

orders of voluntary departure.

5

respect to motions to reopen was very modest.

6

put in statutory form a limitation that the agency had

7

put in place pursuant to a statutory directive to place

8

time and number limitations on motions to reopen because

9

of Congress's concern about abuse.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And what it did with
It just

Okay, but isn't the

11

question in this case whether what Congress did was as

12

modest as you say?

13

say, then in at least a substantial category of cases in

14

which a motion to reopen will be filed, it will in fact

15

be no time in the real world to act on that motion

16

before the voluntary departure date.

17

is did Congress really intend a right to reopen that is

18

as modest as that.

Because if it is as modest as you

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

21
22

And the question

Well And it seems strange that

it would have.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Two responses to that.

With

23

respect to the voluntary departure, Congress anticipated

24

that the alien was going to leave under the order of

25

voluntary departure, not remain here.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

And prior to

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

1996, just to -

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it was -- was the

3

regulation -- was the current regulation in place at the

4

time of the '96 Act, that the -- that the departure of

5

the alien, whatever the term is, waives the motion to -

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

That regulation has been a

7

fundamental part of motions to reopen going back at

8

least until the 1960s.

9
10
11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So, we assume that Congress

knew that.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

Yes, we do have.

And

12

that's part of the arrangement.

13

that regulation was repromulgated as part of General

14

Motion to Reopen Regulation in 1995.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The only thing -- and

Okay, then Congress knew at

16

the time of the '96 Act that, if in fact the motion to

17

reopen was filed in the normal course, it probably

18

couldn't be heard prior to the date at which (a) the

19

alien either will overstay and be in trouble for that or

20

(b) will have departed and, under the existing

21

regulatory regime, have forfeited his right to reopen.

22

And it's the strangeness that Congress would want -

23

would have wanted to extend the right to reopen to a

24

statutory level under these circumstances unless it

25

contemplated some kind of a tolling scheme that would
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

avoid this sort of Kafka-esque result.

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

Again, if I may, the -

3

what Congress had in mind with the deal of granting

4

voluntary departure was it greatly constricted the time

5

to leave.

6

don't leave in 60 days, you're not going to get

7

voluntary departure adjustment of status or cancellation

8

or removal.

9

substantive relief that an alien might file for in a

You have to leave in 60 days, and if you

It didn't affect the eligibility for other

10

motion to reopen, such as asylum, such as if he has new

11

evidence going to the ground of removal.

12

was particularly concerned not to allow these three

13

forms of discretionary relief to remain available.

14

so I think Congress necessarily would have been

15

unconcerned about whether, if an alien did file a motion

16

to reopen within that greatly constricted 60-day period

17

-- in fact, in this case the Board gave 30 days -

18

Congress wasn't concerned about preserving the

19

underlying substantive eligibility for those forms of

20

discretionary relief, because it made that part of the

21

deal, that alien was giving up if he left -- if he

22

didn't leave the country, he was giving up that.

23

were lesser order forms of relief that Congress was

24

making available, but it did did not take away, for

25

example, the right to apply for asylum or withholding.

MR. KNEEDLER:

But the Court rewrote the

question presented so as not to -- not to address that,

no regulation that prohibits it, but the order is a

to depart voluntarily within 30 days; if you do not, the

the country before they have to, and if you appeal from

MR. KNEEDLER:

If you appeal to the Board of

Immigration Appeals, a motion to reopen arises only

10

after the Board has issued a final order on your appeal.

11

So if you appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, if

the Board rejects your claim on the merit, and

reinstates the voluntary departure period to allow you

to enter again -

an appeal to the -- to the BIA.

appeal goes to the Board -- this case involves motions

to reopen filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals,

He had no other substantive grounds of

motion to reconsider the denial of the motion to reopen,

22

and if you had an automatic tolling rule, it would -- it

23

would last as long as it took the Board to act on the

24

motion to reopen, which is -- which 60, 90, 120 days.

25

In this past Fiscal Year the Board on motions to reopen

I suppose the alien could file a

resolved I think only about 55 percent of those within

2

90 days.

3

talking -- and so we are talking about the very kind of

4

abuse of the immigration system that this Court was

5

concerned about -

6

The Board has a huge backlog, and we're

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

May I ask one question?

7

And I'm not sure the progression in which Justice Breyer

8

was going to begin.

9

has -- shows new evidence, new factors, new

I take it that the motion to reopen

10

circumstances; and that would be unavailable on the

11

appeal, because the record hasn't been supplemented.

12

am I wrong about that?

13
14
15
16

MR. KNEEDLER:

That -- that's true.

It has

-JUSTICE KENNEDY:

While you have an appeal

-- while you have an appeal from what was in the record.

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right, although If you don't have the

19

motion to reopen then the -- then the new material is

20

not subject to the appeal, or am I wrong?

21

Or

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

It's not subject to the

22

appeal as such but the Board procedures take account of

23

developments that happen while the case is on appeal,

24

which is that you can file with the Board while your

25

appeal is pending and ask for a motion to remand on the
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ground that new evidence has come up.

For example, in

2

the case of adjustment of status, where -- the alien's

3

wife has filed a petition for immediate relative status

4

to let the alien get a visa, if while the case is

5

pending on appeal that petition has been granted, then

6

-- then it would -- then all the alien has to do is file

7

a motion with the Board and say there is new

8

information; please remand it back to the immigration

9

judge.

So a lot of times what has happened is -- maybe

10

intervening things have happened but the alien doesn't

11

do anything about it during the year that the appeal is

12

pending with the Board of Immigration Appeals; then

13

there is a final order and the alien rushes in with the

14

-- with the new information at that point, where if you

15

had only brought it to the attention of the Board while

16

the appeal was pending, it could have been remanded.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

So your basic is -- don't

18

tell me if I'm right if I'm wrong, please.

19

the -- what I'm thinking your basic problem or position

20

is and why you've got into this, is because you think

21

any really meritorious case where there should be

22

reopening will be pointed out to the Board before there

23

is a final order in effect and before voluntary

24

departure becomes an issue?

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

That -- that 41

Alderson Reporting Company

The -

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

And if we decide against

2

you, then you're thinking, well, what will happen in

3

every case is after there is a final order, the alien

4

will move for a motion to reopen because he will get a

5

few extra days.

6
7

MR. KNEEDLER:

It's more than a few extra

days.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

10

It's an automatic tolling

period.

11
12

He gets a -- several -

JUSTICE BREYER:

Have I got it right, what

your point is?

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

That is correct and I

14

-- and I think it's fair to say if you're talking about

15

changed circumstances or new evidence that arises after

16

the IJ has rendered his decision, that's a period that

17

might be a year; it might be a year and a half.

18

developments or changed circumstances are far more

19

likely to have happened during that period of time than

20

they would during a 30-day period of voluntary departure

21

that -- that the Board reinstates at the conclusion of

22

the appeal.

23

New

So an alien in this position who has been

24

granted voluntary departure and knows that a motion to

25

reopen may not be a realistic option, if he wants to
42
Alderson Reporting Company

seek adjustment of status or cancellation of removal,

2

the solution to that is to be alert and attentive and

3

file something with the Board, if there are in fact -

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why isn't the solution to

withdraw, relinquish the voluntary departure?
MR. KNEEDLER:

That would be -- that would

7

be one -- as the Attorney General said in his proposed

8

regulations, that would be one way to administer the

9

program, but the Act does not compel that.

10

The Act does

not compel -

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13
14
15
16
17

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

If you do that, the

The alien is still

subject to deportation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

With the provision that

he can get a stay.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, he could get -- he could

18

get a stay of removal, and the same -- same thing is

19

true here, if the -- if the alien remains in the

20

country, his voluntary departure period expires, he

21

could file for a stay of removal with the Board or he

22

could file for a stay of removal with the court of

23

appeals if he wants to file a petition.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But then because he would

then be back -- if he stays here after the period is
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

run, then he has relinquished the voluntary departure.

2

He is like any removable -

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

Right.

But -- but

4

like any person, he could file a motion for a stay with

5

the court of appeals to prevent his deportation.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But not to stay -- but he

7

would not be hanging on to his voluntary departure.

8

That's gone.

9
10

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, that -- that is correct.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is there any reason he

11

could not unilaterally relinquish the voluntary

12

departure status as distinct from having to get approval

13

from the Board or bureaucrat?

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, as I say, the way that

15

-- the Board's order grants him permission to voluntary

16

depart and says the following consequences will attach

17

if you do not.

18

to withdraw.

19
20
21
22

Nothing in the Board's order allows him
It grants him that permission.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

it doesn't address the issue, and my question is MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I think it probably

forecloses it.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

24

MR. KNEEDLER:

25

Well, I know it doesn't -

Why?
Because it's the -- it's the

content of the Board's order that -- that says you have
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

60 days to depart and if you do not, the following

2

consequences attach.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but the Board is

saying, look, I'm granting your request -- we are

5

granting your request for a voluntary departure status

6

and there are certain consequences that that status

7

carries.

Why are conditions that attach when he has

11

Board?

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

I -- I -- the statute and

13

regulations just don't provide for it.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, if they don't provide

15

for it, and they don't say you can't do it, why isn't it

16

arbitrary not to let him do it?

17

it's -- if it's arbitrary -

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

I mean -- what -- if

He -- he requested it at the

19

outset.

The case has proceeded on the sense that that

20

is -- that that is the arrangement, that -- that the

21

reciprocal benefits and burdens that the Government and

22

the alien have undertaken -

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

It sounds almost arbitrary

24

to say to a person, look, if you think you have some new

25

evidence and want to reopen, do it.

adjustment.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

I'm not standing here

10

defending the contrary position as an overarching policy

matter, because after all the Attorney General's

12

proposed regulations provide for that.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

My -

So why not apply them to

this person?

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

As they are now drafted they

16

would apply prospectively.

17

voluntary departure and motions to reopen are

18

administered under the statute and the regulations and

19

the BIA orders that are entered under the current

20

regulatory framework, which has a different sort of deal

21

between the alien and the government in mind, and that

22

--

23

But my only point is that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Which you say -- you say

24

that under the current regime, the voluntary departure

25

application, granted, is irrevocable.
46
Alderson Reporting Company

That's -

2

MR. KNEEDLER:
think essentially yes.

3

I think essentially -- I

I -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The regulations don't say

4

that.

The regulations are just blank.

5

and if you do this it's irrevocable.

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

It doesn't say

And I want to qualify

7

my answer in a further respect -- that regulations with

8

respect to voluntary departure being granted by the

9

Board don't say anything like that.

But I am informed

10

by the executive office of immigration review that if

11

the immigration judge grants voluntary departure and the

12

alien appeals to the Board, the ordinary course would be

13

for the Board to reinstate voluntary departure if it

14

rejects the alien's appeal.

15

requests that voluntary departure not be reinstated once

16

the Board's order is entered, then the Board will omit

17

that from its final order of removal.

18

But if on appeal the alien

19

appeal to the Board that the Board not reinstate a -

21

merits.

22

that the alien had requested voluntary departure,

23

entered an order on that assumption, and once it's

24

entered, it's a final order that would require some

25

amendment of the order, in order to -- in order to be

And so the Board went forward on the assumption

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

changed under the current regime.

2
3

JUSTICE GINSBERG:

But the order didn't say

he couldn't withdraw?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, it didn't.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what about this?

I'm

6

just trying this out.

You don't have to respond if you

7

don't want to.

8

here, really tried to reconcile the two interests that

9

we talked about in our prior conversation.

But you say, look, the AG in his rules

Now

10

hypothetically, I suppose you say that was a reasonable

11

way of going about this, and we remand for consideration

12

about whether this prior situation that you couldn't do

13

that was arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion, or

14

your failure to apply it retroactively to a certain

15

class of people was arbitrary, capricious, abusive

16

discretion?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think -- I think if the

18

Court wants to get into the question of whether he could

19

withdraw it, the proper thing for the Court to do would

20

be to reject the Petitioner's argument that there is an

21

automatic tolling rule, because that's fundamentally

22

inconsistent with Congress' deliberate intention to

23

impose a short deadline and not let the agency extend

24

that, but to remand to the Board of Immigration Appeals

25

for an explanation as to whether he could withdraw his
48
Alderson Reporting Company

request for voluntary departure.

2

I don't think the Court should decide that

question on its own.

4

the Board.

5

issues regulations that provide for withdrawal of the

6

request, maybe because his case would be back before the

7

Board, those new regulations could be applied.

8

whether that -- the alien should be allowed to do that

is fundamentally a question for the Attorney General in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Kneedler, do you

13

know what percentage of these motions to reopen are

14

granted?

15
16
17

MR. KNEEDLER:

I do not.

I asked that

question, and I do not know the answer to that.
I would like to come back to the fundamental

18

automatic tolling rule that -- the fundamental

19

inconsistency of that automatic tolling rule with what

20

Congress did in 1996, because it shortened to 60 days

21

the time limit in which an alien can depart.

22

It also eliminated a prior exception that

23

had been the law that allowed an exception to the

24

consequences for somebody who overstayed even the much

25

longer voluntary departure period for exceptional
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

circumstances.

2

Congress repealed that exception.

Prior to 1996, the Board in the case we cite

3

in our briefs called Matter of Shaar, held that if an

4

alien is granted voluntary departure and files a motion

5

to reopen, it rejected two arguments.

6

filing of a motion to reopen was itself exceptional

7

circumstances that eliminated the deadline.

8

that.

9

automatic tolling rule that Petitioner is arguing for

One is that the

It rejected

It also in an en banc decision rejected the

10

here under a situation in which Congress had granted a

11

long time for aliens to voluntarily depart.

12

We think it defies common sense to suggest

13

that when Congress compressed the time to 60 days, it

14

meant to at the same time reverse what the Board had

15

done in Matter of Shaar and granted an automatic tolling

16

rule, not even one under the control of the immigration

17

authorities, but an automatic tolling rule as a matter

18

of law simply by the unilateral act of filing a motion

19

to reopen.

20

And the Board in Matter of Shaar addressed

21

all of those things.

The Board of Immigration Appeals

22

has filed, followed Matter of Shaar, in the intervening

23

years since 1997 -- and importantly, I would like to

24

point this out, too, when Petitioner sought a motion for

25

reopening, he relied on a Board decision called
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Villarde, which recognized that in some circumstances an

2

alien may file a motion to reopen to try to get

3

adjustment of status if there has been intervening

4

development with respect to an immediate relative

5

petition filed by a spouse.

6

The Board adopted that rule in this en banc

7

published decision Villarde, but said one of the

8

qualifications for being eligible for that relief is

9

that you not be barred under Matter of Shaar, which

10

means you not be barred by having overstayed your

11

voluntary departure period.

12

So, in the very procedure that Petitioner

13

invoked in this case, there is a published Board

14

decision post-1997 that relies on that -- that relies on

15

that rationale, and the Board has followed that

16

consistently.

17

interpretation of the act for the Attorney General not

18

to allow the undermining of this tightened voluntary

19

departure system by providing for reopening.

20

It is at the very least a reasonable

I should also point out that this is not

21

tolling in the normal sense.

22

where a person has a claim and there is a statute of

23

limitations for filing a claim before a forum.

24
25

Tolling usually arises

Petitioner here was already granted
voluntary departure.

The 60-day time limit is not a
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

procedural statute of limitations.

It is a limitation

2

on substantive immigration relief.

And we think it's

3

particularly odd that the filing of a procedural motion

4

to reopen would have the effect of changing the

5

statutorily limited time in which an alien could

6

voluntarily depart the United States.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. MEADE

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. MEADE:

The government's arguments on

13

the statutory interpretation in this case are undermined

14

by its own proposed rule for at least five reasons.

15

First, their proposed rule makes clear that

16

the government agrees that the statute can be read to

17

have multiple meanings.

18

Second, the proposed rule makes clear that

19

Congress did not intend voluntary departure recipients

20

to waive the motion to reopen in accepting voluntary

21

departure.

22

Third, the rule stresses the importance of

23

motions to reopen and their importance in bringing

24

changed facts to the agency's attention.

25

Fourth, the proposed rule turns on
53
Alderson Reporting Company

1

unilateral action of the alien and permits that

2

unilateral action to terminate the voluntary departure

3

grant.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you agree with counsel

5

for the government as to how long it typically takes for

6

these motions to reopen to be disposed of?

7

something like 55 percent take, what, more than -

8
9

MR. MEADE:

He said

My understanding is that the

time, that the time is actually relatively short, that

10

they are generally decided within 90 days.

11

procedures passed by the -- by regulation which indicate

12

that they go to the same Board member.

actually, the time -

They're

There has been

And

Do you have any

17

estimate about how many more motions to reopen will have

18

to be considered if your client prevails in this case?

19

MR. MEADE:

I do not think that there will

20

be many additional motions to reopen, if that happens.

21

Certainly, if the government has a -- if the proposed

22

rule is adopted, the number of motions to reopen will

23

not be affected, because prospectively, the solution -

24

the problem will have been solved, and this case we'll

25

only be dealing with people in the pipeline, people who
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have already made decisions about whether to file a

2

motion to reopen or not.

3

So assuming that the government's proposed

4

rule is enacted in anything like its proposed form, then

5

there will be no problem going forward.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, I don't

7

understand that, because my -- as I understand it, it

8

would in every case grant an effective extension of the

9

time which you would have to depart if you had filed a

10

motion to reopen.

11

MR. MEADE:

No, that's not correct, with

12

respect.

13

alien would be placed in the same position as other

14

aliens and would be -- and there would be no additional

15

incentive to file a motion to reopen.

16

Under the government's proposed rule, the

Under the government's proposed rule, the

17

period would not toll, the voluntary departure grant

18

would expire, and the alien would be placed in the same

19

position as otherwise -

20
21
22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't it your position that

the statute requires tolling?
MR. MEADE:

Our interpretation is the

23

statute is subject to multiple interpretations.

24

one thing that the statute does not permit is the

25

solution, the construction that's being proposed by the
55
Alderson Reporting Company

But the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

government in this case.

2

would permit tolling.

3

the provisions as the government proposes going forward.

4

But the one thing that the statute does not permit is

5

the government's position in this particular litigation.

6

The government -- the statute

The statute permits reconciling

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You answered my

7

question with respect to the government's proposed

8

regulation.

9

the voluntary departure option to remain open, then

But under your position that would allow

10

anyone who exercised that option would want to file a

11

motion to reopen because it would extend their time?

12

MR. MEADE:

The motions to reopen are

13

subject to statutory and regulatory limits.

14

the time period -

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

MR. MEADE:

Moreover,

The answer is yes?

I'm saying that there -- aliens

17

could choose to do so, but I disagree that there would

18

be a -- many additional motions to reopen.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your answer is yes, but the

20

Attorney General's rule would prevent that -- proposed

21

rule would -

22
23
24
25

MR. MEADE:

Yes.

That's part of the answer,

yes, Justice Scalia.
But in addition, the length of time of
adjudication is entirely within the agency's control.
56

1

It can take two days, two weeks, two months, or if it

2

takes longer -

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Not if it has 10,000

4

of these a year, as you told me in your opening

5

argument.

6

You can't say all they have to do is decide them all

7

within two days.

8
9

I mean, it takes some time to address them.

MR. MEADE:

No.

But the answer is that

there -- it is within their control, so the length of

10

tolling under any tolling rule is not within the control

11

of the alien.

12

It's within the control of the agency.

This Court -- as to your question, Justice

13

Alito, on the -- with the regulations with respect to

14

withdraw in this case, the agency is silent on that.

15

It's unclear to me why the agency -- may I finish -

16

it's unclear why the agency did not give my client the

17

request he requested, and we ask that this Court either

18

grant tolling or interpret the statute consistent with

19

the government's proposed rule.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:07 p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
