ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE M. BECKER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. BECKER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

Both parts of the question presented in this

12

case should be answered "yes."

13

civil RICO claim based on fraud, someone must rely on

14

the alleged misrepresentation, and that someone must be

the plaintiff.

16

claim.

17

reason of a RICO violation, the predicate acts of which

18

involved a scheme or artifice to defraud.

19

For a treble damage

But that's the very nature of a fraud

Plaintiffs here claim that they were injured by

But no one in this case is arguing that a

20

civil RICO claim based on fraud can proceed without

21

someone relying.

22

question is who must rely?

23

natural answer is the plaintiff.

24
25

So some reliance is required; the only
And we submit that the

A plaintiff who hasn't relied to his
detriment on an alleged misrepresentation hasn't been

Alderson Reporting Company

1

defrauded; he hasn't been injured by reason of a scheme

2

to defraud.

3

relied on any misrepresentation; they haven't even

4

alleged that they received a misrepresentation.

5

Plaintiffs here haven't alleged that they

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So what about a case,

6

say, you've got organized crime wants to get rid of --

7

an organized crime enterprise wants to get rid of

8

rivals, so it makes misrepresentations about those

9

rivals to customers and suppliers, not to the -- to the

10

rival.

So there was no -- there is no misrepresentation

11

made to the plaintiff but to the plaintiff's customers

12

and suppliers.

13

So on your theory, is there no RICO claim

14

because the misrepresentation was made to someone other

15

than the plaintiff?

16

MR. BECKER:

Yes, that's correct, Justice

17

Ginsburg.

18

because, under the Neder case, we know that reliance,

19

justifiable reliance, and injury is not required.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20
21

24
25

But no civil case in

that -- in that situation?

22
23

There would be a criminal RICO prosecution

MR. BECKER:

That's correct, Justice

Ginsburg.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that doesn't even

comport with common-law civil cases.

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, for a long

3

old New York case that was discussed in the briefs that

4

I used to teach in contracts class, where he told

5

somebody that the horse was no longer for sale and it

6

was still for sale, and the person who wanted to sell

7

the horse at the higher price should have -- to buy the

8

horse should have had a cause of action, even though the

9

representation was not made to him.
MR. BECKER:

10

An

Justice Scalia, those cases as

11

well as the Rice versus Manley New York case, the cheese

12

buyer's case, similar situation, do exist, but they are

13

really tortious interference with business expectancy

14

cases.

And we believe that the law makes that clear.
When RICO was enacted in 1970, the law even

15
16

in New York, as we point out in our reply brief, had

17

evolved to the extent where -- where there were some

18

references to fraud in those early cases in the 19th

19

century.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose in a tortious

21

interference case, the two tort -- there are two tort

22

feasors, and they communicate with each other by mail.

23

Is that a violation of the mail fraud statute?

24
25

MR. BECKER:
mail fraud statutes.

It would be a violation of the

But I will say, Justice Kennedy,
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the government's position here seeks to extend the

2

mail fraud statute far beyond what this Court did in

3

Neder.

4

exact same argument in Neder as it did to this Court,

5

and the Court --

As a matter of fact, the government made the

In my -- in my

7

hypothetical, there was no -- there was no reliance on

9

scheme.

It was just used to facilitate the

And I assume the plaintiff could recover.
MR. BECKER:

10

I think that in criminal mail

11

fraud, reliance is not required, Justice Kennedy.

12

that's what the Neder Court held.

13

looked to the common law and imposed a materiality

14

requirement.

15

ruled that it's not required in criminal mail fraud is

16

because no one has to be injured; there does not have to

17

be a completed scheme.

18

And

But in doing so, it

And the only reason that the Neder case

Civil -- there is, of course, no private

19

right of action in mail fraud.

And when we look to

20

whether or not someone has a civil claim under RICO

21

through the predicate act of mail fraud, we have to go

22

through 1964(c), the "injured by reason of" requirement.

23

As this Court found in Holmes, the common-law

24

requirement of proximate cause applies, we submit so

25

does the common-law element of reliance, justifiable
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reliance, apply in a civil RICO case predicated on mail

2

fraud.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, isn't -- isn't the

4

difference that, in Holmes, it was the textual basis "by

5

reason of" through which the -- as we read it -- the

6

proximate cause standard was -- was brought into the

7

statute.

8

it seems to me, that you can -- can rely on.

9

Here, in fact, there -- there isn't any text,

The fact of fraud itself doesn't do it

10

because the statute speaks in terms of an offense for

11

which an individual should be prosecuted.

12

looking to the criminal rather than the civil model.

13

And isn't that the distinction, in effect, a textual

14

distinction, between Holmes as a means for importing

15

proximate cause and the statute in this case as a means

16

for importing first-party reliance?

17

MR. BECKER:

So it's

Well, Justice Souter, of

18

course, in Holmes the Court was looking at the "injured

19

by reason of" language and looked to the Clayton Act and

20

looked to the Sherman Act before it, where Congress used

21

precisely the same language.

22

have proximate cause in its text at all.

23

Certainly RICO doesn't

The reason -- the very reason that the

24

common law does apply when you are construing a mail

25

fraud predicate act through a civil RICO claim is
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

because Congress has not told us what "defraud" means.

2

It has not defined "scheme to defraud," and of course

3

that's --

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why hasn't it done so

5

simply or sufficiently done so by referring to the -- in

6

effect --

the criminal mail fraud violation?

7

MR. BECKER:

Because in other cases where

8

this Court has looked at the same type of situation, the

9

Neder case, Field versus Mans, for example, where there

10

is not a definition of a term such as fraud, the Court

11

has looked to the common law to define that term.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but we didn't have --

13

I don't think we had in those cases the phrase that

14

occurs here.

15

prosecuted or indicted" for something -- I think it was

16

prosecution -- which tends to narrow it down to the

17

criminal model, rather than allowing us to roam into the

18

civil field.

19

I think the phrase here is "could be

MR. BECKER:

Except, Justice Souter, that

20

the -- the requirement that there need to be an

21

indictable offense is not enough to make out a civil

22

fraud because criminal law recognizes a -- an

23

uncompleted fraud, simply a scheme, where here, if

24

you're talking about a completed fraud, for someone to

25

be injured by reason of a fraud, it has to be completed
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and someone has had to rely on it.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

Well, that means

3

that to that extent the criminal -- in effect -- the

4

criminal cause of action is narrowed down.

5

follow from that that the statute contemplated adopting

6

a civil model regardless.

7

MR. BECKER:

It doesn't

I -- we -- we believe it does.

8

If Your Honor will contrast the Salinas case with the

9

Beck versus Prupis case, we believe it's the similar -JUSTICE SOUTER:

10
11

You're going to have to

help me do that.

12

MR. BECKER:

All right.

I will.

In the

13

Salinas case, which was a criminal RICO case, the Court

14

ruled that it was not necessary to have a wrongful overt

15

act in order to make out a criminal cause of action for

16

conspiracy under the RICO statute.

17

because all you need is the agreement and any acts.

18

And the reason was

This was a situation where a sheriff

19

actually was the wrongdoer, but the deputy sheriff took

20

some innocent acts that were in furtherance of

21

conspiracy.

22

The Court said that's conspiracy.
However, in the Beck versus Prupis case, the

23

Court said that for civil RICO cause of action based on

24

conspiracy, you need to look at the combination between

25

1964(c), the "injured by reason of" language, and the
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

actual statutory language.

2

defined in the RICO statute, the Court looked to the

3

common law, and the common law requires that there needs

4

to be an unlawful overt act or tortious act in order to

5

make out a common-law cause of action for conspiracy.

6

And the Court ruled that that was necessary.

7
8

And since conspiracy is not

We think it's the exact same relationship
Salinas is to Beck as Neder is to this case.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, why -No, but -Why isn't it -- there is

12

reliance on their allegations by the county.

13

thinks that each bidder is putting in only one bid.

14

the county has been deceived, and the plaintiff suffers

15

the effect of that deception.

16

MR. BECKER:

The county

Why doesn't that qualify?

Because no representation has

17

been made to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff hasn't

18

relied on the misrepresentation that was made to the

19

county.

20

So

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But without the mail fraud

21

violation -- let's assume -- the tort would have been

22

unsuccessful.

23
24
25

It would not have been complete.

MR. BECKER:

Without the misrepresentation

to the county, Justice Kennedy?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Yes.

Let's assume

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that.

And it was directed at this class of persons and

2

it was relied upon by the county.

3

that's certainly sufficient under the -- it's a mail

4

fraud violation.

5

MR. BECKER:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me that

Well, I think this -I mean, refer to the mail

7

-- the civil RICO refers to whether it's a mail fraud

8

violation.

9

requirement.

You want to assume this additional reliance

MR. BECKER:

10

We think it's necessary, Your

11

Honor.

The other aspect, of course, in the hypothetical

12

is that there needs to be some direct injury, and we

13

don't believe that a direct injury is presented here.

14

In order to -- in Anza and, of course,

15

before in Holmes, the Court set forth three basic

16

guidelines in order to determine whether there was

17

sufficient proximate cause to bring a cause of action

18

under civil RICO, and in Anza under mail fraud.

19

don't think those three are enough in this kind of a

20

situation.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We

But isn't the problem with

22

your argument that if this isn't direct enough, there is

23

no injury at all?

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

guises, but the county isn't getting hurt.

2

it's not direct enough for -- for the Plaintiffs in this

3

case to sue, then nobody has a direct enough interest or

4

can show direct enough causation for RICO.

5

MR. BECKER:

So that if

disagree that the rotational allocation is well pled

8

last several pages and in footnote 7, the actual sale

9

and the bidding is nothing like the concept of

10

As we pointed out in our reply brief toward the

rotational allocations.

11

But putting that aside for a moment, the

12

county certainly could be a victim.

13

county -- this is a violation of an administrative rule.

14

That's what is at the heart of this case, an alleged

15

violation.

16

the purpose that Your Honor just articulated, although

17

there is nothing in the record to let us know that.

18

First of all, the

The county has made the rule possibly for

But what we do know is that these types of

19

rules exist for the benefit of the property owners, and

20

that's because the Illinois Supreme Court in -- the same

21

plaintiff brought a case challenging a very, very

22

similar rule.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But how could the property

24

owner be hurt if there is -- if we are dealing in a

25

situation here in -- in which the penalty is zero
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

percent, and everybody is bidding zero percent, then

2

this is a situation in which the property owner isn't

3

going to get hurt no matter who ends up with it.

4

MR. BECKER:

Justice Souter, zero percent is

5

by no means guaranteed.

That's only been the last three

6

years.

7

In fact, in the 2000 case before the Illinois

JUSTICE SOUTER:
that's the case here.

Yes, but that's the --

So if your direct-injury

10

requirement, as you construe it, applies here, I think

11

we are still left with a situation in which on these

12

facts, nobody would be injured, because nobody -- or

13

nobody would be -- be able to prove injury by a

14

sufficient direct route to establish causation.

15

MR. BECKER:

16

Plaintiffs, Your Honor.

Including the bidders and the

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

18

MR. BECKER:

Yeah.

Right.

Well, I think that they

19

certainly could not prove injury as a matter of proof.

20

The problem with that, of course, is in a RICO case it

21

takes five years to get there.

22

plead -- use two words with no elaboration at all,

23

"rotational allocation."

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And someone can artfully

Yes, but that's a

different point, the point that you made in your reply
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

brief, that maybe there isn't this rotational system,

2

and maybe they can't prove that they were -- that they

3

were injured; that they would have gotten a greater

4

share.

5

if you -- you have to accept the allegations of their

6

complaint as true, even if everything they say in the

7

complaint is true, they have no claim.

8

RICO claim.

But your case is about -- it doesn't matter even

9
10
11

MR. BECKER:

They have no

That's correct, Justice

Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So we have to assume what

12

they say about the rotational system is right and -- but

13

-- but you are hanging your hat on no misrepresentation

14

was made to them.

15

MR. BECKER:

That's correct, Justice.

We --

16

we are -- we have raised below, but not in this Court,

17

that there was not sufficient injury, directness of

18

injury; and it can't be proved in this Court.

19

it comes into play in the reliance concept under

20

proximate causation.

21

I think

And what we are asking the Court to do is to

22

recognize that, in the context of a civil RICO claim

23

based on fraud, that there is -- there is nothing that

24

is -- that is revolutionary about finding that a

25

reliance requirement should be applied.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

This case, as

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Court knows, was originally dismissed by Chief Judge

2

Holderman on that very basis.

3

If we have -- if we were to accept -- if the

4

Court were to accept our opponents' position, a

5

remarkable array of lawsuits could be brought as RICO

6

actions:

7

allegedly is caused by false statements to customers,

8

suppliers, distributors, marketing agencies, government

9

entities; consumer or end user versus manufacturer for

Competitor versus competitor for harm that

10

harm allegedly resulting from false statements to the

11

first buyer in a distribution chain.

12

And the circuit court cases in the Fifth --

13

Fourth and Fifth and Sixth and Eighth and Eleventh

14

circuits have recognized this, and they require reliance

15

as a part of proximate causation, and we believe this

16

Court should do the same.

17

I also wanted to make the point that to

18

elaborate, in the Neder case, the Government -- and this

19

is a case where the Government ostensibly argues that it

20

wants us not to restrict civil RICO claims.

21

Neder case the Government made the very same argument in

22

trying to expand mail fraud claims under the criminal

23

statutes.

24
25

But in the

And I think that's -- that's a sub rosa
issue in this case.

The Court nine years ago
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

specifically said in a unanimous opinion, with Chief

2

Justice Rehnquist writing for the Court, that the Court

3

disagreed that mail fraud was moored to the common law

4

of fraud, and it is not unmoored in the Neder case.

5

They said it was moored, and even in a criminal

6

prosecution materiality is required.

7

justifiable reliance and injury is not required in a

8

criminal prosecution, to unmoor the mail fraud statute

9

in a civil RICO context and to then make the argument

And although

10

that all sorts of other claims can -- can also be

11

included such as tortious interference -- because at its

12

heart this is a tortious interference case.

21

"racketeer" and to seek treble damages and attorney's

fees in this kind of such an attenuated situation,

23

should not be something that the Court condones.

have.

immediately tell if this was a situation where the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I just go back to a

6

statement you made?

7

on their allegations your client would be indictable for

8

mail fraud?

9

I thought you -- you conceded that

MR. BECKER:

Well, I didn't concede that my

10

client would be indictable for mail fraud.

11

there would have to be -- we'd have to take a careful

12

look at the indictment, certainly.

13

-- that I do -- I do say that the mail fraud statute

14

does not require justifiable reliance or injury.

15

I think that

But I will say that

I think the problem is when you ask the

16

direct -- my client hasn't been indicted for mail fraud,

17

and I don't think it's any -- it's any oversight because

18

this has been a very well known case in Cook County.

19

think the reason, if one were to ask me why my client

20

hasn't been indicted for mail fraud, is because they

21

didn't commit it, because the county in its own rule --

22

the treasurer wrote the rule and expressly says in the

23

rule that she has the exclusive discretion to determine

24

whether or not there has been a violation of the rule.

25

She has not so determined.

And this case has been

Yes, Justice Souter, and also

all of the -- al of the plaintiffs -- the Respondents

10

are still bidding, which I think is an interesting fact.

11

And it's not -- it's in the record because they have an

12

amended complaint where they have pled subsequent sales.

13

That's how far afield from the law of fraud this is

going.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15
16

Are all the shell

corporations still bidding?

17

MR. BECKER:

Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief

there may be new corporations that are, and they are

for tortuous interference, that if that tortious

interference was effected through the use of the mails

by the co-tort features, that that automatically invokes

the RICO statute?

MR. DeBRUIN:

it has not been seriously disputed that we satisfy the

In this case

The county was not harmed.

Well, what happens

how do you divvy that up?

You get to sue for part of the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

since we are talking about a rotational rule, you could

have -- what are these, monthly or annually --

MR. DeBRUIN:

takes the penalty down stopped at five percent or two

6

provide the county will not apply the rotational system.

7

It won't award the lien at all.

If that happened -- and it

The rotational rule only applies when there
are multiple, zero-percent bids.

And Respondents will

10

show, as this case goes forward, that they can identify

11

the specific properties on which there were multiple

12

bids; that the Petitioners and the related entities,

13

which they will prove are related, received liens and

14

thereby increased to the thousands the number of

15

valuable liens that the Petitioners got, leaving the

16

Respondents essentially with hundreds of liens.

17

The key is, the central question is, whether

18

Petitioners can show proximate cause under the standards

19

in Holmes and Anza.

20

is the central question for proximate cause is the

21

directness between the violation alleged and the injury.

22

And in this case there is a direct relation between the

23

violation of mail fraud alleged, the predicate acts, and

24

the injury that Respondents have incurred.

law of civil conspiracy?

7

consistent with that?

In that

How is your argument here

Justice Alito, Beck was a
The issue in Beck was --

10

injury by reason of a violation of the act.

12

violation of the act at issue in Beck was 1962(d), which

13

is a conspiracy to violate the other provisions.

14

what the Court was looking at was the word "conspiracy,"

which was not defined in the statute.

why do you not look to "civil fraud" to find out what

the word "fraud" means in the RICO statute?

So why if you look to civil conspiracy to

MR. DeBRUIN:

I would say two things:

7

First, what that argument would do would make

8

essentially common-law fraud the predicate act under

9

RICO, when instead it is indictable mail fraud, not

10

common-law fraud.

11

And --

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you can say the same in

12

Beck.

13

in RICO, rather than -- the RICO violation, rather than

14

criminal conspiracy.

15

It would make civil conspiracy the predicate act

MR. DeBRUIN:

Well, the Court, again, in

16

Beck, was looking to the common-law word "conspiracy" to

17

apply it in different contexts.

18

common-law fraud that is actionable under RICO.

19

There is not a

But secondly, even if you accept that test,

20

Justice Alito, under the common law of fraud, there is

21

no doubt that claims like ours were actionable and were

22

actionable as fraud.

23

referenced to, the common-law cases involving the buyer

24

of cheese and other facts, those were actionable as

fraud where --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Becker says they were

interference with a business relationship, not fraud.

3

MR. DeBRUIN:

Well, under the law of torts

4

as it has evolved, there are different labels that are

5

applied.

6

the interference through fraud with a contract of

7

another, was actionable at the common law.

8

plaintiff could make out a claim and recover damages,

9

even though the plaintiff had not received the statement

But what was critical is that that conduct,

The

10

at issue and had not relied on the statement at issue.

11

So that even if, under RICO, you were to look for civil

12

purposes to a common-law analogue, the common law made

13

clear that these kinds of claims were actionable,

14

whatever label might be applied to them today in terms

15

of the nature of the -- of the tort.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One concern, because RICO

17

can be a very broad statute, is that if you are right,

18

then any unsuccessful bidder could look through a

19

rival's submission, find a false statement, and sue

20

under RICO.

21

MR. DeBRUIN:

Your Honor, I believe that is

22

not true for the reasons this Court set forth in Anza.

23

The standards set forth in Holmes and in Anza are very

24

rigorous tests to establish proximate cause.

merely assertion of falsity by a competitor -- I mean,
29
Alderson Reporting Company

So the

Anza involved a competitor situation.

2

was that had been mail fraud that caused the competitor

3

harm.

4

There the claim

The Court recognized in Anza that that case

5

was different than Holmes.

There was an allegation of a

6

direct injury in Anza, but nevertheless the relation

7

between the violation and the harm was far less direct

8

than it is in this case, as Judge Easterbrook, Chief

9

Judge Easterbrook explained.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Why -- why is it -- I

11

really worry about adopting a rule which would produce

12

the result that whenever anyone makes a false statement

13

in an official form, someone who is deprived of a

14

business opportunity, or at least can say so, can bring

15

a RICO action.

16

MR. DeBRUIN:

Justice Scalia, I would say

17

two things:

18

realize that Congress enacted RICO to protect

19

competitors.

20

RICO was to protect legitimate businesses that are

21

injured in their business or property by reason of a

22

pattern of racketeering activity as defined under the

23

statute.

24
25

First of all, I think it's critical to

One of the principal motivations behind

That's number one.
Number two, there are important restrictions

that this Court repeatedly has recognized.

enough that there be a single act.

There must be

proximate cause under Holmes and Anza.

restrictions exist.

successfully navigate all of those things, proving not

properties.

2

Those are the bidders at issue.

3

the Respondents, but it is a relatively small group --

4

And those are the properties at issue.

other cases where if we adopt the rule you argue for,

that wouldn't be confined at all.

7

situation where a competitor is defrauding a supplier,

8

every competitor no matter how many there were, could

9

bring a RICO action.

10

MR. DeBRUIN:

For example, in a

Well, I think the Court --

11

again, if you look to the Anza case, the Court has made

12

clear that if a RICO defendant takes actions that simply

13

enhance the defendant's own competitive position, which

14

was the allegation in Anza, that that may not be enough

15

to establish proximate cause.

16

foreseeable and clear effect of defendant's actions is

17

to work a direct injury on competitors and, in fact, on

18

no one else, not on the county, not on the property

19

owners, but only on competitors, that was within the

20

ambit of what Congress sought to protect in RICO.

21
22
23

But whereas here the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Regardless of how

many competitors there are?
MR. DeBRUIN:

Well, yes.

As this Court

24

recognized in Storey Parchment and Hazeltine, in

have to be worked out.

establish a claim.

But the fact that there may be

Is it the law generally in

the States that an unsuccessful bidder can sue the

MR. DeBRUIN:

Justice Kennedy, the

12

common-law rule actually was, I believe, in 27 of 40

14

briefing -- that a disappointed bidder could bring an

15

action at the common law if the allegation was one of

not provide an absolute bar to claims like this.

So that the common law did

Now, again, the issue is:

Will the claims

19

satisfy Holmes and Anza?

20

that standard, the framework this Court established

21

first in Holmes and then applied in Anza, that that

22

framework is inadequate, that it produces an anomalous

23

result here or will produce an anomalous result in other

24

cases.

25

There is no argument here that

It's a very rigorous test.

1

plaintiffs who have suffered injuries by reason of, that

2

is, proximately caused by, a RICO violation.

3

the RICO violation is predicated on an act of mail

4

fraud, the plaintiff ordinarily will need to show that

5

somebody relied on the false statements in order to

6

establish that the fraud was even a "but for" cause of

7

injury.

8
9

Now, when

A plaintiff who can establish that it was
the one who relied on the false statements would be able

to show proximate causation.

11

way to establish proximate causation, and there is no

12

basis for this -- for the imposition of a per se rule

13

requiring that the plaintiff be the one who has relied.

14

Instead when a defendant creates a scheme to defraud

that induces reliance by one party in order to injure

action under --

one in a thousand, and everybody buys a ticket on that

basis, and it turns out that really your chances are one

in a million?

6

nobody can prove he would have won?

MR. MILLER:

Nobody has a cause of action because

No, the participants in the

8

lottery in that case would have a cause of action

9

because they have paid money to the person running the

lottery.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's all they can get?

12

Just what they paid for the ticket?

MR. MILLER:

I think -- I think the -- the

17

long common-law tradition, and with the more modern

18

elaboration of tort law, as demonstrated by the

19

secondary statement, it has sometimes been given a

20

different label, and that is either "injurious

21

falsehood" or "intentional interference with a

22

prospective contractual relation," but at its heart, the

23

action that's at issue here is one that's for fraud.

24

But certainly the recovery

But I would like to say in response to some
of Justice Alito's questions that, with respect to the

Beck case and the relevance of it, that ultimately in

2

our view it doesn't really matter whether the common law

3

would have allowed recovery in this case, and that's

4

because, unlike in Beck where the Court had to consider

5

what is the meaning of -- what does it mean to be

6

injured by reason of a conspiracy?

7

answered that question by looking at the common law of

8

civil conspiracy.

appropriate here if the relevant predicate under 1961

And the Court

That mode of analysis would be

11

made reference to common-law fraud.

12

1961 does not say that; it says "any act which is

13

indictable under section 1341,"

14

So under -- given the structure of the statute, the only

15

inquiry is:

16

which is indictable under 1341?

17

But, of course,

the mail fraud statute.

answers that question.

5

common-law principle of what it means to be injured by

an act of mail fraud because there is no common law of

the relevant inquiry is simply:

10

There is no corresponding

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I don't think it's

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE M. BECKER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BECKER:

Thank you.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The difference between this case and what

2

Congress intended is that, yes, in the comments to the

3

enactment of RICO, Congress did say that it was trying

4

to protect legitimate competitors from illegitimate

5

conduct or unlawful conduct.

6

into a situation where competitors are using RICO as an

7

anticompetitive device, and that's what we believe the

8

reliance requirement will -- will at least rein in,

9

totally consistent with the common law.

This case has now morphed

We are not asking this Court to impose any

10
11

requirement on RICO that does not already exist by

12

reason of the common-law meaning rule.

13

believe our opponents and the S.G.

14

law.

because the Court has construed it over the years.

17

order to construe it now in a civil context, we are

asking the Court to apply the common law meaning rule

If I may I'd like to make a few other

leave this Court under the impression that there is

The

plaintiffs themselves alleged this in paragraph 46, our

2

joint appendix 20 and 21.

3

last few pages of our reply brief show all of the things

4

that would have to be shown in order to have even --

5

even a remote directness of injury in this case.

6

Without belaboring it, the

So the -- we have not -- we have not in any

7

way conceded that the requirements of Anza or Holmes

8

have been met.

9

deals with that.

And -- but I think our brief adequately

I'd also like to point out that RICO and

10
11

mail fraud don't reach everything actionable at common

12

law.

13

that civil RICO in every case involving a false

14

statement -- every case involving a false statement, no

15

matter to whom it's made, would be a civil RICO case.

I mean, if there was an argument, that would mean

16

The general idea of protecting competitors

17

doesn't mean that Congress provided that anything that

18

anyone says to anybody violates civil RICO.

19

the way that this Court interprets statutes; and there

20

is no allegation in the complaint at all as -- that the

21

rotational basis applies only when bids are at zero

22

percent.

23

That's not

In the year 2000 the Illinois Supreme Court

24

confronted the same plaintiff in this case, Phoenix

25

Bond, challenging a very similar rule because at that
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

point in time there was collusion including the same

2

plaintiff to keep the penalty rate at 18 percent.

3

the Illinois Supreme Court said the rule will -- is

4

something that the treasurer has the right to make to

5

try to regulate the bids, and the treasurer certainly

6

can be a victim of this situation.

7

perceived as fair, the treasurer will not have enough

8

bidders in order to sell all the bids, and therefore,

9

the county will not be paid the unpaid taxes.

10

And

If the bid is not

If the treasurer thought that there really

11

was a misrepresentation here made by the Petitioners,

12

the treasurer would have a very great incentive and a

13

very great state in enforcing this rule; and the

14

treasurer did not, we believe because the treasurer

15

doesn't believe there is any violation.

16

The -- the other ways that the county could

17

be injured are that if the -- if the penalty rate goes

18

up beyond zero percent, there is no guarantee that the

19

same number of bidders will -- will come to the sale.

20

There -- I also want to refer the Court to

21

other -- this is not new.

In Safeco Insurance just

22

recently, last term, the Court asked -- was asked to

23

define the term "willfulness" in a civil liability

24

provision of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the

25

Court observed that there is different meanings in the
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

civil and criminal law to the term "willfulness."

In

2

Farmer versus Brennan the Court recognized different

3

uses of the term "recklessness" in the civil and

4

criminal contexts.

5

So once again we are asking this Court to

6

rule consistent with the common law meaning rule that

7

the -- a civil RICO action predicated on mail fraud,

8

where one is -- it has to fulfill the requirement that

9

you have been -- the plaintiff has been injured by

10

reason of mail fraud or racketeering activity.

11

plaintiff must rely on a misrepresentation or the fraud

12

directly, because that's the essence of civil fraud.

13

If there are no further questions.
