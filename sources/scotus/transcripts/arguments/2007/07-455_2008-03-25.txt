ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. MICHAEL B. MUKASEY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
GENERAL MUKASEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

The question in this case is whether a panel

11

of the Ninth Circuit was correct when it added the words

12

"in relation to," and thereby added an element to

13

section 844 of Title 18, and we think for at least four

14

reasons, the answer to that question is no.

15

First, and principally, those words are not

16

in the statute that Congress wrote, and this Court has

17

said many times that courts should not add words or

18

elements to criminal statutes.

19

Second, Congress knows how to include a

20

relational element when it wants to, and in fact, did

21

that in section 924(c) after which section 844 is

22

otherwise patterned.

23

chose to leave "in relation to" out of section 844 it

24

did that intentionally.

25

And that shows that when Congress

Third, when section 844 was amended in 1988,
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

one court of appeals, the only court of appeals to rule

2

directly on the question of whether there was a

3

relationship between the carrying of explosives in the

4

commission of a felony, had held that there was no

5

relational element.

6

fact -­

7

Congress was on notice of that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your argument relies

8

on the notion that the word "during" in the statute is

9

solely temporal.

10

In other words, it just refers to the

time?

11

GENERAL MUKASEY:

Correct.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- that's not

13

always the case.

If I say, you know, I hung lights

14

during the holiday season, you wouldn't think that I

15

hung a chandelier, right?

16

temporal connection, but also a relation.

17

GENERAL MUKASEY:

There'd be not simply a

In that instance, that

18

would be correct.

19

-- in 924(c) said "during and in relation to," it meant

20

something more than a temporal relationship.

21

say the same thing in 844, and it failed to say the same

22

thing in 844(f) or the amended 924(c).

23

On the other hand, when Congress in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It did not

General, could -- could

24

Congress pass a law that said if you wear a wristwatch

25

during the commission of any crime, you get another 10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

years?

2

GENERAL MUKASEY:

A statute like that would

3

be entirely unreasonable.

4

unreasonable for Congress to have said if you carry an

5

explosive during the commission of a felony, you've

6

added something enormously volatile.

7

It was not entirely

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Surely it depends on what

8

the felony is.

If the felony is the filing of a

9

dishonest tax return and -- and you have a can of

10

gasoline with you when you mail the letter, it seems to

11

me quite as absurd as saying wearing a wristwatch in the

12

course of a felony.

13

That's what troubles me about this.

I'm -- I'm tempted to -- I think everybody

14

is tempted to distort the "during" to -- to mean

15

something else, simply because the consequences of

16

performing a completely lawful act wearing a wristwatch,

17

carrying explosives -- given the broad definition of

18

explosives, I guess it would include having -- having

19

some cartridges, explosive cartridges?
GENERAL MUKASEY:

20
21
22

It would.

But the

temptation -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's perfectly lawful,

23

and you get another 10 years for it just because you're

24

-- you're mailing a letter to the IRS at the same time.

25

GENERAL MUKASEY:

It is perfectly lawful.

5

Congress was aware that Title 18, not to mention all the

2

other titles, are chockablock with felonies.

3

thousands of them out there.

4

to make sure that the mainstream that it was concerned

5

with, which is nicely illustrated by the facts of this

6

case, were taken care of; and so it passed a very broad

7

statute.

8

"Any felony" couldn't be broader.

9

There are

But nonetheless, it wanted

We concede that it was a very broad statute.

But that was Congress's choice.

And if

10

Congress chooses to amend the statute, respectfully, it

11

ought to be Congress that amends it.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Mukasey, is there

13

any indication why this prosecutor chose to hook the

14

carrying an explosive onto a false-statement charge,

15

instead of some charges with which it would have been

16

more logically linked, like the one -- the first one,

17

conspiracy to commit an act of terror -- terrorism?

18

GENERAL MUKASEY:

There is.

At the time the

19

case was brought, there was evidence to charge the first

20

count, conspiracy to commit a terrorist act.

21

some evidentiary problems; a great deal of the evidence

22

to support that count did not, in fact, come until

23

almost literally the eve of trial.

24

from overseas.

25

There were

A lot of it came

The count to which the -- the 844 -- the
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

crime to which 844 was, in fact, passed, the making of a

2

false statement, was, to use a colloquialism, a

3

lead-pipe cinch.

4

He had clearly carried an explosive while doing it.

He had clearly made a false statement.

5

That prosecutor's decision, in fact, was a

6

very responsible one, because what was shown when they

7

opened his trunk was that this was a very dangerous

8

person; and they wanted to bring a charge on which they

9

were sure to convict him, so that his carrying of the

10

explosive would get him ten years in addition to that

11

charge.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I guess what's troubling

13

me, Mr. Attorney General, is that it -- it does seem to

14

me fair enough to make that charge in this case; but

15

then we -- but then we have the tremendous number of

16

cases where the prosecutor is going to be in the

17

position in a plea-bargain context, say, to threaten to

18

charge this offense with a heavy mandatory minimum.

19

My understanding is that district judges do

20

not and cannot be involved in plea bargain negotiations;

21

they can look at a plea before it is entered.

22

What can you tell us about the safeguards

23

that might exist in the system generally against -­

24

against overcharging, against charging for something

25

where the result is close to absurd, as in some of these
7

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hypotheticals about the income tax return and the

2

gasoline and so forth?

3

GENERAL MUKASEY:

safeguard that is in the system, in part, involves the

5

history of the system.

3

then what are the other cases you want to prosecute?

4

In the other briefs they list every funny or

5

comical or absurd example they can find; and so I don't

6

believe you want to prosecute those, but tell me if you

7

do.

And if there are some other ones, what are they?

9

GENERAL MUKASEY:

We don't, but,

respectfully, "relationship" doesn't mean in a statute

10

what "relationship" means in conversation.

11

facilitation under a knife.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

It means

It means that -­
Fine.

So suppose, in other

13

words, if we -- if, hypothetically, I were to say, well,

14

here there's a relationship; after all, it is a

15

necessary condition for the lying that he was carrying

16

explosives; and it is foreseeable that he would lie on

17

his passport, because he was carrying explosives

18

illegally.

19

So that's all you need.
In other words, if that were the decision,

20

you would say fine, that's the end of it.

21

GENERAL MUKASEY:

22
23
24
25

It was -- his carrying of

explosives did not facilitate his lying in this case.
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, it didn't facilitate

it, but it caused it.
GENERAL MUKASEY:

Maybe it caused it, and

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

maybe it didn't.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, if it didn't -- all

3

right.

Would you be satisfied with a result that says,

4

look, if this carrying of explosives is related to the

5

felony in the sense that it is a necessary condition and

6

foreseeable that a person would do such a thing, that's

7

sufficient?

8
9

GENERAL MUKASEY:
not.

No, Your Honor, we would

Because there are cases in which it may become

10

necessary to prosecute somebody -- for example, where we

11

have a situation in which we can charge another crime,

12

but the charge of that crime would involve disclosure of

13

classified information; it would disclose methods and

14

sources -- we believe that it was Congress's choice to

15

leave to the judgment of prosecutors the decision of

16

what crimes the charge in conjunction with possession of

17

explosives, and we think that's where the authority

18

should remain.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why is there in the

20

statutes a difference between possession of explosives

21

in this circumstance and possession of firearms?

22

GENERAL MUKASEY:

Possession of explosives

23

inherently involves volatility.

24

explanation.

25

involves a degree of volatility.

You asked for a policy

Possession of explosives inherently
Explosives cause

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

indiscriminate and potentially vast harm.

2

Firearms, for all the harm they cause, cause

3

discriminate harm.

4

Congress to have treated explosives differently from the

5

way it treated firearms.

6

And there's every reason for

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Was -- was the further

7

explanation that what they were doing in amending the

8

firearms statute was tailoring it more precisely to the

9

possible felony by a police officer situation, and they

10

simply did not face that possibility in the explosives

11

statute?

12
13

GENERAL MUKASEY:

I think the history of the

amendments to 924(c) reflects that.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
So it's a difference in

16

two respects.

One is 924(c) has the "in relationship"

17

requirement, and it also has a shorter term.

18

-- in one it is five years, and the other is ten years.

19

Is that right?
GENERAL MUKASEY:

20

It's only

Yes, that's correct,

21

Justice Ginsburg; and that underlines, I think, the

22

dangerousness, or Congress's perception of the

23

dangerousness, and the volatility of explosives.

24

certainly -­

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
11
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Is there any --­

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

GENERAL MUKASEY:

-- this case bears that

out.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is there any policy

4

limitation within the department not to charge under

5

this provision unless there is a relationship between

6

the underlying felony and the use of -- the carrying of

7

explosives?

8
9

GENERAL MUKASEY:
limitation that I'm aware of.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

10
11

There is no policy

And you do have policy

guidelines with money laundering.

12

GENERAL MUKASEY:

We do.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I suppose if you

14

thought there was a problem, you could promulgate them

15

out of your department.

16
17

GENERAL MUKASEY:

I think I'd be ideally

suited to do that.

18

(Laughter.)

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

though, is mandatory, correct?

21
22
23

The ten years,

GENERAL MUKASEY:

The ten years is

mandatory.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if a prosecutor

24

asks for it and there is an underlying felony and there

25

is an explosive, that's an additional ten years, no
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

matter what.

2
3

GENERAL MUKASEY:

That's an additional ten

years, no matter what.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if you get -- the

5

underlying felony is of the sort Justice Scalia was

6

talking about, and let's say the person gets probation

7

on that because, you know, it is the first offense, no

8

harm, he still gets ten years.

9

GENERAL MUKASEY:

He still gets ten years.

10

It is possible, again, to imagine many, many marginal

11

situations; but I think Congress was willing to

12

contemplate that because it wanted to make sure that it

13

swept in the cases that had to be swept in.

14

And to add a relational element would leave

15

us unprotected against the cases that Congress wanted to

16

include, and protected only against the marginal ones.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but how many

18

cases are there likely to be -- this isn't one of them

19

-- where you have no "in relation to" connection

20

whatsoever?

21
22
23
24
25

GENERAL MUKASEY:

How many cases as a matter

of common sense?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Or any historical

record that you're familiar with.
GENERAL MUKASEY:

No historical record that

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I'm familiar with, but I don't have complete knowledge

2

of the historical record.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, in this

4

case, as you point out, there was, of course, a

5

connection.

6

where the prosecutor is interested in charging -­

7

because, as you have indicated, this case is -- there

8

would be an actual connection.

9

you suggest, problems with proof or -- or evidence; but,

And I would have thought in most cases

Now, you may have, as

10

as a practical matter, I'm just wondering how often the

11

question we're concerned about arises.

12

GENERAL MUKASEY:

I don't think -- I'm not

13

aware of any other situation in which it has arisen.

14

But I don't -- I think Congress didn't wanted to rule

15

out anything when it wrote "any felony."

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This isn't a very good

17

case.

If you wanted to bring a really absurd case, you

18

could have picked a better one than this, because there

19

really is something of a connection.
GENERAL MUKASEY:

20

I think -- I think the

21

lessons we learned, particularly about the history, is

22

that we don't want to bring absurd cases, and -- and we

23

don't.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I mean the

interesting thing is that you're -- the cases where this
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is going to arise is not where you're really worried

2

about the explosives; it's going to -- because in that

3

case, presumably there is going to be a relation, and

4

you can use it as you used it in this case.

5

The cases where this is going to be

6

problematic is when you are really interested in the

7

underlying felony.

8

GENERAL MUKASEY:

That -­

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You know, the guy

10

who's driving in his car and calls his broker and is

11

guilty of insider trading and has some firecrackers in

12

the trunk, you're not worried about the firecrackers,

13

but you want to crack down on the insider trading.

14

GENERAL MUKASEY:

That has to do more with

15

the breadth of the definition of "explosives" than it

16

has to do with the question of a relationship, because

17

we may very well be concerned with the person who is

18

committing what sounds like an innocuous felony but

19

carrying a load of explosives in his trunk.

20

weaving in a relational requirement isn't going to solve

21

the problem that's posed in what I think is Your Honor's

22

hypothetical, which is the fact that firecrackers are as

23

much explosives as bombs under the "explosives"

24

definition contained in the statute.

25

So

If there are no further questions, I'd like,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS W. HILLIER, II

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

8
9

MR. HILLIER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

General Mukasey put his finger on the point

11

here when he said we wanted to charge a lead-pipe cinch

12

case.

13

terrorism prosecution and a choice to link the

14

underlying felony -- or to link the carrying explosives

15

charges exclusively to count 5 of the indictment, which

16

charged a false statement, an argument which requests

17

that this Court apply this statute to all sorts of

18

situations theoretically that might even involve

19

explosives that were lawfully carried during a

20

completely unrelated felony.

21

that's what Congress thought, that's what Congress

22

thought when it was creating this statute.

23

But in doing so, what we now have is what was a

And I would disagree that

The words -- in applying this Court's

24

statutory construction regime, what we do first of all,

25

of course, is look to the words of the text to see if it
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

means what the government suggests it does in this case.

2

And as, Chief Justice Roberts, you have already

3

indicated, the word "during" has meanings beyond just

4

that in 401 used here.

5

have significance to describing what the meaning of this

6

particular statute is, and important among those are the

7

terms "in which," which is found in the concluding

8

sentence of the statute.

9

companion word, the largest word in this particular

But also other words in the text

And, of course, that's -- the

10

statute, "explosives," and its very broad definition

11

under 844(j).

12

Taking first the term "in which," which is

13

at the conclusion of 844(h) -- and I'll quote.

14

it says is that the penalty that's going to attach to

15

this prosecution shall run consecutively to, quote, "the

16

felony in which the explosive was used or carried."

17
18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're saying it should

have said "during which"?

19

MR. HILLIER:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

And what

Well, I -­
"During the commission of

which the explosive was used or carried"?

22

MR. HILLIER:

I just think that the words -­

23

the words that were used, Your Honor, establish the

24

notion of a relationship between the felony and the

25

explosive.

The word "in" is, as this Court indicated in
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Dunn v. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 519 U.S.

2

465, is synonymous with the words "in regard to" or

3

"with respect to."

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but just -­

5

just as "during" has more than temporal -- can have more

6

than temporal significance, I think "in" can have

7

temporal significance.

8

MR. HILLIER:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

It does, Your Honor.
We write "in the

holiday season."

11

MR. HILLIER:

That's very true.

And it

12

fact, it has a, quote, "locational" sort of significance

13

also.

14

first definition, is this relational one.

15

might have -­

But as noted in Dunn, its primary definition, its

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And, while it

I assume -- I

17

haven't looked at the dictionary -- but "during's" first

18

relationship -- first definition, I suspect, is

19

temporal.
MR. HILLIER:

20
21
22

It's temporal.

That's

correct.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Could you give an example of

23

where it's not temporal, an example of use of "during"

24

that is not temporal?

25

MR. HILLIER:

I think the example posed by
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Chief Justice to General Mukasey is an example of

2

that, Your Honor.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

But hanging up lights

4

"during" the -- the holiday season doesn't -- that's not

5

a temporal relationship?

6

MR. HILLIER:

It's a -- it is a temporal

7

relationship, but it's a relationship between the act

8

that's occurring also, that's the underlying act.

9

But to get to the point of the -- Chief

10

Justice Robert's question, the fact that the word may

11

have more than one meaning, particularly in this case,

12

does not exclude the fact that the meaning of "in which"

13

includes a relationship.

14

suggested reading of these words in this case, "in

15

which" and "explosives" together, is that there is a

relationship, but there is -­

17

And the most naturally

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Hillier, I -- you know,

18

I will accept maybe more than just for the sake of

19

argument that if you stick to the text alone you've got

20

an argument here for some uncertainty, for some

21

ambiguity.

22

The trouble that I have with your argument

23

is that we're here to consider not only text but

24

statutory history, And the statutory history seems to me

25

pretty tough for you to get over.

The statute was

19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

amended.

2

there was no amendment made, with respect to its

3

cognates, to conform it to the cognate section on

4

carrying a gun that specified "in relation to."

5

seems to me that the most reasonable inference to draw

6

from that statutory history is that when Congress

7

amended and technically re-enacted the statute, when it

8

dropped "unlawfully," that it did not want "during" to

9

be read, as it was in the handgun statute, "in relation

10

And it

to."

11
12

The word "unlawfully" was dropped from it, and

And I -- that's seems to me the tough point
of the argument.

13

What is your response to that?

MR. HILLIER:

Yes, Your Honor.

Two points:

14

First, the idea -- the idea of in pari materia, which

15

would suggest that what's happening in 924(c) ought to

16

be occurring in 844 is -- has not the force that it

17

would if we were talking about amendments to and

18

constructions of the same statute, but rather what we

19

have here are two statutes that are being interpreted by

20

two legislators at different times to achieve different

21

objects.

22

well, the force of that -­

23

And there's no reason to believe that the -­

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The different object -- I

24

mean, the trouble with the different object argument is,

25

as the Attorney General said, there was an evident
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

concern in amending the handgun statute not to sweep in

2

the rogue police officer who happens to have a gun on

3

him when he does something that in fact is unlawful.

4

MR. HILLIER:

Right.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The negative inference from

6

that is that there was an intent in the cognate

7

explosives statute to sweep in people, whether in fact

8

it was in relation to or not in relation to.

9

MR. HILLIER:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10
11

Your Honor, I think that -­
Including the policeman who

had cartridges in his gun, presumably, right?

12

MR. HILLIER:

Well, Your Honor, I think

13

the -- when you're looking at what happened to 844, when

14

"unlawfully" was taken out the words "in which" were

15

added, which I think indicates that Congress had an

16

appreciation of the relationship that's involved in that

17

statute.

18

"unlawfully" was taken out, it seems reasonable to

19

believe that what they were trying to do was conform the

20

statute to the purpose of -- its purpose.

21

purpose did include, when you look at the "explosives"

22

definition, the use of lawful explosives to further

23

crimes.

24
25

While the legislative history doesn't say why

And its

So if somebody has a can of gasoline and
they want to use that to threaten somebody and create a
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Federal crime or to accomplish a Federal crime, before

2

that amendment occurred that -- that would have been a

3

lawful possession of the explosives, so 844(h)(2) would

4

not apply.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, fair enough so far as

6

the argument goes.

But that still leaves Congress

7

taking the -- sort of making it as difficult as possible

8

for you to take the position that you're taking, rather

9

than as easy as possible.

10

Why didn't it put in "in relation to"?

11

MR. HILLIER:

Well, the -- I think we go to

12

yet another statutory construction tool, or at least

13

observation by this Court that said the Congress can use

14

different words in different statutes to accomplish the

15

same thing.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It can do it, but why would

17

it have done so?

18

example sitting there.

19

so if, in fact -- so obvious a thing to do if that's

20

what -- if it intended to come out your way?

21

You've the -- you've got the gun
And why would it not have done

MR. HILLIER:

Well, Your Honor, we don't

22

know it didn't do that because the legislative history

23

doesn't inform us.

24

question with respect to changes done in these two exact

25

statutes, as you read from the government's reply brief,

But to draw an analogy from your

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it is trying to establish through the words "during the

2

commission of" the fact that it is the defendant that

3

committed that crime, in other words it was he that did

4

so.

5

makes complete sense.

6

And we don't take any issue with that; in fact, it

But it's interesting to note that 924(c) in

7

1971 was amended to put these -- to substitute the words

8

"for which he may be prosecuted" instead of "which may

9

be prosecuted."

So one might ask why didn't they put

10

the word "he" into 844 at the same time if there was any

11

question about who the perpetrator of the crime was.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And maybe they said -­

13

maybe because they're trying to draft legislation

14

without using pronouns.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. HILLIER:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Touché, Your Honor.

Yes.

I take it that one of the

18

reasons you make your argument is so that if you prevail

19

and you go back to trial, you would argue that this is

20

not in relation to?

21
22

Is that correct?

MR. HILLIER:
understand your question.

Your Honor, perhaps I didn't
If you could rephrase it.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. HILLIER:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- and then you go back to

3

the trial court, I assume you will argue to the jury

4

that the government can't show that it's in relation to.

5

MR. HILLIER:

Well, Your Honor, if you agree

6

that there's a -- if you agree with the Ninth Circuit in

7

this case, then the case is over.

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. HILLIER:

The government -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

That's right.

Why should we agree with

that?

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it seems to me that in

13

a prosecution, in this prosecution, it might be somewhat

14

difficult to establish in relation to.

15

MR. HILLIER:

It would be difficult -­

Alderson Reporting Company

It is just too

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. HILLIER:

Your Honor, if we can look at

2

the facts of this case, I would respectfully disagree.

3

What was done here was a charging decision which made

4

that task impossible.

5

charged this count with count 1, and we wouldn't be here

6

today because surely the explosives were carried for the

7

purpose of accomplishing the act of terrorism that was

8

charged count 1.

9

The government could have simply

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if there's an "in

10

relationship" requirement, why would it be necessary for

11

the explosives to facilitate the false statement?

12

wouldn't it be sufficient if the false statement

13

facilitated the unlawful use of the explosives?

14
15

MR. HILLIER:

Why

We have a reverse sort of

relationship.

16

Your Honor, two answers to that:

First, it

17

would be at odds with the structure of the statute.

If

18

you look at the whole of 844(h), you see in (h)(1), the

19

crime of using an explosive to -- an explosive to commit

20

an underlying felony.

21

relationship that is carried forward in the language of

22

(h)(2).

And that is that sort of direct

23

But, secondly, that language -- that sort of

24

relationship has been interpreted by this Court in Smith

25

as acknowledged by the government in its briefing to

mean the relationship that we're talking about.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's exactly what's

3

bothering me.

4

to be these weird hypotheticals.

5

a relationship, in my mind.

6

The issue in this case doesn't seem to me
Of course it requires

But I don't see why the relationship

couldn't be exactly the one Justice Alito was talking

about.

with explosives.

I mean, imagine a person has a packed car filled

A

10

policemen comes up; he shoots the policeman.

The reason

11

he shot the policeman was because he had his car packed

12

with explosives.

13

And if this -- if this provision -- I mean,

14

I can't understand why this provision wouldn't be aimed

15

directly at that kind of thing.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

That may be, but I don't

26
Alderson Reporting Company

know -- but you could say that.

2

But the problem is I have to answer the question -- I

3

have to reach an answer that I believe should be

4

sensible.

5

MR. HILLIER:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. HILLIER:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

You could say that.

Yes, sir.
So what should I do -­

Well, Your Honor -­
-- if I think that shooting

the policeman because he's going to catch the criminal

10

filled with explosives is within this statute?

11

similarly, lying to a customs officer so he won't catch

12

me when my car is filled with explosives is within the

13

statute?

14

And

Suppose I believe that, but I also think the

15

statute is not meant to govern those odd hypotheticals

16

that you come up with?

17

but the one I described falls within the word

18

"relationship."

There has to be a relationship,

19

Now what do I do?

20

MR. HILLIER:

Well, Your Honor, the

21

relationship -- if you look at the structure of the

22

statute, surely (h)(1) does not describe that sort of

23

relationship; (h)(2) is the next statute or the next

24

subsection of that statute, and its purpose is simply to

25

capture the same criminal objective here, that is to
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

say, the marriage of explosives and a felony.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

But suppose I don't accept the argument?

4

do in this case?

5

I understand that argument.
Then what do I

That's what I'm asking.

MR. HILLIER:

I would ask the Court -- well,

6

I would think the Court would draw some -- an answer

7

from Smith which did describe a relationship contrary to

8

the way Your Honor is doing with respect to this case

9

that goes back to -- goes -- wasn't instructed that way;

10
11

and so it can't be -- this case still has to go back.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You think on this

12

evidence, on this record, that a jury, if it were

13

instructed to -- that it had to find "in relation to"

14

could return a conviction of guilty including the "in

15

relation to"?

16
17
18

MR. HILLIER:

If this case had been

instructed correctly?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If this case had been

19

instructed according to your theory of the statute and

20

on this record and on this evidence, could a jury find

21

your client guilty?

22

MR. HILLIER:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24
25

No, Your Honor.
That's exactly why the

attorney general says he needs it.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, you got it anyway.

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. HILLIER:

Beg your pardon, Your Honor?

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Could I ask you about the

3

"in which," the "in which" thing?

4

to me that "in which" is in a very sloppy clause anyway,

5

because it says "shall run concurrently with any other

6

term of imprisonment, including that imposed for the

7

felony in which the explosive was used or carried."

8
9

What about the fire?

It has just occurred

It omits fire entirely

-- in which fire or the explosive.

Fire or the

10

explosive was used or the explosive was carried.

It's a

11

pretty sloppy job down at the end of (h), isn't it?

12

So I wouldn't put a whole lot of weight on

13

the "in which" given that the rest of it is so sloppy.

14

MR. HILLIER:

Well, Your Honor, the "in

15

which" -- the point obviously was that it strengthens

16

and informs the relationship here to be more than the

17

coincidental or temporal one the government -­

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If you are being very

19

precise, but whoever wrote that was, obviously, not

20

being very precise because he left out "fire" entirely.

21

MR. HILLIER:

I suppose that goes to the

22

idea that we shouldn't draw a lot of information from

23

the amendments that were occurring on 924 when they

24

weren't even looking at this statute and considering it

25

and its consequences to the changes in 844 -- or having
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

effect in 844.

2

Your Honor, I would just simply conclude by

3

indicating that the terms, which I think we agree,

4

naturally suggest that there must be a relationship, and

5

the breadth of the term "explosives" includes a lot of

6

lawful items that can be carried, if they were carried

7

in a felony, must be related to that felony if you're

8

going to have 844's effect and its purpose, because when

9

you look at the purpose of the act and the way that they

10

constructed it so carefully and thoughtfully in terms of

11

the crimes that were -- or the -- the use of explosives,

12

it applies only to that portion of the statute that

13

involves illegal use of criminal -- of explosives.

14

the combination of all of these elements certainly gives

15

force to our argument and tends to rub -- tends to do

16

the opposite to the government.

17

And

At the end of the day, if there's anything

18

to be said for the government's argument, then there is

19

an ambiguity, and it should be construed in favor of the

20

defendant.

21

And I -- just a concluding point to answer

22

Justice Kennedy's questions, the government could have

23

avoided all of this by simply charging this case, as it

24

should have, by linking count 9 with count 1, where the

25

proof problem wouldn't have been a -- the only
30

difference in the proof would have been -- there would

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. MICHAEL B. MUKASEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20

GENERAL MUKASEY:

I just wanted to make two

21

brief points on rebuttal.

First, Justice Breyer's

22

question and position appears to read in a relational

23

element that's also not in this statute.

24

is that that is something that should be done, if

25

anybody, by Congress.
31
Alderson Reporting Company

And our view

1

And secondly, that the Respondent's

2

reference to gasoline as an explosive I think is a bit

3

of -- is a bit of a reach.

4

generally regarded as an explosive unless it is prepared

5

and processed and presented in a certain way with -- in

6

ways that are not present simply by carrying a can of

7

gasoline to help a -- to help out a friend who's run out

8

of gas.

9

I don't think gasoline is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And maybe gunpowder doesn't

10

include the little bit that's in a cartridge either.

11

You think it does?

12

GENERAL MUKASEY:

I think it does.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, could I ask

14

you, do you have an answer to your friend's point about

15

the "in which" language?

16

GENERAL MUKASEY:

The "in which" simply

17

includes both, number one, the use -- the actual use

18

and, number two, the carrying.

19

I agree that it's not a model of elegant

20

construction, but "in which" does include the two, both

21

the actual use and the mere carrying.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I understood his

23

point to be that it's surprising that they refer to use

24

of the explosives or carrying of the explosives with

25

reference to the underlying felony, "in which" the -­
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

suggests that the explosive was used or carried with

2

respect to the underlying felony.

3
4

And I understood your position to be that it
doesn't have to be.

5

GENERAL MUKASEY:

No, I think it suggests

6

simply that the underlying felony was, in fact,

7

committed.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it was going to be -­

it was going to be inaccurate as to one or the other of

one or two.

would be inaccurate as to one.
