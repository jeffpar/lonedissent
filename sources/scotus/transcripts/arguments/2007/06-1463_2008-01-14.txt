Mr. Schleimer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH D. SCHLEIMER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. SCHLEIMER:

9

Justice, and may it please the Court:

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief

It's been a little less than two years since

11

this Court handed down the decision in Buckeye Check

12

Cashing Service v. Cardegna.

13

Buckeye was decided, the California Court of Appeal

14

issued its decision in this case excising the issue of

15

validity or legality of a contract from an entire

16

category of arbitrations, declaring it off limits to

17

arbitration.

18

Within nine months after

The contract in this case couldn't be more

19

clear.

20

or legality of the contract shall be arbitrated.

21

there was no consideration given to the intent of the

22

parties.

23

It states quite specifically that the validity
So

The Federal Arbitration Act, of course,

24

applies in this case.

There was never really a dispute

25

about that, because it'S a contract between the citizens
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of two States and it was never disputed that the Federal

2

Arbitration Act would apply.

3

If left standing, the decision in this case

4

could result in a multiplicity of State law decisions

5

and statutes eliminating arbitration in entire classes

6

of cases through the mere expediency of having it go to

7

an administrative agency.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
eliminate it.

Well, It wouldn't

Your friend on the other side says it the

10

simply delays it, because you get to arbitrate de novo

11

after the commissioner's decision.

12

MR. SCHLEIMER:

Well, the assertion that we

13

get to arbitrate de novo is new in this Court.

14

courts below the parties agreed, and both sides briefed,

15

the fact that the de novo would be heard by the superior

16

court, not by the arbitrator.

17

what magical process the Respondent would think that we

18

would get to arbitrate the de novo, because the statute

19

on which the court of appeal based its jurisdictional

20

holding, Labor Code Section 1700.44, that's where the

21

labor commissioner gets jurisdiction from the same

22

statute and says the superior court hears the de novo.

23

In the

I don't know what -- by

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I guess I

24

could let him answer, but I suppose he would say you go

25

to that court, and you get a motion to compel
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

arbitration.

2

MR. SCHLEIMER:

Well, we have brought a

3

motion to compel arbitration, which was denied based on

4

1700.44.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I couldn't find the order

6

that the court -- in the record it says that the order

7

would be -- the court granted a preliminary injunction,

8

the superior court, and then it said, according to an

9

order to be entered by the clerk.

How long was the

10

arbitration stayed for?

There was an enjoined -- there

11

was an injunction.

12

Just until further order of the court?

13

MR. SCHLEIMER:

What was the term of the injunction?

The injunction states -- and

14

I'm implying this, because it doesn't actually state how

15

long it lasts -- the injunction was requested and it was

16

granted with just the word "grant."

17

as meaning that what was granted was what was requested,

18

and what was requested was an injunction that would last

19

until the Labor Commissioner determined that she doesn't

20

have jurisdiction.

21

had already determined that she does have jurisdiction,

22

it's effectively permanent or, as you say,

23

Justice Kennedy, until the court vacates it.

24
25

So I interpret it

Now, since the Labor Commissioner

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Did the Respondent at any

point indicate that after the Labor Commission, Labor
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Commissioner, made a determination that they would not

2

go to superior court for de novo review?

3

MR. SCHLEIMER:

Well, they actually had in a

4

sense an opportunity to do exactly that and chose not

5

to.

6

the Labor -- before the arbitrator one day before the

7

injunction hearing.

8

inefficient to have parallel proceedings and maybe I can

9

benefit from the Labor Commissioner's advice in this.

The motion for reconsideration was brought before

The arbitrator said:

Well, it's

10

So while retaining his jurisdiction, he said:

I'm going

11

to stay the arbitration until the Labor Commissioner

12

rules.

13

Now, at that point the Respondent could have

14

simply withdrawn the injunction and said, fine, we'll do

15

it the way the arbitrator says; what the arbitrator

16

wants, the arbitrator shall get.

17

the arbitrator's decision became moot.

18

arbitrator, acting with an injunction looming the next

19

day, was proposing in a sense a kind of compromise:

20

can both have a little bit of what you want.

21

unusual in arbitrations for that to happen.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Instead, the next day
Now, I think the

It's not

Well, you may have a

23

right to go to arbitration under this context, to

24

proceed at once to arbitration.

25

parallel proceeding from going on before the Labor

But could you stop a

6
Alderson Reporting Company

You

Official - Subject to Final Review

Commission?

2

the arbitration contract I'm stuck, I have to arbitrate

3

at once, but I can go to the Labor Commission; there's

4

nothing in the Federal Arbitration Act that says I can't

5

do that.

6

In other words, your adversary says under

MR. SCHLEIMER:

Justice Ginsburg, I think

7

that if the motion to compel arbitration had been

8

granted -- remember there were two motions pending, my

9

motion to compel arbitration and the Respondent's motion

10

for an injunction to stop the arbitration.

11

If the motion to compel arbitration had been

12

granted, I think that would have been in effect a

13

mandamus to Judge Ferrer that he had to arbitrate and

14

not proceed.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I would have thought you

16

would -- you would say that when you have a contract

17

which says that any disputes under this shall be

18

arbitrated pursuant to the rules of the AAA or whatever,

19

that that does automatically exclude a parallel

20

proceeding.

21

sense at all; they achieve nothing.

22

Otherwise, provisions like that make no

MR. SCHLEIMER:

Justice Scalia, I would

23

certainly agree that it's a breach of the contract to

24

file a parallel proceeding.

25

specific performance.

The question, of course, is

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What do you -- what do you

2

make, in answering Justice Scalia's question, what do

3

you make of the fact that this contract included, I

4

guess, a choice of law provision to the effect that

5

California law applies, and if California law comes in

6

so does the jurisdiction of the Labor Commissioner?

7

that in effect you have implicitly agreed to take the

8

Labor Commissioner as well as agreeing to arbitrate, and

9

the argument is the Labor Commissioner comes first.

10

MR. SCHLEIMER:

So

Well, Justice Souter, I have

11

two responses to that.

12

an express agreement to arbitrate validity or legality,

13

that there is certainly no basis for saying that there's

14

some implied intent to contradict the express agreement.

15

My first is that, since there's

The second is that, assuming for a moment

16

that we have incorporated California law wholesale, and

17

California has a lot of law, one of the laws that

18

California has, as set forth in the case I cited,

19

Qualcomm v. Nokia, a Federal Circuit decision in 2006

20

under California law, California law has a rule that if

21

you incorporate the AAA rules into your agreement, you

22

meet the First Option standard that you have agreed to

23

arbitrate arbitrability.

24
25

Now, if we have incorporated California law,
we have incorporated the law that says the arbitrator's
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

decision, his initial decision saying I've got

2

jurisdiction, let's hear some evidence, then that's

3

incorporated in California law -

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do you agree that the

5

question of implicit option of California law is at

6

issue in the case as it gets to us?

7

MR. SCHLEIMER:

I don't believe that Volt is

8

properly in the case.

If you look at the court of

9

appeals decision, the decision is based on jurisdiction,

10

it's not based on intent of the parties.

11

about the intent of the parties that you imply from a

12

choice of law clause.

13

is so clearly expressed that we're going to arbitrate a

14

particular issue, I don't think you even get to an

15

implied intention.

16

Volt is all

And if the intent of the parties

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why isn't that an issue in

17

the case, unless you're waiving the issue?

18

be a question of contract interpretation as to the

19

meaning of the choice of law provision that should be

20

decided by the arbitrator?

21

that argument.

22

MR. SCHLEIMER:

Wouldn't it

Unless you want to waive

I that that Volt should be

23

rejected.

But in the alternative, I think under First

24

Options it should be remanded to the arbitrator.

25

they want to make an argument that we didn't intend to
9
Alderson Reporting Company

If

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

arbitrate arbitrability, even though California law is

2

per se on that point in our favor, then you have the

3

option of remanding that question to the arbitrator.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I have to

5

confess I've never understood these choice of alaw

6

provisions.

7

California law is interpreted consistent with Federal

8

law.

9

what you're incorporating.

10
11

You incorporate California law.

I assume

If Federal law preempts California law, that's
It always struck me as kind

of circular.
MR. SCHLEIMER:

Well, I think lawyers do it

12

reflexively because out of fear that somehow the law in

13

some other State that they don't know is going to wind

14

up being the conflict of law -

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When you say

16

California law applies, you don't mean to the exclusion

17

of Federal law?

18

MR. SCHLEIMER:

Of course not.

I mean, if

19

one incorporates California law, one doesn't incorporate

20

pre-empted California law.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Nor do you mean that

22

California applies even when it contradicts the express

23

provisions of your agreement?

24

governs of the general?

25

MR. SCHLEIMER:

I mean, the specific

Absolutely.
10

Alderson Reporting Company

The Federal

Official - Subject to Final Review

Arbitration Act is all about effectuating the intent of

2

the parties to expeditiously and privately decide the

3

issue.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I must say that the Volt

5

case is written in rather sweeping language that's not

6

particularly helpful to you.

7

different because there were other parties, independent

8

parties in the litigation.

9

best way to distinguish Volt in your case?

10

MR. SCHLEIMER:

On its facts, I think it's

Don't you think that's the

Certainly.

To that I would

11

add the observation that under Volt, since there were

12

parties that were not bound by arbitration, you are

13

going to have all the expense of the other lawsuits,

14

anyway.

15

proceeding, in Volt you were going to have a

16

multiplication of litigation no matter what you did.

17

Here that's not true.

18

multiplication of litigation is because Judge Ferrer

19

filed a Labor Commissioner petition and then a Superior

20

Court lawsuit.

21

So, you have in terms of the efficiency of the

The only reason we had a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, would you

22

have any problem with a California law that said you can

23

arbitrate but the arbitrator must allow the Labor

24

Commissioner to file an amicus brief?

MR. SCHLEIMER:

I don't know the Labor

3

I wouldn't be

I know -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if it goes on

4

and says, and you must allow the Labor Commissioner to

5

appear at the arbitration?

6

MR. SCHLEIMER:

Well, that is what 1700.45

7

says for talent agents.

In 20 years I've never heard of

8

the Labor Commissioner doing that.

9

anyone is going to be awfully concerned about it.

But I can't imagine
I

10

certainly wouldn't be.

12

based on a legal right because my client's a personal

13

manager and isn't regulated by the talent agency -

14

If the Labor Commissioner wanted
I don't think that's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, what if it says

15

you've got to wait for 30 days to allow the Labor

16

Commissioner to consider whether or not to intervene?

17

MR. SCHLEIMER:

I'm not sure -- I

18

certainly -- personally, in this case no problem with

19

that.

20

simply requires notice and an opportunity to attend; and

21

there's no issue in this case as to whether the Labor

22

Commissioner was deprived of that, because we never got

23

to that point.

24
25

I don't think that's how it works.

They actually have the power to

At one point many years ago, there was an

10

and there was an arrest and there was a criminal statute

14

incident by repealing the criminal statute.

And the legislature responded to this

15

So the only action the legislature has had

16

since deregulating the managers and taking them out of

17

the statute entirely was removing the criminal

18

enforcement power.

19

civil enforcement powers, there are statutes.

20

hundred sections in the labor code do give the Labor

21

Commissioner certain intervention powers.

22

those statutes, they would seem to apply in wage cases

23

and confiscation of tools, that sort of thing.

don't really mention -- now would the Labor

25

Commissioner -- if the Labor Commissioner wanted to

But, reading

They

intervene, I think that if you take the penumbra of all

2

these statutes probably the Labor Commissioner could.

3

I think, even though there's not in my 20

4

years handling these cases been a situation where the

5

Labor Commissioner filed any kind of a civil proceeding,

6

everybody assumes the Labor Commissioner could seek an

7

injunction if they wanted to.

8

because they're busy doing things like collecting wages.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It just doesn't occur

Could the arbitrator

10

decide, I know I'm not required to do this but the Labor

11

Commissioner is the expert and I'd rather wait until the

12

Labor Commissioner acted before I proceed with the

13

arbitration?

14

MR. SCHLEIMER:

Well, in a sense, under the

15

gun of the injunction hearing the next day, that's what

16

the arbitrator did.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Take out the exception.

18

The arbitrator just thinks that it would be good to have

19

the advice of the Labor Commissioner because the

20

arbitrator is not so familiar with these talent agency

21

arrangements.

22

MR. SCHLEIMER:

I would certainly protest,

23

but the arbitrator undoubtedly has the power to wait for

24

the Labor Commissioner to render an advisory decision.

In a sense that's what the arbitrator did.

That's why I

referred to it as irrational exuberance, because the

then they move on to other jobs, and you wind up with

people who hear wage claims.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If you go to the superior

for an order enforcing its decision?

Commissioner's decision?

this is a judgment binding on the parties and the

consistently with my order?

If the Respondent prevails

Now what stops him from doing

2

MR. SCHLEIMER:

Well, the Federal

Arbitration Act and the California Arbitration -

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

The Federal -- the Federal

4

Arbitration Act says what that makes it clear he can't

5

do that?

6

MR. SCHLEIMER:

Well -

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, I grant you if he

8

can do it you might as well tear up the Federal

9

Arbitration Act and throw it out the window.

But I just

10

want to know what is it in the law specifically that

11

stops him from doing that.

12

MR. SCHLEIMER:

Well, I think in Section 3

13

would -- there should be a stay of the judicial

14

proceedings so that the arbitration can proceed.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that's not positive

16

Federal law.

17

18

The FAA just says that the State will not set aside that

contractual agreement.

What stops him from doing it is the

MR. SCHLEIMER:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

The

obligation comes from the contract.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So even though it's not -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

all disputes under this contract, it means we'll

25

arbitrate all disputes under this contract; neither one

of us will go to court.

2

MR. SCHLEIMER:

I think that's doubly so if

3

you incorporate the rules of the American Arbitration

4

Association, which provides you with the maximum

5

breadth.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, but that -- that's

7

what I'm driving at, and I think that's interesting,

8

that there's an implicit -- because it doesn't say it

9

explicitly -- there's an implicit promise not to

10

undermine this contract by running off to court.

11

MR. SCHLEIMER:

I think it's a covenant of

12

good faith and fair dealing.

13

should do it.

If you agree to do it you

MR. BRUNSTAD:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Even though in this case

6

you have assumed that that arbitration has to be stayed

to be stayed, and you would not ask for it to be stayed,

MR. BRUNSTAD:

So the case does not have

Then, we go to arbitration.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That is correct.

If this Court rules

If the

Chief Justice

Mr. Brunstad, I'm looking

18

at the point in which you said this in your brief.

19

said you go to the labor commission, and then you go to

20

the Superior Court.

21

You

This is page 13 of your brief.

The court is required to grant a motion

22

compelling arbitration if the parties have executed a

23

valid and applicable arbitration agreement.

24
25

Well, who determines if the parties have
executed a valid and applicable arbitration agreement?
38

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Under First Options here,

2

were it not unmistakably clear that the parties said

3

that the arbitrator should decide arbitrability, that

4

would be for the court to decide.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, we know -- this is

6

not a mystery in this contract.

It says it in the

7

contract, and it says it under the AAA rules.

8

phrased this in your brief in a way that says, well, if

9

the parties have executed a valid and applicable

But you

arbitration agreement, that's what the superior court is

11

going to decide.

12

unless it determines that the parties have executed the

13

valid and applicable arbitration agreement.

14

So it won't grant a motion to compel

MR. BRUNSTAD:

And what I meant in that

15

language, Justice Ginsburg, is simply this:

16

example, if the arbitration clause were invalid because

17

the arbitration clause, itself, were, say, fraudulent

18

or -- for something, then it would not be validate and

19

applicable; or if the scope of the arbitration clause

20

were limited in some way, then the scope issue, the

21

arbitrability issue, is for the court to decide as this

22

Court decided in First Options.

For

Here we do not have the unmistakably clear

24

language that the parties intended that the question of

39

So the

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

court would decide if, in fact, the JUSTICE BREYER:

Right, this is -- this is

3

-- actually now we are getting to the bottom of

4

something here, I think.

5

Now, I am beginning to understand where you

6

are coming from; and Volt does offer you considerable

7

support, as I -- as I agreed.

8

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Yes, Justice Breyer.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, Volt,

10

however, is a case, I take it, in which the stay that

11

was entered was a stay staying the arbitration pending

12

the resolution of a judicial dispute that was not

13

subject to arbitrability.

14

MR. BRUNSTAD:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.
Therefore, it seems to me

16

that the question here concerns the meaning of this

17

contract, and that's where we started.

18

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Yes.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Does this contract mean

20

that the parties who entered have promised, one, not

21

themselves to go to court?

22

MR. BRUNSTAD:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Yes.

5

MR. BRUNSTAD:

No, Justice Breyer.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Justice's initial question which I have been trying to

get to.

10
11

And that is when the parties incorporated

California law, what did they incorporate?
Well, in Volt this Court answered:

When

12

they incorporated California law, it was California law;

13

not California law with a gloss of Federal law, but

14

California law.

Section 1281 of the California Code of Civil Procedure,

litigation with two companies with whom it had no

That involved Stanford and two

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

But

19

here I think the Court has drawn the proper distinction

20

between, on the one hand, Volt and, on the other hand,

21

Doctor's Associates, Mastrobuono, Perry, Allied-Bruce,

22

all of those cases where the Court has said if it is an

23

arbitration negating rule, you don't incorporate it,

24

because that's fundamentally at war with the decision to

25

arbitrate.
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But where it's merely an arbitration

2

postponing rule, which was the procedural issue in Volt

3

and the procedural issue here, then we respect that and

4

say that's not pre-empted, because it's not necessary to

5

pre-empt.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

How can we decide this case

7

on the assumption that this is simply an arbitration

8

postponing rule when there's no California case that

9

says that, do you acknowledge?

10

And a party resisting arbitration could well

11

argue that the California Code means that you go first

12

to the Labor Commissioner and then, as the statute says

13

explicitly, the parties are entitled to a de novo review

14

before the Superior Court without making any provision

15

for arbitration.

16

California courts could interpret the statute to mean

17

that, that there's no room for arbitration in the -- in

18

this scheme?

19

Do you think it is inconceivable the

MR. BRUNSTAD:

It is inconceivable,

20

Justice Alito, that the California court would say that

21

arbitration is not permissible in this case.

this Court said, that it will indulge every intent to

5

give effect to such proceedings, the arbitration

proceedings, in Section 1281.

statutes and say if you if you have a right to

8

arbitrate, we will respect that and we will harmonize

9

the laws so we respect that.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So the California Supreme

19

that the Judge Alex television program is solicited and

20

21

22

that, and I never got the chance.

23

deposed.

I offered to prove

I

He didn't want to be

24

So, there was a full evidentiary hearing.

25

The evidence just wasn't considered because the legal
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

standard that was applied was there's a colorable claim

2

under the Talent Agencies Act, so you can't arbitrate

3

until it's resolved.

4

Now I saw this as being a long trek through

5

the courts.

I don't know when the arbitrator gets to

6

make his decision.

7

rules that the contract is void and then we have a de

8

novo and the Superior Court does that, and the court of

9

appeal does it, and then the California Supreme Court

If -- if the Labor Commissioner

10

rules the contract is void, does the arbitrator get to

11

overrule that.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Regardless of the -- I now

13

understand better than I did what I take as a pretty

14

strong argument.

15

I'm not saying convincing, but strong.

And that would be this:

If you go look at

16

Volt, and in Volt the Court said that the California

17

Code meant that the individual who'd entered into the

18

arbitration contract could go and can ask a superior

19

court to stay an arbitration while some unrelated -

20

some unrelated -- I mean directly related but not the

21

same parties -- litigation took place.

22

The Court didn't in Volt say that that

23

question of interpreting this contract is for the

24

arbitrator.

25

I don't know why it didn't.

But it didn't.

Now here he's making a parallel argument.
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

He's saying that the California Code says that people

2

should first go to that Labor Commissioner and that you

3

can stay arbitration while that goes on.

4

Now -- and I say well, why don't you go to

5

the arbitrator?

6

arbitrator on that one, but he points to Volt.

7

He says I don't want to go to the

And so the puzzle is this:

if the Court in

8

Volt didn't say this is a matter for the arbitrator,

9

whether the contract really means that you promise not

10

to go into court and make a motion to stay, why here is

11

it a matter for the arbitrator whether you implicitly

12

promised not to go into court and asked him to stay

13

pending the outcome of this administrative proceeding?

14

What do you think about that?

15

MR. SCHLEIMER:

16

I certainly think that the

arbitrator had jurisdiction to arbitrate arbitrability.

17

And the reason for that is the Qualcomm case

18

and the Dream Theater case is a California case cited in

19

Qualcomm, and that the arbitrator should have decided

20

all these issues.

21

I would make this observation.

If we -- if

22

we had gone to the arbitrator and Judge Ferrer had said

23

look, this contract is illegal, said you don't have

24

jurisdiction, and I want you to rule you don't have

25

jurisdiction, the same illegality issue would be a

like some help on that one.

16

I see all the common sense of your position.
But to get -- you only need one really
And he's saying whatever the other ones

MR. SCHLEIMER:

Because in Volt the contract

17

was silent, and the Federal Arbitration Act was silent

18

on the issue that was presented, and State law supplied

19

the answer.

of -

21

The California Arbitration Act has a number

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that's always the

22

case.

It's always the case that the arbitration is

23

quiet on this.

24

that it is absolutely quiet, but it is also absolutely

25

clear that it is State law.

It is -- the Respondent's position is

MR. SCHLEIMER:

The contract here, I would

2

submit, Justice Kennedy, is not quiet because it says

3

that validity or legality shall be arbitrated.

4

that's what we are talking about.

5

silent contract.

6

that question.

7

So you don't have a

You have a contract that speaks to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm not sure that Volt

8

would have been different.

9

very broadly, it seems to me, in favor of the

10

And

Volt is -- Volt is written

Respondent's position.

11

MR. SCHLEIMER:

Volt was written under the

12

California Arbitration Act, and speaking as a California

13

practitioner that had had a lot of cases, you might

14

notice that the same section in Volt was the basis for

15

my motion to compel arbitration.

16

CC P 1281.2.

17

of the Federal Arbitration Act, but the California

18

Arbitration Act has a number of provisions where the

19

Federal Arbitration Act is silent.

20

dealing with multi-party litigation where parties are

21

not bound.

22

See codicil procedure

CC P 1281 is almost identical to Section 2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

One of those is

You think Volt would have

23

come out the same way if -- if in fact, all of the

24

parties in this other litigation had agreed to

25

arbitration?

about, was the fact that -

7

Yeah.

I do, too.

That's what Volt was all

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Writing broadly is known as

dictum, isn't it?

(Laughter.)

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I suppose if we write the

10

case your way, we have to talk about what happens if

11

this Labor Commissioner had enforcement powers, that

12

they had the sua sponte right to invoke, and that they

13

did?

14

MR. SCHLEIMER:

I think the Labor

15

Commissioner probably does.

16

the adjudicatory versus prosecutorial function of an

17

administrative agency.

18
19

I think it has to do with

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

proceeding brought by the administrative agency.

20

MR. SCHLEIMER:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But this is not a

No.
An agency like the EEOC

Waffle House.
MR. SCHLEIMER:

This is -- this is an -

24

this is an administrative agency providing an

25

adjudicatory forum.
57

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This is somebody who's

2

bound by arbitration invoking whatever authority the

3

Labor Commissioner has, quite different from the Labor

4

Commissioner commencing a proceeding.

5

MR. SCHLEIMER:

Waffle House was all about

6

the prosecutorial or administrative power.

7

is about the adjudicatory -

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This

Well, your friend

9

says that this agency has exactly that power, and the

10

reason you required these things to go before her, is

11

that she knows what's going on in the area and, if

12

appropriate, can take the supervisory authority or

13

whatever the equivalent of prosecutorial action is.

14

MR. SCHLEIMER:

I think I pointed out in my

15

papers that nothing stops Judge Ferrer from putting a

16

dime in the phone, calling the Labor Commissioner and

17

complaining, saying there's been illegality here.

18

may request some evidence at that point.

19

is that the prosecutorial discretion will be exercised

20

by the Labor Commissioner acting in an essentially

21

executive branch function.

22

They

But the point

Here in our case, all they did was supply a

23

hearing room and a hearing officer, an adjudicatory

24

function.

25

is adjudicate the case.

That's what the arbitrator is supposed to do,
That's the distinction.
58

And I

see Gilmer as being a situation where there's an attempt

2

to avoid adjudicating in the agreed forum.

3

Waffle House as saying that we're not going to hogtie

4

administrative agencies when they perform the

5

prosecutorial function, the administrative function.

And I see
