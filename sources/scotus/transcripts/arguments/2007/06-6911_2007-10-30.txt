We'll hear argument

Mr. Coad.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. COAD
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. COAD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The provision at issue determines which

11

convictions constitute a prior felony for imposition of

12

the Federal firearms ban and its increased penalties.

13

Its exemption clause prescribes certain ways in which a

14

conviction that otherwise meets that definition is

15

nevertheless exempt.

16

State's indication that an offense is deprived of any

17

continuing effect, such as whether the status of an

18

offender's civil rights are the same after a conviction

19

as they were before conviction.

20

Specifically, it looks to a

The issue before the Court is whether the

21

statute should be read to exempt convictions for which

22

civil rights were lost and later regained while at the

23

same time not exempting a conviction for which civil

24

rights were never lost, even though both -- in the end,

25

both offenders have their civil rights following their
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

conviction.
Congress's underlying objective in drafting

3

the exemption clause was to ensure that Federal law

4

respected a State's considered judgment that a

5

particular offense should not subject a person to the

6

Federal firearms law.

7

interpretation, which counted convictions for which

8

rights were never lost, fails to respect that judgment.

9

It disregards the State's unequivocal indication to the

The Seventh Circuit's

10

Federal statute that an offender is worthy of fully

11

participating in civic life.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if you had a

13

statute -- a State like, I'm told, Vermont, that doesn't

14

take away any one's civil rights, not even a first

15

degree murderer's, then that first degree murderer would

16

be equated to someone whose civil rights were taken away

17

and then restored.

18

MR. COAD:

That's correct.

And I think that

19

the Government points to Maine as an example where no

20

offenders lose their civil rights, but felons lose their

21

gun rights and certain misdemeanants also lose their gun

22

rights, but get that gun right back.

23

Maine and in Vermont, the "unless" clause still applies

24

and still precludes those types of convictions.

25

think when the Government alleges that there are certain
4
Alderson Reporting Company

And in States like

So I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

anomalies that arise from our interpretation, it is

2

simply not the case, and if they are anomalies that

3

arise from our interpretation -

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They're not anomalies

5

because the gun prohibition would cover them, even

6

though they never had their civil rights taken away?

7

that -- is that what you're saying?

8
9
10

MR. COAD:

Correct.

Is

We have to read the -

both clauses, the exemption clause and the unless cause.
And -

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Coad, how are -- how

12

are civil rights which have been taken away typically

13

restored?

14

them?

15

certain number of years?

What is -- what is the process for restoring

Just if you don't commit another offense within a

16

MR. COAD:

It depends on the State.

In the

17

NACDL lodging that the Court has -- I believe 29 States

18

were identified as having some type of restoration

19

procedures.

20

operation of law.

21

met by the offender.

22

The majority of those, it is by automatic
So there's no subsequent conditions

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but even -- even

23

there I assume the law waits for a certain passage of

24

time, and I would assume that there can be no felony

25

committed during that interim period or the person's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

sentence has to be served or something?

2

it's prospective.

3

component, in that -- that is not present in the statute

4

that we're faced with here.

5

It's ongoing,

And so restoration has a real

MR. COAD:

Well, I think that there really

6

isn't a difference between -- by operation of law, a

7

State taking away someone's rights and giving it back or

8

allowing a offender to retain civil rights -

9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it is of -- maybe no

difference if the operation of law is 24 hours later.

11

MR. COAD:

It could be a matter -

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I assume that's not

13

the case.

14

Justice Scalia's question indicates, a certain passage

15

of time that takes place.

16

I assume that there's in every case, as

MR. COAD:

It could be as short as 24 hours.

17

In certain States if a probationer is convicted, rights

18

aren't taken away.

19

sentenced to even one day in jail those rights are in

20

theory taken away for that one day and restored to that

21

offender the minute he walks out of jail.

22

But if a felony offender is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you -- you can say,

23

however, that -- that in the restoring situation, there

24

is at least a greater individuation of the -- of the

25

State's determination of the -- the trustworthiness of
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the individual to be -- to be trusted with arms.

2

That is to say well, this person has not

3

committed an offense within so many years.

4

some States, it may be an individual determination.

5

That's why I asked you the question.

6

one, you apply to have them restored?

7

MR. COAD:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

Or maybe in

Is it ever one by

In a minority of States, yes.
Well, I mean, that's -

that's a totally different thing from just a gross

10

determination by a State that everybody who commits this

11

crime does not lose -- does not lose firearm rights.

12

I think it's -- it's -- there's a greater

13

degree of assurance when you're dealing with those

14

States that -- that have some degree of individuation.

15

At least this is an individual who hasn't committed an

16

offense for so many years.

17

have to apply personally, I think they're different

18

situations.

19

MR. COAD:

Or in those States where you

I -- I don't think they are, Your

20

Honor.

21

day in jail, your rights are lost and restored.

22

there really isn't any difference between a broad

23

legislative determination by a State -

24
25

As I just mentioned there are States in which a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

Well, but I'm

suggesting -- and I haven't done the research -- that
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that's atypical.

2

MR. COAD:

No, it's not atypical.

In 18 out

3

of the 29 States identified in the NACDL lodging, rights

4

are automatically restored.

5
6

There's no -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think it's atypical to

give a felon one day in jail.

7

MR. COAD:

Well, it could be a misdemeanor.

8

There are certainly misdemeanors punishable by more than

9

two years.

In fact two of the misdemeanors at question

10

here that were punishable by more than two years, my

11

client did not serve a day in jail.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But a misdemeanor?

13

MR. COAD:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I see.

So there are misdemeanors I understand that -

15

I understand that it is rare for misdemeanants to lose

16

their civil rights.

17

MR. COAD:

It -- that's the assumption.

But

18

here we've identified in at least 12 States -- excuse

19

me, 16 States misdemeanors punishable by more than two

20

years or felonies, rights are retained.

21

So there are States, for example, Maryland,

22

where rights are lost for a misdemeanor punishable by

23

more than two years.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
minority approach.

But certainly the

In most States if you are convicted
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of a misdemeanor you do not lose civil rights?

2

MR. COAD:

Absolutely.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So your argument, if

4

accepted, would essentially weed out, or at least for a

5

majority of the States, weed out subdivision

6

(a)(20)(A)(b) -- (a)(20)(B)?

7

coverage under the statute if you are convicted under a

8

misdemeanor and you want to say, well, if your civil

9

rights were never taken away, you shouldn't be covered.

10

Well, that would mean most misdemeanors aren't going to

11

be covered.

12

MR. COAD:

13

that's not the case.

14

case.

15

In other words, there's

Well, in, for example, Maryland,
In many -- in 12 States, it is the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if I say most

16

misdemeanors aren't going to be covered, it's not an

17

answer to say, well, here's one State where they are

18

covered.

19

It's maybe 49 are not.
MR. COAD:

There really are only 16 States

20

in total that have misdemeanors punishable by more than

21

two years where rights are retained.

22

about a very big group to begin with.

23

an issue on the margins.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We're not talking
This certainly is

Mr. Coad, may I ask you a

question that involves the comparison of what, for
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

shorthand purposes I'll call Subsection (20) and

2

Subsection (33).

3

and (20) applies here.

4

position that under (33), your argument could not

5

prevail because the language of (33) makes it clear that

6

there's got to be a -- in effect, a revocation of the

7

right first, before there can be a restoration within

8

the meaning of that statute?

9

You accept that?

I take it, it is your position that But I take it that it's your

10

MR. COAD:

That's correct, Your Honor.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now that applies as I

12

recall to cases, or primarily to cases, in which there

13

has been a misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence,

14

is that correct?

15

MR. COAD:

It only applies in that instance.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

If your position

17

prevails, then Subsection (20), which applies to more

18

serious offenses, would in effect be held to provide for

19

a restoration when, in fact, nothing had been taken

20

away.

21

Whereas under (33), which applies simply to

22

a relatively minor set of crimes in relation to (20),

23

would not provide this relief.

24

anomaly that in the more serious cases, you would win.

25

In the less serious cases, you would lose, because the

So you would have the

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute was more onerous.

That's anomalous.

2

And my point is, and this is what I want you

3

to comment on, I'll assume for the sake of argument that

4

you're pointing out an anomaly here if you just look at

5

(20) alone.

6

your way, we're going to create another anomaly, the

7

other anomaly being that the more serious offense or the

8

more serious offender gets better treatment than the

9

less serious offender.

10
11
12

But if you look at (20) and (33), by going

So either way we go, there's going to be
some anomaly.

Am I right in reading it that way?

MR. COAD:

Well, in part.

Congress was

13

specific in 1996 when it enacted the Lautenberg

14

Amendment, which was the genesis for the (a)(33) and the

15

prohibition on firearms for misdemeanor crimes of

16

domestic violence, it was very -- Congress was very

17

specific that it thought those types of offenders were

18

particularly dangerous.

19

(a)(20), yes, it generally applies to felons and to

20

misdemeanors punishable by more than two years.

21

But in that group of people, you had varying

22

degrees of seriousness.

23

convictions -

24
25

Whereas when you look at

You could have embezzlement

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But none of them is less

serious in the classification of the crime than those
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

covered by 33, because 33 simply covers a misdemeanor of

2

domestic violence.

3

MR. COAD:

I think what we have to look to

4

here is Congress's clear choice in both.

In The

5

Firearms Owners' Protection Act for (a)(20), Congress

6

wanted to provide a broad exemption for individual

7

States deemed to be trustworthy.

8

Congress was legislating under a very different purpose,

9

which was to target misdemeanor crimes of domestic

Whereas in (a)(33),

10

violence as particularly dangerous offenders in relation

11

to gun possession.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but the State's

13

judgment about trustworthiness may very well be the same

14

in each case.

15

seems to me, is being -- would be applied differently in

16

the two cases if we take your position.

17

So the trustworthiness criterion, it

MR. COAD:

It is.

And I think that it is

18

okay for the Court to decide that because of the very

19

specific nature of only one type of offender in (a)(33),

20

which Congress decided they didn't want them to possess

21

guns.

22

Protection Act had a very different purpose.

23

expand gun ownership to even felons who States determine

24

to be otherwise trustworthy.

25

Whereas in (a)(20), The Firearms Owners'

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
12
Alderson Reporting Company

It was to

Isn't there another

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

difficulty for you in this statutory comparison that

2

Justice Souter has noted?

3

is that it would be absurd for Congress to take people,

4

exempt people, whose rights have been restored, but not

5

people whose rights were never taken away.

6

exactly what Congress did in (a)(33).

7

You're argument under (a)(20)

That is

So if Congress thought it was all right even

8

in albeit in a different context, it seems to me to be

9

very difficult to argue that it is inherently absurd to

10

do it somewhere else.

11

MR. COAD:

Our absurdity argument you've

12

identified for (a)(20) is more particular than that.

13

is when you look to a particular State, because again

14

we're in the realm here of delegation or at least

15

deferring to States this trustworthy judgment.

16

within a particular State that a less serious offender

17

as determined by that State ends up being punished more

18

harshly than its more serious offenders.

19

It is

Whereas in (a)(33) you don't run into that

20

problem.

21

There are varying States -- ways to -- States handle

22

these types of issues.

23

type of offender, and a State treats that offender in

24

one particular way.

25

You accept the anomalies amongst the States.

But with (a)(33) you have one

You aren't comparing State by State.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

It

We

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

don't look to Wisconsin versus Louisiana to see an

2

absurdity.

3

example, in Wisconsin to identify an absurdity.

4

certainly is an acceptance when Congress decided -

5

We look within a particular State, for

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There

Are you sure about that?

6

(33) applies to a number of different crimes, it seems

7

to me, within every State.

8

those crimes the civil rights are not taken away for

9

some of them, but are taken away for others?

10

MR. COAD:

Are you sure that in none of

The difference here, I think,

11

between (a)(20) and (a)(33) is that Congress was

12

legislating under the assumption for a felony you're

13

going to lose your civil rights.

14

Your Honor is correct.

15

punishable by nine months or up to a year, rights are

16

not lost.

17

Typically misdemeanors

And so I think that's the difference Your

18

Honor is getting to.

19

question.

20

Whereas in (a)(33)

I'm not sure if I answered the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, with respect to the

21

in-State anomaly that you were talking about, the

22

government argues on page 30 -- 29 and 30 of its brief

23

that there really are only a few States where this

24

exists, and even in those -- even in the States where it

25

exists, there are very significant restrictions on the
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ability of the felon to obtain restoration of civil

2

rights.

3

Is that incorrect?

4

MR. COAD:

I think it is incorrect in the

5

sense that when the government sort of narrowed the

6

number of States that we identified as being problem

7

States, what it ignores is that the Armed Career

8

Criminal Act and the prohibition against firearms goes

9

back forever really.

10

You have to look at all of State

law for 1980s, '70s '60s.

11

Now, the government argued, well, right now

12

there are only a handful of States.

That might be

13

correct for now.

14

years.

15

a deeper problem than the government identified.

But State laws have changed over the

And so, we have to look back farther.

So, it is

16

And I think what's key is that we're talking

17

about Congress separating dangerous offenders from those

18

who are otherwise considered trustworthy by a particular

19

State.

20

both Caron and in Small.

21

from the protections of the exemption clause offenders

22

for which a State has clearly identified as its most -

23

if you want to consider them its most trustworthy

24

offenders, that is absurd.

25

And this Court has recognized this principal in
And when you are excluding

And it certainly offends the societal norm
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that, all things being equal, we don't punish less

2

serious offenders more harshly than we do more serious

3

offenders.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, then, maybe the

5

problem was that Congress included misdemeanants who

6

were subject to over a two- year sentence.

7

The point has been made that, on your

8

reading, that was a futile gesture, or Congress did one

9

thing that was cancelled out by someone else, by another

10

provision.

11

misdemeanants who were subject to an over-two-year

12

sentence; but most of that group -- and in many states

13

all of them -- would not have their civil rights taken

14

away.

15
16
17
18
19

And then they put in this group of

So what is left of the group that was put
in, misdemeanants with over-two-year sentences?
MR. COAD:

I'm not sure I understand Your

Honor's question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What was the point of

20

putting that group in the statute as covered by the

21

Career Criminal Act?

22

MR. COAD:

Well, I -- I think the point is

23

that -- that we can't ignore Congress's clear intent to

24

exempt the -- the most trustworthy offenders in a -- in

25

a given State. And that's 16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But how many would be -

2

take a State that doesn't take civil rights away and gun

3

rights from misdemeanants.

4

What effect in that State would this

5

legislation have --

6

this legislation -- that says misdemeanants who are

7

subject to a two-year -- over-two-year term are covered?

8

It wouldn't be covered because the -- because they're

9

not having their civil rights taken away.

10

what effect would the provision of

MR. COAD:

Well, certainly, the Federal

11

statute set a two-year floor, if you will.

12

think that we should read the civil-rights-restored

13

exception in isolation.

14

Congress's choice to look to civil rights.

15

But I don't

I mean we have to make sense of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But does it make much

16

sense, as -- as Justice Ginsburg suggests, to read

17

(a)(20)(B) as covering almost nothing?

18

I mean, you know, why go to the trouble of

19

putting in that provision if it's only going to make a

20

difference in those -- in those very few States where -

21

well -

22

MR. COAD:

Well, we're talking about very

23

few States overall.

I mean even the problem we've

24

identified is certainly a limited one.

25

about a dozen States, at most.
17
Alderson Reporting Company

We're talking

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And so we can say, well, you know, it

2

vitiates (B) because only two States are left that fall

3

into (B).

4

restoration provision as applying to rights retained,

5

we're still only talking about a dozen States.

6

don't think that that necessarily vitiates (B).

7

But when we're talking about the civil rights

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I

You phrased

8

Congress's intent as allowing an exemption for people

9

the State has found trustworthy.

10

But I don't think

that's how this legislative process works.

11

You have additional punishment, and then

12

somebody says:

13

convicted of antitrust violations.

14

yeah.

15

Oh, let's not apply it to people who are

And then somebody says:

And you say:

Let's not apply it

16

to people whose civil rights have been restored.

17

they say:

18

Yeah,

And

Fine.
And then nobody pipes up and says:

Well,

19

let's not apply it to people whose civil rights were

20

never taken away.

21

In other words, it's not an intent that is

22

not effectuated.

23

reach more broadly.

24
25

It is just you want the intent to

MR. COAD:

I think that the intent was

broad, and Congress was operating under the assumption
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that rights would generally be lost for those serious

2

types of offenses that it thought it was covering in

3

(a)(20).

4

Congressional Record -

5

And I think there is no evidence in the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's based on a

6

congressional mistake, in other words, about the

7

breadth, but it still doesn't -

8
9

MR. COAD:

It is an unthought-of application

of the statute that -- that leads to absurd results,

10

And it's -- and it's absurd to conclude that a

offenders avoid the Federal ban, it would have to treat

them more harshly than it currently does in order for

12

those offenders to be treated better under Federal law.

13

And I think that that's an absurd notion.

And I also -- I think -- I just want to give

one what I think is the most clear example, which is the

19

We're not talking about

We're talking about felony

In North Dakota the State has decided that

20

if a felon is not sentenced to imprisonment, then the

21

felon retains his civil rights, and his right to possess

22

a firearm is restored after a short waiting period.

23

Whereas, a felon who is convicted to -- and

24

sent to prison, his rights are taken away and later

25

restored.

So we have the result here of the complete
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

opposite of what North Dakota intended, which is to

2

treat the less serious offender accordingly and treat

3

the more serious offender accordingly.

4

And that's directly contrary to Congress's

5

purpose in passing a firearm owner's protection act,

6

which was in direct response to this Court's holding in

7

Dickerson, which ignored a State's expungement of -- of

8

a conviction, which, again, is another way of a State

9

identifying an individual as trustworthy.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you know, since you

11

seem to have looked at it:

12

person whose had his civil rights taken away, is -- is

13

there any mechanism to get them back earlier by -- by

14

applying for clemency or a pardon or -

15

MR. COAD:

In North Carolina, for the

In North Dakota --

in North

to check, but I think -

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'd have

That would be about the

only way?
MR. COAD:

Yes.

And so you're talking about

21

requiring less serious offenders to seek, in some

22

instances, extraordinary relief in order to get on the

23

same footing as more serious offenders.

24

And I -- and I would look to point to the

25

example of Wisconsin and the offenses, in particular,
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that we're talking about here.

2

For a misdemeanor crime as a repeat

3

offender, before 2003, it was punishable by up to three

4

years.

5

only punishable by two years.

6

under (b).

Now Wisconsin has changed that law, and it is

7

So it would be exempt

But Wisconsin allows that type of offender

8

to retain civil rights and to retain the rights to

9

possess a firearm.

And, yet, under the government's

10

reading and the Seventh Circuit's reading the Federal

11

statute would ignore that determination by the State and

12

would impose the ban on that individual and require that

13

individual to get on the same footing as a felon to

14

receive a pardon, which are generally not available to

15

misdemeanants but are readily available to -- to felons.

16

And so you are talking about a less serious

17

offender having to seek extraordinary remedies under

18

State laws -- and this, I think, is not just unique to

19

the State of Wisconsin -- in order to put themselves on

20

the same footing as a more serious offender as

21

identified by that State.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL JOSEFFER

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4
5

MR. JOSEFFER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We just have a two points.

The first is

6

that restoring a right does not mean leaving it alone,

7

and the second is that the statute is not absurd.

8

for those reasons, Petitioner's prior offenses are

9

violent felonies under the meaning of the act.

And

10

The statute is clear on point.

11

"restored," and restoring a right means giving back a

12

right that has been taken away.

13

leaving a right alone.

14

have different meanings in contexts, we are aware of no

15

context in which "restore" was "leave alone."

16

It says

It does not mean

And though words can sometimes

And this is certainly not such a context

17

because the statute refers to a pardon, a set-aside, an

18

expungement, or a restoration of rights.

19

thing that those four items all have in common is that

20

there are ways which a State essentially undoes its

21

conviction by relieving a defendant of some or all of

22

the consequences of that conviction.

23

And the one

Giving back rights that have been taken away

24

as part of the conviction has that effect.

25

leaving the rights alone does not.
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Simply

And for that reason,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

because the statute is so clear, the only question in

2

this case is whether the scope of the statutory

3

exemption is so absurd that this Court should take the

4

liberty to amend it in order to add an additional

5

exemption for defendants who never lost their civil

6

rights in the first place.

Congress's comprehension.

results in a closely analogous statute.

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, that's true, but my

point is just that on the face of the domestic violence
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute, and what it says is that the restoration of

2

rights exception is limited to circumstances where the

3

law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss

4

of civil rights.

5

the provision says restoration occurs only if civil

6

rights have been lost.

7

Congress was saying there was it was mandating the

8

allegedly absurd result here in situations where rights

9

were not lost.

10
11
12
13
14

So on the face of that provision -

So it's clear as day that what

And what that means is that you can't say
that it's impossible that Congress JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There are cases in the

pipeline that don't think it's as clear as day.
MR. JOSEFFER:

There is -- in the context of

15

subsection (33) -- in the context of the domestic

16

violence misdemeanor provision -

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

MR. JOSEFFER:

Yes.

-- there is one circuit that

19

has applied -- that has basically overlooked the plain

20

language there, not even attempted to deal with the

21

plain language there.

22

that that exemption was somehow satisfied in a situation

23

where civil rights were never taken away or restored.

24

But the fact that, you know, a court of appeals reached

25

that conclusion without even attempting to take a look

And it's true, and it's found

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

at the statutory language doesn't diminish the very

2

plain meaning -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. JOSEFFER: -- of the statutory language.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6
7

that?

What court -

What court of appeals was

I didn't get that.
MR. JOSEFFER:

It was the Sixth Circuit in

8

the Burgin case, I believe it's called.

And the Sixth

9

Circuit there, similar to the First Circuit in

10

construing this statute, was very clear that it was just

11

skipping the language and doing what it thought Congress

12

would have wanted to do if it had thought about it.

13

But the plain language in the domestic

14

violence provision is unmistakable because it expressly

15

refers to civil rights -

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

If Congress thought about

17

the problem, what reason could they have for saying that

18

the firearms ban should apply to someone who never lost

19

his or her civil rights, but not -- but would not apply

20

to someone who had civil rights restored?

21

Automatically, let's say.

22

short period of time.

23

be for doing that?

24
25

Automatically and within a

What rationale reason could there

MR. JOSEFFER:

The reason is that Congress

was balancing two policies.

On the one hand, what it

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was looking to do in this provision was to defer to a

2

State's decision to essentially undo its conviction.

3

And that applies where rights have been taken away and

4

restored, but does not have anything to do with rights

5

being left alone.

6

On the other hand, and a couple of Justices

7

already made this point as well, Congress wanted to

8

apply the Federal firearms disability to serious

9

felonies, to felonies punishable by more than two years

10

of imprisonment, but if Congress had included a

11

retention of rights exemption, that would have all but

12

gutted the statutory prohibition on serious

13

misdemeanants possessing firearms.

14

consistent with Congress's desire to get tough on

15

firearms and impose the firearms disability on serious

16

felons, it couldn't include a retention of rights

17

exemption.

18

And that's why,

So it's a situation where Congress had a

19

couple of different policies.

It clearly pursued both

20

of them, and as a result, there is a seam, there is this

21

anomaly that Petitioners have pointed to, but that's an

22

inevitable consequence of Congress's desire to balance

23

these two policies.

24

and probably foreseen result of Congress's intent, it

25

doesn't call Congress's intent into question.

And because that's an inevitable

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

In addition, the scope of the anomalies here

2

is really quite minor.

3

according to its plain language, there are a few States

4

in which the Petitioner -- the anomaly the Petitioner

5

points to occurs.

6

It used to be about six States.

7

There are -- if you -- read

It's currently about three States.

On the other hand, if you take Petitioner's

8

view, you create anomaly in a couple other States, which

9

Justice Ginsburg referred to, whereby the most serious

10

offenders, first-degree murderers, would not be treated

11

as having their civil rights restored.

12

But in all of these States, the effect of

13

the anomaly is greatly reduced by the firearms exception

14

to the restoration of rights exemption because in -

15

Petitioner's example was North Carolina, where he said

16

that a more serious offender would be able to get

17

firearms rights back promptly.

18

"shortly" was that the offender could get them back 10

19

years after completing the sentence if he had not

20

committed further crimes.

21

I guess what he meant by

So the incidence of this issue is really not

22

very significant.

Instead, the real significance to

23

departing from the plain statutory language would be to

24

gut the statute as applied to misdemeanors punishable by

25

tiers of imprisonment, which is contrary to Congress's
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

clearly expressed intent by including such misdemeanors

2

within the scope of the statute.

3

Petitioner has also argued at length that

4

what Congress was looking at here was trustworthiness.

5

Did the State find the defendant trustworthy to possess

6

firearms?

7

Caron, that that's not what this provision goes to

8

because the whole point of the Federal firearms laws is

9

to prohibit firearms possession in some circumstances

10
11

But we know, and this Court explained in

where at least some States were permitting it.
So the fact that a State would let a person

12

possess firearms is not relevant here.

Instead,

13

Congress was not deferring generally to the States'

14

trustworthiness views but instead was looking to defer

15

to their specific determination to essentially undo

16

their own conviction.

17

conviction, Congress was willing to give effect to that,

18

but that's the only thing it was deferring to.

If a State wanted to undo its own

19

And it also bears emphasis that Congress -

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

I can understand that

21

argument where there's an individualized determination

22

about each -- each defendant, but I don't quite

23

understand it when it's a blanket restoration of rights.

24

MR. JOSEFFER:

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Right.

That's -

It's a formal difference
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

matter.

There's no substance to it, is there?

2

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, there's still substance

3

to the fact that rights were, in fact, taken away and

4

were, in fact, restored, as opposed to someone having

5

his rights all the time.

6

substantive legal difference there, but as a practical

7

matter, I mean one reason that Congress may have decided

8

not to distinguish between automatic and individualized

9

restorations of rights is simply that it didn't want to

There's certainly a

10

attempt to micromanage the States in how they would go

11

about choosing to do a pardon or a restoration of

12

rights.

I mean -- and -- with respect to restoration or

13

rights.

MR. JOSEFFER:

7

Not murderers, I assume?

No, that's In fact, this practice is

enshrined in the Louisiana Constitution.
But in any event, I think the point is just

8

that Congress was going to defer to the States' decision

9

to effectively undo their convictions, but was not going

10

to micromanage how the States did it.

11

one might determine from that point of view is that if

12

you think that Congress was really thinking about an

13

individualized determination, then what that would mean

14

is that some offenders who get automatic restorations

15

are currently essentially catching a break from the fact

16

that they got an automatic one.

17

plain language of the statute may give someone of the

18

offenders a break is no reason to depart from the plain

19

language of the statute, to give other offenders a break

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And in the automatic

category, I take it, it's usually after the sentence has

MR. JOSEFFER:

There's some variance.

In

So there's an

10

again underscores why anomalies are inevitable, and

11

therefore don't really call Congress's intention into

12

question.

13

But the standard practice is that after a

14

defendant has finished serving his sentence, and that

15

would include not just maybe one day in jail but also

16

the probationary period following that -- but after the

17

defendant has finished serving his sentence, if

18

restoration is automatic, it will either be at the

19

conclusion of the sentence or at some time period

20

thereafter, which in some instances can be significantly

21

thereafter.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

At any time in

23

consideration of these statutes did Congress consider,

24

to your knowledge, perhaps making the test be the length

25

of the actual sentence served rather than eligibility
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for -- it seems to me one normal way of differentiating

2

between those who are most trustworthy and those less

3

trustworthy would be by looking at the actual sentence

4

served.

5

MR. JOSEFFER:

I think that's true.

I guess

6

there are two parts to that.

One is that, I mean, the

7

provisions at issue here about the length of sentence

8

served, were in the statute before this amendment was

9

made.

They were in the statute before 1986.

So they're

10

not directly relevant to the intent of the '86 Congress.

11

But I'm not aware of -- I mean, of legislative history

12

predating 1986 in which Congress looked at the length as

13

opposed to the maximum term.

14

reflects is that what Congress was not doing here was

15

just looking to defer to the States' trustworthiness

16

determinations as this Court explained in Caron.

whole point of this law was to get tougher on gun crime

than many of the States were at the time.
