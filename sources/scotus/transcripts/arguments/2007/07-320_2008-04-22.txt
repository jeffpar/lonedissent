Mr. Herman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW D. HERMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

9
10

MR. HERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

11

This case involves the constitutional

12

question of whether the government may regulate the

13

personal spending of a candidate on behalf of his own

14

campaign.

15

political expression at the core of the First Amendment,

16

yet BCRA Section 319 seeks to deter and, failing that,

17

penalizes such protected political expression.

18

this Court finds that the harms upon speech of Section

19

319 are modest, the provision still fails to satisfy any

20

constitutional standard.

21

governmental purpose and conversely increases the undue

22

influence of contributions upon Federal candidates.

23

This is an activity that constitutes

Even if

It furthers no legitimate

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There is no

24

restriction whatsoever on the wealthier candidate.

25

can spend as much of his money as he wants.
3
Alderson Reporting Company

He

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. HERMAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

2

The harm from Section 319 is that he is burdened from

3

the beginning of his campaign throughout every step with

4

the knowledge that any time he spends money he is going

5

to be providing his opponent with an advantage; he is

6

going to be enhancing his opponent's speech.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what if, for

8

example, somebody takes out a television ad that says

9

smoking this type of cigarette is actually, is not

10

harmful to you.

The government is free to take out a

11

contrary ad saying, no, it is and so you shouldn't do

12

it, right?

13

MR. HERMAN:

Of course, Mr. Chief Justice.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So governmental

15

responses to the exercise of free speech are not

16

automatically -- don't automatically burden the exercise

17

of that speech.

18
19
20

MR. HERMAN:

That is absolutely correct,

Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well then, why does

21

it burden it for the government to make it easier for

22

private citizens to respond to that speech.

23

MR. HERMAN:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it's

24

making it easier for a self-financed candidate's

25

opponent to respond to that speech.
4
Alderson Reporting Company

In essence, what

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Section 319 says is, we are going to make it easier for

2

your opponent to beat you.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

government respond to political speech?

5

can have a position on smoking cigarettes, it can have a

6

position on a lot of things, but can it have a position

7

on whether the Republican Party or the Democratic Party

8

should win the next election?

9

MR. HERMAN:

11

Mr. Herman, can the

Absolutely not, Justice Scalia.

Isn't that a distinction

here?

that proposition?

15
16

The government

MR. HERMAN:

Your Honor, Buckley is on --

there is not anything --

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How is the government

22

speaking?

You have already acknowledged that the

23

wealthy candidate can spend as much as he or she wants

24

and the end result of this scheme is that there will be

25

more, not less, speech because the non-affluent opponent
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

will now have money to spend that he didn't have before.

2

So I think you have to concede that overall the scheme

3

will produce more political speech, not less.

4

MR. HERMAN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I can't

5

concede that, and this is the reason why.

6

319 operates as it's intended to, it will deter

7

self-financed candidates from ever reaching that

8

$350,000 threshold and triggering the, quote unquote,

9

"more speech."

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Has it done it?

I mean,

we do have some experience under the statute now.

13
14

What it is really designed to do at

every single step --

11
12

If Section

MR. HERMAN:

We have very little experience

under the statute, Justice --

your client's latest filing that he intended to spend a

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20

MR. HERMAN:

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I think that's --

That is correct.
So it didn't deter him.

22

You're in the position in which it clearly didn't deter

23

your client.

25

evidence that it's deterring anybody else.

4

Well, Justice Souter, in fact
If you look at his election in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do we usually evaluate

5

restrictions on First Amendment rights on the basis of

6

whether the chill that was imposed by the government was

7

actually effective in stifling the right?

8

MR. HERMAN:

No, Your Honor.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If the person goes ahead

10

and speaks anyway, is he estopped from saying that the

11

government was chilling his speech nonetheless?

12

MR. HERMAN:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

Absolutely not, Justice Scalia.
Isn't that's what's going

on here?

15

MR. HERMAN:

Absolutely.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Don't we expect a chill

17

argument to at least have a ring of plausibility?

18

your chill argument is that it is deterring.

19

deter your client.

20

deter anybody else and I have to say I don't see why it

21

would.

22

And

It didn't

There is no indication that it would

MR. HERMAN:

Justice Souter, respectfully, I

23

don't think that you can categorically say that it did

24

not deter my client when he was outspent by $3 million

25

in that campaign.

As he went through the campaign

against his -JUSTICE SOUTER:

You mean if the -- if the

3

other side had not had an enhanced spending capacity,

4

your client would then have spent $2 million?

5
6
7

MR. HERMAN:

Your Honor, he actually did

spend $2 million.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Whatever it is, I mean are

8

you saying that if the -- if the client -- if the

9

opposing party had not had an enhanced spending capacity

10

your client would have spent even more?

11

MR. HERMAN:

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13
14

Potentially.

Potentially.

That seems to substantiate

the, at least the ostensible basis for this statute.
MR. HERMAN:

Your Honor, if the basis for

15

the statute is to, quote unquote, "level the playing

16

field," to equalize the candidates, I haven't received

17

an explanation from the government or from the district

18

court that explains how a statute designed to do that

19

would have allowed my client's opponent to have raised

20

another $1.4 million even though he had already outspent

21

my opponent by $3 million.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is there any reason to think

23

that this statute will have any greater or different

24

effect of Mr. Davis in the upcoming election than it did

25

in the last election?
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. HERMAN:

There is, Justice Alito.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

3

MR. HERMAN:

Why?

Because his incumbent opponent

4

from the last two elections has announced his retirement

5

and so Mr. Davis will now be facing very likely primary

6

challengers, and then if he were to prevail in the

7

primary he'll be meeting a non-incumbent challenger in

8

the general election as well.

9

So it's an open seat.

And again, one of the great deficiencies of

10

319 is that it fails to take into account any of the

11

advantages of incumbency, not just the financial

12

advantages but the inherent advantage that each and

13

every incumbent brings to an election when he or she

14

runs for re-election, the fact that the incumbent has

15

much greater status as --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The government says that in

17

fact more and quite a bit more incumbents went over the

18

$350,000 personal funding limits than non-incumbents.

19

Something like -- I don't know, 14-2 or something like

20

that in the last election, is that right?

21

MR. HERMAN:

First of all, the statistics

22

here are incomplete because basically the briefing in

23

this case was concluded in early September of 2006,

24

before a lot of primaries occurred for the 2006 House

25

election.

And so I think referring to those numbers -9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the FEC has never -- we've never received any additional

2

numbers for the effect, but --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it was a four-year

4

record and the numbers are rather startling that -- is

5

it 110 senators or representatives qualified for the

6

enhanced contributions and only 6 of them were

7

incumbents?

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. HERMAN:

Yes.

The other number that was cited

10

is that only 2 of 60 incumbents actually triggered the

11

Millionaires' Amendment in those --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, that could mean

13

that the millionaires have already been elected and are

14

now pulling up the ladder after them.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. HERMAN:

17

That's certainly our argument,

Justice Scalia.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Right.
Well, if that's so, one

20

of the reasons that has been given for this statute is

21

that it encourages the parties to favor the wealthier

22

candidates; it deters people who are non-affluent but

23

highly meritorious.

24

perception that the seats in our Congress are there to

25

be bought by the wealthiest bidder.

So -- and it gives the public the

10
Alderson Reporting Company

And if there's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

anything to that -- well, do you reject that out of hand

2

as what the statute is all about?

3

MR. HERMAN:

Justice Ginsburg, I believe

4

that the -- the fact that the statute expands the

5

supposedly anti-corruptive $2300 to $6900 and allows a

6

national party to make coordinated communications of an

7

unlimited amount in response to the, what Buckley called

8

"ameliorative speech" by a self-financer, would also

9

increase the perception that -- that our candidates are

10

there to be bought.

11

had sat down and read all of this Court's jurisprudence

12

before he decided to run, he wouldn't have seen a word

13

in there about leveling the playing field.

14

It seems to me that if Mr. Davis

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I thought -- I

15

thought your brief -- and correct me if I'm wrong --

16

said at one stage that there is -- what Congress was

17

driving at is a valid concern, but there are less

18

restrictive alternatives.

19

those less restrictive alternatives were.

20

MR. HERMAN:

And I was trying to find what

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I can

21

think of one off the top of my head which is not this

22

case, and that's public funding.

23

concerned about providing a boost to minor party

24

candidates who may not be able to raise the $2300 to

25

begin with, much less take advantage of the benefits of

If Congress were truly

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

319, or wanted to boost self-financed candidates who,

2

say, like Mr. DeRossett in the amicus brief, in his

3

amicus brief, who mortgaged his house or others who have

4

encumbered their pensions and raised $350,000 or

5

$400,000 and then triggered the amendment, if they

6

wanted to foster all of those people of modest means to

7

participate, then the easiest way and the way sanctioned

8

by this Court in Buckley is to institute a public

9

funding system and allow them to choose.

They can raise

10

private funds if they'd like; they could do it

11

personally with their own money; or they could take

12

whatever amount that the -- that the State was willing

13

to give them --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that wouldn't level the

15

playing field.

I mean, the other side, the millionaire,

16

won't take the public funding and he'll spend his

17

millions and whoever gets the public funding -- or are

18

you saying the public funding should match whatever the

19

other side pays?

20

MR. HERMAN:

No, Your Honor --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. HERMAN:

Well then --

But this Court's analysis in

23

Buckley -- the public funding analysis in Buckley does

24

not center on leveling the playing field or providing

25

equality for all candidates.

It --

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you think that's a valid

constitutional objective, to level the playing field?

3

MR. HERMAN:

I --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you think we should

5

trust our incumbent senators and representatives to

6

level the playing field for us?

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. HERMAN:

9

Absolutely not, Justice Scalia.

And there's a reason why there's a distinction between

10

an anti-corruptive purpose and a

11

leveling-the-playing-field purpose.

12

legislates to deal with the actuality or appearance of

13

corruption, they are legislating uniformly and they're

14

not taking an interest in the outcome, in the

15

competitiveness.

16

the playing field, one of the players on that playing

17

field are incumbent members of Congress.

18

saying that we're going to trust basketball players not

19

-- to call their own out-of-bounds plays.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When Congress

When they are talking about leveling

It's like

But isn't there something

21

different between what the statute was at the time of

22

Buckley, that a lid on, you can't spend more than X

23

amount of money, and a statute that says we're going to

24

let you spend, the sky is the limit for you, but we're

25

going to give a boost to your opponent?
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. HERMAN:

Justice Ginsburg, in Buckley

2

there -- there was no lid on personal expenditures.

3

Court struck down that aspect of Buckley and upheld the

4

public funding provision.

5

The

So the Court was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm talking about the

6

statute as it was originally enacted by Congress did

7

have expenditure limits and this Court said that was no

8

good.

9

doesn't put a lid on the candidates self-financing.

10

This statute doesn't have that problem because it

MR. HERMAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

11

But -- but again, if you're going to make a comparison

12

to the public funding system in Buckley that was

13

approved by this Court, that system was indifferent to

14

the -- the source or the amount of funds.

15

said there -- or the equality -- that that statute was

16

indifferent to whether the playing field was level.

17

-- all Buckley said and all Congress said in enacting

18

the public funding was we want to take the allegedly

19

corruptive private funds out of the system, and we want

20

to replace it with public funds and --

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

All the Court

All

Even if -- even if leveling

22

the playing field is not generally a compelling or maybe

23

even a permissible interest, is it a stronger interest

24

when one of the reasons why the playing field is not

25

level is other action that Congress has taken?
14
Alderson Reporting Company

If there

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

weren't expenditure limits, then self-financed

2

candidates wouldn't perhaps have as much of an advantage

3

as they do.

4

contribution limits are constitutional, it -- does that

5

provide a basis for Congress to try to rectify at least

6

in part what it itself has done by imposing the

7

contribution limits?

8

So if we accept the world in which

MR. HERMAN:

Justice Alito, leveling the

9

playing field is -- I'm not quite sure how Congress

10

would start to do that without implicating their own

11

interest.

12

playing field, Congress has to look at the whole playing

13

field.

14

to other people and not talk about their interest in

15

leveling the playing field.

16

difficult road to go down.

17

When you say that you're going to level the

They can't just carve out a section that applies

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think it's a very

What we're talking about in

18

leveling the playing field, I guess, is leveling the

19

amount of speech that each side has, to make sure that

20

each side has the same amount of speech.

21

that what's going on here?

22

MR. HERMAN:

Is that -- is

Well, it's an attempt to do

23

that.

And again, in Buckley this Court said that --

24

that Congress has no interest in determining whether

25

speech is excessive or unwise or wasteful.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

That's --

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that's ultimately the purview for the voters, and that's

2

really the fallacy in 319 at its heart, is there's no

3

such thing as secret self-funders.

4

everything that they do is disclosed in the same way

5

that all other expenditures and contributions are

6

disclosed in quarterly and pre-election reports.

7

Certainly, in many cases, their opponents are going to

8

make the case that this wealthy person is out of touch,

9

they don't represent the district, your vote is not to

determination on what kind of candidate they want.

12

And then ultimately the voters will have the

15

$350,000, isn't it?

16

Are we -- are we talking

What's the average price of a home

MR. HERMAN:

I think it's a good deal above

It certainly is in this area

17

and in many congressional districts in the United

18

States.

19

This provision affects less -- about a quarter of what

20

it costs to run a competitive race in 2006.

21

certainly it's not as if Congress said, well, if you

22

spend some disproportionate amount of money to a

23

congressional race, if you go ten times over what it

24

should cost, we're going to step in.

25

And that's a very good point, Justice Scalia.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
16
Alderson Reporting Company

So

They said -You don't think that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would be any more constitutional than this, do you?

2

MR. HERMAN:

I think it would be equally

3

unconstitutional, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

talking about the tailoring of the statute, I think that

5

that is certainly something that's relevant.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But if you're

I'd like to ask about the

7

provisions of the statute which allow the candidate who

8

doesn't have the personal funds -- what was the name of

9

the challenger in this case?

10

MR. HERMAN:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

Tom Reynolds.

MR. HERMAN:

He can receive up to 100

percent of whatever that OPFA number is -- the --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. HERMAN:

17
18

Reynolds -- - to receive,

is it, unlimited contributions from his own party?

13
14

Not Davis -- Reynolds?

Yes.

-- the purported difference in

funds.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose you had a statute

19

which either explicitly said or has the effect, as this

20

does, that the less wealthy challenger, the challenger

21

in Reynolds' position, has more access and more support

22

from his party than the challenger does from his party?

23

What is your best case that indicates that that is

24

unconstitutional, and what is your argument that that is

25

unconstitutional?
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. HERMAN:

I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy?

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That concerns me in this.

3

What is your best argument that differential treatment

4

of the candidates vis-a-vis support from their

5

respective parties is unconstitutional?

6

MR. HERMAN:

Well, again, Your Honor, if

7

you're making a distinction -- when you talk about the

8

--

9
10
11
12
13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The statute makes that

distinction.
MR. HERMAN:

Well, the statute talks about

the less wealthy candidate.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it seems to me that

14

that distinction is somewhat questionable, and I'm

15

asking you for your best statement of the theory as to

16

why it's unconstitutional and your best case to show

17

that it's unconstitutional.

18

MR. HERMAN:

The best argument, Justice

19

Kennedy, is that money and speech are synonymous in an

20

electoral context, and it's inappropriate for the

21

government to say that you, as the purportedly wealthier

22

candidate, have too much speech; that that's enough

23

speech from you.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
to the statute generally.

But you make that argument

Is there any more specific
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

argument that you can make in the context of the less

2

well-funded candidate having more support from the party

3

than the well-funded candidate had?

4

MR. HERMAN:

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well -It seems to me that that's

6

a particular vice of the statute, and I want to know if

7

there is a formulation that's more precise than the

8

general attack that you made -- that you make.

9

MR. HERMAN:

10

I --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could you clarify with

11

respect to that question two things:

12

at liberty to give anything it wants.

13

that it would be -- it's tied to that formula.

14

wealthy person could still have a lot more to spend.

15

But the party also is -- there's no obligation of the

16

party to give one cent to anybody that it doesn't choose

17

to give money to; is that right?

18

MR. HERMAN:

The party is not

No, Justice Ginsburg.

So the

course, the party would have to make a determination if

20

they felt that this person was --

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the party for the less

22

well-funded candidate has the option to have much closer

23

ties, much greater involvement, than the party for the

24

other candidate; and that seems to me highly

25

problematic.

And I want to know the best case that you

Alderson Reporting Company

1

have for that proposition and the best statement of law

2

that can you give me for why that is unconstitutional.

3

MR. HERMAN:

Well, Justice Kennedy, if you

4

refer to Colorado II, where this Court talked about the

5

facts that -- where this Court upheld limitations on

6

party, unlimited party- coordinated communications,

7

because that -- allowing the party to do so would raise

8

the possibility of evading the contribution limits.

9

so accordingly they upheld the 42 -- the $42,000 limit

10
11

And

on coordinated communication.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, you said

12

earlier that money is -- money is speech in this area.

13

So I take it you think that the restrictions, otherwise

14

applicable restrictions on the less wealthy candidate,

15

raise problems under the First Amendment?

16

MR. HERMAN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

those problematic restrictions.

20

MR. HERMAN:

So this law eases

It's less violative of

It is less violative of the

21

First Amendment, but, again, this Court has made the

22

distinction between contribution limits, which it found

23

was a reasonable burden on the Constitution, and

24

expenditure limits, which -- which are not.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This --

It doesn't limit those

It does not limit the

to?

Don't those limits on contributions continue to

2

MR. HERMAN:

The contribution limits apply

to him as they would to any other candidate except for

his opponent.

He cannot have the same level

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Not the same level of

12

MR. HERMAN:

That's correct.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And is party support

14

sometimes important in an election?

MR. HERMAN:

Of course, it can be vital in

the party's decision as to how they feel about the

candidate's positions.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, but they certainly

can allocate funds more generously to one candidate than

another; can't they?

5

MR. HERMAN:

They certainly have that

6

opportunity, but under -- under a limit, under the

7

$42,000 limit, as opposed to essentially an infinite

8

limit when you're dealing with a self- funded candidate.

9

And incidentally, Justice Stevens, to

10

address something else that you just brought up, for

11

many self-financed candidates the fact that they don't

12

take money from their party or from donors or from PACs

13

is a significant issue for them in their campaign.

mean certainly for Mr. Davis, the fact that he is

15

independent and can make his own determinations --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I

than the millionaire, right?

18

MR. HERMAN:

He is the ultimate independent.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

(Laughter.)

21

MR. HERMAN:

The ultimate incorruptible.

You cannot corrupt yourself.

22

And, again, the voters will get to decide whether they

23

want someone who is like that or they want someone who

24

is more in tune with, say, what the party wants or with

25

what his donors want.

I mean, that's really the essence

of our -- of our electoral system.

The parties are certainly interested in

Mr. Chief Justice, they are

interested in those candidates only inasmuch as they get

10

elected.

The moment that the public turns on them, they

MR. HERMAN:

I apologize.

Let me just add -- let me just

22

add one other thing.

The government's own experts, all

23

of their information is derived from an individual who

24

is quoted as saying that self- financed candidates

25

rarely win, and when they do, it's usually for some
24

other reason.

The fact of the matter is they don't

always make great candidates because they're not within

the mainstream.

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT

9

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

10
11

Thank you,

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

12

Appellant's claim here is an odd sort of

13

First Amendment complaint.

14

Section 319 has limited his own spending at all.

15

fact, he has twice spent a substantial amount of his own

16

money in excess of the statutory triggers.

17
18

He does not suggest that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In

It has penalized his own

spending.

19

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well -- and we can talk

20

about that as well, but I think it's worth recognizing

21

that his own spending is unlimited both in theory and in

22

fact.

23

this next time around to spend even more of his own

24

money.

25

his experience is not atypical in this regard.

And, if anything, he has announced his intent

And the other thing that I think is relevant is

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That just means he is

2

willing to accept the penalty in the next election even

3

if this case doesn't come out in his favor.

4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

Well, Justice Scalia -It doesn't prove that it

isn't a penalty.

7

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I don't think in any

8

way it's a penalty.

9

it as a penalty you have to accept the proposition that

10

you start out with a constitutional entitlement to speak

11

freely without the opportunity for the other side to

12

respond, and I don't think the Constitution recognizes

13

this.

14

And I think in order to understand

This isn't a context where they forced the

15

Appellant to pay for the other side's speech, as in

16

Tornillo, or carry the speech, as in PG&E.

17

think it's fair to look at the record here and suggest

18

that what Congress was trying to do here was actually

19

limit or deter self-financing.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I don't

Well, isn't there something

21

very -- isn't there something very strange about having

22

different contribution limits for candidates in an

23

election?

24

Congress to say that the -- the contribution limits for

25

incumbents is X, but for challengers it's 2X or one-half

Do you think it would be constitutional for

26
Alderson Reporting Company

1

X?

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I think 2X would be

3

constitutional.

4

surprised if Congress passed the statute that gave more

5

generous contribution limits to challengers, but I think

6

it would be a perfectly appropriate regime because it

7

would recognize that incumbents have certainly built-in

8

advantages such that the relatively low hard money

9

contribution caps have a greater influence, greater

And I think most people would be

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You think that's really a

election?

15

eloquent than the other one?

16

pebbles in his mouth or what?

What if some -- one candidate is more

17

(Laughter.)

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

You make him talk with

Justice Scalia, I think

19

there's an important distinction that was suggested in

20

one of Justice Alito's question, between the government

21

trying to level the playing field in the abstract and

22

the government looking out, not at the eloquence of

23

candidates, but at its own campaign finance regime after

24

this Court's decision and recognizing that, look, the

25

differential -27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the campaign finance

2

regimes we've approved up to now, the significant

3

limitations, have had an anti-corruption rationale.

4

There is no anti-corruption rationale here.

5

purpose of this is to level the playing field.

6

deeply suspicious of allowing elections to be conducted

7

under a regime whereby Congress levels the playing

8

field.

9

The only
And I am

That seems to be very dangerous.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, again, Justice

10

Scalia, though, you start with the anti-corruption

11

rationale that underlies the hard money contribution

12

caps.

13

Buckley and after this Court said that a candidate's

14

ability to self-finance is unlimited, it's recognized

15

that in a subset of elections where somebody is going to

16

spend an awful lot of their own money to self-finance,

17

the ordinary hard money contribution caps are going to

18

have a potentially skewing effect.

19

And what Congress has recognized is that after

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's not just money.

It's

20

not just money.

It's the quality and kind of speech.

21

You're saying, the government is saying, the statute

22

says, that the underfunded candidate has less access to

23

coordinated expenditures with the party than -- than the

24

other party -- than the other candidate.

25

have acknowledge, the statute acknowledges, that
28
Alderson Reporting Company

And the cases

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

coordinated expenditures have a particularly potent

2

force, and you are saying candidates are treated

3

differently in the access to this kind of speech.

4

And I know of no precedent of this Court

5

that says one party is entitled to assistance from a

6

certain segment and another party is not, based on

7

the -- the content of the speech.

8

what this is.

9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And that's exactly

Well, Justice Kennedy,

10

what I would say is, if you analogize to a system where

11

Congress decided that because of the advantage that

12

incumbents have, there is a greater scope for

13

coordination of the party with the challengers, I would

14

certainly be here defending that statute.

15

I would like to make clear, though, Justice

16

Kennedy, in fairness, that this focus on the coordinated

17

expenditures of the parties has really not been the

18

focus of Appellant's challenge in this case.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it's in the statute

20

and it's part of the challenge.

21

given a relatively minor position, but it's of great

22

concern to me because it puts this Court, it puts this

23

statute, in the position of preferring one kind of

24

speech over another.

25

I agree that it's been

And we simply do not do that.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kennedy, let

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

me say two things about the fact that this was not the

2

gravamen of the challenge here, because one reason I

3

think that's clear is if you look at the record here, at

4

the point that the record closed in this case no party

5

had taken advantage of that coordinated expenditures

6

provision.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are you saying that

8

argument is not properly before us when we are judging

9

the validity of the statute that's been challenged?

10

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I'm saying that this

11

record would not allow you to invalidate the statute on

12

that ground.

13

should -- there was no time that a party had taken

14

advantage of that.

15

the record, but I understand after the record closed

16

there were some coordinated expenditures.

17

The record at the time that it closed

Now, I understand that it's outside

But another thing I would certainly want to

18

know before I considered that challenge, Justice

19

Kennedy, is whether this particular Appellant had

20

coordinated expenditures from his own party up to the

21

limit, because we know as a general matter that there

22

is -- parties will fund different candidates differently

23

or may fund --

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the provisions --

25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- some and not others.

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The provisions of the law

2

which prefers one candidate over the other with respect

3

to coordinated expenditures has an impact on campaign

4

strategy.

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, again, Justice

6

Kennedy, in fairness, though, I mean, one would expect

7

if that were the nature of the claim, that at a minimum

8

we would know two facts that I don't know, aren't in the

9

record.

One is whether or not his candidate reached the

10

cap from his party's coordinated expenditures, because

11

if he didn't I don't see why that individual would have

12

standing.

13
14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Solicitor General,

you're defending this statute on its face, I take it.

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I am defending --

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it seems to me that

17
18

this is a facial invalidity of substantial proportions.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kennedy, I

19

always thought it was harder to bring a facial

20

challenge, not easier to bring a facial challenge.

21

I realized that we relaxed the normal rules about

22

as-applied challenges in the First Amendment context,

23

but I think there has to be a limit to that, too.

24

think in a case where we don't know the fundamental

25

facts that at least I'd want to know before even
31
Alderson Reporting Company

And

And I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

evaluating that challenge, I think it would be bad for

2

us to invalidate the statute, it would be wrong for us

3

to invalidate the statute on those grounds.

4

I would still be here defending it.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I think

--

I thought that that's what

6

a facial challenge essentially consists of.

7

look to see whether in fact the harmful First Amendment

8

effect has occurred; you look to whether it opens up the

9

possibility for that to occur.

10

GENERAL CLEMENT:

You don't

But I don't think mere

11

theoretical possibility is enough, even in the First

12

Amendment context.

13

question:

14

bring the First Amendment challenge?

15

an element of standing to bring the First Amendment

16

challenge Justice Kennedy has in mind would be a

17

candidate who, first of all, his opposing candidate took

18

substantial amounts of excess contributions.

19

bare minimum, I would think that the plaintiff would

20

have to say that, look, I took up to the cap of the

21

coordinated contributions from my party and I would have

22

loved to have gotten more, the party was willing to give

23

me more, but I wasn't able --

24
25

And I still think you ask the

Does this individual even have standing to

me this is precisely the kind of a situation a facial

And you're

GENERAL CLEMENT:

With respect, Justice

8

Scalia, there is two things.

9

bring a facial challenge or not and there's when you can

There is whether you can

10

you bring it.

11

all of those things are likely, then you probably have

12

standing at the outset.

13

And I think if you go in and allege that

But those allegations weren't made here.

14

The focus of this case has always been on the

15

contribution levels and the contribution provisions of

16

this statute.

17

quite similar, so I'm not --

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

At the end of the day the analysis is

Isn't one of the virtues

19

of the independent self-financed candidate is he can

20

emphasize his independence?

21

to complain about not being able to get too much money,

22

enough money from outside sources.

23

that most of them do finance a very significant

24

percentage of their total campaign costs?

25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

So he very rarely is going

And isn't it a fact

I think all that's right,

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Stevens.

2

challenge to be brought because often times the

3

self-financer is advertising his independence from party

4

and contributors here.

5

And as you suggest, it's an unlikely

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you want us to write an

6

opinion which says that independently wealthy candidates

7

generally have different sorts of views than other

8

people?

9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No, I don't think that's

10

true.

But I think that they do have different ways of

11

raising the funds necessary to mount their campaigns.

12

And I think -- to get back to the focus of

13

this, I think all that the Court needs to recognize is

14

that the Buckley decision itself has created a potential

15

anomaly, because if you want to think about

16

self-financing, you can think about it as being the

17

ultimate form of soft money, because the Constitution

18

itself precludes Congress from limiting the amount of

19

self-funding.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

General, we haven't

21

talked yet about the disclosure, the special disclosure

22

requirements in that money is speech, and in a First

23

Amendment area it strikes me as very problematic that

24

the government requires you to disclose in a

25

differential way how you intend -- when you're spending
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a particular amount of money and on such precise

2

day-by-day requirements.

3

I mean, is there any other area -- if you're

4

writing a book, you don't have to disclose to the

5

government when you're going to publish it and how far

6

along you're getting in the draft.

7

seems this is the same sort of thing in the election

8

context.

9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And yet, it just

Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

10

there are other contexts within the election area where

11

there are comparable disclosure requirements.

12

think I would point you to the McConnell case and the

13

fact that this Court approved a 24-hour disclosure

14

requirement for electioneering communications.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I

But those are

16

applicable across the board.

These are special

17

disclosure requirements for people who are going to

18

engage in additional speech.

19

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I mean, I'm not --

20

I'm not sure that's right in a sense that these are

21

disclosure requirements that apply across the board.

22

The timing is triggered particularly by a candidate's

23

contribution to their own campaign.

24

in which they're different.

25

focusing on that, because I actually think the

So that's the way

But I think it's worth

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

constitutional issues that are implicated by a

2

disclosure of a candidate's contribution to his or her

3

own campaign are actually less significant than

4

generally is true of campaign finance disclosure,

5

because what this Court talked about in Buckley as the

6

primary concern in the disclosure context was the

7

associational rights that are reflected when somebody

8

contributes to a candidate or an organization makes an

9

electioneering communication on behalf of a candidate.

10

I think those associational interests are

11

obviously not implicated when all you're forcing someone

12

to disclose is the amount that they spent on their own

13

campaign.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

think they would require more detailed and more

16

expeditious disclosure of the associational link than of

17

the self-funding?

18

So wouldn't you

And yet it's the exact opposite?

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No.

I would think the

19

Constitution would be more concerned about the

20

disclosing the associational link because there is more

21

than one constitutional interest at issue.

22

if you look at this as a whole there really isn't a

23

differential regime.

24

from the first $10,000 has to be disclosed.

25

anything, the complaint should be the electioneering

And I think

Every electioneering communication

36
Alderson Reporting Company

If

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

communication should come in here complaining about the

2

fact that these self-financing candidates get a free

3

pass for the first $350,000 of their financing, before

4

the disclosure requirements kick in.

5

So I mean, I really think this is a

6

relatively modest disclosure provision and it arises in

7

a context where there aren't associational interests.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
$10,000.

The problem is it's every

As you pointed out, it doesn't require more

10

disclosure.

11

under the system without this 24-hour, and that I think

12

is the complaint, the burden of having every time you

13

spend $10,000 to file something.

14

All of this information would be disclosed

GENERAL CLEMENT:

But Justice Ginsburg, I

15

think that's the same in the electioneering

16

communications, which is it's triggered for $10,000 but

17

I think it continues to be triggered.

18

nature of the challenge, so I may be wrong about that,

19

but I think that's the way that that works.

20

Now, it isn't the

In any event, I think it's a fair point here

21

that the fact that you trigger additional disclosures

22

with each $10,000 I think is useful in informing the

23

electorate; but I also think it's fair to say is

24

necessary in order for the substantive provisions of the

25

statute to operate, because what they want to do is they
37
Alderson Reporting Company

1

want to enable as a self-financed candidate spends

2

additional money as the election date approaches, they

3

want to put the opponent, if they have otherwise reached

4

the cap of what they can raise in additional funds in a

5

position to continue to raise additional funds.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if the -- what

7

if the restriction were more tailored, if Congress

decided the one area where the wealthy really have an

9

advantage is buying television time, so that's what

10

we're going to restrict.

11

a certain amount of television time, we're going to

12

allow contributions to the less wealthy candidate to buy

13

television time.

If the wealthy individual buys

I think it would be

17

reacting to the same basic phenomenon, which is one

18

aspect of the campaign finance regime gives self-

19

financers an ability to spend a tremendous amount of

20

money and creates a potential disparity.

21

the disparity is the fact that you have relatively low

22

hard money contribution caps, and Congress recognized --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think it's

What if one party has more

time on his hands?

He's -- he's unemployed, so he --

2

has a job most of the time.

3

disparity, too?

4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

He has -- he

Are you going to even that

No, Justice Scalia, and

5

again I think there's an important distinction between

6

trying to level the playing field in every respect --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I can understand leveling,

8

leveling contribution limits when you're worried about

9

corruption, I can understand that.

But doing it just to

10

-- to make sure that there is an even playing field, I

11

-- there's just no end to that.

12

that makes it an even playing feed.

13

factors -- incumbency, the war chest that incumbents

14

have which -- money from the last election, that isn't

15

counted for -- for the millionaires' provision.

16

And it just isn't money
A lot of other

There are so many factors that -- that go to

17

making the even playing field that I -- I'm just very

18

reluctant to acknowledge a congressional power to -- to

19

sit in judgment of our elections that way.

20

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Scalia, I

21

mean, in an odd way I think this principle is actually

22

implicit in the plurality opinion against -- in Randall

23

v. Sorrell.

24

that opinion this Court said, the plurality said, that

25

contribution limits can in some ways be too low because

I know you didn't join that opinion, but in

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

if they're too low they preclude the ability for

2

somebody to raise enough money and that exaggerates the

3

advantages that incumbents have.

4

really made an analogous judgment here.

5

suggesting it was constitutionally compelled, but they

6

made an analogous judgment, which is there is more than

7

one source of advantage; one source of advantage is the

8

self-financing candidate's ability to spend unlimited

9

amounts of their own money.

And I think Congress
I'm not

They respected the fact

10

that that's a constitutional entitlement, but they said

11

it's not that in the abstract that's the problem; it's

12

the combination of unlimited self-financing and

13

relatively low hard money contribution caps --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

16

But --- and they relaxed the

one thing that they could control, which was the cap.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

decided that a debate on a particular issue was

19

distorted by the wealth of owners of newspapers?

20

it passed a law saying that people who are responding to

21

that are relieved of the tax burden they would otherwise

22

have to pay, on whatever their -- you know, sales tax on

23

pamphlets that they want to sell.

24

right?

25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

So what if Congress

And so

Would that be all

I --

40
Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

To level the playing

field on the debate on that particular issue?

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think it might be and

4

it's not that radically different than what this Court

5

approved in Ragan against Taxation Without

6

Representation.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No -- so you can tax

8

-- you can tax a newspaper, but you cannot -- you don't

9

have to tax people who are responding to the newspaper?

10

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The taxing power is

12

an -- is a limit on the exercise of First Amendment

13

rights?

14

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Maybe there are

15

differences in that particular context.

16

Freedom of Press clause informs the analysis.

17

Court has upheld the regime that withheld tax benefits

18

to an organization if it engaged in lobbying; and at the

19

same time this Court said that it was okay to give those

20

tax benefits --

21
22
23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Maybe the
But this

But that's any --

any organization that engaged in lobbying.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Yes, but the next couple

24

of lines of the opinion said:

And it's okay if we give

25

those tax benefits back to a veterans organization, but
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

only veterans organizations.

2

case shows up is that the Court has recognized that the

3

government has a fair amount of flexibility.

4

So I just think what that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So is there no

5

limitation on the rationale of leveling the playing

6

field throughout the First Amendment?

7

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No, there is -- there is a

8

limiting principle, and I think that, importantly, there

9

is a limiting principle that's very applicable to this

10

very context, which is I think if Congress went to the

11

point where they weren't doing what I think they're

12

doing here, which is not trying to limit the amount of

13

self-financing, but using it as a mechanism here to

14

identify particularly costly races where they should

15

raise the contribution limits, if they went further and

16

basically said we're going to give you public financing

17

if your opponent self-finances, and we're going to give

18

you two dollars for every dollar that your opponent

19

self-finances, I think at that point as a practical

20

matter the regime would operate as a ban on -- as a cap,

21

just like this Court held in Buckley.

22

But I think that's the way to approach this

23

issue, which is to basically say if what Congress is

24

doing is really trying to effectively cap

25

self-expenditures, then Congress cannot do that; but if
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

what Congress is doing is giving candidates choice and

2

is trying to react to the regulatory environment created

3

by self-financing --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's trying --

5

it's certainly trying to chill self-financing by

6

burdening it when it reaches a certain level.

7

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I mean, I really don't

8

think that's an accurate description of what happened

9

here, because if you look at the legislative record here

10

-- I know not everybody likes to do that -- but if you

11

look at the legislative record here, you will see that

12

both parties in this, the opponents and the proponents

13

of this amendment, realize that they couldn't limit

14

self-financing and that they were unlikely to limit

15

self-financing because it's such an attractive option

16

for parties and for candidates.

17

it as a given that the effect of Section 319 and its

18

Senate counterpart would be to put more money, not less

19

money, into electoral speech.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

And both parties took

How is it that there is a

21

serious corruption problem in most instances if a

22

contributor gives more than $2,300 to a candidate, but

23

there is no serious -- presumably Congress doesn't think

24

there is a serious corruption problem when this statute

25

kicks in and somebody gives $6,900 to a candidate?
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Alito, what

2

I would say is that what the relaxation of the

3

contribution limits reflects is an adjustment of other

4

interests; and I don't think in principle what Congress

5

has done here is different from what a number of States

6

do, which is they say for the race for governor the

7

contribution cap limit is going to be 2,000; for State

8

auditor it will be a little less; and for local

9

representative it will be substantially less.

10

Now, I suppose somebody could have come in

11

and said, look, you know, the race for governor you can

12

give $2,000; you can only give a 1,000 for this

13

representative race, so surely that's irrational because

14

the State has recognized that a contribution of $2,000

15

is noncorrupting.

16

and I think this Court's --

17

It's not the way it's ever proceeded

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't there a difference,

18

because it may take -- it may take more money to

19

campaign for a particular office, and so the -- it might

20

take a greater amount to have a corrupting influence on

21

-- on that particular race than on a race where the

22

total amount spent is -- is lower.

23

talking about different offices.

24
25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No.

But here you're not

But I think you're

talking about Congress using a mechanism that is equally
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

effective in identifying races that are likely to be

2

more expensive.

3

$350,000 of their own money, that's every bit as likely

4

to be a more expensive race than the race for governor

5

or State treasurer or a local representative.

6

that's why I think this is so responsive to the problem

7

that Congress recognized with the combination --

8
9

When one party is spending more than

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

But it applies different

limits to different in the same -- to candidates in the

10

same race.

11

potential corruption if he got $2,300 -- $2,301 from a

12

-- from a contributor, but his opponent in exactly the

13

same race would not be exposed to corruption if he got

14

$6,900?

15

So why would Mr. Davis be subject to

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, can I say two things

16

in response to that?

One is it would not be

17

unprecedented for this Court to approve a regime where

18

the choices of the candidates led to different

19

contribution levels in the exact same race for the exact

20

same office, because that's what happens in Buckley in

21

the public financing scheme that this Court approved.

22

If somebody accepts public financing for the general

23

election for presidency, they are effectively agree to a

24

zero contribution limit; whereas, their opponent, minor

25

party opponent for example, would be subject to higher
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

contribution level.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's the price of

3

accepting the government subsidy.

4

accepting a government subsidy here.

5

spending his own money --

6

GENERAL CLEMENT:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

GENERAL CLEMENT:

9

They're -- nobody is
The man is

But one --- for a speech.
But one of the prices of

accepting the government subsidy in Buckley was to agree

10

to limit your own financing of your own campaign to

11

$50,000.

12

Now, their whole theory of this case is that

13

somehow a benefit to their opponent is the same thing as

14

a detriment to themselves.

15

mean, the base lines here are sufficiently manipulable;

16

the analogy is exactly the same.

17

And it seems to me that -- I

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can you back to Justice

18

Kennedy's question, where as I took it he identifies a

19

problem that he sees in this portion of this act which,

20

should the limit be exceeded by our opponent, then we

21

can go to the party and the party can give us more?

22

Now, assume for the sake of argument that he has

23

correctly identified a problem with that.

24

understanding is that once the limit is exceeded and you

25

have this extra amount, three things happen:
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Now, my

One, an

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

individual could contribute two or three times the

2

amount to the party directly.

3

an individual who has exceeded the global amount now

4

gets a bump up and can contribute.

5

is the party thing.

6

A second possibility is

And the third thing

So focus on that statute where this is

7

written.

8

there were a problem with the party, would that

9

particular form of words in the statute be severable

10

In your opinion, if, for the sake of argument,

from the rest of it?

11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It certainly would,

12

Justice Breyer, and one thing to keep in mind in

13

interpreting the statute is that it has Section 401 of

14

the original BCRA -- I think we have it at page 28 of

15

our brief -- is what I would describe, I think, as a

16

"super-severability" clause, because it says not only

17

are unconstitutional provisions severable, but even

18

unconstitutional applications of the same provision are

19

severable.

20

And I think there would be no problem

21

effectively leaving the statute with the disclosure

22

requirements in place and two of the three means of

23

taking advantage of additional opportunities that the

24

statute affords challengers.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It --

47
Alderson Reporting Company

GENERAL CLEMENT:
would be severable.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

GENERAL CLEMENT:

9

On the theory that it

doesn't make much sense anyway?

5

7

So I certainly think it

Is that why --

No.
-- we can chop it up this

way?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

No.

To the contrary, on

the theory that this statute operates on this record

10

without that provision being implicated at all.

11

in the first applications of this, the entirety of the

12

2004 election cycle, no party took advantage of the

13

coordinated --

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

GENERAL CLEMENT: -- contributions.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I mean,

But I thought that --

-- that Justice Breyer's

17

question, General Clement, was he asked you to assume

18

that that was unconstitutional, and you were answering

19

if it was unconstitutional.

20

whose speech is being discouraged in the picture, and

21

that's the contributor to the self-financed candidate.

22

You have to recognize that that one can't speak as much

23

vis-a-vis the contributors to the other candidate.

24
25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

But there is one person

I mean, I would concede

that there will be these differential limits, but it's
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

based on the choice of the candidate to engage or not in

2

self-financing, and -- I mean, the restriction there is

3

much more substantial than the public financing scheme

4

approved by this Court in Buckley, because in the

5

general election if the candidate decides that it's

6

going to -- that a candidate is going to take the public

7

financing scheme then in the general presidential

8

election I can't give even a dollar to that candidate.

9

And it's also I think worth recognizing that

10

in Buckley this Court recognized that, for

11

constitutional and associational rights purposes, it's

12

really the ability to associate with the candidate by

13

giving any contribution, rather than the amount of the

14

contribution, that satisfies that limit.

15

In all events, this is not a challenge

16

that's being brought by contributors.

And I think it's

17

worth recognizing that Appellant, even though some of

18

its challenge, and I would say the gravamen of the

19

challenge, sounds -- his challenge sounds in equal

20

protection terms, he doesn't really want a leveling-up

21

where the opportunity would be for contributors to both

22

candidates to make triple the $2300 limits.

23

wants to keep the yoke of relatively low contribution

24

limits on his opponents.

25

such an odd First Amendment challenge.

He really

And that's why I think this is

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

expressed a displeasure at the introduction of

3

self-financing and said that, as you have these very

4

rapid disclosures, that the less wealthy candidate can

5

accept contributions whatever, twice the amount of

6

whatever the self-financed candidate is spending on his

7

campaign?

Is that all right?

8
9

What if the law

If he can spend twice as much?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, he -- you

11

know, the millionaire, as we are talking about, spends

12

-- discloses that he has spent $500,000.

13

contribution limits are off the table for the less

14

wealthy candidate to the tune of a million dollars, in

15

other words twice as much as the self-financed

16

candidate.

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Then the

If I'm understanding the

18

hypo which we were just talking about contribution

19

limits, because there are no expenditure limits, if I'm

20

understanding the hypo right, I think that would still

21

be okay.

22

that if a self-financer spends beyond a certain amount,

23

then what is important is that then the contribution

24

limits would be lifted entirely.

25

could do that, as long as they maintained what they

I mean, I think if Congress had decided here

I suppose Congress

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

called the "parity principle" or the "proportionality

2

principle," which is in no circumstance will the

3

opponent be able to raise more than the amount of the

4

additional spending.

5

that that would be relaxed so that they could raise

6

twice as much, I think that would raise more difficult

7

constitutional questions.

8
9

And if your hypo is suggesting

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, why not?

Because as -- your point in this case, rather than the

10

hypothetical, is that the self-financed candidate is not

11

burdened in any way, but simply that his opponent has

12

benefited.

13

case of my hypothetical as well.

14

And it seems to me that would be true in the

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Again, if I'm

15

understanding the hypo right, I think you would say

16

there that the candidate is effectively burdened because

17

if you get to the point where you're past what I would

18

call "parity" and you actually -- by spending an

19

additional dollar, you're allowing your opponent to

20

spend $2 additional additionally, I think at that point

21

a rational candidate is not going to engage in

22

self-finance.

23

operate as an absolute cap, rather than the way it

24

operates here, which is not as a cap.

25

you look at the numbers in the record, joint appendix

And so in practice, the provision would

51
Alderson Reporting Company

And I think if

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

page 89 -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would have thought

3

all the arguments that you gave before, like the

4

self-financed candidate wants to be able to say he

5

doesn't rely on contributions and so on, those would

6

still be equally applicable.

7

GENERAL CLEMENT:

They would, but I do think

8

the statute in practice would operate quite differently.

9

And that's why I think it's very helpful that we have a

10
11

record here in this case that we can cite to.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's not a --

12

it's not a qualitative argument you're making but a

13

quantitative.

14

opponent gets to be too much of a chill on the

15

self-financed candidate, but under this system you think

16

it's below the line.

17

At some point, the benefit to the

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I would put it differently

18

and say we're not arguing for a principle without

19

limits, but what I would say is that we really benefit

20

here from the fact that this Court found no standing for

21

the challenge to the Millionaires' Provision in

22

McConnell, and we have a record of actual experience.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Suppose we found -- we were

24

of the view that all of the provisions, that the

25

benefits given to the other side here are bad.
52
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

suppose we could even -- re-even the playing field by

2

either denying those benefits to the candidate opposing

3

the Appellant, the Petitioner here, or we could do the

4

opposite and eliminate similar restrictions upon -- upon

5

the Petitioner.

6

to go?

7

Do you have any idea which way we ought

GENERAL CLEMENT:

May I answer the question?

8

I mean, you're right that to the extent that this says

9

this really sounds as an equal protection case more than

10

a First Amendment case, at the remedial stage you'd ask

11

the question:

12

candidates have a larger cap or should we level down and

13

hold them both to the $2300 level?

14

Should we level up and have both

I would say two things, if I may.

One is

15

it's no accident that Appellant isn't asking you to

16

level up because what -- they're not interested in doing

17

additional financing; they're really taking --

18

interested in taking advantage of keeping the opponent

19

down to the $2300 level.

20

The only other thing that I would say about

21

this choice between leveling up and leveling down is I

22

would say that the statute that would have relaxed the

23

caps for both candidates would pose the same First

24

Amendment issue as this statute.
