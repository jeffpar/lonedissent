CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in the Case 07-5439, Baze v. Rees.

5

Mr. Verrilli.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

10

Kentucky's lethal injection procedures pose

11

a danger of cruelly inhumane executions.

12

drug in the three-drug sequence, the anesthetic

13

thiopental, is not effectively administered to the

14

executed inmate, then the second drug, pancuronium, will

15

induce a terrifying conscious paralysis and suffocation

16

and the third drug, potassium chloride, will inflict an

17

excruciating burning pain as it courses through the

18

veins.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If the first

Mr. Verrilli, your

20

argument is based on improper administration of the

21

protocol.

22

followed there is no risk of pain?

23

You agree that if the protocol is properly

MR. VERRILLI:

I disagree with that

24

respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice.

The protocol simply

25

does not address several key steps where risks can arise
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and, beyond that, the protocol's -- and I think this is

2

critically important -- the protocol's procedures for

3

monitoring to assure that the inmate is adequately

4

anesthetized are practically nonexistent.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought your

6

expert -- I'm looking at page 493 to 494 of the joint

7

appendix -- agreed that if the two grams of sodium

8

pentothal is properly administered, the way he put it,

9

in virtually every case there would be a humane death.

10

MR. VERRILLI:

That is true, but there can

11

be no guarantee that it will be properly administered

12

and that is because even in clinical settings there are

13

always -- there is always the potential for difficulty

14

which manifests itself in actual problems, for example

15

in the setting of an IV.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if it were properly

17

administered, would you have a case here?

18

100 percent of cases are properly administered.

19

MR. VERRILLI:

Let's assume

If there were a way to

20

guarantee that the procedure worked every time, then we

21

wouldn't have substantial risk.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

MR. VERRILLI:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

No, my question -

But Let's assume

hypothetically, and we know this isn't true, that 100
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

percent of the time it's properly administered.

2

you have an argument to present to the Court?

3

MR. VERRILLI:

Then do

Well, if the "if" is, I

4

apologize for this, but for clarity -- the "if" is that

5

100 percent of the time the dose of anesthetic is

6

properly administered into the condemned inmate, then we

7

don't have a significant risk.

8

what the record in this case establishes.

9

establishes the contrary.

Of course that is not
The record

There is -- you cannot assure

10

that there is going to be a guarantee of -- of

11

successful administration of the anesthetic.

12

is why the monitoring part of the process is so

13

critical.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that

But would you -- would

15

the monitoring suffice?

16

by saying there is no way that it could be administered

17

and assure 100 percent against risk, so it would be

18

helpful if you clarified:

19

monitoring adequately and tell us what that would be, or

20

no, there is no way.

21

MR. VERRILLI:

In other words, you started out

Yes, there is a way of

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

I

22

think we have tried to suggest in our brief that there

23

is a way to monitor effectively even with the three-drug

24

protocol.

25

is that one needs a person trained in monitoring

It's challenging.

The key component of that

anesthetic death to participate in the process.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Who would be a medical

3

doctor -- and medical doctors, according to the Code of

4

Ethics of the American Medical Association, can't

5

participate.

6

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, Your Honor, of course,

7

that's why there is another practical alternative here,

8

which solves that problem, which is the single dose of

9

barbituate, which does not require the participation of

10
11

a medically trained professional.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that seems to be a big

12

part your argument, but it doesn't appear that that

13

argument was raised at all in the Kentucky courts, and

14

it seems that there is virtually nothing in the record

15

of this case that shows that that's practical or that

16

it's preferable to the three-drug protocol.

17

be, but without anything in the record of this case, how

18

could we hold that the three drug protocol is

19

unconstitutional?

20

MR. VERRILLI:

It may well

Well, if I may Justice Alito,

21

I do think and I'd like to provide the references where

22

it is raised and then the evidentiary references that

23

support the argument -

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Where was it raised?

citations in the brief that was submitted by your
6
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

co-counsel are inaccurate to show that it was raised in

2

the Kentucky courts.

3

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, at page 684 of the

4

joint appendix, the -- this is the trial brief, the

5

brief raised in the trial court -- one assertion made

6

there is that an alternative chemical or combination of

7

chemicals that poses less risk of unnecessary pain and

8

suffering during an execution is -

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, that's -- that's the

10

trial court, and you think that just the word an

11

"alternative chemical poses less risk" is sufficient to

12

raise the argument that the three-drug protocol is

13

unconstitutional, because a single drug protocol

14

involving thiopental is preferable.

15

MR. VERRILLI:

That one word?

And then -- and then, no.

16

And then later, on page 701, the brief argues that there

17

are nonpainful ways of stopping the heart.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

What are they?

That is, I

19

was -- I can't find -- what should I read?

Because I've

20

read the studies.

21

seemed to me the only referee for it said it wasn't any

22

good.

23

there an amazing sentence to me which says that The

24

Netherlands Information Task Force concluded it is not

25

possible to administer so much of it that a lethal

I've read that Lancet study, which

And I've read the Zimmer study and I found in

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

effect is guaranteed.

2

So I'm left at sea.

3

claim that this is somehow more painful than some other

4

method.

5

What do I read to find it?

But which?

6

They're talking about thiopental.
I understand your contention.

You

And what's the evidence for that?

MR. VERRILLI:

The thiopental is a

7

barbiturate and by definition will inflict death

8

painlessly.

9

expert, the Petitioner s expert and Respondents' expert,

The record in this case establishes -- each

10

testified that it is guaranteed at the three gram dose

11

to cause death.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

But that's what they're -

13

they're giving a three gram dose, I take it, and if -

14

or two grams or three grams; I thought it was three

15

grams here.

16

a risk of human error.

17

generally where you're talking about the death penalty,

18

and this may be one extra problem, one serious

19

additional problem.

20

that there is a more serious problem here than with

21

other execution methods?

22

else should I read?

23

And I ended up thinking of course there is
There is a risk of human error

But the question here is can we say

MR. VERRILLI:

I've read the studies.

What

Well, I think the record

24

references, which I think the record pretty clearly

25

establishes, Your Honor, that death is certain to occur
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

through the use of thiopental at the three gram dose.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

What do we do with the

3

euthanasia -- instead of talking -- I looked; I found it

4

more important to look at what they do with euthanasia

5

than to look at what they do with animals, frankly, and

6

I was therefore taken aback with the sentence I just

7

read to you.

8
9

What am I supposed to do about that?

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, I think to refer

instead to the expert testimony in this case which says

10

that death is certain to occur, and in addition, that

11

medical testimony in this case that it is certain to

12

occur in a very few minutes.

13

references that we provided at page 18 of the reply

14

brief.

15
16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

21

That method has

never been tried, correct.

17
18

Those are the transcript

MR. VERRILLI:
on humans.

Well, it has never been tried

That is correct.

It is -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do we know whether

there are risks of pain accompanying that method?
MR. VERRILLI:

I think you do, Mr. Chief

22

Justice, because by definition, barbituates cannot

23

inflict pain and do not inflict pain.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The record

establishes that the second drug that's used here is
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

used to prevent involuntary muscle contractions.

2

would not be -- there wouldn't be a safeguard against

3

that under one drug protocol, I take it.

4

MR. VERRILLI:

That

Well, yes there would,

5

Mr. Chief Justice, because the reality is that

6

thiopental and other barbituates are anti-convulsives.

7

Their point is to -- among other things to suppress any

8

involuntary muscle -

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can you -- do you

10

agree that that is an appropriate problem to be

11

addressed by the execution protocol, that they should

12

try to reduce the likelihood of involuntary muscle

13

contractions?

14

MR. VERRILLI:

No, because to the extent

15

that the reason that they are offering to do it, is

16

because of the potential for discomfort that it may

17

cause the audience given the risk that the -

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think that their

19

-- one of their reasons was that it would enhance the

20

dignity, not only of the procedure as a whole, but also

21

to the condemned.

22

MR. VERRILLI:

I understand that, Mr. Chief

23

Justice, but given the extent to which it increases the

24

risk that there can be ineffective anesthesia, and it

25

can go undetected, it doesn't seem to us to be an
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

argument of sufficient force to justify using it despite

2

that risk particularly when it seems to us that the

3

issue of dignity can be addressed by communication with

4

the audience.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What do we do with

6

the -- if you prevail here, and the next case is brought

7

by someone subject to the single drug protocol and their

8

claim is:

9

that there's a chance that it would cause muscle

Look this has never been tried.

We do know

10

contractions that would make my death undignified.

11

will certainly extend how long it takes to die, so I'm

12

subject to a lingering death and the more humane

13

protocol would be the three drug protocol?

14

MR. VERRILLI:

It

Well, I think with respect to

15

the lingering death point, I think it would, this

16

Court's cases are talking about is the consciousness of

17

lingering death and the torture that that imposes, which

18

you wouldn't have of course in this situation.

19

think there is a credible argument that the use of a

20

barbituate alone could inflict pain.

21

inflict any pain.

22

possibilities of maladministration, but not

23

maladministration of a one drug protocol that results in

24

any pain, and therefore there is just not a credible

25

Eight Amendment argument.

I don't

They do not

Now, of course there are

It seems to me that it
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

couldn't be cruel and unusual punishment, because there

2

is no pain.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Verrilli, I think

4

that your main argument in this case, I mean, there's -

5

barbituate only seems to have come up rather late in the

6

day, as Justice Alito pointed out, but your main

7

arguments seem to be that the controls were inadequate.

8

So you were beginning to say what controls would be

9

necessary to render this procedure constitutional, and

10

one that you said -- trained personnel to monitor the

11

flow.

12

MR. VERRILLI:

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

MR. VERRILLI:

15

The monitor for anesthetic.
Yes.

To ensure that anesthetic

depth has been achieved and maintained.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

MR. VERRILLI:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And what is -

That is correct.
Two questions:

Who would

19

the trained personnel be?

20

what would be the measures that they would employ?

21

And, the second question,

MR. VERRILLI:

The trained personnel could

22

be a physician, a nurse or anyone trained by them

23

adequately in this process.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Well, what do we do about

the point -- the point that the doctors or the nurses
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

say it's unethical to help with an execution?

I mean,

2

if we are going to talk about the constitutionality of

3

the death penalty per se, that isn't raised in this

4

case.

5

just trying to do this by the back door, insist upon a

6

procedure that can't be used.

And what the other side says is, well, you're

7

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, I think the one point

8

of the one-drug protocol, of course, is to demonstrate

9

that we are not doing that.

Beyond that, it seems to me

10

that the State can't have it both ways with respect to

11

the -- the issue of the participation of medically

12

trained personnel.

13

that we have qualified medically able personnel

14

participating in this process and that's our guarantee

15

of its efficacy, and on the other hand say a requirement

16

of having trained qualified personnel participate is

17

impossible.

18

that participate in Kentucky are under the same ethical

19

set of issues as doctors are.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

On the one hand, they cannot say

And they do say that.

For example the EMTs

Could you use those EMTs?

21

Would they be qualified?

Would the team that inserts

22

the IV, would that team be qualified?

23

MR. VERRILLI:

With additional training they

24

could be qualified.

They aren't qualified by virtue of

25

their training to become EMTs.

They would have to be

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

additionally trained.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Verrilli, are we in the

3

difficult position in hearing your answers that, in

4

effect, we're being asked to make findings of fact about

5

the availability of medical personnel and the

6

feasibility of training and so on that the trial court

7

never made because it didn't think it had to make a

8

comparative analysis here, so that if, in fact, the

9

comparative analysis is crucial to the case, we should

10

send the thing back for factfinding by a trial judge

11

rather than trying to do it here.

12

we accept your argument?

13

MR. VERRILLI:

Should we remand if

It is true Justice Souter

14

that the trial court did not make factual findings on a

15

whole range of issues with respect to the difficulties

16

of constituting the proper dose, the risk of catheter

17

placement, the risk of blowouts, the risk of mixing up

18

syringes, and the adequacy of the monitoring.

19

agree, Your Honor, that it did so because it didn't

20

believe that that was particularly relevant to the issue

21

before it.

22

disagreement with respect to the legal test.

23

And I

And that's the -- the basis of our

Now, it is -- it is our position that the

24

record is sufficiently clear and sufficiently

25

uncontradicted on the key points with particular respect
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to monitoring that the Court would not have to remand

2

but it certainly would be a reasonable thing to do in

3

view of the deficiencies in the actual findings.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You were interrupted, and

5

you gave Justice Ginsburg -- you said you have two

6

problems for monitoring.

7

this and what measures would they use.

She asked you who would do

8

MR. VERRILLI:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

Right.
And you were never able to

get to the second.

11

MR. VERRILLI:

With respect to the second,

12

it's a combination.

13

equipment, EKG and blood pressure cuff which is the

14

standard practice used for monitoring for

15

unconsciousness, but in addition, as the expert

16

testimony in the case established, you have to have

17

close -- close visual observation by the trained person.

18

They would use the available

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, as to the cuff, I

19

thought the record was rather clear that it is just not

20

used at these low blood pressure levels.

21

MR. VERRILLI:

No, I don't think so, Justice

22

Kennedy.

There was some question about whether the

23

third device that this monitor is used but the blood -

24

the tracking of blood pressure is a critical way of

25

monitoring for unconsciousness as is the EKG and 15
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Verrilli, this is an

2

execution, not surgery.

The other side contends that

3

you need to monitor the depth of the unconsciousness.

4

When you expect to bring the person back and do not want

5

harm to occur to the person.

6

know whether the person is unconscious or not all it

7

takes is a slap in the face and shaking the person.

8

MR. VERRILLI:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

But they assert that to

Well -

MR. VERRILLI:

That's their contention.
There is no slap in the face.

11

There is no shaking the person.

12

that kind whatsoever under the Kentucky protocol.

13

even under that understanding, which we don't think is

14

correct, that -- we don't have that here and that's one

15

of the problems.

an untrained warden and an untrained deputy warden who

17

had testified in this case that they don't know what to

look for to determine whether somebody is conscious or

unconscious.

There's no testing of
So

All there is, is visual observation by

JUSTICE SCALIA:

With regard to the trial

21

court's failure to make findings about the availability

22

of people to do this and about the possibility of -

23

practical possibility of more effective and less painful

24

drugs, was that a failure to ignore evidence that you

25

produced?
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. VERRILLI:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It -

Did you introduce evidence

3

to show that indeed medically trained personnel were

4

readily available to do the things you say?

5

MR. VERRILLI:

I don't think we introduced

6

evidence that medically trained personnel were ready

7

available, but we did introduce evidence about what

8

needed to be done and, of course, as I said, Kentucky

9

like the other states had their ability to bring

10

medically qualified personnel to bear to run this

11

process.

And so I do think -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm very reluctant to send

13

it back to the trial court so we can have a nationwide

14

cessation of all executions while the trial court

15

finishes its work and then it goes to another appeal to

16

the State supreme court and ultimately, well, it could

17

take years.

18
19

MR. VERRILLI:

Honor, and that's why I suggest -

20
21
22

I understand that, Your

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You wouldn't want that to

happen.
MR. VERRILLI:

That's why I suggested that

23

there is -- that this case can be decided on the basis

24

of the record here because the undisputed expert

25

testimony on these key issues shows the deficiencies in
17

the protocol.

2
3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I ask you another

question?

4

MR. VERILLI:

Yes.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I ask another question

6

about the state of the evidence.

It really goes to an

7

understanding of your position that was discussed a

8

little bit earlier about the preferability of simply

9

barbiturate dose as opposed to the three-drug

10

combination.

You said a moment ago that the evidence

11

was -- and I think it was undisputed evidence -- that

12

three grams of the barbiturate actually used would be

13

sufficient to cause death; is that correct.

14

MR. VERRILLI:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16

MR. VERRILLI:

17

That's correct.

Each side's expert testified

to precisely the same thing.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

MR. VERRILLI:

20
21

And that was undisputed?

Okay.
Three grams was certain to

cause death.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

So that if the current

22

three-gram dosage were used and the second and third

23

drugs were not administered, death would occur based on

24

the undisputed evidence in this case.

25

MR. VERRILLI:

The record establishes that
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

death is certain.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Secondly, my understanding,

3

my recollection, is that in a couple of places in your

4

brief, one at least, you referred to the preferability

5

That is the massive dose.

appropriately be if you decided or if a protocol author

decided that there would be no chance whatsoever that

death would not occur, and the amount should be greater

than three grams?

above three grams?

The first one is this:

The core concern of

the Eighth Amendment at the time of its founding, of

course, was precisely the question of whether the

carrying out of death sentences would inflict torturous

23

deaths.

24
25

So we're at the core of the historical concern.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

that.

No, I don't agree with

The concern was with torture, which is the

intentional infliction of pain.

2

three-quarters of the States that have the death

3

penalty, all except one of whom use this method of

4

execution, they haven't set out to inflict pain.

5

contrary, they have introduced it presumably because

6

they, indeed, think it's a more humane way, although not

7

one that is free of all risk.

8
9

MR. VERRILLI:

Now, these States, the

To the

That's the second principle,

Your Honor, is that this Court's cases, including the

10

ones that Your Honor averted to, have said that the

11

standard is whether the means of execution inflicts

12

unnecessary pain.

Well, then, you're changing

21

your position. You said -- you just said earlier that we

22

didn't have to find the least painful way.

23

MR. VERRILLI:

No, that's correct, because

-JUSTICE SCALIA:

But if you're not using the

22
Alderson Reporting Company

least painful way, you are inflicting unnecessary pain,

2

aren't you?

3

MR. VERRILLI:

No.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. VERRILLI:

Can you rectify that?
Yes, because, Justice Scalia,

6

our position is that the pain that is inflicted here

7

when this goes wrong is torturous, excruciating pain

8

under any definition.

We're not talking about a slight

9

increment different.

We're talking about the infliction

10

of torturous pain.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't your position that

12

every form of execution that has ever been used in the

13

United States, if it were to be used today, would

14

violate the Eighth Amendment?

15

MR. VERRILLI:

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.
Well, which form that's been

used at some time in an execution would not violate?

you had experts who understood the dropweight, you know,

If there is a risk of

5

torturous pain and if there are readily available

6

alternatives that could obviate the risk, then any

7

significant risk -

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Hanging's no good.

What

about electrocution?

10

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, it would depend.

The

11

argument about electrocution, Justice Scalia, is whether

12

or not it is painless, and that was its point when it

13

was enacted, that it would be a painless form of death.

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It has to be, it has to be

painless?

16

MR. VERRILLI:

It does not, but that was its

17

point, and I think one would have to subject it to the

18

test to see whether it inflicts severe pain that is

19

readily avoidable by an alternative.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

You have no doubt that the

21

three judge protocol that Kentucky is using violates the

22

Eighth Amendment, but you really cannot express a

judgment about any of the other methods that has ever

drawing from the dictionary definitions that Your Honor

posed in the Harmline case, this is unusual in precisely

9

MR. ENGLERT:

Justice Stevens, let me be

very precise in this answer, if I can.

What is clear is

10

that a rapidly administered three or five gram dose of a

11

barbituate would cause death in normal circumstances.

12
13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And if it doesn't, if you

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. ENGLERT:

I understand.

My understanding is that the

human body can't take more than a certain amount of the

Mr. Englert, can I ask you

a rather basic question?

15

constitutionality of the three-drug protocol itself is

16

at issue in this case or merely the question whether

17

Kentucky has done an adequate job of using that

18

protocol?

19

MR. ENGLERT:

Do you think the

Well, I think what's properly

20

before the Court is only the latter question.

21

obviously -

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But

So if we just decide this

23

on the ground -- and the record is very persuasive in

24

your favor, I have to acknowledge -- but if we decide

25

the fact that Kentucky is doing an adequate job of
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

administering this protocol, that would leave open the

2

question whether the basic use of this second drug,

3

which does nothing but avoid unpleasantness of the

4

visitors, is itself constitutional?

5

MR. ENGLERT:

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

7
8
9
10
11

Well Do we have to wait for

another case to decide that rule?
MR. ENGLERT:

I -- the Court could write an

opinion either way, obviously.

There is a good reason

to hold that the use of the second drug is permissible.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Because I -- to be very

12

honest with you, I think that you're -- you make a very

13

strong case on the administration in Kentucky on the

14

record in this case, but I'm terribly troubled by the

15

fact that the second drug is what seems to cause all the

16

risk of excruciating pain, and seems to be almost

17

totally unnecessary in terms of any rational basis for a

18

requirement.

19

MR. ENGLERT:

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21
22

Well, Your Honor But that we're not going

to be able to decide today.
MR. ENGLERT:

Petitioner's own brief

23

acknowledges that the three-drug protocol can be applied

24

constitutionally.

4

But that leaves often a whole

MR. ENGLERT:

Every State that has publicly

would be very strange to hold that that is cruel and

But no legislature has

No, no.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The three-drug protocol?

13

MR. ENGLERT:

14

Justice Ginsburg, back to your question.

The three-drug protocol.

15

There is a reason why the IV team members leave the

16

room.

17

and the people in the room can be seen by the victim's

18

families, by the inmate's families and by the media.

19

Protecting the anonymity of the execution team is

20

extremely important.

21

pressures if their anonymity is not protected.

22

instead of staying in the room, they go again behind a

23

one-way mirror in an adjacent room where they have an

24

extremely good line of sight to the IVs.

25

actually covered in the trial record in this case, that

JUSTICE GINSBURG: And the executioners are
also not visible to the public?

8

MR. ENGLERT:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

And it's not -

Correct.
There was a finding that

the second drug serves no therapeutic purpose.

11

MR. ENGLERT:

That's correct.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

MR. ENGLERT:

That's -

We don't quarrel with that.

14

The purpose it serves is the purpose of dignifying the

15

process for the benefit of the inmate and for the

16

benefit of the witnesses.

17

The Chief Justice said, isn't there going to

18

be litigation against another protocol as soon as it's

19

adopted, and yes, Mr. Verrilli will say that's silly, to

20

protect the dignity of the inmate, that argument will

21

fail.

22

suggests that the next advocate who comes along

23

representing an inmate will say, the one drug protocol

24

is no good because it doesn't do enough to protect the

25

dignity, or the two drug protocol is no good because it

But the history of death penalty litigation

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

doesn't do enough to protect dignity.

2

With respect to the time it takes to carry

3

out an execution and whether that's a legitimate

4

consideration, I actually invite the Court's attention

5

to one of the briefs, amicus briefs, filed in support of

6

Petitioners, the Human Rights Watch brief, which in turn

7

cites the decision of the UN Human Rights Committee in

8

the NG case.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if we held that that

10

justification was insufficient to justify this protocol,

11

it's hardly likely we would hold that it's so serious

12

and make the whole procedure unconstitutional.

13
14
15

MR. ENGLERT:

I'm not sure I follow the

question.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

The interest in protecting

16

the dignity of the inmate and of the observers is the

17

justification for the second drug.

18

MR. ENGLERT:

Yes.

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If we held that that -

20

that that justification is insufficient to justify the

21

protocol, how could we ever hold that that justification

22

is so serious as to make the whole procedure

23

unconstitutional.

24
25

MR. ENGLERT:
could hold that.

I'll tell you frankly how you

death are at stake.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And presumably it

7

would depend upon whatever new alternative the plaintiff

8

in that case proposed.

9

MR. ENGLERT:

Correct.

If the standard is

10

truly eliminating all unnecessary risk of pain than

11

anything that is not the single optimal standard is

12

unconstitutional, and the States cannot do what they

13

have done for the last 220 years, which is to use

different protocols at different times and work to

improve their protocols.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

20

24
25

AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Petitioners ask this Court to invalidate a
method of execution that everyone agrees is entirely
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

pain free when followed and to order the State of

2

Kentucky to adopt a method that has never been used in

3

any execution and is out of step with the laws and

4

practice in every death penalty jurisdiction in the

5

United States.

6

that Petitioners say requires this extraordinary result

7

has several fundamental flaws.

8
9

The proposed constitutional standard

First, it is at odds with this Court's
precedence establishing a substantial risk threshold for

10

claims of future injury in the Eighth Amendment context

11

and this Court's cases holding that the added anguish

12

caused by the negligent, accidental or inadvertent

13

infliction of pain is not the unnecessary infliction of

14

pain prescribed by the Eighth Amendment.

15

Marshall wrote that for the Court in the Estelle v.

16

Gamble opinion on page 105, and this Court has

17

reiterated the principle that negligent, accidental or

18

inadvertent infliction of pain, however strong or

19

anguishing, is

20

Justice

not proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What do you say to the

21

response which I think was in the briefs that the

22

substantiality requirement has been derived in the

23

course of conditions of confinement -- sort of

24

litigation -- and we really should regard execution as

25

sort of a -- a separate subject for purposes of coming
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

up with a standard.

2

What do you say to that?

MR. GARRE:

A few things.

We are here today

3

in this Section 1983 action, because this Court and the

4

Hill case and the Nelson case analogized methods of

5

execution claims to conditions of confinement claims

6

insofar as these claims are not directed to the

7

punishment itself, but to the manner in which punishment

8

is implemented or carried out.

9

under the Hill and Nelson case put these types of cases

10

So this Court itself

into the conditions of confinement.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, we did for purposes

12

of making a habeas 1983 distinction, but I -- is the

13

distinction supportable when we come down to the

14

question whether there should be a standard specific to

15

execution as opposed to other conditions?

16

MR. GARRE:

I don't think it is, Justice

17

Souter.

The substantial risk standard that the Court

18

has applied in the Farmer v. Brennan case and the Hiland

19

v.

20

confinement claims -- where inmates faced the risk of an

21

excruciating pain or even death.

22

standard that the Court applies to someone who is forced

23

to spend -- to live with a five pack a day smoker is

24

substantial risk, even though that person faces the risk

25

of developing lung cancer, which everybody would agree

McKinney case -- applied to conditions of

If the risk -- if the

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is excruciatingingly painful death they're not sure why

2

the Constitution would place any different standard with

3

respect to the types of claims at issue in this case.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is there any comparative

5

element in the substantial risk standard, if it were

6

clearly established, undisputed that there was an

7

alternative method that was much less risky, would there

8

be an Eighth Amendment problem with the State or the

9

Federal government nevertheless persisted in using a

10
11

method that was inferior?
MR. GARRE:

We think that that could be part

12

of the analysis -- that you would look to other feasible

13

available alternatives.

14
15

Although I would say that -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If that's part of the

analysis, this never ends.

16

MR. GARRE:

Well, Justice -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If that's part of the

18

analysis, there will always be some claim that there is

19

some new method that's been devised, and once again

20

executions are stayed throughout the country.

21

MR. GARRE:

And we agree with that, and

22

that's why we think that Petitioner's claim is wrong.

23

It's going to lead to endless litigation and a regime in

24

which there is no finality.

25

make, in response to Justice Alito, is that as a

The other point I wanted to

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

threshold matter, this court case is establishing that

2

you have to show with respect to the method you're

3

challenging, a risk that is more than the risk of

4

negligence or accident in the method that is being

5

carried out.

6

that, Farmer v. Brennan reiterates that -

7

And again, Estelle v. Gamble establishes

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you're standard is that

8

there has -- well, don't let me misphrase it for you,

9

but there have to be other obvious available

10

alternatives.

11

MR. GARRE:

Well, the way that we've

12

described it, Justice Kennedy, is you that have to show

13

a substantial risk that the method you're challenging

14

would impose a considerably greater degree of pain than

15

other available feasible alternatives.

16

that kind of comparative inquiry, we do think that you

17

have to get over the first threshold established by this

18

Court's cases -- that you're arguing about something

19

other than the accidental or negligent infliction of

20

pain, and we don't think Petitioners in this case have

21

even gotten over that hurdle.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But to get into

So your safeguard one is

23

the only -- you have against Justice Scalia, endless

24

litigation, or does your threshold two do the same

25

thing.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. GARRE:

Well, threshold two would as

2

well because once you're into that kind of comparative

3

inquiry you would still have to take a look at the

4

feasible other alternative and no one has ever tried the

5

one drug alternative.

6

don't know whether it's going to work in practice.

7

Justice Breyer you're right we

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Those who oppose capital

8

punishment entirely across the board are quite willing

9

to take a careful look at everything.

They are quite

10

willing to take a look at other alternatives.

11

the problem we come up with a decision that requires a

12

careful look in every case whenever there is a newly

13

developed method of execution the problem will always be

14

before us and executions will always be impermissible.

15

We agree with those concerns, Justice Scalia, I want to

16

be clear.

17

That's

Our standard is not a least risk JUSTICE BREYER:

You have to, I mean, I

18

can't, I don't know if "substantial" is the right word

19

to capture it.

20

significant risk that can be easily averted and what I'm

21

worried about here is do we or do we not send it back,

22

I'm quite honestly disturbed by the fact that in this -

23

I can't report they both recommend pancuronium and that

24

the sodium thiopental doesn't work not even in grams of

25

three doses in all cases but they think the contrary and

Perhaps the right word is is there a

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

if there is uncertainty here should we send it back for

2

consideration of all these things in a more full hearing

3

under a standard that does allow comparisons with other

4

methods not to find a comparison not too fine a

5

comparison but at least a practical comparison.

6

MR. GARRE:

And the answer is no.

First and

7

foremost they had an opportunity to develop the one drug

8

alternative below.

They made no effort to present any

9

evidence on that.

The record is completely undeveloped

10

and typically this court doesn't allow people to go back

11

and relitigate a case again.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes but if we don't do

13

something like that in this case Mr. Garre another case

14

is going to come along and we are going to be right back

15

here a year from now or 18 months from now and wouldn't

16

it be better to get one case litigated thoroughly and

17

get the issue decided rather than simply wait here for

18

another one to wind its way.

19

MR. GARRE:

We think that this court should

20

decide the issue.

21

saying Petitioners have not established a

22

constitutionally significant.

23

We think it should decide it by

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Sure but if we decide it on

24

this basis the next Petitioner is going to say I'm

25

coming into court with evidence these people did not
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

present and therefore we are going to have a new case

2

and new round of litigation and I think what's

3

disturbing Justice Breyer what's disturbing me and

4

others is we want some kind of a decision here, and it

5

seems to me that the most expeditious way of getting it

6

if comparison analysis is appropriate and I will be

7

candid to say I think it is is to send this case back

8

and say okay do a comparative analysis, make the

9

findings and we will then have a case that will in

10

effect resolve the issue as much as one case can ever

11

do.

12

MR. GARRE:

Let me make two responses to

13

that if I could again we don't think Petitioners have

14

shown anything close to a substantially of risk and

15

second a virtue in allowing there is a virtue in not

16

going further in this case and allowing the states

17

themselves to continue to assess this matter.

18

states have continuously reassessed and repeated

19

modifications to their lethal injection protocols three

20

states within the last years have taken major internal

21

reviews of the three drug protocol California Tennessee

22

23

safeguards were warranted but that -

risk of negligence or improper execution of what, of

3

what the protocol requires right?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That would be You would say that so long,

6

so long as the only risk comes from negligent

7

application of the protocol, no comparison is required?

8

MR. GARRE:

Yes.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And if we decided that, if

10

we decided that if this protocol is properly executed,

11

it does not create a substantial risk that would be the

end of the matter wouldn't it.

marker that this is a real danger sufficiently real that

it's not tolerated with animals.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the anesthesia

3

concern of course is you don't want to kill the person

4

when you're administering just anesthesia in a surgery

5

so you would want somebody trained there that you could

6

bring them back if anything went wrong that concern is

7

not present here.

8
9

MR. VERRILLI:

Nor is it present with

respect to euthanizing animals and never the -- it's the

10

danger of the anesthesia going wrong there can be a

11

torturous pain inflicted that has led veterinarians to

12

say you have to have somebody in the process who is

13

trained in monitoring anesthetic death and Justice

14

Breyer if I could refer back to your Netherlands point

15

my understanding is that in the Netherlands there is a

16

doctor present who is trained in anesthesiology who

17

administers this whole process and so the risk is

18

dramatically different in a situation where you have

19

that trained person there than the situation we have in

20

Kentucky now with respect to the other states and the

21

other so-called botched executions that my friend

22

Mr. Englert referred to is just not right to say that

23

they were all about cut downs and small problems.

24

record finds a fact in the Morales case without respect

25

to the 11 lethal injection studies there six out of the
55

The

seven were inadequately -- the experts in that case

2

admitted it was likely that one was not likely an at the

3

time -- at the time that the pancuronium and potassium

4

were put in the system similarly in the case in North

5

Carolina the evidence credited by the court was that

6

with respect to four of them the condemned inmate was on

7

the -- any gasping struggling not the kind of

8

involuntary twitching that Mr. Englert is worried about

9

but clear that the anesthetics are not working with

10

respect to the lethality of thiopental at page 42 of the

11

joint appendix Dr. Heath says that thiopental will be

12

lethal by itself three grams at page 494 he says indeed

13

it will be lethal by itself in virtually every case at

14

two grams.

15

page number reference handy but Dr. Dershowitz the

16

state's expert says the same thing now the reference

17

that Mr. Englert referred to at page 499 is where

18

Dr. Heath is being a asked a question of whether would

19

you expect death to occur when three grams are

20

administered but he is being asked a series of questions

21

about administration in a surgical procedure which are

22

using ventilators and other procedures to keep the

23

person alive and he said in that setting the answer is

24

no so that's just not a fair representation of the

25

record at all now with respect to the question of

At page, at page forgive me I don't have the

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

whether we ought to analogize this to the deliberate

2

indifference standard and convictions of confinement

3

cases it seems to me there is a fundamental difference

4

here which is that the Commonwealth of Kentucky is

5

making a deliberate choice here.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Finish your

sentence.
MR. VERRILLI:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

9

A deliberate choice here to use chemicals that create

10

this danger and given that it has done so it ought to

11

have the commensurate obligation to take the reasonable

12

steps necessary to on vote the risk.
