CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first today in Case 06-1646, United States v. Rodriguez.

5

Mr. Shanmugam.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. SHANMUGAM:

9

Justice, and may it please the Court:

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief

The Armed Career Criminal Act is one of the

11

Federal Government's most important tools for

12

incapacitating serial offenders who commit serious

13

crimes, and, like other Federal recidivism statutes, the

14

ACCA defines the prior offenses that trigger its

15

application based partly upon the maximum terms of

16

imprisonment for those offenses.

17

in this case is whether the relevant maximum term of

18

imprisonment for an offender who was already a repeat

19

offender is the maximum to which repeat offenders were

20

subject to that offense.

The question presented

21

Alone among the circuits, the Ninth Circuit

22

held that the relevant maximum for a repeat offender is

23

instead the maximum to which first-time offenders were

24

subject, even though that purported maximum would

25

sometimes be lower than the term that a repeated
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

offender would actually receive.

2

cannot support that counterintuitive and counterfactual

3

approach, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit should be

4

reversed.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Because the ACCA

Mr. Shanmugam, what is the

6

government's position as to a person who is not a repeat

7

offender?

8

the government says there are alternative maximums and

9

you have to pick whichever maximum is the higher.

He commits the crime for the first-time.

Now

Why

10

wouldn't that maximum apply to the person who commits

11

the crime the first-time?

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That is because, Justice

13

Scalia, we believe that the text of the ACCA naturally

14

accommodates the possibility that there may be

15

alternative maximum terms of imprisonment for a given

16

offense.

17

924(e)(2)(A)(ii), defines a serious drug offense as "a

18

State drug trafficking offense for which a maximum term

19

of imprisonment of 10 years or more is prescribed by

20

law," and we believe that that language is susceptible

21

to the interpretation that the maximum for a repeat

22

offender is the maximum to which repeat offenders were

23

subject and the maximum for a first-time offender is the

24

maximum to which first-time offenders were subject.

25

that is particularly true because Congress -

The provision the ACCA at issue, Section

4

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're adding something to

2

the elements of the crime and in all of our cases in

3

this field we look to the elements of the crime.

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, to be sure, Justice -

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And as far as the elements

6

are concerned, the maximum sentence for those elements

7

you say is the sentence that would be imposed upon a

8

repeat offender.

9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

To be sure, Justice Scalia,

10

the ACCA speaks of the maximum term of imprisonment for

11

the offense.

12

is no less a maximum for the offense than the lower

13

sentence for first-time offenders.

14

involving challenges to recidivism statutes make that

15

clear because they have uniformly held that a recidivism

16

enhancement constitutes a stiffened penalty for an

17

underlying offense.

18

But a higher sentence for repeat offenders

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This Court's cases

You seem to -- you

19

seem to flinch from the natural consequences of your

20

position in not looking at the maximum for a particular

21

offender.

22

if he was the ringleader his sentence can be enhanced

23

beyond what would otherwise be the maximum for a

24

first-time offender, but you say you don't take that

25

into consideration.

For example, you know, under some guidelines,

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I don't that we're flinching

2

from those consequences, Mr. Chief Justice.

3

that it is simply a consequence of the fact that the

4

statute does speak of the maximum term of imprisonment

5

for the offense, not for the offender.

6

believe -

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think

And, while we

How is that

8

different from your position here, where it is the fact

9

that the individual is a recidivist that causes you to

10
11

look to a different maximum?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

It is because, Mr. Chief

12

Justice, that we believe that the language of the

13

statute can be susceptible to the interpretation that

14

there can be alternative maximum terms of imprisonment

15

for broad categories of offenders, such as recidivists

16

and non-recidivists.

17

But we don't think that it can -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that's the reason

18

you sort of pull back from a more aggressive reading,

19

because it's not as broad a category?

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, it would lead to harsh

21

results for first-time offenders and we certainly think

22

that Congress -

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but only if

24

they're subject -- only if they have some characteristic

25

that had caused the State legislature to give the higher
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

maximum, such as being the ringleader or some other

2

enhancement.

3

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, that's correct.

But

4

with regard to the text of the statute, we simply

5

believe that the text of the statute cannot be stretched

6

to accommodate the possibility of individualized maximum

7

terms of imprisonment for every offender based on the

8

potentially infinite combinations of facts that may

9

determine an offender's guidelines range.

10
11

And I think

it's important to JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are there any statutes

12

which talk about offender as opposed to "offense" in

13

this area, do you know?

14

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think probably the

15

closest analog in the criminal code, Justice Kennedy,

16

would be the statute that was at issue in RLC.

17

believe it's 18 U.S.C. 5037(c)(1)(b), which provided at

18

the time that the court was construing it that the

19

maximum -- that the sentence that a juvenile should

20

receive should be no higher than the maximum that an

21

adult offender should receive.

22

construe that statute to refer to the maximum that an

23

adult could receive under the guidelines.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I

And the court did

Well, there was also the

statute involved in the LaBonte case, where -- where the
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute said the Sentencing Commission "shall assure

2

that the sentencing guidelines specify a sentence to a

3

term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term

4

authorized for categories of defendants who have certain

5

types of prior convictions."

6

MR. SHANMUGAM:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.
And that did focus on the

8

-- on the nature of the defendant and not on the element

9

of the crime.

10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

It focused on categories of

11

offenders and there Congress's concern was obviously

12

with career offenders.

13

LaBonte opinion itself, written by Justice Thomas for

14

the Court, the Court recognized the possibility that a

15

statute could establish alternative maximum terms of

16

imprisonment for recidivist and nonrecidivist offenders.

17

The Court specifically discussed the Controlled

18

Substances Act, which does exactly that.

19

sure the language of that statute was somewhat

20

different, but in our view the critical lesson of

21

LaBonte is simply that it is possible for a statute to

22

establish alternative maximums and the statute at issue

23

here no less than the statute at issue in LaBonte

24

accommodates that possibility.

25

But I think critically in the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, to be

So it would be easy, of
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2
3
4

course, if recidivism were an element of the crime MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, it would be easier to

accept that if a State JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- for a crime which

5

includes the act plus the recidivism?

6

MR. SHANMUGAM:

If a State, Justice Scalia

7

were to essentially define a new crime of drug

8

trafficking by a recidivist, then to be sure by

9

definition the maximum sentence for that offense would

10

be the maximum to which repeat offenders were subject.

11

But to say one more thing in response to the Chief

12

Justice's question about guidelines maximums, I do think

13

that it is critical to remember that Congress enacted

14

the ACCA in its present form in 1986, well before this

15

Court's Apprendi jurisprudence took root, and at that

16

time Congress surely would have conceived of the

17

relevant maximum as the offense-specific statutory

18

maximum, and we know that Congress viewed that maximum

19

as a discrete creature from the relevant guidelines

20

maximum because in passing the Sentencing Reform Act 2

21

years earlier, the statute that gave rise to the Federal

22

guidelines, Congress smoke specifically about statutory

23

maximums as distinct from guidelines maximums.

24

certainly we believe -

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

In light of Apprendi and the
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

later cases, do you think it's feasible any longer to

2

draw a distinction between, between statutes that make

3

recidivism an element of the offense and statutes that

4

originally conceived of recidivism as a sentencing

5

factor but now provide for that to be proven to a jury?

6

MR. SHANMUGAM:

One of the virtues of our

7

approach, Justice Alito, is that the answer is in some

8

sense the same whether a legislature defines drug

9

trafficking by a recidivist as a distinct offense or

10

whether recidivism is simply a sentencing factor that

11

gives rise to an alternative maximum term of

12

imprisonment for the underlying offense of drug

13

trafficking.

14

to the Court's Apprendi line of cases is simply that it

15

alters nothing with regard to how the ACCA should be

16

interpreted because, again, Congress was defining

17

"offense" in 1986 in its colloquial sense as essentially

18

what the legislature defines the offense to be.

19

be sure, it is a prerequisite for a fact to be an

20

offense element that it be submitted to the jury, but

21

all this court did in Apprendi line of cases was

22

effectively to state a procedural constitutional rule

23

under which a sentencing factor that raises the

24

applicable maximum sentence has to be submitted to the

25

jury.

And our fundamental submission with regard

10
Alderson Reporting Company

And to

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Shanmugam, I didn't

2

understand what you said about Congress's intent with

3

regard to the guidelines when it passed ACCA.

4

saying Congress did not have an eye to the guidelines,

5

but simply had an eye to the maximum sentence within

6

which the guidelines were applicable?

7

MR. SHANMUGAM:

You're

Yes, that's correct.

In the

8

Federal system, that would of course be the statutory

9

maximum.

In some State systems, of course, the

10

guidelines are themselves statutory and for that reason

11

we refer to them in our brief as offense-specific

12

maximums.

13

Sentencing Reform Act is that Congress did believe that

14

there was such a thing as the maximum for the offense,

15

and indeed in Section 994(r) of Title 28, one of the

16

provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress

17

actually asked the Sentencing Commission to come back

18

with recommendations to alter those offense-specific

19

maximums, which we believe is certainly evidence that

20

Congress viewed that as something distinct.

21

But the critical point with regard to the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does it matter what was

22

the sentence actually imposed in the State court?

23

is, suppose it is a second offense, but the prosecutor

24

chooses not to charge as a second offender and so,

25

although it is in fact the second offense, he is
11
Alderson Reporting Company

That

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sentenced in the State court as a first offender.

2

it count under your reading of the Federal statute that

3

it was a second offense?

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Would

Our position, Justice

5

Ginsburg, is that it would count because the relevant

6

inquiry is whether the offender was potentially eligible

7

for an enhanced maximum sentence as a repeat offender as

8

a substantive matter.

9

certainly believe that in the mine run of cases a court

That having been said, we

10

applying the ACCA will merely need to resort to the

11

judgments of conviction or other judicial records in

12

order to determine the maximum to which the defendant

13

was actually subject.

14

a perfect example of that because the judgments for each

15

of Respondent's prior convictions made clear that he was

16

in fact subject to a 10-year maximum sentence as a

17

repeat offender.

18

And this case of course presents

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I take it -- supposing

19

there's a dispute between the prosecutor and the

20

defendant as to whether in fact he was a recidivist or

21

not.

22

he would be a recidivist enough or does the record have

23

to establish that he was a recidivist?

24

MR. SHANMUGAM:

25

Is the fact that there was just an argument that

Well, if there were such a

dispute, certainly we believe, first of all, that ACCA
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

courts would be perfectly competent to resolve those

2

disputes.

3

of legal and factual issues -

4

They are no different in kind from the sorts

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Shouldn't the mere

5

existence of a dispute be enough, because then at least

6

he's potentially subject to being treated as a

7

recidivist.

8
9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, our view, Justice

Stevens, is that once the government comes forward, for

10

example, with a judgment of conviction that indicates

11

that the defendant was subject to a 10-year maximum, it

12

would then be incumbent on the defendant to come forward

13

with evidence suggesting that that was erroneous to the

14

extent that a defendant would be permitted to

15

collaterally challenge that prior sentence at all.

16

we do believe that courts can resolve those disputes.

17

Now, if the Court were to disagree and to

But

18

conclude that, for comparable reasons to the reasons

19

that the Court articulated in Shepard, it would be

20

difficult for courts to resolve those determinations,

21

then I suppose that we could live with a rule that said

22

that the government is limited to judicial records like

23

a judgment of conviction.

24

course were dealing with a quite different concern, the

25

concern of how to define the prior offense, and I would

But Taylor and Shepard of

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

submit that the factual disputes that the Court was

2

concerned about in Shepard are quite different from

3

disputes about the applicability of a recidivism

4

enhancement.

5

underlying facts of the underlying substantive offense

6

itself.

7

portion of Justice Souter's opinion that resolving those

8

sorts of factual disputes might raise constitutional

9

concerns.

10

Those were disputes about the actual

And the Court suggested in the plurality

But we certainly believe that by virtue of

11

the rule of Almendarez-Torres, at a minimum the

12

resolution of factual disputes ancillary to the fact of

13

a prior conviction fall within the scope of the

14

Almendarez-Torres rule and present no constitutional

15

difficulties.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Shanmugam, I take it

17

that your response to Justice Ginsburg's question would

18

basically be your response to the argument that the

19

other side makes, that on your theory a State

20

misdemeanor can be treated for purposes of the act as -

21

or a conviction for a State misdemeanor can, with the

22

recidivism enhancement, be treated as a felony?

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes.

That issue would

24

arise, of course, only under the definition of "violent

25

felony," which sets a one-year trigger rather than the
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ten-year trigger that is contained in the definition of

2

"serious drug offense."

3

I think that the only point that I would

4

note is that, with regard to an offense that remains a

5

misdemeanor, even when it is committed by a repeat

6

offender, there is a distinct statutory provision which

7

we cite in our reply brief, 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(20), which

8

tinkers with the definition of what constitutes a

9

qualifying offense for purposes of the definition of

10

"violent felony."

11

the sentence, the applicable sentence, actually has to

12

be two years or more.

13

that when you commit an offense and it becomes a felony

14

when you are a recidivist, then certainly we think that

15

there is no problem with treating such an offense as an

16

ACCA predicate for purposes of the triggering maximum

17

term of imprisonment.

18

It says that if it's a misdemeanor,

But where a State actually says

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if they continue to use

19

just the State terminology such that they continue to

20

use the word "misdemeanor" with respect to an offense,

21

which with the enhancement carries more than a one-year

22

penalty, then the two-year provision, the two-year

23

threshold provision, kicks in?

24
25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That's absolutely correct,

Justice Souter, and I believe that that was actually the
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fact pattern that was presented in the ACCA case that

2

this Court heard earlier this term, Logan.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes.
And in a footnote in its

5

opinion, the Court noted this very peculiarity of how

6

ACCA operates and how you need to have a two-year

7

maximum rather than a one-year maximum if the State

8

still treats the offense as a misdemeanor.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do all States treat first

10

convictions from other States -- do they all count for

11

recidivism qualification if the prior offense was

12

committed and the conviction was in another State?

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

States do have somewhat

14

different rules, Justice Ginsburg, as Respondent

15

correctly points out, though I would note that many of

16

the sort of factual and legal issues that would arise

17

under those different rules arise outside the

18

drug-trafficking context.

19

recidivism provisions, as least those States that have

20

adopted the Uniform Controlled Substances Act provision,

21

operate in a quite straightforward manner because they

22

essentially sweep in all prior drug offenses.

23

Most States' drug-trafficking

That having been said, we are unaware of any

24

ACCA cases that have presented those sorts of

25

difficulties.

And typically what one would find, if one
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

looked at Respondent's cases, is that most States by now

2

have fairly clearly defined rules for determining when

3

an out-of-State conviction qualifies.

4

if it were unclear from the judgment of the prior

5

conviction whether the prior sentencing court had

6

determined whether the defendant was subject to the

7

enhanced maximum as a recidivist, it would be a

8

relatively easy task for a Federal ACCA court to apply

9

those largely settled rules in order to make that

10

And so at most,

determination.

11

I do want to say one more thing about the

12

text of the ACCA more generally, and that is that if the

13

Court, as Justice Scalia had suggested at the outset,

14

were to conclude that the statute is susceptible to the

15

interpretation that there can be only a single maximum

16

term of imprisonment for a given offense, we believe

17

that it would not necessarily follow that Respondent's

18

interpretation is correct, and indeed that the more

19

natural consequence of that interpretation would be that

20

the relevant maximum is the maximum that any offender

21

could receive, rather than the maximum that a first-time

22

offender could receive, and that is because -

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

Mr. Shanmugam.

25

earlier.

Surely not,

You were talking about broad categories

It seemed that the broad category in the
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

situation you posit would be the normal offender rather

2

than the recidivist, and that's the one we ought to look

3

at.

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, that might be true as

5

a numerical matter, though, you know, I suspect that

6

there are probably more recidivist offenders than one

7

might think.

8

difficulty with Respondent's interpretation is the

9

anomaly that I identified at the outset, namely that

But I think that the fundamental

10

even an offender who actually received a term of

11

imprisonment of 10 years could be said to have a maximum

12

of 5 years.

13

And while it is true that CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I know, but

14

you began your discussion by saying we had to choose one

15

maximum.

16

to me, if that's the case, it's clear that we ought to

17

pick the maximum for the particular offense without

18

considering additional enhancements.

19

You were accepting that requirement.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

It seems

Well, with respect,

20

Mr. Chief Justice, I would disagree.

21

that if the Court has to choose a single maximum it has

22

to be the maximum that the worst offender could receive.

23

As a matter of common sense, when one thinks about the

24

maximum -

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
18
Alderson Reporting Company

I would submit

But you don't accept

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that approach when we're talking about enhancements

2

under State guidelines.

3

sentence is whatever it is, 10 years, and you get an

4

extra 2 years if you're the ringleader, you say no, you

5

don't look at that; you just look at the 10 years.

6

You know, if the normal

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That's correct, and that's

7

because of the statute's reference to the offense and

8

not the offender.

9

the Court thinks that the statute is susceptible to the

But my submission is simply that if

10

interpretation that there has to be one maximum and

11

indeed if the Court thinks that that interpretation is

12

compelled, then we would submit that all offenders who

13

commit an offense for which some offenders could receive

14

a 10-year sentence would be subject to the ACCA.

15

of course primarily submit that the statute is not only

16

susceptible to the interpretation that we advance here,

17

but that it is the better interpretation, namely that a

18

statute can have alternative maximums.

19

believe that that interpretation is consistent with the

20

long history and widespread practice of imposing

21

enhanced penalties on repeat offenders, a practice that

22

Congress surely was aware of when it enacted this

23

statute dealing with the problem of recidivism.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But we

And we certainly

Mr. Shanmugam, would you

explain to me again why -- why you treat the enhancement

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in a State guideline system differently?

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

It is -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It seems to me that if you

4

get an enhancement as a ringleader it's the same thing

5

as if you get an enhancement because you're a

6

recidivist.

7

What's the difference?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

The difference, Justice

8

Scalia, is that the statute does speak of maximum terms

9

of imprisonment for the offense and not the offender,

10

and, while we certainly believe that the language of the

11

statute with its reference to "a maximum term of

12

imprisonment" can naturally accommodate the possibility

13

of alternative maximums for broad tiers of offenders

14

such as recidivists and nonrecidivists, we really don't

15

believe that it can accommodate the possibility of

16

individualized maximums for every offender.

17
18
19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You don't think

"ringleader" is a broad tier.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, in a sentencing

20

guidelines system where being a ringleader may be the

21

basis for an enhancement, as it is in the Federal

22

system, the fact remains that an enhancement under a

23

guidelines system is merely one of many factors that

24

ultimately determine the offender's guideline sentence.

25

A guideline sentence is, of course, an individualized

1

determination made after a court evaluates a panoply of

2

offender- and offense-specific factors.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

4

How would you treat an

enhancement -

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, we believe that such

6

an enhancement could be subject to our alternative

7

maximums approach as well, to the extent that the

8

standard was -

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So it's not just

10

recidivist and non-recidivist.

11

but not all enhancements?

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

It's some enhancements,

Well, if a statute is as a

13

formal matter structured in such a way as to create

14

broad tiers of punishment for categories of offenders,

15

then certainly that would seem to be an alternative

16

maximum term of imprisonment.

17

course, are not structured in that way.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19

The guideline systems, of

You're depending upon the

guidelines.

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Right.

Well, that's

21

correct, and so in Apprendi, of course, I think it was

22

the fact that the defendant had acted with a biased

23

purpose, and that form of structuring of statutes was

24

not unheard of prior to this Court's decision in

25

Apprendi.

And essentially what New Jersey did, as I
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

recall, in Apprendi was to say that if you unlawfully

2

possess a firearm your maximum is 10 years.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, I understand, but my

4

point is I don't think your proposal just has two

5

categories.

6

kinds of enhancements that would fit your general

7

description.

8
9
10
11
12

There -- it seems there could be multiple

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And the relevant question,

Justice Stevens JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's not just recidivist

versus nonrecidivist.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

This case does not present

13

that issue; and, in light of the history and practice of

14

imposing heightened penalties on recidivists, an

15

essentially universal practice as far as we're aware in

16

the drug-trafficking context, we certainly don't believe

17

that the Court has to address that issue.

18

And, in any event, after this Court's

19

decision in Apprendi, it is certainly true that States

20

have made modifications to the structure of their

21

offenses and their sentencing systems such that, with

22

regard to factors other than recidivism, it may very

23

well be that as a prospective matter that issue would

24

not arise very frequently.

25

And -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, some of them have

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

simply said, we're going to let the jury decide.

2

going to let the jury make these determinations that

3

Apprendi says have to be made by the jury.

4

still -- they're still referred to as sentencing

5

factors.

6

MR. SHANMUGAM:

We're

But they're

That's correct, Justice

7

Scalia.

And, with regard to a State that does that as

8

Washington, indeed, has done in the wake of this Court's

9

decision in Blakely, we believe that the relevant

10

offense and the relevant maximum term of imprisonment

11

actually remains the same.

12

And that is simply because where all a State

13

does is to say that sentencing factors must be submitted

14

to the jury in order to comply with the constitutional

15

rule of Apprendi and Blakely, the fact remains that the

16

State has not redefined the offense.

17

sentencing factor can remain a sentencing factor even if

18

it is the functional equivalent of an offense element

19

for Apprendi purposes.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In our view, a

It seems to me your

21

argument might be slightly better if the statutory term

22

was "authorized," not "prescribed."

23

"prescribed" could never be used in the sense you mean,

24

but when you have alternates we usually would use the

25

word -- alternate possibilities -- usually you'd use the
23
Alderson Reporting Company

I don't say

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

word "authorize" rather than "prescribe."

2

indicates one rule.

3

MR. SHANMUGAM:

"Prescribe"

I suppose that may be true,

4

Justice Kennedy, though again the statute spoke about

5

the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense, which

6

I think presupposes, at least to some extent, that the

7

maximum may be higher than the maximum to which a

8

particular offender is subject.

9

I think the only thing I would say with

10

regard to the reference to "prescribed by law" in the

11

ACCA is that one could naturally understand that phrase

12

being used by a Congress that was acting in 1986 as

13

referring to the prescribed statutory maximum.

14

And, notably, the Ninth Circuit in a case

15

that we cite in our opening brief, United States v.

16

Parry, construed that phrase in exactly that manner in

17

actually holding that, notwithstanding its rule in this

18

case, the applicable maximum for a defendant sentenced

19

under a mandatory guidelines system cannot be the

20

applicable guidelines maximum; It has to be the maximum

21

for the offense.

22

erred only insofar as it thought that that maximum is

23

the maximum to which first-time offenders were subject,

24

even for a repeat offender.

25

We believe that the Ninth Circuit

Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

balance of my time.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I ask you one question

3

before you sit down?

You mentioned a moment ago what

4

you saw as the anomaly in the counter-argument, the

5

anomaly being that someone with the recidivism

6

enhancement could end up with a ten-year sentence when

7

the maximum for the offense is five years.

8

isn't the answer to that just as -- as the answer that

9

you gave to Justice Scalia a moment ago, and that is

But isn't -

10

simply that the statute speaks in terms of "offense" so

11

that there is -- there is no anomaly in getting a

12

ten-year sentence for something which for this purpose

13

carries a maximum of five?

14

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Souter, an enhanced

15

penalty for repeat offenders is every bit as much a

16

penalty for the offense as the lower penalty for

17

first-time offenders.

18
19
20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's the question

in the case.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, and that is a question

21

that this Court has answered in a variety of different

22

contexts dating back almost a hundred years to Graham v.

23

West Virginia.

24

is certainly equally applicable here, and a penalty for

25

a recidivist, while in some sense holding a recidivist

And we would submit that that principle

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

more responsible by virtue of his or her recidivist

2

status, is every bit as much a penalty for the offense.

3

And under our alternative maximums approach that can be

4

the maximum for the underlying offense.

5

I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10
11
12

MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, counsel.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
There are a number of serious problems with

13

the government's theory in this case, and I'll start

14

with this one.

15

language of ACCA, as is suggested by the R.L.C. and

16

LaBonte decisions that have been discussed already; and

17

it cannot be reconciled with the fundamental purpose of

18

ACCA, which is reflected in that statutory language.

19

It is inconsistent with the statutory

Congress enacted ACCA to target particular

20

categories of serious offenses.

21

is a repeat offender says nothing at all about the

22

seriousness of the offense that he committed and

23

therefore tells us nothing about whether that offense

24

should be treated as an ACCA -

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Whether the defendant

Suppose the State has two
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statutes:

2

years; possession of drugs by a convicted felon, maximum

3

-- convicted drug felon, maximum penalty ten years.

4

a defendant is convicted under the latter provision.

5

What would be the maximum penalty for ACCA purposes?

6

Possession of drugs, maximum penalty five

MR. ROTHFELD:

And

Well, if that latter

7

provision includes as an element of the offense that

8

recidivism, that could be a different situation than we

9

have here, because the statutory language of ACCA, as

10

Mr. Shanmugam said, focuses on "offense."

11

that an ACCA predicate in the drug context is an offense

12

for which a maximum penalty of ten years or more is -

13
14
15

Congress said

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, it could be or it

MR. ROTHFELD:

I think that's a difficult

would be?

16

question, Your Honor, which is not the question here.

I

17

suppose I would say the language would suggest that it

18

would be; that if it is an element to the offense the

19

defendant has been convicted of an offense that includes

20

recidivism as an element, that statutory language would

21

lead us in that direction.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if the maximum penalty

23

there would be ten years, then what if in this case the

24

recidivist element had been submitted to a jury and

25

found by a jury.

Would it matter?
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ROTHFELD:

I would suggest, again, it

2

depends upon what the element defined by the State

3

legislature is in creating the offense, because that

4

follows from the ACCA term of the offense, the

5

punishment prescribed by law for the offense.

6

of course, not the question here.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

That is,

And it's -

Why should the label matter?

8

Maybe as to statutes that were passed before Apprendi

9

and Booker, that at that time it made a difference.

10

But, going forward, what difference does it make whether

11

it's labelled as an element of the offense or a

12

sentencing enhancement that's proven to a jury?

13

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think in the

14

post-Blakely context one could say something that has to

15

be proven to a jury is in fact an element of the

16

offense.

17

terms of the sentencing guidelines elements at that

18

point.

19

The offence may essentially be defined in

But I think in figuring what Congress had in

20

mind when it used the term defining "ACCA serious drug

21

offense" as "an offense for which a maximum penalty of

22

ten years is prescribed by law, we have to figure out

23

what is the offense and what is the penalty prescribed

24

by law for that.

MR. ROTHFELD:

But the reason for that, Your

MR. ROTHFELD:

by Justice Scalia's latest question, which is that there

is a difference between the offense and the offender.

As Mr. Shanmugam said -- and we agree

completely -- ACCA is an offense-specific provision.

It asks:

25

You're asking -- you've got three previous

If recidivism is what you're trying to

2

States now, with the three strikes regime becoming

3

ubiquitous, in which all that matters is basically the

4

number of offenses that were committed.

5

expressly disavow the seriousness of the offenses that

6

constitute the predicates in those kind of regime.

7

There are recidivism statutes common in the

The States

ACCA is different kind of statute.

ACCA was

8

motivated because Congress was concerned that there was

9

a small cohort of offenders who are engaging repeatedly

10

in serious offenses, and Congress had in mind that

11

people who engaged repeatedly in these especially

12

threatening, dangerous, harmful offenses, very

13

destructive to society, they should be segregated for 15

14

years through the ACCA mandatory minimum.

15

But Congress was quite clear, and the

16

statutory language reflects this expressly, that the

17

predictates have to themselves be serious offenses.

18

Congress was concerned with what people did.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but it just

20

seems to me that if you have Congress addressing what

21

they regarded as a very serious problem of recidivism,

22

they would think that that's a problem that should be

23

taken into account in determining what maximum sentences

24

you're subject to under State law.

25

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, they could have done
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that.

They could -- and that would have been the

2

statute the government is discussing, one which ties

3

recidivism into the particular category of the offender

4

and the penalties to which they are subject.

5

But Congress did not do that.

Congress

6

focused specifically on the seriousness of each of the

7

individual predicate offenses.

8

people actually did, whether the kinds of offenses they

9

were committing were serious destructive types of

10

And it had in mind what

offenses.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it did use the

12

language "a maximum term," not "the maximum term," which

13

would support the government's view that the statute

14

contemplates more than one maximum.

15

MR. ROTHFELD:

With respect, Your Honor, I

16

would suggest that's one of the government's odder

17

arguments.

18

use of "the" rather than "the" in this context is quite

19

peculiar.

20

pronouncing sentencing he or she is likely to say "I

sentence you to a term of 10 years," not "I sentence you

22

to the term of 10 years."

23

I think that reading any significance to the

I would think if a judge, for example, is

Certainly the use of "I sentence you to a

multiple alternative regimes of punishment.

Alderson Reporting Company

So I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

the government, I give them kudos for creativity there,

2

but I think it's very difficult to read any conscious

3

choice by Congress in the use of the different article.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Counsel, you -

What about the

6

defendant's own understanding?

In connection with one

7

of these offenses the defendant acknowledged in court,

8

the crime with which I am charged carries a maximum

9

sentence of 10 years.

10

MR. ROTHFELD:

11

things to say about that, Your Honor.

12

question how seriously anyone took that statement in the

13

sentencing declaration, because what really mattered in

14

Washington State was the binding determinant sentencing

15

guideline, which set a maximum term of 57 months, which

16

everyone agrees was the highest penalty this defendant

17

could receive.

18

aggravating circumstances, which are not present in this

19

case, no one convicted of this defendant's crime could

20

receive a punishment, recidivist or not, of 10 years,

21

enough to trigger the ACCA predicate.

22

I think that there are two
First of all, I

In fact, it's quite clear that, absent

So, I question again whether or not anyone

23

took that terribly seriously.

But I think even if one

24

did, it doesn't answer the question here.

25

question that there was a recidivism provision which, at
34
Alderson Reporting Company

There is no

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

least in some theoretical sense, made the maximum

2

penalty 10 years.

3

which defined the crime.

4

statutory provision the Washington legislature

5

specifically associated with conviction of that offense

6

a five-year maximum penalty.

7

it sort of begs the question to say, as the government

8

does, well, the fact that there is some possibility out

9

there of an enhancement that increases the penalty above

There is also a statutory provision
And in that -- in that

And I think it sort of -

10

10 years, even if that were true, which is not, again

11

because of the sentencing guidelines in this case, that

12

sort of begs the question of what is the relevant

13

offense?

14

the generic categorical offense of distribution of

15

Schedule 3, 4, or 5 drugs, the sentence to which anyone

16

convicted of that crime, anyone who engaged in the

17

elements of that offense and is found guilty in

18

Washington State could have been sentenced to, and that

19

is 5 years.

20

Is the relevant offense what you might call

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The government is correct,

21

though, that when a recidivist is sentenced he is being

22

punished for the crime, not for his recidivism.

23

you -- you can say that the punishment for that defined

24

crime is 10 years when, when the person who committed

25

the act is a recidivist, but the act he's being punished
35
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for is the same crime.

2

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, there is no doubt about

3

that.

The defendant here committed this offense and he

4

is being punished for it, for that offense.

5

I think that begs the question here:

6

the term "the punishment prescribed by law for the

7

offense," what did it have in mind?

8

the generic sense of the offense in the sense of the

9

offense that anyone commits who is guilty or who commits

10

the elements of the offense, which is someone who is not

11

a recidivist.

12

to that because recidivism is not an element of this

13

offense.

14

But again,

When Congress uses

Did it mean sort of

It's entirely -- recidivism is unrelated

So yes, the defendant here committed the

15

offense.

He's being punished for having committed this

16

offense.

But that doesn't answer the question of what

17

Congress had in mind.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the part I'm not

19

getting.

I mean, that's why it doesn't help your

20

client.

21

as applying just to the act of selling drugs, let's say,

22

then you go on and it says, for which a maximum term of

23

10 years or more is prescribed, you'd say, well what is

24

the maximum term prescribed for the offense of selling

25

drugs?

In general, if you did read the word "offense"

I'm not sure that's the case.

The fact that the

State sees multiple offenders, repeat offenders, in its

11

community means that they have to spend extra resources

12

to prevent -- to incarcerate them because they have a

The question is when Congress wrote this

The recidivism enhancement is

MR. ROTHFELD:

But -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I think,

following up on Justice Kennedy's question, that you

would assume that this Congress thought that recidivists

the one particular offense.

10

MR. ROTHFELD:

It is that recidivism

12

recidivism statute different in character from the

13

three-strikes kind of statute, different in character

14

from the -- the drug recidivism statute in Washington

quite clear in the cases that are -- and we agree by

cases cited by the Government for this proposition 43

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that when you are sentenced as a recidivist to a higher

2

penalty you are being punished for the most recent

3

offense that you were -- that you were -

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, if you were

5

representing a -- a defendant who has two prior

6

convictions for something that has a sentence of 8

7

years, and on the third one he is subject to a sentence

8

of 15 years; and your initial meeting, the first thing

9

he wants to know is what's the maximum that I'm facing?

10

Would you tell him it's 8 years or would you tell him

11

it's 15 years?

12

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I would say that

13

because you are a recidivist the maximum you are facing

14

is 15 years.

15

you committed is a more serious offense because you are

16

a repeat offender.

17

illustrates this very nicely.

18

the Court construed in LaBonte it referred to the

19

maximum term of imprisonment for specified categories of

20

defendants; and the Court found that language was

21

crucial because it showed that Congress contemplated

that there would be different terms of imprisonment for

It's JUSTICE SOUTER:

this argument?

13

MR. ROTHFELD:

We do not.

I think one way

14

to consider the case is that there in fact are three

15

statutes which bear on the question of penalty.

16

is the statute that created the crime of conviction,

17

which created the -- the offense of a distribution of a

schedule of 3, 4, or 5 drugs, and in that statute

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, the

2

Government of course responds to your rule of lenity

3

argument by saying it loses a lot of its force when we

4

are talking about how -- the degree of sentencing rather

5

than whether conduct is subject to a criminal sanction

6

in the first place.

7

MR. ROTHFELD:

They do say that, Your Honor,

8

and I think that's simply not so.

I mean, the Court has

9

said repeatedly and has applied repeatedly the doctrine

10

that the rule of lenity applies when the only question

11

is the length of the sentence; and indeed the R.L.C.

12

case which the Government has been discussing was a case

13

which involved only a question of length of the sentence

14

and -

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But someone who is,

16

you know, we are trying to decide whether he is subject

17

to 20 years in jail or 30 years in jail, invoking the

18

rule of lenity is a little bit -- it's not the same as

19

somebody who comes in and says I didn't know this was a

20

crime at all, because it's so vaguely written.

21

MR. ROTHFELD:

I think the Court has said

22

consistently that one of the elements supporting the

23

rule of lenity is the idea that somebody's liberty is

24

going to be taken away, that Congress should have

25

spoken, to some degree 46

number of cases in our briefs, the Bifulco case -- but

16

the R.L.C. case, which both parties have discussed at

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It is -- it is a

fundamental verbal embarrassment for your argument that

you would say in a particular case that the maximum to

21

which someone is subject is say, 5 years, and that

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. ROTHFELD: -- I think it's -- it's

4

entirely a question of how you take the congressional

5

meaning of the term punishment prescribed for the

6

offense.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but I thought your

8

position was that the -- the defendant is not, this

9

defendant is not subject to a maximum of 5 years, but

10

gets 10.

I thought your position was that the offense

11

within the meaning of the statute should be an offense

14

MR. ROTHFELD:

offense which carried in its weight recidivism, and so I

10

would say yes, in that circumstance that would be a

11

different situation than what we have here.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

It all depends whether it's

13

labelled an element of the offense by the State

legislature?

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think that whether it

actually is an element of the offence -- I mean, in this

-- that, I agree with you, that won't work because of

they're saying here is it's right in the statute.

guidelines reductions into effect.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the

You see that my question is

7

going in the exact opposite way.

What I am finding hard

8

is once you distinguish offender and offense

9

characteristics in the way you do, why not jump to the

10

max for the offense?

And so I'm asking you, how is it

11

you get out of that?

Which is the same question I had

before.

13

other cases.

14

I'm not so worried about your case as I am

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, the way -- the way we

15

resolve that, Justice Breyer, is what was suggested by

16

Justice Souter's question.

17

was the offense without the overlay of a recidivism

18

enhancement, which is not an element of this offense.

19

One looks at the offense, one looks at the commission of

20

the elements, if you commit the elements, what does that

21

subject -- what kind of punishment does that subject you

22

to?

23

If you have to call into the mix enhancements that are

24

unrelated, that are offender-specific and not

25

offense-specific, that's falls out because that's not

What Congress had in mind

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

what Congress had in mind when it referred to

2

"punishment prescribed by law for the offense."

3

Again, Congress had in mind a limited series of serious

4

offenses.

5

they engaged in the kind of serious, harmful,

6

destructive conduct that was sufficiently bad to trigger

7

the mandatory 15-year sentence, and if they did not, the

8

fact that some additional overlay could be used to

9

enhance their sentence is not what Congress was

10

concerned about when it listed ACCA predicates.

11

It was looking at what people did, whether

And, again, I don't want to fall away from

12

the Sentencing Guidelines point because, as I understood

13

Mr. Shanmugam's explanation to Justice Scalia as to why

14

the Guidelines should not apply if enhancement does is

15

because, well, this is an offender-specific -- an

16

offense-specific crime, and Congress at the time that it

17

enacted ACCA had in mind that guidelines in the

18

statutory regime were different.

19

But so far as the -- the offense has been

20

defined by the -- by the statute, the relevant offense

21

here is the five-year penalty associated with that

22

offense.

23

beyond that and say we are going to look for things that

24

are outside of the offense, not in the elements of the

25

offense, to increase the sentence, as the government

And so I think that if one is going to go

Alderson Reporting Company

does with the recidivism statute, there is no reason

2

why, if we are prepared to go outside of the offense

elements, that one wouldn't go to the Guidelines as

well, which have precisely the same effect in the other

5

way.

6

a one-way ratchet that if it increases the offense

7

level, that's okay, but if it decreases the punishment

for some reason, that doesn't apply.

see any principled basis for that.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2
3
4

Justice.
There are just two points that I'd like to
make in rebuttal:
The first is that the government believes

5

that the rule of lenity is inapplicable here for the

6

simple reason that we believe that the text of the

7

statute is not susceptible to Respondent's

8

interpretation.

9

statute does permit the interpretation that a given

And if the Court concludes that the

10

offense can have only a single maximum term of

11

imprisonment, we believe that the only logical

12

conclusion is that that maximum is the maximum that any

13

offender could receive, not that the maximum -- not that

14

it is the maximum that some better-positioned subset of

15

offenders could receive.

16

the considerations that underlie the rule of lenity have

17

less force in this context, and the Court has never

18

applied the rule of lenity to the ACCA, we ultimately

19

believe that the fact that the text does not permit

20

Respondent's interpretation is the end of the inquiry.

21

And while we do believe that

The other point that I would just make is

22

that if this Court were to adopt Respondent's

23

interpretation, it would have pernicious consequences,

24

not only for the ACCA, but likely also for a number of

25

other critically important Federal statutes as well.
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

With regard to the ACCA itself, both the definition of

2

"serious drug offense" and the definition of "violent

3

felony" are framed in terms of the maximum term of

4

imprisonment for the offense, and at least 28 States and

5

the Federal Government have drug-trafficking offenses

6

that would qualify as ACCA predicates for repeat

7

offenders under the government's interpretation but not

8

under Respondent's.

9

similar language appears -

10

And with regard to other statutes

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's good or bad,

11

depending upon whether -- whether your interpretation of

12

the statute is right or the other side's.

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

people in jail?

16

we're after.

17

Well It's good to put more

I mean, that isn't necessarily what

We're -

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I mean only to highlight the

18

practical significance of this issue, Justice Scalia,

19

and again, certainly in enacting a statute that itself

20

deals with the problem of recidivism, we believe that

21

Congress would not have wanted to be insensitive to an

22

offender's past recidivism.

23

But with regard to other statutes, I want to

24

note that similar language also appears in the Federal

25

three-strikes law and in the Controlled Substances Act,
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

which along with the ACCA, are among the most important

2

Federal statutes dealing with a problem of recidivism.

3

And similar language also appears in a number of general

4

Federal criminal statutes, including RICO and the very

5

substantive statute at issue here, the felony possession

6

statute.

7

Circuit's interpretation, it could potentially lead to

8

the narrowing of all of those statutes as well.

9

Ninth Circuit, alone among the circuits, has adopted

And if this Court were to adopt the Ninth

The

10

this view that the relevant maximum for an offense must

11

be the maximum that first-time offenders receive.

12

believe that that is erroneous and that the judgment of

13

the Ninth Circuit should be reversed.

14

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
