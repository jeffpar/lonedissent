Mr. Guerra.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. GUERRA

7

10

We'll hear argument

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GUERRA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The government claims in this case that

11

Congress decided to treat retaliation against Federal

12

workers who complain of age discrimination differently

13

than every other species of retaliatory conduct, that

14

for age-based retaliation alone Congress created a

15

four-part patchwork scheme in which a small cadre of

16

Federal employees have a full judicial remedy, but tens

17

of thousands of others who suffer retaliatory conduct

18

have absolutely no remedies at all.

19

This scheme is inconsistent with over three

20

decades of administrative interpretations by the

21

agencies charged with administering and enforcing the

22

statute and it is flatly inconsistent, most importantly,

23

with the plain language and historical origins of the

24

statute itself.

25

bars retaliation against covered workers who have

By its plain terms, Section 633a(a)

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

complained that have they suffered age discrimination.

2

Such retaliation is directed at persons over -

3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

By its plain

terms?

5

MR. GUERRA:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. GUERRA:

Read it to me, would you?

The provision is:

"All

8

personnel actions shall be made" -- "affecting covered

9

employees shall be made free from any discrimination

10
11

based on age."
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is retaliation

12

discrimination based on age?

13

that it ought to be covered, but to say that the plain

14

language covers it, I mean that's extraordinary.

15

plain language doesn't cover it.

16

MR. GUERRA:

I can see your argument

The

With respect, Justice Scalia, I

17

submit it does cover it for at least three reasons.

18

First of all discrimination -- retaliatory conduct aimed

19

at a 40-year-old or someone over age 40 because he or

20

she is asserting rights she possesses by virtue of being

21

age 40 or older is discrimination based on age.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, it's not.

I

23

mean, a company could have a policy of firing everybody

24

who complains about anything and the fact that a worker

25

is over the age of 40 and is fired does not mean that he
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

is being fired because of age.
MR. GUERRA:

Mr. Chief Justice, the issue in

3

this case is whether plaintiff is entitled to allege and

4

ultimately prove that she was -- she suffered adverse

5

personnel actions because she complained of age

6

discrimination.

7

certain case the employer could demonstrate that in fact

8

the retaliatory conduct was not triggered by the nature

9

of the complaint, and in fact there have been Title VII

It may be that in some, that in a

10

cases where the courts have found that it was the manner

11

in which a complaint was lodged, that there was, that

12

there was false statements or it was too inflammatory,

13

and so the employer prevailed.

14

But if -- the issue here is whether, if

15

Ms. Gomez can prove ultimately that the retaliatory

16

conduct was a function of the fact that as a 40-year-old

17

she was asserting her rights to be free from age

18

discrimination, we submit that is covered by the plain

19

language of the statute.

20

court's interpretation of Title IX in the Jackson case

21

because there the Court -

22

And that is confirmed by this

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of course the

23

statute that covers age discrimination in the private

24

sector does have an express provision addressing

25

retaliation.

The one that governs Federal employees
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

does not, and that's the government's main argument,

2

that it's expressed in the private sector, it's not

3

there in the public sector and so you shouldn't imply

4

one.

What's your answer to that?

5

MR. GUERRA:

Mr. Chief Justice, three

6

responses to that.

First of you, as this Court

7

explained in Jackson itself, it's improper to narrow the

8

scope of a stand-alone general discrimination ban that

9

does not identify any discriminatory practices based on

10

a comparison with an enumeration ban that sets forth a

11

detailed series of prohibitions.

12

the comparison that the Court rejected in Jackson and

13

the government is asking the court to draw here.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's precisely

But in Jackson it was in a

15

different statute and here it's in the same statute.

16

Surely that makes a big difference.

17

MR. GUERRA:

It doesn't in this case,

18

Justice Scalia, for two reasons.

19

subsection (f) of section 633a effectively deems the

20

private sector and the Federal sector provisions of the

21

Age Act to be the functional equivalents of two separate

22

statutes.

23

that provision.

24

government's argument -

25

First of all,

So I think that distinction is refuted by
But more fundamentally, the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not familiar with that
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

provision.

2

What does that provision say?
MR. GUERRA:

That is the provision that the

3

government cites in its brief and it provides that:

4

"Any personnel action of any department, agency, or

5

other entity referred to in subsection (a) of this

6

section shall not be subject to or affected by any

7

provision of this chapter other than the provisions of

8

Section 631b of this title."

9

position is that that provision makes these statutory

10

And the government's

schemes utterly distinct from one another.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, no.

I mean, they're

12

all in the same, in the same statute, and what that

13

provision says is that just because we give certain

14

relief in, in the portion applicable to private

15

discrimination, does not mean that we give that relief

16

in the section applicable to government discrimination,

17

where it is explicitly withheld -- it can't be

18

explicitly withheld -- where it is withheld, although

19

it's explicitly included for private discrimination.

20

think that's the only sensible way to read that

21

provision.

22

out of one.

23

I

It surely doesn't make two statutes out of,
It is simply one statute.
MR. GUERRA:

Justice Scalia, if I may, two

24

points.

One is it's clear that the scope of the

25

language of 633a(a) is broader in its own right than
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

623a, which is the -- or 623a and 623b operate in

2

conjunction with each other.

3

stand-alone prohibition in the Federal sector side is

4

intended to be broader than the -- the discrimination

5

ban of 623(a).

6

that because it sweeps more broadly and because it's not

7

limited by any other provision that operates in

8

conjunction with it, that there's no basis for drawing a

9

negative inference.

10

So we know that the

So it's not anomalous at all to conclude

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, why would Congress

11

have taken this drafting approach?

12

provisions were already in existence when it made the

13

statute applicable to Federal workers and there was a

14

specific provision prohibiting retaliation in the

15

private sector.

16

to the Federal sector, why wouldn't they have either

17

copied that or incorporated it?

18

and in fact they enacted a provision that says that the

19

private sector provisions are not incorporated unless

20

they're specifically noted.

21

ones that's noted.

22

The private sector

If Congress wanted to carry that over

MR. GUERRA:

And they did neither,

And this isn't one of the

Justice Alito, if I could -

23

the second point I was going to address to Justice

24

Scalia I think answers this, this point.

25

the exact same thing in Title VII two years earlier.
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Congress did
It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

could have added Federal employers to the definition of

2

employer and subjected them to the private sector regime

3

there, but instead it created a stand-alone prohibition.

4

If you take the government's logic in this case and

5

apply it to Title VII, it would lead to the conclusion

6

that the Federal sector ban in Title VII, which is

7

717(a), does not bar retaliation either, and yet we know

8

that's not true.

9
10

Because -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
so held.

11

Why?

This Court hasn't

We haven't had that issue before us.
MR. GUERRA:

You -- that's correct, Your

12

Honor.

13

but it's true because of the structure of the statute,

14

the consistent interpretations of the lower courts and

15

the administrative agency.

16

is, in 717(a), the language, the prohibition there is

17

virtually identical to the prohibition here except it

18

proscribes race discrimination, et cetera, instead of

19

age discrimination.

20

It's not true because of this Court's holdings,

The structure of the statute

Then, in the remedy section Congress

21

explicitly made a remedy for retaliation available for

22

violations of 717(a)'s substantive norm.

23

reason to do that was because Congress understood that

24

substantive norm to prohibit retaliation.

25

copied that very same language into 633a(a), thereby
9
Alderson Reporting Company

The only

Congress then

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

giving it the same breadth.

2

And so the negative inference theory the

3

government puts forward with respect to Title VII fails

4

on that statute because of the incorporation of the

5

remedies, we know that that prohibition bars

6

retaliation.

7

copied from that Federal sector prohibition in Title

8

VII, the same reasoning dictates that the argument fail

9

here as well.

10

And because the norm at issue here was

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The Federal

11

employee, though, has all of the remedies under the

12

Civil Service Reform Act for any type of employment

13

practice.

14

and almost impenetrable, and yet this would add

15

complication.

16

under the CSRA that says in some cases you go here, in

17

other cases you go here, and you get different types of

18

review depending on the facts, all of that would be

19

wiped away if you can bring a direct action under the

20

age discrimination statute.

21

Those remedies are elaborately reticulated

In other words, despite all the remedies

MR. GUERRA:

Three points, Mr. Chief

22

Justice:

First of all, everything you just said would

23

be equally true of discrimination under Title VII, and

24

yet the government acknowledges that retaliatory conduct

25

for race discrimination claims, sex discrimination
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

claims, can all be brought directly in court,

2

notwithstanding the existence of the CSRA.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did the government -

4

well, we'll ask the government, but I thought they kind

5

of qualified that in their brief.

6

the case -- this case presents no occasion to consider

7

whether Title VII's ban on discrimination against

8

Federal sector employees incorporates that Act's private

9

sector retaliation ban.

10

The brief says that

So they haven't made a

concession.

11

MR. GUERRA:

Well, I -- Justice Ginsburg, I

12

read them to be conceding for purposes of this case and

13

the analysis of this case, and if they're willing to

14

acknowledge, at least for purposes of this case, that

15

all these other retaliatory claims can be brought

16

outside of the CSRA regime, it makes no sense, I submit,

17

to single out retaliation based on age discrimination

18

claims.

19

And, in fact, Congress JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think you're saying even

20

if, even if that were the case, they would still urge

21

the Court to come out the way they do.

22

they're conceding that that's the case.

23

MR. GUERRA:

I don't think

But, Justice Scalia, even if -

24

if -- even if taken on the "even if" premise, you still

25

are in the situation where you have an irrational
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

distinction by saying the CSRA is the exclusive remedy

2

for retaliation for age complaints and yet not for

3

retaliation under Title VII.

4

Also, Mr. Chief Justice, the CSRA itself

5

explicitly carves out claims under the ADEA and Title

6

VII.

So, Congress did not view it as the exclusive -

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But not retaliation

8

claims.

9

you put it, may or may not be carved out, a retaliation

10

claim fits under the employment practices provisions of

11

the CSRA, regardless of the basis for retaliation.

12

other words, you took personnel action against me for an

13

impermissible basis and therefore I'm entitled to the

14

various civil service remedies.

15

In other words, although the direct claims, as

MR. GUERRA:

In

That's -- that's correct,

16

Mr. Chief Justice.

And of course, the CSRA covers

17

retaliation that has nothing to do with complaints of

18

employment discrimination as well.

19

rendered a dead letter by recognizing our position.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

21

MR. GUERRA:

So it would not be

Does it cover your client?

I don't believe it would,

22

Justice Souter, because she did not suffer an adverse

23

action.

24
25

No, and in fact putting that aside JUSTICE GINSBURG:

She could complain; it's

just that she couldn't go very far with the complaint.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. GUERRA:

Well, more fundamentally,

2

Justice Ginsburg, she's not covered at all by the CSRA.

3

And that was the third point I wanted to make.

4

excludes thousands of employees.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The CSRA

But it does that for

6

a reason.

We have a lot of cases in the Federal Circuit

7

and the D.C. Circuit that addresses a lot of these

8

problems say that when the CSRA excludes certain types

9

of claims of employees, they do it for a reason.

In

10

other words, it's not simply that they didn't cover them

11

or inadvertence, but they make the decision that the

12

remedies that they've provided don't apply in a

13

particular case.

14

excluded under the CSRA nonetheless have remedies for

15

employment practices seems to me to undermine that -

16

that judgment.

17

And to say that those people who are

MR. GUERRA:

Mr. Chief Justice, with

18

respect, the problem with the government's reliance on

19

the statute is that it doesn't -- on their view, White

20

House employees and congressional employees have a full

21

judicial remedy for retaliation suffered for raising age

22

discrimination complaints.

23

no sense to permit that one band of employees, many

24

high-level policy employee -- policymakers, to bring

25

retaliation claims in Federal court, while excluding

And our argument is it makes

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Postal Service workers who have only collective

2

bargaining rights and tens of thousands of other

3

employees for -

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

The answer is that it

5

doesn't exclude them, that they have all these

6

collective bargaining rights; they have the civil

7

service rights; they can go and bring their same claim

8

with other remedies.

9

Why should they have two rights?

10

one.

11

underlying this.

12

You could make the opposite claim:
Everybody else has

I mean, that seems to me what they're argument is

Then when you go to Title VII -- and this I

13

don't understand fully.

14

in 16(e) has a basic ban.

Look at Title VII and Title VII
Is that right?

15

MR. GUERRA:

That's correct, Justice Breyer.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then, in 16(d) it says

17

certain of those things govern Federal suits, suits

18

against the Federal Government.

19

some provisions.

20

relief against the Federal Government where there is

21

discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex,

22

or national origin.

23

3(a)."

24
25

Then it incorporates

And it says that you get that certain

Then it says "or in violation of

And then 3(a) refers to retaliation.
So it looks like Title VII does give you a

remedy, in 3(a), for retaliation.

And it's rather

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

specific, and that suggests that those other words don't

2

pick up retaliation.

3

Now, what have I missed?

4

It's rather that specific thing.

MR. GUERRA:

Justice Breyer, the -- you are

5

right to focus on these remedies, but the remedies

6

themselves are not incorporated as substantive bans.

7

They are simply remedies, and our point is by making a

8

retaliation remedy available for a violation of the ban

9

that you identified in subsection 717(a), Congress

10

necessarily understood that substantive ban, 717(a), to

11

prohibit retaliation.

12

reason to provide a remedy for retaliation as one of the

13

remedies for a violation of -

14

Otherwise there would be no

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you could say that,

15

but you could also say, well, look here in Title VII

16

Congress has some words, and these words give you a

17

specific -- if you're a Federal employee and somebody's

18

retaliating against you because you went and complained

19

about race or something, just read those words; you can

20

bring a lawsuit, right?

21

MR. GUERRA:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. GUERRA:

24
25

Am I right about that?
I don't think so No?

-- Justice Breyer.

MR. GUERRA:

3

applicant aggrieved.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

is this text that we're talking about?

6
7

MR. GUERRA:

10

It's not in the appendix.

It's not in your brief.
So I don't know what you're

talking about.
MR. GUERRA:

I am talking about subsection

(c) of 717a, the Federal sector provisions of Title VII.

13

certain what I'm talking about either.

on.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. GUERRA:

Well, I'm not totally
So we could go

I'd like to think I -- I can

20

illuminate the -- the language that authorizes Federal

21

employees to bring suits for violations of Title VII

22

says that if they are aggrieved by final disposition of

23

the complaint, they may bring a civil action under Title

24

VII, and aggrieved -- they can bring complaints for

25

violations of subsection (a), which like subsection (a)
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in our statute says "all personnel actions affecting

2

employees or applicants for employment shall be made

3

free from any discrimination based on race, color,

4

religion," et cetera.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. GUERRA:

Or in violation of -

No, it does not say that,

7

Justice Breyer.

The prohibition of subsection (a) of

8

717a in substantive terms is identical, except it

9

specifies a different protected status.

So this is a

10

ban on discrimination based on race, color, religion,

11

and you are authorized to bring a suit if you are

12

aggrieved by a violation of that provision, and one of

13

the remedies that's made available is a remedy that's

14

available for violations of the private sector provision

15

on retaliation.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why is that so clear,

17

because section 2000e, 16(d) says section, whatever it

18

is, f through k of this title, as applicable, shall

19

govern civil actions brought hereunder.

20

no right against retaliation, then the remedy wouldn't

21

be applicable.

22

MR. GUERRA:

And if there is

Justice Ginsburg, the language

23

"as applicable" I submit has to be referring to whether

24

the case itself would implicate the need for that

25

remedy.

In other words, it would not be applicable to
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have a reinstatement remedy in a case where there was no

2

discharge.

3

But the reading that you have suggested

4

assumes that Congress didn't know what it was -- the

5

scope of the prohibition it enacted in Section 717(a)

6

and was effectively saying:

7

don't know whether they apply or not, but if they do, go

8

ahead and use them.

9

Here are some remedies; we

And I submit that is an improper assumption

10

about congressional understanding of its own

11

legislation.

12

understood 717(a) to bar retaliation.

13

provided a retaliation remedy, and that assumption is

14

buttressed by the fact that, as this Court explained in

15

the Brown v. GSA case, Congress adopted Title VII

16

precisely because it found that fear of reprisal had

17

made the old scheme ineffective.

18

The proper assumption is that Congress
That's why it

So it makes perfect sense that it would want

19

to prohibit retaliation under Title VII in the Federal

20

sector because reprisals had rendered the old

21

protections useless.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, could you proceed

23

with that?

That is, a very simple way of thinking of

24

this as one possible way of reading it is that Congress

25

says:

When private employers discriminate, there can be
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

whistleblower's, and they need protection; so let's put

2

some in.

3

basis of race, there can be some whistleblower's.

4

they protect them in some States; maybe they don't

5

protect them in others.

6

Federal Government officials discriminate against on the

7

basis of race, whistleblower's should be protected.

8
9

When State officials discriminate, say, on the

We better put some in.

Maybe

When

But we have a whole system here to protect
them.

And so let's just use that system and treat all

10

whistleblower's alike, and that's the end of the matter.

11

We don't need any special protection for whistleblower's

12

here.

13

Now, the answer to that is what?

14

MR. GUERRA:

That is the very system that

15

Congress had deemed ineffective to prevent retaliation

16

for the very claims you're talking about in -- and

17

that's why it chose to adopt the amendments to Title VII

18

in 1972.

19

fact -

20

That's what the Brown case canvasses; and, in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's sort of

21

begging the question.

I mean, you're saying it's not

22

true because our interpretation of Title VII is true.

23

But the point goes to how you ought to interpret Title

24

VII.

25

retaliatory action you use your Federally prescribed

That is, it makes more sense to say when it's

2

I mean, it doesn't answer the point that

3

Justice Breyer made to say, because we want to interpret

4

Title VII the way we want to interpret it.

5

is:

6

interpret it is that it makes more sense to have all of

7

the Federal remedies applied through the agency, through

8

the agency mechanism, rather than in court.

9

His point

One reason to interpret it the way you do want to

MR. GUERRA:

Justice Scalia, I apologize if

10

I wasn't clear in my response, but what I'm saying is

11

that in the Brown case this Court looked at the

12

legislative history of Title VII -- excuse me -- yes, in

13

1972 and 1977 -- and said that the reason Congress

14

adopted these, this new prohibition, was because the

15

very scheme that Justice Breyer is suggesting would have

16

been a fix for whistle blowing was ineffective.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

18

MR. GUERRA:

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That -

Then it's ineffective here.

And it is ineffective here.
And if it's ineffective

20

here and Congress has made it clear that the only way to

21

cure the ineffectiveness is with a separate provision

22

and you don't have a separate provision, you're out.

23

MR. GUERRA:

That's correct.

And the

24

ineffectiveness here is because of the extraordinarily

25

limited nature of the types of conduct that would

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When you qualified

your answer by saying that the employee can control, was

9

that a way to dismiss the collective bargaining rights?

10

MR. GUERRA:

Well, I was talking about

11

actually the -- the -- you can complain about

12

non-adverse actions under the CSRA, but all you can do

13

is ask the Office of Special Counsel to investigate.

talking about the Office of Special Counsel MR. GUERRA:

If the Office of Special

Counsel doesn't pursue the case -- and the statistics in

5

thousands and thousands of complaints, it pursued only

6

in a small handful.

7

to do anything, to go to the MSPB or to any Federal

court, if they decide not to pursue that claim.

9

that is -- and, again, both because Title VII, I submit,

You have no right as the employee

And so

10

clearly based on the remedial structure, would allow

11

employees to bring all types of retaliation claims

12

unrelated to age discrimination complaints in Federal

13

court, it doesn't make sense for Congress to have

14

relegated older workers who suffer age discrimination to

this one scheme, especially because it excludes -

Petitioner herself has no rights under the CSRA.

Mr. Guerra, can you help

2000e-16, which is the provision under Title -- 42

21

22

provision that makes the Federal Government liable for

23

retaliation based on sex and race?

24

MR. GUERRA:

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Am I correct in believing that Section

That is.
Is there another provision

that is necessary for there to be a remedy against the

Federal Government?

MR. GUERRA:

For retaliation based on race

and sex?

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Under Title VII.

6

MR. GUERRA:

That's the remedy.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No.

Then -- your argument, if

8

I understand it, is that precisely the same language

9

that's found in 2000-16e is found in 233a.

10

MR. GUERRA:

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. GUERRA:

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14
15

633a.
633a.

Yes, Justice Stevens.
And, therefore, the two

should be treated alike?
MR. GUERRA:

Precisely.

That is the -- that

16

is our -- one of our central arguments.

17

also realize -

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of course, we

In other words, that the

19

language "shall be made free from any discrimination

retaliation.

And when you use the same language based

23

MR. GUERRA:

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

Absolutely, Justice Stevens.
It's just as simple as

those two provisions being exactly 23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It isn't that simple

2

because the government hasn't conceded that, with

3

respect to Title VII, Federal employees are covered for

4

retaliation.

5

will make that concession, then the argument is very

6

strong.

If the Government -- we'll ask them -

The words are identical.

7

MR. GUERRA:

Justice Ginsburg, even if, as I

8

anticipate, they will not make that concession, the fact

9

of the matter is that the remedial structure of Title

10

VII, the Federal sector provision, confirms that the

11

substantive ban that Justice Stevens read necessarily

12

covers retaliation.

13

made a retaliation remedy available.

14

Otherwise, Congress wouldn't have

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, another reason

15

it's not that simple is that under the Age

16

Discrimination Act you have a private remedy that

17

specifically provides for retaliation.

18

noticeably absent from the Federal remedy.

19

thought that was the strongest argument on the

20

government's side.

21

MR. GUERRA:

And that is
And I

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that

22

is precisely the same -- the same is precisely true of

Title VII.

24

623(b) in our case.

25

Section 704a of Title VII is the analog to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
24
Alderson Reporting Company

I thought there was

1

a more express incorporation in Title VII of the private

2

anti-retaliation remedy, and you don't have that in this

3

case.

4
5

MR. GUERRA:
--

6
7

That is true, but our position

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that makes it not

precisely the same situation.

8

MR. GUERRA:

Not precisely the same,

9

Mr. Chief Justice, but this Court's -- in that case, for

10

example, this court said when you copy language verbatim

11

into another statute, there must be some compelling

12

evidence that you've intended to have given it a

13

different meaning.

14

If you look at the remedy section of Section

15

633a(c), all you see there is not some dramatic

16

difference, but what Congress did was it replicated the

17

civil action provisions of the private sector in the

18

Federal sector provision.

19

some stark evidence that Congress intended to have a

20

drastically different regime.

21

rather than incorporate subsection (c) of the private

22

section, 626c, it simply replicated it.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

6

The Age Discrimination and Employment Act

7

does not expressly prohibit retaliation in the Federal

8

sector context and it should not be read to impliedly

9

prohibits such conduct either.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why not, given the

11

Jackson precedent, where there was a similarly general

12

ban on discrimination and we defined discrimination to

13

include retaliation for complaining about

14

discrimination?

15

MR. GARRE:

Justice Ginsburg, the Court did

16

so very, very focused on Title IX, the Court's cases

17

interpreting the language of discrimination in Title IX

18

broadly.

19

like Title VII and the Age Discrimination Act which

20

delineate different types of discrimination.

And it specifically distinguished statutes

21

In fact, on page 175 of the Court's decision

22

in Jackson, the Court said because Congress did not list

23

any specific discriminatory practices when it wrote

24

Title IX, its failure to mention one such practice does

25

not tell us anything.

And then it pointed to the fact
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that Title VII had delineated certain types of

2

practices.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would it be -- would it be

4

unkind to say that the government's position seems to be

5

that a general ban on discrimination includes a ban on

6

retaliation except when the government is being sued?

7

In Jackson the government argued that discrimination on

8

the basis of sex included retaliation.

9

government is going to argue that the prohibition of

10

discrimination in section 1981 includes retaliation.

11

And yet here you're arguing exactly, what seems to me

12

exactly the opposite position.

13

MR. GARRE:

Tomorrow the

I think that would be unfair,

14

Justice Alito.

15

statutory context matters.

16

footnote 1 of its Jackson brief before this Court.

17

made it clear in this case.

18

The government's position is that
It made that clear in
It's

In this case, there are several indicia of

19

statutory intent that are lacking where you have a

20

general prohibition in the context of the inferred right

21

that has -- that this Court has treated differently, as

22

it did in Jackson and as it should in the did in the

23

CBOCS case that you'll hear about tomorrow.

24
25

In the Age Discrimination Act you have
separate provisions of the Act which explicitly
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

delineate different types of discrimination, including

2

retaliatory discrimination, and in the Federal sector

3

prohibition the Congress added in 1974, it added that at

4

a time where it decided to treat State employers like

5

Federal employers, specifically put the State employers

6

in the definition of employer for the Federal -- for the

7

private sector provision of the Age Discrimination Act,

8

and it created a stand-alone provision for Federal

9

employers.

10

And then it went even further.

It

11

specifically said in subsection (f) of section 633a, the

12

Federal sector provision, that the Federal sector

13

provision should be unaffected by the private sector

14

provision, the bootstrap to make clear that courts

15

should not be reading into the Federal sector provision

16

the additional protections or other provisions in the

17

private sector provisions.

18

the significance of that construction, that statutory

19

scheme in the Lehman v. Nakshian case.

20

And this Court recognized

In that case, the Court considered whether

21

Federal employees were entitled to a right to a jury

22

trial in an action for discrimination under the Federal

23

sector prohibition.

24

entitled to that.

25

made an argument very much similar to the argument made

Private sector employees were
And so the plaintiffs in that case

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

by Petitioners in this case:

2

provisions covered a jury trial right; it would make no

3

sense not to have a jury trial -

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, the private sector

But that's -- Mr. Garre,

5

that's traditionally when you're suing the government,

6

you don't get a jury.

7

And so that's on one side.

Here, as I think you would recognize,

8

retaliation claims go hand in hand with discrimination

9

claims.

A person who is discriminated against will

10

quite commonly say:

11

discrimination and then because I complained about it

12

all these bad things happened to me.

13

that those two go together.

14

I was not promoted because that was

It's very common

And yet, without any indication that

15

Congress meant to send a Federal employee off to one

16

forum to argue discrimination and another forum to argue

17

retaliation, without any hint that that's what Congress

18

had in mind, it would be rather strange.

19

MR. GARRE:

Well, let me try to answer that

20

question, Justice Ginsburg, but I just want to make one

21

final point on Lehman and the statutory construction in

22

that case.

23

its decision that because Congress demonstrated that it

24

knew how to provide a statutory right to a jury trial

25

when it wished to do so elsewhere in the very

The Court specifically said on page 162 of

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

legislation cited, but in section 633a it explicitly

2

failed to do so, and it said that that was the

3

conclusive point of statutory construction in that case.

4

So we do think the Lehman case is very on point here.

5

With respect to the general notion that it's

6

uncommon to provide -- not to provide an

7

anti-retaliation right when you do have an underlying

8

anti-discrimination prohibition, certainly we would

9

agree with you that it is uncommon, but we don't think

10

that it is absurd.

11

Congress was aware that there was a separate set of

12

protections available for Federal workers -

13

It's certainly not absurd where

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you -- I recognize

14

it's not absurd.

15

interpretation is, well, that in every other context

16

retaliation goes together with discrimination, why would

17

Congress leave out this one category of persons,

18

especially when it might have said, well, the Supreme

19

Court says discrimination includes retaliation?

20

But if there is ambiguity and one

MR. GARRE:

Well, we know that Congress in

21

the Civil Service Reform Act, as the Chief Justice

22

noted, we know that it didn't think that additional

23

anti-retaliation protections were necessary for some

24

Federal employees.

25

have a separate anti-retaliation -- anti-retaliation

So the fact that Congress wouldn't

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

right in some situation in itself is not unprecedented.

2

We do think that the statute has several

3

indicia that make clear that Congress did not intend to

4

provide an anti-retaliation right here.

5

contrast between the private sector and Federal sector

6

provisions, but look at what Congress expressed in

7

section 633a.

8

materially unlike the typical anti-retaliation right.

9

Not only the

In at least three respects this is

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can you say what the

10

government's position is on Title VII, whether there is

11

a retaliation remedy against the Federal Government?

12

MR. GARRE:

As we make clear in our brief,

13

we have not conceded that, Justice Alito.

14

think it's necessary for the courts to decide that in

15

this case -

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We don't

What is the government's

17

position?

18

passes on these complaints, what is the government's

19

position in practice with respect to a Federal employee

20

who complains, A, I was discriminated against because of

21

my race and then they retaliated against me for

22

complaining?

23

What does, for example, EEOC or whoever

MR. GARRE:

I think in practice, Your Honor,

24

we have not challenged the interpretation of the Federal

25

courts that have found that Title VII does incorporate
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2
3
4

an anti-retaliation right.

But there are at least -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Has any Federal court

found otherwise?
MR. GARRE:

I'm not aware of a circuit court

5

that has gone the other way on Title VII.

Certainly the

6

Age Discrimination Act is different.

7

in this case explicitly recognized that the textual

8

differences between Title VII and the Age Act call for a

9

different result.

The First Circuit

And there are at least two

10

differences that we do think call for a different result

11

under the Age Act.

12

The first is the fact that, whereas Title

13

VII expressly incorporates the private sector provisions

14

of the Act and by reference the anti-retaliation

15

provision of the Act -

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you agree -- then you

17

agree with Mr. Garre about the meaning of those words

18

"as applicable"?

19

MR. GARRE:

Well, this Court actually has

20

interpreted that phrase, "as applicable," in a case

21

called Chandler v. Radabush.

22

brief, but it is directly responsive to that question.

23

And the cite there is 425 U.S. 840.

24

the Court said that the "as applicable" language just

25

means that there are certain provisions of the private

It wasn't cited in the

32
Alderson Reporting Company

And in that case

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sector remedies that are inherently incompatible in the

2

Federal sector context.

3

provisions in the private sector part of Title VII that

4

allowed EEOC or the attorney general to intervene in the

5

private action and take over the suit.

6

And it pointed to the

So the "as applicable" doesn't undermine the

7

express incorporation of private sector remedies and

8

anti-retaliation.

9

between Title VII and the Age Act.

And that's a critical difference
The Age Act not only

10

does not include that express incorporation, it goes in

11

just the opposite direction, and Congress went out of

12

its way to say don't import the private sector

13

provisions -- it did that in section 633a(f) -- don't

14

incorporate those provisions, and that's what this Court

15

recognized.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do we know what Congress

17

had in mind when it said don't incorporate private

18

sector?

19

MR. GARRE:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

explanation for that section.

22

MR. GARRE:

Well, this Court in the There must be an

I don't think there is any

23

legislative history on point.

The Petitioners argue

24

that it meant don't incorporate the more restrictive

25

features.

But that argument is directly contradicted by
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this Court's decision in Lehman, where it pointed to

2

section, subsection (f) of that provision as a reason to

3

not import in the jury trial right that was not

4

recognized for private sector employees.

5

The other way -

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you agree with

7

your friend that this employee has no remedy under the

8

Civil Service Reform Act?

9

MR. GARRE:

Yes.

She is a

10

nonpreference-eligible employee of the Postal Service.

11

That means that she has to pursue her remedies under the

12

collective bargaining arrangement, which gives her a

13

remedy to complain about reprisal.

14

the union representative would present that grievance on

15

her behalf.

16

she felt that her right of -- her obligation of fair

17

representation was not carried through, she could go to

18

court and complain about that.

19

And it means that

But it also means that if for some reason

This Court in a case called Bowen v. United

20

States Postal Service recognized that employees who

21

don't get fair representation can go into court and

22

complain about that.

23

So she is protected -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What could she get -

24

what could she get by way of remedy?

25

that this employee is not covered by the Civil Service
34
Alderson Reporting Company

And you recognize

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Act, but does have collective bargaining rights.

2

Suppose there is a finding of reprisal in that forum.

3

MR. GARRE:

I believe the remedies are

4

largely co-extensive in that the principal remedy that

5

you would get under the Age Act, under the Civil Service

6

Reform Act and I believe under the collective bargaining

7

agreements, although I frankly am not certain about

8

that -

9
10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about -

MR. GARRE -- is corrective -- is corrective

11

action, Justice Ginsburg.

12

Title VII, there is no right to compensatory damages

13

under the Age Act for things like pain and suffering or

14

emotional distress; and so in that respect the Age Act

15

is quite different.

16

this under the Civil Service Reform Act and under the

17

Age Act for discrimination claims -- is back pay, front

18

pay and corrective action to -- to address the

19

discrimination.

20

There is no right -- unlike

What you typically get -- you get

The other way in which the Age Act, section

21

663a, is different than Title VII -- and this is

22

actually another thing that makes it inherently

23

incompatible with an anti-retaliation right -- is that

24

the prohibition in section 663a, the Federal sector

25

provision of the Age Act, is limited to employees who
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fit within the protected class, employees over the age

2

of 40.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why is that?

I

4

mean, if you have the private -- the private sector

5

remedy is not so limited, right?

6

MR. GARRE:

Right.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if we imply or

8

incorporate into the Federal anti-discrimination remedy

9

an anti-retaliation provision, I assume it would be in

10

the same scope as the private anti -- the private

11

anti-retaliation provision.

12

MR. GARRE:

Well, then this Court would be

13

directly disregarding the express intent in section

14

663a, where it says affecting employees or applicants of

15

employees -- for employment who are at least 40 years of

16

age.

17

And further, in section 633 JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, Mr. Garre isn't the

18

most that argument gets you that the only individuals

19

who could complain against retaliation are those over

20

40?

21

you want to go.

22

It doesn't get you out -- it doesn't get you where
It's not retaliation right at all.

MR. GARRE:

I think that's right, but if

23

we're going to talk about anomalies then we have to

24

recognize that that is an anomalous grant of retaliation

25

protection right that only protects people within the
36

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, is it any more

3

anomalous than the fact that the only protection of the

words, Congress didn't care whether there are employers

MR. GARRE:

What the courts have focused on

2

is the "any employee" language of section 623d of the

3

private sector provisions.

4

And that's the way -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But that's no reason why

5

that trumps -- any more reason why that trumps 631a than

6

631b.

7

MR. GARRE:

And that's the longstanding

8

interpretation of the EEOC and I don't think there's

9

been any doubt in the courts to date that under the

10

private sector provision you can bring claims for

11

retaliation if you're an employee, and of course that's

12

the way it is under Title VII.

13

We do think that it would be anomalous to

14

say that employees who complain about age discrimination

15

or who testify about age discrimination in a case are

16

not entitled to protection if there is an

17

anti-retaliation right, and if they are under the age of

18

40; and there is at least two other respects in which -

same explanation would apply to the public sector, if

3

you choose the word prohibition as talking about these

people who are protected by the -

It is a prohibition.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. GARRE:

their argument is that 663a contains that prohibition,

and so therefore it is limited by 631b.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Isn't this an

17

unusual retaliation case in that the person allegedly

retaliated against also has substantive

anti-discrimination claims?

21

couldn't phrase retaliation in those cases as underlying

22

discrimination.

Mr. Chief Justice.

but I think you're right.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't it quite the contrary,

3

Mr. Garre, that most -- if you did a statistical

4

analysis of all the cases in which there was a

5

retaliation claim, you doubt that you would find that a

6

very high percentage of those are cases in which the

7

person claiming retaliation is also the person who

8

claimed the underlying discrimination?

9

MR. GARRE:

I wouldn't doubt that.

I think

10

in most cases you do have discrimination claims.

11

would say, though, that our research indicated that in

12

the Age Discrimination Act context, at least the private

13

sector context, only 14 percent of the claims involve -

14

cases involve retaliation claims, which is lower than

15

other statutes.

Nevertheless, once I

In this case, isn't it the fact that the age
discrimination claim, the claim of direct

10

discrimination, was rejected and the question is but

11

nonetheless, was there a retaliation claim?

12

MR. GARRE:

She abandoned that claim at the

13

summary judgment stage.

14

Justice Ginsburg, and of course we are here today

15

because she is still pursuing her anti-retaliation

16

claim; and certainly if there is an anti-retaliation

17

right, we've agreed that you could pursue that

18

independent of whether you complained about the

19

underlying discrimination, but we do think that in at

20

least three respects the prohibition in 663a is

21

incompatible with an anti-retaliation right.

22

That's my understanding,

One, we think it is limited only to the

23

people within the protected class, people 40 years old.

24

Two, it's limited to personnel actions, which means if

25

you think about it in the context of this Court's
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

decision in the Burlington Northern case and the Oregon

2

case, it's limited to workplace-related things that

3

happened to you, and in Burlington Northern the Court

4

specifically said, in holding that Title VII's

5

anti-retaliatory provision was broader than that, was

6

that it would defeat or at least limit the purpose of

7

achieving the purpose of an anti-retaliation provision,

8

to limit it workplace-related harm.

9

And then third, of course, the

10

discrimination that's expressed in section 633 is

11

discrimination based on age, not discrimination based on

12

conduct -- the conduct of complaining about or

13

exercising your rights under Federal law.

that -

But where you've got the three indicia that you

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

incompatible with the typical anti-retaliatory

2

provision, and you couple that with other indicia of

3

statutory intent -- you have the competing schemes in

4

the statute between private sector where Congress

5

specifically delineated an anti-retaliation right, with

6

the fact that it didn't delineate that right in the

7

Federal sector scheme; the evolution of the statute -

8

where you have Congress specifically deciding not to put

9

in Federal employers with private employers, as it did

10

for States having the separate provision; and the

11

distinctions between 663a and 623 of the Act -- 623 of

12

the Act is the main private sector prohibition; 663a,

13

the Federal sector provision, doesn't have all the other

14

types of practices that are prohibited by 623.

15

For example, pensions -- pensions are

16

specifically addressed by 623.

17

that in 663a of this Act.

18

it either would address it through other means if there

19

were other protections out there.

20

Congress didn't address

It presumably understood that

Similarly we think with respect to

retaliation.

22

anti-retaliation right.

private sector provisions of the Act; and that language

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think it's plausible

2

that Congress intended to treat the issue of retaliation

3

in the Federal sector differently under the various

4

Federal anti-discrimination statutes?

5

MR. GARRE:

I do think that, Justice Alito.

6

There certainly are several differences between Title

7

VII and the Age Act, and I'm not sure that Congress has

8

explained each difference, but nevertheless they exist

9

and this Court has recognized them, most recently in the

10

Smith v. City of Jackson case, where the Court noted

11

that because of textual differences between acts, there

12

is less protection with disparate impacts of

13

discrimination under the Age Act and Title VII.

14

It's also the case that Congress has

15

provided for compensatory damages in Title VII and not

16

in the Age Act.

17

right, a Federal right to a jury trial in Federal sector

18

actions in Title VII but not in the age act.

19

Court has recognized, in Smith v. City of Jackson, that

20

Congress has treated age discrimination as if it's

21

qualitatively different and presumably accorded

22

different protections taking that into account.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Garre, can I go back

5

to the authority you're pointing out for a moment?

Is

6

it your reading of 631a, the private sector section,

7

that says "the prohibitions in this chapter shall be

8

limited to individuals who are at least 40 years of

9

age," that it's correctly read as the prohibitions in

10

this chapter, except those contained in 623a, shall be

11

limited?

12

That's the way you read it?
MR. GARRE:

Well, we -- no, Justice Stevens.

13

I think that the textual argument that the courts have

14

embraced with respect to 623d, the anti-retaliation

15

provision, is because in 623d the Congress specifically

16

said "with respect to any employees or applicants."

17

couldn't have meant with respect to only 40, only

18

employees who are over 40.

it's been interpreted consistently for decades under the

practices present different questions.

just as a matter of practice, where there is

That's right?

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. GARRE:

That's true -

The same thing in respect

to age, they can't, and what they have to do is they go

4

through the civil service system or the collective

5

bargaining agreement; is that right?

6

MR. GARRE:

Well, what would happen, if you

7

had an employee alleging discrimination on the basis of

8

age and retaliation, that would be a so-called mixed

9

complaint.

10
11

They could bring that to the JUSTICE BREYER:

No, not what they do if

their claim is a retaliation claim.

12

MR. GARRE:

If it's purely -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. GARRE:

-- a retaliation claim, they'd

have to bring it under the protections afforded by the

MR. GARRE:

that certainly Congress had any concerns about whether

MR. GARRE:

My assumption is that Congress

18

felt that the back-stop protections that were available

19

for Federal workers at the time it passed the Age

20

Discrimination Act and that were subsequently codified

21

by Congress in the Civil Service Reform Act were

appropriate for people who complained about age.

But I'm asking you, and if

you were sitting there writing it, my -- my thought -

5

the conclusion that I would reach from what you're

6

saying is you can't think of any reason why you'd treat

7

them differently.

8
9

MR. GARRE:

Well, I think the reason would

be that Congress viewed age discrimination as materially

10

different than other types of discrimination, and it -

11

either it felt that the risk of retaliation wasn't as

12

great or that the protections -- that it didn't need to

13

add protections.

14

And as I mentioned -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But why would it have

15

thought that?

16

why you say -- if you're going to put a rational gloss

17

on it, that must be what they were thinking, but why

18

would they think such a thing?

19

In other words, if -- I can understand

MR. GARRE:

Your Honor, again, Congress

20

didn't say -- I'm not -- I think you can make the same

21

argument with respect to why it gave Federal employees a

jury trial right under Title VII but not under the Age

23

Act, why it gave Federal employees compensatory damages

under Title VII but not under the Age Act.

Justice Ginsburg, on Title VII, not only has

13

the Government failed to challenge the lower -

14

consistent lower court interpretations.

15

interpretation of this provision is that it bars

16

retaliation in the Title VII sector -- Title VII bans.

17

And so when you -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

The EEOC's

Would you

19

clarify your earlier statement:

These people have no

20

remedies just for retaliation?

They do have remedies

21

for the age discrimination, but not for retaliation?

22
23
24
25

MR. GUERRA:

They have no remedies for

retaliation under JUSTICE SCALIA:

But they have remedies for

age discrimination?

MR. GUERRA:

They do, Justice Scalia, but my

point is -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. GUERRA:

Okay.

Our argument is that it makes

5

no sense to give some people remedies under one scheme

6

and leave some -- congressional employees getting full

7

remedial relief, people under the CSRA getting a limited

8

remedial relief, others getting remedies under the

9

collective bargaining rights and thousands of others

10

have no remedies only with respect -

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is that because they

12

may not engage in collective bargaining, or because they

13

have chosen not to?

14

MR. GUERRA:

15

to.

16

allowed to.

I believe they are not allowed

The entities I mentioned, I believe, are not

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. GUERRA:

19

22

Because they simply have none

of the remedies the Government has put before -

20
21

To have a remedy.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Who -- who is such a

person?
MR. GUERRA:

An employee of the

23

Transportation Security Administration.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Why can't they -- why can't

they go to like the Merit System Protection Board?

MR. GUERRA:

They don't have bargaining

MR. GUERRA:

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

So they are outside the

Civil Service, and they don't have unions?

5
6

They are excluded from the

They don't have a union?

Correct.
So they could be fired for

anything.

11

MR. GUERRA:

Well, they have claims for

12

discrimination if they suffer age discrimination

13

directly, but if they complain about age discrimination

14

and then get fired in retaliation, they have nothing.

15

And -- and just -

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose that's

17

consistent with whatever prohibition it is that

18

precludes them from engaging in collective bargaining.

19

MR. GUERRA:

But it's not consistent with

20

their rights under Title VII, Mr. Chief Justice, because

21

as the EEOC has -- an -- is entitled to deference, it

22

has said, for three decades.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you think we do

24

have to decide the Title VII question if you are to

25

prevail.

MR. GUERRA:

I do.

the issue.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You should have given us

the statute to look at if that's the case.
MR. GUERRA:

I recognize that, Justice

Scalia, and I apologize.
I would also like to note that there was a

10

suggestion that perhaps Congress didn't care as much

11

about age discrimination.

12

report that accompanied this very statute.

13

That's refuted by the House

It's quoted at page 23 of the AARP brief

14

where the Congress said age is as great an evil in our

15

society as discrimination based on race and religion.

16

Whether or not this Court agrees with that assessment as

17

an objective matter, that's the view of the Congress

18

that adopted this statute.

19

And, as Justice Stevens noted, they have -

20

they adopted the statute by incorporating the language

21

from Title VII, the exact same language where Title

22

VII's remedial scheme makes clear, and the EEOC's

23

consistent interpretation confirms, that that then

24

prohibits retaliation for complaints of race or gender

25

discrimination.
58

By incorporating that same language in the

2

ADEA's federal sector provision, Congress necessarily

3

gave it the same scope; and, by doing so, eliminated the

4

various anomalies, to put it mildly, that the

5

Government's position leads to.

6

If the Court has no further questions -
