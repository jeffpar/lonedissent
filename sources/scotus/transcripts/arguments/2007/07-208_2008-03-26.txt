We'll hear argument

Mr. Fisher.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. FISHER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The trial court was justified in requiring a

11

higher level of competency for self-representation in

12

order to prevent the trial of Ahmad Edwards from

13

descending into a farce.

14

where a defendant cannot communicate coherently with the

15

jury or the court would defeat the very autonomy

16

interests that the Court ventured to protect in Faretta.

17

Indeed, self-representation

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But why is it necessary to

18

have a special rule in order to prevent the trial from

19

descending into a farce?

20

the same rule of competency that you apply for whether

21

the defendant can be tried, and then if in fact his

22

self-representation begins to turn the trial into a

23

farce surely the court would have the power to prohibit

24

his further self-representation.

25

trial into a farce is a basis for the court's action;

Why couldn't you simply apply

Certainly, turning a

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

no?

2

MR. FISHER:

Well, I certainly hope so.

And

3

I think on the record we've got here the trial court did

4

not need to wait for that to happen.

5

begun with Mr. Edwards representing himself with the

6

jury present, and the trial had then become so unwieldy

7

and so farcical and such a mockery that he had -- his

8

right of self-representation had to be overridden, I

9

think there would have been a problem, a possible

If the trial had

10

problem of taint with the jury.

11

was justified, having seen Mr. Edwards in court --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think that the court

The problem with taint

13

would be his own fault.

14

success on appeal claiming he tainted the jury.

15

advantage of waiting is that by waiting to see if in

16

fact he will turn the trial into a farce you avoid the

17

risk of depriving him of his right to represent himself,

18

which is certainly a very important constitutional

19

right.

20

be able to pull it off or not?

21

I can't imagine that he would
And the

Why didn't you wait to see whether he's going to

MR. FISHER:

I don't think that

22

Mr. Edwards's sort of waiver by conduct in that context

23

is the only thing to consider.

24

interests in having a proceeding that proceeds smoothly

25

without episodes that render the proceedings potentially

I think that the State's

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

a mockery also are strong.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

As you understand the

3

Respondent's position -- and perhaps the question is

4

better addressed to the Respondent.

5

understand their position, would they accept

6

Justice Scalia's formulation of what the rule ought to

7

be or the formulation that his question proposed?

8
9

MR. FISHER:
that they would.

But as you

You know, it's not clear to me

It seems to me that their position is

10

much more focused on the metes and bounds of what

11

Faretta specifically recognized, which was requiring the

12

defendant to comply with the rules and if there is a

13

disorderly kind of behavior that would be sufficient.

14

But I don't read their position to be that someone who

15

is lacking in communications skills and coherent

16

communications skills even on the record in the trial

17

would be someone whose right of self-representation

18

could be overridden.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What would happen if

20

you started out with pro se representation and then the

21

trial turned into a farce?

22

would have to accept counsel at that point?

23

MR. FISHER:

Start over again, but he

Well, it seems to me that we're

24

in a world here where we don't really know what the

25

precise rules would be because of the lack of clarity
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for the trial courts.

So I don't want to tell you

2

exactly what the Indiana courts would do, but I would

3

imagine that a trial judge would be faced with a

4

decision based on how long the trial has gone on, what

5

the level of complexity of the trial is, what the level

6

of farce or taint could be for the jury.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, there must be

8

precedents.

I'm sure under the old rule, if I can

9

recall it the old rule, where you have a single standard

10

for both the right to be tried -- the -- the ability to

11

be tried and the right to represent yourself, there must

12

have been instances in which the person who was

13

representing himself was unable to cope and the trial

14

was -- was turning into a farce.

15

instances.

16

There must have been

What did they do?
MR. FISHER:

Well, I think in the cases

17

where this happened, whether it's because the trial was

18

turned into a farce or because the defendant was

19

excluded from the courtroom, as in Illinois v. Allen, I

20

think the trial often proceeds.

21
22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Proceeds, that's what I

thought.
MR. FISHER:

But I guess what I'm suggests

24

is that there is always going to be the possibility in

25

terms of a discretionary judgment call, whether it's a
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

systematic rule or whether it's something up to the

2

trial judge, that the court may decide that in interest

3

of fairness, that the -- you know -- all the -- all

4

that's gone on needs to be restarted, particularly if it

5

hasn't gone on very far.

6

in that regard.

7

I don't mean to suggest a rule

I'm suggesting --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What is your test that

8

you're going to apply ex ante?

9

coherently --

10

MR. FISHER:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. FISHER:

Whether he's able to

Oh, the test.
Yes, what's the test?

Well, the rule that we are

13

suggesting -- and again let it caution that this is not

14

a rule adopted by the Indiana Supreme Court yet -- is

15

That it is within the State's authority to override this

16

right where the defendant cannot communicate coherently

17

with the court or the jury.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Cannot communicate

19

coherently?

I sometimes -- I sometimes think that the

20

lawyers cannot communicate coherently.

21

(Laughter.)

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23
24
25

It's really a vague test,

isn't it?
MR. FISHER:

I don't think it's any worse in

terms of vagueness than what we deal with in Dusky.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Now, Dusky talks about a reasonable level of

2

understanding and a reasonable ability to assist the

3

lawyer.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let me give you a

5

concrete illustration that was brought up by the other

6

side.

7

happens to the person who has a bad speech impediment?

8

Or someone who needs -- who isn't conversant in the

9

English language?

10
11

If you have this coherent expression test, what

Are they -- automatically the right

of self representation is automatically ruled out?
MR. FISHER:

No.

I think that in

12

circumstances such as those, there is another level of

13

analysis, which is whether there's some sort of

14

accommodation that can be made that would allow the

15

representation, self-representation, to proceed by means

16

of -- whether it's an interpreter or another means of

17

communication.

18

But What we're dealing with with Ahmad

19

Edwards is someone whose thought processes so

20

decompensate and become so disorganized that it's not --

21

it's not a matter of having an interpreter to carry out

22

his instructions.

23

can actually formulate a coherent defense and

24

communicate that to the court and to the jury.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's a matter of having someone who

8
Alderson Reporting Company

So your standard of

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

coherent communication, you would not require the

2

defendant, for example, to understand the hearsay rule,

3

or other things of that sort?

4

MR. FISHER:

No.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, even if you

6

don't, I mean, how is he going to effectively

7

participate in the trial?

8

example, that he has the right and understand that he

9

has the right to cross-examine witnesses?

10

MR. FISHER:

Does he have to know, for

We're not asking to get into

11

that kind of level of detailed knowledge.

12

suggesting is that once the defendant has made the

13

choices that are forced upon him essentially by the

14

trial, i.e., the decision to represent himself and the

15

decision whether to present a defense or not, that he

16

can actually carry that out; whatever it is that he

17

wants to do within the rules of the court, that he has

18

the capability of effectuating that.

19

problem Ahmad Edwards had.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All we're

And that's the

But surely his total

21

ignorance of all of the trial rules, the hearsay rule

22

and the other details of conducting a trial, is a great

23

disadvantage.

24

long as he knows he's tossing it away.

25

instructs him:

But we allow him to toss that away so
That the judge

You're ill-advised to proceed on your
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

own; you're not a lawyer; this is, you know, a

2

complicated process; are you sure you want to represent

3

yourself?

4

you've brought it on yourself.

And if he says yes, we say, well, you know,

5

Why can't we say the same thing about his

6

supposed inability to communicate effectively, unless

7

and until he turns the trial into a farce?

8
9

MR. FISHER:
I think is the point.

Well, we can, but we need not,

And it's because there's a world

10

of difference between lack of legal knowledge and the

11

inability to relay a kind of coherent message that any

12

person, lawyer or not, of ordinary kind of mental

13

ability, capacity, would be able to formulate.

14

that there are substantial doubts about whether somebody

15

like Ahmad Edwards could convey to the jury that, in

16

fact, what he wants to present is, for example,

17

self-defense.

18

I think

What we're talking about here is that he may

19

be thinking that and that may be something that Faretta

20

entitles him to want to pursue on his own, but we're

21

concerned that he couldn't in front of a jury

22

communicate that that's what he was trying to --

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if he -- what

24

if he wants to communicate not self-defense, but that,

25

you know, Martians did it?

Is he -- and he can
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

coherently communicate that.

2

on the judge's part or the jury that he thinks Martians

3

did it?

4

There won't be any doubt

Would that qualify?
MR. FISHER:

Well, I think we're getting

5

hopefully not into an area where there would be

6

legitimate questions about underlying Dusky competency.

7

I mean, it seems to me in that circumstance you could

8

have that level of concern as well.

9

that, if someone is using a sort of insanity

And then, beyond

10

demonstration in the context of the trial, it seems to

11

me the court could fall back on not this rule, but on

12

the rule that there has to be a defense that's within

13

the bounds of the rules of the court.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I mean, I'm

15

trying to find some level that is above competency.

16

mean, there are people who believe in Martians, but

17

above competence to stand trial, but also that would

18

still be coherently communicated, but would show that

19

it's a ridiculous defense that's not going to be

20

effective in representing himself.

21

MR. FISHER:

I

Well, I do think there's a line

22

that can be drawn between a ridiculous defense that's

23

within the bounds of sort of relevance and possibility,

24

such as, you know, a very ill-advised self-defense

25

theory, and the idea that the Martians did it, which I
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think raises substantial questions as to Dusky

2

competency as well.

3

Now, I think that even looking at the

4

Court's later cases after Faretta, if we look at

5

Martinez and McKaskle, we see the same sense of

6

balancing that is what we're advocating here.

7

that McKaskle, recognizing that is a role sometimes for

8

standby counsel and that it is to be limited, is

9

something that starts down this road.

I think

And we're not

10

talking about a rule here I think that would threaten

11

the underlying decision that Faretta protects.

12

talking about a rule that is simply designed to let a

13

trial court ensure that the decisions that the defendant

14

makes are going to effectuate -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

We're

Do you think -- there is

16

always a concern in these cases whether or not we're

17

going to be creating more inefficiencies for the

18

judicial system; that is to say, the trial judge was

19

incorrect in ruling that the trial was becoming a farce.

20

I suppose you've weighed that cost against the benefits

21

of the rule.

22

that the trial is quicker, that the appeal is clearer?

23

And what are the benefits of the rule,

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think the benefits of

24

the rule, first and foremost, is that the State has and

25

the judicial system has greater certainty that there was
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a fair trial, that the adversarial process played out in

2

a way that gave the jury, you know, a meaningful

3

decision to make, and also that it conveys to the public

4

that this is a reliable system.

5

Now, you're very right.

This may introduce

6

inefficiencies, and we don't know what the Indiana

7

Supreme Court would make of that in its role as the

8

supervising court for the Indiana -- for the Indiana

9

courts.

10

But I think that what courts have an

11

impression of, including the Indiana Supreme Court, is

12

that they're not allowed to undertake that balance, that

13

Godinez and Faretta combine to preclude that option, and

14

that's what we want the Court to clear up, to say that

15

they do have that option.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you think your rule

17

would create an incentive for trial judges in close

18

cases to always deny self-representation?

19

certainly most trials proceed more efficiently and less

20

trouble for the judge if you have a lawyer there.

21

MR. FISHER:

Because

Well, I think that they're --

22

trial courts are always going to be concerned about

23

going too far and being reversed on those grounds.

24

it seems to me that the same kinds of concerns that they

25

deal with when they're making an evaluation of Dusky
13
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

competency and making, you know, evaluation of whether a

2

waiver is known and voluntary, those kinds of incentives

3

would kind of be the same here in terms of not wanting

4

to go too far.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What would the standard of

6

review be?

8

What's the

Abuse of discretion or what?

MR. FISHER:

I think so.

I think it would

be something very --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Abuse of discretion?

12

MR. FISHER: -- very much akin to what we

13

look at with Dusky.

14

determinations may be reviewed for clear error, but the

15

overall judgment is essentially an abuse of discretion,

16

a deferential kind of --

17
18

Whether there are factual

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I assume if there is

error it would be structural error --

19

MR. FISHER:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

Yes.
There would be no room for

harmless error analysis.

22

MR. FISHER:

I agree with that.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the State's objective is

24

to make sure that there is a reasonably fair trial or

25

something that resembles a fair trial, isn't that going
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to result in the denial of self-representation in a

2

great number of cases?

3

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think that -- we're not

4

suggesting a rule that is unlimited in that regard.

The

5

concern for fair trial is something that I think in a

6

lot of other Sixth Amendment contexts has some leeway,

7

but it also has limits.

8

where the Court overrode the choice of -- first choice

9

paid counsel in view of conflicts of interest and the

In the Wheat case, for example,

10

fairness questions those raised, I don't think the Court

11

has been terribly concerned that interest runs wild and

12

that it overrides that right.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

If it is the case, as a lot

14

of people believe, that it is very -- it's the rare case

15

in which a lay defendant can adequately represent

16

himself or herself, then where do you draw the line?

17

MR. FISHER:

Well, again, I think that there

18

is a qualitative, a real -- a sort of realistic line to

19

be drawn between someone who maybe has bad ideas and bad

20

judgments and someone who just cannot communicate what

21

those judgments are.

22

unable, particularly in an unstructured, stressful

23

environment, to communicate what it is that their

24

message is to the jury, to the judge --

25

In other words, someone who is

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in either case,

there's a farce.

2

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think that there --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

A very rational highly

4

competent person might want to make the trial a farce.

5

Why should that case be any different than where the

6

person does so because he's incompetent?

7

MR. FISHER:

Because I think that the -- the

8

kinds of decisions that someone would make that would

9

be -- I think even if well-communicated, would

10

demonstrating a farcical trial, would threaten the Dusky

11

competency standard.

12

questions in that regard.

13

bad notion of what it is to defend themselves and what

14

idea they're trying to present to the jury, I don't

think, if that is communicated coherently, that that

16

presents the same concerns of a farcical trial that we

17

have with Ahmad Edwards.

18

They would -- they would raise

that the Wheat case demonstrates how there can be

2

flexibility here in terms of pursuing these fairness

3

interests without overriding completely the

4

self-representation interests -- or, I'm sorry, the

5

Sixth Amendment interests of a larger set of defendants.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Fisher, are you

making essentially a "we know it when we see it"

argument?

abstract notion of what would be an abuse of discretion,

gibberish.

If this is how this man speaks and thinks,

It would be

don't really have an unwieldy standard here any more

defendant might have made.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

3

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

4

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

5
6

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

7

There are instances in the trial courts,

8

particularly with respect to mentally ill defendants,

9

where a defendant may have the degree of rational

10

understanding to satisfy the relatively low standard of

11

competence established in Dusky and reaffirmed

12

thereafter, but not have the capability of carrying out

13

the tasks that are needed to be performed in order to

14

try a case without it degenerating into a farce.

15

And I think, as Justice Scalia pointed out,

16

it would be well within the power of the trial court at

17

the time that that occurred to terminate

18

self-representation in order to further the State's

19

strong and important interest in fairness and the

20

appearance of fairness.

21

The question is whether a judge can also

22

make that decision ex ante before the trial has begun

23

and insist that the defendant be represented through

24

counsel.

25

We think the answer is that a State or the
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Federal Government would have a sufficient interest in

2

terminating self- representation or in denying a motion

3

for self-representation --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And what's your test, the

5

same test:

Inability to communicate no matter how

6

idiotic?

7

He understands that he's on trial, but his whole world

8

is just -- he not only believes in Martians, he thinks

9

we are all Martians, or something like that.

I mean this man is living in a fantasy world.

10

I mean --

11

MR. DREEBEN:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, Justice Scalia -Why pick on just the

13

ability to communicate?

14

of defects that can turn the trial into a farce.

MR. DREEBEN:

It seems to me there are a lot

We agree with that,

16

Justice Scalia.

And our view is that the Court should

17

not necessarily resolve this by adopting a specific test

18

that focuses on the ability to communicate, but should,

19

instead, look at whether the State has a sufficient

20

interest that would be served by denying self-

21

representation.

22

The defendant's lack of ability to

23

communicate can certainly serve that interest.

24

may be instances in which the defendant lacks the memory

25

to be able to remember from day to day what happened in

2

the myriad tasks of trial counsel, he would break down.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you worry at all that if

4

we adopt a separate test for the ability to represent

5

yourself, that the inevitable effect will be for the

6

test for being able to be tried to become less and less

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

After all, there's no harm

done so long as the person can't -- is not allowed to

11

represent himself.

12

I think there may be some value in linking

13

the two, so that -- so that the court knows that if he

14

finds the individual capable of being tried, he may have

15

to begin a trial with this individual representing

16

himself.

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Scalia, I think

that the tests serve different purposes.

threshold, as the Court has noted, is a minimal

threshold.

21

defendant has the minimal degree of rational

22

understanding to assist his counsel and to understand

23

what's happening.

24
25

The competency

It is designed to ferret out whether the

And he then, if he wants to waive counsel,
has to have a knowing and intelligent waiver, which
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

means he has to understand what he's doing.

2

inquiries don't focus on whether he, in fact, could

3

carry out the substantially more demanding task, both

4

mentally and as far as the ability to communicate goes,

5

of presenting a case to the jury during a trial.

6

But those

There are many examples of mentally ill

7

defendants whose world views may be substantially skewed

8

in many respects, but the competency threshold focuses

9

on whether they can understand the case in front of

10

them.

For example, if you have a defendant who is on

11

trial for making certain specific threats against

12

identified people, he may have the ability to understand

13

what the charge is and to assist counsel in whether he

14

said those things and what he intended by them, even if

15

his world view in many respects is extremely skewed; he

16

has paranoid delusions; and his ability to communicate

17

coherently on his own is very diminished.

18

And that is why the competency threshold

19

does not fully address the very important interest that

20

a State has in presenting to the world that the trial is

21

a fair one.

22

This has both the dimension of actual

23

fairness as well as perceived fairness because if the

24

public sees the spectacle of a mentally ill defendant,

25

who may well be able to cooperate with counsel and with

to communicate to the jury on his own in a very

3

delusional way, it really casts the justice system into

4

disrepute.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If it gets to be bad, the

6

court can terminate it and say, you know, you can't

7

represent yourself.

8
9

We're going to bring in counsel.

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Scalia, I think

under existing law that could not be done if the

10

Respondent's view of Faretta is adopted as an absolute

11

rule.

12
13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Sure, it could be done if

the trial is, indeed, turning into a farce.
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think it depends on

15

what you mean by "turning into a farce."

It is

16

well-established now that if the defendant actually

17

obstructs the proceeding, stands up out of order,

18

disregards the judge's procedural rulings and in --

19

violates the decorum of the courtroom,

20

self-representation can be terminated.

21

think, is an important fact that establishes that the

22

Faretta right is not an absolute right.

23

we're talking about turning it into a farce in a

24

different way.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could we have a rule that

even if you are highly competent, if you make the trial

into a farce, you forfeit your Faretta right?

4

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, you certainly could,

5

Justice Kennedy.

6

important step in the right direction.

7

And I think that that would be an

I think in cases where the judge has, as he

8

did in this case, a very firm foundation for

9

understanding that this defendant could not present a

10

coherent defense to the jury and, if allowed to

11

represent himself, would create a potential shambles --

12

not that the trial couldn't go forward in the sense

13

there would nobody courtroom decorum, but in the sense

14

that what the defendant would say to the jury would make

15

no sense.

Well, why not just change

the rule about what you can do, once the trial is under

that this person is obviously incapable of making a

20

coherent defense.

Why not wait to see?

What I object to in the proposal is making

these judgments ex ante on the basis of -- I don't know

prediction as to what the trial is going to turn into

9

MR. DREEBEN:

I think to force the State to

have the train wreck occur, when the evidence is very

10

firm and reliable that it will occur, infringes the

11

State's interests in starting the trial from the

12

beginning in a coherent and orderly way and not

13

basically subjecting the defendant to the risk of an

14

unfair trial based on the defendant's own incompetence.

And this record is about as good as you are

16

going to get on that.

17

which are in the jury -- which are in the joint appendix

18

and which Justice Ginsburg has mentioned and they are

19

reproduced in the Petitioner's brief, show that although

20

the psychiatrists ultimately concluded that he could

21

work with his lawyer, when you put him on his own and

ask him to articulate anything to the judge, which he

did in great extent, it made no sense whatsoever.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK T. STANCIL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. STANCIL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The expressed premise of the Sixth Amendment
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and of our adversarial system generally is that the

2

defense belongs to the accused and not to the State.

3

The defendant has the choice whether to exercise a

4

particular constitutional right or, as in Godinez, to

5

present no defense whatsoever.

6

self-representation based on concerns about a

7

defendant's courtroom ability violates that fundamental

8

principle.

9

surrender that control over his defense simply because

Eliminating the right of

And importantly, the accused does not

10

the State's judgment is that he'd be better served by

11

proceeding through counsel.

12

To the contrary, a lawyer may speak for his

13

client, not because he needs counsel, but only because

14

he has consented to the representation.

15

proposals that the State and the United States have

16

offered here are fundamentally inconsistent with that

17

bedrock principle of the Sixth Amendment.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the

Do you argue that

19

the State has no interest to be considered in this

20

calculus?

21

the defendant in representing himself and that the State

22

has no interest in ensuring a credible process?

23

In other words, it is solely the interest of

MR. STANCIL:

No, Your Honor.

24

expressly contemplated that in footnote 46.

25

recognized the limitations on the right of

The Court

1

self-representation, to include the rules of courtroom

2

procedure, decorum, and standby counsel.

3

perfectly adequate and indeed, when correctly enforced,

4

more than adequate to protect against the kind

5

of concern --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Those are

Well, but an

7

individual doesn't have to know and appreciate the rules

8

of courtroom procedure to be judged competent to stand

9

trial.
MR. STANCIL:

10

Correct.

But he's held to

11

them if he makes the decision to proceed.

12

the fundamental premise of this case, is that a

13

defendant who --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that's

Well, but that's

15

suggesting to me that you give no weight to the State

16

interest.

17

rules, that's basing your determination solely on his

18

interest and no weight given to the State's interest in

19

ensuring that you have a trial where people are

20

observing the rules.

21

In other words, so long as he's held to those

MR. STANCIL:

Two responses, Your Honor.

22

First, the State's interest in fairness is -- I think

23

is -- assumes the question, if you will, or begs the

24

question, what is fair.

25

trial is fair if you have the choice whether to pursue a

Under the Sixth Amendment a

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

certain right.
So in Godinez, for example, this Court

3

concluded that it was fundamentally fair for the

4

defendant to sit silent and to -- not to be held to any

5

higher competency determination for waiving his right to

6

counsel and proceeding pro se.

7

case no less.

8

doesn't appear to be fair if the defendant isn't somehow

9

held to a higher standard of competency is -- is wrong.

This was in a capital

So, I think the State's concern that it

10

The --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can I ask the

12

-- it's really the flip side of the question

13

Justice Scalia asked.

14

that if you have the same standard that trial courts are

15

going to elevate the competency showing beyond what

16

really is required?

17

Why shouldn't we be concerned

In other words, if they have to have the

18

same standard, they don't want a proceeding where you've

19

got someone who -- you know, whatever the standard is --

20

is not going to be as competent or reasonably

21

represented as he would by a lawyer, so they're more

22

likely to find the person incompetent to stand trial in

23

the first place?

24
25

These are addressed to two different,
entirely different questions.

And rather than having a

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

problem with merging the standards which results in one

2

of them being cheated, why don't we have two different

3

standards?

4
5

MR. STANCIL:

Well, I assume you're speaking

about competency to stand trial under Dusky?

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

MR. STANCIL:

Yes.

Well, first of all, the States

8

have that option.

9

concerned about the effects of this rule, that's always

10
11

been their choice.

That's clear.

So, if the States are

Certainly they're free to do so.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought your argument

12

is it's not a choice, that there is only one standard,

13

either you're competent or you're not competent?

14

is, I thought your position is competency is a unitary

15

notion and your opponent's position is, no, there are

16

shades of competency.

17

MR. STANCIL:

That

Justice Ginsburg, we're

18

speaking about the competency to stand trial.

19

think that was judge -- the Chief Justice's question.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I

When you say they have

21

their choice, you meant they have the choice of

22

elevating the standard that applies to the competency to

23

stand trial if they wish?

24

MR. STANCIL:

Correct.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Well then, why don't

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they have the choice of elevating the standard for

2

ability to represent themselves in a coherent way at

3

trial?

4

MR. STANCIL:

Because --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's what

6

understood Godinez to say, that you certainly don't have

7

to elevate your standard, but I didn't understand it to

8

say you can't.

9

MR. STANCIL:

Because the Sixth Amendment

10

says once you get to the adversarial proceeding in

11

court, the State cannot cross to the other side of the

12

courtroom and second guess the defendant's decision.

13
14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it actually

doesn't say that.
MR. STANCIL:

15

Well, with respect, Your

16

Honor, every Sixth Amendment decision that I'm aware of

17

does not let the court, in the name of second guessing

18

the defendant, whether a decision would benefit the

19

defendant come in and say:

20

not want to take the stand in your own defense, because,

21

well, look at you; you've got unsightly tattoos that

22

this jury may find offensive.

23

and say:

right.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems to me that

2

both sides are kind of raising these, taking the

3

arguments to extremes and they don't have to do that.

4

If you -- if you accept the fact that there can be a

5

higher standard than competency to stand trial, that

6

doesn't mean that the judge can say you can't make the

7

decision if you have tattoos.

And I just don't think that logic has any

To come back, if I may, to the statement in

14

Godinez, in Roman III of Godinez, it doesn't mean that

the other.

Dusky standard, and it cites Medina, which is a case

about competency to stand trial.

21

contemplates, and quite sensibly, is if somebody comes

22

in and wants to self-represent and there are indicia

23

that that's a particularly bad decision, that you may

24

want to ask more questions to determine is he Dusky

What it says is that States are free to

And he's

That was the finding that the trial judge

14

trial?

15

That's my finding.

MR. STANCIL:

Are you tell me to make that

No, Your Honor.

That finding

16

is the essence of his legal error.

Dusky competent, you have the decision-making capacity

to stand trial and in particular to exercise your other

19

rights, to plead guilty, to waive a trial by jury, to

take the stand in your own defense.

And it

seemed to me we have a excellent, really fabulous --

9

that this has happened, and Professor Hashimoto seems to

have gone and written, done research, which we have in

As I read that research, I first learned

there is a small subclass of pro se defendants who may

in fact do badly.

19

those individuals and that, therefore, a rule which

20

permitted a State to deal with this subclass of

21

disturbed people who want to represent themselves, who

22

could communicate with counsel, but can't communicate

23

with anybody else, that if we focus on that subclass and

MR. STANCIL:

Justice Kennedy, the tool is

13

right in front of the Court in Illinois versus Allen.

14

If the defendant does not obey your direction, you have

15

to warn him; and if he continues in his disruptive

16

behavior or disobeying the court, you can take away his

Sixth Amendment right.

MR. STANCIL:

Well -- but -- but the

path to -- to a resolution that doesn't offend the Sixth

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So, for example --

But Mr. Stancil, I mean,

6

you say make the record.

You said a moment ago, have

7

standby counsel who can take over.

8

the -- that the trouble with these proposals is that by

9

the time the record is made, if by that you mean

It seems to me that

10

courtroom performance, or by the time standby counsel is

11

required to take over, the damage is done.

12

And it -- it seems to me that a trial judge

13

in those situations who says, okay, I declare at this

14

point that the trial has become so farcical it cannot go

15

on like this, the trial judge at that point is -- has

16

got a damaged product in the part of the trial that has

17

already taken place.

18

is not whether he can simply tell standby counsel to

19

take over, but whether anyone can take over without

20

declaring a mistrial at that point.

21

mistrial is a cost in addition to the cost that the

22

State has been arguing for, that it should not be

23

regarded in the public eye as the sponsor of farces.

two reasons.

First, I think what trial courts probably

5

need is encouragement to enforce these rules against pro

se defendants that are -- that are at their disposal.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

Mr. Stancil.

23

Mr. Fisher, you have four minutes remaining.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Mr. Fisher, what if the

defendant here promised to sit silent during the trial

as the defendant did in Godinez?

that render everything okay?

Would that be -- would

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. FISHER

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think the defendant in

6

Godinez was pleading guilty.

I think here if you have a

7

defendant where it might create a different question if

8

there was some reliable that evidence that that might be

9

true.

But it would be hard to imagine that if a trial

10

court would have to take the defendant's word for it

11

entirely, that he would sit silent.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But, he could certainly sit

13

silent.

Having decided to represent himself, he could,

14

if he wished, just sit silent.
MR. FISHER:

15

I think it does present a

16

different situation if the defendant sits silent and

17

relies only on the reasonable doubt instruction than to

18

have a defendant who is going to present an actual

19

defense.
Here I think you have got a defendant who,

20
21

while competent at the time of trial, the day before, a

22

few days before trial wrote a letter to the court

23

saying:

24

power for training for this enormously wide defense to

25

exercise also U.S. continent five as it becomes more

Dear Judge Hawkins, I want to extend the court

Alderson Reporting Company

advanced parts differently to structure First Amendment.

2

Trial to do your best old man to isolate the young boy

3

in me at this.

4

So I think we have got a clear example of

5

someone who could communicate with counsel as the Sena

6

report indicated.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MR. FISHER:

9

Maybe he writes badly.

Well, no.

I think even in the

statements in open court you have got a lack of

10

coherence and lack of understanding.

11

there, I think, to usher through some of those

12

statements that made system somewhat comprehensible.

13

But there's, I think, every reason for the court to look

14

at these writings and to also fall back on what he had

15

seen in open court to come to the conclusion that this

16

was somebody who couldn't be relied phenomenon

17

communicate coherently.

18

And counsel was

I think relying on the Allen standard is a

19

mistake for the additional reason in addition to not

20

specifically covering this kind of scenario, it also

21

might then lead to circumstances where trial courts are

22

tightening up the Allen standard for all defendants

23

whose wish to represent themselves.

24
25

So even when you don't have concerns about
this kind of competency, the courts are going to be in a
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

position where they look at this Court's precedent and

2

say, oh, we're supposed to enforce Allen strictly and we

3

have got a rules violation, so therefore, we have to

4

override the self-representation request.

5

that that's probably not what the Court would want to do

6

just to provide that as a vehicle for dealing with

7

dependents such as Ahmad Edwards.

8
9

And I think

Now, I think it is also important to bear in
mind that -- that we can speak about fairness in trial

10

and the appearance of fairness in trial and not be

11

14

for fairness are limited by the Due Process Clause.

15

can acknowledge that there are other circumstances that

16

courts -- that trial courts in states can take into

17

account when they are dealing with Sixth Amendment

18

rights.

19

Amendment right --

And that's the point of the wheat

We don't have to think that the State's concerns

And there, of course, it was the Sixth

MR. FISHER:

I think it -- I think many in

4

fact, the court is taking care of a defendant in those

5

circumstances.

6

That, in

Now, that is counterbalanced by the Faretta

7

right.

8

systems should be in the position of taking into

9

consideration what they think appears fair in that kind

10

But I think courts -- State courts and State

of circumstance.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I take it standard

12

competency principles laid down by this Court require

13

that the defendant be present and that he testify if

14

requested.

15

defendant when competency comes up in the presence of

16

the court.

17

And the trial judge must question that

MR. FISHER:

Right.

And I think there are

18

opportunities, then, to be concerned about competency

19

based on psychiatric reports that could lead to a Dusky

20

determination in addition to determination that we're

21

seeking.
