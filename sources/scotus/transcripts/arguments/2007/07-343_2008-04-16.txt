Louisiana.

Mr. Fisher.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FISHER:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This country has not executed anyone for a

12

rape of any kind in over 43 years.

13

to reintroduce this practice into American society

14

violates the Eighth Amendment for two distinct reasons.

15

Louisiana's attempt

First, a long-standing national consensus

16

exists against it.

Indeed, Louisiana's capital rape law

17

is particularly at odds with national values because

18

Louisiana is the only State in which Petitioner, as a

19

non-recidivist, could be subject to the death penalty.

20

Second, Louisiana's law violates this

21

Court's Eighth Amendment-narrowing jurisprudence.

22

gives juries unfettered discretion to choose who, among

23

the vast class of offenders convicted of child rape, may

24

be subject to the death penalty.

25

contrast to the handful of other States that have

It

Now, this is in stark

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

capital rape laws that they've recently enacted.

2

for example, requires an offender to have served a prior

3

sentence for the same crime of 25 years before --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Texas,

Our jurisprudence just

5

requires the narrowing of the death penalty to be -- to

6

particularly heinous crimes.

7

rape is in and of itself particularly heinous, rape of a

8

child of 12 or under.

9

MR. FISHER:

And one could say that

It's no doubt a serious crime,

10

Justice Scalia, but I believe this Court's narrowing

11

jurisprudence requires narrowing beyond a particularly

12

heinous crime.

13

Georgia, this Court said that deliberate murder is not

14

on its own enough to subject an offender to the death

15

penalty.

16

Of course, in Godfrey and Gregg against

So there's two problems that arise with

17

Louisiana's statute in the context of this Court's

18

narrowing jurisprudence.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How would you describe a

20

particularly heinous rape of a child under 12?

21

would make it particularly heinous?

22

MR. FISHER:

What

Well, there could be several

23

aggravating facts that would make a rape of a child, or

24

indeed of any person, a particularly egregious crime,

25

but in Coker against Georgia, this Court did not simply
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hold that the Eighth Amendment prohibited imposing the

2

death penalty for the crime of rape; it held that this

3

Court -- that the Eighth Amendment prohibited imposing

4

the death penalty for rape with aggravating

5

circumstances.

6

Remember in Coker against Georgia, there

7

were two aggravating circumstances in that case.

8

the offender was a recidivist.

9

rape three times, was a convicted murder who had escaped

He had been convicted of

10

from prison.

11

course of committing other very serious felonies,

12

including kidnapping and robbery.

13

First,

Second, he committed the rape in the

And so, at the very minimum, the State

14

stands here with the burden today to say that an average

15

child rape is worse than the crime in Coker, that this

16

Court held was not sufficiently superior --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Suppose -- suppose the

18

State says that all recidivist rapists of children under

19

12 will suffer the death penalty.

20

narrow that class further?

21

narrowing depends upon how narrow the class is described

22

in the first place.

I mean, the need for

Right?

23

MR. FISHER:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Does it have to

If -I mean, if the law says you

have to be a recidivist, you have to have all the other
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

factors that you just mentioned, if the law said that,

2

would you come in and say, "Oh, no, you can't just give

3

everybody who commits that crime the death penalty"?

4

You have to narrow the class.

5

MR. FISHER:

Well, no question that would be

6

a much stronger argument under this Court's narrowing

7

jurisprudence.

8

problems with that kind of a statute:

9

still potentially be left with the problem that this

Now, you'd still be left with two
First, you'd

10

Court addressed in Furman and all the subsequent cases

11

of having a large class of offenders of which only a few

12

get the death penalty.

13

reason to differentiate.

14

Now, there needs to be some

The State might well say -- especially the

15

State of Texas and other States that have these very

16

severe recidivist requirements might say that is good

17

enough, but they'd still be left with the -- with the

18

argument that they would have to make that a person who

19

convicts -- who commits child rape and does not -- it

20

does not result any death, is a worse offender than

21

somebody who deliberately kills somebody --

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23

MR. FISHER: -- on average.

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

All right.

What if --

What if, instead, the State

simply defined the class as the class of those who
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

commit rape, and then listed as an aggravating

2

circumstance the rape of a child under 12 years old?

3

That would be perfectly consistent with the narrowing

4

jurisprudence, wouldn't it?

5

MR. FISHER:

I'm not sure it would,

6

Justice Souter.

7

you can't simply start with rape and then add an

8

aggravating circumstance, in terms of this Court's

9

Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.

10

Remember Coker tells us, I think, that

But even if you're

asking, just in terms --

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you go over that,

12

Mr. Fisher?

13

opinion, right, in Coker?

14

separately, and I thought he left open an outrageous

15

rape resulting in serious, lasting harm to the victim.

16

Because the -- there was a plurality
And Justice Powell wrote

He said that the Coker jury was not asked

17

and could not have found from the facts in that case

18

that the offense was outrageous or want only violent in

19

that it involved a aggravated battery.

20

have an opinion of five Justices saying that, in any and

21

all circumstances, rape that leaves the victim alive

22

cannot be punished by the death penalty.

23

MR. FISHER:

So you don't

Let me first say that the State

24

hasn't alleged those things that Justice Powell

25

identified.

So, even if Justice Powell's opinion
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

controlled, I think we would prevail here.

2

--

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But remember

I'm questioning -- you're

4

saying it's off the chart because the Court held that

5

you cannot have a death penalty for rape.

6

suggested that that's not so clear.

7

MR. FISHER:

And I

Well, my understanding of this

8

Court's Marks rule is that the narrowest opinion that

9

commands a majority --

so Justice Powell's opinion was

10

actually a seventh vote.

If you count the two Justices

11

on this Court who held the death penalty was

12

unconstitutional across the board and add the four that

13

constituted the plurality in Coker, we think the

14

plurality opinion becomes --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. FISHER:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

That's a --

-- the controlling one.
That's strange way of

making a majority, isn't it?

19

(Laughter.)

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Two people who think even

21

the death penalty for murder is no good, they're going

22

to form the majority of people who consider whether a

23

lawful death penalty can be imposed for rape.

24

at least in those circumstances, you have to discount

25

the people who would not allow the death penalty under
8
Alderson Reporting Company

I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

any circumstances for any crime.

2

MR. FISHER:

Well, I'm not aware of any

3

wrinkle in this Court's jurisprudence that says that if

4

a Justice is too far out of the mainstream that their

5

vote is discounted.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. FISHER:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

He --

But I want to try to -He -- he is not considering

the issue that is before the Court.

The issue before

10

the Court is whether -- whether a permissible death

11

penalty can be imposed for this crime.

12

say there's no such thing as a permissible death

13

penalty.

14

there, we should iron it in pretty quickly.

I mean, it would be -- if that wrinkle isn't

15

(Laughter.)

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

MR. FISHER:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

on the plurality opinion.

20

wanted to make.

At any rate --

Fair enough.
There were four justices

That was the only point I

21

MR. FISHER:

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23

These parties

Okay.

Thank you.

But --

Even -- even with respect

to -- now, I'm asking you to --

24

MR. FISHER:

Right.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- to forget my question
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

again for a minute.

2

MR. FISHER:

Okay.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But --

Even on the plurality

4

analysis, your argument, as I understand it is, if there

5

is any question left in Coker, in effect it's answered

6

by Enmund/Tison.

7

MR. FISHER:

I think that's right, and it's

8

also answered by simply the empirics across the country

9

right now, if you did nothing more than applied the

10

Roper and Atkins cases.

11
12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, but then that's a

different reason.

13

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, speaking of

15

Roper and Atkins, is it -- is it only work in one way?

16

How are you ever supposed to get consensus moving in the

17

opposite direction?

18

number of States under Roper and Atkins who impose it,

19

and you say, well, most of them are abolishing it, so we

20

think it's unconstitutional, combined with other

21

factors.

22

In other words, you look to the

Now, if there's going to be a trend the

23

other way, how does that happen?

As soon as the first

24

State says, well, we're going to impose the death

25

penalty for child rape, you say, well, there isn't a
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

consensus, so it's unconstitutional.

2

have to get together and do it at the same time?

3

are they supposed to move the inquiry under Atkins and

4

Roper in the opposite direction?

5

MR. FISHER:

And do 20 States
Or how

Well, I think it's possible,

6

but this Court has understood -- I think well understood

7

that it is a practical problem.

8

this Court caution before ruling a law unconstitutional.

9

Here, I don't think --

It is one that gives

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MR. FISHER: -- you're going to need to

12
13

That's nice.

gravel -JUSTICE SCALIA:

I say that's nice.

We're

14

in effect -- in effect prohibiting the people from

15

changing their mind.

16

MR. FISHER:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18
19

I don't --- about what justify's the

death penalty.
MR. FISHER:

I don't think that's

20

necessarily the case, Justice Scalia.

21

there are narrower ways to decide this case that could

22

leave open the possibility of future developments.

23

And, of course,

But, Mr. Chief Justice, I want to answer

24

your question and say I think there may be a

25

misunderstanding that this Court really needs to address
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that in this case, because we have had, since 1995 when

2

the State of Louisiana passed this law and the year

3

after when the supreme court of Louisiana upheld it in a

4

very widely covered opinion from which this Court denied

5

certiorari, there has been a national debate for 12 or

6

13 years already as to the propriety of imposing

7

the death --

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the trend since

1995, '90, has been more and more States are passing

10

statutes imposing the death penalty in situations that

11

do not result in death.

12

MR. FISHER:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

Didn't we say in Atkins

that it's the trend that counts; it's not the number?

16
17

You have

to ask yourself the question whether that is enough.

14
15

I think that's right.

MR. FISHER:

I think this Court said in

Atkins -JUSTICE SCALIA:

The trend -- the trendy

19

expression hoist by your own petard:

20

clearly in the direction of permitting more and more --

21

of more and more States permitting the capital

22

punishment for this crime.

23

MR. FISHER:

The trend here is

Clearly, I think that Atkins

24

and Roper look at trend among other things.

25

it is important to remember that there were 20 States in
12
Alderson Reporting Company

And I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

each of those cases that allowed the death penalty under

2

those circumstances, but I think we have to ask

3

ourselves whether the movement that's occurred over the

4

past dozen years is enough to matter.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, let me ask --

6

we will put that to one side, but how much movement you

7

need.

8
9

I'm more interested in the analytic
question:

How does it happen?

I mean because your

10

position would be every one -- a case in every one of

11

those States, whatever the number is, is

12

unconstitutional because we've said the trend is the

13

other way.

14

Well, how does a trend ever get started in

15

the opposite direction?

16

MR. FISHER:

Well, as it happened here,

17

States can pass laws, and they can bring prosecutions

18

potentially reaching --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you want to say

20

this is -- you want to say this is unconstitutional

21

because most States do it the other way.

22

if a similar case arose in Texas involving capital

23

punishment in a nondeath case, you would say well, most

24

go the other way.

25

down one by one, it is kind of hard to get a trend

And I assume

In other words, if you knock them

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

going.

2

MR. FISHER:

Well, a State could do

3

something like what Georgia has done, which is pass a

4

law that says that the death penalty is permissible in a

5

given crime -- in, for example, rape -- to the extent

6

allowed by the United States Supreme Court, which is the

7

extent allowed by the Eighth Amendment.

8
9

If several States pass laws like that,
eventually this Court even -- let's say the Court

10

decides this case in my favor today.

11

Court could take notice of that and take certiorari and

12

again decide whether or not the Eighth Amendment was --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Eventually this

They don't even have to say

14

"the extent allowed by the United States Supreme Court."

15

They can pass a law that seems to contradict a prior

16

opinion of ours; can't they?

17

MR. FISHER:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

Abraham Lincoln should they

could, anyway.
MR. FISHER:

20
21

Of course.

There's no double about that,

and it happens frequently.

22

Now I want to ask about --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If somebody in this

23

case is tried and convicted under that law, you would

24

say:

25

a sufficient trend in favor of that.

Well, that's unconstitutional because there is not

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And it just seems to me that that

2

understanding of Atkins and Roper prevents the

3

development of the law except in one direction.

4

MR. FISHER:

As I said, it may be

5

practically difficult, but it's not impossible, because

6

this Court could eventually take notice of what it was

7

seeing.

8
9

Now, I think it is important to ask -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's a brief in this

case on behalf of several States, and the argument

10

that's made in that brief on the point that the Chief

11

Justice has raised is we can never know whether there is

12

a consensus one way or another so long as Coker seems to

13

cover the waterfront, so long as Coker admits of the

14

interpretation that you cannot have the death penalty

15

for rape, period.

16

So the argument is on this question -- not

17

talking about the universe of crimes, but as to rape --

18

we cannot know if there is a consensus one way or

19

another until this Court clarifies what Coker stands

20

for.

21

MR. FISHER:

Justice Ginsburg, I think there

22

are two problems with that.

First, it is a theoretical

23

argument that doesn't have any factual underpinning.

24

There is no evidence in any State legislature that Coker

25

has stood in the way of enacting statutes like this.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And, again, I want to emphasize to this

2

Court to remember, if there were any overhang or

3

distorting effect of Coker, it certainly would have gone

4

away by 1996 when the Louisiana supreme court laid out a

5

very detailed opinion explaining why a law like this

6

could be constitutional and, in effect, exhorting other

7

States to pass laws like it.

8
9

And so for a dozen years in death-penalty
jurisdictions there has been a very vigorous effort by

10

proponents of these laws to get statutes like this

11

passed.

12

Justice, I want to bring myself back to your trend

13

question.

14

number of States allowing the death penalty here as

15

allowed it in Coker in 1977.

16

And look what we end up with.

Mr. Chief

What we end up with is exactly the same

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I know, but, as I

17

pointed out, it is very expensive to run a regime in

18

which you have the death penalty.

19

legislators in those States saying, well, we've got

20

Coker on the books.

21

would we want to be the second State and go through this

22

process and then have the Supreme Court throw it out?

23

You know, everyone is waiting for the next State.

And I can see the

We've only got one State.

Why

24

I mean it's a very difficult process, it

25

seems to me, to run the evolution of the law in both
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

directions.

2

whatever -- I don't know what the number is, 15, or 20,

3

or 30 States -- it just can't materialize when you have

4

Coker there and you have Atkins looking only in one

5

direction.

6

And then if you're insisting on a trend of

MR. FISHER:

There are, no doubt, various

7

legislative considerations.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

I just would -Do you really think that if

this Court held in the present case that the death

10

penalty can be imposed for the rape of a child under 12,

11

do you really think that the trend would not continue,

12

that there would not be more States to enact such a

13

penalty?

14

MR. FISHER:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. FISHER:

17

Oh, absolutely, Justice Scalia.

No.

That there would be more?
Absolutely, I think that

it would not continue.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. FISHER:

That it would not.

If -- and I think it is

20

important to understand not just the Louisiana supreme

21

court; but in 2004, when Patrick Kennedy was put on

22

death row in Louisiana, in light of this Court's Atkins

23

and Roper jurisprudence, notice was served in all

24

death-penalty jurisdictions that if you want a law like

25

this, you've got a few years to pass it before this case
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

gets to the Supreme Court.
I think that's why you have seen an uptick

3

of two or there other States passing laws in the last

4

couple of years.

5

recreate the situation this Court faced in 1977 in

6

Coker, where six States would have allowed the death

7

penalty for child rape.

8
9

But, again, all that has done is

And in Roper this Court emphasized that it
would be very ironic to find a trend or a lack of

10

movement dispositive if the reason for that action more

11

recently is because long ago society recognized that

12

this was an improper punishment and this Court --

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think that all these

14

other States, if told that it is permissible to have the

15

death penalty for child rape at least under some

16

circumstances, would come to the conclusion that the

17

worst case of child rape that can be envisioned is still

18

less heinous than any murder that qualifies for the

19

death penalty?

20

MR. FISHER:

I think they may well,

21

Justice Alito.

22

well, in Roper this Court said -- I think it addressed a

23

similar question.

24

terms of the Eighth Amendment.

25

It's important to recognize not just --

There has to be a line somewhere in

Now, we can imagine a terribly serious case
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

with a juvenile offender who is 17 years old, for

2

example, but drawing a line in a place that makes sense

3

almost all of the time is the best we can do.

4

State were to come up and make the argument today that:

5

Imagine the most heinous child rape you can, first of

6

all, it wouldn't say that under the narrowing problem

7

because of Maynard against Cartwright.

8
9

If a

But, more importantly, other States would
beg to differ.

Look at Utah.

Utah thinks the next most

10

serious crime after murder is assault, an aggravated

11

assault on a prison guard.

12

most serious crime after murder is aggravated

13

kidnapping.

South Dakota thinks the next

14

Once you roll the line back from the line

15

established in Coker, which is requiring the death of

16

the victim, it becomes extraordinarily difficult to

17

figure out where the line is going to be drawn for

18

Eighth Amendment purposes.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

rape has evolved even since, the period since Coker.

even since -- as I say, even since Coker.

Coker may have thought rape of an adult wasn't serious

enough to warrant the death penalty when the legislature

had made a contrary determination, perhaps that would be

addressed differently if -- differently today; and

certainly rape of a child would be understood not to be

understood that rape was an extraordinarily serious

crime.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

There was, at least in

16

the amici briefs in Coker -- may not have been explicit

17

in the Court's decision -- but the argument was made

18

that the rape law in question, the Georgia law, came

19

from an earlier tradition when a woman was regarded as

20

as good as dead once she was raped; and the crime was

21

thought to be an offense against her husband or her

22

father as much as it was to her.

background of Coker, plus the racial element in it was

24

very strong.

And that was the

I imagine that that -- if the question were

still be factors.

because it said once you've been raped, you're spoiled.

That's not -- there's no parallel with child
rape.
So I think that what was going on under the

surface in Coker is quite different.

9

MR. FISHER:

Justice Ginsburg, I think,

10

although not with the same historical pedigree, the same

11

argument is being put forward by the State today, that

12

by definition, for a child to have been raped is

13

tantamount to having been killed, and the social workers

14

and sex assault experts here today I think are telling

15

you with this one voice, we very much want to

avoid sending --

the notion that she's somebody else's property; and --

MR. FISHER:

I think that's fair enough,

21

Justice Ginsburg, but I think also I'd like -- perhaps

22

Justice Alito was right, that looking at the Court's

23

opinion gives us the best indication of the analysis;

24

and I think the parts that you were reading are from the

25

earlier part of the opinion where the Court was saying
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that rape in general is not as serious as murder, but

2

the end of the plurality win in Coker is very emphatic.

3

It says, that doesn't end the question, because we have

4

two very serious aggravating circumstances and this is a

5

particularly serious incident of rape.

6

Even then, the Court's words were, that does

7

not change the fact that the victim is not killed.

that is --

it to the jury whether to impose the death penalty or

to capital murder.

18

And if you commit one

Isn't that a proper way of reading the

19

Louisiana murder statute from which you took your

20

example?

21

with the theory that you're arguing here that you can

22

simply define child rape as capital and let it go at

23

that?

24
25

And if it is, isn't that example inconsistent

MS. CLARK:

No, Your Honor.

I think if I --

if I understand what you're asking, with regard to

murder again, murder traditionally is a very broad

2

crime.

3

murder to account for many ways in which it could be

4

committed.

5

So, I think what Louisiana did is they defined

They labeled one class of them as being -JUSTICE SOUTER:

I quite agree with that.

6

My point was just this:

7

understood it a moment ago -- that the Louisiana child

8

rape statute is not unique; that, in fact, Louisiana

9

defines other crimes very narrowly, so that you were

10

You made the argument -- as I

making a different kind of argument.

11

You were saying we in Louisiana define

12

murder of a law enforcement officer very narrowly.

13

requirement to add any narrowing or aggravating

14

circumstance there, and the statute passed muster.

15

my point simply is, I don't think that's the way to read

16

the Louisiana statute.

No

And

17

The Louisiana statute instead says killing

18

with intent et cetera is -- is capital murder if there

19

is a further circumstance added to it; and five are

20

given.

21

So all I'm saying is I don't think the fact

22

that your capital murder passed muster under Lowenfield

23

is authority for saying that the child rape statute

24

passes muster here.

25

MS. CLARK:

Well, I agree with you on that,

Do you?

Didn't the -- didn't the

Louisiana statute that -- that was at issue in

Lowenfield produce the result that if you committed

11

intentional murder of a law enforcement officer, it was

12

up to the jury whether to give you the death penalty or

13

not?

14

MS. CLARK:

Yes, correct, Your Honor.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would not the same result

16

be -- be achieved by a statute that said if you

17

intentionally kill a law enforcement officer, you are

18

subject to the death penalty?

19

the same degree of narrowing?
MS. CLARK:

20
21

Wouldn't it be precisely

That's correct.

Yes, Your

Honor.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And isn't -- isn't the

23

difference -- isn't the difference just what

24

Justice Scalia brought up in an earlier question to

25

Mr. Fisher?

He said what seems to count, the way we
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have targeted our jurisprudence, turns on how you define

2

the class that is narrowed.

3

And my suggestion to you was that the class

4

that is narrowed under your homicide statute is a class

5

that consist of all killing with specific intent to kill

6

et cetera, which is then narrowed by five different

7

circumstances set out.

8

Here, the class is defined as child murder,

9

and there is nothing in the aggravating circumstances,

10

the possible aggravating circumstances that narrows it

11

any more; and isn't that distinction correct?

12

MS. CLARK:

I think, if I can address this

13

perhaps without a specific yes or no, what I'm saying is

14

the homicide statute draws specifically a large class

15

and specifically narrows it.

16

narrowly defines the target group without making

17

reference to the broader class.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The rape statute in itself

I think is -In one respect is

19

broader, and perhaps whether it assists your position,

20

Coker is a crime that could have only a female victim

21

and a male perpetrator, but this child rape statute as I

22

understand it could be the -- the victim could, male or

23

female; the perpetrator could be male or female.

24
25

MS. CLARK:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And

actually, in Caddo Parish, the man who was convicted and
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sentenced to death there had a -- had a female cohort,

2

so to speak who was involved in the rape with him, who I

3

believe has not been tried yet; but she participated in

4

the rape with him, and therefore as a principal who with

5

specific intent is alleged to have committed the offense

6

as well.

7

So both male and female could be convicted

8

of this offense, if he commits this offense, and both

9

male and female children could be victims of this

10

offense; that's correct, Your Honor.

11

I think that --

16

refer to international commentary on issues like this,

17

but the English law lords have filed an amicus brief

18

discussing the international principle that nations that

19

retain the death penalty may not extend the death

20

penalty to crimes to which it does not presently apply.

21

I know it is not popular to refer to

They suggest that as a matter of

22

international law, there's sort of a correspondence to

23

our evolving standards of decency that have generally

24

governed our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.

of a one-way rachet, we look at trends in one direction

It's kind

but we don't look to see if you suddenly have changed

2

gears and go in the other direction.

3

Could you just comment on that argument?

4

MS. CLARK:

Well, first of all, I certainly

5

recognize that there are approximately 28 international

6

countries that would permit the death penalty for rape.

7

However, this Court in its jurisprudence has never, ever

8

based its determination solely upon that factor.

9

certain instances, the Court has looked to that to

In

10

confirm its own decision in the matter, but it's never

11

been controlling.

12

I would point out, though, Your Honor, if I

13

may, that -- that there are no -- there are no treaties

14

that are controlling upon the United States or this

15

Court that would --

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm not asking that.

I

17

just used that as an analogy to our evolving standards

18

of decency cases which has been part of our Eighth

19

Amendment jurisprudence, that sort of is a -- one way

20

direction in which these cases go.

21

appropriate -- are you aware of any case saying we can

22

turn around and go in another direction?

23

MS. CLARK:

Do you think it's

I think we can, especially

24

where, as here, that turn-around, that determination is

25

based upon a unique understanding of how this crime

Alderson Reporting Company

seriously, gravely affects children in a manner --

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do we know more about the

3

crime now than we did 40 years ago?

4

MS. CLARK:

Well, I think that we do.

I

5

think that that is solely reflected in the child

6

pornography laws that have come about since then.

7

Osborne versus Ohio, the Court said, after Coker, you

8

can't even possess child pornography in the privacy of

9

your own home.

In

So I think that -- because it is so harmful.

10
11

And I think that that along with Megan's Law, I think

12

that those sort of cases are also recognition of the

13

fact that we now know more about this crime.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can you -- can you give me

15

one second on my own error here, but I just traced the

16

statute through.

17

It says, "aggravated rape is a rape committed upon, et

18

cetera," and then it says "where the victim is under the

19

age of 13."

20

I assumed it picked up the definition of rape from

21

section 41.

22

or vaginal sexual intercourse, and then in section three

23

it defines oral.

24
25

What I did was I looked at section 42.

Right.

So it doesn't say what rape is.

So

And section 41 defines rape as anal or oral

statutory thing, or is there some other statute?

that is the right statutory thing, because it seems to

cover, particularly in its definition of oral

of which I agree is quite bad, but it's still a very,

11

very wide range.

MS. CLARK:

You know what

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe in

Enmund what the Court was looking at was, when the Court

addressed the issue it didn't simply say a human life

9

wasn't taken.

It went on to look at is robbery itself,

10

the underlying offense, a crime serious enough to

11

warrant the death penalty?

12

trying to address what are the limits, I believe of the

13

felony murder doctrine as applied to homicide when the

defendant himself -- what -- what participation in the

15

offense did he have to reach that level in which he

16

would suffer the death penalty.

different from a case like this where the offender

absolutely committed the offense, where the offender

premeditation or deliberation, and directly causes that

terrible harm himself.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ,

2

FOR TEXAS, ET AL., AS AMICI CURIAE,

3

IN SUPPORT OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MR. CRUZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

Few evolving standards of decency are more

7

pronounced that the growing understanding in modern

8

society of the unique and irreparable harm caused by

9

violent child rape.

From Jessica's Laws to Megan's Laws

10

to the laws at issue here, elected legislatures have

11

repeatedly acted to deter and to punish violent child

12

rape.

13

In particular, the legislatures of seven

14

States have determined that the very worst child rapists

15

should be eligible for the most serious punishment.

16

I'd like to begin by talking about the

17

effect of Coker.

And Justice Kennedy, you raised in

18

particular the dual aspects of Coker.

19

the effect of Coker is, is that it has been under a

20

cloud of confusion.

21

of Coker in my judgment, it's clear Coker does not reach

22

this instance.

23

explicitly specify that it was adult rape, and indeed

24

the question presented in the briefing in Coker not use

25

the word adult rape at all.

What we suggest

A fair reading, a careful reading

The Court bent over backwards to

It was phrased generally in

46
Alderson Reporting Company

terms of rape, and the Court repeatedly and I would

2

suggest not accidently added the word adult.

3

But that being said, the States have

4

operated since Coker under a great deal of confusion as

to what exactly Coker meant.

7

And there's a great deal of confusion.

As

15

Petitioner argues quite passionately, those that are

opposed to the death penalty for child rape argue

17

vociferously that Coker does not allow it, as Petitioner

18

has done in many, many pages of briefing.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

You started out by saying

20

it's the worst cases of child abuse, and that's -- child

21

rape -- and that's why I was interested in the

22

definition.

23

covers all instances of some kind of physical

24

intercourse with a child, including oral, vaginal, anal.

25

I can't imagine one that wouldn't be covered if the

It seems to me this definition simply

Alderson Reporting Company

2

Now, am I right in thinking it's not the

3

worst instances; it's every instance of rape defined

4

that way?

5

MR. CRUZ:

You're not exactly right, Justice

Breyer.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. CRUZ:

9

Thank you.

The statute that is being

challenged in this case was the pre-amended statute.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. CRUZ:

12

wasn't 13; it was 12.

13

Patrick Kennedy was convicted was only vaginal or anal

14

rape.

So oral was not in it.

So the amendment --

It was not all child rape.

It was not all child rape.

It was only children up to the age of 11.
MR. CRUZ:

That's exactly rate.

20

was a substantial narrowing.

21

it was only vaginal and --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. CRUZ:

And so that

It was 11 and younger, and

Thank you.

And anal.

I see.

Beyond that, however,

the juries that have considered this so far -- and it

25

has been a limited circumstance because of the
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

distorting effect of Coker -- but the juries that have

2

considered this so far and the prosecutors that have

3

prosecuted have shown every ability to distinguish truly

4

egregious rapes.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But there was some

6

indication that in most cases the prosecutors, in part

7

to see if they can get a plea bargain, begin by saying

8

they're going to charge with the death penalty.

9

like you to comment on prosecutorial discretion.

And I'd
Again,

10

it cuts to weight.

In one sense, it's -- it's a check,

11

so that only the most egregious cases are covered.

12

On the other hand, there's a temptation to overreach,

13

and it's an argument that Petitioners make for saying

14

that the death penalty should not apply.
MR. CRUZ:

15

Justice Kennedy, Petitioners

16

assert that that is the case, that a plea bargain has

17

been offered in every instance.

source of that assertion, but at least with respect to

19

the State of Texas, we don't have information one way or

20

the other in terms of the conduct of Louisiana

22

I'm not sure of the

What we can say is that the cases that have

23

been prosecuted -- the two individuals currently on

24

25

crimes that are just unspeakable.

And in both of them,

Justice Stevens asked, you know, has any nation

internationally gone backwards?

It's interesting if you

10

look at the history in England.

England actually has

11

gone back in force.

rape under Saxon law was punishable by death, and then

13

there was a period 1285 where the punishment was relaxed

14

to loss of the eyes and testicles.

MR. CRUZ:

I'm not aware of a decision doing

But what about the comment

on the international community's view that it is really

MR.CRUZ:

You know, the Law Lords' brief --

12

I have to admit personally I found really quite

13

astonishing, and I was harkened back to some of the

14

issues this Court considered in the Medeillin case

15

because the Law Lords' brief argued that the United

16

States -- that this Court has no ability to determine

17

that any other crime is subject to the death penalty.

18

And there were two bases:

19

United States has never ratified.

20

inchoate international law understanding that, because

21

other nations have made a policy determination about the

22

death penalty, that it is forbidden to the U.S.

Congress, it is forbidden to the States of the United

acknowledge there is a crime that is consistent with our

That brief, to my mind, embodied all of the

dangers of the very broad arguments that we're being

presented in Medeillin, that ultimately the

6

what is permissible and what is lawful.

brief didn't say this is guidance.

definition of the first statute with the -- what we call

possible narrowing factors that occur to me.

20

submit the statute is sufficiently narrow as drafted,

21

but beyond that, the one that has been -- the four

22

States that have most recently acted have used

23

recidivism as a narrowing factor.

Correct.

There are two other

narrowing -- narrowing aggravators that could be

applied.

6

The aggravated rape that Justice Powell discussed in his

Coker opinion, a really brutal case, which both Florida

Kennedy could not be convicted in any other State.

One would be especially heinous or vile rapes.

In

Florida and Georgia, if they concluded that his violent

rape requiring surgery to correct was especially violent

12

and heinous, he could be convicted in either of those

13

States.

an aggravator for multiple victims.

of these child rapists rape more than one child.

that is another potential aggravator that a State could

choose.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FISHER:

I would like to address first

23

the narrowing component of this case and then turn to

24

the idea of trends on the first question presented.

25

First, the reasons for this Court's
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

narrowing jurisprudence is to avoid a situation in which

2

a few, only a few offenders out of a vast pool are given

3

the death penalty, and there's no legal principled

4

explanation to describe why those offenders get the

5

death penalty.

6

Ms. Clark says that Louisiana's law is

7

narrow.

Well, if you just look at empiric, as best as

8

we've been able to gather statistics and Texas has some

9

similar statistics in its brief, we're talking about

10

under Louisiana's definition of child rape about five

11

times as many individuals per year as are convicted of

12

deliberate murder.

13

you end up with is only one every several years getting

14

the death penalty.

15

and capriciousness.

16

This is enormous class.

And what

That is the definition of arbitrary

Justice Breyer, Mr. Cruz is right, Louisiana

17

Supreme Court at 58(a) addressed -- addressed -- as

18

existed at trial, it included or rape.

19

exactly under ex post facto which is the operative one

20

or not, but it doesn't matter because even the anal or

21

vaginal component statute still gets you five times as

22

many -- than just absolutely being struck by lightning.

23

Even in Louisiana simply consensual sex between an

24

18-year-old and a 12-year-old is a capital offense.

25

I'm not sure

And so we don't think Louisiana's law
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sufficiently narrows.

2
3

Mr. Cruz says --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is that in front of us

here?

4

MR. FISHER:

It is with respect to

5

narrowing, because Mr. Cruz -- the only answer to that,

6

I think is what Mr. Cruz --

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This is not a speech case

8

where you have standing to object to the statute that

9

can -- would be unconstitutional as applied to others --

10

MR. FISHER:

We absolutely do --

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MR. FISHER:

Or is -- contradicts.

There's square precedent,

13

unanimous holding of this Court in Maynard against

14

Cartwright so that you can't justify a statute that

15

fails to narrow on as applied grounds.

16

constitutional infirmity is the fact that it gives

17

unfettered discretion to prosecutors and juries to

18

choose who to give the death sentence to.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The

I don't understand the

20

difference.

If you have a general murder law with an

21

aggravating factor of killing of a law officer, okay,

22

the jury can decide from the whole category of killings

23

of law officers who gets the death penalty and who

24

doesn't.

25

when you have a statute that makes it a capital offense

Why is that any different from what happens

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to kill a law officer, without any further

2

qualification?

3

It's exactly the same result.

It goes to

4

the jury.

5

to you whether you give him the death penalty or not.

6

This person killed a law officer.

MR. FISHER:

It is up

At the end of the day the jury

7

has discretion.

But the difference between that case

8

and this case is that you have a much smaller pool of

9

offenders and a much higher likelihood the jury is going

10

to return death.

11

literally persons one out of every several years getting

12

the death penalty.

13
14
15

Here you have have a vast pool and

If I could say a thing -- two things about
the trend argument that the states have putting forward?
First, remember there's no trend whatsoever

16

with respect to non-recidivists.

17

have passed laws in child rape context for capital --

18

making it a capital crime and even in the Meagan law and

19

others is all about recidivism.

20
21
22

The other states that

Louisiana is not part of that trend.
Louisiana stands alone.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought -- the

23

bulk of your argument, though, it seems to me, would

24

not -- would be the same in a recidivist case, because,

25

of course, that doesn't result in death either.
58

1

MR. FISHER:

I think --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, I don't --

3

it is sort of a factual distinction but I don't see how

4

it helps your argument.

5

MR. FISHER:

Well, it would give you a

6

narrower way to do this case.

7

the analysis -- Roper actions Louisiana stands alone in

8

terms of what is national consensus.

9

You could say that under

In Enmund this Court said that it is not

10

enough for other states to make the basic crime a

11

capital offense.

12

states require an aggravating circumstance, that the

13

State before the Court does not; an aggravating

14

circumstance that makes the offender more culpable or

15

the crime more serious.

16

our bean counting analysis.

17

We look to see whether if the other

We exclude those states from

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm not sure that

18

the sort of trends that they look to in Roper and

19

Atkins -- I mean, you had different crimes that carried

20

the capital punishment as well.

21

looking at trends in that regard.

22

MR. FISHER:

I don't think we're

If we're looking at trends,

23

perhaps I can leave you with this:

Again, remember what

24

we have in terms of a trend.

25

past 30 years is returned to the place that we were 30

All we have done in the

59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

years ago in Coker.

2

opinion, six states make child rape a capital offense.

3

Through all the might and effort of proponents of these

4

laws, what they've been able to accomplish over 31 years

5

is to bring it back exactly where we were in Coker this.

6

In Coker when you read that

This Court's whole Eighth Amendment

7

jurisprudence is based on the idea that a few states may

8

well have laws making something a capital crime and may

9

choose to be outliers, but the very notion of this

10

Court's proportionality jurisprudence is that when

11

states are outliers, and especially in a case like this,

12

when even are those outlier states impose the death

13

penalty so rarely and freakishly, that is a situation

14

where the Eighth Amendment does not tolerate it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15
16

Thank you,

Mr. Fisher.

17

The case is submitted.

18

(Whereupon, at 11:24 a.m., the case in the

19

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
