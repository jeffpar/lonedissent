CHIEF

v. the Georgia State Board of Equalization.

6

Mr. Phillips.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. PHILLIPS::

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
Congress in what is now Section 11501(b)(1)

12

crafted what this Court described as a straightforward

13

approach to determining whether a State is unlawfully

14

taxing railroad property.

15

formula that is set out in a pictorial form on page 6 of

16

the Petitioner's brief, and I think it's probably easier

17

to kind of follow along on that.

18

Congress said is that the court in making a

19

determination as to whether there's an illegal tax

20

considers the assessed value of rail transportation

21

property as the numerator on the left side of the

22

fraction, compares that to the true market value of rail

23

transportation property, and then compares that ratio to

24

the ratio created by examining the assessed value of

25

other commercial and industrial property over the true

Congress used a precise

What basically

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

market value.

2

three out of four of those variables are agreed to by

3

the parties, so the only issue in this case is what

4

constitutes the true market value of the rail

5

transportation property within the meaning of that

6

statute.

7

Fortunately, in this particular case

This Court in Burlington Northern first

8

evaluated the language of this statute and held, in what

9

I think the Court later would describe as a

10

straightforward fashion, that 10501(b)(1) declares that

11

the district court -- for the district court, that it is

12

necessary for that court to determine what the true

13

market values of the respective properties are.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is it realistic to think

15

that you can calculate with any degree of precision what

16

the true market value of CSX's property is?

17

of values that were calculated by both of these experts

18

are really astonishing, from 12.3 billion to 8.1 billion

19

for Dickerson, from 9.3 to 5.9 for Tegarden.

20

$3 or $4 billion doesn't mean anything.

21

can this be done with any precision or is it more

22

realistic just to say that what the district court would

23

have to do is to figure out whether the State's

24

calculation is within some reasonable range?

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

The range

It's like

What is the -

No, I think it's pretty clear
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that Congress did not adopt that particular formulation.

2

What Congress tasked the district court with doing was

3

determining the true market value.

4

footnote 8 of the district court's opinion, I think he

5

does a fairly interesting job of explaining what that

6

would normally mean.

7

case I would take in all of the expert testimony from

8

the railroad, I would take in all of the expert

9

testimony of the State, I would evaluate them and I

He says:

And if you look at

In an ordinary valuation

10

would come up with a conclusion as to what I think is

11

the true market value.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

district court to in addition determine which

14

methodology most accurately reflects that true market

15

value?

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And do you want the

No, I don't You want to be able

18

to challenge the state's chosen methodology for

19

determining market value?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

I think every facet of

21

the question of, that goes into the determination of

22

what is a true market value.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if the, so if the

24

district court says this methodology, Methodology A,

25

most accurately yields true market value, that is giving
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

rise to a Federal rule of determining value, isn't it?
MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

I think all it says is

3

that in this particular case under these particular

4

circumstances that methodology led to what was the true

5

market value.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I don't see

7

how it varies based on the particular circumstances.

8

he says I think, you know, whatever it is, discounted

9

value approach is the best way for determining market

10

value, he's not going to in the next case or the

11

district court isn't going to be able to say, I think

12

reproduction cost is the best method.

13

establish a Federal rule for what is the best way of

14

determining market value.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

If

You're going to

Mr. Chief Justice, I think

16

that's not accurate.

17

the circumstances change every day.

18

pretty simple example.

19

district court decides to use discounted cash flow.

20

year 2 it turns out that CSX or some other railroad

21

property is sold, so that you have an actual direct

22

sales comparison data available to you by which to make

23

the market value.

24
25

I think what will happen is that
Let's just take a

Let's assume that in year 1 the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
happens once every 25 years.

In

That happens, that

If you prevail on a method

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that you think is more favorable to railroads before a

2

particular district court, you're going to cite that

3

district court in the next case that you've got and you

4

say:

5

they said Method A is a better way of determining market

6

value.

7

Look a district court's already looked at this and

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

I'm sure that's true

8

that we'll cite it, but the reality is that the district

9

court in the second case is not bound by the decision of

10

the district court in the first case.

11

every single one of these -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the truth is

So if a district

13

court says in one case Method A is the best way to get

14

market value and another district court says Method B

15

and they both appeal, the court of appeals is going to

16

have to resolve that conflict, isn't it?

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, at the end of the day

18

the district court's going to make a valuation.

19

going to say that this is the true market value.

20

determination is a question of fact and therefore, yes,

21

the court of appeals will evaluate that to determine

22

whether or not that fact is clearly erroneous.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's
That

I think you said that CSX

24

has properties in 15 States that use the unit method of

25

calculation.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

I believe that's correct.
So if you challenge all of

3

those there could be 15 different district court

4

findings on true market value, and so within each

5

circuit the court of appeals would have to decide which

6

district court was correct as a matter of fact?

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

Sure, Justice Alito, that's

8

exactly what could happen.

But the reality is is that

9

that's exactly what's been going on since the statute

10

was enacted in 1976.

11

that have to be evaluated and, as the AAR's amicus brief

12

points out, there have been 12 cases on this particular

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but it's

20

already been pointed out if the range is a variable of

21

$4 billion I think it probably is worth their while to

22

challenge what they think is a low valuation.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

Well, blissfully, more

24

often than not it turns out that the overvaluation are

25

not nearly that stark.

But I think that goes to the
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

core point here, which is that if this Court concludes

2

like the Eleventh Circuit did, which is that there is no

3

basis for challenging the methodology, then it would

4

have been completely within the province of the State of

5

Georgia to say, we're going to adopt a stock and debt

6

method, which virtually everybody recognizes is not an

7

accurate way to determine true market value, that that

8

number would have been $12.2 billion.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if we were to

10

adopt a different approach which said that you can

11

challenge the methodology, methodology, when different

12

methodologies are used, but if the State is using the

13

same methodology that's their choice?

14

the only other alternative is to have the Federal

15

judiciary develop a Federal rule about what methodology

16

has to be used.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

It seems to me

Well, I don't think there's

18

ever a reason why the Federal court has to adopt a

19

single methodology and I don't think that's what

20

Congress intended.

21

what happens in every run of the mine valuation case

22

that comes up in either State or Federal court, which is

23

that each side presents its best guess as to what the

24

true market value is and the district court resolves

25

those differences and comes out with a number that the

MR. PHILLIPS:

Is there a standard Federal

If you read footnote 8 of the

11

district court's opinion, the district judge says, if

12

this were a typical valuation case what I would have

13

done is I would have listened to the railroad, I would

14

have listened to the State and I would have made a

15

judgment as to what I think is the right -

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Isn't that how it

17

works in utility rate regulation?

18

standard Federal method of determining what rates affect

19

the taking of property -

20
21

MR. PHILLIPS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, if it's

challenged -

24
25

But that's because there's

usually --which rates affect the taking of property?

Isn't there in fact a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

in a public utility.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

But that's because that's

4

regulated by a Federal agency that formulates a very

5

precise approach typically.

6

that -- and that approach governs every utility subject

7

to the jurisdiction of FERC.

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

question.

But there's nothing like

I was going to ask this

Is it -- would it be permitted for a State to

10

say that, with respect to utilities and certain

11

industries, including railroads, we use valuation Method

12

A, with respect to commercial rental real estate

13

property we use valuation Method B?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Is that permitted?

It's permitted for them to

15

use different methodologies because typically they do.

16

The reality is they almost never use the same

17

methodology for determining railroad property as they do

18

for other commercial and industrial property because the

19

data that are available for the two are never the same.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So is a large part of the

21

argument you would make that other utilities are

22

comparable or not comparable to a railroad?

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

You would make that argument,

24

but you'd also make an argument as to sort of what data

25

are available in any particular case to allow a
11

2

particular methodology to be used.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose an accounting

3

journal or some prestigious group of accountants and tax

4

appraisers came up with a new theory for evaluating

5

railroad property and it was conceded by all to be

6

highly accurate.

7

railroad and different methodologies for all other

8

utilities all over the country?

9

Could they use just that for the

MR. PHILLIPS:

At the end of the day the

10

test here is purely a results-driven test.

It doesn't

11

tell the State what methodologies to use on either side

12

of the equation.

13

process you end up with a ratio between assessed and

14

true market value for each that's within 5 percent.

What it says is at the end of the

15

THE COURT:

Mr. Phillips -

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So that if had the

17

Platonic, the ideal valuation method, the State could

18

use it only if it ended up with the right ratio?

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the State can use

20

any -- the State can assess any way it wants to in

21

defense of its ultimate outcome.

22
23
24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in the end it has to

have the right ratio.
MR. PHILLIPS:

At the outcome it has to have

the right ratio. That's clearly what Congress intended.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

I mean, this language could not be more straightforward.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, Congress uses the

3

word "true market value" and under this hypothetical I

4

come very close to true market value, and you say it

5

doesn't work.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, my guess is that the

7

district judge in that situation would probably say that

8

that is the true market value.

thought your submission was that even if is true market

15

value for the railroad, the ratio still has to be in

line if the methodology is different.

is that's a finding of fact, I assume.

Yes, Justice Scalia.

question is whether or not if you start out -- I reached

20

these facts because I used reproduction costs as my

method of valuation, and your submission is going to be

an answer within 20 percent margin of error, up or down,

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

As I understand the way this

statute applies, this is not a statute that worries

5

about sort of how you get to the numbers.

6

driven largely by what data are available and what do we

past to value this particular property.

it's a determination which is based upon facts.

are good reasons in fact to choose method A rather than

I'm talking about reviewing

15

the judgment of the State authority in choosing one

method rather than another.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

And the answer to

18

that is that Congress didn't intend to set this up as a

19

said in Burlington Northern, make the necessary

for determining what the value -- what the true value of

the railroad property is.

can vary depending upon the methodology chosen.

methodology chosen is dependent upon good facts, to pick

one or the other; and therefore, doesn't the very -- the

upon the methodology?

No, I don't think so.

AMICUS CURAIE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the court:
Congress did not, in the 4-R Act, establish
a right to obtain in Federal court administrative review
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of State valuations.

Rather, it established a Federal

2

right against State discrimination in which the railroad

3

could bring a de novo suit in Federal court to vindicate

4

that right.

5

value that could be generated by generally accepted

6

methodologies -- 6 billion to 12.4 billion, in this

7

case.

8

that any reasonable methodology, by which they mean any

9

methodology that is reasonable in the abstract that may

10

have been approved by this Court in the 1800's, a State

11

could hide any variety of discriminations within that

12

rubric.

13

Federal court review under the 4-R Act.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Justice Alito pointed out the wide range of

Clearly, if one were to accept the State's rule

There would be very little, if any meat to

What if you take my

15

variation on it, and that is, we don't defer it to the

16

State's choice in the abstract, i.e. if we -- if there

17

are 10 methods, as long as it's one of the 10 it's okay?

18

Rather, if we defer at all, we defer it to the choice

19

that is made to -- to accept one or the other

20

methodology, and we look to the reasons that the State

21

gives for making that choice?

22

teeth out of the Federal act?

23

Would that take all the

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, I think that

24

it would, to a large extent, undermine the right and

25

protection that Congress intended.
20
Alderson Reporting Company

And partly, I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the -- Your Honor's question is based on a faulty

2

premise, and that is that the State uses a single

3

methodology in carrying out its valuation.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Your point is well taken.

5

It has a variety, and then it makes some kind of a

6

judgmental choice as between the results it gets.

7

that I guess just makes my question more complicated.

8

As long as it -- as long as it has good reasons for

9

selecting, let's say the three competing methodologies

But

10

that it uses, and as long as it has a rational -- gives

11

a rational basis for the ultimate resolution, should we

12

not or should a court not defer to the choices?

13

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, I think that

14

to call the weighing of the three evidences of value

15

that might be generated by cost income, sales methods, a

16

choice of methodology to which the Federal court is

17

required to defer is a misnomer, because it really is an

18

exercise of judgment with respect to the facts of the

19

case and the reliability of the data available.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But doesn't the judgment

21

get exercised in determining what facts are good reasons

22

for selecting this methodology, or this variant of

23

methodology, for this particular case?

24
25

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

I think Your Honor

is correct, that the -- because you're pointing out that
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

really, the choice among methodologies is more a

2

question of what are the facts on the ground, what is

3

the reliable, available data that could be used in

4

generating these different evidences of value.

5

court's role, in our view, is to consider all of the

6

evidences of value, not just the State's evidence.

7

would be the proper approach in a suit for

8

administrative review -- of administrative determination

9

by the State, but is a de novo proceeding in which the

And the

That

10

court is to consider all evidence of value to determine,

11

to its own satisfaction, what the true market value of

the railroad is.

14

with Justice Souter's test for the district court review

of the State, might you agree with it as applied to the

16

the court of appeals review is reviewing a determination

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

I do believe -

yes, that the review of the appellate court of the

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I didn't ask whether it was

error -- for clearly erroneous review, by the court of

6

appeals, begins with assessing whether the methodology

7

used by the district court is reasonable.

I asked whether a reasonable basis for plain

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, again, I

don't think that it's fair to assume that the district
court would have used a single methodology.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Rather -

Well, a combination of

12

methodologies.

I'm talking about -- when I say

13

methodology, I mean even if it uses a combination of

14

five different ones, okay.

15

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I -

Is it reasonable?

How do

17

you propose to have the court of appeals review the

18

district court's selection of methodologies?

19

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, it would be,

20

as Justice Souter suggested, a question of whether those

21

methodologies -- whether the evidence in the case

22

indicated that those methodologies were reliable

23

indications of value.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Is it clearly erroneous if

it may not be the very best, but it's ballpark and there

5

is disagreement as to what the very best would be?

6

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

I do believe that's

7

true, and that is in the nature of the appellate court's

8

review of the factual finding by the district court.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this question?

10

I understood you to be arguing that the district court

11

made an error of law in not receiving evidence of a

12

different methodology offered by the railroads.

13

also, if they conceivably -- if I understood you

correctly, you could send the case back, they could then

receive the evidence and come to precisely the same

11

industrial properties, it specifically says that it is

12

to be proved to the satisfaction of the Court.

13

14

unreasonable to construe the statute to lead to

MR. CALVERT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the court.
Subsection (b)(1) constitutes a narrow

11

exception to the normal rule of Federal non-interference

12

in State tax administration that is designed to prohibit

13

a specific type of tax discrimination.

contends here is that Congress meant this

15

anti-discrimination provision to secure for the

16

railroads what no other taxpayer to our knowledge

17

currently has.

18

come into Federal court, and to have a Federal judge

19

redetermine the market value of its property for State

State's choice of a reasonable valuation method.

15

It doesn't seem to

District court is to find true

MR. CALVERT:

Well, I think in large part,

16

the railroad's argument is it places on the one word

17

"true" and the term "true market value" a weight that it

18

cannot bear.

19

this case, and this is confirmed by the legislative

20

history, acknowledged that the word "true market value"

21

meant the same as "fair market value" or "market value."

22

The complaint that the railroads filed in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's a very strange way of

23

saying the district judge is to -- is to ask whether the

24

State has used one of a number of reasonable methods of

25

determining the market value.

To say, go find the true

29
Alderson Reporting Company

market value is a very strange way of saying that, and

2

that's what you, that's what you're saying it means.

3

Congress had said the district court is to find fair

would seem less strange.

be a range -- any case like this as evidenced by the

8

appraisals -- the appraisal prepared by the railroad's

appraiser, as evidenced by the State's appraiser.

is going to be a range of possible market values.

Why would your position be

any stronger if it used fair market value?

And we think there is going to

MR. CALVERT:

Well, Your Honor I think in

the same way that CSX -

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. CALVERT:

Or any weaker?

Well, Your Honor, the way that

17

the railroad says you have to look for the one value

18

that's true, I would say that if the statute said "fair

19

market value" the question is there could be many market

20

values that are fair.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

false "fair market value"?

23

thing.

24
25

MR. CALVERT:
Honor.

What do you mean, we have
I never heard of such a

I don't believe so, Your

But I think -- I think there is a range of
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

possible market values that can be considered fair.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't the point not that

3

anyone is denying that there can be a range, that there

4

-- everybody agrees that there is not here, simply

5

because there is not one methodology, there is not an

6

exact science which is operating?

7

point the point that Justice Scalia made, that when

8

Congress uses the term "true market value," when it has

9

a criterion of truth, the one thing that does seem to be

But isn't the real

10

clear is that, if you are looking for truth, you do not

11

defer to a party in interest?

12

point?

13

follow that methodology is up to the assessment of the

14

district court.

15

And isn't that the one

And if you accept that point, then doesn't it

MR. CALVERT:

I would say that's true, Your

16

Honor, but I would say that the statute does not plainly

17

lead to that result.

18
19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

How could it say it more

plainly than using the criterion of truth?

20

MR. CALVERT:

Well, again, Your Honor -

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Truth -- whatever truth

22

means, it doesn't mean deferring to a party in interest.

23

Isn't that correct?

24
25

MR. CALVERT:

Well, I don't believe, Your

Honor, that it is possible to say with any type of
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

absolute certainty or precision that one JUSTICE SOUTER:

We all accept that.

The

3

question is not whether we're talking about rocket

4

science in valuation.

5

deferring to a choice made by the party in interest?

6

And doesn't the criterion of truth imply that we do not?

7

The question is whether we are

MR. CALVERT:

No, Your Honor, I don't think

8

that it does.

Again, if the -- if the statute had said

9

what it easily could have said and what the legislative

10

history says it could have said and what CSX complaint

11

in this case acknowledged it could have said, that what

12

the district court had to find was the market value of

13

the property.

14
15
16
17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So Congress in effect was

engaging in Pontius Pilate's exercise, what is truth?
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I was expecting you to say,

that what is truth?

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. CALVERT:

Your Honor, I would say that

20

the statute does not plainly require that if a State has

21

determined the market value of the railroad by correctly

22

applying a reasonable valuation method, that the statute

23

an ambiguously allows the taxpayer to come in and

24

challenge that -- not just the application of that

25

method but the -- but the methodology itself.
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if you limit it to

2

the application and not the methodology, then Congress's

3

overriding goal was there was a problem with

4

overevaluation of the railroad's property, and Congress

5

was responding to that problem of overevaluating the

6

property.

7

application, then you are not going to have as vigorous

8

a check on over evaluation as you would have if you

9

could -- if you could reach back to the methodology.

10

But if you limit the challenger to just the

MR. CALVERT:

Your Honor, I think what CSX

11

would like in this case is to turn the Federal district

12

court, the judge into a board of equalization who has to

13

-- who has to consider every -- each and every objection

14

to each and every decision that the State that is made

15

in valuing its property.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But what you are saying is

17

that the -- that the court is simply being turned into a

18

grade school math teacher who looks to see whether the

19

sums are added up correctly.

20

Congress had in mind.

21

MR. CALVERT:

That can't be what

Well, no, Your Honor.

That's

22

not our position.

In fact, the objections that CSX had

23

specifically to the State's application of the

24

discounted cash flow were more than what could be fairly

25

described as checking the math.

It wasn't a situation

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

where one number had had the decimal point in the wrong

2

place but there was -- there was days of expert

3

testimony, for example, regarding whether the State's

4

use of a 6.3 terminal growth rate in the discounted cash

5

flow was an appropriate number for this railroad.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In other words, there was

7

-- there was a contest about the judgment used by the

8

State in selecting one point of datum in its

9

calculation, right?

10

MR. CALVERT:

That among other -

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

If that kind of

12

judgment -- if it makes sense under the statute to put

13

that kind of judgment in question, why doesn't it

14

equally make sense under the statute to put other

15

questions of judgment such as the selection of the

16

methodology to which the data point in fact is relevant?

17

Where do you stop?

18

MR. CALVERT:

Well, we think it is -- the

19

difference, Your Honor, is, while we believe that a

20

State should have -- should have the right to choose

21

among the various reasonable types of valuation methods

22

that can be used in a case like this -

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I know that's why you

24

think.

My question is, if you agree that it's

25

appropriate under the congressional statute to challenge
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

one issue of judgment, why isn't it equally appropriate

2

to challenge other issues of judgment, i.e., selection

3

of methodology?

4

MR. CALVERT:

Well, because it's one thing

5

to say that the State can choose the valuation formula;

6

it's another thing that the State is able to dictate how

7

you fill in the variables.

8

going to use the discounted cash flow analysis but

9

here's the way we're going to -

10

If a State can say we're

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Each one, as I understand

11

it, is a question of judgment about what is appropriate

12

on the facts of this case, or these kinds of cases.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The trouble is you can't

14

find a -- it is a line, but it's not a line you can

15

derive from true market value.

16

but what in the statute suggests that that's what you

17

should do?

18

MR. CALVERT:

I mean, you can do it,

Well, Your Honor, I believe

19

what you have to find in the statute, because this is a

20

limited exception to the rule that Federal courts will

21

not interfere with the State's administration of its own

22

tax system, is -- I think you need to find something in

23

the statute which plainly allows the Federal courts to

24

get into the minutia of not just the way in which the

25

discounted cash flow formula has been applied or not the
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

way in which a stock-and-debt formula has been applied,

2

but its choice at the -- at the very beginning to use

3

those methodologies.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

The reason that they do

that is because none of these methods comes even close

to working out what the company is really worth because,

12

as checks one on the other.

number, but if you look at a few other methods, you'll

Now, the railroad simply

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a railroad running through the center of this city, of

2

what it would be worth if the property were sold on the

3

private market, you'd get an astronomical number.

4

the chances of this number being higher than the sales

5

value of private property is not great.

6

So

So, if you've come in with some method that

7

puts it higher than that, well, why shouldn't they be

8

able to come in and say:

9

with this method, which in our opinion is not a fair

10

method.

11

going to say they can't, then there is no check on the

12

State working out a method that discriminates, as

13

Justice Ginsburg said, seriously against the railroads.

14

Now, why not?

Look, look what they've got

Because after all, if you're

MR. CALVERT:

Well, I think -- I think the

15

result of that, Your Honor, is -- is you're going to

16

have a Federal court setting a Federal standard of

17

valuation for Georgia.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

What they're going to do is

19

they're simply going to let people present the evidence

20

as you've heard, which will have 15 valuation methods if

21

they want, all serving each as checks on the other.

22

There's no single method.

23

that result?

24
25

MR. CALVERT:

So why would you end up with

Well, Your Honor, that's what

-- that's what CSX is -- is arguing here today, but

1

that's not what they argued in the district court.

2

--

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They

I thought -- I thought

4

you conceded that that was what it would be, because you

5

said that the Federal court would be turned into a board

6

of equalization, and a board of equalization is not

7

making grand law for setting precedent.

8
9

MR. CALVERT:

Well, I think, Your Honor,

what CSX asked in this case is that -- they have taken

10

the position, and I believe they still take it for this

11

Court, that a stock-and-debt method will never give a

12

reliable estimate of the value of the railroad.

13

want -- what they want to come out of this litigation is

14

the State of Georgia cannot use that at all.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So they

I think what they want is

16

to be able to attack the methodology and not be limited

17

to the application of whatever methodology the State

18

prefers.

19

MR. CALVERT:

That's correct, Your Honor,

20

but the point I'm that trying to make is that what they

21

-- what they want to see come out of this case is the

22

State of Georgia -- not simply that the State of Georgia

23

couldn't use the stock-and-debt methodology for this tax

24

year; they want a ruling that basically says it can't

25

use it for any year.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, I don't think they're

2

not going to get that from this Court, any more than

3

they could get it from the Court of Appeals.

4

Court of Appeals can say, it seems to me, is that the

5

methodology that the district court used was not clearly

6

erroneous.

7

All the

I think another district court in a later

8

year could probably use a different methodology, which

9

would again be affirmed by the Court of Appeals because

10

it was not clearly erroneous.

11

think either the Court of Appeals or this Court is

12

placing any stamp on a particular methodology.

13

MR. CALVERT:

We're not -- I don't

But -- but Your Honor, that is

14

what they tried to get from the district court in this

15

case.

16
17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe they did, but they're

not going to get it here.

18

(Laughter.)

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this question

20

about your position?

Supposing Dickerson had adopted

21

the stock-and-debt method and taken the $12 million -

22

$12 billion figure and said that's really a reasonable

23

basis, and then he ended up with that value.

24

be able to defend that decision with precisely the same

25

arguments that you're making today?
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Would you

MR. CALVERT:

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

Yes, Your Honor.
Well, that's what -

I'm sorry.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I just wanted to be sure.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought that would

6

be part of your reply to Justice Breyer, that you had

7

five different methodologies here and you chose the

8

lowest one; and the question really is how many more

9

methodologies do you have to look at if you're going to

10

choose the lowest one in each case.

11

MR. CALVERT:

12

Well, and that is what we did

in this case, Your Honor.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

If it had been -- I'm

14

sorry -- if it had been Dickerson's methodology at the

15

last step to choose the highest value, would that be

16

reasonable?

17

MR. CALVERT:

Again, Your Honor, I think -

18

I think a State could do that.

You're still within the

19

range of value.

20

that in an effort to overvalue the railroads, or to

21

discriminate against them or to treat them differently

22

than other taxpayers, I think you might have a problem

23

under the statute, but I don't think it's a problem

24

under (b)(1).

25

(b)(4) which is the -

I will say this.

If the State had done

I think that would be a problem under

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This State appraiser as I

2

understand it had never done an appraisal before of -

3

of this magnitude, right?

4

MR. CALVERT:

No, Your Honor.

He's done

5

well over a thousand appraisals involving the

6

application of the unit rule.

7

had not done before is provide a written narrative

8

report much like the railroad's appraiser did, but the

9

What he had -- what he

11

when he did his full appraisal report, it includes

12

certain narrative materials, certain explanation of the

13

various methods he used.

14

Then

But -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm looking for the

15

footnote, but I -- I was, I was impressed by what seemed

16

to me the -- the vast difference in -- in qualifications

17

and experience of the -- of the State appraiser and of

18

the expert who was brought in by the railroads at the

19

trial.

20

to defer to -- to this novice in the field, and -- and

21

not look at the -- at the testimony of -- of someone who

22

has done a lot of it before.

23

And it seemed to me quite absurd to say we have

MR. CALVERT:

No.

The State's appraiser,

24

Your Honor, had done, had done well over -- well over a

25

thousand of these types of appraisals.
41

I'm sorry.

I must have

We have our own footnote.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

I didn't -

skipped that.

Did you have a response -

did you have a response to that footnote?

That is footnote 3, Your

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of yours?

MR. CALVERT:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of our brief.
You know, if this

17

comes down as it probably will in every case, to a

18

battle of competing experts, are you aware of any other

19

area where we say that a district court cannot look at

20

the methodology used by an expert in determining whether

21

or not to give credence to the expert's opinion?

22

MR. CALVERT:

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24
25

No, I'm not, Your Honor.
So why should we

create a special rule here for the State?
MR. CALVERT:

Well, this is a -- this is a
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

special statute and again I think what CSX is asking for

2

this -- for this Court to do is create a special rule

3

for it which gives it, unique among taxpayers, as far as

4

we are aware, the right to come into Federal court and

5

challenge each and every decision that the State has

6

made in valuing property for property taxes and have the

7

Federal court redetermine that value.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, if -- I take it to

determine how far you could go with that, I take it

10

though in your view if the State's appraiser had never

11

done an appraisal before in his life, if he were plucked

12

off the street by the State and said, you know,

13

"appraise the railroad property; we are making you a

14

State appraiser," on your view the district court could

15

not look behind that?

16

MR. CALVERT:

Well, the district court could

17

certainly thoroughly examine the way in which the -- the

18

reasonable valuation methodologies that the State

19

selected were applied.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Exactly.

But the selection

21

of the methodology by the guy off the street could not

22

be examined.

23
24
25

MR. CALVERT:

Well -- well, Your Honor, we

think the methodology has to at least be reasonable.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it's -- it's one of

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the recognized methodologies.

2
3

MR. CALVERT:

I think if the State has used

--

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It happens to be the one

5

that gives the highest number.

6

methodology and there are certain -- certainly examples

7

in which that methodology has been used, and I take it

8

that if the guy off the street picks one of those, and

9

that's all we know about it, the district court on your

10

But it's a recognized

view cannot look behind it.

11

MR. CALVERT:

I'd say that's correct.

If

12

it's a widely used accepted valuation methodology like

13

the ones the State used in this case, that the question

14

--

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's what you have

16

here.

I've looked -- I've looked at your footnote and I

17

see that indeed Mr. Dickerson did have over 30 years

18

experience including well over a thousand valuations -

19

performed under the unit rule; performed under one

20

method of evaluation, right?

21

MR. CALVERT:

The -

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the whole issue here is

23

that that method of valuation, however expert he is at

24

it, is not proper here.

25

are other ones that should have been brought to bear.

It doesn't work.

Both sides agree that the unit

The question then is

8

how to -- how to determine what the unit value of the

10

the unit rule is appropriate.

Correct.

I guess the term

means unit rule -

21

MR. CALVERT:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23
24
25

Right.
--or you could think how

under the unit rule, what is the MR. CALVERT:

That's right, Your Honor.

If

I could make -- if I could make one point about the unit
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rule and the choice between the unit rule and what we

2

refer to as the summation approach, the specific dispute

3

in this case has been between the various methods for

4

determining what the unit value of the company was for

5

2002 under the unit rule -- but the argument that CSX is

6

making in this case would also put -- put into play a

7

State's most fundamental methodological choice between

8

the unit rule and the summation approaches, and CSX's

9

reply brief admits as such.

10

The railroads had made -- had made such an

11

argument in the Chesapeake Western case out of the

12

Fourth Circuit where -- where Virginia's courts had held

13

that the unit rule was not an appropriate valuation

14

method under their statutes to arrive at fair market

15

value, the railroads came in and said under the 4-R Act,

16

we are entitled to put on proof under the unit rule as

17

to what our fair market value, that the Federal statute

18

makes all that open; the district court has to consider

19

all that evidence.

20

Circuit rejected that argument, but that's the

21

implication.

22

And what the -- and the Fourth

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if what if the

23

State elected to use reproduction cost as its valuation

24

method, which I guess everybody agrees vastly overstates

25

the value of the railroad?
46
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. CALVERT:

Well I think the problem, Your

Honor, with reproduction cost is -- is how to -- is how

3

to accurately account for obsolescence.

4

understanding of the objection -

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

My

So if there are

6

problems with a particular methodology, the methodology

7

can be challenged?

8
9

MR. CALVERT:

It's possible, Your Honor,

that a reproduction cost methodology might -- might so

10

inadequately deal with the issue of obsolescence that

11

you just have to say that's not a reasonable

12

methodology, as applied to railroads.

13
14

JUSTICE SOUTER:
your theory?

15

MR. CALVERT:

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

17
18

How could you say it on

Pardon me?
How could you say it

consistently with your position here?
MR. CALVERT:

Well, I think, Your Honor, the

19

court is allowed to examine whether you have a -

20

whether the State has used a reasonable methodology.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then why doesn't the court

22

have an opportunity or the right to examine whether any

23

particular methodology is reasonable as applied to this

24

taxpayer and this kind of property at this time?

25

MR. CALVERT:

Well, I think that goes to the
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question of whether you have properly applied a

2

reasonable valuation method, and there is -

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I thought -- I thought you

4

were saying that the reproduction method had such severe

5

problems associated with it that it simply would not be

6

a fair methodology to use and at least a reviewing

7

court, a district court could -- could draw that

8

conclusion.

9

I thought that was your answer.
MR. CALVERT:

Well, I think it depends, Your

10

Honor, on if you have a reproduction cost method that

11

you have applied to property that -- property that has

12

only just recently been purchased, then I don't think

13

you're going to have a problem with it at all, even -

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We are talking about the

15

railroads like CSX, and I thought your answer was that

16

a -- a district court could conclude that as applied in

17

a case like this, that there are so many problems that

18

it simply would not be a reasonable valuation method.

19

MR. CALVERT:

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

21

24
25

All right.

Then well then

how do you draw a line?

22
23

I -- I think that is possible.

MR. CALVERT:

Well again, Your Honor, I

think JUSTICE SOUTER:

If you can do that, why

can't it do what -- what your brother is saying it
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

should do in this case?

2

MR. CALVERT:

Well, I think, Your Honor,

3

that in -- in -- in --

4

argument they have made in this case.

5

again, I don't think that is the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, let's assume I'm

6

making that argument now in my question.

7

you draw the line that you want to draw?

8
9
10

MR. CALVERT:

Why -- why can

Well again, I think that goes

to whether the application is going to be -- is going to
be reasonable in the particular situation.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

And your

12

argument is that it's not reasonable because it must

13

overstate the value by a particular percentage or

14

number.

15
16

And I think Justice Souter's question is:
Well, where do you draw the line?

17

If you say it's not reasonable because it

18

overstates value by 50 percent, is a methodology that

19

overstates value by 20 percent reasonable or not -

20

MR. CALVERT:

Well, I -

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- keeping in mind

22

all the methodologies here range from 8 -- 6 billion to

23

12 billion.

24
25

MR. CALVERT:

And I -- I think, if you

looked at the mid- point of the ranges that each -- each
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the appraisers had, you would have a variation,

2

maybe, of about 20 percent either way.

3

don't think that's going to be determinative as to

4

whether you've got a reasonable methodology, whether

5

it's been properly applied, and what that range is.

6

think that's the nature of the -- of the appraisal task

7

that States have.

8
9
10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Again, I

I

Mr. Calvert, can you tell

me how this thing works, or how it may work in the
future?
Does the State just whip up a number and lay

12

it on the railroad, or -- or, in fact, is there some

13

discussion each year between the railroad's experts and

14

the -- and the State's experts as to what the right

15

number should be?

16

MR. CALVERT:

What happens, Your Honor, is

17

that the railroad returns are filed with the State; and

18

there is a period of time during which the State

19

examines those returns, takes the evaluation

20

methodologies that it has selected, applies it to the

21

data that it has for those particular companies, comes

22

up with numbers.

23

is shared with the railroads.

24
25

Those -- that information, typically,

For them to come back and say:

think you've used cost of capital that's too low; we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

think you've done -- done this; this number really, we

2

believe, should be -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

So there is some

4

give-and-take discussion before the State comes down

5

firmly and says:

Cough up the money?

6

MR. CALVERT:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9

Typically, Your Honor.
Okay.
I take it this question

about the unit rule -- I take it Georgia is figuring out

10

what the entire value of the railroad is throughout the

11

country.

12

determination to apply their unit rules?

Have other States had to make the same

13

MR. CALVERT:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let's say, do Tennessee

15

and Mississippi have to also apply the unit rule to

16

value the property of this particular railroad?

17

MR. CALVERT:

I think -- I think the

18

majority of States that value railroad property use the

19

unit rule.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Is it admissible evidence

21

to find out what other -- figures other States have come

22

up with?

23

aren't you -

Because you're all taking the same answer,

24

MR. CALVERT:

I -

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- if you all use the unit

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rule?

2

MR. CALVERT:

We are, Your Honor, though if

3

a State is using a different methodology to determine

4

the unit rule, I think you would probably expect -

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What if the evidence shows

6

that 49 States have come up with a valuation of $5

7

billion, and you use a method that comes up with $8

8

billion?

Would that be admissible evidence?

9
10

MR. CALVERT:

I think it probably would be,

Your Honor.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And does the record

12

contain any such evidence in this case?

13

other States have found.

14

MR. CALVERT:

Do we know what

I think the evidence in this

15

case was that the State of Georgia's unit value, at

16

least within the southeast States, was -- was the

17

largest number.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19

MR. CALVERT:

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Was the highest?

That's correct.
Doesn't that raise some

21

suspicion about maybe they have a different approach

22

than is commonly applied seeking precisely the same

23

answer to precisely the same question?

24
25

MR. CALVERT:

Well, Your Honor, I think our

-- our response is that we believe that in 2002 what the
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

State did was not only to make some changes in its

2

valuation methodologies, but it also made a fairly

3

significant change in the income numbers that the State

4

was using to apply its discounted cash flow analysis.

5

And specifically what it did:

It started

6

using -- instead of numbers from the regulatory report,

7

the R-1 report that the railroads filed with the Surface

8

Transportation Board, it began to use income numbers

9

from the annual reports to shareholders.

10

There is a significant difference in those

11

numbers, and the testimony in this case was that the 47

12

percent increase that CSX saw in its assessment from

13

2001 to 2002 was attributable to the difference in the

14

income numbers that were being used.

15

I suspect that for many of the other States

16

that have low numbers for CSX, that they still use

17

numbers from the regulatory reports as opposed to the

18

annual reports.

19

So that's one reason that I believe we've

20

got -- we had such a larger number for 2002 than many

21

other States, because our appraiser was looking to the

22

correct income numbers.

23

If I could, just in the remaining time that

24

I've got, I'd like to mention a couple of points.

25

CSX has contended that this line between method and
53
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

application is simply unworkable; and, therefore, the

2

Court shouldn't recognize any -- any such distinction

3

under the statute.

4

We think there are a couple points where the

5

lines are clear.

6

summation approaches.

7

Association of American Railroads acknowledges that

8

those are two different methods.

9

One is between the unit rule and the
The brief filed by the

It's not -- one could not say that a stock

10

and debt method is just an application of discounted

11

cash flow, so there are certain places where those lines

12

are clear.

13

We believe the fact that the line may not

14

always be -- or the boundaries may not always be

15

perfectly distinct, or that the test may not always be

16

what it might be easy to describe in the abstract -- it

17

doesn't mean that the distinction should not be

18

recognized at all under the statute.

19

Also, there is the way in which the Eleventh

20

Circuit formulated the test where the Eleventh Circuit

21

said a line bar between method and application was

22

between nonfactual determinations used in constructing

23

the valuation process, however broad or narrow they

24

might be.

The Court said that constitutes the method.

1

Everything else is an application.

2

The suggestion has been made by the

3

Solicitor General in their brief that -- that that means

4

as long as the State can announce or can set out its

5

valuation rule in general enough terms, make it general

6

enough, then that will become part of the method and not

7

part of the application.

8
9

I think if the Eleventh Circuit's opinion is
read in context, the Eleventh circuit didn't say that.

10

Specifically, the Eleventh circuit was

11

distinct -- was saying -- was rejecting the argument in

12

that case that only the distinction between the unit

13

rule and the summation approach is -- was the only

14

methodological distinction.

15

We think that differences in methodologies include the

16

stock and debt, the discounted cash flow, and the market

17

multiples approaches used in this case.

And the Court was saying:

18

So the Eleventh Circuit did go and consider

19

the argument that the State had -- should not have used

20

a 6.3 percent terminal growth rate in the discounted

21

cash flow analysis even though that it used that in -

22

in all -- for all public utilities.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

I will try to be brief.

First of all,

5

Justice Stevens, in response to your question on the

6

comparisons between Georgia and other States, on page 22

7

of our cert petition we pointed out that in the 2006 tax

8

year Georgia and Florida had adopted unit values of

9

$11.2 billion and $12.9 billion; whereas, every other

10

State in those jurisdictions that used the unit value

11

had an assessment value of $7.1 billion.

12

Respondent State did not question that.

13

And the

So I mean the reality is there are wide

14

swings, and it does make a difference what methodology

15

you do, and it's part of the reason why it's absolutely

16

critical that the Court should enforce the language of

17

the statute.

18

recognizes, it is the true market value.

19

As Justice Scalia quite properly

And this is not a statute like, for

20

instance, 28 U.S.C. 1254(d)(1) in AEDPA, which says the

21

Federal courts should defer to any reasonable

22

determination by the State courts in a judgment Federal

23

law.

24
25

This is a statute that vests the district
court with the exclusive authority to make the
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

determination of the true market value.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean I assume

3

that's in the normal context of the adversary process.

4

In other words, the district court does not necessarily

5

have to come up with a number independent of what the

6

parties present to it.

7

MR. PHILLIPS: No.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9
10

It can decide which

of the presentations is closer to true market value.
MR. PHILLIPS: Absolutely.

And that's -- and

11

that's exactly the point, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

isn't any single method that's out there.

13

are a series of evidences of value, and the district

14

court needs to be able to evaluate them without regard

15

to some kind of thumb on the scale of the State, in

16

favor of the State.

17

know, is there any other valuation process that would

18

work this way, the answer was no.

19

that there is nothing in this, in this statute that

20

remotely suggests that Congress would have wanted to do

21

anything other than the ordinary or typical valuation in

22

this context.

23

There

All we have

And as you asked the question, you

And the problem is

Justice Souter, I think you made the point,

24

which is the one I wanted to make in my opening

25

statement, which is how is it possible that Congress
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

recognizes decades of discrimination involving tens or

2

hundreds of millions of dollars would have said and now

3

when you get to the point of trying to correct that

4

discrimination, what are you going to do?

5

entity that's been discriminating for all of those

6

years.

7

incredible to think that that's what Congress meant.

8
9

It is at least passing strange, if not

It is much more sensible to think that
Congress wanted the district court to serve as a serious

10

check on what the state did.

11

in this case.

12

the Court to vacate and to revamp.

13

Thank you, Your Honor.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15
16
17

Defer to the

That's what we didn't get

That's what we are entitled to.

I urge

Thank you,

Mr. Phillips, the case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
