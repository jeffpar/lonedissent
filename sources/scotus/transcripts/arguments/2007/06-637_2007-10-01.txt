ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD KOERNER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KOERNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and members

10

of the Court.

11

Burlington decision, it based -- it based it based on

12

the broad remedial clause set forth in 20 U.S.C. 1415,

13

which allowed an impartial hearing officer, a state

14

review officer, or the court, itself, to grant relief

15

where appropriate.

16

In 1985 when this Court decided the

In so doing, it noted that there was no

17

other substantive section which touched and concerned

18

the issue before the Court, and that is whether an

19

individual can voluntarily remove a child and seek

20

tuition reimbursement before the conclusion of the

21

administrative and court remedies.

22

It made a point of noting that it felt it

23

was gleaning the congressional intent; and, had Congress

24

known that the administrative and court process would be

25

protracted, it would have provided a process which would

allow the child to be removed.

2

Similarly, in the sequel, the Carter case,

3

the Court made the other -- the same conclusion.

4

noted that, although the primary responsibilities to

5

educate the child in a public school, least restrictive

6

environment, there would be occasions when you would

7

place that child outside, having been in the school

23

just that paragraph, says "children placed in private

particular case, while the children would be entitled to

some small amount of Federal funding, they would not be

education.

We also noted that if a parent was

dissatisfied with the service plan, they'd have to seek

relief administratively.

They would not be entitled to
It was a

10

recognition that children who are placed in private

when children were not placed in public school but the

15

local district consented that they could not provide a

16

free appropriate public education.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, do you

6

agree that if we conclude the language is ambiguous, we

7

should defer to the Secretary's interpretation in the

8

comments accompanying the regulations?

9

MR. KOERNER:

The answer is no because the

10

Secretary's interpretation on the note in common and the

11

letter submitted to the educational consultant is

12

inconsistent with its own Federal regulation.

13

Federal reguation, titled Children Placed in Private

14

Schools When FAPE Is at Issue, also requires that you

15

previously receive -

Well, then -

But the note Assuming we would

22

think the statutory language is ambiguous, we are likely

23

to think the same language in the regulation is

24

ambiguous.

25

MR. KOERNER:

Well, Chief Justice, if it's
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ambiguous and we ought to at least discuss the nature of

2

the ambiguity, then that ambiguity under the spending

3

clause should redound to the benefit of the local

4

education district as well, for if it does not set forth

that's proposed by the school is inadequate, and they

argument based on the statutory language, so they say

all right, we are going to put him in the public school

got the placement in the private school all lined up at

the end of the 11 days.

That -- that would satisfy the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statutory definition, but when it went before the

2

impartial officer, or the State review officer, there

3

would be a very compelling argument that there was a

4

lack of cooperation, because it's not just that you're

5

in the system, but that you articulate the problems that

6

you have with the public placement.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it depends on

8

the particular circumstances.

I mean, if the parent is

9

able to show look, the school district is being very

10

unreasonable here; it's clear he is going to need more

11

than the services they were going to offer, well that

12

wouldn't have -

MR. KOERNER.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

of the other provisions.

16

MR. KOERNER:

Yes.
-- run afoul of any

My only comment, Chief

17

Justice, was that yes, that would satisfy the statutory

18

section as long as the notice was given in triple I, but

19

we would then have an argument in the individual case

20

that the parent was not cooperating.

21

of this case, where they come into the system even for a

22

minimum period and give the appropriate notice under

23

triple I, yes, that would -- it would be satisfied.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

So for the purpose

Well, why would Congress

ever have wanted to adopt a scheme like that?
9
Alderson Reporting Company

What

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

possible purpose is served by simply requiring the

2

student to be in a placement that is by definition not

3

providing a -- not providing FAPE for this very short

4

period of time?

5

It makes no sense whatsoever.

MR. KOERNER:

The reason Congress wanted to

6

provide it is the reason that this Court discussed in

7

Burlington.

8

that it was an extremely protracted process.

9

there was subject to a very long impartial hearing and

The upset of this Court in Burlington was

So that enabled the

parent to remove the child immediately and risk that -

13

MR. KOERNER:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's correct.
-- the public education

would be found inadequate.

16

MR. KOERNER:

But the reason -

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But all that section does

18

is to repeat the Burlington scenario.

It says, it

19

codifies what the Court held.

20

anything in Burlington about the situation where the

21

child was never in public education.

22

MR. KOERNER:

The Court didn't say

That's correct, but it's a

23

statute of limitations.

It says that you must receive

24

special education and related services.

25

there is no exception to the condition -- if you look at
10
Alderson Reporting Company

There is no -

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the particular statute when they refer to "may," they

2

are only talking about the relief that a court or

3

impartial hearing officer or State review officer can

4

grant.

5

must be in the system.

6

They are not talking about the predicate, you

Now you asked, Justice Alito, why do they

7

have to be in the system, and the reason is Congress

8

thought that if you're in the system and you have a

9

vested interest in the system, that because of all the

10

processes that are there, including mediation, including

11

a modified IEP, that it would increase the numbers of

12

people in terms of cooperation who want to participate

13

in the system.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought it wasn't that.

15

I thought it was simply Congress figured that there are

16

probably a lot of people in New York City, in Manhattan

17

in particular, who are going to send their kids to

18

private school, no matter what, and they can get special

19

services in private school, but what the heck, if we can

20

get $30,000 from the city to pay for it, that's fine.

21

In other words, this was meant to be an

22

option for people who wanted to go to the public schools

23

but couldn't go to the public schools because they

24

couldn't get the private services there, but it was

25

never meant to be an option for people who had no desire
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to go to public schools at all anyway, and -

2

MR. KOERNER:

I think -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- and without this

4

condition, somebody, I think the plaintiff here was

5

never in the public school, was he?

6

MR. KOERNER:

That's correct.

He never had

7

any contact with the public school at all except to

8

request a free appropriate public education.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are there not children -

10

I think there was a brief on behalf of the Autism

11

Society that says many school systems simply do not have

12

the facilities to attend to the needs of these children?

13

MR. KOERNER:

Yes, but you don't know that

14

until you've actually been subjected to the process

15

itself.

16

you had to presume that the officials in the department

17

of education of a local school district are going to do

their job.

20

you can then litigate.

Indeed in Schaffer, you, this Court said that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are there not cases where

22

school districts have said from day one, look, we don't

23

have facilities to handle this type of disability?

24
25

MR. KOERNER:

But if we don't -- if the

public schools district does not have the facilities,

1

then it will consent to a private placement to deal with

2

the particular problem it cannot deal with.

3

talking about cases where the school system believes it

4

can deal with an individual problem and at the very

5

least if the person's child comes into the system, they

6

will have the opportunity to work with the parent and

7

try to work out a situation.

8

well aware, the primary obligation is to find a public

9

education for this child, and if from day one you assume

We are only

In -- as this Court is

10

that the individual education plan is defective, not

11

only is it inconsistent with Schaffer, it's inconsistent

12

with the whole statutory scheme which is set up to try

13

to work cooperatively.

14

Indeed -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But isn't it true that

15

the parent will never be reimbursed?

16

parent that Justice Scalia has hypothesized, will never

17

get one penny of that tuition unless that parent carries

18

the burden -- the parent would have the burden of

19

showing that there was no appropriate public education?

20

MR. KOERNER:

Let's take the

The parent in this case can

21

never get reimbursed because they don't meet the

predicate which is that their child had to previously -

is no appropriate public education available; is that

not true?

MR. KOERNER:

Yes.

You mean assuming the

statute does not apply?
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but that is -- but the

parent would not have to show that the parent would have

used that available public remedy -

13

MR. KOERNER:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. KOERNER:

That's correct.
--

if it were there?

And Congress could have

16

concluded that the parent you're referring to who placed

17

that child immediately in a private school, and who may

18

not have an interest in obtaining a public school

19

education for that child, may not be as cooperative and

20

as collaborative as someone who has a child in the

21

system, to work out an individual education plan because

22

of some of these -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then the conclusion would

be that that parent hasn't met the heavy burden of

25

showing that there is no appropriate public education.

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. KOERNER:

But the problem is, if you go

2

to an impartial hearing officer as in this case, and you

3

have a child that's been in a private school for a

4

number of years and is doing very well, and the private

5

school special ed teacher comes in and highlights all

6

the successes of the kid, and then the New York City

7

Department of Education comes in with is profit plan

8

which is based on speculation, because the child has

9

never been in the system, is it so unreasonable for

10

Congress to conclude as a matter of statutory, explicit

11

language that the child should go into the system so

12

that at least with respect to your burden there's at

13

least a participatory program where they try to help the

14

child get an individual education.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

If Congress's purpose really

16

was what you -- what you suggest and what I think

17

Justice Scalia's question suggests, that there was a

18

desire to make parents who really had no interest in the

19

public school system give the public schools a chance,

20

why is it that, even as you read the statute, there's no

21

requirement that the child remain in the public school

22

system for any significant period of time?

23

pro forma.

24
25

MR. KOERNER:

It's just

Indeed, Justice Alito.

Congress in this case got it completely right because
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not only did they put in the explicit language, they

2

also put in a time period because they understood that

3

this Court had ruled in a number of cases that its upset

4

was with the protracted period that a family has to have

5

a child in the system.

6

and by thereby ensuring a parent that by giving notice

7

and specifically articulating the reason why the plan is

8

deficient and giving the school district an opportunity

9

to cure the problem, everybody would understand 10 days

But by having a notice provision

10

later that they can leave.

11

highlighted in Burlington and Carter is no longer a

12

problem under the explicit legislation.

13

So the very problem that you

individual determination.

your notice as was raised in a hypothetical, that would

go to whether or not there was the duty to cooperate

which was fulfilled, which also is a requirement for

All the statute says is come

What happens after that, if you give

Alderson Reporting Company

this particular section for reimbursement.

2

It's not just that you are in a program and

3

private school is providing appropriate service and then

4

you have an IEP that may not provide the free

5

appropriate public education, but you also have to show

6

you cooperated with the program because the whole

7

primary purpose of the program is to provide a public

8

education.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, to be fair, this

10

provision doesn't just apply to the rich person who

11

wants New York City to pay 30,000 of his tuition to a

12

private school.

13

already in public school, and the program offered by the

14

-- by the city is patently inadequate.

compelling the parent nonethe less to put the kid in a

needs.

It also applies to somebody who is

You are

That is correct, but your -

19

first of all, Congress could weigh the balance between

20

that particular problem and the need to give the school

21

district an opportunity to try to provide a program, but

22

it does run contrary to this Court's discussion in

23

Schaffer which presumes that the school district is

24

going try to accommodate the child, try to provide the

25

needs of the child.
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

In effect, I think all of these questions

2

are based on the assumption that the plan is going to be

3

automatically deficient.

4

foundation this Court has indicated there's no

5

foundation.

6

parent has the ultimate burden of persuasion because it

7

presumed that the plan -- if you accept that principle,

8

which has already been articulated and you accept the

9

fact that specialists on the Board of Education have -

I don't believe there's any

That's why it said in Schaffer that the

10

are going to try to adjust to this kid's needs, then

11

having the kid in the system even for a short while is

12

something that Congress could determine.

13

that's what the language says.

14

And indeed

Now, we recognize that there is an absurd

15

argument, but it was difficult for us to understand how

16

it would be absurd to require this when indeed it would

17

solve the problems of Burlington and Carter because it

18

makes sure that if a parent doesn't want to stay for a

19

protracted period, it doesn't have to stay and then they

20

can litigate later.

21

as little as 10 days.

22

As Judge Alito noted, it would be

I mean some arguments -- some of the

23

arguments I should at least mention that the other side

24

has made:

25

argument was that there was an ambiguity because the

The chief -- in the Second Circuit, the

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

word "only"0 wasn't used.

So if I may use the example

2

that an individual may be eligible for welfare

3

recipients -- welfare benefits if that individual

4

previously received food stamps, the argument would be,

5

well, that's a little ambiguous because you didn't say

6

"only received food stamps."

7

doesn't have to have "only" and it probably undermines a

8

lot of statutes that Congress has passed. The language

9

is very, very clear.

Of course, the condition

10

The second argument that is made both by the

11

Solicitor General and Respondent is that there's been an

12

-- implied repeals of this Court's decisions in

13

MR. KOERNER:

No.

But it was a holding

where the student was in fact receiving special

education.

one where the -- now, a more interesting question would

5

have been raised if you had (iii) and not (ii).

6

only had the notice provision where Congress

7

contemplates you have to be in the system to give

8

notice, and I came to this Court and I said, under

(iii), Congress has really contemplated you have to at

The next case, of course, would have been

said, and this Court would have to then consider whether

14

of an ambiguity in its (inaudible) decisions or whether

15

or not (iii) could be enforced without referring to (ii)

because why do you give notice?

17

Think about the result in this case.

You

For

someone in the system, they have to give notice and an

opportunity to cure, and the IEP can be modified.

So it would be a heavier burden

MR. KOERNER: But that would -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- if they did -

MR. KOERNER:

But that would be an

individual determination, Chief Judge.

No, my suggestion is

still that it would be easier to prevail at the

impartial hearing, if you can say, look, we tried, it

3

didn't work, as opposed to saying, we never even tried.

4

MR. KOERNER: Except for -

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If I were the

impartial hearing examiner, I would think that that's a

harder burden for the parents to carry if they didn't

even try.

what we would have done if you'd given us a chance and

10
11

The school's going to come in and say, here's

you didn't give us a chance.
MR. KOERNER:

But there is a dynamic at

12

these hearings that, if you come in and that you're in a

13

private school and you show that your child is doing

14

well in the private school, and we come in with a

15

theoretical plan that has never been implemented, there

16

is going to be a dynamic with the impartial hearing

officer who will tilt towards keeping the child -

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What is the basis for

19

saying that, when the one thing that the statute is very

20

clear on is that the starting premise of any

21

reimbursement claim is that an appropriate public

22

education is not available?

23

testing that wouldn't concentrate on what the private

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is the technical
I'm talking more about -

The parent would presumably

cover themselves, look it, he's getting X,Y -- X, Y, and

12

Z in the private school and you're going to give him Z;

Z is not going to be enough.

would be upon you to say, oh, we think Z is enough.

MR. KOERNER:

That's correct.

But, of

course, what we're saying has no actual practice.
But all this is separate and distinct from

And unless that language is

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about an exception if,

22

in fact, the school district admits that they can't do

anything for this child?

1412(a)(10)(B), where the school district does not

to a private school and will give reimbursement because

4

that will be the equivalent of the free appropriate

5

6

there has not yet been -- where the school believes they

7

can provide it.

8
9

We are just talking about cases where

The parent and the child disagree.

Now, there are two other arguments that I
want to address.

One, recognizing that the language

10

seems to support the petitioner's position.

11

that, in fact, they did get special education and

12

related services because for the years 1997 and 1998 and

13

1998-1999, we settled with them and we did pay the

14

tuition.

15

specifically provided that the settlement was not to

16

create any admission for future applications.

17

They argue

But Paragraph 17 of each of those agreements

And as this Court is aware, both under the

The second argument they make is, well, we

5

But an IEP which

You have to be in the system receiving

And indeed, in Section 1414 of U.S.C., it

MR. GARDEPHE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

When a child with a learning disability has

19

been denied a free and appropriate public education,

private school tuition reimbursement, whether or not the

child previously receives special education related

If the parents of a child with a disability who

previously received special education and related

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I mean if you say that our prior cases

2

overrode that limitation, then what purpose does the

3

limitation serve?

4

MR. GARDEPHE:

Your Honor, the first

5

question is whether that is intended to be exclusive.

6

And I don't think it was, because the "only if" language

7

is not there.

8

used in IDEA in multiple places.

9

to say only if it intended, if it intended -

10

And the "only if" language is actually

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And Congress knew how

Where else does it say that

11

the city will pay for the cost of a private education

12

except there?

13

part of the requirements for getting it is that the

14

child was receiving service at a public institution.

15

That's the only place it says it.

MR. GARDEPHE:

Your Honor, Congress did not

16

intend that exclusive language.

17

have used the "only if" language.

18

And

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If it had, it would

Then why didn't Congress

19

adequately give the equivalent of what you call the

20

"only if" language when it began (iii) by saying the

21

cost of reimbursement described in clause two?

22

reimbursement described in clause two is described in

23

terms of the clause that Justice Scalia is zeroing in

24

on.

25

MR. GARDEPHE:

The

Because, Your Honor, the
27

context is public school.

2

Congress was seeking to address, and that's why you

have -

That is the situation that

I'm sorry.

I'm just not

Can you rephrase that?

MR. GARDEPHE:

Yes.

If you look at

7

(C)(iii), Your Honor, it obviously repeatedly refers to

8

prior to the removal of a child from the public school.

9

So Congress was clearly focused on and it was intending

10

to give guidance to the courts in their equitable -- in

11

exercising their equitable powers.

12

a child who was in public school, these are the types of

13

notice and cooperation things the court should take into

14

consideration.

15

So in the context of

The question, Your Honor, is whether they

16

intended this to be the exclusive vehicle by which

17

tuition reimbursement could be obtained?

18

to that, Your Honor, is no.

19

answer is no is because there is no "only if" language.

20

And the answer

And the reason why the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

hypothesize two statutes:

MR. GARDEPHE:

One, the statute before the

purpose?

4

purpose.

5

what comes in (C)(iii).

And my answer to that, the language in

6

The other thing I would like to say -

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't understand.

8

You read "who previously received special education

9

services," and you say that includes who previously did

10
11

not receive special education services.
MR. GARDEPHE:

No.

What I'm saying is that

12

that provides the context for what follows in (C)(iii).

13

The context it provides is -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There would be no

15

reason for Congress to put that language in if the same

16

right to reimbursement existed if the child had not

17

previously received special education services.

18

MR. GARDEPHE:

No, Your Honor.

The point of

19

that language is to provide the backdrop for (C)(iii)

20

where Congress did intend to give guidance to courts in

21

the exercise of the equitable -

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Because your friend

23

reads that the exact opposite way and says, since

24

(C)(iii) only makes sense if the child is in the public

25

school, that that's a limitation on how you should read

(C)(ii).

2

MR. GARDEPHE:

down to if Congress intends to address the full -

5

But the question is whether -- it really boils

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In that case, isn't

6

it pertinent that the title to (C)(ii) says

7

"Reimbursement for Private School Placement"?

8

doesn't say reimbursement for private school placement

9

when the child previously attended public school.

10
11
12

MR. GARDEPHE:
not exhaustive.

It

But, Your Honor, (C)(ii) is

I'm sure this Court would agree that the

13

the private placement has to be appropriate is the law

16

(C)(ii) does not set forth that

requirement.

And what that says to me is that (C)(ii)

18

was never intended by Congress to be exhaustive.

19

And (C)(ii) doesn't set forth that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That just means that

20

(C)(ii) doesn't address the entire universe of issues

21

that might arise.

22

address exactly what its title says, "Reimbursement for

23

Private School Placement."

24
25

But that doesn't mean that it doesn't

MR. GARDEPHE:

Your Honor, I believe it's

probative on the issue of whether Congress intended

(C)(ii) to set forth the requirements for private school

2

tuition reimbursement and all the factual context in

3

which that could be rendered.

4

I do want to address one point, which is

5

that did Congress deal with this issue later?

That is

6

to say, in terms of the notice factors that it set forth

7

in (C)(iii), which I have argued to you applied to

8

parents whose children have been in public school.

9

answer to that question, Your Honor, is, yes, they did.

The

10

They addressed it in 1415(f)(1)(B), which require the

11

2004 amendments to IDEA.

12
13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Where is that set

forth?

14

MR. GARDEPHE:

1415(f)(1)(B) -- I'm sorry,

15

Your Honor, it's not in the appendix to the solicitor

16

17

that provision requires is that parents, prior to a due

process hearing, must meet with the IEP team, they must

meet with the school district, they must lay out their

complaints about the IEP, and the statute provides give

MR. GARDEPHE:

These were 2004 amendments,

Your Honor.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You haven't identified the

8

statutory provision that you think provides the

9

authority for the payment in this case.

10

MR. GARDEPHE:

Your Honor, I believe it

11

begins with 1400(d)(1)(A) and 1412(A)(1); both of which

12

impose the requirement on school districts to make

13

available the free and appropriate public education for

14

the child.

15

continues to 1415 (i)(2)(C)(3), which is the provision

16

that grants courts to -- sorry, grants such relief as

17

the court determines is appropriate.

18

evidence either in the 1997 amendments or in its

19

legislative history that there was an intent to appeal

20

or override that remedy.

21

I believe it begins there.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It then

There is no

I suppose it's how

22

broadly you read legislative history.

23

was a statement by Representative Castle that this would

24

limit the payments that school districts had to make.

25

MR. GARDEPHE:

I thought there

Yes, Your Honor, and I think
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

with respect to the children in the public school

2

system, if you read (C)(3) -- and again these are

3

permissive -- but if (C)(3) is applied, then I think

4

Representative Castle's comments make perfect sense

5

because they provide for certain notice obligations.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So when it comes to

7

reimbursement of tuition, the parents who never place

8

their child in the public school are in better shape

9

than the parent who place their child in public school

10
11

and then want to remove him.
MR. GARDEPHE:

No, Your Honor.

And the

12

reason for that is, there was case law preceding the

13

1997 amendments that imposed reasonableness

14

reasonableness and cooperation requirements on parents

15

even before the 1997 amendments came into effect.

16

did mention, after 2004 those requirements were now

17

statutory, but the reality is as a matter of case law,

18

it was already very clear in 1997 that if you didn't

19

give notice to the school district, if you didn't

20

cooperate in the formation of an IEP, you were not going

21

to get tuition reimbursement.

22

directly from, in particular, Carter's statement that

23

the reimbursement remedy is subject to equitable

24

considerations.

25

As I

And of course that flows

So it has always been the law that if a
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

parent does not cooperate, does not give notice, does

2

not cooperate in the formation of an IEP, that they will

3

not get -- or that the court has the discretion to deny

4

the tuition reimbursement remedy.

5
6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But cooperation does

not require sending the child to the public school.

7

MR. GARDEPHE:

No, Your Honor.

I think it's

8

clear that Congress never intended, to quote Justice

9

Scalia, that parents would be required to place their

10

child in a patently inappropriate placement in order to

11

qualify for tuition reimbursement, and to address

12

Justice Alito's point, Your Honor, we don't know -

13

whether it's 10 days or 11 days or 1 day -- we don't

14

know.

15

ten- day requirement in (C)(3), but that's by no means

16

clear.

18

find the placement inappropriate.

We can draw some guidance, I suppose, from the

The parents can give notice ten days before the

So this -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well in my case they

20

would note have received any benefits, under the terms

21

of the statute.

22

MR. GARDEPHE:

But Your Honor, it highlights

23

that if they can place the child in for one day, this is

24

an utterly meaningless provision that Congress never

25

could have intended to require because it serves no

Alderson Reporting Company

purpose.

2

And that's CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's why your

3

friend says it serves the purpose of helping to make

4

clear that the public school is -- whether it is or is

5

not able to provide the appropriate public education.

6

mean, why would Congress have put the phrase in there -

7

even if it was describing as you say the most common

8

situation -- why would it put the phrase in there if it

9

doesn't serve that purpose at least?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What you're saying

18

is it's not a very significant hurdle, but it is going

19

to be a hurdle in some cases.

20

MR. GARDEPHE:

It doesn't serve any useful

21

purpose, Your Honor, and if it doesn't serve any useful

22

purpose there is no reason to believe that Congress

23

intended it to have that effect.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The useful purpose

it serves is allow the school district to show what it
35
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

can do in ten days, as opposed to a mere theoretical

2

statement, it allows some actual concrete practice to

3

see if the plan that the public school has developed is

4

going to work or not going to work, that the impartial

5

hearing examiner can evaluate in a more concrete

6

setting.

7

MR. GARDEPHE:

This Court has addressed that

8

balance in Burlington, and the answer was no, the

9

statute does not require that parents place their child

10
11

in an inappropriate place.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But then the whole

12

point is the statute was then amended after Burlington.

13

So to say what Burlington interpreted, it don't seem to

14

me to be very compelling on the question of what the

15

amended statute provided.

16

MR. GARDEPHE:

But again, Your Honor, there

17

is no evidence in that amendment that it was intended to

be exclusive or intended to be exhaustive of the

19

circumstances and factual context.

Let me go back You don't have to read it

that way, anyway.
MR. GARDEPHE:

Let me address that, Your Honor.

What that would mean, then, I suppose, is that parents

10

would be required each year to put their child in a

11

public school for some period of time to qualify, and

12

then place their kid in private school if they didn't -

and then you're talking about a disruption -

Once you're in the private

17

Anyway, that issue is not -- not before us today.

18

I don't understand you assertion that

19

somehow this would amount to repeal by implication.

The

20

provision of 1415 -- what is it, (b), (b)(3) -- it seems

21

to me is just like a provision for, for a court's

22

exercise of its equitable powers.

court had granted some equitable relief in one case, and

25

then there is a statute that's passed which renders that

that that -- that that amounts to a repeal by

upon the remainder of the statue, and as it exists at

5

the time that the relief is sought.

6

It's just that what is appropriate depends

MR. GARDEPHE:

The point we are trying to

7

make, Your Honor, is that in light of Burlington, which

8

obviously Congress had knowledge of when it enacted the

9

1997 amendments, is it credible to believe that they

10

would have restricted, limited, overruled the holding of

11

Burlington, and never said a word about it?

Situation (a) is that the school district thinks they

flows from Burlington, where the Congress was aware that

this Court -

But my question was what

about (b)?

My question was not to argue with you.

question was, why doesn't (b) take care of the examples

MR. GARDEPHE:

In a perfect world, Your

2

Honor, school districts who are confronted with a

3

situation would always make the decision to place the

4

child in private schools at public expense, but

5

unfortunately there are disagreements between school

6

districts and parents about what is appropriate, and

7

then sometimes school districts don't do what they are

8

supposed to do under the statute and in fact the city's

9

interpretation here would incentivize school districts

10

not to provide services because if they never provided

11

services they wouldn't be liable for the reimbursement.

12

Again, this can't be what Congress intended.

I did want to back up my assertion about the

JUSTICE BREYER:

(b), that's my question,

(b).

17

Then I suddenly hear no, that don't worry about it,

18

judge, is what I heard, because in the situation where

19

the school district has not provided there is another

20

section of the statute that takes care of the child.

21

That's what I want to hear your response to.

22

I thought you were right.

MR. GARDEPHE:

Until I heard that.

Your Honor, that relies on

the good faith of the school district.

may be -- there may be a disagreement about whether they

That's not always going to happen.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You have review

bad faith, correct?

MR. GARDEPHE:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

before the Hearing Examiner that alleged bad faith on

11

the part of the school district.

12

MR. GARDEPHE:

Yes, Your Honor.

Obviously,

13

the parents contend both that the plan was not

14

appropriate, and that it wasn't offered in good faith.

15

But I -- I did want to back up my assertion on the "only

16

if" language and -- and recite some statutory

17

references.

18

from the statute when you go through the provisions.

19

Because I believe it stems very clearly

"Only if" or "only" are used in many, many

places 1415(f) (3)(E )(ii), 1414(a)(1)(C)ii,

21

1411(b)(1)(A ), 1401(19)(C), 1415(k)(4)(C) in the '98

22

version of the statute, 1413 -

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

MR. GARDEPHE:

25

Bingo. You got me on that.
The point is, Your Honor,

that Congress knew how to say "only if."
41

They didn't do

that here, because they had no intention of creating an

And this Court said in Winkelman that courts

4

implicit limitation, and this limitation goes to what

6

the Court also said in Winkelman is the primary mandate.

Finally, Your Honors, when Congress here

in a very, very direct way.

But there is no other place that

10

Congress carved out populations of children other than

that Congress intended in a backdoor fashion to carve

SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

2
3

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

4

Petitioner takes the position that a school

5

district may both refuse to provide a child with a

6

disability with an appropriate public placement and

7

refuse to pay for an appropriate private placement.

8
9

This Court has twice before considered and
twice before unanimously rejected -

10
11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, he hasn't -- he hasn't

said that.
MR. GARRE:

I think he does in the sense,

13

Your Honor, Justice Scalia, that the -- the school

14

district can take the position, even if the IET that is

15

proposed is inadequate and it's adjudicated to be

16

inadequate, because the Schaffer presumption that was

17

brought up earlier does not apply in this case.

18

we are talking about situations where a parent can prove

19

that the placement was inadequate.

20

the parent cannot qualify for reimbursement unless it

21

subjects his child

22

In that situation

to the inappropriate placement.

This Court rejected that rationale in clear

23

and unambiguous terms in the Burlington case.

24

Rehnquist put it in that case -

MR. GARRE:

The -- the part of the

11

Burlington case I'm referring to Justice Scalia is the

12

interpretation of the fundamental requirement of

13

providing free and appropriate public education.

14

what Justice Rehnquist said there -- and the unanimous

15

Court agreed -- is forcing a parent to choose between

16

subjecting his child to inadequate public placement or

17

paying for private placement deprives the parent of his

18

right to a free and appropriate public education.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

So does the

20

10-business-days notice requirement for people who are

21

in public schools also violate Burlington, because for

22

10 business days they are going to be subject to an

23

inappropriate education?

24
25

MR. GARRE:

The way the 10-business-days

requirement works in practice is that all of the IEPs 45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

virtually all of them are proposed towards the end of

2

the school year; and, typically, the parent is submitted

3

the proposed IEP during the summer.

4

point that they have to make a decision whether to

5

litigate that, put their child in a private school, or

6

put them into a public school.

7

And it's at that

So the 10 business days in practice is not

8

going to require the child to go into the inadequate

9

placement.

10

That was true in the fact pattern CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So in a situation

11

where it's not in the summer, where they say, well,

12

let's see how it works, and then they go to the public

13

school, I would have thought your argument also would

14

say it's not -- they don't have to give notice of 10

15

business days because in Burlington you said you don't

16

-- you have to make available the tuition reimbursement.

17

They passed a statute imposing a limitation on that, 10

18

business days.

MR. GARRE:

And we don't -- we don't dispute

that CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Congress in the legislative history indicates that they

were focused on case law applying this Court's decision

in Burlington and Carter where the students were already

enrolled in public school.

9

There is no indication whatsoever at all in

10

the legislative record that anybody had in mind scaling

11

back the fundamental mandate of the statute for school

12

districts to provide a free and appropriate public

13

education for every child.

Anywhere?

I thought

easing the burden on the school districts to pay

So how would a

During the period between

22

Burlington and the enactment of this statute, would you

23

have any doubt about your potential obligation to

24

reimburse a parent -- during the period of Burlington

25

and the enactment of the statute, would the school board
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have had doubt about its potential liability for

2

reimbursement, in a situation like this?

3

MR. KOERNER:

I think so.

I think, because

4

of Burlington and Carter, where the children were

5

already in the system, this would be the next step.

6

Would we have presented to you the fact that you

7

shouldn't expand it?

8

would conclude?

9

entire discussion.

Probably.

Would I know what you

No, but the statute eliminated that
It is clear.

But again, there is a

10

very big spending clause -- as I mentioned in my earlier

11

presentation, if it's so ambiguous that you can read out

12

a specific provision, how can that ambiguity not go down

13

to the benefit of the city through it's local education

14

system?

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought this statute

16

was also premised on Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, in

17

which case it wouldn't have spending clause notice

18

argument.

19

MR. KOERNER:

No, the -- this is just a

20

grant provision, Your Honor.

It's not premised on any

21

constitutional provision.

22

provided to the local education district, and in return

23

they agree to comply with all the conditions set forth

24

in the IDEA.

25

you very much.

It's a grant where funds are

There are no constitutional limits.
