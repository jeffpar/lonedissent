ORAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY GROSSMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. GROSSMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The text of section 10(b) as well as the

12

rule 10b-5 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange

13

Commission prohibit the use of any deceptive device by

14

any person, indirectly or indirectly, in connection with

15

the purchase or sale of a security.

16

deceptive devices used by the Respondents in this case

17

is conduct that is squarely covered by the text of the

18

statute and by the rule.

19

The various

Respondents here were not passive bystanders

20

facilitating a fraud by Charter.

21

conduct was integral to the scheme to create fictitious

22

advertising revenues for Charter to report to investors.

23

Their deceptive

Respondents agreed to overcharge Charter so

24

that they could receive the money from Charter to then

25

return to it for the advertising, using Charter's very

4

1

same money for the purchase of the advertising.

2

Respondent Scientific-Atlanta created a document

3

falsely claiming that the reason for the increased

4

payments from Charter were because of increased

5

manufacturing expenses.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

The transaction was not

7

wholly without benefit to Scientific-Atlanta.

8

some advertising.

9

to Charter.

They got

And it was not wholly without benefit

They were able to show that advertising

10

works.

Now, that puts aside the fact that they were

11

using misleading accounting principles.
MR. GROSSMAN:

12

Well, I would agree, Your

13

Honor, that they received free advertising.

14

problem was that they were creating the illusion that it

15

wasn't free advertising, but rather that they were

16

purchasing the advertising.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17
18

21

And was the price four to

five times higher than the normal rates for advertising?
MR. GROSSMAN:

19
20

But the

That is correct, Justice

Ginsburg.
And the obvious purpose for creating the

22

illusion that they were purchasing the advertising

23

rather than receiving free advertising was so that

24

Charter can incorporate these increased revenues in

25

their financial statements.

And Respondents understood,

5

1

they understood that in order to -- for Charter to pass

2

this by their accountants, to deceive the accountants --

3

and this is reflected in the indictment -- in order to

4

deceive the accountants for Charter, the Respondents

5

were told that there had to be separate agreements for

6

both the advertising agreements and the purchase

7

agreements.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

8
9

Mr. Grossman, is there any

reason why, in principle, the elements for a cause of

10

action under 10b-5 have to be the same as the elements

11

for a cause of action by the agency under 10(b)?

12

we, we created this, this cause of action.

13

forth in the statute, although other private causes of

14

action are.

I mean,

It's not set

15

If it's our creation, couldn't we sensibly

16

limit it so that, for example, schemes can be attacked

17

by the SEC, but schemes do not form the basis for

18

private attorney general's actions?

19

conveyance of a misrepresentation to the injured party.

20

Is there any reason why we couldn't do that?

21

MR. GROSSMAN:

You need actual

Well, I think there are two

22

reasons, Your Honor.

The first is that at this point in

23

time -- I think as the Court recognized in Dura fairly

24

recently -- that when Congress enacted the Private

25

Security Law Reform Act, that at that time they accepted

6

1

the private right of action that this Court had

2

previously inferred.

3

inferred the private right of action not only for the

4

section but each of the rules in Section 10(b).

5

And this Court had previously

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it's not like

6

under the Sherman Act, where we have reason to think

7

Congress intended the Court to go about the business of

8

construing and developing antitrust law.

9

have kind of taken over for us.

In fact, they

They are imposing

10

certain limits on when actions can be brought, proposing

11

particular specific elements.

12

20(e), specifying the SEC can bring an action but

13

private investors can't.

14

In one of the provisions,

I mean, we don't get in this business of

15

implying private rights of action any more.

16

the effort by Congress to legislate a good signal that

17

they have kind of picked up the ball and they are

18

running with it and we shouldn't?

19

MR. GROSSMAN:

And isn't

Well, this Court, Your Honor,

20

as recently as 2002 in Wharf (Holdings) said there is a

21

private right of action for violation of any of the

22

subdivisions of rule 10b-5:

23

have to be reversed.

24
25

a, b, or c.

That would

Going back to the Superintendent of
Insurance case in, in -- that would be in 1971, Your

7

1

Honor, the Court held there was a private right of

2

action for violation of --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

my point.

5

haven't done it for quite sometime.

6

Well, that's kind of

We did that sort of thing in 1971.

MR. GROSSMAN:

We

But when Congress enacted

7

the Private Security Law Reform Act, everything it did

8

in connection with that statute was directed to the

9

private right of action that this Court had previously

10

implied under 10(b).

11

intended in any way --

12

Nothing that Congress did was

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm not -- my

13

suggestion is not that we should go back and say that

14

there is no private right of action.

15

that we should get out of the business of expanding it,

16

because Congress has taken over and is legislating in

17

the area in a way they weren't back when we implied

18

the right of action under 10(b).

19

MR. GROSSMAN:

My suggestion is

Well, I would agree,

20

Congress has taken it over.

And when they enacted the

21

Private Security Law Reform Act, they recognized this

22

private right of action.

23

the private right of action.

24

would be multiple primary violators of 10(b).

25

that in connection with proportionate liability

Everything they did recognized
It recognized that there
It did

8

1

provisions.

2

players.

3

It recognized that there would be multiple

So certainly, Congress had an understanding

4

of what this Court had done up until that time.

5

this Court up until that time had implied the private

6

right of action for every subset of rule 10b-5.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

And

Is it -- is it a

8

necessary part of your theory that the deceptive

9

practice that Scientific-Atlanta went in, that they

10

knew that that was also -- that Charter would carry that

11

forward?

12

to this deceptive practice to Scientific-Atlanta, that

13

it looked like it had more money to spend on advertising

14

than it really did, but they didn't care what Charter

15

did with it.

16

going to carry it on its books the way they did.

17

there still be liability for Scientific-Atlanta?

18

I mean, let's suppose that there were benefits

In fact, they didn't know that Charter was

MR. GROSSMAN:

No.

Would

No, not under the test

19

that we have proposed, which is very similar to the test

20

proposed by the Ninth Circuit or applied in the Ninth

21

Circuit in the Simpson case, and the test proposed by

22

the Securities and Exchange Commission in their amicus

23

brief submitted in the Simpson case.

24

to just to have the deceptive act.

25

scheme liability has to be with the purpose of

It's not enough
The deceptive act for

9

1

furthering a scheme to defraud investors.
So if Scientific-Atlanta or Motorola had

2
3

engaged in deceptive conduct, but that deceptive conduct

4

was not intended to further a scheme to defraud the

5

shareholders, no, Your Honor, there would be no action

6

under the theory that we are pursuing here.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

Intended or known?

I mean,

8

I don't see -- what's in it for Scientific-Atlanta to

9

defraud the shareholders?

10

Is it enough that they just

knew it would be used for that purpose?
MR. GROSSMAN:

11

Oh, it would be enough if

12

they committed a deceptive act and they knew it was in

13

furtherance of a scheme.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

Well, when you say "in

15

furtherance of," you -- you import intent.

16

care what Charter was going to do with it, but they

17

pretty well knew that what Charter was going to do was

18

to make its books look better.

19

Would that be enough?

20

MR. GROSSMAN:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's what I thought your

position was.
MR. GROSSMAN:

24
25

I think that would be

reckless.

22
23

They didn't

--

Yes, but my position is also

10

1
2

JUSTICE SCALIA:
necessarily.

3
4

So it's not an intent

It's just knowledge.
MR. GROSSMAN:

It certainly needs scienter.

You certainly need scienter.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

5

I mean, it's more than

6

knowledge.

I mean, you mentioned recklessness.

7

to have either knowledge of or a willingness to maintain

8

an indifference to the consequence.
MR. GROSSMAN:

9

It's got

Exactly right, Justice

10

Souter.

And I think it's important -- and there is a

11

very -- there is a very good discussion of this in the

12

Simpson case by the Ninth Circuit, that the purpose of

13

the test is such that it will not ensnare someone who

14

does engage in a deceptive act but doesn't understand

15

that the reason for it is to further a scheme.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

Sure.

After trial -- you

17

know, after trial which causes your stock to tank, you

18

may indeed be able to show that you didn't know it was

19

going to be used for that purpose.

20

this is all about, isn't it, getting it -- getting it by

21

the summary-judgment stage?
MR. GROSSMAN:

22

No.

I mean, that's what

I think, Your Honor,

23

that this Court answered this last term in the Tellabs

24

case.

25

in the PSLRA, the Private Security Law Reform Act, so

And Congress answered that question that you pose

11

1

that you cannot just bring a case and hope to get it by

2

the summary-judgment stage.

3

particularized facts alleged under the heightened

4

pleading standards of the PSLRA and this Court's

5

decision in Tellabs showing that not only the deceptive

6

act, but that the purpose of that deceptive act was to

7

further a scheme.

9

So, no, you can't just --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

You have to have

What facts -- what has to

be alleged short of -- on information and belief the

10

defendant knew that -- that this information would

11

appear on the balance sheets and be used to improve the

12

status of the stock?
MR. GROSSMAN:

13

Well, of course if you just

14

-- if you just allege it on information and belief,

15

you're out of court.

16

pass the heightened pleading standard in Tellabs or the

17

PSLRA.

18

have allegations -- and we didn't make these allegations

19

from whole cloth -- these allegations were derived

20

principally from a grand jury -- the Federal grand

21

jury indictment against Charter executives.

22

indictment says that Respondents were informed and

23

ordered to deceive Charter's accountants.

24

have --

25

No doubt about that.

That doesn't

What you do need is what we have here.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Here you

That

They had to

Why shouldn't we be

12

1

guided by what Congress did in reaction to the Central

2

Bank case?

3

liability, Congress amended the statute in 20(e) to say

4

yes, there is, but private plaintiffs can't sue on that

5

basis.

6

the private action under 10b-5?

There we said there's no aiding-and-abetting

Why shouldn't that inform how we further develop

MR. GROSSMAN:

7

Well, I think if Congress

8

intended under 20(e) -- certainly the private actions

9

similar to this -- it would have said that only the SEC

10

has the authority to bring a claim for substantial

11

assistance whether or not it involves deceptive conduct.

12

They could have very easily said "any deceptive conduct,"

13

and that would have barred these claims.

14

to do that.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They chose not

But they were --

16

they were addressing a very specific decision from this

17

Court, the Central Bank decision.

18

they did not do is say that that decision was wrong

19

with respect to private -- or going forward they weren't

20

going to overrule that decision with respect to private

21

rights of action.

22

I know you call it a primary violator, but not the

23

person who --

And the one thing

You're asking us to extend to non --

24

MR. GROSSMAN:

Secondary actors.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- who put the

13

1

deceptive conduct into the market.

2

extend that liability to them, which seems inconsistent

3

with Congress's approach in 20(e).
MR. GROSSMAN:

4

You're asking us to

We are not asking any

5

extension.

Quite the contrary, Your Honor.

6

that is the Respondents who are asking for a narrowing.

7

When Congress addressed the PSLRA it addressed all of

8

the arguments that we are hearing today from Respondents

9

and their amici.
JUSTICE ALITO:

10

I think

Is your theory dependent on

11

the proposition that Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola

12

deceived Arthur Andersen?

13

MR. GROSSMAN:

14

part of it.

16

Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:

15

That certainly is a large

But didn't you allege

exactly the opposite in your complaint?
MR. GROSSMAN:

17

No.

We -- I think what

18

you're referring to is that -- is that the accountants

19

should have conducted a more diligent audit than they

20

did.

21

the auditors.

22

falsely stating a reason for a price increase?

23

I mean these people clearly were trying to deceive
Why else would you issue a document

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I'm looking at

24

paragraph 218 of your amended complaint, 109a of the

25

joint appendix, subsection 4.

It says, speaking of

14

1

Arthur Andersen, "though aware that Charter was seeking

2

to boost its revenues by paying vendors higher prices at

3

the same time it received additional advertising from

4

the same vendors, Andersen failed to properly audit

5

these transactions by confirming them with the vendors."

6

So you alleged that they weren't deceived.

7

that they knew exactly what was going on.

8
9

MR. GROSSMAN:

You alleged

No -- no, Your Honor, they

knew that they were paying the vendors higher prices,

10

but they didn't know why.

11

for the higher prices was followed by this misstatement

12

saying the reason for the higher prices is because of

13

increased manufacturing expenses, when in fact that

14

wasn't the reason.

15

The contract -- the contract

The reason was to take money --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Who told -- who told

16

Charter that it was necessary for them to have a time

17

spread between the contract -- the $20 above the

18

contract price and the advertising payment?

19

MR. GROSSMAN:

Arthur Andersen.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, if it told them

21

that, didn't it have -- it sounds to me from that that

22

the accountant says, look, if you want to make this

23

appear on the balance sheet as though the advertising

24

revenues were just ordinary advertising revenues, you

25

better separate these two.

That suggests that Arthur

15

1

Andersen knew all along what was going on.
MR. GROSSMAN:

2

No.

Justice Ginsburg, what

3

Arthur Andersen did not know -- and this is very clear.

4

They did not know that it was Charter's own money that

5

was being used by the Respondents to purchase the

6

advertising.

7

said, we are increasing the price on the set-top boxes

8

because of increased manufacturing expense.

9

false.

10

Charter was delivering the money to them.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that's exactly the

thing they told them to separate.
MR. GROSSMAN:

13
14

That was

The reason they were increasing it is because

11
12

They were deceived by that document that

Well, not for that reason,

Your Honor.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. GROSSMAN:

What other reason?
The reason is as follows.

17

This is what they refer to as barter contracts, two

18

companies exchanging things, which is perfectly

19

legitimate, there's nothing wrong with that.

20

are certain ways to account for it properly, and what

21

Arthur Andersen was telling Charter was in order to be

22

able to have revenues included, gross revenues, you have

23

to have unrelated -- unrelated contracts.

24

be a barter transaction.

25

that you could recognize the advertising revenues if

And there

They couldn't

But there is no way -- no way

16

1

you're using Charter's own money, and that's what Arthur

2

Andersen did not do.

3

Scalia, if Charter delivered a suitcase filled with cash

4

and gave it to them and said okay, buy the advertising

5

from us.

It would be no different, Justice

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

I understand what you're

7

saying.

It seems to me that when you say that they

8

can't be connected, you're saying precisely, you can't

9

be bartering the advertising revenue for the increased

10

money that you're paying.

11

MR. GROSSMAN:

No.

You can barter.

You can

12

barter, it's just a question of how you account for it.

13

But the bartering is one thing.

14

accounting principle relating to bartering, but there is

15

no accounting principle that permits the recording of

16

revenue if you're using the money from the seller.

17

that's why they disguised --

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, that's one

And

All right, just -- just to

19

be clear on this -- if Charter and Arthur Andersen and

20

Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola all sat down and cooked

21

up this scheme together and they all knew exactly what

22

was going on, would you have a claim against the

23

Respondents here?

24
25

MR. GROSSMAN:

Yes.

And the reason for

that, Your Honor, is because the advertising contract

17

1

was a sham, and the advertising contract was a sham

2

because Charter was giving the Respondents the money to

3

buy the advertising.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Then I see absolutely no

5

difference between your test and the elements of aiding

6

and abetting.

7
8
9

MR. GROSSMAN:

The difference is here we

would have conceptual -JUSTICE ALITO:

Because you just said that

10

it's not necessary for there to be an actual deceptive

11

act on the part of the Respondents.

12

MR. GROSSMAN:

There has to be a deception

13

-- there is deception.

14

into an advertising contract that presents the illusion

15

that you were purchasing advertising, when in fact you

16

were not purchasing the advertising.

17

The deception is you're entering

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's -- but

18

that's not the fraud that was imposed upon the market.

19

The fraud that was imposed on the market was Charter's

20

accounting for the transaction on its books.

21

bought or sold stock in reliance upon the way that

22

Scientific-Atlanta and Charter structured their deal.

23

They did so in reliance on the way that Charter

24

communicated its accounting to the marketplace.

25

MR. GROSSMAN:

Nobody

There was no way -- no way

18

1

that that could properly be accounted for, and the

2

Respondents understood that.

3

what they did, that's what --

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's why they did

But you're saying -But there are -- there are

6

any number of kickbacks and mismanagement and petty

7

frauds that go on in the business, and business people

8

know that any publicly held company's shares are going

9

to be affected by its profits, so I see no limitation to

10
11

your -- to your proposal for liability.
MR. GROSSMAN:

Well, I think the limitations

12

are as follows, Your Honor.

13

the purpose of furthering a scheme to defraud

14

shareholders.

15

materiality, that it cannot be --

16

Number one, there has to be

Number two, the test has an element of

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I agree with Justice

17

Scalia's earlier comment, I don't think that

18

Scientific-Atlanta and Motorola really cared anything of

19

-- one way or the other about the investors.

20
21
22
23
24
25

MR. GROSSMAN:

Well, that may be that they

didn't care about the investors -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

For them the scheme made a

certain amount of sense, they didn't really care.
MR. GROSSMAN:

Well, they may not have cared,

but that would be reckless because they certainly

19

1

understood -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2
3

from having a purpose.

4

purpose.

You said they have to have a

MR. GROSSMAN:

5

But that's far different

That's correct.

If you just

6

close your eyes -- if somebody comes to you and says,

7

look, we want you to enter into this transaction, it's a

8

phony transaction and we don't care -- do whatever you

9

want with that, and they know it's a publicly held

10

corporation and they have every reason to understand

11

that this information -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

Which goes back to my

13

earlier question, that most people that engage in

14

frauds on business know that if it's a publicly held

15

corporation, it's going to hurt the price of the shares

16

or affect the price of the shares.
MR. GROSSMAN:

17

Well, they shouldn't engage

18

in schemes to defraud, that's what Congress intended by

19

section 10.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But as I understand your

21

argument, it is the difference between aiding and

22

abetting liability on the part of the Respondents and

23

liability as, in effect, as first line principles, is

24

their intent, or at the very least in knowledge that

25

they were committing a deceptive act as part of this

20

1

scheme.

Is that correct?
MR. GROSSMAN:

That's correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now, how many times are

parties of the position of Respondents ever going to

engage in those acts except with exactly the state of

mind that on your judgment makes them principals, rather

than aiders and abettors.

or intent that makes them, on your theory, principals

rather than aiders or abettors?

22

What I'm getting at is:

Are you

That, in reality, no one is going to do

MR. GROSSMAN:

No, there are cases, I think,

and there would not be the purpose to defraud

shareholders.

not a deceptive act in relation to somebody like the

MR. GROSSMAN:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Exactly.
But that's a different

answer, I think, from the one you were just giving

No.

perhaps mistakenly, from Justice Scalia that there

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. GROSSMAN:

Is that

No.

Not at all.

You cannot?
You, yourself -- you,

yourself, have to engage in the deceptive act.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. GROSSMAN:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.
Your own deceptive act.
Yes, but -- but if you do,

21

or if you should have known, you are not an aider and

22

abettor.

23

You are automatically a principal.
MR. GROSSMAN:

You may be a principal if you

24

satisfy the other elements of our test, which are

25

serious elements that you have to plead with

23

1

particularity, with the heightened pleading standards,

2

that they have the purpose to further a scheme to

3

defraud.

That's very different -JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

Is it fair to say that all

5

aiders and abettors who commit deceptive acts are

6

principals?

7

MR. GROSSMAN:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

No.
What's the difference?

What separates the two?
MR. GROSSMAN:

There are tests.

You have

11

to take it the next step further, because whether or

not that deceptive act had the purpose and effect of

furthering a scheme on investors.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Don't you need that to be

MR. GROSSMAN:

An aider or abettor?

You

have to have -JUSTICE SCALIA:

If I'm entirely innocent,

and I don't -MR. GROSSMAN:

An aider -- certainly --

21

certainly, the primary violator in the situation that we

22

are discussing where there are deceptive acts is aiding

23

and abetting.

24
25

I mean, if an accountant comes in and
deliberately falsifies a financial statement, he is

24

1

giving substantial assistance to the company's statement

2

-- the company who is issuing those false statements.

3

He would be an aider and abettor in that sense.

4

also a primary -JUSTICE SCALIA:

He is

You see, I really thought

6

the difference was that the principal is the one who

makes the deceptive representation and obtains money

from it.

facilitates or enables that deceptive representation,

10

The aider and abettor is the person who

which is what we have here.

11

MR. GROSSMAN:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.
And you say if you

13

facilitate knowingly and intentionally or even grossly

14

negligently, you are not an aider and abettor, but

15

you're a principal.

16

the line between the two.

17

MR. GROSSMAN:

I really don't understand what's

If you facilitate with a

18

deceptive act, then you're a primary violator.

19

what section 10(b) prohibits.

20

a deceptive act, then you are an aider and abettor.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's

If you facilitate without

Mr. Grossman, before you

22

finish, there is one statement made by the other side

23

that you are trying to use this -- small in comparison

24

to all the fraud that was involved here in order to

25

collect on the entire loss.

That is, you are asserting

25

1

that the vendors are liable for the entire loss when

2

they were just a bit player.

3

MR. GROSSMAN:

Yes.

We are not seeking that

4

at all, Your Honor.

5

liability provisions govern this with respect to -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So what are you seeking?

How would you measure your damages?
MR. GROSSMAN:

9

We -- the PSLRA proportionate

We would measure the damages,

number one, that flow from this particular scheme.

We

10

would have to first subtract the settlements that have

11

been achieved already, and then the proportionate

12

liability provisions of the PSLRA provide how you make

13

this determination.
You look at the particular nature of their

14

conduct, and you look at the extent to which their

16

particular conduct had a causal relationship with the

17

damages.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

Mr. Grossman, I'm

19

conscious of eating into your time but a question -- how

20

many chains of this connection can you have?

21

Charter was not a publicly traded company, but same

22

thing happened with respect to Scientific-Atlanta, and

23

that made it look valuable to a company that is publicly

traded.

made their profits look better to investors.

Can you --

how many chains in the link can you go?

so long as the person's deceptive conduct has the

purpose of furthering a scheme to defraud.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO.

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

14
15
16

MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Shapiro.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
My friend has just asked the Court to expand

17

an implied cause of action by diluting traditional

18

requirements such as the reliance requirement and by

19

eroding this Court's precedent in the Central Bank case.

20

The Court has said in the past that it must

21

be very cautious about expanding implied causes of

22

action, but here there are special reasons for caution.

23

Expanding the implied cause of action would give

24

plaintiff the very thing that Congress said it should

25

not get in section 20(e) of the Exchange Act.

27

1

Congress wanted cases like this one to be

2

handled by an expert and disinterested administrative

3

agency.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's if you equate this

5

with aiding-and-abetting, and I think the question is is

6

there a middle category between Charter, who is

7

clearly primarily liable, and Central Bank, that didn't

8

do anything deceptive?

9

MR. SHAPIRO:

The Central Bank case, I

10

believe, answers that by saying to be a primary violator

11

you have to satisfy all the prerequisites of 10(b)

12

liability, including reliance, loss causation, the

13

"in-connection-with" standard.

14

to meet these tests.

15

And here plaintiffs fail

And Congress in 20(e) --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you are saying -- I

16

thought your argument, unlike the government's argument,

17

is that there was no deceptive device.

18

deceptive device.

19

There was no

They simply aided and abetted.

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

That's one of the

20

arguments we make.

21

Central Bank because the defendant did not use or employ

22

deception in connection with a securities transaction.

23

That exactly describes what Charter did.

24
25

It is this case is governed by

Now, what exactly describes what the vendors
are alleged to do is what is said in 20(e) -- to

28

1

knowingly give substantial assistance to someone else

2

that is misleading an investor.

3

like a glove -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

That fits this case

Well, I thought -- I agree

5

with Justice Ginsburg.

I thought the "in-connection-with"

6

argument is actually in addition to or separate from an

7

additional argument you made that there was no deceptive

8

statement made here.

9

arguing, and I have problems with that argument because

I thought that's what you were

10

the statute doesn't require a statement.

11

-- conduct suffice.
MR. SHAPIRO:

12

It requires

We don't make these arguments

13

without reference to each other.

statutory terms have to be viewed together.

use deception in connection with securities trading,

16

17

did.

You have to

That's what Charter

And -JUSTICE SOUTER:

18
19

We think all of these

You don't defend the

position -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would you say that there

was deception, standing alone?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, we have -- we have

23

suggested that that is not true when you're speaking

24

with somebody that knows the facts such as Charter.

25

Charter understood all these facts.

Charter could have

29

1

accounted for these transactions correctly, itself.

2

vendors did that.

3

here.

4

transactions properly.

5

so it is the speaker here.

They didn't recognize any revenues

It was up to Charter to account for these
Congress required it to do that,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

The

But Charter said --

7

vendors, I need you to consummate this fraud on the

8

public.

9

those revenues that you're going to give me through

I can't do it without you.

I've got to have

10

these phony advertising payments at four or five times

11

the usual rate.

12

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, we believe even placing

13

that most pejorative characterization on these facts,

14

which we don't agree are the true facts, that still --

15
16
17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you must assume that

they are now.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Assuming that they are, that

18

this is a 20(e) situation where it is alleged that the

19

vendors gave substantial, knowing assistance to somebody

20

who was committing a fraud.

21

expert and disinterested administrative agency should

22

decide whether to proceed, because it is so slippery to

23

apply these characterizations.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And Congress said that an

That's if they are --

that's if they are aiders and if there are only two

30

1

categories and everyone who is not Charter is an aider

2

and abettor, then you're right.

3

category of people who, while not the benefited company

4

-- the company that's trying to achieve the deception --

5

but made it possible for that -- for that deception to

6

happen.

7

MR. SHAPIRO:

But if there's a middle

Well, you know that's an exact

8

description of Central Bank because there it was alleged

9

that the trustee entered --

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

MR. SHAPIRO:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

-- into a secret agreement.

MR. SHAPIRO:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

In Central Bank, it was

conceded that the bank engaged in no deceptive act.

14

16

No --

Well, the -Here there is the charge

that it did engage in deceptive acts.
MR. SHAPIRO:

What was conceded was that the

18

bank made no statement to investors, but what was

19

alleged in the complaint and argued in the briefs was

20

that the bank entered into a secret side agreement that

21

enabled the use of a fraudulent prospectus that

22

unleashed securities that were worthless on investors,

23

and investors said, we were depending on our trustee to

24

prevent that from happening.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now, I take it, though, you

31

1

do not defend the position that there must -- for 10(b)

2

liability -- that there must have been a statement

3

addressed to investors.
MR. SHAPIRO:

4

Well, we -- we think that for

5

reliance purposes, there --

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, do you --

-- the defendant has to

8

communicate with investors.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Would you answer my

10

question first?

11

be no 10(b) liability without a statement addressed to

12

investors?

13

Do you take the position that there can

MR. SHAPIRO:

It has to be communicated to

14

the investors and it has to be attributed under the case

15

law to the speaker.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You mean the statement as

17

such or a statement which could not have been made but

18

for the statements of the Respondents must be

19

communicated to the investors?

20

MR. SHAPIRO:

That -- that kind of but-for

21

causation is not sufficient.

22

That kind of --

23

Which one?

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That is not reliance.

So are you -- so you are

24

saying that there can be no causation and hence, you

25

know -- and I think you're going further.

You're saying

32

1

there can be no liability within the description of

2

10(b) unless there is a statement directly addressed to

3

the investors, is that correct?
MR. SHAPIRO:

4

That is one of our

5

submissions, but we also say that the substance of these

6

statements was never communicated to investors.

7

Charter -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8
9

Because the whole purpose

of it -MR. SHAPIRO:

10
11

Only

-- spoke to the investors and

never summarized these.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

MR. SHAPIRO:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Shapiro, if --

Yes?
If it was communicated to

15

investors that there had been $20 per set box over the

16

regular price, if there had been advertising that was

17

paid for by the very money that Charter gave, then the

18

whole thing would have failed.

19

the vendors are silent.

20

counts.

21

whole thing fails.

22

So this can work only if

Silence and not speech is what

If the vendors communicate anything at all, the

MR. SHAPIRO:

But the -- the communication,

23

Your Honor, has to be to the market and to investors.

24

There was no duty to disclose to investors here.

25

only communications the vendors made were "we're raising

The

33

1

our prices 6 percent, the date of our contract is August

2

31st, for the simple reason that it started the very

3

next day” --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

MR. SHAPIRO:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

-- on September 1st."
Was there any economic

substance to this?
MR. SHAPIRO:

8
9

Was there any --

Oh, of course.

There was

economic substance from the vendors' perspective.

They

10

were selling their products at exactly the price that

11

they wanted to receive for those products and they were

12

getting some free cooperative advertising thrown in at

13

the same time.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

Is it true that the price

15

that they were charging, they did not charge to other

16

customers -- the $20 hike?
MR. SHAPIRO:

17

Well, it's true because they

18

weren't concerned with that because they weren't paying

19

for it.

20

cooperative advertising, the reason being --

Charter was paying for this cooperative --

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

MR. SHAPIRO:

23
24
25

But it was --

-- that Charter had a big

interest.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- a sham then, because

they said the reason they upped the price $20 a box was

34

1

they -- the inflationary conditions, so they had to

2

renegotiate the contract, but didn't renegotiate with

3

any of their other customers.
MR. SHAPIRO:

4

Well, Your Honor, from the

5

vendors' perspective, this was a transaction that

6

appeared to be a way to increase cooperative

7

advertising.

8

told by Charter that Arthur Andersen had approved the

9

transaction.

It cost the vendors no money.

They were

That's alleged in the Barford indictment.

10

Then they went home and talked to their own auditors --

11

how do you account for this unusual transaction?

12

auditors said, you cannot record any revenues from the

13

transaction.

14

expected Charter to do the same thing, to not record

15

revenues --

They didn't record any revenues.

The

17

MR. SHAPIRO: -- if that's what the rules

required.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

allegation of the complaint.

21

allegation of the complaint was that they -- they

22

knew that this was a fraud and they participated in

23

the fraud.

24
25

MR. SHAPIRO:

-- that's not the
I -- I thought the

Yes, they -- they do allege.

I'm merely pointing out that in the Barford --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I mean that -- so that

2

your answer doesn't seem to be -- get us very far on a

3

legal point.
MR. SHAPIRO:

4

Well, we say that if you take

5

the complaint at face value and you don't even consider

6

the Barford indictment that they cite, that it still is

7

a classic example of knowingly giving substantial

8

assistance to someone else that is making misstatements

9

to investors, because these vendors didn't make any

10

misstatement to investors.

Nobody relied on their sales

11

correspondence.

12

after the stock had gone all the way up and come all the

13

way down.

It sat in a file drawer until long

That's the essence of the

statements, to swell its revenues -- revenues that it in

19

fact didn't have.

20

You said that they -- they are home free

But they set up Charter to make those

MR. SHAPIRO:

But Congress's policy judgment

21

here is that the SEC, an expert agency that is

22

impartial, should evaluate a claim of that sort and

23

decide whether to proceed.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's if they are aiders

and abettors, which is what Congress covered.

And I

36

1

again go back to, is there another category or is

2

everyone -- either Charter, the person whose stock is at

3

stake, the company whose stock is at stake and everyone

4

else is an aider?

I take it that that's your position.

5

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well --

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's either the company

7

whose stock is in question or you're an aider and

8

abettor.

9

MR. SHAPIRO:

You are only a primary

10

violator under -- under Central Bank if each and every

11

element of 10b-5 liability is satisfied, including

12

reliance on your statement, including the

13

"in-connection-with" test, and including loss causation.

14

None of those tests are satisfied here, but what is

15

satisfied is section 20(e), which says, did they

16

knowingly give substantial assistance to somebody who is

17

committing a fraud?

18

like a glove --

And that -- that fits this case

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

MR. SHAPIRO:

21
22

If we accept --

-- if Congress wanted the SEC

to address -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If we accept your theory

23

of the case and we then get another case in which an

24

accountant or an attorney who prepares the statement for

25

publication to the investors and then gives it to

37

1

Charter, and they are before us, could we find liability

2

under 10b-5 as to the accountants and still rule -- and

still keep our ruling in favor of your client here?

MR. SHAPIRO:

It really depends on -And if so, what would --

And if so, what would be

the rationale?

Some attorneys are control

10

persons within corporations, and in-house counsel that

falsehood may be liable as in the McConville case, which

accountants and attorneys who deliberately and directly

participate in negotiating -- or in drafting the false

disclosure statements?

Could they be liable and

21

under your theory of the case, but your client not

22

liable?

MR. SHAPIRO:

It -- it's possible.

Your

Honor, at the end of your -JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well what about in this

case?

Let's be specific.

As I understood an earlier

2

answer of yours, the answer was that Arthur Andersen

3

knew what was going on.

4

as I understand it, that's not what was charged -- but

5

if that's correct, Arthur Andersen did know what was

going on.

Can Arthur Andersen be held liable under

Absolutely --- whereas your client

cannot?

11

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, sir.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MR. SHAPIRO:

The reason --

And the difference is?

The reason is they issued

14

opinions that were circulated to investors, that were

15

attributed to them and which were authorized by them,

16

and if a lawyer does the same thing, if Steve Shapiro

17

writes an opinion letter and circulates it to investors

and it's full of falsehoods --

the auditor is going to indicate the basis for its

statement, that the transaction is okay --

17

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well --

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- and, therefore, isn't it

19

reasonable to suppose that they anticipated that their

20

statement would be communicated to the market?

21

MR. SHAPIRO:

That is just aiding and

22

abetting, and in fact Congress dealt with that squarely

in section 303 --

Doesn't that make any

MR. SHAPIRO:

That is not sufficient.

Congress addressed that in section 303 of

Sarbanes-Oxley, and it held that any person -- said any

about aiders and abettors.
MR. SHAPIRO:

It's talking about an aider

and abettor that misleads an auditor and then --

MR. SHAPIRO:

Which I thought speak

But is usually --

-- the auditor issues a false

certification.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- aider and abettor --

10

then again we get back to the question:

11

nothing in this world other than the company that puts

12

out the false statement and the aider and abettor --

13

MR. SHAPIRO:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

If there's

Well -- oh, no --- and is there something

in between?
MR. SHAPIRO:

16

Your Honor, there are other

17

persons that are control persons within a company who

18

are liable.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we're taking those out.

We're talking about independent actors.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Independent actors that don't

speak to the markets and cause direct reliance on their

23

own statements are aiders and abettors.

25

And they are supposed

Now, my -- you know, my friend made the

argument about Sarbanes-Oxley that there's a savings

We want the

Do you know, Mr. Shapiro,

if in the law of torts and the restatement of torts or

10

in other areas of the law there is some third

11

classification that's between aider and abettor in

12

principle?
MR. SHAPIRO:

13

I don't know the answer.

14

Although in these statutes themselves there are such

15

provisions not included in section 10(b).

16

in section 18(a), if you cause some other person to make

17

a false statement in a financial statement, you can be

18

held liable, but they are not invoking it in section 18.

19

Same thing under section 17.

20

to cause some falsehood, you can be prosecuted by the

21

government.

22

For example

If you engage in a scheme

But nowhere has Congress said that an

23

individual litigant can bring a claim like that without

24

regard for reliance and "in connection with" and the

25

loss causation test.

43

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Let's assume there is

2

reliance and loss causation.

Let me ask a question very

3

similar to what Justice Ginsburg has posed a couple of

4

times.

5

question is, is there an overlap?

6

overlap?

She has said is there a third category.

7

MR. SHAPIRO:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

MR. SHAPIRO:

My

Can there be an

No, I don't think there can be.
Why?

Because Congress intended in

10

section 20(e) to have an expert agency address these

11

cases and not to have the trial -JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

Congress intended an expert

13

agency to address solely aiding-and-abetting cases.

14

question is if there is an overlap -- A, can there be an

15

overlap?

16

reserve aiding-and-abetting alone to the agency affects

17

the determination of this case.

And if so, I don't see why Congress's intent to

MR. SHAPIRO:

18

My

We believe they are separate

19

categories and that Central Bank tells us exactly who

20

the primary violator is.

21

statement that investors rely on in connection with

22

securities transactions, and that is not these vendors.

23

That is exactly what section 20(e) addresses and commits

25

He is somebody who makes a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Could you amend that to

44

say -- you don't insist that he make a statement that

2

invest -- he could engage in a deceptive practice

3

directed at investments?

4

MR. SHAPIRO:

5

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

We

don't quarrel over that, Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

For example, for example,

7

let's assume in this case that Charter said we've, we've

8

got to let the investors know that our cost of doing

9

business is going up, and we want to you make an

10

announcement that you're jacking up your price 20

11

percent.

In that case there would be primary liability.

12

MR. SHAPIRO:

Absolutely.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why in that case is there

14

not also aiding-and-abetting?

15

why they are doing it, and they are doing it solely to

16

aid and abet Charter in its scheme themselves enjoying

17

a wash transaction.

18

aiding-and-abetting?

Why isn't that both primary and

MR. SHAPIRO:

19

We know perfectly well

Well, it's primary because

20

there is the communication to the market that's missing

21

here.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

isn't it also aiding-and-abetting?
MR. SHAPIRO:
those things.

You can call it -- both of

45

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If you can call it, why

2

isn't there the kind of overlap which raises the

3

question that Justice Ginsburg has raised?
MR. SHAPIRO:

4

You can't have primary

5

liability, which they are asserting here, without the

6

statement to the market.

7

conduct, and it can be by nodding of the head.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

And it can be a statement by

So you are saying there can

be an overlap but there is no overlap that helps the

the same thing as saying yes.

investor.

That's what's missing here.
So there is nothing wrong with the Eighth

Circuit's decision.

because it has no bearing on this case.

18

point in reversing the decision.

19

in our view for want of reliance, for want of loss

20

causation, for lack of "in connection with", and because

21

most importantly, Congress intended to remove this

22

category of case and commit it to an expert agency as

23

part of its very important reform effort to deal with

24

excessive litigation that was harming our economy.

It didn't address that refinement,

And it overrides the

Mr. Shapiro, what is your

24

strongest case, in your view, for the reliance

25

requirement?

47

1

MR. SHAPIRO:

Central Bank itself.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

3

MR. SHAPIRO:

Central Bank itself?

Because the Court there

4

said that even though the bank did something that was a

5

secret agreement that facilitated the issuer's

6

distribution of a false prospectus and caused all the

7

harm to the shareholders, it was a direct sine qua non

8

cause of all of that harm, that that was merely aiding

9

and abetting, because there was no reliance on anything

10

that the bank stated or anything that the bank had a duty

11

to state because of a fiduciary relationship.

12

Now, the vendors here are even far more

13

removed from investors than the bank was in Central

14

Bank.

15

Bank, and they were relying on it to do its job.

that was not sufficient because it made no statement

that the investors relied on.

19

There is no way you could --

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The investors knew about the bank in Central
But

There is no

Mr. Shapiro, in your

21

judgment, is the reliance requirement an element of

22

the violation or of the private cause of action?
MR. SHAPIRO:

23

It's the private cause of

24

action.

An important point, Justice Stevens, because

25

the SEC is not burdened with any of these elusive

48

1

inquiries into but-for causation, speculative questions

2

of indirect reliance; none of that burdens the SEC.

3

And the SEC also has power to distribute

funds to investors.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The court of appeals erred to the extent it

held that section 10(b) applies only to verbal

20

misrepresentations or omissions.

21

correctly held that this Court's decision in Central

Neither Petitioner nor the market relied on

or was even aware of any deceptive conduct or statement

by Respondents -JUSTICE STEVENS:

4

Mr. Hungar, I want to be

sure I understand one part of the government's position.

6

You do take the position that there has a violation of

MR. HUNGAR:

8
9

We haven't taken a position on

that question, Your Honor.

We take the position that

10

11

elements of a 10b-5 violation, but not the only

12

element.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

As I say, we have not taken --

questions and have not taken a position.

No, Your Honor.
You don't have an opinion?

We haven't taken a position, and

I know you haven't taken a

position, but I was just wondering if you have an

2

opinion?

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. HUNGAR:

No, Your Honor.

We haven't

5

addressed the other elements and those -- questions that

6

we have -- because there is no need to resolve them in

7

this case and because they weren't resolved by the court

8

of appeals or by the district court, we have chosen to

9

focus on what we think is dispositive and what was

10

raised and decided below, which is reliance.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

11

You have not reached

12

opinion as to whether there was a violation of the

13

statute?

14

MR. HUNGAR:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16
17

Correct.
Has the SEC publicly taken

a position on that question?
MR. HUNGAR:

I'm not sure of the answer to

18

that question, Your Honor.

Certainly individual

19

commissioners have given speeches and testified before

20

Congress to the effect that the Commission voted in this

21

case to agree with our position on deception, the

22

position that's expressed in our brief, and by a

23

three-to-two vote to disagree with the position on

24

reliance that is expressed in our brief.

25

know that there has been any official SEC Commission

But I don't

51

1

statement to that effect that's been publicly released.
As I said, the only deceptive conduct that

2
3

was allegedly committed by Respondents in this case

4

involves the backdating of contracts and the false

5

justifications for the price increase.

6

never disclosed to the market at any time during the

7

class period, and therefore, could not have been relied

8

on by the market or by Petitioners.

That conduct was

And as a consequence, under this Court's

9
10

decisions in Central Bank and in Basic, reliance cannot

11

be established because the presumption of reliance that

12

Petitioner seeks to invoke requires as a prerequisite to

13

its invocation the existence of a publicly disseminated

14

statement from the defendant that was disseminated to,

15

and therefore, relied on by the market.

16

happen here with respect to Respondents.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

That did not

Could the SEC get any

18

monetary recovery for the investors on your theory?

19

say yes, it's a deceptive practice, but this belongs in

20

the SEC's bailiwick, not in private suits?

21

MR. HUNGAR:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You

Yes, Your Honor.
Private suits; obviously

23

they are seeking damages for the decline in the share

24

price.

25

this case -- get by way of remedy?

What could the SEC -- suppose it should take up

52

1
2

MR. HUNGAR:

The SEC is entitled to obtain

civil fines, as well as disgorgement remedies.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there is no

4

disgorgement here because the vendors didn't get

5

anything.

For them it was a wash.
MR. HUNGAR:

6

Well, I don't know -- I believe

7

in the, not in this case but in the Adelphia case, which

8

is addressed -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

Well, but this case,

10

disgorgement would not be a remedy.

11

but those would be payable to the government, right?
MR. HUNGAR:

12

You say fines,

If I may -- yes, yes and no, I

13

think is the answer to that question; because under the

14

fair funds provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, section

15

308 of Sarbanes-Oxley, the SEC is authorized to take

16

fines and distribute those -- add those to disgorgement

17

relief -- and distribute them to investors.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18
19

disgorgement relief.
MR. HUNGAR:

20
21

with that point.

Well, I'm not sure I can agree

In the Adelphia matter --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22
23

vendors get?

24

did they have to disgorge?

25

But there would be no

What profits did the

For them it was a wash.

MR. HUNGAR:

They got -- what

Well, they obtained -- at least

53

1

it appears that they obtained advertising that

2

presumably had some value, although it didn't cost them

3

anything; and presumably the SEC could seek the value of

4

that advertising.

5

where the SEC did pursue the vendors that assisted

6

Adelphia in a somewhat similar transaction, it obtained

7

substantial monetary recoveries from them.

8
9
10

As I said, in the Adelphia matter

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I --

But did they receive

something that they then disgorged?
MR. HUNGAR:

I believe the allegations were

11

similar to those presented here.

12

certainly the SEC has the authority to proceed in that

13

fashion, and additionally the Justice Department has

14

the ability to proceed criminally and obtain substantial

15

monetary sanctions, either as part of a deferred

16

prosecution agreement, as part of a restitutionary

17

sanction and the like; but the fundamental point is that

18

for the private right of action to apply, as this Court

19

said in Central Bank, all of the elements of the private

20

cause of action must be satisfied with respect to the

21

individual defendant.

22

But in any event,

That is the line.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you agree, do you

23

agree with Mr. Shapiro, what I understood to be his

24

argument, that 20(e), the aider and abettor statute,

25

more or less occupies the field here and there is no

54

1
2

role for additional 10b-5 liability?
MR. HUNGAR:

Well, I wouldn't say that it

3

occupies the field per se, but what it does do is --

4

given the timing of this Court's decision in Central

5

Bank in 1994, followed by Congress's considering the

6

question whether to provide for secondary liability

7

in private actions, and its decision not to authorize such

8

secondary liability -- what it does clearly suggest is

9

that this Court ought not adopt the expansive view of

10

the implied right of action that Petitioner is urging,

11

but instead both because the Court is appropriately

12

cautious in expanding liability under implied rights of

13

action, and because Congress has now looked at this

14

question, not once but twice, and has declined to

15

provide secondary liability for secondary actors under

16

the cause of action.

17
18
19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You think that you are

either a principal or an aider and abettor?
MR. HUNGAR:

You can -- it's possible for

20

someone to be both but in order to be both they must

21

have -- they must have satisfied all of the elements.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

For the same act, I'm

talking about -- for the same act.
MR. HUNGAR:

Yes.

For instance an auditor

who certifies false financial statements and allows

55

1

that -- its certification to be, to be publicly

2

disseminated, thereby aiding and assisting in the

3

issuer's primary fraud, but is also a -- quite likely to

4

be a primary violator, because they have spoken to the

5

market.

6

is aware that they are making them; and so they would be

7

both a primary violator, but could presumably be pursued

8

as an aider and abettor.

9

preclusion of liability under both, but in order to be

The market is relying on their statements, and

I don't think there is any

10

in that category you must be a primary violator.

11

here, Petitioners have not established and cannot

12

establish the reliance element with respect to

13

Respondents, because nothing that Respondents said or

14

did was disseminated to the market during the class

15

period.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

And I take it in your view

17

they cannot establish the "in connection with"

18

argument?

19

MR. HUNGAR:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

We have not taken a position -Prior to the statment,

21

there is no reliance, but that there is "in connection

22

with" --

23

MR. HUNGAR:

Your Honor, I would hesitate to

24

say that, Your Honor, because the SEC and the United

25

States do not have to establish reliance in criminal or

56

1

civil enforcement proceedings, but we do have to

2

establish "in connection with," and we think they are

3

different.

4

what "in connection with" requires, and so I certainly

5

would urge the Court not to suggest that merely because

6

reliance is not established, therefore "in connection

7

with" must not also be established; and that is one of

8

the reasons why we think that the "in connection with"

9

question is best resolved, not in this case, but in the

10

case where it's been squarely presented, and preferably

11

a government enforcement action where the government

12

has an opportunity to tailor the case in an appropriate

13

fashion.

We think reliance adds something more than

14

The Court, as I said has been --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's at least a

16

little awkward for you to say we should wait for a case

17

in which it's been fully presented when the argument

18

you're making here wasn't fully presented, or at

19

least not decided below.
MR. HUNGAR:

5

there was no statement or omission.

MR. HUNGAR:

But on page 10a, they also talk

7

about reliance, Your Honor; and what's important here to

8

understand is that Petitioner's theory of reliance

9

rests on a misstatement, because they say the market

10

-- it's a basic presumption of reliance based on the

11

fraud-on-the-market theory case.

12

allegation of reliance in the complaint; that requires

13

something publicly disseminated.

14

was publicly disseminated is the statement.

15

court of appeals said is, that doesn't work, there was

16

no reliance because Respondents didn't make any publicly

17

disseminated statement.

18

complete, but certainly a perfectly reasonable resolution

19

of the reliance question; and therefore it is squarely

20

presented.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm looking at the court

of appeals decision which I thought just said that there

was no deceptive device.
MR. HUNGAR:

4

Your Honor, on page 10a, the

5

second line, the first full sentence, speaking of

6

Motorola and Scientific-Atlanta, "they did not issue

7

any misstatement relied upon by the investing public,"

8

and then it goes on the next sentence:

alleged financial misrepresentations by Charter was made

"None of the

the Respondents.
Again as I say, it's not as complete a

discussion of the reliance issue as we would have

14

thought appropriate if we had been writing the opinion,

15

but it certainly does touch on the question and we think

16

it's wholly presented.

Mr. Hungar.
Mr. Grossman, have you three minutes.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STANLEY M. GROSSMAN

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

21
22

MR. GROSSMAN:

23

I -- excuse me, I have three quick points to

Thank you.

make.
One, Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Hungar both said

59

1

that the advertising cost the vendors no money.

Well,

2

if the advertising cost them no money, why was there a

3

contract that they entered into for the purchase of

4

advertising?

5

appearance that Charter had this additional $17 million

6

in revenue.

Clearly it was designed to give the false

Number two, the SEC did take a position in

7
8

the Simpson case as it submitted an amicus brief;

9

Commissioner Cox testified before a House committee this

10

past spring that they wanted to submit the same brief on

11

the same points supporting the position that we are

12

taking here; and the testimony of Commissioner Cox is

13

appended to the briefs of Congressmen Franks and

14

Conyers.
Number three, Central Bank did not turn on

reliance.

17

conduct.

18

The plaintiffs conceded there was no deceptive conduct;

19

the court of appeals and the district court said there

20

was no deceptive conduct; it was strictly an aiding-and-

21

abetting case.

22

Central Bank turned on the issue of deceptive
There was no deceptive conduct in that case.

With respect to the reliance issue in

23

Central Bank, what the Court did say was under

24

plaintiff's theory he wouldn't have to prove reliance.

25

He only had to prove that he -- that the defendant

60

1

substantially assisted a defendant who engaged in a

2

primary violation, but he would not have to prove any

3

reliance by the aiding and abettor.

4

Number three, with respect to 20(e), how do

5

my friends on the other side read 20(e) in connection

6

with section 9 and section 18 of the Exchange Act, each

7

of which provides remedies and private rights of actions

8

against multiple parties?

9

would appear to be displaced by 20(e).

Under their definition, that
20(e) was not

10

designed, it was not intended to do anything but to give

11

the SEC the right to bring the very type of aiding-and-

12

abetting action that this Court barred in Central Bank.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
