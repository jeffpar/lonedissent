MR. van GESTEL:

2

QUESTION*

Yesa, sir.

To get back for a moment to the

3

point you adverted tc earlier, this is a case about

4

ownership and not about sovereignty as such, I take it

5

here.

6

ME. van GESTEI;

No, Your Honor.

What I meant

7

to suggest was that when ownership is in an Indian tribe

8

as opposed tc an individual Indian or another

9

individual, you have to deal with the elements of

10

sovereignty that are inherent in being an Indian trite.

11

You cannot avoid it.

12

implicates the sovereignty of the Indian nation.

13

they own the land, they are sovereigns ever it tc at

14

least a degree as permitted by the current law.

QUESTION:

Sc this really is a case that
If

Wouldn't there have tc be a

reservation embracing the land?
ME. van GESTEI;

No,

be a reservation.

20

that is subject to the sovereign rights and powers of

21

that Indian nation.

23

United States.

As I read the cases of this Court,

It dees not have tc be a

I think then we do then turn to the issue of
whether the first Congress or the Congress in 1793 which

passed the second Trade and Intercourse Act, intended

that there would be a private right of action available

under that statute.

12

the United States.

13

It draws its power, its

If we lock at the kind of analysis that this

14

Court has suggested is appropriate on the issue of

15

whether there is or is not a private right of action, it

16

seems tc me the cases cf this Court in recent years

17

indicate that no private right of action should be

18

determined to exist here.

19

I would initially hearken tack, we have cited

20

in our brief tc- the words of James Madison, who was the

There he said at

This

1

consideration rendered it highly important that this

2

whole business should be under the absolute and sole

3

direction of public authority.
Turning to the statutory language, which is

4
5

where we should first go to determine whether there is a

6

private right of action, you will find that there is no

7

mention in the statute whatsoever of creating a private

right.

MR.

6

van GESTEL;

This is an argument, Justice

7

Rehnguist, on the issue of the intent of the Congress in

8

1793, and it seems tc me the intent of the Congress,

9

among ether things,

in addition tc what its plain

10

language said, has to be drawn from Congress'

11

understanding cf what was happening at the time.

12

Cne of the difficulties in these Indian cases

13

is tc enable us to put ourselves in the position cf the

14

drafters of these statutes at that time, and I think the

15

intent of Congress has to be drawn, among ether things,

16

from their knowledge of whether Indian tribes were in

17

court,

18

were permitted tc be in court.
QUESTION;

But is it the intent cf Congress as

19

to whether the Indians should have a right of action

20

under this particular statute cr the intent cf Congress

21

as to how the merits of the statute should be

22

interpreted if the tribe were to be able to get into

23

court in seme way?

24
25

MB. van GESTEL;

In my reading of the cases of

this Court since 1975, it is the intent of Congress as

9

1

to whether the Indians should have a right of action

2

under the particular statute.

3

failed to provide remedies, but the remedies it provided

4

were remedies for the government to enforce, and it is

5

quite understandable why they did that.

It isn't that Congress

6

Shat this statute was designed to do was to

7

regulate what was occurring on the frontier, proballj

8

the least regulatable area in American history.

situation in which there are settlers many, many

10

miles from a government which was weak and almost

11

nonexistent.

12

what they were doing other than by having some control

13

in the central government was near impossible.

14

suggest that the Congress ir 1753 assumed that that

15

regulation could be affected by lawsuits between the

16

Indians and the settlers on the frontier is to me

17

astounding.

To attempt to regulate those people and

QUESTIONi

18

Tc

Well, let me ask you this

19

question.

Supposing that this action had been brought

20

in the Supreme Court of Oneida County or in the state

21

court system and -- so that there was no question that

22

New York would entertain that sort of a cause of action ,

23

your argument then that you are now making wouldn’t

24

address the situation where the action were brought in

25

the state court, would it?

10

MR. van GESTELi

1

If the acticr. were brought in

2

state ccurt and it were, as to use your words in the

3

opinion, a garden variety ejectment action, presumably

4

it would be subject to the state law, including the

5

defenses that would be available in a state court.
CUESTIGN;

6
7

Such as the statute of

limita ticns ?
MR. van GESTEL;

8
9

'74

Such as the statute of

limitations, such as adverse possession, the various

10

kinds of things that are said at least by the lower

11

courts net to apply when we are dealing with a Trade and

12

Intercourse Act case in the federal system.
ClESTICNs

13

Well,

I think that is an important

14

issue in your case, but why would it be resolved any

15

differently in state ccurt if the state court in

16

deciding the case is subject to the overall limitations

17

of federal law.
MR. van GESTEIi

18

Perhaps I misunderstand your

19

question.

20

brought, what would be the result in-the state ccurt in

21

New York, I suspect it wouldn’t last more than a week on

22

a motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds.

Well, but supposing there is an

Ihe federal question, I think

what you would come to then. Your Honor, is whether a

QUESTION:

12

Well, can’t New York give a right

13

cf acticr under that statute when you are talking about

14

a real

property question?
ME. van GESTEL:

I don’t think New York could

give a right of action under the 1793 Federal Trade and

17

Intercourse Act.

18

provide a common law claim.

New York under its common law could

12

QUESTION*;

Well, I won’t pursue you further.

13

My own personal reaction is that the -- your statute of

14

limitations and your arguments on the merits are

15

probably going to get you -- on the merits of the effect

16

of the statute, are going to get you further than the

17

private right cf action.

18

ME. van GESTEL;

Well, it seems to me that the

19

private right cf action is an important issue, and I

20

really don’t mean to back dewn from it in any sense.

MR. van GESTEL;

Put you've only get limited time.
I appreciate that, toe, Mr.

Justice White.
I will pass, at the suggestion of Justice
Rehnguist, to the statute of limitations issue because

13

1

you do have a situation whereby if it is to be

2

determined

3

case can be brought, then you must decide, well, can it

4

be Irought 175 years after the cause of action accrued?

5

In this instance, since we are dealing with a

that there is a right of action, and if this

6

federal statute, we must first look to see if there is a

7

federal statute of limitations, and there is none.

8

Under that circumstance, the law seems fairly clear that

9

the appropriate thing to do is to borrow the most nearly

10

appropriate state statute of limitations.

11

something that this Court has recognized, indeed as

12

recently as June of this year, in

v. Gratton.

connection with an action brought under the civil rights

statutes.

17

the nearest appropriate New York State statute of

18

limitations, and there is no statute of limitations in

19

the State of Sew York that is longer than 2C years, so

20

that any statute that you borrowed would certainly long

since have barred this action.

That is

from a

reading of the statutory history and the

14

discussion by these in Congress at the time of the

HR. van GESTEL:

2

Correct, which is a

conclusion that I think is inappropriate.

conclusion I think that flews from the theory that the

formed in

I don't think so,
I think what you have in part

to these Indian claims, not dissimilar from that

1946.

It is an effort to ferret out and find

16

1

out what claims are availble, to give those Indians who

2

feel they have a claim an opportunity tc present then tc

3

the federal government for action.
But again, it is a money damages statute by

QUESTIONs

2415.

20

MR. van GESTEI;

Under 2415, until the time

21

runs out which is contained therein, the United States

22

could bring an action.

23

QUESTION;

Yes.

24

When does the time run out?

25

MF. van GESTEI;

If my memory serves me, it

17

1

runs out at the end of this year.

QUESTIONS

5

Dc you think that the case of Ewert

MR. van GESTELs

8
9

I think Ewert v. Bluejacket

suggests that state statutes dc net apply, Justice

10

C’Ccnncr.

I am not suggesting that the state statute

11

applies; I am suggesting that the principle in federal

12

law that when there is rc federal statute, the federal

13

courts borrow the state statute and make it part cf the

14

federal law is what applies.

I den’t think that was the

I would suggest one other thing while I am

16
17'

talking about the issue of the statute cf 1 imita tiers,

18

and that is the issue of abatement that we have raised.

19

The Indian Trade and Intercourse Act is ret a

20

single

statute that has been in existence since 1790

21

down tc the present date.

22

you will see that it is a series cf separate,

23

specifically limited statutes in the early years, 1790,

24

1793,

1796,

’99 and 18C2.

25

became a single statute.

Indeed, when you examine it

It wasn’t until

1834 that it

And with the expiration of

each statute

you find there to he a right of action under it, would

3

abate under the law as it applied at that time.

4

any claims that may have existed, assuming

Now, I think another thing that we have tc

5

discuss and have to consider in dealing with this kind

6

of case, another defense, is a defense cf ratification.

7

The law, it would seem, suggests — and have in mind

8

that the concern here is that the State of New York,

when it purchased the land in

1795, did not do it in the

10

presence of a federal commissioner.

11

deficiency, and the sole deficiency.

12

York a couple of years later, in 1798, purchased seme

13

additional land in the presence of a federal

14

commissioner, and nobody has any concern or argues that

15

that was in any way inappropriate.

16

That is the

to be two separate bases.

they took, the view that these two positions were

4

interdependent.

conceded that unless there was a finding of waiver

within the meaning of the various Eleventh Amendment

cases,

that they could not prevail.

even further and may have -- and seems to have read

ancillary jurisdiction as not necessarily depending cn

that where there is a defense of sovereign immunity by

Sc I will not dwell cn that tut will turn cn

19

20

the question of whether under this Court's precedents

21

there was a waiver cf immunity with respect to the

22

counties.

23

there may not be any difference.

24

there has been any waiver or there would be any waiver

25

even with respect to the relationship with the Indians,

In that sense, I think it is important, and

31

We do not believe that

1

but that issue dees not necessarily ccire into play here

2

because there is no suit against the state by the

3

Indian s.

4

Put looking at that overall Question, we think

5

that this Court's decision in Edelman v. Jordan is

6

really quite dispositive.

7

there would be no waiver unless in the very first

8

instance the suit under which waiver is being sought

9

provides for a — suits that in terms includes actions

10
11

As we understand that case,

against a state.
New, whatever can be said about this

12

particular case, there is no statute which in terms

13

provides for suits against anycne, let alone the state,

14

and the argument is going to be made, of course, that

15

there is either an implied common law right of action or

16

that it is implied under the Trade and Intercourse Act,

17

with which we don't agree.

18

But there is no argument that there is any

19

statutory provision for a suit against anycne.

20

county does argue that that should make no difference if

21

the Court implies a cause of action against it or

22

against them, then in turn the Court should imply that

23

there is a, in terms of the possibility of a suit

24

against the state.

25

And the

New, it seems to us that that would undermine

32

1

what appears to be the logic behind the Edelman test

2

which,

3

lightly impute waivers to the state, or even the

4

possibility that the state might waive its sovereign

5

immunity, where there is no specific prevision in terms

6

for suits that might include the state, the state, by

7

actig under a statute, would have no idea that it might

8

be liable for suit because no one else was specifically

9

liable for suit.

There is an additional argument made that,

8
9

well,

that test shouldn't apply in this case because

10

what happened here happened in

12

Eleventh Amendment, which probably became effective in

13

1795 as well, and with little debate.

be the county, does not actually literally stem from the

18

Eleventh Amendment, but it really inheres in the

19

provisions of the Constitution in Article 3, which was

20

recently reiterated in the Pennhurst case as well.

21

it was -- that was firsst played out I think in Hans v.

22

Louisiana.

23

1795, and that the Trade

I don't think

The fact is that this Court

In this case, it would

Put

.
If you will recall, the Eleventh Amendment

24

arose because of the case of Chisholm v. Georgia, which

25

involved a suit by a citizen of South Carolina right

34

1

after the beginning of the Fepublic, against the State

2

of Georgia, and the citizen of South Carolina relied

3

upon the provision in the Constitution which provided

4

for suits against a state and citizens of another state,

5

and this Court agreed that that provided jurisdiction

6

against the contention of the states, including

7

particularly Georgia, that that provision of the

8

Constitution was not intended to be reciprocal but was

9

only intended to provide for a one way street of suits

10

against a state by citizens of another state.

11

Very soon after that, almost immediately after

12

the Chisholm decision, the Eleventh Amendment was passed

13

by the Congress and ratified by the states because the

14

Congress simply didn't agree with that interpretation.

15

But significantly, the Eleventh Amendment and the

16

Chisholm case didn't deal at all with a suit by a

17

citizen of one state against its own state, and I think

18

that there was never any question but that sovereign

19

immunity existed at that time.

20

indeed to think that the Congress which passed the

21

Eleventh Amendment in

22

in passing the Trade and Intercourse Act that the states

23

were not immune from suits by their own citizens.

24
25

1793,

And it would be strange

1795, had any thought that

So aoain, there is no basis for finding a
waiver of immunity here.

35

Finally, the ether part of the waiver argument

1

2

below was that this accusation was allegedly a

3

proprietary act.

4

acquisition of this land by treaty in any sense properly

5

could be viewed as proprietary, even if the state did

6

sell it for more than it originally purchased it fer,

7

substantially more.

I do not believe that that can be, the

8

But as our reply brief points out, there was a

9

substantial amount of state legislation afterwards which

10

at least delayed the payments, and we don't knew whether

11

the payments for this land were actually ever made.

What I will deal with my remarks this

and the defense of implied ratification asserted by the

Petiti oners.

10

First, the cause of action issue.

It seems to

11

me it is appropriate at this point to make two simple

12

observations, and then I will conclude my remarks on

13

this point.

14

Trade and Intercourse Act in a vacuum.

15

Congress was acting against a background of clearly

16

established federal law principles.

17

important principles were at the time, first, that the

18

Indian

international law exclusive rights to occupancy to their

20

land,

21

occupancy could be extinguished only by act of the

25

words of this Court in its 1974 decision, the

43

1

ncn-intercourse act prevision of that statute simply

2

codified what was or came to be the accepted principle

3

that Indian title could be extinguished only with the

4

consent of the United States.

5

provision must be construed, then, as against that

6

background, not as creating a wholly new substantive

area of law or a wholly new right of the Indian tribes,

but in

11

CUESTICN:

Dc you rely on any particular case,

12

Ms. Locklear, for establishing the federal common law

13

right of action that ycu assert?

14

MS. LOCKLEAR:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

15

Primarily we rely for that proposition cn the case

20

What occurred in that case was it

What the Court did in that case was lock tc

21

these principles of international law to ascertain,

22

first cf all, what the Indian tribes* right of occupancy

23

were to that land, and secondly, whether or not these

24

rights cculd be conveyed to the non-Indian claimant in

25

the suit without the consent of the general government.

44

The Court held in that decision that it could

2

net.

3

Now, we rely on those two principles as

4

forming the basic elements of a federal common law cause

5

of action in this case.
QUESTION:

6

But we really don’t have a case

7

involving a suit by an Indian trite, I suppose, on this

8

cause of action .
MS. IOCKLEAE;

9

There are no -- there are no

10

suits arising at that time by Indian tribes asserting

11

the precise cause cf action we have here, bet we think

12

that the principles in Johnson v. M’Intosh clearly apply

principle that Indian land could not be lost without the

We think that clearly between the two, the

principles cf Johnson v. M’Intosh, and Congress with

23

subsequent enactments cf the Indian Trade and

24

Intercourse Act, that there is a cause cf action.

25

Kcw,

I will turn my attention to the statute

45

1

of limitations issue in an effort to respond to seme of

2

the Court's inquiries in that regard.
first of all, it is the position of the

3
4

Respondents in this case that 28 U.S.C. Section 2415

5

certainly does apply, loth with respect to the monetary

6

damages aspect cf these claims and the title aspect.
QUESTION;

7

8

I thought 2415 only applied by its

terms to an action brought by the United States.
MS. 1CCKIEAE;

9

Yes, Your Honor, by its terms

10

it does, but I refer the Court to 2415 Subsecton

(a).

11

The words "Indian tribe" do not appear in that

12

subsection, but as Justice C'Ccnnor observed earlier, it

13

is clear from the language there that Congress intended

14

there to be a statute cf limitations governing money

15

claims brought by tribes as well as the United States.

16

That implication is clear from the following.
The statute first of all sets up a procedure

17
18

by which the Secretary of the Interior can ascertain

19

which money damages claims should be brought by the

20

United States.

21

second list is to be published which rejects certain

22

claims by the Secretary as unmeritorious.

23

subsection

24

rejected claims, the suit must be brought within a year

25

thereafter or be forever barred.

Those lists are to be published.

A

Finally,

(a) provides that with respect to the

46

It is clear from both the legislative histcry

and the statute framework itself that within that year

period

5

the tribes themselves.

Well,

but the Secretary of the

Interior, after he publishes, might be persuaded to

9

purpose of publication.

10

MS. LOCKLEAR;

11

QUESTION;

Perhaps that is the

That’s possible.

I mean, I don’t think you --

12

certainly you are arguing very much by implication and

13

not by what the statute says on its face.

14

MS. LOCKLEAR;

That statutory language,

15

however, is informed by the legislative history which

16

makes clear that the one year grace period was a period

17

provided for tribes themselves within which to act.

18

instance, there is much discussion in the legislative

19

history cf getting appropriate notice to the tribes

20

involved so that the tribes will knew wbat steps heve

21

been taken .

22

QUESTION;

For

Well, legislative history isn’t

23

quite the same thing as the statute, statutory language

24

that Congress chose.

25

MS. LOCKLEAR;

No, Your Honor, that is

47

1

correct, but I think between the two it is clear that in

2

the 1982 amendment to Section 2415, there is evidence

3

that Congress intended cr believed that the statute of

4

limitations governing

5

as it had applied for the prior five amendments to that

6

statute to tribal suits themselves.
Now,

7

ircney damages claims applied then

what we have, if Congress on the one hand

8

establishes a parallel track between the United

States

9

and tribal claims on trespass damages, we then refer to

10

subsection

(c) which says that no statute of limitations

11

shall tar title suits brought by the United States cn

12

behalf

cf Indian tribes.
QUESTION;

13

But that assumes that the cause of

14

action was subsisting as of that time.

15

cause cf action had earlier been barred?
NS. LOCKLEAR;

16

What if the

We agree, Justice Eehnquist, it

17

does assume that the cause of action existed, and we

18

alsc pcint to that as some evidence that the cause cf

19

action did in fact exist.

20

acts of Congress which indicate in- ever strcnger terms

21

that such causes of action did exist.

22

U.S.C.

23

refers to a case brought by a tribe which was in fact an

24

Indian Trade and Intercourse Act claim.

25

There are, however, prior

For instance, 28

Section 1362, which in its legislative history

QUESTION;

But 1362 is just a grant cf

jurisdiction, isn't it?

2

MS. ICCKLEARi

3

QUESTION;

That's correct, Ycur Hcncr.

The fact that legislative history-

4

might refer to a case, I would think that it would be

5

the jurisdictional aspect, not the merits, that would be

6

of interest in the case.
MS. LOCKLEAR:

7

That's correct. Your Honor, but

8

we point to both Secton 1362 and Section 2415 as net

9

giving rise to the cause of action itself but simply

10

evidencing Congress’ assumption that the cause cf action

11

ex iste d.
I think the legislative history of both

12
13

statutes is relevant for that purpose.
QUESTION;

14

Well, but the cause of action once

15

existed, but that doesn't evidence Congress -- any

16

particular Congress' view that the thing might not have

17

been barred at that time.
MS. LOCKLEARi

18

That's correct, Your Honor.

19

That's why I return to the literal language cf Section

20

2415 which on its face, Section 2415, subsection

21

its face states that no such claims brought by the

22

United

MS. LOCKLEAR;

It

has been accepted by all the parties in this case,

8

however, as meaning that result.

9

Petitioners —
QUESTION;

10

I think even the

Yes, but don't you first have the

11

burden of demonstrating that the action had not been

12

barred prior to 1966?

13

QUESTION;

Yes.

14

MS. LOCKLEAR;

15

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

Eecause if it was barred in

1966,

16

that statute doesn't revive any already barred claims,

17

does it?
MS. LOCKLEAR;

18

We accept that burden. Your

19

Honor.

20

however, as evidence of what Congress thought it had

21

been doing all along with the prior amendments of

22

Section 2415.

23

We point to the 1982 amendment of that statute,

QUESTION;

Yes, but maybe Congress was wrong

24

in thinking that.

I mean, it seems to me you have the

25

burden of showing what the law, not what Congress

50

1

thought the lav was.
QUESTION:

2
3

And that's just the view of one

Congre ss.
MS. LOCKLEAR:

4

The point here. Your Honor, is

5

that Section 2415 -- all parties here essentially admit

6

or acknowledge that the inquiry here is whether the

7

Congress has applied a statute, a federal statute cf

8

limitations.

9

we should look to state law to see what may be an

If it has not, then

the Petitioners argue

QUESTION:

11

I understand they argue that, but

12

it seems to me you must look to state law before 1966

13

first of all, and I think you rely on the Ewert case,

14

and that's all you've got for the prior period,

15

that right?
MS. LOCKLEAR:

particularly in light of the fact that Congress

of the statute was assuming that such causes of action

MS. LCCKIEAR:

14

Yes, Your Honor, but I think

15

that the Congress’ assumption on that point is some

16

evidence of what the law in fact was.

17

can also point to similar statutes involving restraints

18

on alienation of allotted Indian lands where this Court

19

has indicated that once Congress ascertains hew title is

20

to be extinguished in that respect, state law generally

that is the effect of the application cf a statute cf

MS. LOCKLEAR;

It is also true, Your Honor,

that in the unique context of Indian property rights,

57

1

that where Congress has intended to apply a state

2

statute cf limitations, it has generally dene sc

expressly.

4

subject, I believe, of this Court's opinion in United

In the context of Indian allotments, for

There are other instances where Congress, by

express prevision, has applied state law to govern

13

that in this respect, in the important respect of tribal

property rights and the basic statute that protects

15

these rights. Congress has not done sc.

16

That makes it all the more significant

In fact, when Congress has expressly dealt

17

with the issue cf statute cf limitations,

18

done so only with respect to the United States and

19

treated tribes similarly, cr been silent on the matter.

The point that we have to keep in mind in

the consequences are in a real viorld context, and they

because it did net perceive that the consequences were

so severe as the Petitioners have suggested.

Congress has reserved

In fact, Congress has the — many of the

We did not want to have to face

But the laches issue I think is one that is

that is one between an Indian tribal claimant and true

Ms. Locklear, could I ask you a

question about laches?

Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, of

that the counties here did occupy the land in good

QUESTION:

16

MF. KNEEDIER:

In fact, the point I would like

17

tc make with respect to the statute of limitations issue

18

is that the arguments that are being advanced-here go

19

far beyond eastern land claims, and they go far beyond

20

old claims as opposed tc new ones.

21

What the Petitioners are arguing for with

22

respect to the application of state statutes of

23

limitation would be a radical departure from what has

24

been the accepted norm in the area with respect tc

Indian law for the entire existence of this nation, and

ME. KNEEDLER:

What the effect would be would

be to create pressure for the United States to sue in

20

perhaps a shorter period of time to resolve the claim in

21

its own irind in a shorter period of time than Congress

22

has intended to allow the United States to have in

23

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, Congress had to get around

telling the Department of Interior to get with it.

68

1

didn't they?
MR. KNEEDLER;

2

Well, that's right, hut one of

3

the — hut it's important that in the background cf the

4

extensions of the statutes of limitation, one of the

5

things Congress focused on each time it extended the

6

statute cf limitations was the vast number of claims

7

that the Interior Department had to deal with,

8

specifically, in that case, ths claims that predated

9

1966.

But this is by no means unique to the older

10

claims.

11

Interior Department's programs, there are Indian claims

12

that arise.

13

States ordinarily is to have six years within which to

14

bring an Indian claim.

All the time in the daily administration of the

New, if othere was a cne year statute cf

16

limitations on a particular claim, the Interior

17

Department would be required effectively to decide witin

18

a year as to whether the claim had merit.

19

QUESTION:

Well, I don’t think anyone is

20

contending that after Congress prescribed particular

21

limitations, end up in 1982, that state statutes apply.

22

I think it is tc the period tefore Congress started

23

prescribing that these arguments are address.

24
25

MR. KNEEIIER:

Well, tut I had understood

Petitioners to be arguing that the 2415 and the Indian

69

1

Claims Limitation Act cf 1982 have nothing to do with

2

claims brought hy tribes, and we think that that is

3

clearly wrong both because, as Ms. Locklear pointed out,

4

that the text and legislative history of the act shews

5

that Congress intended it to apply to Indian claims, but

6

alsc that it is the appropriate source cf a statute cf

7

limita tiens.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION*

Well,

where does the text of the

act show that it was intended to apply to claims by
Indian tribes?
ME. KNEEDLER:

Well, specifically with respect

12

to the procedures that Ms. Locklear referred to before

13

with respect to furnishing the tribes, this is the

14

procedure for the cider damage claims, with respect to

15

furnishing the tribes with the information about their

16

claims and giving them one year within which to assess

17

it, and then the Indian Claims limitation Act says that

18

any cause of action not brought within a year shall be

19

barred, not just a cause of action by the United States,

20

and this isn't just in 2415.

21

statute that amended 2415 called the Indian Claims

22

Limitations Act which specifically says any cause cf

action, not just a cause of action by the United States,

24

shall be barred if not brought within one year of the

25

time the information was furnished to the tribe.

There was a supplemental

QUESTION:

1

Well, what is the relevance cf

2

those statutes relating to 2415 and the 1982 amendments

3

to the

1970 lawsuit brought before they were enacted?
MB. KNEEDIEF:

4

Well, I think what they are are

5

the most recent manifestation of the accepted rule that

6

has governed in Indian law.
This Court in a number of decisions, United

7
8

States v. Minnesota being perhaps the leading cne, tut

9

alsc most recently in United States v. Nevada and

10

others, has held that the United States, when suing cn

11

behalf cf Indians, that the usual rule that statutes cf

12

limitation and laches do not apply to such suits, apply

13

when the United States sues cn behalf cf Indians.

14

is clear that with respect to the United States bringing

15

this suit that nc statute cf limitations or laches would

16

apply .
QUESTION:

17
18
19

Sc it

But the United States didn't bring

this suit.
MB. KNEEDLER :

But I think that the background

20

that the United States is not tarred is important with

21

respect to this because the United — when the United

22

States is litigating in the area of Indian affairs, it

23

is typically bringing a cause cf action with respect to

24

property that it holds in trust for a beneficiary.

Who was one cf the proponents of

the bill?
MR. KNEEDLER;

Yes, and it was his remarks

16

that the Court quoted from in the 1974 Oneida opinion.

17

In fact, this paragraph was between,the two,

18

portions of his remarks that the Court relied upon in

19

Oneida, one in saying that the New York Indians should

20

have a right to go into federal court.

21

the twc

If I could go back even further, and this also

22

ties in to a question that Justice Rehrquist had in an

23

earlier time about what would happen if the Gneidas went

24

into state court, and in this regard, it is useful tc

25

lock at the case of Seneca Nation v. Christy in 162 U.S.

76

1

and the underlying state ccurt decisions.

2

The first aspect cf the case that is important

3

for this point is the fact that it was a cause of action

4

to invalidate a transaction under the Trade and

5

Intercourse Act by an Indian tribe.

6

reasons in state ccurt, but the New York Ccurt cf

7

Appeals and the lower court never suggested that an

8

Indian tribe didn't have a right to invoke the Trade and

9

Intercourse Act.

It failed for ether

What the court, the State Court dismissed

10

the

11

claim for failure to comply with the state statute cf

12

limitations, and this Ccurt declined to review it cr the

13

ground that there was no separate federal question

14

involved, on the ground that the state had furnished the

15

Indian tribe a special state statutory remedy, and that

16

the tribe had tc comply with the procedures under that

17

special remedy, which was the application of the state

18

statute of limitations.
But even the New York Court cf Appeals was

19
20

careful to point out the question is not whether an

21

Indian

state statutes of limitation; the point is that the

23

Plaintiff cannot invoke the special remedy given by

24

25

it is given.

title can be barred hy adverse possession cr hy

77

1

So this is a decision by the New York Court of

2

Appeals itself in 1891 recognizing that to apply state

3

law to wholly tar the claiir would be inappropriate, tut

4

that stae law applied because the state had furnished a

5

specia1 remedy.

6

So we have a continuing understanding that

7

Indian, that statutes cf limitation do not apply tc

8

claims brought ty Indians, and in fact, if one locks at

9

the text of the Trade and Intercourse Acts from

179C

10

onward, they, too, furnish a compelling indication that

11

Congress would not have intended state statutes of

12

limitation to apply.

13

They say that no transaction or title or claiir

14

to Indian property shall be of any validity in law or

15

equity, strongly suggesting that for a court to apply a

16

statute cf limitations or laches where Congress had not

17

specified would be inconsistent with the purpose of

18

voiding such transactions.

19

In fact,

where Congress has intended to apply

20

s-tate statutes of limitation tc Indian claims, it has

21

done so expressly; for example, in 25 U.S.C. 347, which

22

deals with claims for allotments, Congress has expressly

23

applied state statutes of limitation.

24
25

And finally, under this Court's analysis in
DelCostello of last term, it seems quite clear that the

78

1

appropriate aaalogy for the statute cf limitations in

2

this area is to refer tc federal law, tc which the

3

trustee would he bound.

I was just raising a question cf

ME. KNEEDLEB;

12

Cne,

Well, Congress has shewn a

13

readiness tc extinguish these claims when the parties

come into agreement, and if there was going to be

15

widespread disarrangement in New lork State because cf

16

these claims, I think that Congress could be expected tc

18

QUESTION;

19

MR. KNEEDLER;

20
21

Could the Secretary ratify it?
No.

Under our reading,

Congress would have tc act.
With respect to the equitable claims in the

22

case, we do not suggest at this point that laches would

actually entirely bar the suit.

5

One last point I would like to make, that in
