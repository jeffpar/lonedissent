ON EEHALF OF APPELLANTS

BAKER, JR., ESQ.

MR. BAKER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;

11

The question in this case is whether a statute

12

prcvidirg a minute of silence for meditation or

13

voluntary prayer constitutes an establishment of

14

religion, or whether it constitutes a common sense

15

acccmmcdation of the religious diversity of cur people

16

which

17

causes .

is consistent with the purposes of the religion

18

Alabama statute provides an opportunity tc

19

pray for so minded students, but this opportunity to

20

pray is one that is perfectly consistent with the letter

21

and the spirit of this Court's cases under the

22

establishment clauses.

23

type of accommodati on is one that is perfectly

24

consistent with the spirit of the religion clauses ir

25

that it promotes pluralism which pervades both of the

religion clauses

2

This type of a statute involves none of the

3

circum stances that have concerned this Court in pricr

4

cases.

This kind of a statute does not endorse

5

religion, it dees not endorse one religion over another,

6

it does not endorse belief over nonlelief.

7

a statute is perfectly neutral on its face.

8

is one that does not coerce in any way* it coerces only

9

silence.

This kind of
The statute

It does not coerce any religious practice, it

10

does not coerce religious belief, it dees not affirm

11

religious belief.

neutral in that it respects the consciences of all

13

students egually by allowing them either at their own

14

choice

17

It is in the nature of a statute

to say a prayer in silence or to say or simply to
this cne minute at the

In addition to Alabama, there are 23 other

18

states that have found that providing a moment of

19

silence is a reasonable way to accommodate the varicus

20

desires and needs of children in the public schools in

21

way that the setates have deemed to be consistent with

22

the case law in this Court.

MR. BAKER:

No, it would not have. Your

for meditation is perfectly constitutional.

QUESTION:

Justice Stevens, yes, sir.
As to the — similar to Justice

Whereas this one,

Does the first statute remain in effect?

Is

there still a duty tc announce?

5

ME. BAKERi

Your Honor, the first statute is

6

still in effect, but the statutes are basically

7

self-executing in the sense that the State Board

Education dees not enforce the statutes.

the teacher was under an obligation, a

MR. BAKERs

first statute.

I understand.
The difference between the

Appellee and our own position on this question really

comes down tc the significance of the word "prayer" in

24

the statute.

25

concedes the constitutionality of the moment of silence

As I have already said, the Appellee

statute for meditation, and the Appellee also concedes

2

that students have a right to pray silently to

3

themselves at any time that they would wish to during

4

the schccl day.

5

Obviously, then, during this one minute of

6

silence, the students, even under the 1978 statute, the

7

statute providing only for silent meditation, the

8

student would have the right during that minute to pray

9

silently.

In other words, the effect under either

10

statute, under the 1978 statute or the 1981 statute, is

11

the same as far as the classroom goes.

12

The difference comes down to that cne-wcrd

13

prayer in the statute, hut certainly it cannot be

14

unconstitutional simply to insert in a statute a

15

statement that it is constitutional -- what is

16

constitutionally permissible.

17

statute merely informs students that one of

18

that they can put this minute of silence to is that they

19

can use it to pray silently during that minute.

In other words, the

between

MR. BAKER:

What is the practical difference

8

between the two?

by passing the second statute?

10

MR. BAKER:
