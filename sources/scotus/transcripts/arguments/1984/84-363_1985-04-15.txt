CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Shapiro,

I think

you may proceed whenever you're ready.

4

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6
7

MR. SHAPIRO:

and may it please the Court:
At issue in this case is the constitutionality

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

of regional banking laws enacted by the states of

10

Connecticut and Massachusetts which permit New England

11

bank holding companies to enter those states and engage

12

in full service commercial banking, but which withhold

13

that same right from bank holding companies located in

14

other sister states.
The first question presented is whether the

15
16

Douglas Amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act

17

immunizes the statutes from scrutiny under the Commerce

18

Clause of the Constitution.
The second question is whether these laws are

19

20

part of an agreement among the states which requires

21

Congress'

22

Constitution.

23

statutes,

24
25

approval under the Compact Clause of the
And after briefly describing these

I'd like to address all of these questions.
The Massachusetts and Connecticut laws permit

companies from six designated New England states to

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

enter those states and engage in full service commercial

2

banking if the other New England state extends

3

reciprocity to Connecticut and Massachusetts.

4

regional laws operate in combination with another

5

regional law enacted by the state of Rhode Island, and

6

together they set up a multistate common market which

7

permits some companies to come in and denies that same

8

right to other companies based solely on the location or

9

the state origin of those other companies.

These

Thus, some

10

companies in some states get important competitive

11

benefits which are withheld from other companies based

12

solely on geography or state of origin.
Now,

13

these statutes in New England were

14

designed to permit regional expansion of bank holding

15

companies in New England while excluding companies from

16

the neighboring state of New York, regardless of their

17

proximity to New England and regardless of their size.

18

By the same token, companies that are in New England

19

such as petitioner Northeast Bancorp, are unable to

20

merger with banks located directly across the New York

21

border.

22

The practical impact of these laws can be

23

illustrated with a simple example.

Before passage of

24

these laws, companies in Massachusetts and in New York

25

competed on an equal basis for business in Connecticut.

Each could offer full service commercial banking in its

2

home state, but neither could offer full service

3

commercial banking in the state of Connecticut.
Now, however, Massachusetts companies can have

4
5

full service banks both in their own home state and in

6

the state of Connecticut, while their direct competitors

7

in the state of New York are still limited to their one

8

home state .
As the Court is aware, these regionally

9
10

discriminatory laws are not an isolated phenomenon.

New

11

York is flanked by the New England laws on the east, and

12

directly to the south its neighbors are in the process

13

of forming another exclusionary market, the Mid-Atlantic

14

market.

the southeast which also excludes the state of New

16

York.

17

entire East Coast into exclusive banking zones, and as

18

the Court is aware, some other — some 20 other states

19

are in the process of considering regionally exclusive

20

banking laws which would divide the countries into other

21

regions throughout the entire nation.

22

And there is a similar combination of states in

We are thus witnessing a partitioning of the

Now, as the Solicitor General and the Board

23

have acknowledged and the other respondents do not

24

dispute, these laws would violate the Commerce Clause

25

unless approved by Congress.
5

As this Court stated in

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 f ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the Eisenberg Farm case, and I quote,

2

could not exist as a nation if each of them were to have

3

the power to discriminate as against sister states with

4

respect to admitting articles of commerce.

5

combinations of states jointly impose this kind of

6

discrimination in unison, the danger of injury and

7

divisiveness and retaliation is even greater.

8
9

"The United States

And when

Now, where there is this kind of a threat to
the core purposes of the Commerce Clause,

this Court's

10

decisions require proof that Congress unmistakably gave

11

its consent to otherwise invalid state legislation.

12

that, we say, is a burden which respondents cannot

13

sustain in this proceeding.

14

And

The Solicitor General on the one hand has made

15

the argument that the plain language of the Douglas

16

Amendment permits this kind of discrimination among

17

sister states.

18

is that the Board may not approve an acquisition unless

19

there is a state law in existence which permits the

20

acquisition.

21

various kinds of laws which a state might adopt, and it

22

certainly doesn't say that a state in lifting the

23

federal ban is free to pick and choose among sister

24

states or to join into a regional confederation which

25

sets up a preferential trade zone for some states and
6

But all that the Douglas Amendment says

It doesn't say a single word about the

1

excludes the others.
QUESTION:

2

But doesn't the very paucity of

3

language, Mr. Shapiro, suggest that the states were

4

given very wide latitude;

5

interested in was state approval?

6

MR. SHAPIRO:

that all Congress was

To the contrary, Your Honor.

7

When Congress defers to the states in this manner with

8

general language of this sort, the Court has made it

9

quite clear that the presumption is that Congress means

10

to defer to constitutionally valid state law;

11

it refers to state law in these very general terms, the

12

negative ingredients of the dormant Commerce Clause are

13

part and parcel of the state law to which Congress has

14

deferred.

and when

«

15

QUESTION:

Well, Mr Shapiro,

I suppose the

16

McCarran-Ferguson Act doesn't really make it

17

unmistakably clear that states can adopt reciprocal

18

discriminatory taxes, and yet, the Court upheld that

19

power in cases like Western and Southern.

20

MR.

SHAPIRO:

That's a very important

21

question, and the distinction is between night and day;

22

and let me explain that.

23

In the McCarran-Ferguson Act, the statute

24

explicitly says not only that the states may regulate,

25

but that the silence of Congress shall not be deemed to
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

be any barrier to regulation or taxation of insurance

2

within the state.

3

course, was that this was an area that traditionally had

4

not been treated as part of commerce.

5

this Court changed the construction on that question,

6

and all of a sudden state laws across the country were

7

exposed to Commerce Clause challenge.

8
9

And the legislative history, of

And then in 1944

Congress acted within one year to pass this
law which expressly stated that it was lifting the

10

negative implications of the dormant Commerce Clause.

11

So you have unmistakable language, and you have

12

unmistakable language in the legislative history.

13

we say there is nothing remotely resembling that in the

14

Douglas Amendment.

15

Now, our brothers,

And

the private respondents,

16

have made the somewhat different argument here on the

17

authorization point, that Congress' division of the

18

banking industry along state lines is such a splintering

19

or such a balkanization that the states should be free

20

to pick and choose among sister states and set up their

21

own regional lines.

22

teeth of recent decisions of this court.

23

But this also is directly in the

In the Bacchus case, decided only last term,

24

federal law had balkanized the entire industry along

25

state lines, had given the states plenary power to

1

permit or not permit the importation of liquor,

2

that was not sufficient to displace the requirements of

3

the Commerce Clause with respect to discriminatory state

4

taxation.

5

QUESTION:

Well, Mr.

and yet

Shapiro, suppose it were

6

perfectly clear, that the Douglas Amemdment was

7

perfectly clear to the effect that the state may pick

8

and choose?

9

argument then, would you?

10

You wouldn't have any constitutional

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well,

if the Douglas Amendment

11

such as S.

12

Congress, said that a state may pick and choose among

13

sister states, there would be no Commerce Clause issue.

14

If a group of states tried to do it jointly without

15

Congress' approval, there would be a compact issue.

16
17

2851, the bill that was considered by

QUESTION:

But that would be only -- that

would be the only remaining issue would be --

18

MR. SHAPIRO:

19

QUESTION:

20
21
22
23
24
25

That is correct.

So doesn't this case just turn on

what Congress intended?
MR. SHAPIRO:

It turns on the specific

language of the Douglas Amendment.
QUESTION:

How do you ever get to any

constitutional issue other than the compact issue?
MR. SHAPIRO:

The Commerce Clause issue does

turn on the meaning of the Douglas Amendment, that's

2

quite correct.

3

QUESTION:

And if they intended it to give the

4

states the right to pick and choose,

5

Commerce —
MR. SHAPIRO:

6
7

9
10

there isn't any

That's correct.

It's an issue

of intent.
QUESTION:

But if they didn't — if they

didn't intend to reach that, then what?
MR. SHAPIRO:

If they didn't intend to permit

11

the states to pick and choose and to gang up against

12

their sister states,

13

violation of the Commerce Clause.

14
15
16
17

Now,

then there is a black letter

the reason for not inferring

authorization —
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose, Mr.

Shapiro, you

had an equal protection claim below which you dropped.

18

MR. SHAPIRO:

QUESTION:

MR. SHAPIRO:

21

(Laughter.)

We have reinserted that issue —

After reading Metropolitan Life.

22

MR. SHAPIRO:

23

QUESTION:

That is correct.

Your Honor is quite right.

I wonder if you think that having

24

read that case that you think the Massachusetts and

25

Connecticut statutes could surive an equal protection

challenge under that doctrine?

2

MR.

SHAPIRO:

We think for the reasons that we

explained in our supplemental brief that they clearly do

4

not, and we have suggested that the Court may wish to

5

consider this issue.

6

proposition.

7

the Commerce Clause or the Compact Clause, there is no

8

reason to reach equal protection.

9

with us on the first two issues, we would suggest that

It's, of course, a discretionary

But if the Court agrees with us on either

Should it disagree

10

it is appropriate to turn to equal protection, the

11

reason being that states across the country are now

12

considering statutes of this sort, and many, many

13

transactions will turn on the validity of these laws.

14

That is why we've raised this equal protection issue in

15

light of Metropolitan Life as a discretionary matter for

16

the Court.

17

Now,

to return to authorization, the reason

18

for not inferring authorization from Congress'

19

regulatory pattern, the balkanization by Congress,

20

compelling one that goes to the very structure of our

21

system of government.

22

it acts to protect all affected interests and all

23

affected states.

25

unrepresented interests will suffer serious harm without

When Congress regulates a market,

But when a group of states imposes its

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

any means to protect themselves.

2

should be especially cautious about inferring

3

authorization for regional discrimination from this

4

Douglas Amendment.

5

And the Court, we say,

The Douglas Amendments preserves the equal

6

status of each state, and it rests on historical state

7

boundaries, not on newly conceived regional lines.

8
9

QUESTION:

Let me go back there.

Suppose that

we agree that the Douglas Amendment didn't intend to

10

give the states powers to pick and choose.

11

the Douglas Amendment said no acquisitions by

12

out-of-state banks; isn't that right?

13

MR. SHAPIRO:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SHAPIRO:

16

QUESTION:

Well,

then,

That's correct.

Unless the state agrees.
That is correct.

Well,

if these agreements by the

17

state are not the kind of agreements the Douglas

18

Amendment purported to permit, then why shouldn't the

19

ban — why shouldn't the ban against out-of-state

20

acquisitions take over?

21

England banks could make out-of-state acquisitions.

22

MR. SHAPIRO:

Neither New York banks nor New

The ban would certainly be back

23

in place unless and until —

24

QUESTION:

25

How would you ever reach a Commerce

Clause issue?
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. SHAPIRO:

Unless end until the state

2

enacted a constitutional statute lifting the ban, there

3

would be no acquisition.

4

QUESTION:

So why wouldn't — if we agreed

5

with you that Congress didn't intend to let the states

6

pick and choose, then these states have not given the

7

right kind of consent.

8

MR. SHAPIRO:

9

QUESTION:

10

Well, these states --

They haven't given any consent.

MR. SHAPIRO:

These states have enacted laws

11

that purport to give consent, but they're

12

unconstitutional laws that have no blessing from the

13

Douglas Amendment.

14
15

QUESTION:

Well,

Congress anticipated.

MR. SHAPIRO:

QUESTION:

they're not the kind that

That's correct.

They didn't intend to permit states
in which event there's no way to

That's correct.

There is —

Well, then how do you ever reach a

constitutional issue?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well,

the Commerce Clause

24

contains a rule of constitutional law that is of

25

assistance to the Court in construing what the Douglas
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Amendment means, what it admits to allow.
QUESTION:

2

If the Douglas Amendment had said

3

bank holding companies may not acquire banks from out of

4

state except that states may consent to do that, but we

5

do not intend to give the states the power to pick and

6

choose, and if they try to pick and choose,

be deemed consent for purposes of this amendment.

MR.

QUESTION:

11

SHAPIRO:

it shall not

Well, that's --

Why isn't that really what you're

arguing?
MR. SHAPIRO:

arguing, but our position I suppose is slightly

different in this sense.

16

Douglas Amendment is if they have enacted a valid

QUESTION:

So neither the New York banks or

anybody else could — may acquire an out-of-state bank.

3

MR. SHAPIRO:

That is quite correct.

These

4

orders of the Board would have to be reversed in that

5

instance, ana these transactions could not proceed, and

6

my clients would be spared the competitive injury that

7

they now stand to suffer.

10

QUESTION:

Well,

I'm suggesting that if we

agreed with you, we'd never need to talk about the

MR. SHAPIRO:

We're not far apart, Your

12

Honor.

13

rule of interpretation that is relevant to the statutory

14

issue.

15

Wunnicke case and Sporhase and others have said that the

16

Commerce Clause means that you have to have unmistakable

17

evidence of consent to permit this kind of

18

discrimination, and we say that our brothers can't find

19

that unmistakable consent.

20

I believe that the Commerce Clause contains a

That's the only difference between us.

The

Now, they tried to find this unmistakable

21

consent from the legislative history, and the Court has

22

warned against reliance on fragments from the

23

legislative history to reach issues such as consent.

24

But there is no question that this legislative history

25

does refer to state discretion and to state policy and
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

certainly supports the view that the states may lift the

2

federal ban.

3

right of the states to pick and choose among sister

4

states or to enter into multistate exclusive banking

5

federations,

6

relinquishing the protection of the Commerce Clause.

But it doesn't say a single word about the

and it doesn't say a single word about

Now, respondents also have made the argument

7

8

here that the Board was entitled to deference when it

9

addressed the issue of authorization, but the Board made

10

specific findings about its own statute which we say

11

completely undercut respondent's submissions.
The Board found that the Douglas Amendment

12
13

"does not appear on its face to authorize discrimination

14

based on state location," and that the legislative

15

history contains "no discussion of the power of the

16

states to discriminate against potential out of state

17

interests."
Now,

18

the Board did say, of course, that the

19

Douglas Amendment is a renunciation of all federal

20

interest in the subject of interstate bank

21

acquisitions.

22

the Board,

23

But with great respect to my friends at

this is certainly an erroenous overstatement.
Federal law prescribes a host of statutory

24

criteria and policies applicable to interstate bank

25

acquisitions.

In this very case the Board had to look
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

at competition, potential competition, managerial

2

resources, service to the community and other standards

3

prescribed by Congress.

4

And besides this, even if there were a total

5

retreat from the field by the federal government, which

6

there certainly isn't,

7

because when Congress retreats and defers to state law,

8

it is deferring to valid state law consistent with the

9

principles of the Commerce Clause, as this Court has

10

it would be beside the point

said repeatealy in recent terms.

11

QUESTION:

Well, Mr.

Shapiro, do you think the

12

statement of the Board that Congress has just been

13

silent with respect to this pick and choose business,

14

that doesn't necessarily destroy the deference that's

15

due the Board, because the Board nevertheless though it

16

was consistent with the statute to do what it did.

17

MR. SHAPIRO:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. SHAPIRO:

20
21

22
23

Well, the Board --

Isn't that right?
We don't think so, Your Honor,

because —
QUESTION:

You mean they said we were acting

contrary to the statute?
MR. SHAPIRO:

They said they were waiting for

24

judicial clarification.

25

analyze this in light of existing —

They did not know how to

they felt there

wes room under the statute to do what they did.

3

MR. SHAPIRO:

QUESTION:

5

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes.

Or they wouldn't have done it.
And the rationale was this

6

renunciation theory which, with great respect, is

7

totally in error.
QUESTION:

8
9

There is no renunciation of federal —
Well,

I know, but they nevertheless

thought that the statute permitted what they were doing.

10

MR.

SHAPIRO:

11

QUESTION:

On this theory of renunciation.

Well,

I don't — on the theory of

MR. SHAPIRO:

Now, the Government's argument about deference

quite correct.

to the Board is especially puzzling here, because the

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

And it's

1

apparent that the Board disagrees with the Government's

2

literal meaning analysis because it said on the face of

3

the statute it sees no such literal meaning.

4

Now, since the Government thinks that

5

deference to the Board is so important, I'm sure Mr.

6

intends to explain to the Court what the Board's views

7

are, why they disagree with the Government's brief, and

The argument is that the burden of persuading Congress

21

They have to wait for Congress to say yes.

The wisdom of the constitutional scheme is

that before potentially harmful arrangements like this

There is in this record some indication that

18

the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and one other

20

member of the Board have some qualms about the policy,

21

the soundness of the policy that has been reflected in

22

the three orders that are at issue in this case.

23

also, as the Board's opinion reflects, there is some

24

confusion at the Board concerning the constitutional

issue.

We simply submit these things.

First of all,

the fact that in the face of their policy concerns --

3

and that's on page A-l-99 of the Appendix to the

Certiorari Petition -- and in the face of those

5

constitutional concerns that the Board would still

6

conclude unequivocally that these statutes are covered

by the Douglas Amendment, makes all the stronger the

8

conclusion that this is an instance in which the Board

Now, the petitioners contend that the states

2

were limited to a choice between two polar extremes.

3

They could either leave this Congress' total ban in

place, or they could lift it completely; but they had no

5

middle ground alternative.

6

And we profoundly disagree.

In our view it is very clear that what

7

Congress intended to do and what Congress did do was to

8

permit each individual state to tailor its own

It is an argument which would interpret the

power to regulate commerce, because Congress really had
two policy options available to it.

21

22
23
24
25

On the one hand, it

could have, as it did, delegate to the states the power
to do — enact general — it could have delegated a
rather general power to the states to enact.

On the

other hand. Congress could have specifically spelled out
the details of the kinds of statutory authority that the
states were to have.

And in choosing between those two,

the choice between those two was a significant policy
alternative available to Congress.

18
19

is that Congress is constitutionally required

What the petitioners are really saying is that
the Commerce Clause limited Congress limited Congress to
only one of those two alternatives.

It is an argument

that is squarely rejected by the McCarran-Ferguson Act

unconstitutional limitation pertains to something other
than the Commerce Clause itself, because Congress

Now,

finally, Justice White is absolutely

5

right that the petitioners have the burden of showing

that their view is the only permissible one, because the

agency charged with the implementation of this statute

8

has consistently entered orders approving acquisitions

9
10

11

in all cases where state statutes specifically permit
the particular type of interstate acquisition before the
Board.

And that includes not just these geographic

limitations but also the substantive limitations where

13

someone can come in from outside but can only engage in

14

the credit card business, for example.

15

The fact that the members — that the Board

16

may not have understood that its interpretation of the

and there was a pause, and then we were told, well,

3

they've agreed to reciprocity.

in

Beaux v. Barrett, 1953 that reciprocity alone doesn't

suggestion in this case that there is a reciprocal
agreement to exclude New York.

Reciprocity means you

agreement in this case, and there's been no response

perhaps among various states, as though Massachusetts

slogan "We hate New York."

Nothing of that sort is going on here.

They say isn't it amazing that Congress

didn't say so if it wanted the states to have this
latitude.

It's not at all amazing.

On the contrary,

there are several fundamental answers as to why this
Court ought not to depart from its precedents in
Prudential v. Benjamin and Western and Southern and
demand specificity and a kind of laundry list, as well
as clarity of Congress.
For one thing, there's an historical reason.
Congress in 1956, as the petitioners have never denied,
was expressly told some bankers believe that regional
approaches are a good idea.

the only reason Congress then

didn't mandate that solution was not disagreement with
its potential wisdom, but a sense that it would override
state discretion excessively to force that approach upon
the states.
In addition, there are practical
considerations.

As this Court held less than three

weeks ago in Town of Halley, the way legislatures work
and the Way that statutes are written makes it
unrealistic to expect a legislature to catalog.
There is finally, and I think most
importantly, a reason of principle, and that is this.
If Congress is to be the ultimate protector of the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

2

3

then when Congress chooses to protect the autonomy of

4

the states as laboratories, not by telling them which

5

formulas they may experiment with and which they may

6

not, but by leaving it to them subject to an

7

unconstitutional conditions doctrine, for this Court to

8

deny effect to that explicit, substantive congressional

judgment would at one and the same time deal a blow to
