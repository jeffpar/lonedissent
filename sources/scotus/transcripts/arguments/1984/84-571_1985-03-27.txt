Hr. Levy, you may proceed whenever you’re

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARK IRVING LEVY, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

9

HR. LEVY;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

10

may it please the Court, since the time of the Civil

11

War, Congress has strictly limited the amount that a

12

veteran can pay an attorney in connection with a claim

13

for veterans’ benefits before the V.A.

14

During the first 120 years that this policy

15

was in force, no court ever found the fee limitation

16

statute to be unconstitutional.

17

Gendron, in summarily affirming the decision of a

18

three-judge District Court, had sustained the

19

constitutionality of the statute against the procedural

20

due process challenge.

Indeed this Court in

21

In the present case, however, the United

22

States District Court for the Northern District of

23

California entered a broad preliminary injunction

24

against the constitutionality of the fee provision.

25

have brought this case to this Court on direct appeal to
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

We

1

defend the constitutionality of the statute.

2

The Court granted a stay of the District

3

Court's order and the fee limitation has remained in

4

effect pending this Court’s decision.

5

Now, before discussing the V.A. system. I'll

6

first briefly address the standard of review that is

7

applicable here.

8

before this Court is whether the District Court abused

9

its discretion in enjoining enforcement of the statute.

Appellees contend that the sole issue

10

We disagree.

11

preliminary injunction rests on an error of'law, it is

12

subject to plenary review and should be reversed as

13

legally erroneous.

14

Whereas here a District Court’s

There is no reason for this Court to defer to

15

a District Court on questions of law.

16

Court has no discretion to strike down on the basis of a

17

legal error a valid act of Congress.

18
19

20

And a District

Now, in light of this standard, let me turn
then to —
QUESTION:

Nr. Levy, appropos of the standard,

21

are you in a position to say whether the District Court

22

contemplated extensive further proceedings after the

23

entry of the preliminary injunction, more-receipt of

24

evidence, and that sort of thing?

25

MR. LEVY:

I think that was at least an open
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

possiblity, but the record in this case even at this

2

stage is quite extensive, and it's simply not clear how

3

much more would be required .

4

preliminary injunction was not meant to be a final

5

judgment --

6
7

QUESTIONS

Mr. Levy, the Government didn't put

in much evidence in the proceedings below, did it?

8
9

But it is clear that the

MR. LEVY;

It did not put in much evidence

because we think the case raises an issue-of law.

10

QUESTION:

But presumably, if it were to

11

continue, the Government would have some evidence to

12

present.

13

MR. LEVY;

We would certainly consider that in

14

light of the Court's opinion, and we would like to leave

15

open that possibility if the Court disagrees with our

16

principal issue that the case is ripe for decision ,on

17

the merits now.

18

QUESTION:

Well,

you do agree, I guess, that

19

the standard of review normally for a preliminary

20

injunction is the abuse of discretion standard.

21

MR. LEVY;

We think that's the appropriate

22

standard where the entry of the preliminary injunction

23

depends on an appraisal of the facts or discretionary

24

weighing of the relative equities of the party and

25

considerations of that sort.

2

When it turns on a question of law, though, we
do not think that's the —

3
4

QUESTION;

Hell, it wasn't clear to roe just

what the question of law was that you think governs.

5

MR. LEVY;

We think that this Court can

6

determine as a matter of law that the statute is

7

constitutional and that the District Court's entire

8

approach was incorrect as a matter of law.

9

that is the fundamental legal issue.

10
11

QUESTION;

We think

Can that be done, and Mathews v.

Eldridge provides the framework of analysis?

12

MR. LEVY;

Yes, we think it can be done under

13

the Mathews standard.

14

whether thesystem has an undue risk of error or is

15

fundamentally unfair,

16

particular case at least, that can be decided as a

17

matter of law, and that the District Court erred in

18

taking particular evidence about certain claims in the

19

system and basing a preliminary injunction on that

20

basis.

21

QUESTION;

Essentially the issue would be

and we think that in this

So it all boils down in your view

22

basically to the risk of error component in the

23

Mathews/Eldridge formula.

24
25

MR.. LEVY;

I believe that's right.

And more

particularly, Appellees' position is that the difference

between the representation cf counsel substitute

is,

3

discuss at length in our brief — and the representation

4

provided by retained lawyers is so critical to the

5

fairness and accuracy of the procedure, that it is a

6

matter of constitutional dimension rather than a matter

7

of policy making for Congress.

the free accredited service representatives that we

8
9

10

that

We think that really is the central issue in
the case, viewed in the overall context of the V.A.
system.

11

QUESTIOHs

Well, are there no factua findings

12

that are relevant to that, to the extent the court found

13

that as applied at least, the proceedings were not being

14

conducted in an informal manner, and that there is a

15

risk of error?

16

MR. LEVY:

We think there are no facts that

17

are appropriate for a court to take, at least in the

18

circumstances of this case; that the system viewed in

19

the overall context of the way Congress intended it to

20

operate and the recent and extensive consideration the

21

Congress has given to the system and the determinations

22

it made are sufficient to sustain the constitutionality

23

of

24
25

the statute.
But an important part of our argument is the

overall context of the V.A. system, and it’s to that
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that I would now like to turn.

2

QUESTION;

Did the Government simply rely on

3

the statute in this case?

4

clear.

The statute is perfectly

No one has any doubt about what it means.

5

HR. LEVY*

That’s correct.

6

QUESTION;

And the question is whether or not

7

it violates the Constitution, apparently, in the minds

8

of seme.

9

MR. LEVY;

That is the question presented.

10

And we think that for really two reasons the District

11

Court’s approach was error.

12

will discuss in more length later, Congress itself has

13

looked at this issue and has made certain conclusions

14

that are exactly contrary to what the District Court

15

determined on the record in this case.

First, as I say, and as I

16

In that situation, we think principles of

17

deference and judicial restraint require a court to

18

defer to the determination that Congress has made.

19

even beyond that, the question in this case is whether

20

the feeling that renders the system, in the generality

21

of cases whether it renders the overall system

22

fundamentally unfair and inaccurate, it is inappropriate

23

in our view for a District Court to rely on the kind of

24

evidence that it did here, the sort of individualized,

25

anecdotal, impressionistic evidence of some
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

But

1

self-interest that attorneys and claimants who are

2

dissatisfied with the system, and indeed even the sort

3

of anecdotal evidence that plaintiffs obtained in

4

discovery from V.A. officials — we think that is simply

5

not a reliable and substantial enough basis to strike

6

down an act of Congress.

7

At most what the court should have locked at

8

were things that went to the validity of the system.

9

the Chief Justice suggests, it would be the statute, the

10

regulations, the policies of the V.A.,

11

statistics perhaps and how it operates.

12

that level, even in an operational —
QUESTION:

13

systemwide
It would be at

Did the District Court, Nr. Levy,

14

hold the statute unconstitutional across the Board, or

15

just as it operated with respect with respect to these

16

particular Appellees?

17

NR. LEVY:

As

Well,

it’s or struck down the

18

statute across the board.

19

this case and the service-connected death and disability

20

benefits issue here.

21

Indeed, it went well beyond

But even under Appellees * characterizeticn , we

22

think it is misleading to call this as applied

23

challenge.

24

particular circumstances of an individual case and

25

decide whether the statute as applied there is or is not

Usually what that means is that you look at

In this case, the Appellees challenged the

cases.

among the claims and the claimants in those cases.

Now, those are a relatively small part of the

And Appellees simply ignored the differences

They also make a number of arguments against
the validity of the system that are in no way limited to

10

the classic cases they have identified.

11

systemwide complaints about the V.A. . And indeed,

12

Appellees in their brief make an effort to defend the

13

relief that the District Court entered here, which is a

14

nationwide injunction which is not limited to the

15

plaintiffs, either the organizational or individual

16

plaintiffs in this case, which is not limited to complex

17

cases, which is not limited to cases in which the

18

District Court, for whatever reason, thought the process

19

would be unfair in the absence of retained lawyers.

21

QUESTIONS

They are rather

Mr. Levy, can I interrupt for a

22

second, because I’m still puzzled about standard review

23

and the way we approach the case.

24
25

The District Court wrote an opinion about 50
pages long and made a lot of factual conclusions and
10

(202) 628-9300

1

statements in there, some of which might be called

2

findings, some of which might be conclusions; I don't

3

know .

4

But to the extent that they are findings of

5

fact in the District Court's opinion, do you challenge

6

them ?
J

7

MR. LEVYi

We have not come to this Court to

8

ask it to decide whether the District court abused its

9

discretion.

10

We do think that the methodology of the —

QUESTION:

So then if we think facts are

11

important, we may assume for purposes of deciding this

12

case that the District Court has correctly stated it.

13

MR. LEVY:

Well, in our reply brief, we

14

discuss at some length the record, and we think the

15

District Court's reading of the evidence is highly

16

questionable and vulnerable, but we have not presented

17

as a separate question whether the District Court —

18

QUESTION:

So your answer to my question is

19

yes, for purposes of deciding the case we should assume

20

that to the extent findings of fact are in the District

21

Court's opinion, they are correct.

22

MR. LEVY:

I think the Court would be entitled

23

to come to the conclusion that the District Court's

24

findings were clearly erroneous or an abusive

25

discretion.

But that is —
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

QUESTION :

But you have not so argued

2

MR. LEVY:

But that is not the reason we have

3

come to the Court.

4

QUESTION:

So again,

I just want to — for

5

purposes of deciding the case, we assume that the

6

factual statements made by the District Court are

7

correct.

8

MR. LEVY:

No.

I think our position would be

9

that for purposes of resolving our principal argument,

10

and that is that this case can be resolved as a matter

11

of law, .that assumption would be appropriate.

12

Court disagrees with us on that, but nonetheless feels

13

that the District Court's conclusions were erroneous or

14

arbitrary, abuse of discretion —

15

QUESTION:

If the

So your view is, as a matter of

16

law, even if there is a greater risk of error because cf

17

the statute, and that the veterans don't get the full

18

range of services that lawyers could provide them,

19

nevertheless the statute is valid.

20

MR. LEVY:

We would take the position that it

21

is constitutional, but we would also take the position

22

that the premise of your question is not the proper

23

basis for decision here, because Congress itself has

24

looked at the system, conducted extensive hearings over

25

a number of years, issued a number of reports, and has
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

come to the conclusion that the system is informal and

2

non-adversarial and that the V.A. service

3

representatives do provide effective assistance, and

4

that lawyers are unnecessary and undesirable here.

5

So we think that is the appropriate factual

6

premise for the Court's decision.

7

background, we think the statute is clearly

8

constitutional.

9

QUESTION*

And against that

I take it that it's the

10

Government's position that there are no findings of fact

11

of any kind that bear on the constitutionality of this

12

statute.

The statute must be evaluated on its face.

13

Is that so?

14

MB. LEVY*

Well, we take that position in

15

light of the congressional determinations.

16

not found that, there would be an open question of

17

whether it would be appropriate, but --

18
19

20

QUESTION;

Had Congress

Well, including the legislative

history, too.
MB. LEVY;

That's correct.

But I want to

21

reiterate that even if it were appropriate for the

22

District Court to make some kinds of factual inquiries,

23

we think that the approach taken here was fundamentally

24

misguided and that the court should have focused on a

25

more systemwide perspective to determine whether, under
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

i

1

the Eldridge standard in the generality of cases, the

2

system is fundamentally unfair and fundmentally

3

inaccurate, not whether in particular cases there may

4

have teen a mistake made or whether people might have

5

felt wrongly that they weren’t entitled to retain a

6

lawyer.

7

That is not the relevant question.

8

think the District Court's approach to the extent that

9

it went to this sort of individualized or anecdotal

10
11

And sc we

level was not a proper inquiry for the District Court.
QUESTION i

Well,

Mr. Levy, do you take the

12

position that in any Mathews v. Eldridge inquiry as

13

applied to a particular statute enacted by Congress,

14

that if there are sufficient congressional hearings and

15

review, that the Court in every such case should look to

16

the congressional history in deciding the application cf

17

Mathews v. Eldridge standards?

18
19
20
21

MB. LEVYs

Let me say that this case is

somewhat unusual in the sense that Congress is making -QUESTION*

Well, answer, if you would, whether

that is your view —

22

MR. LEVYs

That is not our --

23

QUESTIONS

-- that we should look first to the

24

extent of congressional hearings to determine whether a

25

court is entitled to make findings under Mathews.
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. LEVY i

It is not our view where the

2

extensive congressional hearings are contemporaneous

3

with the statute being enacted.

4

situation here.

5

But that’s not the

Congress was reviewing a statute that’s been

6

in effect for 120 years.

7

familiar with it.

8

and has reconsidered it subsequently on numerous

9

occasions.

The Congress is intimately

It has amended it from time to time

So when you’re making congressional

10

determinations about a statute that's been in place and

11

you’re looking to the operation of the system, it is in

12

those circumstances that we would say that deference is

13

due as a matter of judicial restraint to the

14

determinations of Congress.

15

It is not the typical legislative history, one

16

of construing a statute, but is contemporaneous with the

17

enactment.

18

QUESTION:

And would the same thing apply to

19

review of state statutes?

20

reviewed a statute already in effect and made findings,

21

then we should defer to that?

22

MR. LEVY;

If a state legislature had

Well, I think that would be an

23

arguable position.

24

into play, and we haven't taken a position on that.

25

think that would not necessarily be determined by this

case, but certainly where Congress is the legislative

body we think the argument —

3

QUESTION*

4

Is there another case where this

Court has expressed that framework of analysis?

5

MR. LEVY:

I believe so.

And we’ve cited a

6

number of them in our brief, but I can focus on a few of

7

them in particular.

8

was the mineral lapse case, the Court said that the

9

Indiana legislature was in a much better position than

I think in Texaco v. Short, which

10

the Court to decide whether the two-year grace period

11

was sufficient notice to satisfy due process when the

12

statutory requirements were being changed.

13

The opinion of Justices Brennan, Marshall, and

14

.White in Oregon v. Mitchell had a quite extensive

15

discussion of this proposition and concluded that as a

16

matter of judicial restraint and judicial competence,

17

courts should defer to the broad constititionally

18

applicable facts.

19

20

QUESTION*

Mr. Levy, you really are talking

about invalidating a statute on its face, aren’t you?

21

MR. LEVY*

I believe that’s right, although —

22

QUESTION*

Or at least you are not talking

23

about invalidating a statute as applied to a particular

24

case .

25

MR. LEVY*

Absolutely not.

That’s exactly

right

QUESTION:

You can't argue, you aren’t arguing

MR. LEVY;

They’re not arguing that that’s not

that —

conceivably possible.

We think those cases would be

few, if any.
QUESTION:

And you’re saying that Congress's

12

attention to this statute at least should preclude

13

invalidation on its face.
\

14

ME. LEVYi

Exactly

15

QUESTION:

Now, it’s invalidation on its face

16

in reliance on the operation of the system.

17

take the position that a court can never look beyond the

18

statute as written in the books or the regulations on

19

their face.

20

although not here, perhaps to look at the operation of

21

the system, but it’s the operation of the system, it's a

22

systemwide approach —

23

We don't

It is appropriate in some circumstances,

Well, is it possible here that the

court did make an as-applied analysis, but simply erred

25

in the extent of the relief that it granted under the

preliminary injunction by trying to enjoin the entire

operation?

MR. LEVY*

I don’t believe so, if by

4

"as-applied," you mean as to the three or four

5

individual plaintiffs in this case.

6

way the case was litigated below and the substantial

7

part of the record has nothing to do with them.

8

directed, rather, to this category of complex cases that

9

Appellees seek to identify.

10
11

QUESTION*

That was not the

It is

The District Court didn’t direct

itself to the facts of these particular cases?

12

MR. LEVY;

It did not; no.

There were

13

incidental portions of the record and perhaps incidental

14

references in the opinions, but that certainly was not

15

the basis for the District Court’s opinion.

16

QUESTION*

Was this a class action?

17

MR. LEVY;

It was not a class action.

18

Mr. Levy, I’m puzzled by your

could be some unconstitutional applications of the

statutes?

23

MR. LEVY;

Do you concede that there

I concede it is a theoretical

24

possibility, although as I say, it is doubtful it would

25

ever exist.

We think that there would have to be two
18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

things shown in order to make out that kind of a case.

2

First, it would have to be shown that the representation

3

of an attorney would necessarily be required in order to

4

have adequate representation and would categorically be

5

better than that provided by a service representative;

6

and second, that the claimant would be unable,

7

consistently with the fee limit, to have a lawyer

8

represent him.

9

We doubt that there are very many, if any

10

cases, in the first category where it can be concluded

11

absolutely that a lawyer is necessary and would do a

12

better job than a service representative.

13

doubt that there are mariy cases given pro bono lawyers,

14

given legal services, given that some service

15

representatives are in fact themselves attorneys, we

16

doubt that if a particular case ever arose where it was

17

truly necessary to have an attorney, that the claimant

18

wouldn’t be able to find one consistent with the 3 10 fee

19

limit.

20

And we also

But if those two conditions ever happen to

21

come up and could be demonstrated, then we would agree

22

that the statute could be held unconstitutional.

23

But that’s not the issue here.

That is not the issue here.

Now, at the risk of going back, I would like

2

to discuss the nature of the claims system that is

3

before the Court today, because that is fundmental to

4

the issue that we have asked it to decide.

5

The relationship between the Government and

6

veterans is a very special, indeed a unique one.

7

Throughout the history of this nation. Congress has

8

shown special concern and solicitude for veterans and

9

has provided a wide range of care and assistance to them

10

and their families.

11

That relationship is carried over to the

12

benefit system for service-connected death and

13

disability that is at issue here.

14

and more importantly for present purposes, the

15

procedural features of that system clearly reflect

16

Congress's special consideration of our nation's

veteran s.

their claims, and in which administrative claims

to that.

could have determined that in certain individual cases

should have been done.

5

But that doesn't cast doubt on the
Due process depends

Beyond that. Congress has looked at the issue

6

and has determined that in the overall claim system,

7

representatives do provide effective assistance, and the

8

V.A. does render help to the claimants, and so we think

9

that the District Court's findings, completely
\

10

inconsistent with Congress, Iiave to give way as a matter

11

of deference to the congressional determination.

12

And I should point out that one piece of

13

objective evidence in this record is that the success

rates for service representatives are generally as good,

15

and in some instances better than the success rates for

aside.

We think that's very

corroboration for the fairness of the system overall,

5

6

QUESTION;

So the veteran goes to the V.A. and

the V.A. directs him to a service representative?

7

MR. LEVY*

That would be possible, or they go

8

to a service representative or a service organization

9

directly.

And as I understand it, the service

10

organizations handle any claim without regard to the

11

possible likelihood of success or even without regard to

12

whether the veteran is a member of that association.

13

So I think, it's fair to say that a service

14

representative is available to every claimant in every

15

case if he wishes it.

16

QUESTION;

You've emphasized that the Congress

17

wanted to do away with lawyers in the proceedings in the

administration of this statute.

away with judges, both lawyers and judges, and have it

be a purely administrative procedure.

21

MR. LEVY;

They also wanted to dc

That’s correct.

Section 211(a)

bars judicial review of the administrative decisions in

overall nature of the system that Congress wanted here,

25

and part and parcel of that system is not to have it run

who provide other kinds of assistance.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Erspamer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GORDON PAUL ERSPAMER, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

7

MR. ERSPAMER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

8

please the Court, this case involves a central question

9

of what process is due veterans who have been killed,

10

maimed, or injured in the service of their country, and

11

in connection with the benefit programs Congress has

12

instituted to compensate them for those deaths or

13

injuries.

14

'More specifically, it involves a question of

15

whether a veteran can pay an attorney more than £10 out

16

of his own pocket to represent him in connection with

17

complex service-connected death and disability

18

compensation claims.

19

It also involves the validity of a separate

20

statute which criminalizes the payment of a fee in

21

excess of $10 and subjects the attorney and perhaps the

22

claimant to criminal penalties.

23

This case is unique among recent due process

24

cases in this Court, I think for several reasons.

25

Appellees do not seek additional opportunities to be

Lawyers have always bean allowed in the system

specifically authorized by statute, the same statute

15

that enacts the fee limitation.

So there was never any

In fact, if you look at the legislative

18

history of the statute, the purpose behind the fee

19

limitation, both in 1862 and in later years when it was

20

reenacted, culminated in 1924, was solely to limit

21

overreaching by unscrupulous attorneys.

22

So the explanation for this anomalous,

I guess the way I would approach that question

is that the court determined that the statute was

situations such that it should be struck down across the

unusual.

1

The court concluded that the fee limitatiin causes a

2

high risk of erroneous deprivations and causes many V.A.

3

claims not to be resolved on their merits, for several

4

reasons;

5

First, unrepresented veterans are unable to

6

conduct the extensive investigation, the witness

7

interviews, the documentation and the retention of

8

experts, the legal analysis and other steps necessary to

9

mount convincing V.A. claims.

10

And to respond to one of the questions I

11

believe that came from Justice Powell, 25 percent or

12

more of veterans at the regional office level are in pro

13

per and do not use service officers.

14

Veterans Appeal that figure is about half of that, but

15

there was uncont-radicted testimony in the record that

that — and I can almost quote it -- service officers

particularly outrageous in view of the facts of record.

15

of due process, would there?
MB. ERSPAMER:

Well, I disagree with that

because the system, as set up, contemplates lawyers and

4

has always contemplated lawyers.

5

QUESTION*

But I was asking about a

6

hypothetical system which was simply set up and not on

7

an adversary basis, but apparently as Congress

8

originally intended to set up the Veterans

9

Administration,

10

where you wouldn't need assistance; they

would help you process the claim, and that sort of thing.

11

Now, would that be unconstitutional?

12

MR. ERSPAMER;

I think that would depend upon

13

the facts that were adduced, and given the Mathews v.

14

Eldridge framework.

15

the context of the few variables that you've given me.

16

And I can’t answer that question in

I think it’s a rare instance where in a system

17

such as the V.A., where a veteran can be

18

constitutionally denied the right to retain counsel, I

19

can’t perceive of a case where that would be true.

20
21
22

QUESTION;

You think lawyers are an

inescapable part, of due process.
MR. ERSPAMER;

Well,

the right to retain

23

lawyers, I think, is at the option of the veteran.

24

course, the veteran is presumed to be capable of making

25

that decision whether his particular case has the

Of

1

complexity or the types of issues where he wants a

2

lawyer tc represent him.

3

And I think the mere fact that the V.A.

4

lawyers pervade the entire system suggests that it is a

5

system where lawyers are important.

6

Congress, through the entire 123-year history of the fee

7

limitation, has authorized lawyers to participate in the

8

process and the regulations authorize lawyers to

9

participate in the process is strongly suggestive also o

unable to collect fees from the claimants to support

their program.

And they can't — without the fees --

QUESTION

6

MR. ERSPAMERs

provide services to their members.

they cannot.

Do you think -- did I understand

14

you that it would violate the statute if one of these

groups had a house counsel that furnished — and they

potential violation.

is being paid by a law firm, I suppose, and he comes in

And

1

What's wrong with that?

2

ME. ERSPAMER;

3

Well, it's stretching I think a

little bit to call that a criminal violation, I agree.

4

QUESTION i

I would think so, quite a bit.

5

I suppose there's a lot of instances of group legal

6

services around the country, sort of an insurance

scheme.

And

I suppose one of these groups could do that.

8

MR. ERSPAMERi

Turning to the deference argument, I want to

10

emphasize, first of all, that this argument was not

11

argument or no legislative "facts," whatever, placed

13

before the District Court.

14

that the Government has waived that argument.

15

There is no

And I think on that basis

But let me address more particularly the

16

question of what congressional activity has existed with

17

regard to the fee limitation.

18

Government really ignores largely the congressional

19

enactments concerning the fee limitation.

20

First of all, the

And I think, as we pointed out in our brief,

21

the last time Congress really considered the fee

22

limitation was in 1924, more than 60 years ago, in terms

23

of legislative enactments.

24
25

There is no indication in the legislative
history that the fee limitation was intended to control

(202) 628-9300

2

or ncn-adversarial nature of hearings, or that the fee

3

limitation was an experiment regarding what the

4

Government likes to call informal dispute resolution, cr

5

that the fee limitation was intended to faciltate

6

administrative speed in processing of claims.

7

Since 1924, there of course have been drastic

8

intervening structural program and procedural and claim

9

changes in the Veterans Administration.

As I said,

10

during the same period of time there have been sweeping

11

changes in the law of due process.

particularly to Gideon and Goldberg.

13

And I refer

have relied upon is a Senate committee report with

regard to a judicial review bill in the 97th and the

13

96th Congresses, which do not constitute findings of

14

Congress by any means.

What they

15

On the House side, all they’ve relied upon is

16

House inaction on these bills, and legislative inaction

17

is certainly an unreliable guide to legislative intent,

18

and certainly the inference that the Government seeks to

19

draw from the failure to pass these bills or the failure

20

to even have them reported cut of committee in the House

21

is speculative.

There are many reasons why bills die in

And in fact,

I thought the Government's argument

was that for 120 years, except right after World War I,

MR. ERSPAMERs

That's all.

That's part of their argument.

provide for judicial review.

19

the "findings" that they use.

20

the original enactments regarding the fee limitation.

21

And the reason they don't do that is because the purpose

of the fee limitation was to protect veterans, not to

23

bar them from access to lawyers.

25

And that's the source of

Eldridge analysis.

14

First of all, it's important to point out that

this system.

I

think the important point to be made with regard to the

defend the fee limitation in the District Court solely

15

based upon the paternalistic arguments, overreaching by

16

unscrupulous attorneys, depletion of benefits.

The argument this morning has made clear

the V.A. system.

that their asserted deficiencies are right, that would

provide no legal basis for striking down the fee

would be to

require the V.A. to bring its procedures into conformity

Congress intended, not to make the system even more

adversarial by invalidating the fee limit and allowing

an infusion of retained lawyers.

And as I understand Appellees* argument this
