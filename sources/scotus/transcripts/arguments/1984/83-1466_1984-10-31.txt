6

the New Hampshire Supreme Court's reasons are extremely

7

important.

8

Those reasons are embodied in an affidavit of New

9

Hampshire Chief Justice King.

10

would like to address why the revocation argument
I think the facts bearing on

We have no need to guess in this case.

These reasons appear at the Joint Appendix on

11

Page 32, and the case comes here on summary judgment.

12

There are no findings contrary to Justice King's

13

affidavit, and on this record T don't think there is any

14

room to doubt that Justice Kina accurately states what

15

the New Hampshire court is doing with the residency

16

req uir emen t.

17

And what it is doing is as fellows.

As the

18

affidavit recites, the New Hampshire court regards

19

residency as establishing New Hampshire as the principal

20

place of physical residence for the indefinite future.

21

So residency at the time of admission is the New

22

Hampshire court's chosen proxy for promoting sustained

23

physical presence in the New Hampshire community.

In the New Hampshire court's view, the

residency requirement supports availability cf lawyers

for the extra activities the New Hampshire court expects

6

of them above and beyond basic concerns for competence

and ethical conduct.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gross, I suppose states vary on

10

NR. GROSS:

2

Suppose Mrs. Fiper here, living, as

3

she did, just across the border in Vermont, maintained

4

or joined a law firm that had an office in New

5

Hampshire.

Still not eligible?
ME. GROSS;

6

Nc, that would net be sufficient,

7

and the reason it wouldn’t

be sufficient is because in

8

order to achieve the New Hampshire court’s purpose cf

9

sustained physical presence in order to provide

10

availability for these tasks that the Court wants

11

lawyers to perform over and above basic competence and

12

ethical conduct, the requirement of an office doesn’t

13

seem to work as well.

14

The reason:

If it is not a primary office, it

15

doesn’t assure physical presence.

It isn't way down at the bottom.

I notice the rules that the court

construe deal with taking the bar exam, and the

admission of people who have just taken the tar exam.

10

What do the rules provide with respect to people who

11

have been admitted in other states maybe five or ten

12

years earlier and practiced for a period of time?

Is there any provision for, say, a member of

It must be by examination.
There is no admission on motion.

18

I think I'd like to pay some attention

19

that Judge Marshall asked about the lack of revocation,

20

because I gather it is a matter of concern.

21

to the question

There are two reasons why I suppose it is

22

being argued in this case that it is important to attach

23

-- important that the New Hampshire Supreme Court

24

doesn’t chase lawyers to assure they remain New

25

Hampshire residents after they take the oath.

New Hampshire's reasons are what they are,

The other apparent purpose, at least the
purpose that appears to me, is to argue that the New

10

Hampshire residence requirement fails to meet this close

11

tailoring test of standard privileges and immunities

12

analysis, and I would just like to observe that it is an

13

odd argument that the rule would have to be more

14

restrictive in order to meet the close tailoring

15

that is, more restrictive by requiring people to remain

16

New Hampshire residents to infinity in order to keep

their license.

Doesn't it bear on the strength of

your justifications for your rule if it is clear that a

20

lawyer who is a resident of New Hampshire can move out

MR. GROSS:

Yes, it dees, and I would like to

6

demonstrate to you why in practice it supports the

7

justifications.
First of all, we are not talking about a mere

8

scintilla of time.

If people are going to deal in good

10

The statistics offered by Mrs. Piper and

For example,

Hampshire lawyers had business addresses in the District

So, we are talking about lawyers who may leave

New Hampshire temporarily to come down here on

14

They

are swept into these statistics,

and the

15

statistics also sweep in lawyer who may practice in

as Judge Campbell of the Court of Appeals noted,

their comings and goings would

And I suggest to you that that is exactly what

7
8

the New Hampshire court has concluded, because their

9

present rule does work, and it dees work as a reasonable

10

proxy for sustained physical presence in the state in

11

order to carry out these extensive additional duties

12

that the New Hampshire court expects of members of the

13

New Hampshire bar.
If I can turn now to the legal points that we

14
15

are talking about,

the first legal point that we made is

16

that the New Hampshire court's residency requirements

17

shouldn’t be subject tc federal judicial scrutiny under

18

the privileges and immunities clause.
At the outset,

19

I wculd like tc make it clear

20

that we are not contending that state court regulations

22

by federal courts.

23

not our argument, and we den't make it here.

What we do argue, as the Court recently

QUESTION;

Well, you

are assuming, aren't you,

10

Mr. Gross, that the lawyers in question do business as

11

individuals when you say that the privileges and

12

immunities clause applies to.

13

doing business as a professional corporation, I presume,

14

couldn't claim the benefit of the privileges and

15

16

ME. GROSS;

For instance, a lawyer

I believe the citizens -- the

privileges and immunities clause speaks of citizens, and

18

so anyone who is a citizen could claim it.

21

QUESTION;

MR. GROSS;

That may be the Fourteenth

may practice as professional corporations,

we are held responsible as individuals to the court.
