ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

and false statements was reversed by the Ccurt cf

Appeals because the prosecutor in his rebuttal argument

8

to the

9

Respondent had committed fraud.

the Court, Respondent's conviction for mail fraud

Ordinarily, such a holding would be

11

unremarkable, one that this Court would not be called

12

upon to review.

13

this case that do make the holding remarkable; indeed,

14

that make the holding directly contrary to precedents by

15

this Ccurt.

16

However, there are three aspects cf

First, the error, if it was error, was not

17

noticed by trial court or counsel when it occurred.

18

was not preserved for appeal by an objection, and the

19

trial court was not asked to take any curative action.

20

Indeed, the first time that Respondent

21

mentioned this alleged error was in his papers before

22

the Court cf Appeals.

23

It

Second, the issue of the prosecutor's personal

24

opinion cn Respondent's guilt was not interjected into

25

the trial by the prosecutor but, rather, by defense

3

1

counsel who opened the issue during the course of his

2

argument that the prosecution had been unfair and his

3

argument that the prosecutor did not, in fact, believe

4

his own case against the Respondent.

5

And, third, the Court of Appeals reversed the

6

conviction without any inquiry into whether the

7

Respondent's rights to a fair trial were substantially

8

prejudiced by the prosecutor's comments.

QUESTION;

oral argument in the Court of Appeals?

11
12

Is this the case where there was no

MR. MC CCNNEII;

Ycur Honor,

I'm net aware of

that.

Mr. McConnell, may I just ask at

17

the outset, is there a Tenth Circuit rule that if either

18

prosecutor or defense counsel thinks that his adversary

19

has gone out of bounds, that the rule requires that he

20

object to give the

21

correct ?

trial judge an opportunity to

MR. MC CONNELL;

22

be the rule.

No, Your Honor.

That appears

23

not to

The rule does appear to be that if

24

the defense counsel goes out of bounds, the prosecutor

25

must object but may not pursue that line of inquiry; but

4

1

that if the prosecutor goes cut of bounds and there’s nc

2

objection by the defense counsel, apparently the

3

practice in the Tenth Circuit, as in this case, is that

4

that has no bearing or very little bearing upon whether

5

the Court of Appeals will take that issue upon on

6

a ppeal .
Which we would suggest, incidentally, is

7

8

exactly the cppcsite cf the correct rule,

because the

9

contemporaneous objection requirement is itself a rule

10

of appellate procedure.

11

designed to govern trial practice when one side opens a

12

line of argument, whether the other side can pursue that

13

line of argument during the course cf the trial.
That isn't what the contemporaneous objection

Isn't that the sensible rule?

Why shouldn't you give the trial judge the

the prosecutor to have lodged an objection 'was an

appropriate course.

20

But let me just point cut several -Why isn’t it the preferred

course?
MB. MC CONNELLs

21

There are several reasons why

22

it may not be.

And the most important is that there is

23

a tendency,

24

latitude to defense counsel in the course of a closing

25

argument.

a tradition if you will, of giving very wide

One of the main reasons for this is that when

prosecutor can’t always tell where it may lead.

it, to object rather than waiting until it's his turn to

is whether the Respondent was denied a fair trial.

1

QUESTION^

And therefore, should not the

2

government have objected?

3

ME. MC CCNNELLi

Yes, Your Honor.

But there

4

is a sense in which allowing defense counsel wider

5

latitude that would be allowed the prosecutor is a

6

sensible way for the trial court to operate, because, as

7

I said, you can’t always tell where a line of argument

does that authorize you to do wrong?
ME. MC CONNELL;

And it is preferred to allow the defense

No, Your Honor, but it may

QUESTION;

15

If you voluntarily pass up your

16

opportunity to object, can you then use that as the

bulwark of doing wrong in ycur argument?
ME. MC CCNNEII;

18

Your Honor, I would suggest

19

that it is not a matter of doing wrong.

20

of simply correcting a factual misstatement by defense

21

counsel.

have the prosecutor discussing the integrity of the

prosecution, rather than having the trial court --

QUESTION:

Is it part of your position that

the defendant failed tc object tc what you said?

MR. MC CONNELL;

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION;

then can't the defendant

10

raise the point that you didn't object?

11

good fcr the goose gcod for the gander?

12

MR. MC CONNELL;

Isn't what's

Your Honor, two points.

13

First of all, the contemporaneous objection requirement

14

is a requirement that has tc do with appellate

15

procedure.

16

introduces the line of argument, it is not ordinarily

17

required that the ether side launch an objection before

18

pursuing the same line of argument.

19

that line of argument.

20

When one side, during the ccurse of a trial,

He simply pursues

It may have been irrelevant.

It may have teen

21

prejudicial in some sense, but the other side pursues

22

that line of argument.

23

QUESTION:

I thought one of ycur positions

24

anyway was that when the defense counsel opens the dcor ,

25

the government is entitled to respond.

10

1

MR. MC CONNELLi

2

QUESTION.:

That's right, Your Honor.

Well, an objection wouldn't have

3

done defense counsel any gccd.

4

already entitled to respond.

5

At that point, you vere

You say in your papers, as I understand it,

6

that all of the other circuits have held that there is a

7

right to respond.
ME. MC CCNNEIIi

9

QUESTION:

11

MR. MC CONNELLi

Right.

QUESTION:
there

was no error at all?
MR. MC CONNELL:

16

QUESTION:

18

But had there been an error,

Aren't you going to argue that

15

17

Exactly.

if lawn v. United States —

13
14

That is on

the point that there was no error here whatsoever.

10

12

Yes, Your Honor.

I'm sorry?

Aren't you going to argue that

there was no error at all?
MR. MC CONNELL:

Yes, Your Honor.

This case

19

has several layers of problems with it.

20

we contend that there was no error at all, but secondly,

21

that even if there was error, it certainly was not plain

22

error such that the Court of Appeals should reverse

23

without there having been an objection.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well,

First of all,

aren’t you entitled tc take

the position that the prosecution had its option?

11

It

1

could object at the time and ask the court to instruct

2

the jury to disregard the false statements and to

3

reprimand counsel, or wait and do what he did; respond

4

and challenge the statements.

5

ME. HC CCNNEIIi

Yes, Your Honor, that is cur

6

position.

7

fair trial when the prosecutor takes the one course

8

rather than the other.

9

We believe that it does not deny Respondent a

Now, in any given situation, it might be that

10

in some cases it wculd be letter practice fcr the

11

prosecutor to object rather than to respond.

12

QUESTION:

Interruption of closing argument,

13

though, is something that often doesn’t sit well with a

14

jury.

15

to interrupt closing argument than to make cbjecticns

16

during the presentation of evidence.

I think lawyers are generally much less willing

17

I would think that wculd be a factor that

18

could be taken into consideration by whichever side

19

feels it’s aggrieved by the argument of the other side.

20

MR. MC CONNELLi

Yes, Your Honor.

I would

21

alsc like to point out that there may be a problem with

22

interjecting the trial court into the question of the

23

prosecutor's good faith.

24
25

There is a factual allegation of hypocrisy
that was made here.

The trial court itself is not in

12

1

the best position to evaluate whether that is either

2

true or false.

3

And if the trial court —

QUESTIONS

Well, the trial court is certainly

4

in a position to advise the jury that the prosecutor's

5

belief

in the veracity of a witness is irrelevant.
ME. MC CONNELL;

6

Yes, Your Honor.

But the

7

trial court may not be in a position to instruct the

8

jury that, in fact,

9

that w as untrue .
QUESTION;

10
11

there's been a factual allegation

But the trial is in a better

postion than you and I.
ME. MC CCNNEIIs

12

Ihat's right, Your Honor.

13

And that is why it is our position that the Court of

14

Appeals erred in reversing this conviction'here when the

15

trail court had not been given an opportunity to rule on

16

whether the prosecutor's closing arguments were in

17

error.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE*.

I think we'll resume at

(1i00 p .m. )

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. McConnell, you nay

resume your argument.

5

MR. MC CORNELL;

Kr. Chief Justice, before

6

lunch,

7

argument was dispensed

8

It was, in fact, and so states in the first paragraph of

9

the opinion.

you asked whether this was a case in which oral

10

I wanted

with before the Tenth Circuit.

to return to the issue that we were

11

discussing before lunch and the question specifically

12

whether the doctrine of invited response is not one that

13

encourages the prosecutor to fail to make an objection

14

when he ought to.
I would like to point out that we are not

15
16

arguing the equivalent of two wrongs make a right here

17

in this case but, rather, that when examining the

18

prosecutor's comments to see whether they constituted

19

error at all, they have to be examined in context.

20

in the context of the defense provocations the

21

prosecutor’s comments were not error, they did not

22

prejudice the accused, they did not have any detrimental

23

effect on the right to a fair trial in that particular

24

c o n te x t.

25

Ordinarily, there are two dangers involved

14

And

1

when the prosecutor expresses his personal opinion on a

2

matter at trial.

3

conclude from the prosecutor's opinion that there is

4

evidence outside of the record that's known to the

5

prosecutor, but which was not presented to the jury,

6

which would support a finding cf guilt or innocence.

7

The first is that the jury may

Thus, the jury may be tempted to convict net

8

on the basis of the evidence, tut rather on the

9

supposition of this extra record evidence.

It wccld

10

suggest that in this context, after the defense

11

provocation, that there was no danger cf that

12

whatsoever, just as long v. United States, the

13

prosecutor did not say cr insinuate that his comments

14

were based cn perscnal knowledge.

15

Indeed, the comments of the prosecutor were

16

repeatedly interlaced with comments cn the evidence, and

17

his comments were truly opinions on the evidence and not

18

opinions based upon anything outside.

19

For example, after reviewing what the varicus

20

Apcc officials h.ad said to Respondent and Respondent had

21

said tc them, the prosecutor stated, "I don't knew what

22

you call that.

23

evidence and you can remember the testimony.

24

remember what they said and what he admitted they said.

25

I think it's a fraud.”

I call it fraud.

15

You can look at the
You

1

Note the way the prosecutor continually refers

2

the jury back to the evidence.

3

prosecutor is expressing his opinion because the defense

4

had raised

5

this instance, the response did not infringe upon the

6

right of the accused tc have the jury decide the

7

question on the basis of the evidence before it, because

8

the prosecutor’s remarks in this context did not imply

9

or suggest or insinuate the existence cf extra-record

10

Admittedly, the

the issue of the prosecutor’s opinion, tut in

eviden ce.

11

The second danger from prosecutors expressing

12

their personal opinions on matters is that, as the

13

representative of the government, they may over-awe the

14

jury with the power or prestige of the government. Thus,

15

it may tempt the jury to convict not on the basis of the

16

evidence before it, tut rather cut cf a respect for the

17

position of the government in the case.

18

This danger is also remote in the context that

19

we’re talking about, that is tc say, in a fair resperse

20

context where the defense has challenged the integrity

21

of the

22

prosecution.
The prosecutor in this case did not invoke the

23

power and prestige cf the government.

He did not make

24

any of

25

quoted, particularly in older decisions in which the

the types of arguments that cne sometimes sees

16

1

jury was being exhorted tc fellow the lead of the

2

g overn ment.

3

Indeed, the prosecutor specifcally labeled the

4

opinion that he gave as his personal impressions, since

5

it was asked of me.

6

prosecutor that he was just giving his personal opinion

7

because it was asked of him by the defense counsel.

Thus,

the jury was informed by the

And indeed, there is something a little

8
9

peculiar about the thought that the jury in this case

10

might have been over-awed by the power and prestige cf

11

the government because, after all, it was the defense

12

that had introduced this notion that the prosecution had

13

been behaving unfairly and that it had been

14

reprehensible, and that the prosecution did net even

15

believe its own case.
When the prosecutor responded by saying,

16

"Yes,

17

we do

believe in our own case,” that did nothing mere

18

than cancel cut the defense counsel's remarks, thus

19

refocusing the jury's attention where it belonged,

20

namely, on the evidence, instead of upon the baseless

21

accusations by defense counsel.

22

Thus, in this case, just as in Long v. United

23

States, where the ccurt — and the court's words there:

24

"Defense counsel's own comments clearly invited the

25

reply which he now attacks."

17

1

Now, again, the question for the Court today

2

is whether this type of response constitutes reversible

3

error,

4

whether the defendant was denied a fair trial as a

5

result of this.

6

analysis of the prosecutor's comments that defense

7

counsel himself had introduced this line of argument,

8

that he had opened the door to the discussion of the

9

prosecutor's views.

10

QUESTION;

whether there was prejudice to the defendant, and

It is certainly relevant to that

Hr. McConnell, what if the defense

11

counsel got up and argued something along the following

12

lines;

The defendant has nothing to hide.
Could the prosecutor then comment in closing

13
14

argument on the fact that the defendant didn’t take a

15

stand,

as invite, being invited?
MR. MC CCNNEII;

16

Your Honor, I would net think

17

that that particular instance would constitute an

18

invitation.

19

fully,

20

would lead to something that wculd constitute a comment

on

But to try to answer your question mere

QUESTION;

That would constitute so-called

23

plain error.

Wculd you agree that there are

24

circum stances when, even though the defense counsel

25

might have opened the door a crack, and the response

18

1

would amount tc plain error?

2

MR. MC CCNNEIL:

I can imagine responses that

3

would constitute plain error.

4

contending that whenever the defense dees anything that

5

is all

has a blank check to make whatever response it cares

7

to .

10

improper, that that means that the prosecution

Our position is simply that where, as here,

9

Your Honor, we are not

the response is directly related to the provocation and
is proportionate tc it,

11

QUESTION;

that it is a fair response.

When you say "fair” and

12

"permitted," we're talking basically about what, the

13

supervisory rules for federal courts?
MR. Me CONNELL;

14

Yes, Your Honor; although in

15

the extreme, I would think that there would be a due

16

process component as well, tut we are talking here about

17

the federal court system.
QUESTION;

18

Mr. McConnell, do you think it

19

would ever be appropriate for a court of appeals, in the

20

exercise of its supervisory power with this kind cf an

21

issue,

to take into account similar comments in other

22

cases.

Say it had a recurring problem in the circuit ;

23

they thought the prosecutors needed to realize the court

24

was serious about enforcing a rule.

25

Or do they always have to confine themselves

19

1

to the particular case before them?

2

MR. MC C0NNEI1:

Ycur Honor, I think that it

3

is perfectly permissible for that to be taken into

4

account.

5

is plain, there are two determinations that should be

6

made.

When the Court is considering wh.ether an error

7

The first is that the error was plain in the

8

sense of its being obvious, or clear, and the fact that

9

But there's a second determination that needs

being obvious, was an error of substantial prejudice to

the accused.

In. this instance, we would submit that the

error failed under both of those considerations since we

do not consider it plain in the sense of being obvious.

14

Just as in Long v. United States, this Court

15

held that the prosecutor was entitled to express his

view on the credibility of the witnesses before the

17

Court because of the fact the defense counsel made an

improper attack upon that issue of credibility.

MR. MC CONNELL:

12

error,

In this case, for example, neither the defense

Had there been an

The trial court that had seen the

But in the absence of an objection, there was

23

no such ruling, and thus the appellate court was denied

24

the benefit of that.

25

Just to summarize -- and I see that my time is

23

growing short

it is cur position that the

prosecutor's comments in this case were not error.

And

that is because once the defense had opened the doer to
the line of argument concerning te prosecutor's
integrity in bringing the prosecution, the prosecutor
was within his rights in making a moderate, perfectly
direct, not disproportionate response to that.
We do not believe that in anyway that that
interfered with the respondent's right to a fair trial.
But, in addition to that, the failure of respondent to
lodge an objection required a still more exacting review
of the nature of the error and the nature of the
prejudice which the court did net engage in.
And then, finally, since the court failed to
consider the issue of prejudice, at least as a matter of
their burden to ensure that they're not reversing on the
basis of harmless error, they should have done so.
Having not dene sc they reversed, we contend,
needlessly on the basis of an error that was, in fact,
invited by the defense and ret noticed by defense at
trial.

We believe that this is a serious and needless

drain upon the resources available within the criminal
justice system.

MR. BAILEY;

Mr.

Chief Justice, may it please

the Court, Bill Young’s defense was that he had no

fraudulent intent whatsoever.

7

he had worked for Apco Oil Company for, oh, several

8

years and his best friends were the people he was

9

dealing with on this transaction.

The evidence shewed that

18

Hugh Bradley, asked Billy Yeung if he could get any

20

many times, saying that he had fuel oil he could certify

21

as crude oil under the then-exi sting tier procedures

22

under the regulations of the Department of Energy.

23

Billy had been called by a fellow named Ross

And Bill Young then bought condensate, which

24

is very rich in hydrocarbons -- it’s gathered at the

25

wellhead — and paid more for it than he could charge,

25

1

for that matter, and blended the condensate with fuel

2

oil, and his testimony was he was putting the barrel

3

back together.

4

There were two things that strongly, we felt,

5

supported the proposition that he was acting without any

6

fraudulent intent.

output of the refinery.

14

residue product that has no other products in it, that

15

the Apco Oil Company noticed a change in their output

16

and tested it, and found that there was fuel oil going

17

in.

18

Also, the government witnesses who knew Mr.

19

Young testified that he was an honorable and honest

20

person, a person of integrity and, in their opinion, had

21

no intent to defraud Apco.

22

testified that he was putting the barrel back together,

16

17

the prosecutor felt he needed something outside the

MR. BAILEY;

I think if he had stopped

13

that he, under the Tenth Circuit, of course, he was

14

obligated tc object tc my closing argument if he thought

was in any way improper.
QUESTION;

Kay I ask why no objection was made

17

by you, as defense counsel, to anything that you thought

18

he said was improper at the time?

19

MR. BAILEY;

Cur understanding of the Tenth

20

Circuit rule was, if he objected to my closing

21

statement, then that was the way he preserved his

22

record , and I was not obligated tc object to his because

23

it was plain error.

24
25

In retrospect, I don’t know whether we would
do the same thing again.

The point made sc often ir.

32

1

these other cases from the Fifth and Sixth Circuit is

2

that it emphasizes this point to the jury and only

magnifies the opinion cf the prosecutor tc get up and

call attention to that in the jury's presence.

-QUESTION;

Well, what is the reason that it is

prosecutor’s expression of his personal opinion of guilt
is improper?
ME. BAILEY;

Your Honor, there are a number of

reasons advanced fer that.

I think that — let me see

if I can put my hands right quickly on some of these
points .
QUESTION:

Well, if they’re net i irmed ia t e 1 y at

hand, perhaps you could come up with it later in ycur
argume nt.
MR. BAILEY:

Yes.

Well, here, for example, is

a statement by the Sixth Circuit in United States v
Bess.

"An Assistant United States Attorney purports to

represent the people of the United States, and thus
carries a special aura of legitimacy about him.
Implicit in an assertion of personal belief that a
defendant is guilty is an implied statement that the
prosecutor, by virtue cf his experience, knowledge, and
intellect has concluded that the jury must convict."
QUESTION:

Does that make any sense to you?

Certainly a defendant -- a defense lawyer can express
his view that his client is not guilty; why shouldn’t a
prosecutor be able to say he thinks the defendant is
guilty ?
ME. BAILEY:

Well, Your Honor, it’s just

HR. BAILEY:

19

Drinker, writing on legal ethics in this case, which is

20

quoted, I think addresses that point, Ycur Honor:

21

"There are several reasons for the rule, long

established, that a lawyer may not properly state his

He goes cn tc say, "I don't think you’re doing

3

your job as jurors in finding facts as opposed to the

4

law that this judge is going to instruct.

5

that's honor or integrity?

courtroom and-say that's honor and integrity.

believe it."

Stand up here in an Oklahoma

jury.

It was highly improper, and it was rendered in an

10

extremely aggressive and loud finger-jabbing tone.

11

was not in the measured tones of counsel here today.
QUESTION:

12

Of course, Mr. Bailey, we don't

13

know.

14

that's how it was done, but that doesn't come through in

15

the transcript.

But it is necessary for you tc prevail for

this to be plain error; right?

18

ME. BAILEY:

19

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Therefore, do we net have to assume

20

that if you had made an objection, that the trial judge

21

would have sustained it?
MR. BAILEY:

22
23
24
25

I think you'd have to assume

that.
QUESTION:

And, therefore, I can't understand

why you didnt' make the objection, because I don't see

39

1

how that could have possibly hurt you.

2

MR. EAILEY:

Well, there were two.

The first

3

reason was that the way we construed the Tenth Circuit

4

rule,

5

committed under the —

it was not -- we felt that there

QUESTION:

was plain error

But you certainly aren't go.ing to

7

gamble on a reversal by the Court of Appeals rather than

8

getting your client off.

9

MR. BAILEY:

There was the deep concern that

10

this would only emphasize this to the jury.

11

already been said.

It 's not like an objection to an

12

improper question.

This was already out there.

13

maybe in retrospect, it would have been better to have

14

done so.

It had

And

15

I take comfort in the notion that all these

16

cases that we have cited, where there is no objection

17

made, that was done by a let better lawyers than I,

18

they apparently reached the same conclusion.

19

QUESTION:

and

Do you not agree, cr do ycu agree

20

that a lawyer objecting to argument of another lawyer,

21

interrupting, takes considerable risk of having the jury

22

have a negative reaction to the interruption?

23
24
25

MR. BAILEY:
think

Very much so, Your Honor.

I

there is no question about that.
QUESTION:

So that probably explains why you

40

1

didn’t object, and why the prosecutor didn’t object.

2

HR. BAILEY;

I think that’s very true, Ycur

3

Honor.

4

They resent it,

5

detriment of counsel and his client.

It does have a negative impression to the jury.
I think.

QUESTION;

6

I think it works to the

Does that not suggest, then, that

7

lawyers and trial judges should be allowed quite a

8

latitude in that respect?

9

HE. BAILEY;

Ch,

I think they should be

10

allowed latitude, considerable latitude, and I think

11

that that’s done all the time,

12

just seems to me that one cannot have a prosecutor --

13

here,

14

opening statement, said "I am a trial attorney from the

15

United States Department of Justice, the Fraud Section,

16

in Washington, C.C. and I am here to --

18

Eut it

the prosecutor, at the very first sentence of his

QUESTION;

17

and properly sc.

Do you think that would have hurt

him with the jury or helped him in Oklahoma City?

19

(Laughter.)

20

HE. BAILEY:

I think that’s in with what they

21

refer to as aura, the power and prestige and legitimacy

22

that is very strong.

23

think,

24

telling you that I am new becoming an expert witness.

25

am testifying.

And when he gets up and says, "I

regardless of the evidence,

And I

I think — I’m

1

That’s just wholly improper and carries a weight, as

2

this Court noted in United States v. Berger, that

3

transcends vastly anything that can be done to offset

4

it.

5

There is no response possible at that point.

6

QUESTIONS

But, Mr. Bailey, again if I may

7

just threw this thought out.

8

of the trial judge or any instruction of the jury after

9

the argument was over, so ycu wculd have avoided the

10

harm of interruption?

No.

Bid not.

And

that is a

tighter fit, I think, Your Honor.

15

good,

16

consideration of yes, you get seme kind of instruction

17

that statements by counsel are not evidence, which was

18

incidentally said by tbe judge anyway at the very*

19

outset, but does that rob ycu of your possibility on

20

appeal?

I think it probably would have

I don’t think it would have done any

but had it been done, there is the tactical

You know, they say it's been corrected.
QUESTION^

21

What about -- did you make a motion

22

for a new trial on this ground?

23

ME. BAILEYi

24
25

That is what I locked

No.

Went straight to the Tenth

Cir cuit.
QUESTION^

Ycu mean you wanted to let the

42

1

error stay in the record without giving the trial judge

2

a chance to correct it?

3
4

MR. BAILEY:

No.

Frankly, never thought of

it, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Bailey, what's happened in this

6

case, what I understood was the Tenth Circuit rule, that

7

if you didn't object, then you're foreclosed from

8

raising it.

9

Isn't there a Tenth Circuit rule that says

10

that,

11

your adversary goes out of bounds, you have to object if

12

you're going to, in order to give the trial judge a

13

chance

whether it's prosecutor cr defense counsel, if

to correct.
MR. BAILEY:

14

My understanding of the Tenth

15

Circuit rule has always been that the prosecutor is

16

obligated to object to defense counsel’s statements and

17

cannot respond to them improperly, and if they do sc and

18

express their own opinion, it's plain error.

19

not -- defense counsel is net required cr obligated to

20

object

22

to an expression of a personal opinion of g'uilt.
QUESTION:

21

in

That is exactly what the result was

this case.

23

MR. EAILEY:

24

QUESTION:

25

And you do

Bailey,

That's correct.
New, you said a moment ago, Mr.

that — as I understood you -- that the reason

43

1

you didn't ask for a curative instruction at the close

2

of all

3

the argument on appeal?

4

the argument was that you were afraid of losing

HR. BAILEY:

No.

The truth is, Your Honor,

5

that it never occurred to me.

6

to Justice Stevens's remarks that one can see in

7

retrospect where, from a tactical point of view, you

8

could come to that conclusion; that, well, here we have

9

a situation where the jury has teen fatally prejudiced

Eut I was just responding

10

by what has been said, and no curative instruction,

11

is pointed cut in seme of these cases, would rectify

12

that or cure it.

13

as

But if you ask for it, and it was granted,

14

then presumably you would be in a dramatically weakened

15

position to argue on appeal.
QUESTION*

16

Don't

you think that the appellate

17

court would be perfectly capable of perceiving that the

18

jury proceedings had been fatally infected beyond the

19

point of curative instruction if, in fact, that was the

20

case?

21
22
23

MR. BAILEY*

I certainly hope so, Your Honor.

I certainly hope so.
QUESTION:

If, at the close, as part of the

24

instructions, the trial judge had said, "New, both of

25

these lawyers have been engaging in expressing some

44

1

personal opinions, and I remind you they have no place

2

in the process cf deciding," would that have cured all

3

of thi s ?

4

HR. BAILEY;

Not in my judgment, Your Honor.

5

I think that the statements of the prosecutor, of his

6

personal opinion of guilt of the defendant, cannot be

7

cured by any curative instruction.

8

possible to do that.

9

I don’t think it's

I think that the weight that that carries is

10

so heavy, that there is no way to cure it.

11

simply cannot be permitted.

And it

The statement by this Court in Berger that the

12
13

prosecutor has a duty to try the case fairly, not just

14

to see

15

expressions of the defendant's guilt, as language as

16

emphatic as this Court could write, is the proper rule;

17

that it is simply denial of a fair trial for the

18

prosecutor to make himself a witness and to say that --

19

it suggests that there are things he knows outside the

20

record

21

would not bring this case.

QUESTION;

Well, that isn’t necessarily the

case, because it depends on how the question or '

HR. BAILEY;

that's just -- with

8

ME. BAILEY:

9

Your Honor,

What's totally improper?
For the prosecutor to dc as you

say .

10

QHESTIGN ;

But it must be improper for seme

11

other reason than indicating that there's a lot of

12

evidence outside the record that would support it,

13

because the prosecutor is expressly negative, that

14

inference, in his statement.
MR. BAILEY;

15

Well, I think I see what you

16

mean.

17

in my opinion he's totally guilty.

You're saying based cn the evidence, I say that

QUESTION;

19

MR. BAILEY:

Yes.
It still makes the prosecutor a

20

witness.

21

to say if expression of personal belief were permitted,

— that Billy Young intended to

QUESTION:

16
17

Mr. Bailey, can I ask one other

procedural question?

18

MR. BAILEY:

19

QUESTION:

Yes.
As the Chief Justice pointed cut,

20

21

Appeals.

How do they do that there?
