To ignore this essential element of a

Amendment claim would be in effect to convert the

However, the submission of the United States

10

in this case does not relate to the without just

11

compensation aspect of the cause of action but rather to

12

the question of whether there was a taking at all that

13

required the payment of just compensation.

14

There are four points that are important to

15

us, and I will identify them at the outset;

16

there was no taking in this case because the bank did

17

not pursue procedures before the Petitioner to either

18

obtain a variance or to seek to comply with the

19

applicable regulations? secondly, that the Court of

20

Appeals applied flawed analysis in determining what

21

would be a taking in the zoning context; third,

22

Court cf Appeals ignored the principle that unauthorized

23

conduct by agents of the government such as the

24

application of the wrong regulation here gives rise to a

25

claim for just compensation rather than being in the
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

first, that

the

1

nature of a tort for wrongful regulation that does not

2

give rise to a claim for just compensation; and fourth,

3

that no compensation was owed for a so-called temperary

4

taking in the circumstances of this case.

5

Now, in answer to several of the questions

6

that have arisen before, looking at the first point, it

7

does seem to us that the failure of the bank to seek to

8

pursue procedures before the Planning Commission dees

9

end this case, and I think that the fact that neither

10

the Court of Appeals nor the District Court passed on

11

the question of whether the plat complied with the 1973

12

regulations only reinforces the conclusion that that's a

13

matter for the Planning Commission to decide in the

14

first instance, and in fact, the Planning Commission did

15

decide that the submission did not comply with

16

provisions that were present in both sets of

17

regulations, the steep slope requirements, the length of

18

the cul-de-sacs, the road grades, all matters pertaining

19

to public safety that are quite aside from the density

20

of the residential units on this piece of property.

21

And so the point is that the developer should

22

submit his case to the Planning Commission, and as Mr.

23

Estes pointed out, counsel for the bank conceded that

24

variances would be required in this case to overcome the

25

difficulties with the road grades and with the length of

2

Commission to grant approval to the preliminary plat and

3

then he would apply for variances.

4

He simply wanted the Planning

But in fact, the subdivision regulations

5

applied by the Commission say that the variance has to

6

be applied for before the preliminary plat is approved.

7

And that alone, the absence of a variance request is

8

alone sufficient basis for rejecting the plat.
