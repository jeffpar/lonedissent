Feturning to the Fcdrigue decision, Your

23

Honors, if you read through the opinion itself, it is

24

manifest that the Court’s decision in Rodrigue was based

25

on what it felt Congress had intended, tut it justified

9

1

Congress’s intention on innumerable places throughout

2

the opinion ty references tc this particular type cf

3

work as not being maritime cr admiralty type work.
And if you look specifically at the comment on

4
5

Page 36C of the Court’s opinion, it said that the

6

accidents in Rodrigue and Dory, which were the two cases

7

before the Court at that time,

8

this is not "the ordinary stuff of the admiralty."
In other words, this

9

the Court uses the word,

type of work is not the

10

type of thing that you usually think of when you think

11

of a maritime setting.
New,

12

cf course, there is no Question that

the

13

Rodrigue case involved a platform three miles out,

sc

14

this guy with respect to his claim under some

15

compensation Act would have teen covered under the

16

Longshoreman and Harbor Workers Act because of OCSIA.

17

There is no question about that.

18

But when the Court talks about his work being

19

non mar itime, there is no difference between the type of

20

work that -- the wire line work that was being dene in

21

Dory and Rodrigue and the wire line work that is dene

22

inside

23

the three mile limit.
So that if the work that is done -- described

24

in Rodrigue and Dory is non maritime because it is

25

nonmaritime, then it is nonmaritime because it is

inshore as well as offshore.

HR. BROWN:

15

Well,

Your Honor, perhaps this is

not the case, because the facts don't support it,

17

perhaps you are going to have to write us a postcript to

18

Director versus Perini, because that particular thine is

19

left over.

20

In other words, that is a matter,

tut

I think, for

21

future litigation,

whether a person who is strictly —

22

in ether words, he uses the boat strictly as a taxicab.

23

Is he covered as a result of an injury which occurs

24

while he is using that boat as a taxicab.

25

Director versus Eerini goes quite that far, although it

14

I don't think

may.

I don’t know the answer to that.

MR. BROWN;

It may.

whether cr net this Court agrees with what the Fifth

7

all of which are cited, and that is whether or not there

8

is any support in the jurisprudence cr otherwise for the

9

preposition that oilfield work is inherently maritime.

10

If you go back to Pippin and Budrough, you

11

will find that that was one cf the rationales of the

difference is that the maximums under the Lcngshcreiran

the maximums under the Louisiana Compensation Act, a

is the point .

sc, they are not covered by this platform.

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. BROWN;

I understand.
Cne other thing

that I would like

24

to mention.

There is an argument by Gray's counsel to

25

the effect that somehow there is an extension of the

23

1

Outer Continental Shelf lands Set

2

I suggest to the Court that that is a

3

meritless issue, because the Fifth Circuit had it before

4

it and failed to reach it, and they reached coverage in

5

this case because of their finding that the longshoremen

6

and Harbor Workers Set applied under its own force.

7

I suggest to you that you

will not find any

8

cases on point that deal with this particular issue.

9

There are, as I count them, four cases which talk abcut

10

what the words "as a result of operations" mean, and all

11

of those cases have to do with flights to and from the

12

platform either on seaplanes or helicopters, and I think

13

the result in these cases are correct.
Your Honor, I would like to reserve whatever

MR. BROWN:

Thanh ycu, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court.
There is no doubt that in

one .

But because cf the combination of the injury

6

in territorial waters and the fixed platform situs, the

7

issue becomes a questicn abcut whether Gray is entitled

8

to longshoremen’s benefits.

9

In locking at status, it is necessary to

10

examine

the nature and purpose of Gray's activities,

11

whether those activities have a significant connection

12

to maritime navigation or commerce, and whether the

13

purpose cf the activities was to facilitate maritime

14

commerce.
In Caputc, the Court noted that with respect

15
16

to landward extension the language of the '72 amendments

17

is broad, and suggests that the Court should take an

18

expansive view cf the extended coverage, as well as the

19

focus on maritime connected nature and purpose cf the

20

job rather than the location also serves this particular

21

purpose.

22

Focusing on Gray's work, the map introduced in

23

evidence during the administrative proceedings depicts

24

the number cf platforms existing in both state and CCS

25

waters, and

Gray was responsible for welding maintenance

49

1

work on all these platforms, and was required daily to

2

travel among them in the performance of his duties.

3

On some days, he would have to travel to

4

perhaps two or three or four platforms, and on ether

5

days he would have work duties on, for example, like the

6

E structure of the platform where he was hurt. He was on

7

that for approximately three or four days.
But in any event, he would have to be

where he was housed daily.
