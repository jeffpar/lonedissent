It fails to accord the respect to the federal

We would ask the Court to provide much-needed

clarificaticn to the lower courts in this regard by

reiterating that the position of Witherspoon and his

progeny is that a prospective juror may be excused fcr

2

cause when his capital punishment views are such that he

3

is unable or unwilling to fellow along in the court's

4

instruction;

5

employed either by the questioner or by the answer given

6

by the prospective juror; that a juror is required tc

7

assure the trial judge that he can follow the law cr

8

else he will be excused for cause based on his views;

9

and that because of the unique advantage occupied by the

that there is rc necessary formula tc be

10

11

jury is saying and means, that wide latitude should be

12

given his determinations.

13

Very briefly, the facts in this case which

14

brought this tc a head, Johnny Paul Witt was tried and

15

convicted of the first degree murder of Jonathan Kushner

16

and received a sentence of death.

17

During the vcir dire examination of one of the

18

jurors, Juror Colby, the prosecutor inquired as to

19

whethe cr net the juror had any particular beliefs

20

against capital punishment.

21

she had some personal views and the prosecutor followed

22

that up with a series of questions*

23

The juror responded that

We believe that the appropriate test for

15

habeas corpus in reviewing collateral attacks,

16

Witherspoon claims, is the presumption of correctness

17

outlined in 2254 D of section Title 28.

18

The policy reasons for this include the

19

traditional values of comedy and federalism which have

20

been enunciated in previous proceedings in this Court.

21

Going tack to Stone v. Powell,

22

that state judges are fully capable of applying

23

constitutional standards, and they take the same oath tc

24

uphold the Constitution as do the federal judges.

25

this Court has announced

11

prior decisions of this Court which have most recently

12

recognized the importance that should be given to trial

13

judges in making their determinations on matters of fact

14

which they are better equipped to resolve.

15

Most of these values which I’ve just

enunciated, of course,

greater opportunity of a trial judge to observe the

2

demeanor and credibility of a juror in responding to

3

leading questions, listening to the tone of the

responses given, that greater deference should be given

5

to the trial judge's determination.

15

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't 24 C, evidence by a

18

written finding, written option, or other reliable and

19

20

ME. LANDEYs

Other reliable adequate written

21

indicia, we submit, is the transcript of the trial,

22

including the questions and answers, the questions

23

propounded by the prosecutor, the answers given, the

24

opportunity for the defense counsel to object and ask

25

further clarifying questions, and the trial judge's

7

1

statement, his ruling at that point, we submit, is an

2

adequate written indicia.

3

It's more or less similar to the situation, we

4

think, in Novelli v. Dellarose in which the trial judge

5

was called upon to make a determination as tc the

6

voluntariness of the confession.

7

trial judge did not articulate his credibility finding

QUESTION:

All he said was, "All right, step

8

1

HR. LANDRY:

2

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
Well, does your reading of the

3

statute, then, really make the words "evidence ty a

4

written finding, a written opinion," superfluous,

5

because there’s always a transcript, I suppose.

6

a transcript is all the statute contemplates.
NR. LANDRY;

7

Ycu say

I don't think that is

8

superfluous, no.

But I think where we have an

9

indication in the record here that the trial judge

10

correctly understood the appropriate legal standard,

11

then his conclusions, factual conclusions that he

12

utilized to formulate the decision that he did, must be

13

given

respect.
QUESTION:

14

Is it possible that the trial judge

15

hearing this examination of the potential juror respond

16

at least four times, saying, "I'm afraid, it would,”

17

"Yes,

18

it would," felt that that was so clear that no findings

19

were necessary?

I am afraid it would," "I think sc," and "I think

MR. LANDRY;

20

That's indeed correct, that it

22

Ryder,

23

the fact that defense counsel did not otject, and it was

24

apparently clear to everyone in the courtroom that the

25

juror’s attitude was such that she could not impartially

to further explicate the basis for his ruling by

9

1

decide guilt or inrccer.ce.

2

QUESTION;

But may I ask,

I gather the

3

Witherspoon formulation is that you can remove fcr cause

4

only those who make it — and I'm quoting from

5

Witherspoon — "unmistakably clear that they would

6

automatically vote against the imposition of capital

7

punishment without regard to any evidence that might be

8

developed in the trial in the case before them."

9

Now,

10

satisfies that standard?

11

what is it in that colloquy that you say

MR. LANDRY;

I say that the four responses to

12

the questions propounded by the prosecutor, indicating

13

that her attitude had

14

with the ability to decide guilt or innocence,

15

adequately complies with Witherspoon.

16

QUESTION;

reached a plateau of interfering

I don’t see any reference to guilt

17

or innocence.

18

interfere with you sitting as a juror.

19

What it is is whether that would

QUESTION;

Isn’t one of the questions, would

20

it interfere with the judgment of the guilt or innocence

21

of the defendant in this case?

22

think so."

23

MR. LANDRY;

24

QUESTION;

25

And the answer was,

"I

Yes, sir.
Mr. Landry, let me read you a more

recent formulation of the Witherspoon remark.

10

The case

1

of Adams v. Texas, where the court said this line cf

2

cases has established that a juror may rot be challenged

3

for cause based on his views about capital punishment

4

unless those views would prevent or substantially impair

5

the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance

6

with his- instructions and his oath.

7

I take it your submission is that the trial

8

judge’s ruling at the close of the colloquy certainly

9

satisfied that standard.

10

KR. LANDRY*

Yes, sir.

To the extent that the

11

lower court believed that there had to be a total

12

conformity to the language cf Footnote 21 in

13

Witherspoon, he was mistaken.

14

certainly indicates that if a juror's views are such

15

that would prevent or substantially impair his

16

performance, he may be excused for cause.

17
18

The restatement in Adams

And, of course, the juror’s response in this
case did meet that criteria.
The error, we believe, of the Eleventh Circuit

19
20

is an emphasis on requiring that there be an exact

21

compliance with Footnote 21 terminology.

22

Eleventh Circuit apparently has held that "interfere

23

with,”

24

impermissibly ambiguous statement.

25

New, the

used by the prosecutor or by trial judge, is an

We do not understand it to be so, and it is

11

1

really cuite unclear as to when that phrase became

2

ambigu ous.

3

For example, at Fcctncte 5 of Witherspoon,

4

this Court appears to have implied

5

"interfere with the ability to determine guilt in

6

accordance with the law and evidence," was

7

interchangeable and synonoious with the phrase used

8

the text, "prevent from making an impartial decision as

9

to guilt."

10

that the phrase,

in

New, if the Court in writing the Witherspoon

11

opinion in Footnote 5 apparently thought or at least

12

implied that the two phrases might be interchangeable,

13

certainly the prosecutor and the trial judge cannot be

14

criticized for similarly regarding the two phrases as

15

the equivalent of each other.

16

In any event, it is clear from the record that

17

there was no complaint by Mr. Witt attacking the alleged

18

ambiguity of the question until some eight years after

19

his trial and some two changes in lawyers after he had

20

gone through his direct appeal, attacking only the

21

response given by the juror, and similarly attacking

22

that response in the Federal District Court, Judge Carr.

23

So, consequently, we submit that the lower

24

court has erred in requiring a strict verbatim

25

compliance with the requirements of Fcctncte 21, and

12

1

that contention that the Eleventh Circuit’s ruling is

2

inconsistent with the subsequently decided case of this

3

Court.

4

In Lockett v. Ohio, for example, this Court

5

did not require a strict reading of Footnote 21.

6

the jurors were asked whether or not they could take an

7

oath tc well and truly try the case, despite their views

8

on capital punishment.

9

question led to their excusal.

10

And negative answers to

There,

that

Sc we submit that it is net really the form of

11

the question or the answer that is significant, but

12

simply the total context of what the response given is

13

as to whether a juror is able and willing to conform wth

14

the law or not.

15

We think the Eleventh Circuit has erred in its

16

determinations, and that this case is exactly the same

17

as Adams v. Texas.

18

distinguishable from Adams.

19

the requirement under Texas law that someone take an

20

oath that he would not be affected at all in his

21

determinations of any question of fact based on his

22

views of capital punishment.

23

We submit that this case is clearly
Adams was a case involving

He was not asked or gave no -- it did not

24

matter whether or not he could follow the law; it did

25

not matter that he could set aside whatever his views

13

were.

If they had any kind cf effect at all cn his

fact-finding deliberations by his capital punishment
views,

he was excused and apparently could not even be

rehabilitated.
Sc the State of Florida does not ask or
require anyone not tc be affected by capital
punishment.

We simply insist that a juror be willing tc

assure the trial judge that he can follow the law and
follow the instruction of the court and follow the law
on the evidence.
If he is net willing tc give that assurance,
then we submit that he is properly excused for cause
under Icckett v. Adams.
QUESTION:

We ask this Court to —

Well, if a juror were to say the

juror was opposed to capital punishment but nevertheless
could decide the case based on the evidence and the
instructions, would that give rise to any excuse fer
cause cn the part of the State?
MR. LANDRY:

No, ma’am.

If the juror can

follow the'law and according tc the instructions given
and the evidence adduced at court, then he should not be
excused.

And Florida dees not insist that he should

be.
I would like to reserve the remaining time for
my rebuttal.

QUESTION;

Well, how does that bear on his

failure to raise it in the trial court?

3

MR. MC LAIN;

His failure to raise it in the

4

trial court — the Florida Supreme Court addressed this

5

question on the merits.

6

QUESTION;

Yes.

I realize that there is a

proper basis for finding that there has been no

12

words,

13

14

and ask some questions yourself?

that a question on voir dire by the prosecutor is

don't you have seme obligation if you're going to
to try to focus on the question

15

This defense counsel just stood mute.

16

MR. MC LAIN:

That’s correct, Your Honor, and

17

I think his statement in the deposition explains whyv

18

that he was unfamiliar with the Witherspoon standard at

19

the time he selected the jury.
QUESTION;

20

Dees that bear on his obligation,

21

if the point is later to be made, eight years later in

22

the case,

23

proper, that he ought to do something about it then?

24
25

that a particular question on voir dire wasn’t

MR. MC LAIN;

Yes, Your Honor.

I’m just

saying as an explanation of perhaps why he didn’t do

16

1

anything and why it can't be indicative of a demeanor

2

finding in the trial court on his part for failing to

3

object.

4

unmistakably clear, because he was not aware of the

5

Witherspoon standard at that time.

We can’t say that he perceived it as being

QUESTION;

6

No, but it’s the judge who has to

7

-- and I think the Adairs language doesn’t really use the

8

words

9

views about capital punishment, unless those views would

"unmistakably clear.”

It says, "based on his

10

prevent or substantially impair the performance of his

11

duties as a juror. "

12
13
14

That’s really a mere recent formulation and
it’s in the text rather than the footnote.
MR. MC LAIN:

I think Adams v. Texas really

15

controls this decision because the term "interfere" as

16

used in his questions in this case suffers the same flaw

17

as did the term "affect" in the questions used in the

18

Texas case.

19

QUESTION;

Do you think if the court or the

20

district court had made findings, that could have

21

remedied this problem?

22

the absence of findings irrelevant?

23

MR. MC LAIN:

Or the absence of findings, is

The absence — I don’t think the

24

Witherspoon question, whether Witherspoon questions are

25

treated as ones involving historical fact, accorded the

17

1

presumption of correctness under 2254 E, is really

2

relevant to deciding this case at all, because even

3

under the terms of 2254 D, the pertinent fact for

4

dispute was not decided.

5

this case, either explicit findings or implicit findings.

6
7

Consequently, the issue, the applicability of
2254 D , is not presented in this case.

8
9

We have no findings of fact in

QUESTIONi

If the district judge,

the trial

judge had thought that some findings were either

10

necessary or helpful, dc you suppose he might have teen

11

dissuaded from making them by the fact that there was no

12

objection tc the excusing cf this juror?
ME. MC LAIN;

13
14

Your Honor.

I can only speculate.

QUESTION;

15

That may have been the case,

Well,

what’s your answer to your

16

adversary's argument that if challenge for cause was

17

sustained, that that action in and of itself carries

18

with it findings?
ME. MC IAIN;

19

I don’t think this record is

20

capable of demonstrating an implicit finding of fact.

21

First,

22

court used the correct legal standard in excusing Juror

23

Colby for cause.

24
25

because there is no indication that the trial

We cannot infer a finding of fact where there
is no clear legal standard employed.

18

We don't know

1

whether the trial judge was operating under the correct

2

Witherspoon standard, for a number of reasons*.

3

one was not articulated at the time Juror Colby was

4

excused.

5

court was using the correct legal standard because of

6

the state of Florida law at the time.

Furthermore, we cannot presume that the trial

In Florida,

7

first,

1969 deciscn, Williams v. State,

8

the Florida court adopted an erroneous interpretation of

9

the Witherspoon standard from the New Jersey case, State

10

v. Mathis, which would allow the excusal of jurors for

11

cause precisely because their responses to the inquiry

12

were equivocal.
The Florida court adopted that rule in

and appeal, the Florida court is perhaps still laboring

under this erroneous rule.

20

v.

21

the Florida Supreme Court decision.

22

As recently as 198C in Erown

State, the rule was again quoted and articulated in

The court ruled in this case solely upon

23

prosecutor’s inquiry, solely upon the ambiguous

24

questions, which did net employ the correct legal

25

standard under Adams.

19

1

2

QUESTION:

Well, dees that imply that the

judge didn't know the right standard?

3

MR. MC LAIN:

It implies the judge did net, by

4

acting upon the prosecutor's inquiry alone

5

comply

6

which did not

with the Witherspoon standard.
QUESTION:

The answers to a question might

7

give the judge what he thought anyway was enough

8

evidence to apply the correct standard.

9

MR. MC LAIN:

I don't -- it would not in this

10

case because of the nature of the questions.

11

"interfere" — and I think we have to focus on how the

V

25

QUESTION:

There is language, though,

20

as was

1

pointed cut by Mr. Landry,

2

the word "interfere,” where the Court said courts and

3

other states have sometimes permitted the exclusion for

4

cause of jurors opposed to the death penalty, even in an

5

absence cf a showing that their scruples wculd have

6

interfered with their ability tc determine guilt and so

7

forth.
There is discussion using the word

8

9

in Witherspoon itself, using

"inter fered."
KB. MC LAIN:

10

Yes, Your Honor.

Again I say

11

the term has to be evaluated in the manner in which it

12

might reasonably be construed by a juror.
And it is subject to differing

13
14

interpretations.

Some of those interpretations —

QUESTION^

15

Did the court below give any

16

deference, or did it treat this as a mixed question cf

17

law and fact?

18

MR. MC LAIN;

Your Honor, the court below

19

noted that there was some uncertainty in the lower

20

courts.

Footnote 10 of the opinion --

21

QUESTION;

22

MR. MC LAIN;

23

The court conducted an

independent review of the record.

24
25

Sc what standard did it apply?

QUESTION;
that's

Well, now let's assume we decide

wrong/ that it's really entitled to a presumption

21

1

of correctness because it's a historical fact, like

2

bias.

And suppose --

3

HE. MC LAIN:

4

QUESTION!

5

I don’t —

We don’t need to argue whether

that’s right or wrong.

6

Suppose we decide that they applied the wrong

7

standard to this case?

8

them review it under the correct standard?

9

MR. MC LAINi

Shouldn't we remand it and have

Well, in Footnote 10 of their

10

opinion, they noted the uncertainty regarding the

11

standard to be employed in reviewing findings of fact in

12

the Witherspoon context.

13

that even under the least rigorous standard, the 2254 D

14

standard, that they would have reached the same results,

15

and for the reasons that there were no findings made b

16

the trial court.

17
18

QUESTIONi

However, they went on to say

Did ycu try this case, Mr. McLain?

Were ycu trial counsel?

19

MR. MC LAINi

I was not trial counsel in the

20

state court.

I was co-counsel in the district court,

21

and I was counsel in the court of appeals.
QUESTIONi

22

Well, when defense counsel are so

23

anxious to have a person on the jury who expresses

24

reservations such as are made here in at least four

25

responses,

does that tell us anything about whether

22

1

defense counsel wants people with these reservations on

2

j uries?

3

ME. MC LAIN;

4

QUESTION;

I’m sorry, Your Honor?

Is that a totally unbiased juror?

5

That’s the question.

A juror who says it would

6

interfere with judging the guilt or innocence.
MR. MC LAIN;

7

The Witherspoon standard

8

requires the state to make an affirmative showing that

9

the juror is, in fact, impartial.

When there is ar.

10

ambigucus showing of whether the juror is impartial,

11

then Witherspoon does not permit the exclusion of that

12

juror.

13

If the jurcr were unable to answer -QUESTION;

Your position here is that the

14

response that it wculd interfere with judging the guilt

15

or innocence of the defendant shows no bias?

16

MR. MC LAIN;

It perhaps shews an uncertainty

17

regarding the position of the juror, but it does not

18

make unmistakably clear that the juror would be

19

prevented from —

20
21

22

QUESTION:

Well, you really have to read

Witherspoon in light of Adams, too, don’t you?
MR. MC LAIN:

Yes, Ycur Honor.

I think again,

23

we go right back to the possible interpretations of the

24

term "interfere,” and the possible interpretations the

25

jurors could reasonably impose upon that term.

23

1

QUESTION;

Of course, the trial judge has the

2

benefit that no reviewing court can have of the demeanor

3

evidence of the witness.

4

ambiguity on the record may, in the view of the trial

5

judge,

6

convey quite a different mode.

What seems to perhaps suggest

in view of facial expressions or tone of voice,

7

HE. MC LAIN;

That’s correct, Your Honor, and

8

we are net contending that there should be absolutely nc

9

deference paid to any pertinent demeanor findings made

10

by a trial court, even —

11

QUESTION;

Well, are you saying that if a

12

trial court -- supposing a challenge is underway for

13

bias, not on the Witherspoon ground, but just on the

14

grounds that the witness is biased against the

15

plaintiff.

16

biased

17

And the defense lawyer conducts — or is

against the defendant.
The prosecutor conducts voir dire.

18

defendant coducts voir dire.

19

says the witness is excused for cause.

20

The

And the trial judge then

Are you suggesting that to comply with 2254 D,

21

the trial .judge would have to go further and say the

22

reason I am excusing this juror for cause is that I

23

disbelieve some of her statements, and also she turned

24

red when she was asked question 3?

25

MR. MC LAIN;

I think certainly 24 — perhaps

24

1

net required for application of 2254 D, in that there

2

could be an implicit finding of fact in that case,

3

provided the correct legal standard was employed.

4

However, when we're dealing with a situation

5

of excusing jurors because cf seme personal bias, we're

6

really dealing with a different standard than we're

7

dealing with in the Witherspoon context.

8

Witherspoon context, we're talking about a iruch. hicher

9

standard and an affirmative showing on the part of the

In the

10

State regarding the juror’s beliefs and the impact cf

11

those beliefs on the ability to judge the case

12

impartially.

13

In excusing a juror because of seme personal

14

bias, it's really a negative shewing there as opposed to

15

an affirmative showing.

16

Witherspoon standard is — part of the constitutional

17

standard established in Witherspoon is a higher standard

18

for excusal for cause because it’s excusing a class cf

19

jurors based upon their beliefs, as opposed to an

20

individual juror based upon some personal bias.

21

And, furthermore, the

I would note that I think

the Eleventh Circuit

22

Court of Appeals has, in a later case, after this

23

decision -- the Darden case — articulated what is

24

perhaps the correct standard of review in the

25

Witherspoon questions.

25

1

An independent review of the record to ensure

2

that the correct Witherspoon standard has teen

3

faithfully met and satsified but, at the same time,

4

recognizing that, where appropriate, some deference

5

should

6

balance between the Witherspoon standard and the need to

7

ensure that that legal standard is appropriately

8

complied with and with the need to give appropriate

9

deference to demeanor findings by the state trial

10

be given to trial court findings.

This strikes a

court.

11

QUESTION:

Mr. McLain, is the underlying

12

purpose of the holding in Witherspoon simply to prevent

13

the State from excusing for. cause jurors who are opposed

14

to capital punishment?

IS

sufficient to find an excuse for cause.

That that enough isn't

But Is there anything in Witherspoon that says

16
17

if a juror is found to be biased on the question of

18

finding guiltor innocence, either way, that that juror

19

should net be excused?
In other words, if a

20

juror, a trial

21

prospective juror, is determined to be biased on the

22

question of finding guilt or innocence, the juror is

23

unable

24

decide the case based on the evidence, is there anything

25

in Witherspoon that prevents excusing such a juror for

to follow the court’

instructions or unable to

26

1

cause

in ycur view?

2

MR. MC LAIN;

That juror could be excused if

3

that bias was a product of opposition to the death

4

penalty; that under no circumstances —

5

6

QUESTION:

Well,

for whatever reason,

including opposition to the death penalty.

7

MR. MC LAIN:

8

addressing that precise question.

9
10

QUESTION:

I don't recall Witherspoon

Well,

isn't that shat we have here

r eally ?

11

MR. MC LAIN:

No, lour Honor, I don't think

12

that's what we have here, because the nature of the

13

inquiry was focusing directly upon this juror's

14

oppostion to the death penalty.

15

takes shape, then the Witherspoon standard must be

16

a pplie d .

And when that focus

I would note that the standard of review

17
18

articulated by the Eleventh Circuit in the Carden case,

19

while not giving the presumption of correctness to the

20

findings of fact, still does strike the appropriate

21

balance to be made between independent review of the

22

record

23

appropriately applied, and still giving respect due to

24

state court findings.

25

to ensure the Witherspoon standard is

QUESTION:

Suppose a juror says,

27

"Well, I am

1

not iaalterably opposed to the death penalty.

2

believe in it; I would never vote for it if I were a

3

legislator, and I couldn't say that I never would vote

4

to impose the death penalty, but I'll tell you right

5

now, it's very likely to influence the way I decide

6

guilt or innocence.

7

that it would warp my judgment, I think.

8

inevitably, it would."

9

I don't

I mean, I’m opposed enough to it
Just

Now, could that juror be excused, even though

10

his responses to the death penalty questions aren't

11

exactly like Witherspoon?
MR. KC LAIN;

12
13

Under the Witherspoon standard,

that juror could net be excused based upon —
QUESTION!

14

Yes, but how about under some other

15

standard?

16

Witherspoon addressed was hew opposed do you have to be

17

to the death penalty, without any other evidence, to

18

assume

All

that the juror can’t perform?
Here, a juror says, ’’Yes, it will.

19

20

I mean, Witherspoon didn’t address that.

It will.

I'm opposed enough that it will influence my judgment."

21

MR. KC LAIN;

22

QUESTION;

23

ME. KC LAIN;

I think this Court —

"May impair my judgment."
This Court, in Adams v.

Texas,

24

held that those kinds cf feelings, even though the juror

25

could

nevertheless indicate that they could judge the

28

1

case Dn the evidence, but candidly admitted that their

2

beliefs might have seme influence, this Court in Adams

v. Texas said

that jurcr cculd not be excluded under the

QUESTIONi

Dc you think the responses here are

ME. MC LAIN:

Yes, Ycur Honor, I do.

I think

QUESTION:

Questions and responses.

10

inquiry to this potential juror.

11

essentially the same in both cases.

12

MR..SC LAIN:

13

QUESTION:

The

Do you think they are

Essentially the same; yes.

Well,

Mr. Mclain, do you think that

14

Witherspcon at least partially cut tack on the

15

previously established general rule that a juror who

16

said that they could not faithfully follow the court's

17

instructions couldn't sit as a juror?

18

That wasn't my impression.

19

MB. MC LAIN:

No, Your Honor.

I think the the

20

jurors who say they cannot follow the court's

21

instructions or the law in deciding the case would net

22

be permitted to sit as a juror.

23

QUESTION:

Witherspoon simply said, as I

24

understand it, if you're simply excusing people because

25

they're opposed to capital punishment, you're excusing a

29

1

group of people who are entitled to sit on the jury;

2

unless you would gc further and say no, because of that

3

belief they couldn’t follow the court's instructions.

4

Sc the general principle is, if you can’t

5

follow the court’s instructions on the law, you can be

6

excuse d.

7

MR. MC LAIN;

That’s correct, Your Honor.

8

However, it must be an affirmative showing by the State

9

before the excusal is proper.

10

QUESTION;

Well, in fact, doesn't the Sixth

11

Amendment and due process probably require unbiased

12

jurors on the guilt/innocence question?

13

separate constitutional requirement?

14

MR-. MC LAIN;

15

QUESTION;

16

MR. MC LAIN;

QUESTION;

Of unbiased

Isn’t that a

jurors?

Yes.
Well, certainly the —

On the question of guilt and

innocence.
MR. MC LAIN;

Certainly, the defendant is

20

entitled to an unbiased jury.

21

QUESTION;

And isn’t it a question of fact for

22

the trial judge to determine whether a particular

23

prospective

24
25

juror is unbiased?

MR. MC LAIN;

It is a determination for the

trial judge to make, of course, whether a juror is

30

1

biased or not biased, cr whether a juror, as in this

2

case,

3

that’s an initial determination by the trial judge.

4

fits under the Witherspoon standard.

QUESTION

Of course,

You sere saying that on this

5

record, those four or five responses, that this did not

6

shew a bias that wculd have affected the judgment cr

7

guilt or innocence?
ME. MC LAIN:

8
9

a bias that would have — perhaps affect it, but again
QUESTIONi

10
11

No, Your Honor, it does not show
—

Then you and I aren’t reading the

same r ecord .
ME. MC LitINs

12

The juror -- the juror indicated

13

that her beliefs, she thought, might interfere.

14

However, she was never asked the question of whether she

15

could set -- sit whatever interference it might pose

16

aside,

17

She was never instructed, in petting her inquiry in a

18

little more context perhaps.

19

and nevertheless follow the law in the evidence.

QUESTION;

And you base this all on the idea

20

that the word "interfere" is so ambiguous that the

21

statement that it wculd interfere with judging the guilt

22

or innocence does not reflect a bias?

23
24
25

ME. MC LAIN;

It dees net reflect an adequate

bias for an excusal under Witherspoon.
QUESTION:

And the answer to that was yes;

31

that it would interfere.

She didn’t have any — the

juror didn't have any difficulty in understanding what
"interfere" meant.
HE. KC LAIN;

We still don't know, we still

can’t glean the interpretation
the word "interfere."

the jurcr was placing on

She may have thought "interfere,"

to the extent of making the decision mere difficult for
her, but nevertheless she could set that — may have
been able tc set that difficulty aside and still the
follow

the evidence and the law of the case, and decide

the case impartially.
I think anytime we're dealing with jurors,
human

beings are going to have factors or variables

that's geing tc make certain decisions less ccirfcrtatle
for them to make, and that's inherent in the jury
system .
But that is not a reason for excluding the
jurcr,

just because the decisionmaking process may be

made uncomfortable fer them.
QUESTION;

Well, what if the juror, on voir

dire, discloses that, — for instance, in this case Miss
Colby disclosed that her brother was a policeman whe'd
beer, injured in the line of duty, and her brother-in-law
was a county prosecutor at one time, and she responds in
answer tc a question abcut whether that would interfere

32

1

with her sitting as a trial juror in the case, she

2

responds, "Hell, I think it would, actually.

3

it would interfere with my ahility to judge the guilt or

4

inn cce nee."

5
6
7

I'm afraid

Do you think the defendant would have a right
to excuse that juror for cause?
ER. MC LAIN;

I think only if the defendant --

8

excusal for cause would be appropriate only if the

9

defendant could establish that that interference would

10

prevent from her --

11

QUESTION;

Well, on that exchangev is that

12

enough, do you think?

13

if that had been denied you, that the court should have

14

excused that juror for cause?

15

Wouldn't you be in here arguing

MR. MC LAIN;

That -- again, the inability of

16

the juror to nevertheless fellow the law has not teen

17

established by the inquiry.

18

in that juror's background which would create difficult

19

in deciding

20
21

22
23
24
25

Certainly there are things

the case.

QUESTION;

When the juror says,

"Look, it will

interfere with my ability to judge guilt or innocence.”
QUESTION;

How else do you establish, other

than by a statement of the juror?
MF. MC LAIN;

That's correct, Your Honor, and

I think we still, going back to the inquiry in this

33

1

case,

2

ambiguity, both in the questions and

ne just -- we can't determine, because of the

3

QUESTION;

the responses.

How much more do you have to ask?

4

You ask the juror, well, what do you mean

5

"Well, I would be more likely to find the defendant

6

guilty than someone whc hasn't had these experiences."

7

Is that enough?

8

ME. MC LAIN:

9

QUESTION;

10

That might very well be enough.

Might?

ME. MC LAIN;

I think that would probably be a

11

basis for excusing the juror.

12

appropriate Witherspoon -QUESTION;

13

"interfere"?

But again, the

Wouldn't that be the inference that

14

you would draw from the juror's statement,

15

interfere with my — these kinds of experiences would

16

interfere with my finding guilt or innocence"?

17

ME. MC LAIN;

"It would

We still come back to the

18

question,

19

necessarily mean to each and every juror responding to

20

such a

22

"intefere" simply does not' mean, or

question, prevent the ability to follow the law

And we also have a different situation when

23

we're talking about the State excusing a juror under the

24

Witherspoon standard and the defense's position of

25

excusing a juror under some ether personal bias

34

2

I think the Witherspoon standard was imposed

3

upon the State to assure that an inappropriate,

overbroad restriction of the jury pool does not occur.
