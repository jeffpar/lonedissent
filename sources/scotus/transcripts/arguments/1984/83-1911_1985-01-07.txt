ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SCHOEMAN;

8

9

Mr. Schoeman, you may proceed

please

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

the Court;
The issue in this case is whether publishers

10
11

of disinterested information and opinion about

12

securities may be prohibited from publishing on the

13

ground

14

Advisers Act as investment advisers.

15

Petitioners' right to publish cn a matter of legitimate

16

public interest is guaranteed by the First Amendment to

17

the Constitution and that the Act as applied to

18

publishers is an unconstitutional system of licensing of

19

the financial press.

20

that they are not registered under the Investment
We say that

The facts are not in dispute.

The Petitioners

21

are publishers and that is their only activity.

22

publish newsletters that are distributed to subscribers

23

by mail, and these publications contain information

24

about the stock market, recommendations and opinions and

25

facts about specific securities.

There is no evidence of any personal contact

with any readers, no evidence of any personal advice or

publications is fraudulent or misleading or untruthful.

The only ground on which Petitioners are to be

enjoined is that they are not registered under the Act.

At one point —

10

QUESTIONS

hr. Schoeman , you did not petition

11

on the basis of an argument raised below, which was that

12

Mr. Lowe was exempt from the previsions of the Act; is

13

that correct?

14

M3. SCHOEMANs

That's correct.

We believe

15

that, unfortunately, Capital Cains Pesearch Bureau, in

16

think it's 375 U.S., resolved the question of whether an

17

impersonal publisher is subject to the Act, and we felt

18

that that was controlling.

19
20

QUESTION;

I

I guess maybe that question might

be open in this Court?

21

ME. SCHOEMAN;

22

QUESTION;

«ell, it's --

I mean, if we decided the exemption

23

question and determined that the Act didn't cover this

24

type of publication or that it was exempt, then we

25

wouldn't reach the constitutional issue, is that

corree t?

2

MR. SCHOEMAN;

3

QUESTION*

That is correct.

Do we have an obligation, then, to

4

consider that in an effort to avoid the constitutional

5

issue?
MR. SCHOEMAN

6

i

Yes, I think the Court should

7

do everything it can to avoid reaching the

8

constitutional question.
QUESTION*

9
10

And yet you didn't raise it.

Are

you satisfied that there is no exemption under the Act?
MR. SCHOEMAN*

11

I den't think that the

12

Petitioners necessarily feel that they can only exercise

13

their rights if they publish on a regular basis.

14

Petitioners have a right to publish a book, for example,

15

containing the same information, and yet that doesn't

16

come within the terms of the exception.
I would think the real problem with Capital

17
18

Gains Research Bureau I think is that it misread the

19

legislative history.

20

legislative history, particularly the excerpt from the

21

House report that we quote on page 7 of our brief, it is

22

ci^ar,

23

regulate was the personalized services of investment

24

advisers, because that's what they said.

25

T think when you read the

to me at least, that what Congress was trying to

And it's also true that in the SEC study on

given to publications that distribute to you personally

3

by mail.
QUESTION*

4
5

the Act is based there really was no consideration

Are we dealing here with regular

publications, though?
MR. SCHOEMAN*

6

Well, that's an unclear

7

question, because Congress didn't really define what

8

"regular" means.
QUESTION i

9
10

Well,

tut I'm talking about the

publications of Mr. Lowe.
MR. SCHOEMAN :

11

Well, Mr. Lowe’s publications

12

are scheduled on a regular basis, but they haven't been

13

published on a regular basis.

14

QUFSTIONj

15

(Laughter. )

16

HR. SCHOEMAN*

17

I would -- I think what Capital Gains failed

Like law reviews.

Yes, sir.

18

to do is to interpret the statute in the light of the

19

First

20

because it wasn't argued there, apparently.
QUESTION*

21

22

Amendment problems that that case was creating,

But

you're client is covered?

23

ME. SCHOEMAN*

24

QUESTION;

25

you're bound by that case,

door,

That's right.

What if he had gone out door to

office to office, in the typical way dealers would

(202) 628-9300

1

engage in their activity of not only advising, but

2

selling securities, after all of his licenses had teen

3

revoked?

4
5

Could a court enjoin that activity?
M3. SCHOEMAN;

If he went doer to door selling

his publication?
QUESTIONS

6

Well, usually they did it by

7

telephone, but that he continued doing just what he had

8

done as a dealer after his license had been revoked.

9

Now, that includes a great deal of verbal activity,

10

doesn * t it?
MR. SCHOEMAN:

11
12

QUESTION;

No, net the publication.

I’m

talking about securities.
MR. SCHOEMAN;

15
16

If all he was doing was

selling the publication --

13
14

Yes.

Ah, if he were selling

securi ties.
QUESTION;

17

I'm moving away.

He’s acting as a

18

dealer, selling securities, advising people and selling

19

securities, calling them on the phone, having

20

conferences with them,

21

then his license is revoked and he continues, and the

22

court enjoins him.

just as any dealer does.

And

Can the court enjoin his First Amendment

23
24

right,

as you put it, to speak to these customers and

25

potential customers?
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

MR. SCHOEMAN :

1

I think that if his talking to

2

the customers and giving them literature is still part

3

of his effort to engage in the selling and buying of

4

securities, then it's very much in the nature of

5

promotional advertising, I think, in which he is

6

promoting securities and his objective is to get people

7

to make purchases through him.
I think that it then comes within the analysis

8
9

of Eolger against Youngs Drug Products, for example, in

10

which some of the material was informational and yet the

11

objective of the material was to get people to use the

12

product that was involved there.
QUESTION;

13

Well,

what if your client in this

14

case had given personal advice to a group of potential

15

purchasers on a one to one basis, but it was not

16

published, bu1- it was nonetheless nothing that he

17

intended to get any'prcfit out of?

18

commissions for any stock that was sold.
MR. SCHOEMAN:

19

20

He would not get any

Well, the Act itself requires

that the activity be dene for compensation.
QUESTION*

21

Well, but I mean he would bill

22

them,

23

24

shares .

25

you know, a certain amount an hour and say, given

MR. SCHOEMAN:

I think if an individual gives

(202) 628-9300

1

a speech at a public meeting at which he is giving his

2

own opinions, he is protected by the First Amendment.

3

The distinction would be whether he solicited or

4

obtained specific questions from people about their

5

personal situations, because at that point he would then

6

start rendering personalized advice to people.
QUESTION;

7

8

But of course that's nonetheless

HR. SCHQEhAN;

9

Yes, it is.

And it's just a

10

distinction it seems to me that's been drawn.

11

are regulated, even though many of them just give advice

12

and perform no services in court, for example.

13

think the basis of the distinction is that the lawyer is

14

addressing only the specific interests of his client.

15

He's talking just about his client's needs and he has

16

entered into a dialogue with his client.

Lawyers

And

I

i

A publisher doesn't know what his client's

17
18

needs are.

19

possibly by name where there's a subscription list.

20

He’s expressing his own views, and it's up to the

21

readers and the public at large to determine whether

22

that piece of advice fits their situation or does not.

23

He doesn't know who his readers are, except

QUESTION;

I can see the factual difference,

24

but why does that .make a difference when you're

25

interpreting the First Amendment?

(202) 628-9300

MR. SCHOEMAN:

1

Because the First Amendment I

2

think is certainly concerned with public discussion.

3

alsc reaches private speech when that private speech is

4

for compensation.

5

of regulation of these kinds of communications as

6

professions, and I suppose that there could be all

7

manner of professions.

We have a tradition in this country

But there has to be a line drawn between

personalized communication to individual persons based

10

on their needs and public discussion.

case,

It

that all Congress needs tc do is professionalize a

And that's what this Act has done.

It's an

17

attempt by Congress to select a particular subject

18

matter in which Congress has an interest and to say that

19

only certain people are to be permitted to discuss that

20

subject matter.

21

QUESTION:

Would you agree that every

22

disbarment or suspension of a lawyer from practice has

23

some collision with the First Amendment propositions

24

that you’re advancing?

25

MR. SCHOEHAN:

It doesn't have any collision
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

with the lawyer's or the disbarred lawyer's right to

2

publis h.

3

QUESTION:

Well, to speak.

4

MR. SCHOEMAN:

The thing that the lawyer --

5

the lawyer is not prevented, I think, from advising

6

people if he doesn't hold himself out to be a lawyer or

7

if he doesn’t accept compensation.

8

but there is a restriction cn the lawyer's right -QUESTION:

9

He can still speak,

I should have made my hypothetical,

10

my question, a little more clearly.

11

disbarment interfere with the lawyer's right to speak to

12

clients for compensation and fees?
MR. SCHOEMAN;

13
14

Yes, it does.

But it does

not -QUESTION:

15
1G

Doesn't the

And how do you distinguish that

from this situation?
MR. SCHOEMAN:

17

Because it dees not interfere

18

with that lawyer's or ex-lawyer's right to publish a law

review article on how to comply with the takeover

20

statute.

California to publish a newsletter to subscribers

interpreting recent decisions say of the Supreme Court

3

of California, or trends in California law, and collect

4

from them on an individual basis for it?

5

HR. SCHOEMAN:

6

QUESTION:

7

Well then, a disbarred lawyer in

California could do the same thing?
MR. SCHOEMAN:

8
9

Absolutely.

Yes, sir.

What he can't do is

advise people based on their specific situations.

He

10

cannot evaluate whether Mr. X should have a will or

11

shouldn't have a will, or should have an inter vivos

12

trust or shouldn’t.

13

But he can, like Mr. Dacey in New York County

14

Lawyers against Dacey, publish a book which says people

15

should

16

17

have inter vivos trusts in order to avoid

This question has come up.

Every time it's

18

come up in state supreme courts it’s been decided on the

19

basis of the distinction that I'm suggesting here.

20

Personalized communication based on the individual

21

situation of a client is subject to reaulaticn, but

22

publication to the public in general not based on the

23

particular situation of readers --

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Schoeman, can a

non-lawyer publish how-to-do-it forms telling people how

to tailor their own situation to, for instance, get

2

their own divorce or probate their own will?

3

MR. SCHOEMAN:

4

QUESTION:

Certainly.

And furnish the forms and describe

5

how you can do that for yourself?

6

MR. SCHOEMANi

7

QUESTION;

8

MR. SCHOEMAN;

9

QUESTION:

10

Yes.

Even though you're not licensed?
Yes.

And the same with a medical

practice?

11

MR. SCHOEMAN:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

As a non-licensed physician, you

13

can publish directions to people as to how to treat

14

their illness?

15

MR. SCHOEMANi

That's right, because the

16

legislature can't say that certain subjects are fit for

17

public discussion and certain subjects are not.

18

I rely on Mr. Lowe's newsletter or someone else's

19

newsletter cr I rely on my broker or who I rely on,

discussion.

22

Whether

Congress cannot cut off public

It can, based on a long tradition of

23

regulating of professions, limit and control to some

24

extent the private rendering of advice to individuals

25

based on their individual circumstances.

the First Amendment protects the circulation of the

convicted of felonies, hasn't he?

MR. SCHOEMAN;

Four times.

And they are felonies

MR. SCHOEMAN;

a disbarred lawyer is chilled

from talking to clients for pay, isn't he?

MR. SCHGEMAK

QUESTION;

i

That's correct.

So that just because this

4

newsletter has several times contained cr regularly

5

contains false reports would be no basis for an

6

injunction ?
MR. SCHOEMAN;

7

That's correct.

In fact,

there

was no finding cr even allegation that it ever contained

9

any false information.
QUESTION;

10
11
12

Well, I know, but that’s not my

questi on.
MR. SCHOEMAN;

But that certainly is what the

13

Court held in Near against Minnesota,

14

something that was regularly published and found to have

15

regularly contained defamatory material, but

16

nevertheless the publication of that newspaper could not

17

be enjoined in the future.

18

that here was

The fact that someone commits a wrong in the

19

past or several wrongs doesn't tell you what it is he's

20

going to publish tomorrow.

21

QUESTION;

May I ask a question that's

22

prompted by Justice Erennan's question.

Am I correct

23

that the only administrative order was the one that

24

cancelled his registration?

25

order directing him not to publish these papers?

There's no administrative

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

It's

1

the result of separate litigation?
ME. SCHOEMAN;

2

Yes, but may I qualify.

The

3

SEC's order revoked the registration of Lowe Management

4

Corporation, which is one of the Petitioners, and it

5

ordered that Mr. Lowe not be associated with any

6

investment adviser in the future.
QUESTION;

7

8

that he is being associated with now?
ME. SCHOEMAN;

9
10

And whe is the investment adviser

Well, it’s the other

Petitioners.

11

QUESTION;

The corporate entities?

12

ME. SCHOEMANs

13

QUESTION;

Yes.

And so presumably, even if there

14

had been no criminal violations of any kind, they could

15

be enjoined from publishing these papers because they

16

are acting as investment advisers and they're not

17

registered, is that right?
ME. SCHOEMAN;

18

As the statute apparently

19

reads,

20

never had any administrative action taken against them.

21

They simply

22
23

for two of the corporate Petitioners they have

QUESTIO \';

Had they ever qualified as

investment advisers?

24

ME. SCHOEMAN;

25

No, they never attempted to.

Well then, I'm not quite clear on

(202) 628-9300

1

the relevance of the criminal proceeding.

2

any different than if just some stranger who had never

3

been an investment adviser started to publish these

4

papers ?
MR. SCHOEMAN*

5

Is the case

The relevance of the criminal

6

proceeding is to demonstrate to the Court how we fit

7

directly under the disqualifications of the statute.
QUESTION*

8
9

But the net effect of all that is

that they justify the revocation of your registration.

10

And why is that legally any different than if you had

11

never even applied for registration?
MR. SCHOEMAN*

12
13

Legally it is not, since we

didn't have to apply for registration.
QUESTION*

14

If that's true, then is the

15

criminal proceeding even relevant?

16

puzzle d .

MR. SCHOEMAN*

I’m a little

the criminal proceeding is

relevant just to shew that we fit within the statute,

19

that's all, in terms of the disqualifications.

20

QUESTION:

Sc you fit within it because you're

21

Well, it might be that someone who just

22

starts a newsletter without registering, it may be that

23

he might be treated different constitutionally than

MR. SCHOEMAN:

QUESTION:

I don’t —

I would think the Government’s

3

argument would equally fit the person who starts a

4

newsletter without registration and he has r.o criminal

5

record.
MR. SCHOEMAN :

6

That is correct.

That is

7

correct, because this Act applies to all publishers

8

except for those who have been exempted under the

9

statute.

10

And apparently there are some 500 cf their who

are registered.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SCHOEMAN:

13

Who are registered.
I'm sorry, Mr. Justice, I

didn’t hear you.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SCHOEMAN:

16

It seems to us that this statute is an amalgam

17

of the worst features that the Court has identified ever

18

the years in connection with First Amendment licensing.

19

It's based on status, it’s got a great degree of

20

discretion.

21

among different kinds of publications.

Yes.

MR. SCHOEMAN:

Because it's the manipulation,

The speech in that

his other activities.

MR. SCHOEMAN;

But that's certainly not the case here.

16

That’s correct.

There’s no indication of any such conduct.
It seems to me the Commission’s argument

18

basically puts nc limit on Congressional power, and all

19

that it comes down to is that Congress thought that

20

there was a good reason for licensing people who talk

MR. SCHOEMANi

I don't think it makes any

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

Very well

Mr* Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
The key to decision in this case is the

7
8

perspective from which it is approached.

The

9

Petitioners would view it as a single dimensional case

10

involving exclusively First Amendment issues.

It’s a

11

perspective that would bring into play cur historical

12

aversion to prior restraints and a perspective which

13

would draw no distinction between, on the one hand, the

14

right of any person to publish to the world at large

15

and, on the other hand, the right of a fiduciary to

16

publish for the benefit of the very group to whom he or

17

she owes the fiduciary obligation.

f

But it is a quite different case if it's

18
19

considered for what it really is, and that is a

20

professional discipline case, because prior restraints

21

of the clearest kind have been upheld by this Court in

22

cases

24

to assure that unworthy persons not serve in certain

11

on an individualized basis for compensation and

12

published advice for compensation.

13

The line marked out by Congress is different.

14

Congress extended the registration requirement to all

15

investment advisers, including those who publish, but it

excluded publishers cf bona fide newspapers, magazines,

or other financial or business publications of general

6

ultimately, it concluded that national regulation cf

7

investment advisory publishers was necessary because of

8

two types of injury that it found to have been caused by

9

unscrupulous publishers in the absence of regulation.

10

The first was harm to investors generally trading in the

market; and the second was direct harm to the individual

12

subscribers caused by the investment advice that they

receiv ed.

14

Even so,

the actual regulatory scheme selected

15

by Congress was a fairly modest one.

16

what it did was its determination that investment

17

advisers are fiduciaries, and this also lies at the core

18

of cur case; that they occupy, as this Court stated in

MR. LEE:

3

There is one difference between

securities brokers and lawyers in my view.

5

if it made such a determination, I think it would lie

6

within the authority of a state legislature to determine

that there is a sufficient fiduciary relationship

between a disbarred lawyer who is giving legal advice of

the kind that you talk about and these general types.

2

merely publish."

3

Now, if that statement is correct that under

4

the First Amendment Government is powerless to regulate

5

those who merely publish, as opposed to those who give

6

in person advice, then Government would have been

7

powerless to do exactly what it did in the Capital Gains

8

case, namely to require the disclosures that were

9

required in that case.

10

And the reason is that, while there is the

11

difference that in this instance what the Government has

12

done is prohibit publication and in Capital Gains it

13

required publication, this Court has made it very clear

14

in cases like the West Virginia flag salute case and the

15

New Hampshire license plate case — this is a direct

16

quote from the license plate case -- that "The First

17

18

the right to refrain from speaking at all."

f

19

So that the line that Congress drew, we

20

submit, is an appropriate one and is a constitutional

21

one, that there is a difference between the

22

effectiveness of requiring Lowe simply to disclose what

23

he has dene in the past and to prohibit him from

publishing at all.

thrust of the position that is taken in the reply brief,

that the power of Government to regulate professionals

20

is limited to the face to face in person context, simply

21

will not wash, because that's exactly what happened in

Capital Gains, this Court did uphold it.

23

Now, I'll grant you that the Court did net

pass in the precise First Amendment issue in that case

because they didn't have to.

MR. SCHOEMAN;

2

I

think the chilling effect

would prohibit that, because it would lead him not to

public ation.
What’s important is is the publication a valid

6
7

thing to be read, is it something that people ought to

8

read or at least ought to have available, or should they

be pushed away from it by chilling effects?

distinguish between the case where a man is committing a
