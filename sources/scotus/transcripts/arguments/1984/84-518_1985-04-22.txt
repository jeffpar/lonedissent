Mr. Solicitor General.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

MR. LEEi

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, this case arises cut of the efforts by the

10

City of Baltimore to enforce its policy of mandatorily

11

retiring some of its firefighters at age 55.
The only issue before this Court is a very

12
13

narrow one, and one that we believe the Court decided

14

two years ago in EEOC versus Wyoming.
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act

15
16

prohibits the federal government, with some exceptions,

17

from employment discrimination based on age regardless

18

of the employee *s age.

19

employers engage in interstate commerce from age

20

discrimination against employees between the ages of 40

21

and 70.

22

It also prohibits other

One of the exceptions for federal employees is

23

contained in a federal civil service statute which

24

provides for mandatory retirement at age 55 for some

25

federal law enforcement officers and firefighters.

It

1

does not apply to those who have not completed 20 years

2

of service, ard the agency has the discretion to grant

3

an extension to age 60.

4

Like the federal government, the City of

5

Baltimore alsc requires some hut not all firefighters to

6

retire at age 55, but its exceptions are different.

7

Baltimore's case, persons «he have attained the rank cf

8

risks, and other exceptions are keyed to whether the

11

individual was or was not in service as of July 1, 1962,

12

and whether he became a member of the retirement system

13

at the time of its establishment.

14

The petitioners are the EEOC and six Baltimore

15

City firefighters who contend that the city's mandatory

16

retirement viclates their rights under the ADEA.

17

city's basic defense is that mandatory retirement is

18

important to the safety of its citizens, who depend upon

19

a physically

20

There are twe basic approaches to the problem

21

of the identification and the elimination from the work

22

force cf those whose performance becomes less effective

23

with increasing age.

24

here, is a presumptive group approach in which all

25

persons are automatically swept out once they reach a

approach, determines ability on an individual basis.

4

The District Court found that in the case of

5

firefighters this is best dene by periodic stress tests

6

which are fairly inexpensive to administer.

7

Now, as its name discloses, the Age

8

Discrimination in Employment Act is an

9

antidiscrimination statute, so that any age-based

10

employment criterion is at the first level of analysis a

11

violation of

the Act.

Nevertheless, Congress has not totally

12

13

prohibited the presumptive approach.

It has provided a

14

narrow exception which permits the mandatory retirement

15

that age 55 is a bona fide occupational qualification

city’s fire department.
On appeal, the majority of the Court of

3

Appeals took no issue with any of the District Court’s

4

factual findings, but reversed solely on the ground that

5

since Congress had selected age 55 as the retirement age

6

for some federal firefighters, Congress has thereby mace

7

a determination as a matter of law that age 55 is a BFCQ

for all firefighters under all circumstances.

QUESTION*

General Lee, did the District Court

10

consider as evidence of either reasonable cause or the

11

city’s belief that its limit was desirable or as

12

evidence of whether the age limit that the city has is

13

reasonably necessary, did the District Court consider

14

the federal policy and the expressions contained in the

15

House report, for example, as some evidence?

16

ME. LEE*

Justice O’Connor, I am reluctant to

17

give an unqualified answer to that question because I am

18

just not sure.

19

fair to say that if the District Court gave it any

20

weight at all, it was minimal.

21

As I read the opinion, I think it is

QUESTION*

Do you think that the District

22

Court could appropriately at least consider what

23

Congress has said as some evidence of those issues?

24
25

MR. LEE*

I think that if I were a District

Judge and it were offered as evidence, I think it would

be admissible as seme evidence.

2

about to discuss, however, I think it is very minimal.

3

For reasons that I am

The holding by the Court of Appeals, the Court

4

of Appeals conceded, that is, its construction of the

5

statute was strongly influenced by its desire to avoid

6

constitutional issues that would otherwise be presented

7

by virtue of this Court's holding in National league of

8

Cities versus Usery.

g

The holding of the Court of Appeals is very

10

narrow, and the only question before this Court is

11

correspondingly narrow.

12

constitutional issue, no issue concerning the standards

13

for a bona fide occupational qualification, and no issue

14

concerning whether the findings of the District Court

15

supporting its holding that there is no BFOQ are clearly

16

erroneous.

17

The case presents no

And contrary to the respondents* brief, the

18

case in its present posture has nothing to do with

19

safety.

20

Congress has made a judgment that age 55 is a BFOQ for

21

all firefighters as a matter of law.

22

independently sufficient reasons why the judgment of the

23

Court of Appeals must be reversed.

24
25

The only question before this Court is whether

had made that judgment, the findings would be beside the

HR. LEE*

That is correct, and that was the

reasoning of

4

the majority said that in the absence of its

determination with regard to that issue, and I am

6

quoting, "we might well be persuaded by the thorough,

T

impeccably reasoned opinion of the District Court."

/

8

9

the Ccurt of Appeals majority, and indeed

The first reason, in our view, that the
judgment of the Court of Appeals has to be reversed is

10

that this issue has already been considered and resolved

11

by this Court in EECC versus Wyoming, and second, even

12

in the absence of this Court’s ruling in that case, the

13

lower court’s judgment is wrong.

14
15
16

QUESTION;

The Court of Appeals then just

plainly misread Wyoming?
HR. LEE;

Is that it?

They not only plainly misread it.

17

Justice Shite, notwithstanding Chief Judge Shifter’s

18

pointing out to them Footnote 17, they didn’t pay any

19

attention, they didn’t even mention it.

20

The issue in this case was net cne of the

21

questions presented in EEOC versus Wyoming, but during

22

the oral argument, the question was posed tc counsel fer

23

both sides whether it might be possible to dispose of

24

the case on the ground that Congress as a matter of law

25

had established age 55 as a EFCQ for all law enforcement

And it was a perfectly proper question,

3

because if the case could have been decided on that

4

ground, then

5

been avoided, because under Wyoming law, game wardens,

whose mandatory retirement was at issue in that case,

7

are law enforcement officers.

General lee, could I interrupt -Yes, surely.

QUESTIONS

— before you get farther into ycur

11

argument, because I just did want to -- have one thing I

12

was a little puzzled about.

13

Is it clear that the primary argument or at

14

least an important argument in the District Court was

15

whether age 55 was the BFOQ?

16

opinion there was a great deal of emphasis on whether

17

the defendants had established age 60 as a BFOQ, and the

18

court seemed to talk about that more than age 55, if I

19

remember correctly, which would, of course, not fit the

20

Congressional determination at all.

21

KR. LEEs

Because as I remember the

That is correct, and in our view

22

what all of this shows is that it needs to be a case to

23

case individualized determination, and the District

24

Court’s determination did refer to age 60 and age 55,

25

and indeed in the case of most, as the record shows, in

And as tc each one cf them, the District Court found,

10

and it isn't contested, that in fact even as of that

11

time their work was not only satisfactory but above

12

average.
The court reached the question in this case in

13
14

EEOC versus Wyoming in the context of its discussion cf

15

the comparative weight of the federal estate interest

16

which under the progeny to Usery was the fourth

Nevertheless, we submit it

reach and decide this issue.

The Court said, "We note that the strength cf

20

the federal interest underlying the Act is not negated

21

by the fact that the federal government happens to

22

impose mandatory retirement on a small class of its own

24
25

"Once Congress has asserted a federal
interest, and once it has asserted the strength of that

interest, ve have no warrant for reading into the ebbs

2

and flows of political decisionmaking a conclusion that

3

Congress was insincere in that declaration and must from

4

that point on evaluate the sufficiency of the federal

5

interest as a matter of law rather than psychological

6

analysis."

7

Moreover, even if the issue had not been

8

decided by this Court two years ago, there is simply no

9

evidence that Congress' retention in 1978 of mandatory

10

retirement at age 55 for some federal employees

11

represents any kind of a judgment concerning age as a

12

bona fide occtpaticnal qualification.

13

What Congress did, quite clearly, in 1978 was

14

based solely cn a desire to expedite passage of the

15

amendments to the ADEA, applying it to federal employees

16

generally, while allowing the Congressional Committees

17

with jurisdiction over particular federal retirement

18

programs the opportunity to review preexisting

19

provisions.

It was basically a matter of the respect for

21

the jurisdiction of other Committees.

18

far as I know, none of them is out of Committee, Justice

Brennan .

20

Before I -- let me just mention this.

The

21

real significance in our opinion of the side by side

22

existence of the civil service statute and the ADEA as

23

an analytical matter is that if Congress had really

24

intended to exempt non-federal firefighters on the same

25

basis as federal firefighters and knew how to do sc.
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

And even if there were room for reasonable

2

doubt as to the correct interpretation, that doubt wculd

3

have to be resolved as long as it is reasonable in favcr

4

of the consistent construction given to this statute by

5

the EECC, because under this Court’s well established

6

precedents dealing with statutory interpretations by the

7

governmental agency that interprets and enforces the

8

statute, the respondent has the burden of showing that

9

its interpretation is the only reasonable one.

10

That is a burden that the respondents have net

11

only not met, they have not even acknowledged.

12

that can be said in criticism of Congress *s performance

13

in this area is that it has followed two different and

14

arguably — net arguably — inconsistent approaches in

15

two different statutes, and it has left the

16

inconsistency in place for seven years, though it has

17

periodically revisited the issue.

18

The most

But consistent or not, the significant point

19

from a legal standpoint is that each of those approaches

20

is constitutionally available to Congress as this Court

21

has squarely held.

22

versus Eradley to employ an age stereotyping mandatory

23

retirement program for its own employees.

24
25

Congress has the power under Vance

And it also has the power under EEOC versus
Wyoming to take exactly the opposite approach, requiring
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

employers engaged in commerce to base their retirement

2

policies on individual merit rather than using age as an

3

automatic proxy for ability.

4

And the fact that it exercises both of these

5

powers at the same time for different sets of employees

6

raises nc questions of even the wisdom of what Congress

7

has done.

8

not wrong about treating federal and state firefighters

9

differently, it is very clear that Congress has the

10
11
12
13

Whatever one may think about what is or is

power to do just exactly that.
See in this respect South Central Timber
versus Wunicke.
Nothing more is involved than, in the language

14

of Footnote 17 of EECC versus Wyoming, the ebbs and

15

flows of political decisionmaking, which are matters for

16

Congress itself and these who vote for its members.

17

Now, finally, the great bulk of the

18

respondents* arguments are properly addressed to two

19

audiences, and neither of them is this Court.

20

of those audiences is the Court of Appeals for the

21

Fourth Circuit, which never reached the issues on which

22

the respondent lost before the District Court and which

23

it wants to argue here.

24
25

There are two such issues.

The first

The first is

whether under all the facts and circumstances of this

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

case, age 55 is a bona fide occupational qualification.

2

And the second is, what standard should be applied in

3

making

that determination?
And the second appropriate audience is the

4

5

respondent itself.

If the Mayor and City Council cf

6

Baltimore really believe that age 55 or under is

7

essential for the safety of their firefighters, then the

8

Mayor and City Council of Baltimore should adopt a

9

mandatory retirement of age 55 for all firefighters

10

rather than adopting it for some but excluding others

11

for whom age is just as much a proxy for fitness as it

12

is for these petitioners.

13

issue of whether a real age 55 retirement qualification

14

is a BFCQ.

15

Then we could get on with the

But at the present time, none of those issues

16

is now before this Court, and none is suitable for

17

initial appellate review by this Court.

18

thing for the Court do to therefore is to reverse the

19

judgment of the Court cf Appeals and remand the case to

20

that court for disposition of the remaining issues.

directed at arbitrary discrimination on account of age.

It was the unreasoned, unreasonable assumptions about

19

persons which Congress sought to address in 1967 when it

20

adopted the Age Discrimination and Employment Act.

21

Throughout the legislative history of the Act,

22

it was very clear from the President's message that the

23

Act must have a reasonable, bona fide occupational

24

qualification or reasonable exception to the strictures

25

which were placed upon employees.

in this case as opposed to other cases in which statutes

that we are endorsing, or the approach that we are

At the very least. Your Honor.

14

Our suggestion is, the position that we endorse is that

15

when the reasonable federal standard, when that rational

16

basis in fact is examined either by a District Court or

17

by a Circuit Court, that great weight and care should be

18

given to looking at the reasons why the legislature, the

19

city council, or the state legislature did what it did.

20

After all, the purpose of the Age

21

Discrimination in Employment Act was to eradiate

22

arbitrary and unreasoned distinctions based on age.

23

Certainly if the city council had before it the evidence

24

which I believe we produced in the District Court, our

25

actions were rot arbitrary, were not unreasonable, and

5

fact, that is the reasonable and just way in which to

6

deal with this problem.

In

As an example, it has been nearly five, now,

7

8

going cn six years since this case was litigated to this

9

point.

It took the mayor and city council about three

10

years or half that time from the time it was first told

11

that there was a problem with firefighting and law

12

enforcement to the time when it created an entirely new

13

pension system to address those problems.

14

And in fact what happened then was that the

15

federal government in creating 8335(b), the bills which

16

were to become 8335(b) then relied upon the various

17

experiences which the federal — excuse me, which the

18

state and local governments had regarding mandatory

19

retirement and regarding the most important factor of

20

our retirement plan, which is increasing the annual

21

benefit to counteract for the shorter working life.

22

And that is why there is such a close parallel

23

between 8335(1) and the relevant provision in the

24

Baltimore City Code.

25

creating a mandatory retirement provision.

It wasn't simply a matter of
It was a

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

restructuring of benefits fcr these employees.
It was creating a pension plan predicated cpcn

3

a shorter working life, but with increased benefits sc

4

that an employee in the ERS who worked for approximately

5

half of his life with the mayor and city council would

6

receive the same pro rata retirement benefit as a fire

7

and police employee who also worked for half of that

8

foreshortened working life.

I

9

What we tried to do in that case, in the case

10

of the FSPERS was to make retirement feasible at age 50

11

for these employees, because the evidence which was

12

adduced to us by the firefighters themselves and their

13

union was that these employees were dying at age 59,

14

which is earlier than the earliest elective age in the

15

ERS, and that being age 60.

16

So, in order to preserve the safety and to

17

take into account the concerns of the citizens of

18

Baltimore, a new pension plan was created with a

19

mandatory retirement age of 50 and an optional

20

retirement — a mandatory retirement age of 55, and an

21

optional retirement age of 50, and in crder to

22

grandfather in the existing pension plan members, then

23

the various ages were set up prediated upon length of

24

service and rank.

25

There was evidence that when we created the
29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

FRPERS that because of the imbalance in our age force a

2

retirement at age 55 of everyone across the board world

3

completely cut away our officers and the persons of rank

4

in the police department and fire departments. So

5

therefore it was essential that we created a staggered

6

system of mandatory retirement ages and that we

7

encourage retirement as early as age 50.

8

This is precisely what the federal government

9

did in this regard.

10

QUESTION;

Kay I ask in that connection, I

11

understand the problems of adjusting ycur pension rights

12

of people with different seniority and different ages

13

made it appropriate to have exceptions from a mandatory

14

retirement age of 55, and therefore your staggered

15

system, but do you rely on the difficulties of arranging

16

the pension rights of the various firefighters as a

17

justification for the BFOQ at 55?

MR. GAWLIK:

19

QUESTION;

20
21

No, we don’t rely upon that.
Merely as an explanation for the

exceptions to it?
MR. GAWLIK;

Yes, yes, but we also consider

22

that the difficulty in arranging this pension system is

23

one reason why when there are sound factual bases for an

24

ordinance, we think that these bases in the ordinance

25

should be accorded some deference when it comes to

QUESTION:

2

But if it otherwise violated the

3

federal statute, you wouldn’t say you would get an

4

exemption because it is kind of complicated to comply,

5

would you?
SE. GAWLIK:

6

No, no, that is correct.

The

7

position that we endorse is essentially the one that is

8

warranted by the legislative history itself, that being

9

that there shculd.be a basis in fact fcr the employers’

10

actions, but it need not prove to an absolute necessity

11

that what it does is warranted by the conditions.

12

We feel that what we adduced before the

13

District Court certainly should have carried the day

14

with respect to the rational basis or the reasonable

15

necessity, rather, of our plan.

was that you are calculating a certain number of years

mathematics don't work out.

And in the Wunicke case there was no specific

the comparable Alaska statute did not create a federal

In this particular case there is no such

petitioners is a patchwork, quilt, province by province,

township by tcwnship determination, assuming that the

11

townships can get that far,

12

endure an age discrimination case, and that patchwork

13

quilt is what is going to cause great disruption to the

14

purposes of the Age Discrimination and Employment Act.

15

On the other hand, the approach taken by the

16

Fourth Circuit is reasonable and would lead to harmony

In that regard, I would cite to the Court the

It is essentially legislative.

QUESTIONS

MR. GAWLIK:

And who was the judge?
That was Chief Judge Brown, I

believe.

QUESTION:

He no longer is Chief.

MR. GAWLIKs

In 3ny respect, this is essentially a

7

legislative process.

Whether the District Court admits

8

it or not, whether the Circuit Court admits it or not,

9

this is essentially a process by which a BFCQ either

10

will be legislated or will not be legislated, and

11

recently the courts have not been too reluctant to

12

create BFOQ's, finding that the actions are reasonable,

13

the actions of the political subdivisions, rather, are

14

reason able.

would respectfully request that the decision of the

The first is that while interesting, much cf

2

hr. Gawlik’s argument simply went to the proposition

3

that the age criterion is rational, and that, while

4

interesting,

5

is totally irrelevant under the ADEA.

The second point is simply that there are

6

interesting questions in this case, and Kr. Gawlik has

7

discussed them.

8

should constitute any evidence at all, and the other is

9

whether under all the facts and circumstances of this

10
11

One is whether tha federal statute

case there is or is not a BFOQ.
But it is very clear and respondents do not

12

dispute that that issue is not before this Court.

If

13

there was ever any question about it before, there

14

certainly cannot be any question after Kr. Gawlik’s

15

argument that this case must be reversed and remanded

16

for consideration by the Fourth Circuit of the issues

17

that Hr. Gawlik wishes to present to them.
