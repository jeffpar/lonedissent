This case is here on a writ

In order to answer the question of whether or

6

different things.

1924 Act has

The first is the administrative understandirg

8

and practice ever the years as it applied to the

9

taxation authority, including after the enactment of the

10

'38 Act; and with that contemporaneous commentary and

11

understanding by commentators in this area, the second

12

thing that needs to be looked at Is the language of the

13

statutes themselves; and then the lecrislative history cf

14

the enactments needs to be looked at; and finally,

15

standard cancrs cf statutory construction need to be

16

applied to the view of these statutes.

17

I mentioned the administrative understanding

18

and contemporaneous commentary first because that seems

19

to be the most compelling thing to look at here.

20

were years and years cf administrative understanding and

21

policy and participation by the United States that beth

22

recognized and facilitated the collection of the state

taxes in issue here.

The contemporaneous practice in this case

3

appears to be especially significant since in the 1924

In addition to this administrative practice I

13
14

think it's significant that the contemporaneous

15

commentary supported the or recognized

16

the state to tax, including after

the authority cf

One case that we didn't cite to this Court,

2

although we cited in the Ninth Circuit, was Watt v.

Alaska, a 198 1 case in this Court, where in footnote

this Court opined that it would he almost conceivable

that Congress would change in that case a specific

longstanding formula for distributing funds without

comment.

8

this case that Congress would change without comment a

specific longstanding tax authorization which up until

I think that it's equally inconceivable in

1977 had not leen questioned.

11

The Ninth Circuit avoided using the statutory

12

construction canons for repeals which would insist that

13

the intent to repeal a specific provision must be clear

14

by saying that the earlier statute was replaced.

think that when you have a specific prevision in an

earlier statute and then you have a later, general

MS. WHITEING;

the points that Montana has addressed.

what is and

of taxes in

1938 Act leases.

confusion, and I think Montana's argument today adds tc

that confusion.

What is in the record shows seme taxes were

paid on some

1977.

6

paid on

1938 Act leases between the years 1955 and

The record is silent on whether any taxes were
1938

Act leases before that time.

The tribe has been involved in this case for

7

8

many years, and we have diligently looked for any

9

evidence to show that taxes have been paid on 1938 Act

10

leases before that time.

In fact, it has been as much

11

in the tribe's interest to find that evidence for refund

12

purposes as it is in the state’s interest.
What we have found is in the record, and what

13
14

that is is an audit report which is an audit of the

15

records of the U.F.

16

some taxes were paid on 1938 Act leases between the

17

years mentioned, 1955 and 1S77.

to the tribe for payment of taxes.

It did

not lock to Interior, and Interior was neither paying

3

nor facilitating payment of

those taxes.

4

Because the state looked to the tribe for

5

payment and because, as that opinion indicates, the

tribe in fact was not paying those taxes, the producers

were being billed for the taxes, and that was the reason

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NS. DEIRDRE BOGGS, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF CF THE PETITIONERS -- REBUTTAL

7

NS. BOGGS;

I think that the main difference

8

in the position of the tribe and the state is hew you

9

focus on the 1938 Act.

The tribe insists that this

10

Court focus on that act as a separate, independent

11

new-blcwn act of Congress that bears no relation tc

12

anything previously, and that therefore, the silence on

13

the issue of taxation has a different significance than

14

we would give it.

15

In fact, the '38 Act was a remedial act to

16

deal with specific itemized defects in the leasing laws

17

as they affected Indian tribes and Indian lands.

18

not an act to deal with problems of taxation.

the two contemporaneous commentaries that I mentioned

I think that when his opinion about taxation

had been proven wrong six years ago when a new taxation

was valid on the Blackfeet Reservation and on similar

reservations, and he's searching his mind for why there

22

is a problem here, and he doesn't come up with taxation
