CEAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY J. OECHLEE, JR., ESQ.,

7

ON BEHAIF CF TRANS WORLD AIRLINES, INC.
ME. OECHLER:

8

9

please

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

the Court, this Court granted certiorari to the

10

second circuit to consider three issues under the Age

11

Discrimination and Employment Act:

12

liability under the ADEA; two, a standard for

13

wilfullness under the ADEA; and three, whether a union

14

car be monetarily liable under the ADEA.

15

one, a standard cf

Now, TWA, like all major airlines, must adhere

16

to the safety regulations of the Federal Aviation

17

Administration.

18

requires that a captain cannot serve as a captain beyond

19

the age cf 60, and the issue before this Court is, to

20

what extent, if any, the ADEA requires an employer to

21

find another job for that captain nor anyone else unable

22

to perform in his former position because cf age.

23

One cf these safety regulations

Now, in an effort to make just such an

24

acccmmcdaticn, TWA took the lead amongst the airline

25

industry and adopted a policy cf relying on the existing

4

1

neutral bidding procedures of its working agreement»
Cver a four-year period, this policy resulted

2
3

in an 83 percent success rate for those captains seeking

4

to serve as flight engineers -- for these captains

5

seeking to serve beyond age 60 in a position not subject

6

to the FAA rule, namely, that cf flight engineer, which

7

is the third seat in the cockpit.
And while TWA was experiencing an 83 percent

8
9

success rate, the rest cf the airline industry during

10

this four-year period had a zero percent success rate.

11

Nevertheless, despite this 83 percent success rate, that

12

was not sufficient fer what the EEOC itself admits is a

13

handful of plaintiffs who were retired as captains

14

because they had been unable or unwilling to obtain a

15

flight

engineer bid.
New, the court below said that the plaintiffs

16
17

were entitled to a virtual guarantee tc a flight

18

engineer position, because in certain limited and

19

admittedly non-age-related circumstances, there is an

20

automatic right for a captain to go to flight

21

engine e r.

22

For example, under the contract, a captain

23

must maintain an FAA first class medical certificate.

24

If for medical reasons he cannot maintain

25

medical certificate, and can only maintain a second

5

that FAA

1

class medical certificate, he is entitled under the

2

contract to revert to flight engineer.
New, the ccurt said,

3

because you did that for

4

what was admittedly a non-age reason, you must dc a

5

similar type of accommodation with respect to the

6

plaintiffs here.

That was impossible because of the FAA rule,

have reverted to flight engineer at age 55.
But we submit that the ADEA and the

2
3

legislative history of the AEEA says you do not no* have

4

to create that right based cn age.

5

of Fepresentatives report which accompanied the 1978

6

amendments which are at issue here specifically said,

7

you do net have to provide special working conditions,

8

and specifically said, based or age, and specifically

9

said,

10

Page 12 of the House

you do not have to retrain and transfer.
And what we are talking abcut here is

11

retraining Captain Thurston and transferring him from a

12

captain to flight engineer.

13

much an employer must accomodate its employees was a

14

subject of concern to this Court in another case

15

involving TWA, in another case involving the TWA

16

collective bargaining agreement.

17

New, the question of hew

That case was TWA v. Eardisan, at U32 US 63,

18

and in that case. Nr. Fardisan contended that because of

19

his religious beliefs, he was entitled not to work cn a

20

Saturday, despite the fact that the seniority previsions

21

and the working agreement were going to require him to

22

work on a Saturday.

23

That case arose under Title 7, where there

24

actually is a specific provision abcut acccmmedaticr ,

25

while -- a religious accommedation, while here it can

7

1

only be — such a claim for accommodation can only be

2

implied, and the Court said that you do not have tc go

3

that far -- Pages 79 to 81 in particular, they discussed

4

this question -- that the employer does not have tc go

5

that far to accommodate the employee.
And we submit that has equal applicability

6
7

here,

and it is also important tc remember hew the

8

posture of this case arose.

9

policy

in August of

When TWA announced its

1978, it was immediately faced with

10

a lawsuit from the union contending that what we had

11

done by allowing anyone to fly beyond 6C, and today we

12

have over 150 people flying beyond 60, violated the

13

Railway labor Act, because we had unilaterally changed

14

our wages, rates, and working conditions.
And they also contended that what we had dene

15
16

was not mandated by the ADEA.

Soon thereafter the

17

plaintiffs came in and said that we hadn't gone far

18

enough.

19

plaintiffs came in several months later, brought suit

20

saying we hadn't, gone far enough to accommodate them.

The union said we had gone too far.

The

21

Then we were faced with a third suit brought

22

by younger flight engineers whe quite properly pointed

23

out that they had teen put cn furlough because in a

24

reduction in force we had keft the older people cr the

25

payroll based on their seniority, and we had -- when we

8

1

had a reduction in force, the younger people had gotten

2

furloughed, and they contended we had again violated the

3

Railway Labor Act.
So, TWA was faced with the situation where it

4
5

is trying to comply with both the contract and various

6

statutes.

7

decision that courts are less competent to restructure

8

business practices and the law does not require

9

employers to maximize employee opportunities, and we

QUESTIONi

I suppose if the basis for the

13

ruling was you were discriminating, I suppose you could

14

have eliminated the discrimination the ether way by

15

not allowing any automatic transfers.

16

MR. OECHLERi

Well, cur contract allowed

17

downbidding, and prior to age CO, historically the

18

contract did allow downbidding, so we felt --

That’s right.

Yes, that was provided in the

contract.
QUESTION:

6

I suppose you could have negotiated

7

yourself out of that.

If these automatic downtiddings

8

were eliminated, you wouldn't -- this case wouldn't be

9

here,

would it?
KB. OECHIEB:

10

Arguably net, but those

11

provisions have been in the contract a

long time,

and we

12

certainly would have been faced with a claim by the

13

plaintiffs if we did eliminate these types cf automatic

14

downbidding that that was an effort at age

15

discrimination because we were eliminating

16

their claims, and that that would be further evidence of

17

age discrimination.

fact that they are 60 years cf age that disqualifies

them from the dewnbidding right?

MR. OEC9LER:

No, it is the age 60, a rule

imposed by the government, and now the government is

saying, we must make -- they are telling us what we must

the Court, the argument

addressed by TWA revolves

around

Section 4(a)

20

argues that there is no substantive violation of that

Section 4(f)(1) in plain terms says that it is not

Now, that is the kind of sweeping language

19

that this Court has admonished time and again is to le

read in accordance with its terms, and indeed,

21

EEOC is actually asking that this Court do is to revise

22

the section so that where the section says that the

23

employer may take any action, it should be read to say,

24

the employer may take only one action.

25

The Senate passed an amendment to 4(f)(1),

It wasn't a Committee.

It was

explicitly that the action that could le taken under

23

2

perceive no distinction between this statutory scheme in

3

that sense and, of course, Title 7 and the Equal Pay

4

Act, which was part of the PISA that was dealt with in

5

the THU case.

6

Eut if the Court were to reach the guesticr,

7

the argument that Section 7(b) or 7(c) of

the ADEA adds

8

remedies to these contained in the FLSA and creates a

9

remedy against a unicn is really another invitation to

10

judicial legislation, because whereas it is true that

Title 7 substantive prohibitions are very similar to, as

12

this Court recognized in Lorillard, to the ADEA

13

substantive prevision.

14

The remedial schemes, the comprehensive

remedial scheme of ADEA and

the FLSA is quite different,

and while Congress in Title 7 established a monetary

remedy against, unions, it did not do sc in the ADEA.

18

When we are dealing with a comprehensive remedial scheme

19

our position is simply to follow the precedents that

were laid out in Northwest v. TWU and the Ratcliffe

HR. WALLACE;

6

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, there are three separate categories of

8

issues to be determined in this case.

whether there was a viclaticn in this case which would

10

The first is

automatically give rise to a remedy for back pay.
The second is whether the liquidated damages

and that is the only question with respect tc

14

which

the statutory limitation to vilfull viclaticrs

15

comes into the case.

16

the union shares liability for monetary relief with the

17

employer, and whether that question is properly before

18

the Court.

19

And the third question is whether

Addressing the question of a violation first,

20

we readily agree that nothing in the Act would require

21

TWA to make any arrangements to transfer captains cr

22

copilots tc other jobs at the time that they are

23

reguired to leave those positions if such transfer

24

arrangements aren't made for other employees.

25

This is strictly a disparate treatment case in

comparing the way these older employees are treated with

2

the way younger employees are treated.

3

have been told by TWA is that these pilots upon reaching

4

age 60 are nc longer pilots in command, and therefore

5

cannot qualify for any transfer rights.

Sow, what we

6

There are two points tc be made.

The first

7

is, all of the plaintiffs before the Court requested

8

transfers prior to reaching their 6Cth birthday, when

9

they were pilots in command.

Those who were

10

unsuccessful in obtaining the transfers were

11

uns vcce ssf ul because the process could not he completed

12

prior to reaching their 60th birthday.

13

We discuss in footnote 9 in cur brief one

14

exceptional case where through correspondence with the

15

employer one of the EECC plaintiffs was, he says, misled

16

into net actually submitting his bid until after his

17

60th birthday.

18

But the basic point -- it is the second point

19

-- is that in comparing their situation with these of

20

younger pilots exercising transfer reguests, the younger

21

pilots who flunk their medical examination fer a first

22

class medical certificate and then request a transfer,

23

or who are disciplined for misconduct in their job as

24

captains or as copilots are no longer pilots in command

25

when they make their request fer a transfer.

26

Sc, there is no distinction between the

plaintiffs here and the younger pilots whose treatment

ME. WALLACE;

I don’t know the answer tc that

15

question, Justice O’Conner.

It is the kind of argument

16

that is similar to arguments that were made against the

17

Age Discrimination and Employment Act altogether, that

18

it was going to deprive younger workers of opportunities

19

tc move up and tc transfer to ether positions, and

20

Congress resolved that policy question the other vaj,

21

and when Congress thought the Courts and particularly

22

this Court had gone toe far in permitting mandatory

23

retirements as part of a seniority system, they amended

24

the Act to say that mandatory retirements could not le a

25

part of this defense based on a seniority system.

29

They were concerned that people who still

also relates to the ether one as well, perhaps

21

the most misleading thing about this case and the danger

22

of this case in interpreting the pertinent statutory

terms is that the facts here are so very far from the

24

typical case that Congress bad in mind when they enacted

25

the liquidated damages provision initially in the Fair

34

1

Later Standards Act, or when they carried it over into

2

the Age Eiscriminaticn and Employment Act.
They were not thinking of relatively well to

do employees such as these pilots who already qualify

5

for comfortable pensions.

6

initially in the Fair lator Standards Act were people

who weren't even getting the minimum wage, and perhaps

Now, in enacting the ADEA and carrying this

20
21

prevision over, again Congress was thinking of workers

22

who would be hard pressed in their personal situations

23

by violations.
When Secretary Willard Wertz, the Secretary of

24
25

Labor,

testified in support of the bill in the hearings.

35

1

the particular example that he gave in some detail was

2

of a 51-year-old factory worker who had been forced to

3

drop out of high school many years earlier and worked at

4

odd jobs, and finally worked himself up into a position

5

in a factory, and then the factory closed, and he found

himself in a position of having to apply for other jobs,

that his education was less than high school

And then he cited -QUESTION;

10

Of course, those examples are

11

always the kind that proponents of the till give, but

12

then Congress enacts a general provision, and it covers

13

a let more people than just the examples.
NR. WALLACE:

14

That’s right, but my point is

15

that this Court's interpretation of the statutory terms

16

are going to cover a lot more people than just the

17

plain tiffs in this case, and that it is important, to

18

keep in mind the examples that were foremost in the

19

Congressional mind in enacting these provisions.
And if I may just finish this point, what the

20

21

Secretary cited to Congress was that over a third of all

22

men who have been unemployed 21 weeks or more, this

23

overall hard core unemployed, are over 45, although this

24

group makes up slightly less than a quarter of the work

6

And it was in light of testimony of this sort

7

and discussions of this sort that the ccnference report

8

referred to the liquidated damages provision as

9

compensatory in nature rather than a penalty on the

10

employer, and quoted from this Court's decision in

11

Overnight Transportation Company against Kissel, which

12

descrihed this as the prpese cf the Fair Lator

13

Standards Act's liquidated damages provision.

14

And it is against this background that we ask

15

the Court to consider the standard we have urged.

16

don't think that Congress in enacting these provisions

17

had in mind that an employer who chose to make a legal

18

argument when he knew the Act applied but thought he

the Court, this is net a case about what type cf

accommodation should be given to workers of any age.

10

is a case about whether pilots approaching age 60 who

11

wish to transfer to the flight engineer position are

12

treated less favorably because of their age.
The appropriate universe of pilots here to

13
14

consider is all of those pilots who lose their

15

qualifications for whatever reason and need or want to

16

transfer to the flight engineer position.
This, both in the District Court and in the

17
18

Court of Appeals, was a summary judgment case.

19

no dispute that all, every single one cf the younger

20

pilots who had sufficient seniority to transfer were

21

allowed to transfer to the flight engineer position.

I would like to bring the case tack for a minute
In

1978, when TWA refused

it didn't have any captains employed in the flight

TWA talks about the 60 people who later
transferred from captain to flight engineer.
QUESTION:

Just what difference would that

41

1

make in the whole
MR. FAYi

2

Because when Captain Thurston asked

3

to transfer to flight engineer, the response he get frerr

4

the company was not that he didn't have a hid on file,

5

but that he was about to reach the mandatory retirement

6

age that had been agreed to by the union and the

7

com pan y.
Sc, there was a -- that stark difference in

8
9

treatment because of age is plainly -- is plain to see.

10

It was net because he didn't have a bid, or hadn't

11

submitted the appropriate papers for transfer.

12

solely

It was

because of his age.
Now, that practice did change a little bit

13
14

later,

but TWA makes it sound like nothing began until

15

it announced that it was going to employ people past

16

60.

17

EECC claimants in this case turned 6C and were required

18

to retire long before TWA actually employed any captains

19

in that flight engineer position beyond age 60.

The majority of the remaining plaintiffs and the

New, for those later EFOC claimants, it was

22

was still the same.

23

the pilots who were younger and 60 and wished to

do so.

It was based on age, because all

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY J. OECHLER, JR.,

11
12

ON

13

MR. OECHLER;

ESQ.,

EEHALF OF TWA - REBUTTAI
If

I may just briefly address

14

the wilfullness question, the statute in Section 7(b)

15

says the liquidated damages or double damages should

16

only be provided, only -- that's the word

in the statute

17

-- only provided in the case of a wilfull

violation.

Now, the EEOC says that the standard for

18
19

liquidated damages is if the employer knew that its

20

conduct was governed by the ADEA. That is all the

21

employer has to knew,

22

quote,

23

knew that its conduct was going to be covered by the

24

ADEA.

25

and It concedes that, quote,

end

only in the rarest of cases will an employer not

He is going to have to be living in a tunnel

^5

1

not to know that his conduct was governed by the ATEA,

2

and in fact under the ADEA he is required to post a

3

statute, so he certainly is going to have to know that

4

his conduct is governed by it.

5

New, either the word "only" means something,

6

and it means that there is a twe-tiered level of

7

liability, and in cur brief we discuss the fact that

8

that is what we believe the legislative histcry

9

supports, or it doesn't, and we suggest that Senator

10

Javits, when he inserted the provision about liquidated

11

damages, it was a substitute fer a criminal previsier,

12

and two circuits have held that that was meant tc be

13

punitive in nature.

14

Rnd yet what the EEOC says is, all you have tc

15

do is know that your conduct was governed by the ADEA,

16

therefore we held you liable fer double damages.

17

we submit that what is required is a specific intent to

18

violate the ADEA, and that is what was meant, that was

19

what was meant by the insertion of that prevision,

20

because that was what — that was what Senator Javits

21

meant by the fact that it should be punitive.

22

Now,

Nov,

I do want to go back for a moment to this

23

whole question of liability.

The previsions that the

24

plaintiffs talk about were just as available tc everyone

25

on the TNA pilot work force.

They were available tc

46

Captain Thurston and they were available tc everycre

6

7

Justice Van Grafelin said.

Now, the subject that

8

counsel raised about disciplinary downgrades is

9

addressed in Note 15 of our brief.

The only instance

10

that this disciplinary downgrade arose during the course

11

of this entire litigation involved somebody who had a
