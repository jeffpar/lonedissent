CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

next in Metropolitan Life Insurance Company against

Mr. Greenfield, you may begin whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY GREENFIELD, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GREENFIELD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on appeal from the Supreme

12

Judicial Court of Massachusetts.

13

of a state law which we have been calling Section 47B.

14

The question is whether that state law is preempted by either

15

of two federal statutes, ERISA or the NLRA.

16

the ERISA issue and my colleague, Mr. McGovern, will address

17

the NLRA issue.

18

It concerns the validity

I will address

We have between ourselves allocated 20 minutes

19

to the ERISA argument and I hope to save some of that time

20

for rebuttal.

21

We are concerned with Section 47B to the extent

22

that it relates to welfare plans governed by ERISA.

23

its express terms, that statute directly regulates and

24

relates to employee welfare plans.

25

and I quote, "That any employee's health and welfare fund

The statute provides,

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

By

(202) 628-9300

1

which provides hospital expense and surgical expense benefits

2

and which covers Massachusetts residents shall provide

3

certain specified benefits for mental or nervous conditions."

4

Now, the statute also regulates and relates to

5

ERISA plans in another respect.

6

of insurance issued to an ERISA plan shall furnish the same

7

detailed benefits.

8
9

It provides that any policy

So, there are two relevant parts to the statute,
the part that requires the plan to provide the specified

10

benefits, that is direct regulation, and the part that

11

requires policies purchased by those plans to provide the

12

same benefits.

13

those benefits.

14

but accurately indirect regulation.

15

If the plan is insured, the plan must provide
That is — for lack of a better term —

There is no question concerning the purpose of

16

this statute.

17

of a legislative committee that the purpose is to change

18

the manner in which mental health care is funded and provided

19

in Massachusetts.

20

the Commonwealth positively asserts it.

21

It is clear from the very extensive report

The Commonwealth not only concedes this,

There brief says for one example that the purpose

22

of the statute is, and I quote, "The Massachusetts State

23

Legislature adopted Section 47B to address the problems

24

of treating mental illness."

25

Another place in the brief:

"Section 47B

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 f ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

implements a broad policy with respect to treatment of mental

2

illness."
So, the purpose of this statute is not to prevent

3
4

unfair trade practices by the insurer and it is not to

5

guarantee that the insurance company is going to be solvent

6

when a claim is filed.

7

regulate insurance.

8

as a means, a vehicle, for shifting costs and expanding

9

services.

The purpose, I submit, is not to

Insurance comes into the picture only

10

There is no question that this statute is pre­

11

empted by ERISA to the extent it seeks to regulate plans

12

directly.

13

a lessee insurer and those foreclose any fair dispute on

14

the subject.

That was conceded by the Commonwealth before

Nor can there be any serious question concerning

15

16

the impact of 47B as it is construed by the state and by

17

the majority of the court below.

18
19

If an ERISA plan does obtain insurance, if it
is self-insured, 47B is preempted.

20

QUESTION:

Benefits cannot --

The Supreme Judicial Court held invalid

21

the part that attempted to directly regulate the plan,

22

didn't it?

23

MR. GREENFIELD:

The Commonwealth conceded its

24

invalidity before that time and the Supreme Judicial Court

25

noted that, Justice Rehnquist.

QUESTION:

MR. GREENFIELD:

3

is invalid."

Well, didn't it also hold it was invalid?
Not in the words "we hold it

It was just assumed --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. GREENFIELD:

Assumed by everybody.
That is not a serious question

6

and I don't think the Commonwealth would contend otherwise

7

now.
The question here is that if a plan buys insurance

8

9

the position is that the benefits can be mandated.

I mean,

10

the Commonwealth says and the Supreme Judicial Court held

11

that if a plan chooses to buy insurance the state can man­

12

date the entire benefits package, each and every item in

13

it.

14

Now, the Supreme Judicial Court and the Commonwealth,

15

they don't suggest that this distinction between insured

16

and uninsured plans makes any sense and it really doesn't.

17

No one has ever attempted to say that is sensible.

18

do they suggest that the distinction promotes a statutory

19

purpose.

20

Neither

It seriously undermines that purpose.
Section 3 of ERISA makes it clear that there is

21

to be no distinction drawn between insured and uninsured

22

plans.

23

welfare plans, as those which provide health benefits, and

24

I quote, "Through the purchase of insurance or otherwise."

25

It provides — it defines welfare plans, employee

Section 2 of the statute says that it is the policy

of the Act to present the interest of participants in

2

employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries.

3

Yet, what we have here is that by making insurance

4

disadvantageous plans are induced to give up the protection

5

that an insurance policy provides.

6

Now, the majority opinion below presents a multi­

7

state plan, the multi-state insured plan with several choices

8

and I submit they are Hobson's choices, one choice.

9

12

benefit.

13

that, in Massachusetts you give that, but the bottom line

14

is there is no uniform plan and there is much greater

15

administrative expense.

16

particular states will either have to pay the higher premiums

17

or sacrifice wanted benefits for less desired mandated

18

benefits.

19

If Oregon has one statute, you give the Oregon

Employers and employees in

Another choice that an insured plan faces is this:

20

Assuming that the state laws are not in conflict, the plans

21

could comply with the laws of all states in a uniform plan.

22

You simply provide the most generous benefit given any place.

23

Now to state a self-evident proposition that may

24

have been lost sight of by the court below, just as there

is no such thing as a free lunch, there is no such thing

10

QUESTION:

But that is true of any resident of

11

Massachusetts operating under this statute, isn't it, that

12

they may have to give up some benefits that they want in

13

order to get the unwanted perhaps mental health benefit.

14

MR. GREENFIELD:

That is not only true, that is

15

one of the reasons why the opinion below is incorrect, Justice

16

Rehnquist.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

I don't see why it follows that it

is incorrect.
MR. GREENFIELD:

Because Congress made it quite

20

clear that it wanted the benefit package to be a matter

21

of private choice.

22

different health priorities, different needs, different

23

desires than an airplane pilot would have.

24

very clearly left that part to private regulation.

QUESTION:

To take an example, a coal miner has

2

MR. GREENFIELD:

I submit that that does not answer

3

the question, that raises the question.

4

law that regulates insurance within the meaning of ERISA?

5

And, to answer that question you have got to look both at

6

the preemption clause and at the savings clause.

7

made it very clear that the preemption clause was to be

8

construed as broadly as possible.

11

regulated.

12

When it came out of committee, just before it

13

was enacted, the present preemption clause which this Court

14

accurately described as unique in its scope came out saying

15

that everything was preempted.

16

and congressmen involved in this, Senator Javits and

17

Congressman Dent, they made it very clear that they were

18

doing this in order to keep the states out of this regulatory

field entirely.

MR. GREENFIELD:

2

QUESTION:

Williams and Dent.

-- and Dent there was no direct

3

reference to benefits under the policies of insurance, was

4

there?
MR. GREENFIELD:

5

There was not.

There was some

6

legislative history making it quite clear that in pension

7

plans there was supposed to be private choice and there

8

is no rational way to read the statute to distinguish in

9

between pension plans and employee benefit plans.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Greenfield, does the McCarran-

11

Ferguson Acts provision have any aspects that merit our

12

attention as well wherein it says that no subsequent act

13

of Congress is going to be construed to invalidate a state

14

law regulating the business of insurance?

15

MR. GREENFIELD:

Well, I think it has been held,

16

and I don't think seriously disputed by the Commonwealth --

17

It was held in the Hewlett-Packard case in the Ninth Circuit -

18

that ERISA is a statute which relates to the business of

19

insurance, so that aspect of the McCarran Act doesn't apply

20

to.

21

Now, there have been --

22

QUESTION:

Well, it occurs to me that the language

23

is so similar to the exemption that is enacted here in the

24

ERISA Act that it might have something.

25

MR. GREENFIELD:

Well, let me go to McCarran for

a second, Justice O'Connor.

2

with state statutes for the purpose -- that is the word

3

the statute uses — for the purpose of regulating the business

4

of insurance and the purpose — Unless you simply say that

5

a statute has that purpose whenever it has the word

6

i-n-s-u-r-a-n-c-e in it you cannot, I think, fairly say

7

that this Massachusetts statute is for the purpose of

8

regulating the business of insurance.

9

reallocate costs from the state through the insurance

The McCarran-Ferguson Act deals

The purpose is to

10

companies to employers and employees and to increase the

11

use of out-patient facilities as opposed to hospitalization.

12

It is spelled out very clearly.

13

places in the Commonwealth's brief.

14
15
16

It is in at least four

But, McCarran-Ferguson shouldn't apply here for
another reason.
QUESTION:

Well, but the terminology in McCarran-

17

Ferguson, I guess, is the regulation of the business of

18

insurance, isn't it?

19

20
21

22
23

MR. GREENFIELD:

The purpose of regulating the

business of insurance, yes.
QUESTION:

And that has been interpreted to cover

insurance policy benefits, hasn't it?
MR. GREENFIELD:

I don't think — Well, this

24

Court has considered that clause on many occasions, of course.

25

I am aware of no case which applies that clause to a statute
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

as to whether a state can mandate benefits.

2

But, I would go one step further.

I would say

3

that McCarran-Ferguson -- I would go two steps.

4

say first of all that McCarran-Ferguson is of no help in

5

deciding this case and I would say, second, that if you

6

look to McCarran-Ferguson it really supports our position

7

more than the Commonwealth's position.

8
9

I would

The Court is very familiar with McCarran-Ferguson.
It arose as a reaction to Southeastern Underwriters when Paul

10

versus Virginia was overruled in about 1944 or 1945 and

11

there was a great fear that this would knock out all the

12

state regulation of insurance no matter where it was.

13

This Court had held in the National Securities

14

case and Royal Drug, Pireno, time and time again that what

15

you were trying to do is give states the power that they

16

had before Southeastern Underwriters.

17

Now, before Southeastern Underwriters and really

18

up until this time, up until this case almost, when people

19

spoke about the regulation of insurance what they were talking

20

about is to protect the insured from the insurer, to protect

21

overreaching by the insurance company.

22

QUESTION:

How about a law that says insurance

23

companies have to insure people who are otherwise uninsurable,

24

kind of a risk pool, would you say that is a regulation

25

of insurance?

Would you say it is a regulation of

9

than what we have here.

I would say that might

That is much different though

What we have here is a state is

10

telling the insured you have to buy something you don't

11

want.

12

have to maintain certain reserves, you can't engage in fraud,

13

you have to pass certain licensing requirement.

14

the insured you must purchase a benefit you don't want,

15

instead of getting the eyeglass, you have to get the mental

16

health treatment.

17

that is a regulation of insurance within the meaning of

18

the savings clause if -- and this is a very important if —

19

if you are going to read the savings clause and the pre­

20

emption clause together so as to give vitality to both.

It is not simply telling the insurance company you

It is telling

I don't think that is the type of law

We are not saying that all of those laws, these

hypothetical laws have to go out.

We are saying just the

contrary.

The regulation of insurance as it meant at the

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

this type of statute.

2

QUESTION:

But these kinds of statutes are requiring

3

an insurance policy to cover certain risks if they covered

4

others are not brand new as I understand it.

5

MR. GREENFIELD:

Well, the statute that says that

6

the insured must purchase a policy with that risk, that

7

didn't exist when the savings clause first came in in 1970.

8

This is much different, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, than the

9

statute which says you must offer it.

10

That is not what

we have here.

11

QUESTION:

I can see that each law has a different

12

effect but why is one less the regulation of insurance than

13

the other?

14

MR. GREENFIELD:

Because regulation of insurance

15

traditionally has meant protecting the insured and insuring

16

the -- and guaranteeing the insurance company's solvency.

17

This does --

18

QUESTION:

I would think regulating the business

19

of insurance would mean doing whatever the legislature

20

thought wise to govern how that business is carried out.

21

MR. GREENFIELD:

But, this is regulating — If

22

you take the literal definition the way the state is taking

23

it and you say that whenever there is the word "insurance"

24

it is saved and it is not preempted there is nothing left

25

to the preemption statute, the preemption clause.
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

You can

1

2

no longer have uniformity.
QUESTION:

I submit it is simply --

Well, there is certainly a lot left

3

of a preemption clause.

4

horribles you suggest would follow, a plan doesn't necessarily

5

have to get insurance.

6

MR. GREENFIELD:

Even assuming all the parade of

That is right.

But, ERISA seems

7

to make it quite clear that a plan should have an option

8

and what is the sense of that.

9

of having a rule that says that if you give up the security

I submit what is the sense

10

of insurance you then can have the benefits package that

11

you want, but if you are going to take insurance you then

12

have to take the mandated benefit.

13

that it really increases the likelihood that when the claim

14

is made there won't be funds there.

15

a whimsical distinction to say that if you are uninsured

16

you are not regulated, but if you are insured you have to

17

give the benefits we mandate.

18

served by that.

19

The result of that is

I submit it is almost

There is no useful policy

It is just contrary to the purpose of ERISA.

QUESTION:

Part of that stands for the way Congress

20

phrased the exemption from the preemption clause.

21

Congress put in the exception for regulation of the business

22

of insurance?

23

MR. GREENFIELD:

Why did

Well, when Congress first put —

24

I think there is quite a good reason for that because they

25

didn't want -- the preemption clause is quite broad and
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

it became broader during the summer of 1974.

Congress didn't

2

want a lot of arguments being made that traditional

3

insurance regulation, advertising, fraud, reserves, that

4

they could be escaped by saying I am dealing with an ERISA

5

plan.

6

can't attack me for false advertising, Commonwealth of

7

Massachusetts, because my advertising is directed to an

8

ERISA plan and it is preempted.

9

Congress was trying to say.

An insurance company shouldn't be able to say you

10

When Congress first --

11

QUESTION:

That was the type of thing

Those regulations certainly as well

12

create pockets of differing moods in different states, do

13

they not?

14

MR. GREENFIELD:

15

QUESTION:

16

What type of regulation?

The type of regulation you are talking

about, your so-called traditional regulations.
MR. GREENFIELD:

17

Yes, but they are not regulation

18

of plans.

19

you can only invest in certain types of debt securities

20

than it is to tell a plan you have to purchase coverage

21

for cleft palate or mental health if you are going to be

22

insured, but if you are not insured you don't have to purchase

23

it.

24
25

It is a big difference to tell an insurance company

Yes, there are different regulations.

One state

can require that you have so much in debt and another state
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

can require you to hold less in debt.

2

regulation of a plan.

But that is not a

What we have here is a regulation of a plan.

3
4

It is indirect, but, as I said, an indirect regulation is

5

no different than a direct.
With the Court's permission I will reserve whatever

6
7

time -QUESTION:

8
9

Does this apply to out-of-state coverage?
MR. GREENFIELD:

10
11

One factual question about the statute.

It applies to any Massachusetts

resident no matter where the statute is issued.
QUESTION:

12

You could write a policy on a multi­

13

state plan that did not have the mental coverage in it for

14

the people who are not in Massachusetts, is that right?
MR. GREENFIELD:

15
16

That plan couldn't violate

Massachusetts statute unless there were employees —
QUESTION:

17

Even though the issuing insurance

18

company -- I don't know where your headquarters are.

19

I see.

20

Okay,

Thank you.
MR. GREENFIELD:

The statute is designed to apply

21

no matter where the policy is issued so long as it is a

22

Massachusetts resident.

23

result and you really get it of two people sitting next

24

MR. McGOVERN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
As Mr. Greenfield mentioned, I will address the

23

Appellants' second issue on this appeal, National Labor

24

Relations Act preemption of Section 47B.

25

The

Here the focus is, of course, not on the express

language of a statutory exemption provision, but on an implied

2

preempted intent derived from the purposes or objectives

3

of the National Labor Relations Act and the federal labor

4

policy served by that Act.

5

Appellents in essence say this:

Section 47B under­

6

cuts the federal labor policy that this Court has termed

7

the fundamental premise of the NLRA, private bargaining

8

by the parties to a collective bargaining agreement without

9

official compulsion over the substantive terms of the agreement,

10

whether that compulsion be by the states or by the National

11

Labor Relations Board.

12

Now, to this end Appellants make three principal

13

points.

14

establish that when a state law does exercise compulsion

15

over substantive terms, when the law by its legal effect

16

limits or restricts the parties' solution of a problem which

17

Congress has required them to negotiate in good faith towards

18

solving, the state law is properly preempted.

19

First, this Court's decisions in Oliver and Alessi

For this protective rule to apply, however, the

20

subject involved must be a mandatory subject of collective

21

bargaining and there must be no other federal legislation

22

evidencing a congressional intent to authorize or allow

23

as an exception the particular form of state interference

24

under study.

25

Second, Section 47B, as we shall see, does exercise

compulsion over the substantive terms of insured, collectively

2

3

the parties' solution with respect to a mandatory subject

4

of collective bargaining health benefits, more specifically

5

mental health benefits.

It does limit by its legal effect

Third, there isn't an exception to the general

6
7

rule that applies here.

There is no federal statute

8

authorizing this form of state intrusion, nor is there a

9

broad exception for public health laws as the court below

10

has proposed for the purpose of preemption here is not the

11

preservation of the primary jurisdiction of the NLRB, the

12

purpose here is the protection from state regulation of

13

a subject matter that Congress has intended to leave

14

unregulated.
As this Court has emphasized in two very recent

15

16

decisions, Brown against the Hotel Workers and Belknap against

17

Hale, preemption grounded on this purpose is not rebuttal,

18

not presumptive, not rebuttal, and doesn't encompass

19

exceptions of the types that are associated with the Garman

20

line preemption theory.

to be unregulated, then regulation by a state does constitute

22

an obstacle to the purposes of Congress and preemption is

23

warranted.

25

If Congress intended the matter

Now, what does 47B do, what is its effect in the
collective bargaining context?

no-win choice.

they are compelled to arrive at a result which differs from

5

the one they would have arrived at in the absence of the

6

state statute and mandatory subjects of collective bargaining

7

are directly involved.

8

Either way, whatever alternative is chosen,

One alternative, of course, is to succumb to the

9

statute's mandate and to accept the change in the plan's

10

terms to include the mental health benefits specified in

11

the statute.

12

The other alternative is to give up all health

insurance, to operate as an uninsured plan so that the terms

of Section 47B can't take hold.

There was very vivid testimony, as Mr. Greenfield

2

3

mentioned, at the trial by James Dawson, an ex-plummer who

4

organized many of the early plans, benefit plans, in New

5

Hampshire.

6

were antagonistic and beligerent about the New Hampshire

mandated benefit law because they had to give up the vision

8

and the dental benefits that they really wanted to make

9

way for the mental health benefits which happened to be

10

New Hampshire union members, using his words,

something that they didn't want.
The second alternative, giving up insurance, has,

11
12

of course, undesirable consequences as well because many

13

plans can't safely operate without the protection and

14

stability of insurance and this is particularly true of

15

small and medium sized plans and particularly those in cyclicaL

16

industries like the construction industries in New England.

17

But, in the end the conflict with federal labor law doesn't

18

depend on which choice the parties make.

The conflict lies

19

in the state-imposed restriction on the parties' freedom

20

of choice, the state's interference with the parties' own

21

solution of a problem that Congress has required them to

22

solve.

MS. KELLY:

In the Commonwealth's view there are two issues
before the Court today.

First, is Section 47B a state

Second, did Congress intend that the National

47B?

6

As to these two questions I would like to make

7

three points.

8

Second, insurers press today for this Court to make policy

9

judgments.

First, Section 47B is a state insurance law.

Contrary to policy judgments and directives

10

already made by the Congress in plain language in ERISA,

11

the Commonwealth suggests that this Court should decline

12

the invitation.

14

And, third, federal labor policy does not

is a state insurance law?

16

prescribes minimum amounts of mental health benefits that

17

must be included in insurance policies in Massachusetts.

18

It unquestionably spreads the risk of mental health care

19

among all insureds in Massachusetts and in that sense it

20

is a reflection of a legislative judgment that the costs

21

of mental health care should be underwritten by insurance

22

policies and the risk of those costs should be shared.

23

First, in examining it, it

Second, Section 47B prescribes the term to be

It alters the voluntary market for

In each of these three respects, I would suggest

6

Section 47B fits squarely within the tradition of insurance

7

regulations discussed by this Court in SEC versus National

8

Securities, the classic case discussing the meaning of the

9

McCarran-Ferguson Act.

10

In this sense then the Commonwealth suggests

11

Section 47Bfits squarely within the tradition of insurance

12

regulation under the McCarran-Ferguson.

13

was enacted by the Congress in 1945 at the request of

14

insurance companies, I might add, declared that the states

15

would have primacy in the regulation of insurance in the

16

federal system.

17

That Act, which

Section 47B satisfies criteria this Court has

18

used in interpreting that Act constitutes the basis that

19

many state and federal courts have used to uphold mandated

20

benefit statutes very similar to Section 47B.

21

Now, turning to ERISA itself, we find a statute

22

enacted subsequent to the McCarran-Ferguson and after a

23

series of decisions by this Court defining insurance for

24

McCarran-Ferguson purposes.

25

ERISA contains four clauses of relevance today.
26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

First, there is ERISA's general preemption clause which

2

clearly, generally preempts all state laws that relate to

3

employee benefit plans, but that clause is followed by the

4

so-called insurance savings clause.

5

provided that, and I quote, "any law of any state which

6

regulates insurance," is excepted from ERISA's general

7

preemption scheme.

8
9

In this clause, Congress

The Commonwealth believes that this clause con­
stitutes an explicit reaffirmation of the McCarran-Ferguson

10

Act's directive that the states are to have primacy in the

11

regulation of insurance.

12

Third, the third clause in ERISA is the so-called

13

deemer clause.

14

from carrying on historical practice of directly seeking

15

to regulating employee benefit plans.

16

in that sense functions as a remedy for the historic practice

17

by the states.

18

In that clause Congress prohibited the states

The deemer clause

The fourth clause of relevance in ERISA is an

19

explicit affirmation of existing federal law.

20

tains a clause that says ERISA shall not be construed so

21

as to alter, amend, modify, invalid, impair or supercede

22

any other federal law.

23

The Commonwealth suggests that the preexisting

24

McCarran-Ferguson Act was thus explicitly reaffirmed in

25

the ERISA preemption scheme.

1

And, while it is undoubtedly true that in ERISA

2

Congress sought to broadly preempt state law, Congress with

3

very plain language clearly excepted state insurance laws

4

from the broad preemption scheme.

5

QUESTION:

Can you contribute anything to our

6

understanding, Ms. Kelly, about why this insurance modifi­

7

cation of the general preemption section was enacted by

8

Congress?

9

MS. KELLY:

Your Honor, on that point I would

10

say that the legislative history, while scant on the subject

11

of the insurance savings clause, recognizes that Congress

12

intended that there be certain exceptions to the broad

13

preemption scheme.

14

is quite clear that ERISA's main focus is on pension

15

regulation.

16

17

At the same time I would add that it

Welfare benefit plans receive much less

We suggest in our brief that one reason for this

18

less regulation is that Congress understood that the states

19

were going to continue their usual role of regulating insurance

20

companies and thereby providing significant protection to

21

employee welfare plan holders who receive benefits through

22

the purchase of insurance.

I would like to discuss three of those policy

2

insurance policies must provide through its regulation of

4

MS. KELLY:

of other laws regulating pregnancy benefits, the state might

seek to enact a law that provided a certain minimum amount

7

of coverage for pregnancy.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

How would you then reconcile that with

the Shaw case?
MS. KELLY:

The Commonwealth believes that in

11

Shaw the Court was dealing with an exception from the ERISA

12

preemption scheme for disability benefit plans.

13

ERISA scheme, disability benefit plans, which is what Shaw

14

was concerned with, are separate from ERISA.

17

Excuse me, a law that was enacted by a state legislature

saying that the state disability laws were to include a

19

specific amount of pregnancy benefits would in its entirety

20

be exempt from ERISA.

21

But, the law before the Court today --

22

QUESTION:

But, the state could operate indirectly

23

insofar as insurance policies are issued by requiring the

24

same thing in a way.

25

MS. KELLY:

In a sense the state cculd, although
30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

to my knowledge, the pregnancy benefits are usually provided

2

in disability insurance laws which, as I say, are exempt

3

from ERISA coverage in their entirety.

4

But, Justice O'Connor, there is no doubt that

5

in ERISA Congress enacted an exception in the insurance

6

savings clause that allows insurance laws to indirectly

7

control the content of employee benefit plans.
The Commonwealth has never denied that and, in

8
9

fact, argues strenuously that that is something that Congress

10

enacted and it is for Congress to change that if it becomes

11

a problem.

12

There is no evidence in this case that through

13

the indirect regulation of insured employee benefit plans

14

that is operative because of the insurance savings clause

15

any employee in the United States has been injured, any

16

employee welfare has gone bankrupt, or any employee welfare

17

plan has gone to self insurance.

18

Indeed, in this case, the trial judge noted quite

19

extensively in his findings that the arguments regarding

20

indirect regulation had in a sense constituted a failure

21

of proof on the part of the insurers in this case.

22

simply proved no injury based on indirect regulation.

23

They

If the Court again reads traditional into ERISA

24

the Court will also, in our view, be opening the flood gates

25

to litigation.

A torrent of cases will ensue asking this

1

Court and other lower courts to decide the boundaries of

2

traditional insurance regulation.

3

The Commonwealth suggests that insurance regulation

4

has always been a state law function and should remain as

5

such.

6

In any event, in our view, it is clear that Section

7

47B is a traditional insurance law, for tradition in insurance

8

regulation extends quite clearly to content control.

9

are many examples of this type of state insurance law and

There

10

one that we would offer to the Court would be auto insurance

11

laws.

12

quite clearly are content control laws and they are traditiona

13

insurance laws.

14

therefore, there is no need for this Court to read a gloss

15

on to the savings clause nor would any purpose be served

16

by it.

In our state, Massachusetts, auto insurance laws

They have been around for a long time,

And, as Justice O'Connor pointed out in a question

5

the country in benefit plans.

leads

6

Obviously state laws regulating, for example,

7

premiums that insurers pay will have an impact on plans

8

in particular states.

9

These significant non-uniformities are the result

10

of Congress' explicit leaving of insurance regulation to

11

the states.

12

In the Commonwealth's view, Congress created

13

uniformity in the area of pension and welfare, reporting,

14

disclosure, and fiduciary standards in ERISA.

15

As to questions regarding these areas, in ERISA

16

Congress clearly said there will be one answer and it will

17

be a uniform federal answer.

18

But, as this Court noted in Shaw, ERISA is

19

absolutely silent as to the content of employee welfare

20

plans.

21

The insurers press another policy argument on

22

this Court. That is the so-called self-insurance issue.

23

Insurers suggest that self-insurance is promoted by 47B

24

in that promotion of self-insurance is contrary to the intent

25

of Congress in enacting ERISA.

Again, the Commonwealth

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

believes that the insurers are simply incorrect.

Congress

2

in ERISA clearly contemplated that welfare benefits could

3

be provided, and I quote, "through the purchase of insurance

4

or otherwise."
There is an absolute failure of proof by the insurer 3

5

6

that the statute at issue today promotes self-insurance,

7

has harmed any employee, or led to the bankruptcy of any

8

plan.

9

not prove at trial, that self-insurance is some sort of

The insurers instead seek to argue what they could

10

an evil, that this Court should in a sense rewrite ERISA

11

to make sure that self-insurance not occur in this country

12

in employee welfare plans.
But, I would suggest self-insurance is an evil

13
14

only for insurance companies for there is an absolute failure

15

of proof that any employee welfare plan has been injured

16

by self-insurance and obviously it is clear that where a

17

plan goes to self-insurance insurance companies lose their

18

profits.

19

Finally, any tendency to self-insurance promoted

20

by ERISA is for the Congress to address and not this Court

21

and for the Congress to alter and not this Court.

22

sense the Commonwealth believes that the insurers are in

23

the wrong forum to make that argument.

24
25

In that

Finally, I would like to address the labor question
before the Court today.

can regulate insurance purchased to provide benefits to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY GREENFIELD, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT — REBUTTAL

3

MR. GREENFIELD:

Justice Stevens asked a question

4

about self-insurance.

5

a dramatic increase in self-insurance over the past few

6

years.

I would note that there has been

This is pointed out in our brief.

7

One of the cases that my friend did not mention

8

but which is quite important in this area is Alessi.

9

the position argued by the Commonwealth effectively permits

10

Now,

the overruling of Alessi by a state.

11

In Alessi, as the Court will recall, New Jersey

12

has a statute which said that you could not set off workmen's

13

compensation against benefits from an ERISA plan.

14

Court said that that was preempted and indirect regulation

15

was just as bad as direct regulation.

16

This

If New Jersey passed a statute which said that,

17

every insurance policy shall provide, that there shall be

18

no setoff as a result of a workmen's compensation recovery,

19

then, according to my friend, that would come within the

20

savings clause and New Jersey could do it and Alessi become

21

meaningless.

22

The state commanded absolutely everything.

I want, in about the minute or so remaining, just

23

to talk about regulatory vacuum as if this was something

24

terrible.

25

My friend finished up mentioning that.
What regulatory vacuum means is that the employers

and employees pick the benefits they need and are willing

2

to pay for.

3

the insurance companies, speaking about public policy, the

4

fact is that in this case the line up of amici is that on

5

our side is the AFL-CIO, all the major employers, and a

6

lot of small unions, the people who pay for this, the people

7

who get it, are the people who want to pick their own bene­

8

fits and that is what the preemption clause is designed

9

to do.

And while we have heard words of irony about
