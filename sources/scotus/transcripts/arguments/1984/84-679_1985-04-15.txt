CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. WARREN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

MR. WARREN:

10
11
12

This case presents the issue of whether a
tippee who knowingly receives inside information in
breach of fiduciary duty,

intending to use it to defraud

others, may in turn sue his tipper under Section 10 of
the Securities Exchange Act.

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

8

9

I think you

may proceed whenever you are ready.

5

7

Mr. Warren,

The case arose in the context of a suit before
the United States District Court in San Francisco.

A

15

Judge Schwarzer dismissed the action on motion on the

16

basis of the following critical allegations of the

17

complaint.

18

The Plaintiffs alleged that they had inve sted

19

in a company known as TONM that was engaged in

20

exploration for gold in Surinam,

21

22

23
24
25

They said tha t th ey

did so by obtaining information directly or ind ir ec tiy
through the Defendant broker of a number of mat ter s , but
the following was the essential point, and that was that
there was a developed gold find in Surinam, and tha t
there would shortly be announced a joint ventur e wi th a

2

f ind .

3

The complaint recites that they were told that

4

this was inside information obtained from a president or

5

a vice president of TONM.

6

shares of stock in TONM over a period of time from

7

November 1979 until 1981 on the premise that this was

8

inside information from that source.

10

QUESTION:

They said that they purchased

Was that a violation of the

securities laws?

11

MR. WARREN:

At that particular point there is

12

a suggestion that it would be, Mr. Chief Justice.

13

However, it was confirmed by what happened in or about

14

april of 1980 when they contacted Mr. Neadeau directly.

15

Mr. Neadeau was alleged to be the president of TONM, and

16

they asked Mr. Neadeau whether this information that

17

they had learned from the broker, Mr. Lazzaro, was true,

18

and they were told by Mr. Neadeau as follows:

19

that he could not confirm or deny that information;

20

second, he told them why, because it was not yet

21

public.

22

said you will have to wait until you see the annual

23

report.

24
25

first,

Then he told them when it would be public.

And then to make sure that there was no
misunderstanding, that the information might be

He

inaccurate, he told them that Mr. Lazzaro, the broker,

2

was a very trustworthy and a good man.

3
4

QUESTION:

And you suggest that was a signal

that in effect was a violation of the act?

5

MR. WARREN:

Exactly.

I suggest that the

6

following is true, that under the analysis of this Court

7

in Dirks, that that conduct, their subsequent trading

8

with that information, that inside information, was in

9

fact a violation of Section 10 of the Act, for the

10

following reasons.

11

The duty in question is derivative from Mr.

12

Neadeau.

13

responsibility.

14

fiduciary responsibility to his stockholders not to

15

selectively tell a broker and that broker's customers so

16

that that broker's customers could trade, that broker

17

could earn commissions, that broker's own stock could be

18

benefitted -- and these parties were told about the

19

stock of Mr. Lazzaro and his family.

20

Mr. Neadeau is the person with the fiduciary
As President of that company he had a

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Warren, is the tippee

21

liable derivatively through Lazzaro or directly, in your

22

view, from Mr. Neadeau?

23
24
25

MR. WARREN:

The tippee here, Justice

O'Connor, is liable both directly from Mr. Neadeau,
through the contact with Mr. Neadeau, and derivatively
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

by virtue of being, if you will, a subtippee from Mr.

2

Lazzaro, knowing of Mr. Neadeau's involvement or of some

3

counterpart of Mr. Neadeau.

4

5

QUESTION:

We have to look at this based on

the face of the complaint, do we not?

6

MR. WARREN:

7

QUESTION:

Exactly we do.
And the complaint does not say, of

8

course, how Mr. Lazzaro got his information or what it

9

was that Mr. Neadeau told Mr. Lazzaro, if anything.

10
11
12

13
14
15
16
17

MR. WARREN:

That is correct.

All we know

is —
QUESTION:

it could be a total fabrication by

Mr. Lazzaro that he was told anything by Mr. Neadeau.
MR. WARREN:

It could have been.

However,

what we know is that the belief -QUESTION:

Well, just looking at the face of

the complaint, that could be true, could.it not?

18

MR. WARREN:

19

QUESTION:

That could be true.

It —

And therefore, no derivative

20

liability of the tippee through Mr. Lazzaro from the

21

face of the complaint alone.

22

MR. WARREN:

Not on the basis of what the

23

facts are as the Plaintiffs assumed them to be.

24

that's what we must look at in deciding whether they

25

either committed or attempted to commit a violation of
6

(202) 628-9300

And

1

2

Section 10
QUESTION:

And whet is it that Mr. Neadeau

3

said directly to the tippee that you say imposes this

4

liability on the part of the tippee?

5

MR. WARREN:

First, the Plaintiffs allege, and

6

they allege this as a charging allegation, so it is

7

assumed that this was an important statement to them and

8

one that they deemed important in determining to go upon

9
10
11

this acquisition program of stock -- they said they told
Mr. Neadeau that they were dealing with Mr. Lazzaro and
that they wanted to confirm certain information, and

12

they said in the complaint that what they wanted to

13

confirm was the gold strike in Surinam and the

14

prospectige joint venture with St. Joe's.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

I thought the complaint discloses

that Mr. Neadeau refused to confirm or deny that.
MR. WARREN:

The complaint alleges a statement

18

by Mr. Neadeau that the Plaintiffs allege misled them

19

into believing that they had inside information and a

20

jump on every other TONM shareholder in that he made a

21

statement to them that they allege in their complaint --

22

it must be to make it a charging allegation -- was a

23

clever confirmation while nonconfirming.

24
25

They said that

he said yes, that he couldn't confirm or deny, but the
realities were that when he said the reason he couldn't
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

confirm or deny was because the information was not yet
v

2

public, they would have to wait for that annual report

3

to see that, but he did want to tell them that Mr.

4

Lazzaro was a very trustworthy and good man.

5

There is only one inference from that, and if

6

that is not -- if that is not an improper transmission

7

by Mr. Neadeau, then in the brokerage industry I believe

8

they are going to talk about somewbody being

9

Neadeaulized because that is nothing more than a ploy,

10

at least as they allege it, that's their charge, a ploy

11

to indicate that they had inside information, an unfair

12

jump on the TONM shareholders.
And they say that they acted on it.

13

They say

14

in reliance on it, on the premise that they had inside

15

information, they bought from other shareholders, and

16

they bought at two, they bought with an advance

17

knowledge of market conditions, and they did in fact

18

watch the stock over a period of time from November of

19

1979 up to the first quarter of 1981, and indeed, in the

20

last quarter of 1980, hit a high water mark of seven.

21

So based upon the information, the jumps that

22

they thought they had, they did indeed have a jump.

23

They

24

and had they sold at that point, they would have

25

actually achieved the results of their contemplated

they held.

The stock did not pan

A public announcement was made contrary to the

inside information announcing that the joint venture
wouldn't go through;

the stock went down.

So it is our position that on those facts, as
disclosed on the face of the complaint, that Plaintiffs
were guilty of a 10(b) (5)

violation.

Now, it is understood that -QUESTION:

In your view, Mr. Warren, would the

in pari delicto defense always be available then to a
tippee who voluntarily trades on what is represented to
be insider information?
MR. WARREN:
here,

I believe that if the tippee, as

is put in the position to understand that the

information was received from a corporate insider with a
fiduciary duty not to disclose it selectively, and as
here,

they know that it has been disclosed selectively

for the purpose of causing the customers of a certain
broker to enjoy an unfair advantage, yes.

If all they

are told is we have some inside information,

I think one

can say at that point you don't know enough to know
whether a Dirks duty has in fact been breached or has
not.

Here we do.
QUESTION:

Do you think it is correct to say
9
AI.DERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

that at common law, the in pari delicto defense was
available in an action for fraud?
MR. WARREN:

Yes.

When the conduct which is

the equal fault is itself fraud.

In other words,

obviously if we have a gambling game where someone has
gambled, and that is their fault, they have gambled
against the state law and they are cheated with marked
cards, then you don't have equal fault because one
person has a fraudulent intent and the other person just
intends to gamble, a small matter.
Here, these people are alleged to have had the
identical intent.

Here it is alleged that Mr. Neadeau

and Mr. Lazzaro intended to commit a 10(b) (5)
violation.

They intended to defraud the market.
QUESTION:

By what?

MR. WARREN:
QUESTION:

I beg your pardon?
By passing out false information or

what, or by -- or withholding information?
MR. WARREN:

They allege that the Defendants

were engaged in what they call manipulation of the
market.

At one point they had a Section 9 claim as

well, but that was dismissed by virtue of nontimely
filing.
QUESTION:

So if equal -- if close to equal

fault is essential for the defense to be invoked, what
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

is the difference between — is there some difference

2

between these -- the tipper, the tipster and the tippee,

3

in this case?

4

MR. WARREN:

Not a meaningful difference, in

5

our view, because they each intended according to the

6

allegations of the complaint as we read them to commit a

7

fraud on stockholders.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, they also -- they also

intended to use inside information.

10

MR. WARREN:

11

QUESTION:

Well so did the tipster.

12

QUESTION:

Both of them.

13

MR. WARREN:

The tippees?

Oh, the tipster to use in side

14

information.

15

information is not true, that the tipster was passing a

16

wrong that information.

17

Well, they allege that the inside

QUESTION:

Well, then, the tipster not only

18

was purporting to use inside information, but he was

19

also lying.

20
21

MR. WARREN:

And says, I believe, the Dirks --

I'm sorry.

22

QUESTION:

And the tippee, the tippee didn't

23

lie to anybody, he just didn't tell them what the facts

24

were .

25

MR. WARREN:

Well, I don't -- I suggest that
11

(202) 628-9300

1

the difference between an actionable misrepresentation

2

under 10(b) (5) and an actionable nondisclosure such as

3

an affiliated ute under 10(b) (5) are indistinguishable.

4

Obviously —

5

6
7

8
9

QUESTION:

Yes, but the tipster might be stuck

under state law for defrauding somebody.
MR. WARREN:

The tipster might be stuck under

state law for defrauding somebody, of course.
QUESTION:

He wouldn't be — but the tippee

10

wouldn't be committing a state law offense by just

11

not -- just by saying caveat emptor.

MR. WARREN:

Oh, I -- perhaps I am unduly

California, but I don't think that could be --

MR. WARREN:

17

You have statutory.
I don't think that could be said

in the State of California.

QUESTION:

You have statutory remedies.

19

MR. WARREN:

Well, we have, yes, we have a --

20

yes, we are a code state.

21

developed case law in California, and we have duties of

22

when it is necessary to disclose in order not to commit

23

fraud, and I believe that this Court has drawn upon

24

common law concepts as to those duties to disclose.

QUESTION:

So the tippee Wants to buy some

stock from some stockholder because he thinks the stock
is going up.

He just doesn't tell him why he thinks the

5

stock is going up, that would be his -- would give the

6

seller of the stock a remedy under state law?

7

MR. WARREN:

No * but if he, if he had gone to

8

a corporate insider with a fiduciary duty to that

9

shareholder that he is going to go buy it from --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. WARREN:

I understand that.
-- and he gets told something by

12

that corporate insider that is not to be revealed and is

13

a breach of duty to do so, and he then goes and buys

14

that stock and he doesn't disclose, yes, I believe

15

indeed he is guilty of actual fraud.

16

guilty of actual fraud under common law, under state

17

law, and under the federal securities laws.

18

QUESTION:

I believe he is

If this stock had gone to 28 and

19

then this fellow had sold it and made a very large

20

profit, would it be subject to some vulnerability on the

21

part of others?

22

MR. WARREN:

Would the plaintiffs here be

23

subject to vulnerability to a suit by others?

24

indeed, I believe so.

25

QUESTION:

Yes,

Now, as I read the District judge,
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

he said he wasn't going to get into a fine tuned
weighing of quantitative dishonesty, quantitative fraud,
quantitative violations of the Securities Act, that he
was going to weigh and did weigh what he thought was the
qualitative violations, and he thought qualitatively
they were in the same boat.
Isn't that about it?
MR. WARREN:

That is correct.

I believe that

is exactly the fact, that the dollars weren't as
important as the offense which was committed and the
state of mind with which it was committed.
Now, we believe that if we are correct that
there indeed was a fraud and attempted fraud committed
by the plaintiffs then they should be barred because,
first, the defense of in pari delicto is a part of the
statutory law of the securities laws; second, it is
based upon rational, reasonable and publicly accepted
considerations; and third, the government here has
failed in any respect to show that its enforcement will
inhibit the enforcement of the securities laws.
First, as to the legislative point, Rule 10 is
based upon the statutory section 10 which simply
prohibits manipulative and deceptive practices.

As

such, if construed to have a private remedy, it is a
very general, federal tort standard with the contours to
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

be set by the court

2
3
4

In Briscoe v. LaHue, however it is correctly
pronounced, it was said that when Congress passes such a
very general federal tort even for very good and

5

important purposes such as the civil rights statutes, it

6

is presumed to be aware of the common law land the

7

existing of common law defenses and to accept them into

8

that tort structure.

9

This is particularly appropriate with regard

10

to Section 10 because of the savings clauses that are

11

found in Section 16 of the '33 act and 28 of the '34 act

12

which accept common law remedies and deem them to

13

continue in effect.

14

The federal courts uniformly, in applying

15

Section 10, have adopted common law defenses based upon

16

the conduct of plaintiffs, for example, laches, waiver,

17

estoppel, ratification, consent, limitations, all of

18

those based upon conduct by the plaintiffs have been

19

accepted.

20

federal courts have applied in pari delicto in

21

securities actions, and indeed, in the Kuehnert case in

22

1969, applied it to an action much like that here, also

23

involving the tipper/tippee type of situation.

24
25

One of them has been in pari delicto.

QUESTION:

Mr. Warren, can I interrupt with

one question?

MR. WARREN:

2

QUESTION:

Yes,

sir

I guess one of the problems is what

3

really is equal fault in cases of this kind, and if I

4

understand your colloquy with Justice White, you say it

5

really doesn't make any difference whether the tipster

6

was telling the truth or not;

7

equally bad.

8

MR. WARREN:

9

QUESTION:

in either event it is

Yes -Is that -- in other words,

10

supposing you had a case in which a tipster — a broker

11

says to a customer,

12

the company and they are about to buy a gold mine, and

13

in one case that is just no basis in fact for it;

14

other case it's totally true.

I would say in neither case could

the customer recover, and if it is true, of course, as

pointed out in Kuehnert and pointed out in Tarasi,

likely that there will be no need to worry about the

MR. WARREN:

3

QUESTION:

I don't know

There's that possibility.
So that at the time of the

4

transaction, though, everybody was dealing in at least

5

not a false way.

6

You say there is no difference between the ase

7

where he tells the truth and the one where the broker

8

lies.

9

MR. WARREN:

Oh, well, in the former case, we

10

also will leave out now the wealthy because it didn't

pan out.

12

part of the defendant, we can also forget about it

13

because there is no cause of action.

to trade on inside information.

false inside information; in the second case it's true.

19

MR. WARREN:

20

QUESTION:

In the one case it is

Yes.
And it seems to me that one could

21

make a stronger argument that when everybody thought it

22

was true but they just thought they would make a little

23

money on the side, that you would say they are equally

24
25

guilty, but it is a little different if he — I just —
if one of them is lying and the other one didn't realize

1

it

2

MR. WARREN:

I understand, Justice Stevens,

3

but I don't think, still, in your first postulate, there

4

would be any cause of action at all because the two

5

parties may have engaged in inside trading, but there

6

would be no relationship between the inside trading and

7

the loss.

8

tip would not have a cause of action against the party

9

who gave the tip because of the concept of inside

10
11

In other words, the party who received the

trading, there would be no deception.
QUESTION:

But there would be -- isn't it a

12

violation of the securities law to give inside

13

information in that situation?

14

MR. WARREN:

Perhaps insofar as the SEC is

15

concerned, but not insofar as a private right of action

16

is concerned.

17

It's clear that the plaintiffs

had every reason to believe that he was acting for

at.

6

QUESTION:

Well, did Dirks look at what the

requirement that the tipster be acting for personal

that Mr. Lazzaro told them that he had in side

question?

Do we judge this case, or does the record

show, or are there findings as to whether or not the

tipster here conveyed both true and false information or

10

only true or only false?

11

MR. WARREN:

All right.

The fact is that the

12

comparison of I believe it is paragraphs 16 and 33 of

13

the complaint, 16 being the representations, and 33

14

being the falsity, shows that we have a mixture, in

other words, that they don't contend there wasn't any

17

They don't contend that there were no joint venture

19

alleges, was a planned -- a plan conceived by the

1

MR. KNUDSEN:

2

QUESTION:

3

Pardon me?

That he was -- the narrowness of,

the scope of the fraud.

4

MR. KNUDSEN:

Well, the scope of the fraud, as

5

alleged in the complaint, would have some effect in

6

terms of interpreting whether the Plaintiffs could be

7

considered to be of equal fault or in pari delicto, but

8

the complaint itself is meant to alleged a -- just a

9

fraud 10(b) (5) violation in the context of a market

10

manipulation, and that the plaintiffs were injured by

11

it.

12

What makes it a little bit different is that

13

the complaint alleges that the Plaintiffs, who ended up

14

losig their money, were utilized as an instrumentality

15

of the Defendants' fraud.

1G

intent of the Defendants to provide intentionally false

17

information alleged to be inside to the Plaintiffs.

18

They initiated the contact, they did it for purposes of

19

having the Plaintiffs trade, driving the price of the

20

stock up.

21

In other words, it was the

They never intended the Plaintiffs to benefit

22

from that market manipulation, and in fact, as the

23

Complaint alleges, when the Plaintiffs indicated some

24

desire to sell when the stock got up at its higher

25

levels, they continued the fraud so that they would

(202) 628-9300

1

continue to hold on to their stock by saying, wait, it

2

will go higher, it will go higher.

3

So it is not a situation where the Defendants

4

and the Plaintiffs embarked upon a conspiracy to somehow

5

utilize inside information.

where the defendants are alleged to have embarked upon a

scheme to defraud the market and defraud these

the face of the complaint, assuming that you read the

make that determination of in pari delicto.

to trade on inside information, that he may be guilty of

a violation, but concluded in the circumstances of the

Which at common law, if you have

21

an actual fraud and the determination, there is a public

22

policy issue if withholding the relief would do more to

offend public morals, then in pari delicto would not

apply, and that is the situation that the 9th Circuit

addressed and said if there is a fraud aimed at these

Plaintiffs and aimed at the market, then to withhold
relief or to withhold the opportunity to pursue their
claim would be more offensive in the concept of — in
the context of in pari delicto.
QUESTION:

Do you agree with your friend's

response when I put to him this question, that if this
stock had gone up to 28 and then this gentleman sold out
at 28, would you be subject to a claim for recovery from
them, and then after that it dropped to where it did
drop, 1 or less?
Would the purchasers of that stock have been
able to recover from this fellow?
MR. KNUDSEN:

I'm into Justice White's problem

in the sense that if you read that there is some true
inside information or nonpublc information and some
false, and the stock goes to 28 based on an activity of
trading, and then there is this true information about
the gold find, yes, there would be liability.

The

Complaint was meant to alleged a market manipulation
that did not involve true information, or at most,
partially true information solely for purposes of market
manipulation.

market manipulation here?

Well, to the extent my client is

engaged in wrongdoing may not depend on that at all

22

unless you look at it in the context of perhaps this

to look at a duty to disclose, and then the question

comes up how can you have a -- how could the insider

is the very thing you don't want to happen, but in

QUESTION:

Sure.

Then I will get it all off my

chest.
Supposing your theory -- I realize you are

relying on a fraud theory, but supposing you had a case

19

in which a plaintiff just said he got inside information

20

which he relied on and was true and so forth and so on,

21

but the stock didn't — the deal fell through and the

22

stock didn't go up as much as he expected it.

Do you think the Plaintiff has a cause of
action there?

Your opponent says no, there is no cause

of action absent fraud.

the Defendant that would be required by Ernst & Ernst

for a 10(b) violation, I agree.

He would know he is deal -- he is

not to do so.

QUESTION:

Everyone is telling the truth.

You trade on it, and the stock goes

Does the customer of the stock broker have a

2

MR. KNUDSEN:

No, I don't believe so because

3

of the scienter requirement for -- because it is not an

4

insider -- he doesn't have a claim for insider trading.

5

If he has a claim against a broker for anything, it is

6

for fraud under 10(b) (5) , and that would require

7

scienter, which would require some intentionally false

or recklessly false information imparted to him, and

your hypothetical is it is true.

MR. KUHLIK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

24

I would like to focus on what the Commission

25

believes is the dispositive factor in this litigation,
40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

and that is the furtherance of the public interest in

2

deterring violations of the federal securities laws.

3

We think that there can be no doubt that

4

allowing this lawsuit to go forward in the circumstances

5

as we now believe them to be will further, will best

6

further the deterrence of violations of Section 10(b)

7

and Rule 10 (b) (5) .

8
9
10
11

Now, deterrence of wrongdoing is an important
component of the in pari delicto defense as it has
developed at common law.

The courts engaged in a

flexible balancing of relative fault in order to

12

determine which party was the primary wrongdoer who

13

should be deterred in the first instance, and we think

14

that in the federal regulatory scheme presented in this

15

case where private actions such as those under Rule

16

10(b) , or excuse me, Rule 10(b) (5) , makes an important

17

contribution to enforcement of the federal securities

18

laws.

19

Mufflers which held the defense unavailable in a private

20

action under the antitrust laws because the defense

21

would not further the deterrent purpose of the Sherman

24
25

We think that the Court's decision in Perma Life

and Clayton Act, we think that that case requires that
the defense be applied here only if it will further the
purposes of the securities laws.
Now, I would like to turn first to the

allowing the lawsuit to go forward will deter brokerage

not there is some other overriding factor on the other

side in terms of perhaps encouraging wrongdoing by

11

I say, override this deterrent impact on the brokers.

12

And we think that that overriding factor on the other

13

side just isn't present.

14

In the Commission's view, allowing this action

15

to go forward will not unduly encourage illegal tippee

trading.

22

of the Plaintiffs, in the Commission's view, are often

unsophisticated, certainly as compared with the

25

they were unsophisticated, unschooled in the law, and we

2

are far more likely to respond to the deterrent impact

of not allowing the defense here than ordinary investors

would be to the deterrent impact on their trading of

allowing the defense.

MR. KUHLIK:

I think when tippees consider

whether to trade on inside information, they do not
consider seriously the possibility of recovery in court
if the information turns out to be false.

information believing there to be a substantial

6

possibility that the whole information is false, simply

7

on the chance, just the chance that they might recover

8

later in a legal action.

9

QUESTION:

1

So your submission is that we ought

10

to just, in this case at least, forget the notion of

11

equal fault?

12

MR. KUHLIK:

13

QUESTION:

No, Justice White, I believe -I should say that no matter whether

14

they are equal or not, enforcement of the securities

15

laws is so important that the defense should not be

16

allowed.

17

MR. KUHLIK:

My position is that the

18

enforcement of the securities laws is so important that

19

the defense should only be allowed where it will further

20

the purposes of the securities laws, even if in a

21

particular case the fault of the parties were relatively

equal.

position in the scheme of the capital market system and

6

in the scheme of the enforcement of the securities laws

QUESTION:

that that caused a trading loss to some other group of

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. KUHLIK:

Because, well, of a number of

2

factors.

3

because they are the people who instigated the fraud

4

here

5

plaintiff investors, engaged them in a scheme, abused

6

their position of trust to make them believe that they

7

were trading on inside information when in fact it was

8

the plaintiffs all along who were the intended victims,

9

excuse me, and the actual victims of the fraud, and in

10

this regard, I might add that the brokers and insiders

11

such as those here, in the Commission's view, have a

12

much greater opportunity to jeopardize the integrity of

13

the market systems.

14

to come into inside information, to represent or to

15

misrepresent to their clients, to their friends, to

16

their investors that they have access to this sort of

17

information.

18

Because of their special position, but also

20

to these markets . If a plaintiff wants to trade, he has

21

to do it through a broker, and it is up to the brokers

22

to be — they are required to be conversant with the

23

law, to be conversant with Commission rules, regulations

24

and the statute, and it is up to them in the first

25

instance to guide the trading of their clients into

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

lawful channels

2

And that position of trust was abused here.

3

And if the Commission is to be able to uncover

4

these sorts of frauds perpetrated on investors, the only

5

realistic way for most of these frauds to come to light

6

is through private actions such as these, and I think

7

there can be no doubt that the investors would have

8

little incentive indeed to bring these sorts of actions

9

to light because by doing so, they expose themselves to

10

possible criminal and civil sanctions.

11

So without the incentive of recovering their

12

investment, it is most, most unlikely that these sorts

13

of frauds would be uncovered.

14

And finally, we would note in regard to the

15

position of the parties here, that in the Commission's

16

view, the in pari delicto defense should be available in

17

those securities actions where the plaintiffs, perhaps

18

the investors, have instigated an illegal scheme, are

19

truly involved in a conspiracy with a broker for their

20

mutual benefit.

21

22
23
24
25

But that is not what we have here.

That is why I would like to turn then to the
comparative fault of the parties.
The Petitioner claims that under the common
law, a plaintiff who is guilty of fraud is barred from
recovering under the in pari delicto doctrine under all

Could I ask you in this connection,

they knew it to be false, and they passed it out to the
