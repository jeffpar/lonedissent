17

MR. ALITO;

When ycu’re dealing with

what is the statutory scurce

I think it stems from 501 which

18

authorizes the Agency to issue regulations necessary to

19

implement the Act, and I think it stems from two

20

potentially conflicting statutory commands in the Clean

21

Water Act, namely,

22

categorical basis, and then to do it based or. factors

23

that vary significantly among seemingly similar plants.

24

There is tension between these two statutory commands,

25

and the FDF variance mechanism, I think, is a

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

permissible way of reconciling that.
I think in th DuPcnt case, this Court

2
3

recognized that the FDF variance was an appropriate and

4

perhaps even a necessary mechanism in the BPT context,

5

and I see no reason to draw'a distinction between BF1

6

and and BAT in pre-treatment in this area.

7

statutory authority is the same, and EFA's practical

8

problem is the same:

I think the center of the Third Circuit's

misunderstanding was its inability to understand the

variances.

The statutory modifications do scmethina very

Under 501(c) a facility may be eligible for

4

a modification if it can show, not that there was ary

5

mistake in the effluent limitation, but that it car't

6

affcrd compliance.
If I can return to my example where BAT was

7

8

calculated tc cost between three-guarters cf a million

9

and a

million dollars,

if a plant came in and said,

"I

10

can’t ccrrply because I can’t afford three quarters of a

11

million dollars," it would be ineligible for an FDF

12

variance, but it might be eligible for a 301(c)

13

modifi cation.
Similarly, under Section 301(g), a facility

14
15

may be eligible for a ir cdif ica t io n based on the quality

16

of the water into which it is making its discharge.

17

that is a fact that EFA may not consider in setting its

18

technology-base effluent limitations.

Now

Once this difference between statutory

19

20

modifications and FDF variances is understood, this

21

Court

22

explained it at some length in the National Crushed

23

Stone case -- One this difference is understood, then x

1

said, as we believe it did, that statutory modifications

2

are prohibited for toxic pollutants, but that FDF

3

variances are available for all pollutants, because the

4

FDF variance just corrects a mistake, and whether that

5

mistake has to do with a toxic pollutant, or any ether

6

pollutant, it should be corrected.

7

But the statutory modification --

21

3

because it would not have shewn that the Agency did not

consider the proper range cf factors, only that the

I think that is the distinction Congress drew

in

1977.

The issue in this case, of course, is the

meaning of 301(1), which prohibits modifications of

As I said,

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT CF FFANCES DUBRCWSKI, ESQ.
ON EEHAIF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. DUBRCWSKI;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
The issue here is a very straightforward one.
Can EP A grant variances from national pre-treatment
standards for toxic pollutants?
Congress amended the Clean Water Act in 1977
to strengthen EPA's ability to regulate toxics.

it

identified BAT and pre-treatment standards as the key
elements of a toxic control strategy.

It carefully

considered when and under what conditions EPA could
grant variances from these standards, and each time it
considered the idea of a variance for toxics, it
rejected it.

At the same time. Congress enacted 3C1(1)

of the law, which tells EPA in broad and unqualified
language not to modify any EAT for pre-treatment
standard for toxics.
EPA urges this Court to take a very narrow
reading of 301(1).

EPA says thar the broad ban on

variances in that section was intended to apply to the
statutory variances from BAT that Congress had created.

Also during the rulemaking, EPA cannot
categorize sources cn the tasis of cost, the way it
purports to do in an FDF variance.

All sources must

come up to the level of the hest performer, that means
that some sources will have higher costs than others.
Congress anticipated that, and it was envisioned in BAT
that that would happen.
If you could subcategorize on the basis of
cost, you wouldn’t need a 3C1(c) variance, you wouldn't
need reference in the legislative history to fact that
sources might close, or that everyone had to come up to
the level of the best performer because the
subcategorization would take care of that.

EPA cannot

would allow it to do.

It must, for each source,

category as a whole.
The new sources standards in the Act are not
subject to variances as this Court held in CuFcnt.
Those standards can be revised from time to time to
reflect new developments in technology.

In fact,

Congress used the same language to tell EPA to revise
new source standards as it did to tell EPA to revise the
pre-treatment standards.

Congress would have gone to that detail if, as EPA

maintains, it intended to leave open the question of

Congress read DuPont the way EPA does, so that DuPont

strange that Congress would not have said, in enacting

its subsection (1), we want to be very clear here to

draw a distinction tc say that this is not intended to

wanted these standards tc be uniform, cr as uniform as

The FDF variance also thwarts that goal of

of the statute through the change of Administration.

that sense, it is very different from Chevron.

In

Chevron, the Agency had an interpretation of the statute

which

preceded the reauthorization.

4

Here the interpretation of the statute, prior

to the

would indicate, is directly contrary to what EPA said it

could dc after the reauthorization, that is, before

EPA granted FEF variances only from BPT, and the

variances.
