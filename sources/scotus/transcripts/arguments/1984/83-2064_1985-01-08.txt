ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL, ESQ.

ON EEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. McCONNELL:

and may it please the Court;
This case, like the last one, arises from an

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

attempt by the Secretary of Education

to recover federal

10

Title I funds spent by a state in violation of its grant

11

agreement.

12

here is one entered into between the State of New Jersey

13

and the federal Office cf Education in 1971, whereby New

14

Jersey received some $52 million In federal funds, in

15

return

16

spend those funds in accordance with Title I and the

17

implementing regulations.

for which it provided assurances that it would

QUESTION;

19

The grant agreement principally involved

Was that a formal commitment, Mr.

McCcnn ell?
MR. McCONNELL;

20

It was, Justice Brennan, the

21

formal

commitment required by statute and by regulations

22

and on

file with the Department of Education.
All of the events at issue in this case took

23
24

place in

1971 and 1972.

It was in these years that

25

Respondent had on file with the Office of Education its

grant application.

2

Respondent approved a plan submitted by the Newark Rcard

3

of Education that was not in compliance with those

4

regulations, and it was in those years that Respondent

5

spent over one million dollars providing Title I

6

services in parts of Newark that were not eligible for

7

Title I projects.
In the years since 1972, federal educational

8
9

It was in those years that

policy has undergone many changes, including specific

10

changes by both the agency and the Congress in the

11

standards for determining which areas are eligible for

12

Title I projects.
Respondents error back in

13

1971 was a

14

straightforward mathematical mistake.

15

happens, under standards subsequently enacted some,

16

although not all, of the areas that were mistakenly

17

included in the Title I projects would have become

18

eligible had subsequent standards been in effect at the

19

time.

20

Fu* as it

The question before this Court today,

21

therefore, is whether Respondent's co'n^liar.ce wi*h its

22

1971 grant agreement should be judged in accordance with

23

the standards that were in effect at the time or

24

whether, as the Court of Appeals held, it should be

25

judged according to standards enacted some six years

after the grants were awarded and the moneys were

2

expended.
QUESTION:

3

Nr. McConnell, do you think that

4

there is any inconsistency in the position of the

5

Solicitor General in this case from the position in the

6

Kentucky case?
ME. McCONNELL;

we are

No, Your Honor.

In both cases

seeking to enforce the requirements that were in
We believe in the Kentucky case

10

that there was no ambiguity, but in any event the only

11

question there was whether the interpretation of the

12

requirements might have left room for doubt.

13

no suggestion in the Kentucky case by the Court cf

14

Appeals that the standards were actually changed, that

15

there was any kind cf a retroactive application of

16

standa rds.

There is

I think it would be helpful at the outset to

17
18

clarify several questions that are not before the Court

19

in this case.

violated by Respondent is not at issue.

21

Appeals below, Respondent contended that these

22

regulations w^re inconsistent with the purpose cf Title

23

I and

24

Appeals accepted that theory, the result would have been

25

to enter a judgment that Respondent owes the Federal

2

Government no money.
The Court of Appeals did not accept that

3

argument and instead entered a judgment that was

4

inconsistent with it, namely that E escendent owes the

5

Federal Government at least $249,000. ' Respondent did

6

not take a cross-petition for certiorari from that

7

decision and accordingly is not free to argue in this

8

Court that those regulations were invalid, since that

9

would result in a judgment granting it greater relief

10
11

than it was awarded by the court below.
QUESTION;

hr. McConnell,

there were ether

12

arguments raised below in defense of the state's

13

position, were there net?

14

MR. McCONNELL i

15

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

And I suppose even if you were

16

correct that the Court of Appeals here committed error

17

in applying a subsequent Congressional interpretation,

18

the case would once again have to be remanded, would it,

19

for these ether issues?

20

MR. McCONNELL;

Well, Your Honor, I agree that

21

the case will have to be remanded, but only for these

22

issues that Respondent has preserved.

23

argument that Respondent made which would result in

24

relief which is greater than it won the first time, it

25

was required to file a cross-petition; any argument now

And for any

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

would be foreclosed.
I was going to point out another prominent

2
3

example cf that/ which is that Respondent also contended

4

in the court below that it was in substantial compliance

5

with the regulations at the time, relying upon the Sixth

6

Circuit's Kentucky decision.

7

QUESTION;

8

NR. KcCONNELL;

9

And is that open on remand?
No, Your Honor, because again,

as Respondent itself concedes in its brief, the result

10

of such a holding would be that it would be absolved

11

from all liability.

12

that.

13

inconsistent with that, and in light cf the fact that

14

there was no cross-petition that issue is now

15

f or eel osed .

The Court of Appeals did not accept

The judgment cf the Court of Appeals was

Accordingly, in the posture of the case today

16
17

this Court may assume that Respondent in fact violated

18

regulations that were valid and enforceable at the

19

time.
QUESTION;

20

Is it not true that in this case,

21

unlike the Kentucky case, the violation was that they

22

spent the money in the wrong districts?

23

doubt about they were spent for the correct purposes?
HR. KcCONNELLi

24
25

correct.

That's — well,

QUESTION:

2

And the wrong attendance areas in

3

which they did spend the money would gualify under

4

today’s standard for the sonej?
MR. McCONNELI:

5

Seme of those districts would,

6

Your Honor.

But let me point cut that in a sense the

7

problems are not that different, because the question is

8

still which children receive the benefits of Title T.

9

And Congress intended that the children in the areas

10

with the highest concentrations of poverty would receive

11

these services.

12

QUESTION:

Until 1978?

13

MS. McCGNNELL:

That’s still the standard.

14

There is now an exception for very poor districts, where

15

the levels of poverty are in excess of 25 percent, that

16

it would not be confined just to those areas that are

17

above average, but in fact those areas above 25

18

per cen t.
But the fact that Congress has made an

19
20

exception to the qeneral principle does not at all

23

funds in areas that are the neediest.

What will happen with this money if you’re

3

Will it go back to New

or will you keep it?
MR. McCONNELL:

The statute provides that the

4

Secretary may in his discretion grant tack 75 percent of

5

the recovery to New Jersey where it would be able tc

6

demonstrate that those funds could be used essentially

7

for the purposes for which they should have been used

8

the first time.

9

QUESTION:

Take an attendance area that has

10

more than 25 percent of low income families, but less

11

than the average throughout the larger area.

QUESTION:

Would they

MR. McCONNELL:

16

I do not know whether in the

17

grantback authority whether the standards today would

18

apply or whether the standards in effect at the time

19

would apply.

I think that's a very different question.

I suspect, Your Honor, but this is only my

20

speculation, that the requirement would be that the

QUESTION;

12

13

What this is is the money went to

the wrong poor people.

14

HR. HcCONNELL;

That’s correct, Your Honor.

15

And the remedy would be to require New Jersey to spend

16

-- well, either to recoup, but given the grantback

17

authority that New Jersey wculd have tc spend additional

18

money this time for the poor people for whom the

19

services were required.
Let me note that nc children are going tc b°

MS. McCONNELLs

These children

Yes, I assume that they have

graduated, but their successors in interest, shall we

say.

7

QUESTION*

Well, if they haven’t graduated

8

they won’t deserve the money.
MR. McCONNELL*

9

Presumably they are beyond our

10

reach.

Eut there are poor children in Newark today who

11

may vary well be the beneficiaries of this decision.

12

Your Honors, there are three reasons why it

13

makes sense when judging an audit recovery cf a grant

14

program to apply the standards that were in effect at

15

the time.

16

then would like to spend most of my time on the

I’ll touch upon the first two briefly and
third.

The first is that Congress has definitively

17
18

resolved this issue.

19

law that when a statute is repealed any liability

20

incurred under such a statute shall not be released cr

21

extinguished, and the statute shall remain in force for

22

the purpose of sustaining any proper action for

23

enforcing such liability.
This provision, which is now codified at 1

24
25

For over a century it has been the

U.S.C.

109, has been applied to all manners of
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

liability, including taxes, fines, criminal penalties.

2

It's been applied to amendments as well as repeals, and

3

it's applied to all liabilities incurred under the

4

statute, which this Court has held includes liabilities

5

incurred under a regulation which was authorized by the

6

sta tute .
Thus, we submit that this savings clause

7

8

applies directly to the decision in this case and that

9

it is dispositive.
Second, the 1978 Act upon which Respondent

10
11

relies was by its terms prospective only.

12

effective date which applied by its terms to its repeal

13

as well as to its new provision, and that effective date

was October

17

Moreover, the legislative history of the

18

specific change at issue here spoke in prospective

19

terms.

It referred to the manner in which school

Finally,

21

three times since 1978, in 1981 and

22

twice in 1984, Congress has considered legislation that

23

would have the effect of applying the 1978 standards to

24

the pre-1978 audits.

25

this,

Each time Congress has rejected

but most importantly, each time during the debates
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

over the provisions no member of Congress ever suggested

2

that this result might have occurred under the force of

3

the 1978 Act itself.

4

Congress both intended and understood the 1978 Act to be

5

prospective only.

Thus,

it's quite clear that

Finally and perhaps most importantly, inherent

6
7

in the nature of a arant agreement is the understanding

8

that it must be enforced in accordance with the terms in

9

effect at the time.

And this is true whether you lock

10

at it from the point of view of the grantee, whether you

11

look at it from the point of view of Congress, or of the

12

agency which is entrusted with the responsibility of

13

enforcing the grant agreement.
From the point of view of

14

the grantee,

it's

15

very important that the obligations be fixed and

16

foreseeable in advance, because this is the only way

17

grantees can act with any kind of assurance that they

13

will administer the program and net be hit with

19

liability for something unforeseeable in the future.

20

some senses, one can say that this is a principle by

21

analogy to the Pennhurst decision.

In

The Court of Appeals' holding in this case

22
23

thus is far mere likely to injure than to help most

24

grantees.

25

opinion in this case the last time it was in this Court,

As Justice White intimated in his concurring

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

New Jersey would have a legitimate complaint if it were

2

the Federal Government that was trying to enforce new

3

provisions of law instead cf the ether way around.

4

And for evidence that that was in fact the

5

shared understanding of the Federal Government and the

6

grantee, we need look no further than the conduct by

7

Respondent in this very litigation, because all of the

8

changes on which they rely were promulgated by the

9

agency in '76 and then enacted by Congress in 1978.

It

10

was not until the Respondent’s brief In this Court in

11

1983 that it first occurred to Respondent to suggest

12

that anything other than the standards in effect at the

13

time might apply to this case.

14

Respondent in its brief now castigates

15

Secretary Hufstedler for having upheld the audit

16

determination in this case,

17

Respondent puts it, the 1976 regulations and the 1978

18

regulations.

19

given the Respondent's position now, why Respondent

20

during that period cf litigation before Secretary

21

Hufstedler nev-r cited

22

certainly never suggested that they should apply to

23

judging their compliance with the 1971 grant agreement.

24
25

while ignoring, as

But it's far mere difficult to understand,

'76 regulations or the '78 Act,

This perspective is also shared by Congress,
because under Congress' spending power each Congress has

the right to determine how the federal tax dollars are

2

going to be spent.

3

divide federal funds among the various projects and

4

activities that are in the federal budget or might be,

5

but also to how those funds are to be spent.

This applies not just to how to

9

course, have the power to alter the conditions on the

Subsequent Congresses, cf

10

grants.

Subsequent Congresses can even relieve qrantees

11

of the consequences of having violated conditions that

12

had been imposed in the past.
But it makes no sense to presume that when a

13
14

Congress alters the conditions on the grants that it is

15

appropriating money for that it intends in any sense to

16

alter the conditions that a previous Congress had

17

attached to the funds that it was appropriating money

for.

But the way it was construed was not in

I'rom the very earliest days of Title I, the

legislative history shows that Congress recognized that

And X think it was a history of criticism of

11

the Secretary, of not having the flexibility.

In the

12

early reports they talk about districts with 30 to 40

13

percent levels of poverty, that the entire district

14

could be a target population for Title I programs.

15

And in Newark this was particularly true

16

because there was such a high mobility rate among the

17

districts that to say an attendance area over here with

18

33 percent wouldn’t qualify, one over here with 50

19

percent would, was almost meaningless because we had

shifting populations.
