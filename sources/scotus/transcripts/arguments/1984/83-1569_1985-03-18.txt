PROCEEDINGS
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Nr. Cross, I think you

may proceed now whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WAYNE ALAN CROSS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF MITSUBISHI
MR. CROSS;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court;
This case presents an issue involving the
tension between the unequivocal policy of the Federal

10

Arbitration Act, that all private agreements to

11

arbitrate shall be enforced except in those

12

circumstances where countervailing federal policy found

13

in another statute would create such an exception.

14

tension is between that policy and the judge-made policy

15

initiated in the Second Circuit and followed by four

16

other circuits which holds that antitrust claims may not

17

be subject to arbitration.

18

The

In Dean-Witter v. Byrd which was decided by

19

this Court two weeks ago, the Court expressed the

20

purpose of the Federal Arbitration Act in precisely the

21

terms that I think are presented today.

22

preeminent concern of Congress in passing the act was to

23

enforce private agreements into which parties had

24

entered, and that concern requires that we rigorously

25

enforce agreements to arbitrate, even if the result is

It said "The

(202) 628-9300

1

piecemeal litigation, at least absent a countervailing

2

policy manifested in another federal statute."

3

Mitsubishi in this case submits that the only

4

issue before the Court is whether a party's contractual

5

right to arbitrate antitrust disputes can be frustrated

6

absent such a countervailing federal policy found in a

7

federal statute.

8

briefs and issues raised in those briefs,

9

not what standard should a court apply on the

The issue, despite the plethora of
the issue is

10

enforcement of an arbitral award, nor is the issue the

11

extent to which an arbitral award on an antitrust claim

12

would have preclusive effect.

13

Nor is the issue whether or not antitrust

14

cases are subject to arbitration.

15

the courts agreed that under certain circumstances

16

antitrust cases can in fact be arbitrated.

17

Finally,

Now, the parties and

this Court is not today, we believe,

18

properly presented with questions of arbitrability of

19

the Puerto Rican State Franchise Act or the Dealers’

20

in Court Act.

21

of this record, those two claims have bean submitted

22

the Japanese Commercial Arbitration Association by the

23

Respondent, not withdrawn, and I believe probably a

24

decision with respect to their arbitrability on this

25

record is moot.

MR . CROSS ;

MR. CROSS:

That’s right.

The circuit court

17

specifically reviewed the question of the scope of the

18

agreement, affirmed the district court's decision that

19

the antitrust claims reasonably fell within the scope of

20

the arbitration agreement - -

MR. CROSS;

That's right, and the way the case

comes to you is, as the circuit court put it, a question

MR. CROSS*

But they squarely

Oh, no, I'm saying I believe the

only issue before you is may it be arbitrated.

We are

You just think there is no merit to

their argument.
MR. CROSS*

What I am saying is I don't think

19

there's any merit, but the circuit court and the

20

district court also didn’t think there was any merit.

21

There was a finding of fact on that.

the issue is before us, I think, under their briefs.

Accordingly, Chrysler, or in fact, a

subsidiary of Chrysler, Chrysler International,

Mitsubishi and Soler entered into what was called a

sales procedure agreement.

13

QUESTIONS

Why is that, Mr. Cross?

I am

curious?
MR. CROSS*

That was peculiar to standards --

14

they were manufactured for unleaded gas, which made them

15

virtually useless in the rest of South America which was

16

predominantly leaded gas, and they were manufactured

17

without heaters and defogges, which made them useless in

18

the continental United States, basically putting

19

Mitsubishi in a position that if they didn’t go to

20

Puerto Rico, they didn't go anywhere.

21

At the end of this, Soler terminated its

22

relationship with Mitsubishi, and it is undisputed in

23

this record that Soler said I don't want to have

24

anything else to do with you.

1

requested arbitration pursuant to the arbitration

2

agreement, and moved to compel arbitration pursuant to

3

the Federal Arbitration Act and the convention, in the

4

district court in Puerto Pico.

5

predictably by filing nine counterclaims against

6

Mitsubishi, including a federal antitrust claim, state

7

antitrust claim, a Dealer Day in Court Act claim, and a

8

Puerto Rican Franchise Act claim, so-called Act 75.

9

Soler responded somewhat

Soler also resisted arbitration.

10

The district court ordered arbitration, and

11

Soler took, an appeal.

12

petition for stay pending appeal, whereupon Soler

13

submitted all of its counterclaims to arbitration, paid

14

the arbitration fee, and the arbitration proceeded.

The Court of Appeals denied a

15

As the arbitration proceeded on all claims,

16

including the antitrust claims, the appeal proceeded.

17

The first circuit decided that all of the claims

18

submitted by Soler to arbitration should indeed proceed

19

in the arbitration, but for the federal antitrust claim,

20

whereupon Soler withdrew the federal antitrust claim,

21

and the case was remanded to the district court.

22

I think that sequence is significant because

23

what Soler did not do is withdraw either the Act 75

24

claim or the Dealer’s Day in Court Act claim at that

25

time.

12

We submit that the circuit court's

upon the American Safety case is fundamentally at odds

14

with the purpose of the Federal Arbitration Act.

15

this Court has repeatedly stated, and within the last

three terms in Moses Cone, Southland,

that the Court has to necessarily decide the question

about arbitrability of domestic contracts?

7

MR. CROSS:

In the context that this case is

8

presented to this Court, I believe you do.

9

I believe there are grounds on which you could decide

I should say

10

this without confronting that issue, but the circuit

11

court's rationale for submitting -- for reversing the

12

district court and refusing to permit arbitration was

13

that under the convention, the Convention on the

14

Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards,

15

under the convention it found an exception to the

16

mandatory nature of the convention, and that exception

17

was in the clause of Article 2 of the Convention that

18

reguires that an agreement shall be submitted to

19

arbitration unless it is a matter which is not capable

20

of settlement by arbitration.

language and took the American Safety case and said that

22

represents a policy of the United States which makes it

23

not capable for resolution by arbitration.

24
25

It seized on that

In that context, to at least reserve it in the
terms the circuit court cited,

Yes,

I do, Your Honor.

Don't

you think

that without

overruling it we really can't review it?

7

NR. CROSS:

Your Honor, I have to say as much

8

as I would like to say no,

9

could decide this case on the basis of Scherk,

you can't,

I believe you
that the

10

decision in Scherk, if applied to the antitrust laws, or

11

if applied to Pmerican Safety in the same way that

12

Scherk was applied to Wilko, if the four corners of the

square were filled in,

I believe you could decide that

And the American Safety is not,

is

it?
MR. CROSS:

No,

but I submit that if you were

to decide to do the same thing in American Safety -QUESTION:

Well,

we might just disapprove it

rather than overrule it.

24

I did not read Scherk as overruling -- as

But American Safety is not a

precedent in this Court.

6

MR. CROSS;

7

The Federal Arbitration Act, as you found in

No, it's not.

8

Dean-Witter and in Southland last term, has only two

9

exceptions from its coverage.

The first is that the

10

contract must be in commerce, and I don’t think there's

11

any question about that.

The other is that it must

Mr. Cross —
Yes.
Is it very common for

17

manufacturer-dealer agreements to contain arbitration

18

clauses?

Is that a common practice?

It is certainly -- I can’t speak

20

to the domestic context, Your Honor.

21

the international context.

22

tensions and the differing cultural backgrounds,

indicated in Scherk and Bremen, is considered to be an

important facet of international commerce.

QUESTION;

If you are correct in this case, at

2

least as far as international agreements are concerned,

3

would the dealers ever get their day in court under the

4

Dealer's Day in Court Act?

5

MR. CROSS;

Your Honor, both with respect tc

6

the Dealer's Day in Court Act and with respect to the

7

antitrust claims, it's our contention that an arbitral

8

panel is simply an alternative form.

9

understand or certainly accept the proposition that

He do not

10

federal statutory claims cannot be adjudicated by

11

arbitrators.

12

All right, I should really state it.

I think

13

that the position of the Solicitor General is that

14

either they will not be considered or cannot adequately

15

be considered, and we reject both of those contentions.

My experience and the experience of the law with

arbitration is that arbitrators will in fact take

only reason that the Arbitration Association is not now

The

2

QUESTIONS

Well, what if an arbitrator says,

3

well, I just don't think I need to consider claims under

4

the American antitrust laws; we will just ignore them?

5

Would that -- could that arbitrator -- and then decided

6

against the antitrust plaintiff, would that be subject

7

to attack in this country in the sense that could he

8

then bring a suit under the antitrust laws and not be

9

barred by that arbitrator's decision?

10

MR. CROSS:

Your Honor, my -- yes, I believe

11

so.

12

that he, notwithstanding the submission of the

13

parties -- I mean, arbitral jurisdiction is determined

14

by the submission of the parties, notwithstanding the

15

submission of both parties that the arbitrator should

16

decide the antitrust issues according to American law,

17

which is the context that we have in this case, if he

18

said, notwithstanding that submission, I refuse --

19

I believe that if the arbitrator clearly stated

QUESTION:

Or the issue -- or the issue is put

20

before them by an order of a court to one party to

21

MR. CROSS:

Well, in that -- well, as a matter

23

of fact, in this case what the district court did was to

24

dismiss the antitrust claim because of the existence of

25

the arbitration agreement.

First of all, we started the action seeking an

should be candid, we do not have an opinion of Swiss

8

under Swiss law that the United States antitrust claims

9

would not be given cognizance.

Swiss law could apply to

10

this dispute in two different ways, with respect to the

11

contract claims, the claims could be decided under Swiss

12

substantive law.

13

contracts but related to them, Swiss choice of law

provisions would probably apply, and it is not at all

clear that under Swiss choice of law provisions a tort

exemptions for labor related disputes.

there isn't an exemption for antitrust claims in the

The second -- and what I think, what I suspect,

13

is at the core of the suspicion that the American Safety

14

court and its progeny and the Solicitor General in this

case has toward arbitration of antitrust cases is really

16

a suspicion that arbitrators somehow will not be

objective or competent to handle a problem, and I submit

18

that the -- as detailed in the amicus brief of the

19

International Chamber of Commerce, the decrease of

20

sophistication that arbitrators bring to these

21

arbitrations, the complex issues that they handle on a

22

routine basis makes them perfectly capable of

arbitrating complex or simple antitrust cases.

1

Secondly, the suggestion that it is a contract

2

of adhesion is belied by the Respondent's own arguments

3

where in the context of arguing both in the lower court

4

and now in this court slightly different arguments, that

5

somehow the arbitration clause was narrowed, was not

6

broad enough — in the lower court they argued that it

7

wasn’t broad enough to encompass these particular

8

factual disputes, in this court they argue that it is

9

not broad enough to encompass statutory claims, that is

10

a peculiar argument in the context of arguing that the

11

clause was imposed by defendant seeking to avoid

12

1iability.

13

If anything,

it would have -- the broadest

14

possible clause would have been imposed.

these agreements were freely negotiated agreements, and

The final comment that I would make at this

point is that leaving aside the -- leaving aside the

the lower court solely based on Scherk.

our Scherk argument is that the securities laws simply

aren't as important as the antitrust laws, that this

Court was prepared to limit its own holding in Wilko in

limit the second Circuit's holding in American Safety to

We submit that the language of the United

The fact is the securities laws were passed in order tc

This case presents before the Court the

question as to whether a federal district court in San

5

Japan is the appropriate forum to adjudicate

controversies that appear in an action.

Counterclaims filed before the district court

MR. RODRIGUEZ-RAMON;

Over 4000,

14

the idea that Soler was selling a lot of automobiles in

Puerto Rico and creating a substantial market, increased

that quota to 4,750 automobiles, 236 percent.

that, Soler tried

in its enthusiasm to sell more car, ordered more cars

possibly than it should have ordered.

20

Despite

By the year 1981

it so happened that the

21

market in Puerto Rico was extremely soft for this type

22

of vehicle, and

23

could not pay for the cars just on the basis of relying

24

on sales in Puerto Rico because the market was very,

25

very bad for sales of automobiles in Puerto Rico during

2

Soler tried to convince Mitsubishi repeatedly,

3

and in this end, enlisted the aid of the different other

4

two dealers in Puerto Rico in order that Mitsubishi

5

would permit transshipment to the United States or to

6

South America.

7

importers of Japanese vehicles, to wit, Toyota, Nissan,

8

etc., were authorized to divert to the continental

9

United States and in fact did divert, and it so appeared

10

The theory of Soler was that the other

in the record, substantial amounts of cars.

11

Originally Mitsubishi took the position that

12

they could not agree because this was, and I quote, "an

13

issue with a tint of political complications," July

14

1981.

15

this time it was not Mitsubishi but Chrysler Motor

16

Corporation, Chrysler Corporation, that answered in a

17

telex that they could not agree because they had agreed

18

with Mitsubishi to divide markets, to allocate markets

19

and so certain dealers order on the basis of so-called

20

negotiated volumes.

21

Again Soler tried to convince Mitsubishi, and

Soler kept insisting with Mitsubishi and with

22

Chrysler, eventually received an order from Mitsubishi

23

sometime in September

24

efforty concerning the possibility of transshipment had

25

to be stopped by Soler, and reiterated that there were

1981

to the effect that every

of transshipment.

4

By then and not by its counterclaim in the

5

federal court, by then, February 1982,

Mitsubishi that this was in restraint of trade and it

was against the law.

that happened a few months before the filing of the

12

Mitsubishi filed to compel arbitration.

Soler

13

answered and counterclaimed on various grounds.

14

15

sides and decided that all the claims involved in this

16

proceeding were arbitrable and had

The

to be arbitrated

On this occasion, Soler took an appeal to the

19

United States District Court for the First Circuit.

20

that occasion, as also as it did in the lower court,

21

Soler insisted, among other particulars, that the clause

22

involved in this proceeding was narrow.

23

Court of Appeals addresses that issue specifically

24

because of the fact that it was addressed on appeal,

25

it said, and I quote, its opinion, Soler answers that it

and

1

never specifically agreed to arbitrate controversies

2

that arose under such statutes as the Sherman Act, etc.

3

So I believe that it should be very clear that

4

from the outset, we did argue that this was a narrow

5

clause, that it did not encompass the different claims

6

that we are talking about today, and that it was limited

7

to certain controversies that appeared from the clause

8

itself, to wit, controversies under paragraph 1 to 5,

9

1(b) to 5, which has controversies that have nothing to

10

do with statutory claims to this Court.

construed in such a way as to encompass particulars and

important because the arbitration, it so happened, is

It seems to be

very narrow arbitration clause, Your Honor, intendedly.

They could never imagine that two courts of the United

IN SUPPORT OF SOLER CHRYSLER-PLYMOUTH
MR. GANSFRIED:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
We believe that the Court of Appeals properly

14

accommodated the three interests that are at issue in

15

this case, and those interests are, one, the primacy of

16

antitrust law in preserving our economic system of free

17

competition; two, the general encouragement of

18

arbitration as a means of resolving private disputes;

19

and three, our commitment to an international convention

20

that requires enforcement of agreements to arbitrate

21

with very limited exceptions.

22

The convention contemplates that each nation

23

may withhold from arbitration certain limited matters of

24

special national interest.

7

this systemic structural design, antitrust claims, even

public interest in competition.

They are designed to preserve competition,
They ensure the proper

And it is this factor

10

that sets antitrust actions apart from other commercial

11

disputes.

12

I would like to refer to a statement by this

13

Court in 1930 in the Paramount Famous Lasky case in

14

which the Court said that not only the prohibitions of

15

the Sherman Act but the remedies which it provided are

16

coextensive with the broad conceptions of public

17

policy.

18

Now, among the remedies that Congress provided

19

in order to protect the public interest is the treble

20

damage action in federal court.

21

have been a vital part of Sherman Act enforcement for 95

22

years, and it is our position that parties cannot agree

23

in advance to cast aside that statutory remedy.

is an error in the application of the antitrust laws,

20

decides to apply the American antitrust laws, which is

not at all certain in this case, there is always the

possibility of error.

3

MR. GANZFRIED;

We say that when the parties

are resolving a dispute that is essentially just between

5

the two of them, they are perfectly free to do that, but

6

when it comes to the antitrust laws and what they are

7

talking about is an impact cn competition, the public

interest does require that the parties not discard that

remedy, not discard the public interest in advance on a

QUESTION;

15

Well, Congress certainly naver said

so expressly, did it?

after the antitrust act was in place, and at least it is

18

hard to find any reference by Congress to a desire to

exempt antitrust actions from arbitration.

There is no express statement

to that effect.

of

of the antitrust laws strongly indicates that it was not

25

that antitrust actions would be subject to arbitration.

47
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

There is no suggestion at any point prior to the

2

American Safety Equipment case or subsequent to it of

3

any indication that an American antitrust action had

4

been arbitrated by anyone anywhere.

5

And certainly, given the antiarbitration

6

climate that existed in 1890, we can certainly suggest

7

that Congress had no intention of supplanting the

8

enforcement scheme that it put in place with an

9

arbitration system that would not be subject to review

10

11

on a substantive legal basis by any court.
We think it is contrary to what Congress

12

intended in 1890.

13

companies that were using contracts to restrain trade,

14

and appointed private attorneys general, gave them the

15

weapon of the treble damage action to preserve the

16

public interest and to protect it.

17

directly contrary to that purpose for this court now to

18

disarm those private attorneys general and say that

19

companies could as a matter of contract disarm the

20

private treble damage action.

21

In 1890, Congress was combating

We think it would be

There is a further shortcoming with respect to
