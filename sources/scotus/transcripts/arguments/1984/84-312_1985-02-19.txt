ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
HR. LEE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

10

may it please the Court, the Combined Federal Campaign

11

is an annual effort by the federal government to solicit

12

contributions to charity from its employees.

13

Like most employers who engage in like

14

efforts, the federal government has never opened its

15

campaign to all categories of charities.

16

groups who have never participated are churches,

17

universities, opera guilds, animal welfare groups, and

18

other groups, including the respondents in this case.

19

The question pressented here is whether the

Among the

20

President has the constitutional authority to limit

21

participation in the Combined Federal Campaign to

22

agencies that provide or support direct health and

23

welfare services to individuals or their families.

24

Not included within the eligible groups are

25

organizations such as the respondents, legal advocacy

groups whose objective is to influence public policy

2

through litigation.

3

For the first

19 years of its existence, the

4

Combined Federal Campaign did not include legal advocacy

5

groups and was generally understood not to include

6

them.

7

was also consistent with the practice of other

8

employers, such as private employers, and also

9

consistent with the practices of federated charitable

The federal government's practice in this respect

10

fundraisers such as the United day and its predecessors,

11

the United Fund and the old community chests.

12

In 1980, hcw-ver, after the petitioner's

13

predecessor had determined them to be ineligible,

14

several legal advocacy groups filed suit in District

15

Court which held that the direct services requirement

16

which they had allegedly failed to meet was

17

unconstitutionally vague.

18

The President's steps taken in response to

19

that decision, culminating in Executive Order 12404,

No, there is net.

(202) 628-9300

1

Order 12404 which was issued in February, 1983, made

2

explicit that which had been the consistent

3

understanding and practice for 20 years, and I quote

4

from the language of the executive order:

5

that seek to influence the determination of public

6

policy through litigation shall not be eligible to

7

participate in the Combined Federal Campaign."

8
9

"Agencies

The issue in this case is remarkably narrow.
Everyone agrees that the respondent's right to engage in

10

fundraising activities is constitutionally protected,

11

and no one contends that every charity should be

12

constitutionally entitled to participate in the Combined

13

Federal Campaign.

14

So that the problem is one of line drawing.

15

Who is to be admitted and who is not, and by what

16

criteria does the Constitution permit that distinction

17

to be made?

18

of Appeals, by the respondents, and by the petitioner,

19

is whether drawing the line where the President has

20

drawn it, the same line that existed through five

21

previous Administrations, is reasonable.

22

The controlling issue as seen by the Court

The respondents and the Court of Appeals are

23

absolutely correct in our view in focusing on

24

reasonableness as the relevant and controlling

25

constitutional question, and we will join them orally,

as ve have in the briefs, on that issue as the issue in

2

the case.

3

But I want to do so against the background

4

that this necessarily assumes and correctly assumes that

5

we are dealing here with a non-public forum, and that

6

assumption is a correct one.

7

indeed, the only place that is at issue in this case is

8

the federal work place, which the federal government

9

most assuredly has not opened generally for expressive

10

activit y.

11
12

The only public property,

QUESTION*

Mr. Lee, does your case stand cr

fall on that proposition?

13

ft

ME. LEE*

No, it dees not, Justice Blackmun.

14

It is simply a recognition at the outset that that is

15

the correct analytical framework, but even if it did

16

not, we would contend that what the President did was

17

still constitutional.

18

But in any event,

there is general agreement

19

that the focal point for analysis in this case should be

20

whether the President's decision was feasible, that is,

21

whether there are differences between these respondents

22

and the Combined Federal Campaign eligible charities

23

which are sufficiently relevant to legitimate

24

governmental objectives that the eligibility criteria

25

are reasonable.
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

We submit that there is not only a reasonable
distiction, but that each of the three objectives stated
in the executive order constitutes a separate and
independently sufficient reasonable ground for
sustaining the criteria, and I will discuss each of them
separately.
First, while the government's exclusion of
advocacy groups is consistent with the practice of
employers generally, the government's involvement in
charitable fundraising has a dimension that is not
shared by other employers who participate in charitable
solicitation efforts, and it is this.
Governments have taken upon themselves the
obligation of caring for the needs of the poor, of
assuring that certain minimum levels of food, clothing,
shelter, and educational opportunities are available.
Segments of that obligation have been
undertaken by the federal government, ana under these
circumstances it is perfectly proper for this same
federal government to make seme reasonable judgments
concerning those organizations whose efforts are most
likely to achieve that objective and thereby to minimize
the extent to which this task must be performed by
government itself.
It will not do in this respect to point to
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

some individual instances where in the opinion of some

2

legal advocacy groups have in fact succeeded through

3

litigation in obtaining money for the poor, because in

4

the first place those efforts sometimes succeed, and

5

they sometimes yield nothing, but even mere important,

6

there is in fact a difference in the way that these

7

groups go about performing their tasks.

8
9

The eligible groups render their services
directly, and by contrast, legal advocacy groups attempt

10

to influence the action of other persons and entities,

11

including governments, and they frequently find

12

themselves opposing each other in the courts.

13

Under those circumstances, it is surely

14

reasonable, it is surely constitutionally permissible

15

for the President of the United States to make some

16

judgments concerning whether a dollar given to a direct

17

providing traditional charity is more likely in general

18

than a

19

the government’s overall burden of providing for health

20

and welfare.

MR. LEEi

completely.

for the government to conclude that its financial

efforts are better expended for groups that provide

MR. LEE:

QUESTION:

I just don't know enough.

Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask

you a question about the record?

I notice in the Court

10

of Appeals Judge Star made quite a point of the fact

11

that this was a summary judgment dase, and that

12

inferences could be drawn that were different from those

13

drawn by the majority.

14

And in your brief you don’t seem to make much

15

of the point about i being a summary judgment case.

16

What disposition do you ask for, a total reversal cr a

17

trial?

18
19

MR. LEE:
is a total reversal.

QUESTION:

21

MR. LEE:

22

Well, we think what is needed here
We think the Court has enough -You think the record is adequate?
We think it is.

Yes, Your Honor.

And that is the reason.

23

I turn next to the second objective stated in

24

the executive order, which is to minimize disruption in

25

the federal workplace, reduce the costs of fundraising,
10

and maximize the success of the campaign

In other words, the President, we submit,
could reasonably conclude that the campaign would be
less costly and would raise mere money structured as he

5

structured it, and this borne out by the record.

6

nature,

7

that was engendered by the inclusion of these advocacy

8

groups during the interim years when the lower court

9

orders have so required, the difficult barriers that

The

the tone, and the magnitude of the controversy

10

these create for those who attempted to carry out the

11

governent's fundraising objectives are summarized in cur

12

brief at Pages 37 through 40.

13

I would particularly invite the Court's

14

attention to Pages 346 through 392 of the Joint

15

Appendix, which does give a fair sample of the kinds of

16

problems that these volunteers who were charged with the

17

responsibility of running the campaign encountered

18

because of the inclusion of these particular groups.

19

Now, it is, of course, impossible to tell what

20

the performance of the campaign would have been if those

21

groups had been included, what the cost would have been

22

in terms of dollars and time, and how much money would

23

have been raised if things had been other than they

24

were.

25

But two things are very clear.

First, the

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

inclusion of these groups did pose widespread and

2

sericus problems in the judgment of those who were

3

charged with the stewardship of running the campaign,

4

and second, and probably even more important, precisely

5

because no one can make a comparison of what was with

6

what might have bean, this is the kind of decision that

7

has to be made by someone.

8

judgments, and it must be upheld so long as it is

9

reasonable.

Someone has to make those

Here it is the President who had made the

11

judgment, and it is consistent with the judgment of his

12

five predecessors/ and is clearly reasonable.

13

The respondents rely on the Hecklers veto

14

cases, and they contend that their First Amendment

15

rights cannot be suppressed by those employees who

16

disagree with them.

17

reason s.

18

Their reliance is misplaced for two

One is that none of their cases involved a

19

non-public forum.

20

was involved, the potential disruptiveness of the

21

activity in terms of disruptiveness to an ongoing

22

governmental activity has been a major factor in

23

upholding constitutionality.

24

two cases.

25

And in cases where a non-public forum

And I will mention just

One is the Perry case, in which the Court
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

found it relevant that exclusion of a rival union from

2

the school mail system would help to preserve labor

3

peace within the schools.

4

And Lehman versus City of Shaker Heights

5

recognized that exclusion of political advertising from

6

mass transit vehicles was justified in part because it

7

would avoid involving the city in controversy and

8

jeopardizing its revenues.

9

This just isn *t a Hecklers veto kind of case.

10

This brings me to my second point.

11

forum case in which the President has made some

12

judgments about the best way to enlarge employee

13

involvement in a fundraising effort while keeping down

14

the disruptive effects of that effort.

15

It is a non-public

The third reasonable basis for the President’s

16

distinction is avoiding both the reality and also the

17

appearance of using federal resources to advance a

18

particular political cause.

19

This one is squarely supported by the Court's

20

holding in Lehman versus Shaker Heights, where concerns

21

about avoiding the appearance of favoritism were held

22

sufficient to sustain a policy permitting advertising

23

generally on the city’s buses, but excluding political

24

candidate advertising.

25

I would like to invite the Court’s attention

(202) 628-9300

1

now to one feature that is common to all three of the

2

President's objectives and that I believe is dispositive

3

of the issue in this case.

4

objectives is a Presidential resolution of an issue

5

which is partially faetbeund and whose factual

6

components cannot be verified one way or the other.

7

Underlying each of these

It is not known, for example, and cannot be

8

known whether in fact health and welfare organizations

14

than to entities such as these respondents, whose

Neither can it be empirically verified whether

15

the inclusion of these groups in this campaign will or

16

will not affect such things as the ability to campaign

17

to raise money or its costs in dollars, employee time

18

and disruptiveness, or an appearance of favoritism.

19

But one thing is clear.

This Court has faced

20

that same problem in other cases and uniformly has

21

accorded governmental officials the benefit of a

22

presumption in favor of their factual judgments.

23

In Perry, for example, the school board's

24

judgment was necessarily based on a determination that

25

restricting access tc the mailboxes would, and I am

1

quoting from the opinion/ "serve to prevent the district

2

schools from becoming a battlefield for interunion

3

squabbl es . "

4

And in Lehman, in Greer, and in Jones, those

5

who were charged with specific governmental

6

responsibilities made some judgments, some factbound

7

judgments concerning the likely effect of their

8

decisions on such matters as perceptions of political

9

favoritism and the maintenance of discipline within a

10

military base or a penal institution.

11

In each institution, that judgment was

12

upheld.

13

Constitution does not prohibit a Presidential decision

14

on the ground that the factual correctness or

15

incorrectness of his determination cannot be verified.

16

Under this Court's precedents, therefore, the

I have just one final point.

We submit that

17

this just isn’t a case in which there has been a first

18

amendment violation or any sericus implication of First

19

Amendment values.

20

Federal Campaign is not the expressive opportunity that

21

it offers to charities to convince people to give money

22

to them .

23

The significance of the Combined

It offers very little opportunity for that

24

kind of appeal, and there are in any event ample other

25

available means which are far more effective for that

(202) 628-9300

1

purpose, such as direct mail, door to door solicitation,

2

commercial advertising.

3

The reason that these respondents or anyone

4

else would like to be included in the Combined Federal

5

Campaign is not because of opportunities that afford

6

expression, but rather because it is a very effective

7

money-raiser.

8

"qualitatively superior to any ether alternative means

9

of fundraising among federal workers."

It is, in the respondent's own words,

*

10

This just is net like the situation,

11

therefore, in Village of Schaumburg, where government

12

has imposed a negative on any fundraising efforts.

13

only governmental action in this case has simply been to

14

decline to confer upon a particular individual or group

15

the financial advantage of a more effective fundraising

16

opportunity.

17

The

The Court of Appeals attached controlling

18

significance to the fact that the government has already

19

determined these petitioners to be charitable because of

20

their qualification for income tax exempt status under

21

Section

22

501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
That argument, which is central to the Court

23

of Appeals decision, is highly instructive.

24

determination of what is a tax-exempt organization is

25

made for purposes quite different from those that

Mr. Chief Justice, my answer to that

is yes.

distinctions that affect only a handful of groups, 30 or

CN BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9

MR. RALSTON*

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it

10

please the Court, It is also respondent’s position that

11

the issue pressented by this case is a narrow and

12

specific one.

13

differently, however.

14

We would state that issue somewhat

And our statement of the issue is, can the

15

government prohibit charitable organizations from

16

participating in the solicitation of federal employees

17

for donations of their money because, Number One, those

18

organizations use litigation to obtain health and

19

welfare benefits for their clientele, and' Two, because

20

some federal employees find such organizations

21

controversial or objectionable on some basis or other.

22

And I think to frame that issue I would like

23

to emphasize a few key facts that are well established

24

by this record.

25

First of all, the only thing at issue in this

Because the District Court held

(General laughter.)
NR. RALSTONi

We thought we might lose, and

quite frankly, it began to become de minimis, because
when we first challenged it, 65 percent of the funds
were undesignated.

It has now shifted heavily to a

designated program, which we think is the right kind of
program .
Let me continue with some examples of some
other organizations that are in, and we are out.

I

mentioned the NAACP Special Contribution Fund, which is
a separate organization from the lead respondent here.
They do exactly the same kind of litigation that we do.
It is just apparently they do it less than

15 percent of

their budget.
Another example of the way we are excluded
even though organizations which do the same thing or get
the same results are included, we are the only category
of orgahizations excluded because we focus on a
particular cause.

American Cancer Society is in.

Various health agencies that focus on a particular issue
are in.
The regulations, and I would refer the Court
to again our appendix, Page 37A, which contains the
definitions of the agencies which are included under the

HR. RALSTON:

Your Honor, we — well, we have

11

not relied in our brief on a viewpoint argument,

12

although the government has always taken the position

13

that it wants us out because it doesn’t want federal

14

employees to read our 30 words and perhaps give us their

15

money, so in a way that is an attempt to express the

16

expression of our views, our ideas as to how their money

should be spent.

Just two matters, Mr. Chief Justice.

First, I would like to point out that Mr. Ralston had

what the President did, and that is the address of the

avoidance of controversy.

were for his actions, excluding?

4

You may —

HR. LEE;

Well, the reasons are really set

forth --

8

How do we know that?

QUESTION:

It may be that there are a lot of

reasons he might have had, but what were they?

9

HR. LEE:

The reasons are set forth in the

10

content of the executive order themselves.

11

spelled out with at least the amount of detail that were

12

spelled out, for example, in the Perry case as to what

13

the reason was for avoiding the conflict between the two

14

unions, or in the Lehman case as to what the reason was

activity --

Is that where we look for them?

judgments, but the point is that there has to be a

certain amount cf leeway for — there is no way that

anyone can determine for sure whether the President was

right or wrong in determining that the contribution to

QUESTION^

I suppose the application of those

3

criteria might lead to striking some of the other people

4

who are now on the approved list.

5

HR. LEEi

Of course, Mr. Chief Justice, and

6

that is the final point that I want to make.

7

Mr. Ralston has succeeded in doing is making a case that

8

it would be reasonable, it would not have been

9

unreasonable to have included the legal advocacy groups

10

All that

within the Campaign.

11

What he has shown is that if

there is to be a

12

campaign, the reasonableness test that has to govern has

13

to be a test that permits a fair degree of operating

14

room for the President's decision, because I submit that

15

everyone, churches, certainly universities, every

16

501(c)(3) charitable organisation can make a point that

17

the government might achieve its objectives through some

18

other way, or might make a point that they are very

19

similar to some other organization that has been

20

include d.

21

And if that is the only unprincipled,

22

unanchored rule of law that governs in this instance,

23

then there simply is no stopping it short of everyone,

24

every 501(c)(3) organization.

25

The Court of Appeals really acknowledged that
45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

there were these differences, but the Court of Appeals

2

simply held that the differences weren't good enough and

3

that maybe there was seme other way to achieve it.

4

Now, if that is the test, then it is a test

5

that is completely open-ended.

6

must be, is the President's decision reasonable, and is

7

it free of arbitrariness and caprice?

We submit that the test

8

I fail to see, for example, how it would be

9

possible if Mr. Ralston's First Amendment argument is

10

correct, how it would be possible to exclude churches,

11

because they also have First Amendment arguments that

12

would be equally applicable.

13

The respondents, in short, are very willing to

14

suggest deferential lines by which churches could be

15

expelled, by which universities could be expelled,'but

16

that there is no particular need to draw any line as to

17

them.

18

campaign can be maintained within any kind of manageable

19

bounds has to be — has to rest upon a constitutional

rule that is not only a reasonableness test, but a

considerable deference.
