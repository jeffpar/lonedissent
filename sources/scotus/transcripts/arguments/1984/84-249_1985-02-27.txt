I

1

don't think Congress intended for those rules to apply

2

in federal courts -- state courts.

3

5

QUESTION;

So the

Question

is whether Congress

intended Section 1983 to be mandatory on the state
court3 .

6

RE. FARE;

Well,

I don't think that is the

7

question.

8

rdied on the existence of jurisdiction to create an

9

implication of an obligation to exercise this.

10

In Testa v.

Katt and in ffondou this Court

It is true that under the Federal Employers'

11

Liability Act in Mondou, Congress had acknowledged that

12

state courts had concurrent jurisdiction; but in Mondou

13

this Court was careful to point out that Congress had

14

not attempted to order state courts to enforce that

15

act.

16

jurisdiction creates an obligation to exercise that.

This Court declared that the existence of

17

Even if it were important to look into

18

Congress' intent, it is very clear that until the amount

19

requirement was eliminated in federal question cases,

20

there was a large category of 1983 actions that could

21

only be brought in state courts.

22

QUESTION:

Well, you say the existence of

23

jurisliction creates an obligation to exercise it.

24

may seem collusive to you.

25

that mean?

It doesn't to me.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

That

What does

1

NR. PARE;

It means that when a court has the

2

judicial power to enforce a law and the law is

3

applicable in that coart's domain, the court must

4
5

6
7

enforce that law under the Supremacy Clause.
QUFSTION;
Congress intended,

Well, so that regardless of what
that rule applied?

NR. PARR;

If Congress intended to give the

8

federal courts exclusive jurisdiction ever a cause of

9

action , the state courts would not have the obligation

10

11

or the jurisdiction to enforce the law.
QUESTION;

Well,

but what if the intent of

12

Congress was to say federal courts have jurisdiction of

13

1983 rontreversies; state courts may take jurisdiction

14

of them if they want, but they don't have to?

15
16
17

Now, it's conceivable a Congress could have
had that intent, isn't it?
MR. PARR;

It is conceivable that Congress

18

might have had that intent, except that I don't think

19

Congress would have enacted Section 1983 and left a

20

whole class of those cases without any forum in which

21

they could be brought.

22

QUESTION;

But if Congress hid have that,

23

particular intent in mind, it would prevail over the

24

kind of assertion that the existence of jurisdiction

25

obligates one to exercise or whatever it was you said,

wouldn *t it?
MR. PARR;

I will concede that if Congress

specifically said we do not intend for state courts to
have to enforce this law, that the Supremacy Clause
would not require them to do sc.
QUESTION.:

And what if we went back, even

though Congress hadn’t expressly said it,

and came tc

8

the conclusion from reading the legislative debates that

9

that was exactly what Congress intended; wouldn't the

10
11

same conclusion be required?
MR. PARR:

I think it would require a very

12

clear showing of congressional intent, and

13

aware of any extensive debate on Section

14

Civil Rights Act which indicates that.

people would he unable to do sc without the availability

12

available to them so that they would be able to

vindicate their constitutional rights.

QUESTION;

Hr. Parr, are there any

16

circum stances in your view under which a state court

17

could refuse to entertain a Section 1983 claim?

18

MR. PARR;

It can do so when its refusal to

19

entertain the claim does not frustrate Congress'

20

policy.

21

court can apply a forum nonconvenience doctrine, or a

22

court can say I don't have jurisdiction over claims that

23

have been brought outside of the city.

QUESTION;

How about failure to exhaust state

administrative remedies?

MR. PARR;
which

That is a very subtle question

this Court has yet to address and, I would like to

point out,

need not address in this case,

and not in a

category of cases like this in South Carolina, because

5

the state court in South Carolina has said exhaustion is

6

not required in tax cases when only constitutional and

7

legal issues are involved.

8

9

QUESTION*

But --

What about a jurisdiction that does

require it.

10

MR. PARR;

In the other cases this Court would

11

have to look very carefully at the considerations that

12

led to its opinion in Patsy requiring exhaustion in

13

federal courts to see if those same considerations apply

14

in state courts.

15

I think this Court would also have to look

16

very carefully at the considerations Justice Brennan

17

noted in his concurring opinions in McNerey to see if

18

those same considerations apply to tax cases under 1933

19

in state courts.

20

And then the Court would --

QUESTION;

Well,

I suppose exhaustion could be

21

a matter of a prerequisite to state court jurisdiction,

22

depending on how it's set up in the state.

23

MR. PARR;

It could be, but If it were imposed

24

in a way to frustrate the intent of Congress, I don't

25

think

that the Supremacy Clause would allow a state to

QUESTION;

Could a state court pass an

anti-injunction act as a counterpart of the federal
anti-injunction act to preclude injunctive relief when

5

you're seeking a. tax -- when you're making a

6

constitutional tax claim in a state court?

7

KB. PARE:

I don't think a state court could

8

do that in a way that would frustrate the intent of

9

Congre ss.

10

11

QUESTION*

Well, how would you know whether it

frustrated the intent of Congress?

12

MR. PARR*

You would have to have a particular

13

case in front of you.

14

which says that the Spencers are entitled to attorney's

15

fees to encourage them to vindicate their constitutional

16

rights.

17

QUESTION:

In this case we have Section 1988

Well, suppose that in your case you

18

had sought injunctive relief from this kind of tax levy,

19

and South Carolina had a statute saying that the courts

20

do not enjoin the enforcement of the tax act.

21

to have some other remedy.

You have

You can't have an injunction.

QUESTIONS

What about a declaratory judgment?

8

KP. PARR;

Declaratory --

9

QUESTION:

Do you think that a taxpayer just

10

couldn't come in and say -- the Spencers couldn't have

11

come in and just brought an action under state law to

12

say I want a declaratory judgment that this tax

13

prevision is unconstitutional, because I don’t want them

14

to be collecting it from me any more.

15

FR. PARR:

In that case a declaratory judgment

16

would be bound by equitable principles as well if they

17

didn't also follow the refund system provided by state

18

law.

19

of equity to determine whether a declaratory judgment

20

was proper in that case.

21

And the state courts would apply normal principles

But I do not think a state statute could

22

overcide Section 1983 — Testa makes that very clear --

23

because the laws of Congress are supreme.

24
25

The Respondents say that the Tax Injunction
Act has modified Section 1983 in this case and deprived

2

However, the legislative history of the Tax Injunction

Act shows that the Respondent's argument is wrong.

Senator Bone, the proponent of the Tax
Injunction Act,

described it to Congress as a very short

bill affecting the jurisdiction of the federal district-

courts.

17

Senator Bone said that the statute would not

18

deprive any taxpayer of any equitable right or his day

Katt would hav = made their argument erroneous, because

2

it would have been clear that the state courts were

4

QUESTION:

And so the Testa against Katt would

5

have made the state -- would have made the state give

6

attorney's fees, is that it?

7

MR. PARR:

Would have made the state enforce

8

Section 1988, and therefore, there would have been a

9

remedy available in state courts.

QUESTION:

11

right in this case.

12

MR. PARR:

13

Well, that just assumes you're

And I would say likewise, if for

some reason the state courts were not obligated --

14

QUESTION:

But you wouldn't think that just

15

per se that the unavailability of attorney's fees in a

state remedy would just make that remedy inadequate for

purposes of the Tax Injunction Act?

3
4

Here, the petitioners, the taxpayers, have a
federal claim to attorney’s fees; and therefore, if the

5

stats does not make that available, I think the remedy

6

would be inadequate under the Tax Injunction Act.

7

As I repeat, as T said earlier,

there is nc

8

risk of increased injunctions in this case if the

9

Spencers prevail.

Normal equitable principles govern

10

the availability of injunctive relief in tax cases in

11

South Carolina now, and they will even if Section 1983

12

is made available.

13

taxpayers will be able to totally disrupt state tax

14

systems by using 1983 to circumvent administrative

15

remedies.

otherwise grants or that Congress has granted.

3

6

In this instance the Court on analogous cases
has found that the Supremacy Clause should not be given
the broad, expansive reading that the taxpayer does
here.

And the cases that we have cited in our brief

7

show various instances in which a state court has

8

declined to receive a federal claim, and that this Court

9

has found those actions to be proper.

10

The cases that seem to be most telling are

11

those of Douglas v. New York, Herb v.

12

Missouri ex rel Southern Railway v. Mayfield.

13

case cited in particular says that the doctrine of forum

14

nonconvenience, which is purely one that the state had

15

adopted at its convenience for the parties, is one that

16

the state may use and refuse to hear a federal cause of

17

18

We think that in

21

asked is does the state rule that is being applied , is

22

it applied neutrally, or does it single out federal

23

causes of action and prohibit the state from hearing

24

those?

25

The question that must, be

We think that the correct application of that
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

2

The neutral rule that we use is the subject matter

3

jurisiiction of our own courts.

4

Our courts have

jurisdiction over tax matters only in those instances in

5

which the taxpayer brings an action paid under protest

6

and then sues within 30 days to recover his money.

7

That is not an unusual position.

This Court

8

has recognized such an argument in the case of Testa v.

9

Katt and bondou v.

hew York.

In those particular cases

10

this Court has said that the federal claim need not be

11

heard unless its ordinary jurisdiction as prescribed by

12

local law is appropriate to the occasion.

13

Well, what is the ordinary jurisdiction in

14

South Carolina which is appropriate to the occasion?

15

Well,

we would like to point out to the Court is that in this

Title 28 United States Code 1341, more commonly known as

the anti-injunction statute, Congress recognized that

14

states had a rather elaborate and vast system of

15

handling state tax disputes.

16

under protest was the primary vehicle for returning

state taxes to the taxpayer.

MR. STEVENS:

That's correct.

But in both

instances the state already has its money.
One of the additional points that we think is
important for deciding;

did Congress require states to

10

hear 1983 actions is that of there being the requirement

11

of a clear statement when Congress wishes to intrude

12

into a fundamental state area.

13

more fundamental area than the ability of a state to

14

raise its own taxes.

15

the clear statement in 1983 that it is to be made

16

mandatory upon the state?

17

is a clear statement tc that effect in 1983.

18

I cannot conceive cf a

If that is the case, then where is

I do not believe that there

And in a similar vein, when Congress seeks to

19

waive the sovereign immunity of a state, it also must do

20

so by clear language.

21

instance, this Court in Quern v. Jordan has found that

22

1983 does not contain a clear statement necessary to

23

waive the state sovereign immunity in a federal court.

24

That decision, of course, is based on the Eleventh

25

Amendment, and it is of course recognized that the

Well, in this particular

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

1

Eleventh Amendment is not applicable in state courts.

2

But the Eleventh Amendment does contain the very germ of

3

truth

4

which is critical to this case; that is, that

states retain sovereign immunity when it is going to be

5

sued in its own court.

6

right to not be sued in its own court unless Congress

7

has clearly said you may be sued in your own courts.

8
9

The state ought to have the

Kell, the effect cf Quern v. Jordan is to say
there is not a clear statement in 1983 to waive

10

sovereign immunity because it is not there.

11

the same rule applies in the state court, that the state

12

is not to be sued unless that statement is in the

13

legislation.

14

We think

In summary, what we would like to present to

15

this Court are basically two things.

16

order for 1983 to be found to be mandatory upon the

17

states, there has to be either a constitutional source

18

for that rule, or there has to be congressional

19

authority for that rule.

20

provide that source, because that source has been

21

presented to this Court as being the Supremacy Clause.

22

The Supremacy Clause itself does not mandate that states

It is our view that 1983 in a state tax matter

that he may have.
