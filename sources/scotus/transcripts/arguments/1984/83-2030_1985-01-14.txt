as the commission of an act defined in Section

Title 21, which has been defined as the offense

of criminal sodomy.

clearly the statute may be disingenuously written.

that in his opinion below.

9

Turning to the issues,

in recognition of the

10

fact that the case is a very multi-faceted case, with

11

numerous issues, the board would like to at least turn

12

its attention briefly to several of the issues that come

13

to mind.

14

First, the board would like

to establish the

15

very multi-faceted nature of the governmental interests,

16

and not only oovernmental interests in effective public

17

education, but parental and student interests as well.

18

Second, the board will establish that the

19

balancing standard of review is the appropriate standard

20

of review in teacher speech cases,

21

multifaceted nature of the interests in effective public

22

education.

23

in

And pursuant to this analysis concerning the

24

standard of review, the board of education will further

25

establish that the concept cf viewpoint neutrality which
13

1

the Gay Task Force has attempted tc enshrine as

2

sacrosanct in every conceivable application,

3

possible hypothetical instances, is simply overextended

4

when the premise of viewpoint neutrality is extended to

5

the advocacy of a crime involved in

6

sensitive area of public school teacher speech.

7

Third, the board

the area,

the

will then proceed to describe

8

the manner in which the challenged statute contributes

9

to the achievement of the gcvernmenta1, parental,

10
11

and

student interests involved.
Fourth, the board will then proceed to

12

maintain that teacher interests in advocating the

13

specified crime of homosexual sodomy may,

14

is central to the analysis this statute, may on a case

15

by case basis be outweighed by the interests in

16

effective public education described above.

and again this

17

And finally, the board of education will

18

establish that neither the current generic fitness

19

statutes nor other so-called viewpoint neutral

20

alternatives are available to meet the sui generis

21

threat presented by the advocacy of criminal homosexual

22

sodcmy by public school teachers.

23

Turning first of all to the state interests

24

involved, the interests of

25

education would submit, in effective public education

2

I think most obvious is the interest in

3

effective and undisrupted academic education, and

4

clearly the apposite Pickering standard of review

5

contemplates this in the first three factors which the

6

Pickering court articulated.

7

Second,

I think,

and no less important is the

8

interest in developing students'

governmental activities, the political process,

attitudes toward

obligations of citizenship.

11

This Court recently reaffirmed in the Pico

12

decision that the goal includes the goal of promoting

13

respect and authority for law, which the board of

14

education would submit would be undermined by teachers

15

advocating specified crimes.

16

This aoal in fact is so important that

17

have indicated in our brief, many primary school

teachers consider the obligation to abide by school
