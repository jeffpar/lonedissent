ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. GELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Two years ago in Bell v. New Jersey, this
Court unanimously held that the federal government may

10

recoup misspent grant funds under Title I of the

11

Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.

12

cases that the Court will hear this afternoon involve

13

Court of Appeals decisions announcing erroneous rules of

14

construction that substantially frustrate the exercise

15

of this recoupment remedy.

16

The two

In this case, the Kentucky case, the Sixth

17

Circuit has held that misspent grant funds may be

18

recovered only when the violation is so plain that the

19

grantee could not reasonably have believed that its

20

expenditures were lawful.

21

basis for this ruling.

22

In our view there is no legal

Now, as the Court is aware, Congress passed

23

the Title I statute in 1965 for the purpose of expanding

24

and improving programs designed to meet the special

25

educational needs of educationally deprived children in

low income areas.

2

program has been designed to provide supplemental

3

federal educational aid to these educationally deprived

4

children over and above whatever assistance they would

5

be entitled to receive from state and local funds, and

6

in order to ensure that federal monies are used solely

7

for this purpose, the Title I program has always

8

included since 1965 the so-called supplanting

9

prohibition.

10

Now, from the outset, the Title I

Now, this provision expressly states that

11

Title I funds may be used only to supplement the level

12

of funds that would in the absence of Title I be made

13

available from state and local sources for the education

14

of children participating in the Title I program.

15

other words, Title I is designed to provide an

1S

additional layer of federal benefits for certain

17

educationally deprived children rather than to take the

18

place of any money that the state or local government

19

would otnerwise provide for educating these children.

20

The antisupplanting requirement has always been at the

21

heart of the Title I program, and it has always been an

22

express condition on the receipt of federal funds.

23

Now, this case involves the way in which

In

24

Kentucky operated its so-called readiness programs in

25

1974 under Title I.

These readiness classes were for
4

(202) 628-9300

1

children who were not prepared to enter the regular

2

first or second grade because of educational

3

difficulties.

4

I programs provided children such as these with

5

federally funded supplemental instruction in addition to

6

whatever state-funded instruction they were entitled to

7

receive.
But what Kentucky did was the following:

8
9

And in states other than Kentucky, Title

it

set up special self-contained full day classes for these

10

educationally deprived children wholly apart from the

11

regular instructional program, and it funded these

12

classes almost exclusively out of federal Title I

13

funds.

14

virtually their entire academic instruction for the

15

first and second grade through the Title I program

IS

rather than through the regular state-funded school

17

program.

18

In other words, these students received

As a result, it is quite obvious that Kentucky

19

was using federal funds to supplant state and local

20

funds that otherwise would have been available for the

21

children in these readiness classes.

22

classes unquestionably took the place of the regular

23

first and second grade classes that these students would

24

have attended in the absence of the Title I program.

25

And in fact, nearly half of the students in these

And the readiness

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

readiness classes were actually promoted to the second

2

or third grade after they had completed their year of

3

readiness training.

4

So it is quite clear that at least as to those

5

students, federal funds were being used for regular

6

rather than supplemental instruction.

7

Now, when federal auditors examined the

8

Kentucky Title I program for 1974, they concluded not

9

surprisingly that a supplanting violation had occurred.

10

Kentucky challenged this finding before the Education

11

Appeal Board.

12

Now, Kentucky conceded that virtually no state

13

and local funds had been spent for the basic

14

instructional costs of the Title I children in the

15

readiness classes, but it argued that a supplanting

16

violation nonetheless had not occurred because there had

17

been no decrease in state and local funds for the

18

schools involved.

19

Now,

this

argument

was

rejected

by

the

20

auditors, by the Education Appeal Board, and by the

21

Secretary of Education, all of whom concluded that the

22

antisupplanting provisions of the statute and

23

regulations were crystal clear in their emphasis on

24

maintaining state and local funds for the particular

25

Title I children rather than simply for particular

schools
But as I mentioned a moment ago, the Sixth

2

3

Circuit reversed the recoupment order.

The Court of

4

Appeals agreed actually with the Secretary's reading of

5

the antisupplanting provisions.

6

specifically held that the prohibition against

7

supplanting state and local funds with federal funds

8

could be read to refer to expenditures at the level of

9

the educationally deprived child rather than at the

The Sixth Circuit

10

school level, and it therefore held that the Secretary's

11

reasonable interpretation of the supplanting provisions

12

would govern all future Title I grants.
But the Court then went on to say that

13
14

Kentucky's interpretation of the supplanting prohibition

15

also was reasonable, and in these circumstances the

16

Court held that the Secretary could not recoup the

17

concededly misspent funds because the statutory and

18

regulatory provisions at issue were not sufficiently

19

clear to apprise the state of its responsibilities.

20

Now

21

QUESTION:

—

Mr. Geller, the Congress enacted

22

amendments to Title I in 1978, and some of the

23

legislative reports in connection with that observed

24

that the supplanting regulations lacked sufficient

25

clarity.
7

Did Congress itself think that they were

1

2
3

confusing,

I gather?
MR.

GELLER:

Well, Congress did not amend in

4

any way the supplanting provisions.

5

should add quickly,

of the supplanting provisions would be crystal clear to

7

every observer.

8

case there really was no two,

9

reasonable constructions of the statute,

We don't contend,

that every conceivable application

What we do contend that is that in this
there weren't one or two
and that is

10

what we are concerned with here.

But Congress didn't

11

amend the supplanting provisions,

and in fact,

QUESTION:

Well,

they —

if there were two equally

13

plausible constructions,

14

that we might treat this much like a contractual

15

arrangement and say that we are going to apply the most

16

reasonable interpretation?

17

MR. GELLER:

is it appropriate in your view

Well,

in our view,

even if there

18

were two reasonable interpretations, the question would

19

still be was the Secretary's interpretation correct?

20

other words, what is the correct interpretation of the

21

statute if in fact under that interpretation of the

22

statute the funds were misspend?

23
24
25

QUESTION:

In other words, what is the more

reasonable or most reasonable?
MR. GELLER:

Yes.

Well,

In

1

issue in this case really only arises, Justice O'Connor,

2

when there has been a determination as there was in this

3

case that the funds were in fact misspend.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. GELLER:

Right.
In that situation, our submission

6

is that the Secretary's recoupment authority is not in

7

any way limited by the fact that the state may have been

8

acting reasonably.
I hope to discuss a little bit later on,

9

after

10

lunch, why -- what the state should do when it is faced

11

with an ambiguity,

12

case,

13

favorable to it,

and it should not, as it did in this

simply adopt whatever interpretation was most
and then spend the money --

QUESTION:

14

Mr. Geller, why was the amount

15

reduced in the determination of how much had been

16

misspend?

17

MR. GELLER:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. GELLER:

20

The amount —
From some $700,000 to $300,000.
It was seven hundred -- yes,

was reduced by the Secretary of Education --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. GELLER:

Why?
-- from $700,000 to $300,000

23

because these readiness classes had a smaller

24

student-teacher ratio than in the regular classes.

25

think the ratio in the readiness classes was 13 students

to make certain representations to the state itself as

to how it would use the grant.

18

those representations was that it would abide by the

made similar representations to the federal government

in order to get the federal Title I grants.

11

this Title I service in addition to services that they

12

are ordinarily entitled to receive from state and local

that it would, and as the Education Appeal Board stated

attention —
QUESTION:

19

MR. GELLER:

Do you think

We don't think

it is

it is at all

ambiguous, but the state thought it was ambiguous, or at

least they now allege that they thought it was

ambiguous, but rather than asking for a definitive

This is the National Institute of Education,

this is at page 18 of the report which is in the clerk's

advice to grantees when they were confronted with

17

ambiguous provisions in the statute and regulations as

18

Kentucky claims it was confronted with here, and if I

19

could just read one sentence from this NIE report, the

20

report said in an effort to improve the clarify of the

21

legal framework, the Office of Education has adopted the

22

practice of providing individual interpretive responses

The mechanism was -It isn't established by regulation

or anything of that complexion.

21

MR. GELLER:

It's not established by — as far

22

a I know, by regulation, but every grantee obviously was

23

aware because there was this constant contact with

federal administrators of the opportunity to ask for a

simply to adopt one's own interpretation and to act

2

accordingly at one's peril.
QUESTION:

3

Well, Mr. Geller ,

is it true that

4

the federal auditors long before this dispute arose had

5

reviewed Kentucky's program and approved it?

6

true?
MR. GELLER:

10

Is that

That's not -- they had never

approved.
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

That is not -That is not true.

There had been

11

program teams on the premises, but they had never

12

approved the actual funding of these programs because

13

just simply by looking at the program there would be no

14

way to know how it was funded, and the supplanting

15

violation occurred not in the way the program was

16

organized but in the way it was funded.

17

Kentucky never asked for an interpretation of

18

whether the way it was funding its program violated the

19

supplanting provisions until after the year

20

here, and as soon as it asked for

21

it was immediately told by the federal officials that

22

this was a supplanting violation because all of the

23

monies of this instructional program were federal

24

monies, and as a result, state and federal authorities

25

immediately got together and worked out a program by

So if Kentucky had simply asked before 1974,
none of this would have occurred.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, does the government

7

take the position that there are no limits on recoupment

8

other than such as might be prescribed by the Congress

9

or by the Secretary's regulations?

10

MR. GELLER:

That is our legal position.

11

Obviously the Secretary as a matter of administrative

12

discretion does not seek recoupment in every

13

circumstance in which it could.

14
15

QUESTION:

But basically, whatever might be

the terms, the Secretary sets, and that's it.

16

MR. GELLER:

17

Well, Congress sets.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. GELLER:

20

Basically -- that's right.

Or the Congress, yes.
Congress sets, and Congress has

set out recoupment provisions.

Now —

QUESTION:

What if the federal agency were

23

aware of the state's particular utilization and funding

and made no objection?

Does that make any difference in your view?

found that estoppel runs against the federal government

15

generally, even in that situation.
MR. GELLER:

16

Well,

I am not sure it would be

17

an estoppel situation, Justice O'Connor, because if it

18

was an authoritative interpretation -- I mean,

19

do have to follow their own regulations.

cases that this Court has confronted, such as Community

QUESTION:

Mr. Gelier, do you think it is

5

appropriate to analogize to contract law to a degree in

6

looking at these cases of Title I grants?

7

MR. GELLER:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Well —
Don't they impose contractual type

relationships on the —
MR. GELLER:

Well, it is contractual type in

11

the sense that there is an agreement, but it is not a

12

contract, and I think it is important to understand that

13

the requirements that are imposed here are requirements

14

imposed by Congress pursuant to statutas and

15

regulations.

16

whereby A and B sit down and work out the best

17

arrangement between themselves in anticipation of what

18

is likely to occur.

19

QUESTION:

They are not contractual provisions

Here we are talking -Is it sufficiently like a contract

20

to apply against the government that old principle of

21

contract construction that ambiguities are resolved

22

against the drafter of the agreement?

23

MR. GELLER:

No, we have answered that, I

24

think, in our reply brief, Justice Brennan.

25

we are construing here not contract terms but portions

States.

Well, but don't those statutes and

regulations in effect become part of the contractual

type agreement that is entered into with the state?

10

MR. GELLER:

In the sense that the grantees

are bound by them, but that is not the question.
QUESTION:

I am not sure it would alter the

11

result, but I am trying to explore the framework within

12

which it would make sense to analyze it.

13

MR. GELLER:

There is an agreement here, and I

14

think the framework to analyze whether the agreement has

15

been violated is to recognize that this is an appeal of

16

an administrative order finding recoupment, and there is

17

a body of law as to when a court can set aside an

18

administrative order.

19

Court has to analyze the correctness of the Sixth

20

Circuit's decision in this case.

21

QUESTION:

And that is how I think this

Mr. Geller, can I just ask one

22

question about the clarity of the violation of the

23

supplanting regulation?

24
25

The Court of Appeals indicates that the local
education agency in Kentucky had to certify that there
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

would be the same number of teachers that would be paid

2

for with state and local funds as without the Title I?

3

And also I understand at least as much money went into

4

each local education agency of old funds.

5

Isn't that kind of a good prima facie

6

indication, unless you have much larger student bodies,

7

that there was no supplanting?

8

MR. GELLER:

I think not, Justice Stevens.

10

There were a number of obligations imposed on LEAs, or
s
local education agencies. One was the comparability

11

requirement which required that schools get as much

12

money from the LEA each year as they got before the

13

Title I money came into effect.

9

14

Now, we are talking here about a totally

15

different requirement which is the supplanting

16

requirement, which on its face, if the Court will look

17

at the statute and regulations, talks about the amount

18

of local money being spent on the children involved.

19

think there was some confusion on --

20

QUESTION:

I

Well, but you spend money on

21

children indirectly by hiring t^ac^ers and providing

22

classrooms, and I guess they did pay for the classrooms

23

and they paid for the same number of teachers, as I

24

understand, with local funds --

25

QUESTION:

The amount, the confusion, if there
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

was any confusion here, was that the amount of local

2

money given to the schools each year remained the same,

3

but the problem was that the Title I children were not

4

getting the benefit of any of that money.

5

instruction was being paid for by the federal money, and

6

that is where the supplanting violation occurred as the

7

Sixth Circuit ultimately agreed, there was in fact a

8

supplanting violation.
QUESTION:

9

All of their

And therefore the same amount of

10

money was being in effect used to give a better

11

education to those who were not —

12

MR. GELLER:

QUESTION:

15

To the non-title -— being the beneficiaries of Title

I.
MR. GELLER:

Exactly, non-Title I children.

16

So they were getting the benefit of all of the state

17

money rather than simply their proportionate share.

18

QUESTION:

And in deed, the regular first and

19

second grade students were getting the benefit of a

20

lower pupil-teacher class ratio as well --

21

MR. GELLER:

22

QUESTION:

23

These are non-Title I statutes.
— because the Title I children

were pulled out of their classrooms.

24

MR. GELLER:

25

QUESTION:

Exactly, exactly.
And weren't holding them back.
24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

MR. GELLER:

1

That's exactly right.

That's in

2

large part the supplanting violation here.

The money,

3

the state and local money was being used for the benefit

4

of

-- only of the non-title -- non-Title I children.
So we don't think — we think the Court of

5

6

Appeals decision is plainly wrong for two independent

7

reasons.

8

the statute and regulations, the clarity with which they

9

are written, could really conclude that there was an

10

One is I don't think that anyone looking at

ambiguity here.
QUESTION:

11

But then you are arguing -- I hate

12

to, don't mean to interrupt you -- you are arguing they

13

are wrong for two reasons:

14

under their own standard they are wrong is what you are

15

saying.

16
17
18

MR. GELLER:

one, the standard, but even

Even under their own standard,

that's correct.
QUESTION:

Because their standard is really

19

not all that -- doesn't seem all that unreasonable to

20

me, to be quite frank with you.

21

MR. GELLER:

Well, I think the stand is wrong,

22

but even under their own standard, it is hard for anyone

23

I think to look at the statute and regulations here and

24

conclude that there was an ambiguity or conclude that

25

Kentucky actually had a reasonable interpretation of
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

2

that statute and regulation.
So even by their own lights, I think the Sixth

3

Circuit was wrong.

But I think that there is a problem

4

with the Sixth Circuit's test as well because even if we

5

were to assume for the moment that the supplanting

6

statute and regulations were in fact ambiguous, and even

7

if we were to assume that Kentucky adopted a reasonable

S

interpretation of those provisions, both assumptions I

9

think are quite dubious, but even if we were to make

10

them, we still think that the Court of Appeals was wrong

11

in reversing the administrative order requiring

12

recoupment of the misspent funds and that is because I

13

think it goes without saying that there has to be some

14

violation of law before a Court of Appeals can set aside

15

an administrative order.

16

Now, as I noted a moment ago, the Court of

17

Appeals here found that in this case the Secrtary's

18

interpretation of the supplanting provisions was

19

reasonable.

20

Secretary's interpretation was arbitrary or capricious

21

or in violation of law, the Sixth Circb^t held that it

22

was reasonable and would govern all future grants, and

23

there has never been any question here that there was

24

substantial evidence.

25

In fact, far from finding that the

10
11

MR. CHENOWETH:

The details of the program as

such were not set out in that application.

12

it is very important to understand, Justice

13

Brennan, that when Congress enacted this law in 1965,

14

specifically in the law there is the intention of

15

Congress of having the programs that were going to

16

benefit these educationally deprived children developed

17

by the states.

18

The design was going to be left for the states to come

19

up with on the belief that the way Kentucky dealt with

20

this problem would be different than the way it would be

21

dealt with in another state.

22

They were intended to be innovative.

So there was no a requirement or an

23

expectation that in the receiving of those Title I funds

exactly the nature of the program.

that we -- what

we need to zero in on is not really the interpretations

QUESTION:

3

Is that an estoppel argument of

some kind?

4

MR. CHENOWETH:

Your Honor, we do not believe

5

that it is an estoppel matter any more than the

6

Solicitor General's office has indicated it to be.

7

think that there are significant differences between

8

this case and the Crawford Community Services case, the

9

Heckler case.

We

One, that was not a spending power case,

10

it was a private party that was receiving these funds,

and there was certainly a very questionable

interpretation upon the law that was involved in that

case .

14

So we don't see that what' we are having to

15

focus in on in this Title I case as being an estoppel

18

case or a Heckler case at all.

17

Again, we believe that the pertinent question

18

that has to be addressed is what were the understandings

19

of the commitments under that Title I contract, the

contract that is in place because Title I is a spending

21

power clause provision of the federal constitution, and

it is very much in the nature of a contract.

2

that program had been developed, that there was a

believe that the Sixth Circuit did look at a coalition

of factors in looking at this request to apply the

Secretary's interpretation of what was prohibited by

supplanting, and one of those factors is Kentucky's good

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Chenoweth, I suppose that
43

(202) 624-9300

1

the program itself, operationally, in the sense of

2

providing smaller classroom settings for children within

3

an appropriate project area, children who qualified for

4

the aid, is something that the federal government would

5

want to examine in any event, and did, and the question

6

of whether the state had reduced its level of support

7

for those children is a different question, is it not?

8
9
10
11

MR. CHENOWETH:

Yes, we believe that is a

different question, but also is a part of the
consideration of the design of that program.
Kentucky as well as other states were

12

attempting to create innovative ways to meet the needs

13

of these educationally deprived children.

14

QUESTION:

Well, certainly the federal

15

government could have picked up its alleged problem

16

earlier than it did, but do you think that that alone

17

means that no recovery can be had?

18

MR. CHENOWETH:

Not alone, Your Honor, but we

19

do believe importantly in looking at the way the Sixth

20

Circuit in reviewing this issue which we believe is the

21

pertinent issue, and that is what the understanding of

22

the commitments- were by Kentucky in the receipt of those

23

Title I funds, that that was a factor, that Kentucky had

24

had the operational people in looking at the design, and

25

they had not been told that there was anything wrong
44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

with those programs, and we believe that was a part of

2

the good faith of the Commonwealth concerning these

3

self-contained readiness programs.

4

QUESTION:

Well, good faith is not normally a

5

defense either to the application of an appropriate

6

federal statute or regulation of this type or, if you

7

treated it as a contract, to a defense under a contract

8

theory, is it?
MR. CHENOWETH:

9

As a pure contract theory, no,

10

we would agree with that, Justice O'Connor.

But again,

11

we are looking at a contract here in the nature of a

12

grant in aid program, in the nature of the cooperative

13

federalism where the state is giving up something,

14

giving up rights that it has in order to enter into that

15

cooperation with the federal government.

16

that in order to do that -- and we did think consistent

17

with Pennhurst, and that Pennhurst is very much

18

applicable in this case, as the Sixth Circuit Court of

19

Appeals believed, that if there is going to be that

20

giving up, then there is going to have to be a clear

21

understanding of what it is that thle!; state is giving

22

up.

We believe

23

To that extent, we do believe that the Court's

24

consideration that there had not been any finding of bad

25

faith is very much a part of the standard of review that
45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

the Courts of Appeals are to exercise pursuant to this

16

money going to those school districts, we had the same

18

We were not saving any

So that the only incentive that possibly could

19

have been available to the state,

20

districts, had to be a belief that those programs were

22

programs and the receipt of that federal money.

23

QUESTION:

You are not now arguing that the

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

supplanting, are you?
MR. CHENOWETH:

2

Your Honor, we are not saying

3

that any of these matters as a sole factor show the

4

point.

5

QUESTION:

For example, if they shifted all

6

the money they -- all their first and second grade

7

teachers into the higher grades and reduced the ratios

8

in the higher grades and then financed first and second

9

grade entirely with federal money, you would say that

10
11

would be a clear violation?
MR. CHENOWETH:

Your Honor, I think that that

12

is obviously a different situation, and yes, that would

13

be supplanting

14

But here we were not doing that.

The benefit

15

that was derived from having these self-contained

16

readiness programs was a matter that was agreed and

17

conceded in the administrative proceedings.

18

matter that was made reference to by the Sixth Circuit

19

Court of Appeals, to the fact that when the auditors

20

made the exception, they made the exception only for the

21

children that were going to be promoted and not for

22

those children that were going to be held back.

23

It was a'

We believe that that tends to indicate that

24

there were differing levels of understanding even by the

25

auditors and the education appeals board as to what was
47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

meant by supplanting, and that it was not just our

2

perhaps reading of the law, but it was also the reading

3

of the law by others.

4

That ambiguity that we do believe existed both

5

facially and application, can be seen in the fact that,

6

one, it is in the NIE report that there was a lack of

7

clarity in the issue of supplanting.

8

the unclearness of the understanding as to what was

9

supplanting, existed even after 1977, or 1974.

This ambiguity,

It went

10

on even through 1977, and that again is in the NIE

11

report that that had been very much an issue in the

12

Office of Education between various members of that

13

office.
So we have a continuation even past the period

14
15

of our audit when there was still some problems as to

16

what was meant by supplanting.
The

17

supplanting

statute

certainly

stated

a

18

goal, but we argue that it did not explain how that goal

19

was going to be achieved and was going to be gained, and

20

we do believe that when you look at the language and

21

look at the manner in which that is applied, look at the

22

different kind of indicators that are going to have an

23

important play upon what is meant by supplanting, again,

24

whether

25

the pupil, whether you look at that in the pupil and
48

you

look

at

that

as

the

Secretary

would

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

like,

at

1

also the classroom, the school district, those

2

indicators, are you going to look at it simply money, or

3

are you going to look at it benefit?

4

The Secretary must have looked at it not only

5

in terms of money; he had to have looked at it in the

6

sense of benefit, a benefit supplement because he

7

reduced it merely on the fact that we had the lower

8

student-teacher ratio.

9

approach to it at all, but still gave us a modification

10
11
12

13

That didn't change the dollars

of the amount of money on the basis of the benefit.
So two levels are existent, even through the
proceedings of this case over six or seven years.
The third factor that the Sixth Circuit Court

14

of Appeals looked at in applying the proper legal

15

standards, again as it was supposed to do, and looking

16

at this case in the sense of Pennhurst, and looking at

17

it in the sense of the significant issue that was

18

identified in Justice White's concurring opinion in Bell

19

v. New Jersey, and that is whether the state should be

20

held liable in a recoupment action, in a postaudit

21

recoupment action if there was merely a technical

22

violation or if there was a different construction of

23

the statute after the state had had their plan submitted

24

and approved —

2

things was not in compliance with the law.

3

that change in construction or the notification of the

construction of the law on supplanting is a factor and

5

is a part of what the Sixth Circuit was obliged to do in

the reviewing of this recoupment consideration in Title

7

I.

8

9

We think

Certainly the retroactive, postaudit
recoupment of Title I funds as desired by the Secretary

10

would be inconsistent with the consensual nature of a

11

grant program, like Title I is, where a state ought

12

to — it really has to be able to weigh what the

13

benefits and the burdens are.

14

The Secretary's desire to have his

interpretations applied retroactively is not in keeping,

we believe, not only with the Pennhurst decision, but is

17

not in keeping with the Rosatc v. Wyman approach.

So unless something in the

10

Title I statute prevents the Secretary from recouping

11

money that has been misspent, we don't think that there

12

can be any overturning of that recoupment decision.

13

And as I read earlier,

the Title I recoupment

14

provisions contain nothing suggesting that there is a

15

requirement of showing bad faith or showing that the

16

grantee did not act reasonably or any of the other

17

things that Kentucky is arguing for today.

18

QUESTION:

So you would say the normal rule

19

should be followed that if the Secretary's

interpretation of the statute is a reasonable one, we

should accept it.
