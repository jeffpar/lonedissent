MS. POTASH:

Honor, because I

4

believe that this Court, if it adopts the fact that the

appellate court must first characterize the nature of

the action, and then refer to the state statute of

limitations, it might affect the outcome of this case.

ME. POTASH:

I believe,

Your Honor, that we

could have different rules in each forum,

that the first consideration that the federal court

would have to make is to determine what is the analogous

9

In the case, if I recall correctly,

that

10

follows me, the state supreme court did characterize the

11

action one way, and the federal court was attempting to

12

characterize it another way.

13

and perhaps this is not directly in answer to your

14

question, that uniformity is a

requirement.

As far as uniformity as far as the country is

concerned, or uniformity as far as the state is

HR. POTASH.:

Specifically with respect to

22

cases involving discrimination in the hiring or

23

promotion of public employees, each day of delay in

24

commencing suit further establishes a person who was

25

hired

or promoted in the place of a complainant in his

Thus in the event that the public employee’s

5

conduct is ultimately found to be discriminatory,

6

government service may be substantially disturbed.

7

That again. Your Honor,

I may point out, is a

8

legitimate reason for the distinction between the

9

statute of limitations

which may apply to a public

10

official and to a private employer.

11

to commence the process of undoing that which was the

Yes, Your Honor, but that

2

eventuality that there may be a finding that the action
