ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARL LUNA, ESQ.,

I think you may proceed.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
NR. LUNAs

Nr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, this case involves the

10

constitutionality of a zoning ordinance of the City of

11

Cleburne, Texas, on its face and as applied, and it

12

involves a property owner who wishes to contract with

13

the State of Texas to operate an intermediate care

14

facility for 13 mildly and moderately mentally retarded

15

adults who do not --

How large is the city?

MR. LUNAs

20,000.

Federal legislation

21

authorizes the funding and therefore the different

treatment of this group of mentally retarded men and

23

women from other persons.

24

that the facility must be located in an incorporated

25

city which is subject to special use permits, local

zoning, and/or occupancy requirements, and must be

The City of Cleburne met these requirements.

To operate such a facility then in Cleburne in

Kay I inquire?

I don’t quite

understand what you just referred to.

position that the State of Texas requires the city to

9

use special use permits for homes for retarded people?

10

MR. LUNA;

Absolutely.

Is it your

The state regulation

11

will not permit the location of a factility in a city

12

unless that city has the special use permit requirements

13

or local zoning laws.

14

QUESTION:

I had understood the position of

15

the State of Texas in its brief to be that the city was

16

not authorized as a matter of state law to base its

17

zoning decisions on the physical adequacy of the site cr

18

of a given structure as a group home.

19

20
21

Do you agree with the position taken by the
State of Texas here?
MR. .LUNAi

Absolutely not, and the state

22

regulation is in evidence, and the state statute in

23

Texas provides that even if there was a conflict, that

24

the statute that provides for the zoning regulations

would prevail over the other, but the State of Texas is

QUESTION;

Thank you.

14

KR. LUNA;

Now, as I mentioned, the city met

11

argument.

15

these requirements that the state had, and therefore it

16

was necessary to apply for a special use permit and have

17

a public hearing.

18

it was developed that the home would have 13 mentally

19

retarded men and women and two staff employees in this

20

facility.

At the public hearing and in court,

2

The building's location on a lot

103 feet wide

3

and 156 feet deep, directly across the street from a

4

junior high, with considerable school traffic, and in a

5

500-year flood plain, was of real concern to the members

6

of the City Council, because just the year before

7

Buffalo Creek had reached the steps of 201

8

Street.

Featherston

9

And Bobbie Northrop, one of the corporate

10

officers of C1C, likewise recognized this potential

11

flood problem for the residents of this facility when

12

She stated before the Planning Commission and it is in

13

evidence as Exhibit 20, Plaintiff's Exhibit 20, we would

14

evacuate the residents and not let the situation get out

15

of hand so that an evacuation would not be possible.

16

QUESTION*

Mr. Luna?

17

MR. LUNA*

Yes, sir.

18

QUESTION:

When you say it was in a 500-year

19

flood plane, does that mean that you would expect a

20

flood every 500 years?

21

22
23
24
25

MR. LUNA:

Every 500 years, but we don't know

whether it is next month or when, of course.
QUESTION*

And did the city have a general

policy against building within that flood plane?
MR. LUNA*

It did not have a general policy

QUESTIONS

While T have you interrupted, how

do you define mental retardation?

9

MR. LUNAs

Well, mental retardation is defined

10

— I would accept the American Association of -- the

11

definition as defined by American Association on Mental

12

Deficiency, and Dr. Roos, the expert in this case, said

13

that it is subaverage general intelligence functioning,

14

existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive

behavior.

This Court dismissed the appeal of a state

court case involving a zoning ordinance with a

classification that was based on mental retardation

which were reviewed under the rational basis standard.

The three members of the City Council that we

are talking about voted to deny the permit.

who sc voted was a grandfather who had a deceased

but there is another side of the ordinance that requires

off-street parking and other things which would make it

questionable that you could locate that many people in

this property.

code requirements that would make it very questionable,

ordinances show for a boarding house, for example, but I

don't believe there is a chance in the world* that

people, 13 people and two staff members could wind up

using this place as a boarding house or anything else.

Now, the home at that time, located across the
street from the junior high that we had

mentioned, met

2

has new, however, since this case has come to light,

3

reduced the number of people to be put in one of these

homes in Texas from 13 to six, thereby, we think,

recognizing the good judgment of the Cleburne City

Council in saying that this was too many in this

particular house.

QUESTIONi

10

May I go back for just a moment,

11

Mr. Luna, please, to the statement about the number of

12

people and other uses?

13

the potential residents of the home were not mentally

14

retarded, but the home was the same in all other

15

respects, its use would be permitted under the zoning

ordinance.

MR. LUNA:

The District Court found that if

agree with that finding.

4

So you are attacking that finding

of fact?

5

6

I am net sure I would completely

I will tell you that, as to whether that is —

9

MR. LUNAi

Well, clearly 13 people in a family

10

could live there, so certainly to that extent there is

11

no question that the finding is correct, but the record

12

simply — you will note that the record did not develop

13

and part of the ordinance is in evidence here on fire

14

walls and that sort of thing, so it was not developed as

15

to what would be the requirements.
QUESTIONS

16

Mr. Luna, we have a finding of fact

17

in the record, and I am trying to decide whether we

18

accept it as a correct finding or part of your case

19

involves setting aside that finding.

20

position?

21

MR. LURAs

Which is your

Well, I believe that in this case,

22

since a mentally retarded home in this case requires

23

more than room and board, it requires training,

24

habilitaton training under both the federal statute and

25

state regulations, that even if that finding is not set
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

aside, it would not be the same thing in case for a

2

mentally retarded home, because they are different.
And as Stigner versus Texas said, we are not

3
4

required under the law to treat different things, things

5

that are different as if they were the same.

6

that there is a different need for mentally retarded.
QUESTION:

7

We believe

Well, didn't the Court of Appeals

8

judge the case on the basis that the reason for the

9

refusal of the permit was that this was a group of

10

mentally retarded people?

So we have two courts

i

11

agreeing that it was the nature of the occupants that

12

made the difference, both the District Court and the

13

Court of Appeals.

14

NR. LUNA:

The nature of the occupants —

15

QUESTION:

We rarely disturb those kinds of

16

findings, do we?
MR. LUNA:

17

I think it is a little different

18

from that, though.. These occupants -- if we are talking

19

about, for example, a boarding house, all we would need

20

is rocm and board.

21

house .

22

Here, this is more than a boarding

QUESTION:

That is true, but the reason it is

23

more than a boarding house is that they are mentally

24

retarded people.

25

Isn't that right?

MR. LUNA:

No, sir.

It might have been used

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

for a boarding house, but the reason under this case.

2

the reason it would be -- what it is going to be used

3

for is to attempt to give habilitation treatment to 13

4

mentally retarded people, none of whom have the skills

5

of independent living.

6

QUESTIONS

Right.

7

MR. LUNAs

So there is more going on —

8

QUESTIONS

I think your answer to my question

9
10
11

would be yes, because this group is different because
they are mentally retarded.
MR. LUNAs

Exactly.

So that is why I say, if

12

those findings -- they are different because they are

13

mentally retarded.

14

QUESTIONS

Well, is one of the factors that in

15

an emergency such'as a fire they might not respond the

16

same as a family under the supervision of a mother and a

17

father over children, or they might not be able to cope

18

the way 13 or 14 boarders could cope?

19

MR. LUNAs

Exactly, in a flood.

I would hate

20

to be here defending the City Council if they located

21

there and a 500-year flood came the next month and we

22

got some people drowned.

23
24
25

QUESTIONS

Mr. Luna, in your petition for

,certiorari, you presented two questions.

One is whether

mentally retarded persons are a quasi-suspect class for
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

purposes of equal protection analysis.

The second is

2

whether for equal protection analysis legislation

3

affecting mentally retarded people must be tested by an

4

intermediate or heightened level of scrutiny.
So, I would presume that you intend to argue

5

6

some time not just as to whether you should win this

7

particular case under the Constitution, but what

8

standard it should be judged by.
MR. LUNAi

9
10

Right.

That's what I'm coming to

right now.

11

The District Court found there was a rational

12

basis for these decisions, and the District Court based

13

its holding that the mentally retarded persons are not a

14

suspect or a quasi-suspect class requiring heightened

15

judicial scrutiny for the Fourteen Amendment equal

16

protection analysis on the reasoning of the Third

17

Circuit case of Doe versus Colautte.

18

Now, the Fifth Circuit, of course, reversed,

19

holding that mentally retarded people are a

20

quasi-suspect class.

21

decision, the Fifth Circuit created yet another

22

constitutionally protected class consisting of all

23

mentally retarded persons in the United States, and we

24

believe contrary to this Court's decision in Youngberg

25

versus Romeo.

Now, in order to reach its

16

(202) 628-9300

1

This group is not the discrete insular

2

minority envisioned by this Court in U.S. versus

3

Carolene Products, but it is rather a large, diverse,

4

and amorphous class proscribed by this Court in San

5

Antonio versus Rodriguez.

definition of it earlier.

ability to learn, difficulty with abstract thinking,

judgment, problem-solving, and retention, and includes

problems of social adjustment and economic productivity.

17

the subgroups.

Both the manifestations of retardation and the

19

level of care required by each group vary to extremes

20

ranging from requiring full-time institutionalization tc

21

those who are not even discernible on casual contact,

22

which, incidentally, constitutes the overwhelming

23

majority of mentally retarded persons, yet the Fifth

24

Circuit has lumped them all together in one class, the

25

mentally retarded.

By definitiori/ the needs and capacities of the

Unlike other suspect or

This relationship between the stereotyped

MR. HICKS;

Well, the people that would be

don’t think, there is a basis.

believe that it is quite likely that in the event of an

Wouldn’t you think that they are

entitled to make a distinction between the ability of

5

that environment precisely because someone has

6

determined medically or psychologically that they are

7

not capable of coping as normal people are, as capable?

8
9

MR. HICKS;

Well, that, I think, overstates

the determina'tion that is made.

10

QUESTION;

11

MR. HICKS;

Well,

then, why are they there?

They are there in many instances

12

because they do learn slower, is the shorthand version

13

of what mental retardation is, and they need an

14

opportunity in a structured environment to do their
l

15

learning, to learn, for instance, household cleaning

16

chores and the importance of following through on those

17

things, cooking skills.

18

This is, as the name implies, an intermediate

19

facility, and most people it is hoped will move on to

20

even mere independent living in these situations.

21

believe that it overstates the disability of mental

22

retardation to say that they are unable to cope with

23

everything in daily living, and

learn how to better cope in some instances with certain

details of daily living.

(202) 628-9300

1

I think that the city's actions in this

2

particular case and its justifications for its actions

3

are a crystallization for the Court of the historical

4

attitudes and mistreatment and underestimation^of

5

mentally retarded people and their abilities.

6

The city has offered two general

7

justifications for the distinction drawn in the zoning

8

ordinance.

9

in essence to protect society from the mentally retarded

One is that it is to protect the neighbors,

10

people.

The other is that it is to protect retarded

11

people themselves.

12

This is a classic example of government's

13

historical justifications for exclusion of mentally

14

retarded people from many areas of .American life.

15

the one hand, it is argued we are here to protect

16

society.

17

On

We exclude them to protect society.
Then, as an afterthought, the argument is

18

made, well, it is really also intended to protect the

19

mentally retarded people.

20
21

22

It is to do them some good.

I don't think the record in this case supports
either one of those justifications.
QUESTION i

As to protecting --

I notice that the first argument

you make in your brief is that there was no rational

It just seemed to me that in the

Turning to the question of whether

of mentally retarded people perhaps more than any other

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

criteria that this Court has established for what

2

constitutes a class that calls for heightened scrutiny

3

when discriminations are made against it.

4
5

QUESTION:

Incidentally, you have not ever

urged strict scrutiny, have you?

6

MR. HICKS:

Your Honor, we did urge strict

7

scrutiny before the Fifth Circuit.

8

Again, I think that the standards that this Court has

9

set,

10
11

They rejected it.

if applied here, would mean that strict scrutiny is

appropriate.
But once again, trying to narrow the decision

12

as much as is necessary, I think a heightened scrutiny

13

at what has been termed the quasi-suspect level of

14

scrutiny would be appropriate and would result in the

15

invalidation of the city’s actions in this instance.

16

Mentally retarded people are a quintessential,

17

discrete, and insular minority.

They have suffered from a history of mistreatment that

is virtually unequaled in this nation’s history except

litigation that has come before this Court that

delineates the problems in these large institutions that

I

And I think it is true that there is a

6

substantial relation between any discriminations, if you

7

want to call it that, drawn in, say, the Special

8

Education Act, that there is a substantial relationship

9

between that and an important governmental interest of

10

providing an appropriate education program for mentally

11

retarded people.
I think that there are many fewer laws that

12
13

discriminate on the basis of mental retardation than

14

might at first blush appear.

15

that guardianship laws, sterilization laws, commitment

clearly do not.

So, I think it is overstating matters to think

that a whole host of statutes would be subject to

Furthermore --

Perhaps not invalidation, but at

least heightened scrutiny.
MR. HICKS;

10

Again, I think there is a much

11

smaller universe of statutes that fit that, and my next

12

point was going to be that invalidation does not

13

necessarily follow from applying heightened scrutiny.

14

This Court has, in other instances where heightened

15

scrutiny has been applied, upheld classifications based

16

on gender, based on illegitimacy.

17

And it has shown itself capable of discerning

18

when important interests are at stake and when there is

19

a substantial relationship between the objective and the

20

classification drawn in the statute.
QUESTION;

21

Are there other groups that in your

22

view likewise merit heightened scrutiny which haven’t

23

been given it in the past, such as the mentally ill or

24

people who are homosexuals or other particularized

25

groups?

I think. Your Honors, that if what Cleburne

has dene in this case in excluding mentally retarded

there is virtually no limit set by the Constitution on

2

MR. LUNA:

But I think the Fifth Circuit was

3

talking about in cases generally, and this Court has

4

generally held that the rights,

5

involved in a suspect or quasi-suspect class is when the

6

condition has no relation to the person's productivity

7

or their contribution to society.

that the question

/

8
9

Now, in that way,

the mental retardation is,

of course, completely different.

It is different from

10

blacks and women and the legitimate question where the

11

suspect provisions have no relation to their

12

productivity or their contribution to society.

13

In this case, the mentally retarded persons

14

must be in many instances treated very differently, and

15

some, cf course, to the extremes, have to be placed in

16

institutions, and they said in this case while they can

17

come and go, at the'same time the records show in this

18

case that they sometimes would also have the authority

19

to restrain them.

20

Now, Texas has a statute which affirmatively

21

protects the rights of mentally retarded . _ We have an

22

entire set of statutes on rights of mentally retarded

23

and protecting those rights.
