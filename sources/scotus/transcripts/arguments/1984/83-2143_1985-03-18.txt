ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. GRUNOW, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Harvey

MR. GRUNOW;

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;

11

This criminal case is here on a writ of

12

certiorari to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals

13

whch reversed Defendant Street's first degree murder

14

conviction and sentence of life imprisonment and

15

remanded the case for a new trial.

16

The question before this Court is whether a

17

nontestifying accomplice's confession can be

18

constitutionally used on rebuttal to impeach the

19

defendant's claim that his own confession was a coerced

20

imitation of the accomplice 's.

21

22
23

The facts relevant to this inquiry are as
follows;
This prosecution arises out of the 1981 murder

24

of a 72 year old man who was found hanged outside his

25

burglarized home in a small mountain community in east

3

defendant Street's case was severed from the others.

4

The defendant#

a Clifford Peele# and five

The state's proof in chief at Street's trial

5

consisted of several confessions by the defendant and

6

testimony of law enforcement officers concerning the

7

scene of the crime that tended to corroborate certain

8

details of the defendant's confession.

9

From the time of its opening argument through

10

its case in chief# the state did not mention the

11

existence of Peele's confession.

12

defendant presented an alibi defense and took the

13

stand.

14

that Feele had given a confession which had implicated

15

the defendant in the murder.

16

admitted that he gave a confession but maintained it was

17

merely a coerced imitation of Peele's earlier

18

confession.

19

Thereafter, the

In his direct testimony the defendant admitted

The defendant also

With regard to this claim, the defendant

20

maintained that prior to taking his confession# the

21

sheriff repeatedly read him Peele's confession.

22

defendant also claimed that when taking his confession,

23

the sheriff interrupted him any time his account varied

24

from Peele's and demanded that the defendant replicate

25

Peele's version, which the defendant then did.

As part of its rebuttal proof, the state for

the first time in this case sought to introduce Peele's

confession into evidence.

allowed to introduce the confession for the limited,

non-hearsay purpose of establishing that it was said,

10

occasions, and the record clearly indicates that the

11

state carefully limited its use of and argument on the

12

accomplice's confession to the impeachment purpose for

14

Thereafter, the defendant was confict.ed of

15

first degree murder and was given the only sentence

16

permitted in this case under state law, life

17

imprisonment.

18

Criminal Appeals reversed the conviction of the

19

defendant on the ground that the introduction of Peele's

confession under the circumstances of this case denied

the defendant his confrontation rights under the Sixth

answered in the negative in this case

2

As to the first basic question, the manner of

introduction created little if any likelihood of

improper consideration.

5

where no legitimate inferences against the defendant

6

could he drawn from the evidence placed before the jury,

7

in this case there was a legitimate inference that could

be drawn from the introduction of Peele's statement,

namely, that Peele's confession was sufficiently

We believe, Your Honor, that the

QUESTION:

7

MR. GRUNOW:

No,

Your Honor.

Then the Court was wrong.
Yes, Your Honor.
Factually.
It was wrong assuming those facts

8

and interpreting them the way they did as a matter of

9

federal constitutional law.

10

QUESTION:

Do you agree with this statement,

11

that in this case, while admission of the confession was

12

not technically used to prove its truth, the state

13

actually placed before the jury testimony incriminating

14

the defendant made by one not available for cross

15

examination.

16

Do you agree with that statement?

17

MR. GRUNOW:

18

It is our position that because of the limited

No, Your Honor.

19

nature of the statement's introduction in this case, it

20

was not offered to prove the truth of that statement but

21

was rather merely entered to show what that statement

22

was, to directly impeach on rebuttal the defendant's

23

claim that he parroted the very terms of that other

24

confession.

25

We believe that the Court of Criminal Appeals

below misapplied this Court's doctrines as enunciated in

2

Bruton and Douglas and the Parker plurality to find that

3

there necessarily had to be a substantial likelihood cf

4

improper consideration.

5

simply did not occur in this case.

6
7

QUESTIONj

It is our position that that

How did the subject of a confession

first come into the record of the case?

8

MR. GRUNOW;

9

QUESTION;

As to Peele's confession?
How did the subject of a confession

10

first get into the record and called to the attention cf

11

the jury?

12

MR. GPUNOW;

Your Honor, the subject first

13

came in in the defense attorney's opening remarks to the

14

jury in which he pointed out that a co-defendant, Peele,

15

had confessed and had implicated Street in the murder.

16

In this case, as to the substantial likelihood

17

of improper consideration, the defendant focused the

18

jury's attention on the existence of the accomplice's

19

confession.

20

the jury had already been informed by the defendant that

21

the accomplice had confessed and had implicated him in

22

the murder, thereby avoiding the potential for any

23

proper consideration of the confession as introduced

24

later by the state.

25

We submit that this is important because

As to the second basic question raised by this

(202) 628-9300

1

court in prior decisions, bcth as a policy and practical

2

matter, any resulting risk of unfair prejudice

3

occasioned by the introduction of such limited purpose

4

evidence on rebuttal was eliminated through the use of

5

limiting instructions.

6

three factors in determining whether the introduction of

7

such evidence would further rather than impede the

8

search for truth, first, whether adequate justification

9

exists for the use of the questioned evidence; second,

In Bruton, this Court considered

10

whether alternatives exist in the pursuit of truth to

11

avoid any conflict; and third, whether the devastating

12

nature of the evidence is too great as a practical

13

matter to be cured by a limiting instruction.

14
15

QUESTION;

May I ask a factual question to be

sure I have this right?

16

Is it correct that the defendant at the trial

17

did not challenge the fact that this -- that he said the

18

words that were said to be his confession?

19

his position was he said them under coercion and sc

20

forth?

21

MR. GRUNOW;

22

QUESTION;

23

Rather, only

That is correct.
But the actual text was not --

there is no real dispute about that.

24

MR. GRUNOW;

25

QUESTION;

That is correct.
Okay.

I wanted to be sure.

1

MF. GBUNOW

As to the first factor, there

2

were legitimate and compelling reasons justifying the

3

state's use of such evidence in this case.

4

and Parker, this court dealt with judicial economy in a

5

joint trial as a justification for the use.

6

more important justification lies in the defendant's

7

election to place before the jury his parroting claim

8

which called into question the very terms of his

9

accomplice's confession.

10

In Bruton

Here, the

Now, as a practical matter, the state was

11

justified in using the accomplice's confession because

12

it was the strongest and only adequate evidence to

13

directly challenge that defendant's claim.

14

matter, after making his parroting claim, the defendant

15

should not be allowed to invoke the confrontation clause

16

tc bar the limited non-hearsay rebuttal use of such

17

evidence.

18

would impede the ability of the jury to assess the

19

credibility of the defendant's claim, thereby posing a

20

grave risk of perversion of the truth-seeking function

21

of the trial.

22

the confrontation clause as a shield to subvert the very

23

mission of that clause as ensuring the fairness and

24

accuracy of the criminal claim.

25

As a policy

Such invokation of the confrontation clause

It would also permit the defendant to use

Such a policy is consistent with past

decisions of this Court.

2

States, this Court recognized that evidence which may be

3

too prejudicial to introduce in the state's proof in

chief, even with limiting instructions, may nevertheless

5

be used for impeachment purposes once the defendant

elects to put that issue into evidence by taking the

stand.

Where, as in this case, it is offered

QUESTION:

Oh, yes, assuming it is relevant,

are there any limitations by virtue of the prejudicial
nature of the evidence?
NR. GRUNQK;

It is quite possible that the

12

prejudicial impact in certain occasions may outweigh its

13

probative value, and we simply say that this is not that

14

type of case, and we do not want this Court to give a

15

broad ruling to that effect.

16

relevant and these other factors weigh so heavily in its

17

favor for admission, we suggest that there are

18

compelling reasons to admit it.

19

But when in fact it is

As to the redaction issue, we suggest that is

20

the third factor in this case -- the second factor in

21

this case, that no effective alternatives existed.

22

Redaction or limited use simply would not have permitted

23

the state to adequately use the confession to challenge

24

tha parroting --

2

MR. GRUNOWj

They did. Your Honor, but they

3

did not offer any suggestion as to how it might be

redacted?

5

QUESTION:

But they did hold, did they not,

that there might have been redaction without destroying

7

the state’s impeachment use, didn't they?

QUESTION;

10

MR. GRUNOW;

They did hold that.
And you disagree with that.
I disagree with that, Your Honor

11

In this case, in the peculiar facts of this case, the

12

defendant did not take the stand and simply say that

MR. GRUNOWf

The reason for that, Your Honor,

is that his testimony would have only gone to the

MR. GRUNOW;

The Court of Criminal Appeals --

13

that the Court of Criminal Appeals would have come out

16

HR. GRUNOW*

I believe they would in the

17

sense, Your Honor, that the question was whether the

18

defendant was in fact subject to cross examination on

19

the stand.

20

Everyone seems to agree that he was in the jail next

21

door, and that made no difference whether he was

22

actually in the courtroom or over in the jail, the fact

23

that he was not taking the stand seemed to be the

24

turning point in this case.

25

Availability was really not an issue.

alternative way of handling the problem?
As I understand it, the point w as that

3

Peewle's confession did not have some facts in. it that

4

the defendant's confession did have, and you wanted to

5

show therefore the defendant's could not have been

6

parroted, and after reading the confession, as I

7

understand the record, the officer was asked were these

8

acxts in the confession which you just read, and he

9

denied as to each of those facts.

10

Why couldn't he have been asked those

11

questions without reading the confession, and then had

12

the confession in the courtroom in order to verify

whether or not the testimony was true?

14

Why was it necessary to read

and not just identify those points?
MB. GRUNOW;

One of the reasons why the state

17

found it important to do more was that it was not only

18

the emissions in Peele's statement that made the

19

parroting claim incredible; there were numerous

20

differences, only slight differences between similar

21

events that both narrated that would show that it was

22

impossible for them to have merely been the result cf a

23

parroting claim.

5

MR. GRUNOW;

Yes, Your Honor, that it was for

So your point is there is a little

difference in the style and the language and so forth?

6
7

That's correct.

QUESTION;

Well, but why wouldn't the

impeachment have been adequate just with the omission

10

point?

11

because you had independent evidence I think at the

12

scene that coincided with what the defendant had said

13

and

14

that I don't know why you had to -- it seems to me that

15

is by far the more persuasive impeachment of the two.

16

It seems to me that is the most persuasive,

what had been omitted from Peele's confession, so

MR. GRUNOW:

It may he the more persuasive,

17

Your Honor, but we are here arguing whether the

18

defendant’s confrontation rights were violated, and we

19

believe that because of weighing the factors that I

20

mentioned initially, those factors tipped the scale in

21

favor of the state's introduction of the complete

statement in this case.

CN BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER
MR. SCHWARTZ;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court;
In view of the United States, the decision of

10

the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals represents a

11

misapplication of the doctrine of this Court's decision

12

in Bruton v. United States.

13

respondent, this Court's decision in Bruton does not

14

hold that the recaption in evidence for any purpose of

15

the inculpatory statement of a nontestifying accomplice

16

necessarily violates the confrontation clause, nor does

17

it hold that instructions that limit the use of such a

18

statement are in all cases ineffective.

19

Contrary to the argument of

Rather, as we understand it, the Court held

20

that in light of the inadmissibility of the hearsay

21

statement incriminating Bruton in that case, the

22

critical weight added to the prosecution's case by the

23

declarant statement there and the general availability

24

of separate trials as a device to avoid the problem that

25

existed in Bruton,

there was no sufficient justification
20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

for running the risk that the limiting instruction given

2

in Bruton would prove an insufficisnt bulwark against

3

the risk of unfair prejudice that would result if the

4

instruction were disregarded.

5

This case differs from Bruton in numerous

6

critical respects which we believe call for a different

7

conclusion hera 3nd require that the judgment of the

8

Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals be reversed.

9

Bruton emphasizes the inadmissibility under

10

the traditional rules of evidence as against the

11

Defendant Bruton of the declarant's out of court

12

statement.

13

statement was admissible against respondent for a proper

14

purpose, and there doesn't really seem to be any debate

15

that the state had a legitimate objective here and it

16

was one that we deem compelling.

17

course, was to enable the jury to assess the

18

respondent's claim that his own statement was a coerced

19

imitation of the declarant's, and we agree with the

20

state's argument that the very best evidence available

21

to the jury to assess that claim was to look at the

22

statement itself.

23

Here, of course, the declarant Peele*s

That purpose, of

This is partly. Justice Stevens, because of

24

the fact that -- I think it would naturally occur to a

25

juror that the best way is to look at the two statements

side by side to see what all the nuances are, and while

2

it may have been sufficient, I might well -- we as

3

jurors might well have been persuaded by the omissions

4

factor, a juror in assessing this claim I think would

5

want to see the whole thing, and I think it was an

6

important kind

7

of evidence.

QUESTION;

But isn't the argument also

8

available that the burden really was on the defendant to

9

prove his parroting claim?

I mean, he's the one who

10

brought it up, and I would suppose if there were merit

11

to it, he would have been the one to put the confession

12

in .

13

HR. SCHWARTZ;

Well, th is case has a peculiar

19

the most appropriate way to prove his claim by

20

attempting to get the statement b efore the court.

demonstrating this.

MR. SCHWARTZ;

All right.
On the question which was the

only question material to the state's purpose in putting

11

the statement before the jury on rebuttal, whether the

12

declarant had actually made the statement, the purpose

13

and requirements of the confrontation clause were

satisfied, Sheriff Papantoniou, through whose testimony

the statement was put before the jury initially, was

16

available for cross examination.

18

is no, in those circumstances, there is no confrontation

clause problem, and we believe that that conclusion is

20

supported not only by the opinion for ths plurality of

21

Justice Stewart, but also by Justice Harlan's concurring

opinion, and therefore was endorsed by a majority of the

23

whether it is billed cross examination or direct

21

examination, a person who is physically available, as

22

Peele certainly was -- his location was known to all.

have been called as a defense witness and there is no

questions from the prosecutor, they would highlight the

differences between the two confessions without reading

5

That is, in response tc the

In pursuit of this agreement, the Court

6

instructed the sheriff to read the confession to

approached the bench and then requested permission to

The Court reminded

him of the original agreement, but the prosecutor

non-hearsay.

4

QUESTION;

Counsel, I am really a little

5

the state to call the declarant when the statement of

the truth of the contents of the statement.

9
10

MR. ROGERS;
QUESTION;

Well, it is our position -That's such a basic rule of

11

evidence, it is hard for me to understand how the

12

confrontation clause comes in at all.

13

MR. ROGERS;

Well, we think that the heart cf

14

the Bruton decision is that a jury is simply unable to

15

disregard the dramatic impact of an accomplice's

16

confession, particularly --

17

QUESTION;

Well, that might invoke a due

18

process concern, but it is very hard for me to s ee

19

it raises a confrontation issue.

20

MR . ROGERS;

Well , I think it was labeled a

21

confrontation issue in Brut cn because Evans was not

22

available for cross examination regarding that

23

statement, and I think we can say the same thing about

24

Clifford Peele.

25

QUESTION;

But he was available certainly to

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

the defense if they had chosen to call him, wasnt* ht?

2

MR. ROGERS;

If we could have called him and

3

gotten him -- and labeled him a hostile witness, we

4

still would have been faced with the situation where the

5

state had already accomplished what they had wanted to

6

accomplish and gotten the confession before the jury

7

because as I see it, the confrontation clause has two

8

prongs.

9

declarant to make the accusation under oath in a

10

It is cross examination and requiring the

judicial forum.

11

Well, the first prong had already been removed

12

because Peele had already made the statement through

13

Sheriff Papantoniou ’s mouth.

14

QUESTION;

Yes, but as I understand it, the

15

trial judge’s theory of admitting that was that it was

16

independently admissible of the truth to rebut your

17

client's contention that his confession was just kind of

18

a parrot job on Peele’s confession.
MR. ROGERS;

19

Fight, because it was not being

20

offered for the truth of the matter asserted, a

21

hearsay --

22

QUESTION;

And there you don’t have -- if it's

23

a legitimate hearsay exception to the confrontation

24

clause, you don’t have those two requirements, I don’t

25

think.
34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. ROGERS;

I still think that under Bruton,

2

labeling it hearsay -- I don’t think there’s any

3

distinction between telling the jury don’t use this

4

confession against this defendant, use it against that

5

defendant, and don't use this confession for the truth

6

of the matter asserted, but do use it against the

7

def endant.

8

10

I think the jury is very quickly able to
pierce through to the important part of the confession,
and that is the aocusatory part.

11

QUESTION;

Well, was there any independent

12

grounds for admissibility in Bruton such as there was

13

here?

14

MR. ROGERS;

Not against Bruton himself, no,

15

there wasn't, but I don’t believe that that’s the

16

critical -- I dont think that’s critical to the decision

17

in Bruton.

18

QUFSTION;

Well, isn't this much like or

19

analogous to the situation in the Harris case where it

20

was held that you could properly admit for impeachment

21

purposes statements that were inadmissible under

22

Miranda, not for the truth cf those statements but for

23

impeachment, and isn’t this the same thing?

24
25

KR. ROGERS;
Justice O’Connor.

No, I don't believe it is,

In Harris and Hass and that line of

1

cases, the sword/shield cases, we engage in a balancing

2

test, balancing the reason for the admission against the

3

reason for the exclusion.

4

evidence that was reliable and trustworthy was excluded

5

and the truth was frustrated in order to deter police

6

misconduct, in order to get them to comply with Miranda,

7

but there was nothing wrong with the statements

8

themselves.

9

In those cases we exclude --

They were not involuntary or coerced.

So the balancing test favored using the

10

evidence to enhance the truth finding function of the

11

trial.

12

In this case, though, Peele's statement was

13

excluded precisely because it did constitute a threat to

14

truth determination either under a hearsay analysis or

15

confrontation analysis.

16

confession of an accomplice is inevitably suspect, and I

17

think that makes the distinction between this case and

18

the svord/shield cases.

It is our position that to the jury, that the

that the two statements were not identical, but rather,

The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals concluded, after

MR. ROGERS:

I think that there they could

look to either the federal or state constitution on the

balancing and competing interests precisely because of
