MR. RYAN;

13

this case comes here on a petition by

It is our position that that court was in

14

error when it held

settled sovereign immunity doctrine under the precedence

of this Court it could not have reached the conclusions

4

that it did.

5

those settled principles and precedents be applied

6

today.

We ask nothing more in this case than that

7

The guarantee of sovereign immunity, simply

8

stated, is this, that no state may be sued in federal

9

court without consent given.

In the final analysis,

10

when one reviews the decisions of this

11

Eleventh Amendment area, it is the search for consent

12

that marks the Court's decisions.

13

Court in the

As with any guarantee or privilege under the

14

Constitution, this Court has stated repeatedly that a

15

waiver will not be found absent the clearest of

16

circumstances.

17

In the context, of the Eleventh Amendment, it

18

has been the rule since at least 1908 in the Murray

19

versus Wilson Distilling Company case that a waiver of

20

sovereign immunity will not be found absent express

21

language or overwhelming implication from the text as

22

will leave no reasonable construction otherwise.

23

This clear statement or clear language rule,

24

bred no controversy, nor even invited the attention cf

25

this Court until there began to emerge the concept that

7

This clear statement requirement also obtains

8

even where Congress is exercising its plenary powers

9

under the Fourteenth Amendment.

10

While consent to abrogation under those

11

circumstances is presumed by virtue of the state’s

12

ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment,

13

this Court has still required that the language which is

14

to be deemed sufficient for abrogation be explicit.

Congress has not evidenced in any clear language any

5

The Ninth Circuit found that Congress had

which literally included states.

8

it is clear that there is no inclusion of the states

under the Act expressly.

To start with,

The plain reading of the

10

statutory language in this case demonstrates that

11

Congress has made no expression on the requisite intent

12

that this Court has required.

13

When it came to expressing that states would

14

be excluded as recipients under the Act, Congress left

15

that to the executive branch, which did so by

regulation.

20

Certainly if Congress has not provided for an

21

express remedy under the Act, it cannot be claimed that

22

it has swept away state's immunity to federal suits

23

under the very same language.

Two or three circuits

24

have reached this conclusion.

government has concurred in its amicus brief filed in

MR. RYAN*

24

QUESTION:

You didn't mention that.

QUESTION;

Mr. Ryan, would the plaintiff here

1

have been able to file suit in the California state

2

courts under Section 50*4 for damages?

3

MR. RYAN :

Very definitely.

4

QUESTION:

Is that because the state has

5

generally waived its sovereign immunity to actions like

6

this in the state court?

7

MR. RYAN:

The state has generally waived its

8

immunity for suit in states under this type statute,

9

not

-- that is not to say, of course,

that the state has

10

waived its immunity under the Eleventh Amendment for

11

suits in federal court.

12

QUESTION:

So your position is the Eleventh

13

Amendment protection is really broader than the

14

protection under the sovereign immunity doctrine.

15

MR. RYAN;

but

Our position is that under

16

established law as handed down by this Court, that

17

waivers under state law pertaining to suits brought in

18

state courts do not constitute a waiver of the Eleventh

19

Amendment immunity from suit in federal court.

20

QUESTION:

Have we ever so held?

21

MR. RYAN:

Yes, you have -- yes,

22

has, Your Honor, in several cases.

QUESTION:

Where that particular point was at

Where similar statutes --

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

QUESTION:

I mean where you had an

2

acknowledgement by the state that there had been a

3

waiver of any sovereign immunity defense, nevertheless

4

assertion of the Eleventh Amendment.

5

MR. RYAN:

Well,

the position of the

6

defendants in this case is not that there has been a

7

broad waiver of sovereign immunity, only that there has

8

been a waiver in state courts, and this Court has seen

9

this very same argurnet made in a number of cases right

10
11

through Pennhurst II.
In fact, the statute that was raised in

12

Pennhurst II and reviewed by this Court was almost

13

identical to the constitutional provision which

14

respondent relies on in this case, and in Pennhurst II

15

and in Patsy and Employees, this Court rejected the same

16

argument on each occasion.

17

QUESTION;

Your provision says, "Suits may be

18

brought against a state in such manner and in such

19

courts as shall be directed by law."

20

include federal courts, the way you read it?

21

MR. RYAN:

That's correct.

That does not

It does not

22

include actions in federal court.

23

has never been so held, and in fact, in the only case

24

which I am aware of that has reviewed that

25

constitutional provision, it is a District Court case,

And, I might add, it

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

but it did uphold the very argument that I am making

2

tod a y.

3

In any event, when respondent has conducted

4

his presumably thorough review of the legislative

5

histories and materials underlying both this Act and

6

Title 6, we find that only two intents may be gleaned

7

from that review;

8

understanding of Congress that states would be generally

9

covered by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973;

first, that it was the intent or

and second,

10

that Congress anticipated or expected that some form of

11

redress would be available to persons who were victims

12

of violations of Section 504, whether that form of

13

enforcement would be through administrative remedy or

14

private action.

15

Neither of these understandings on Congress’s

16

part, however, serves to answer the essential inquiry,

17

and the very reason why respondent embarked on his

18

review of the legislative history, neither of these

19

understandings show an intent by Congress or an

20

expression by Congress that it had considered and firmly

21

decided to sweep away the immunity of the states,

22

notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment.

23

We have seen more than one statement of this

24

clear statement rule, and we submit that it is the test

25

which must be applied in this case.

For instance, in

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

1

the Employees case,

4

of lifting their immunity from suit in federal court.”

5

the clear statement rul° was framed

"Congress must by clear language

In Quern, it was stated by this Court that

6

"Congress must by clear language indicate on its face an

7

intent to sweep away the immunity of the states,” and

8

most recently in Pennhurst II this Court restated the

9

rule and embraced it in the following terms:

"Congress

10

must by unequivocal expression of intent express that

11

intent to overturn

12

several states."

13

14

respondent has gone to supply this Court with the

Title 7 is just one example of how that kind

2

of abrogation can be done and will satisfy the

3

precedents of this Court.

Fespcndent and amici, however, have suggested

5

that this clear language or clear statement rule be

abolished.

7

and

practical considerations underlying such a rule.

8

9

Such a suggestion ignores the strong policy

First off, the clear language or clear
statement rule provides notice, notice to all involved,

10

notice to the states that the sovereign immunity is

11

being attempted to be abrogated, notice to the

12

beneficiaries, if there be any, of an act as to what

13

their available remedies are, and not least importantly,

14

notice to this Court that an abrogation has in fact been

15

attempted.

16

The alternative for not having a clear

17

statement rule leaves this Court in the position of

18

having to deduce from inference as to what Congress's

19

intent was with respect to state sovereign immunity.

20

This is a role which amici have suggested

21

should not perform.

22

this Court

At the same time, the lack of a clear

23

statement rule requires by nature that states become

24

surveyors of the Congressional Record and scattered bits

25

of legislative history both under the subject Act and of

For the first time in this case respondent has

We have addressed those items in our reply

What the state is trying to do in this case is do an end

run around the clear will of Congress by interposing the

4

We believe there are three reasons for

5

upholding the decision of the court below.

6

first reason, when Congress drafted and enacted 50 4, it

intended to create a federal civil right, enforceable in

federal court against any and all recipients, including

the states.

16

18

that, under both federal and state law, California has

consented to suit.

20

Beyond

That consent follows from receipt of federal

1

I would like to respond to Mr. Hyan's

2

contention that before a state may be brought to federal

3

court by a citizen to vindicate a federally created

4

right, the statute creating that federal civil right

5

must contain magic words under the state proposed

6

express language rule.

7

Se contend that that is an extreme rule, and

8

it confers on the Eleventh Amendent protections given to

9

no other rule.

Such a rule would direct this Court --

10

would direct courts to reach results which would be

11

contrary to the will and intent of Congress, reach

12

results which would frustrate the very purposes for

13

which a statute was enacted, would direct this -- would

14

direct courts to ignore legislative history.

15

And the reason we are in this situation is

16

really the failed logic of Hans.

17

Then to limit Hans you have the notion, the fiction

18

developed in Ex Parte Young.

abrogation,

20

Then you need more, so

waiver, and consent doctrines are developed.

Indeed, with the complexity of these

21

doctrines, you have a situation which is confusing,

22

Byzantine in structure, and one in which actually this

23

Court would aive license to a state who is in federal

But beyond the facts in our individual case,

A

has never been held to be sufficient to constitute a

completely contrary to the express waiver requirements.

Respondent mentioned that the rule that should

limits of implied waiver cases.
And in fact under almost virtually the same

12

facts this Court in the Employees versus Missouri case

13

came to just the contrary conclusion, wherein it was not

locked into prior precedents in which it had held that

states were included within all-inclusive language
