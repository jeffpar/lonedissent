yourself

The reason why the detention was extended in

this case was quite clearly because Officer Thrasher

didn't know -- he was acting as agent for Cooke in

making the stop.

could I ask at this

Sharpe as it is with respect to Mr.

FREY;

Well,

Savage?

I would say that as to

respondent Sharpe,

Except that he was by the side cf

the road with an officer telling him he couldn't gc any

ME. FREY;

Well, it is possible,

contend it is not true, that Sharpe was unlawfully

That they might be connected.

2

MR. FREY:

Because Sharpe and Savage were

3

clearly together.

4

One is whether Sharpe was unlawfully detained, and my

5

point in this connection is that what you must focus on,

because what is at issue is the admissibility of the

Now, for fr. Sharpe, he was detained longer,

QUESTIONS

Dc you rely on those two

4

cir cum stances merely as buttressing your showing of

5

probable smuggling activity, or do you rely on them in

6

part as violations of law?
MR. FREY;

7

Well, with respect to the speeding,

8

I rely on it only insofar as an issue which is net

9

before the Court, which is the validity of the initial

10

step,

which the Court of Appeals didn't pass on.

11

think

the initial stop would be justified by the

12

speeding. I do not rely on the extended detention cn the

13

basis of the speeding,

Leaving aside the question cf

respondents' fugitivity, I would say that it would be

6

within the discretion of this Ccurt either to go ahead

and
decide it if it chose to or to remand it.
✓

8

For instance, in United States against

Hasting, where the issue was harmless error, there was a

Now, in addition, because the respondents are

consider the effect that that has on the proper
