I think the fundamental point to grasp here in

terms of the delay is that Eastern answered this

complaint approximately six weeks after it was filed.

At that time we said that the Warsaw Convention and the

Montreal Agreement limit our liability.

QUESTION:

Mr. Sharp, may I just ask on the

MR. SHARP:

the fact that

It doesn't say date of judgment

Are there cases that refer to that date?

NR. SHARP:

We have no indication, in either

14

But is there any indication that

It conceives of a claim that is

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

it’s the limit on liability.

2

And this convention then provides the means

3

for determining the liability in a judicial proceeding.

4

So it’s reading a number of provisions together, plus

5

the specific language in the second sentence that speaks

6

of awards or awarding damages,

7

that the critical point for determining the value of the

8

limit is the time of judgment.

9

Now,

that leads me to believe

what we conclude from the text of the

10

Warsaw Convention is that it -- first of all,

11

all elements.

12

covers all elements of the Plaintiff’s recovery against

13

the carrier.

14

Stevens, the limit

That is, the limitation on liability

And second, as I mentioned to Justice
fixes the carrier’s maximum liability

16

Now, the lower court in its ruling that

17

pre-judgment interest can be awarded over and above the

18

limitation of liability is inconsistent with this

19

reading of the Warsaw Convention that I have tried to

20

give to the Court.

21

I want to turn new to the text of the Montreal

22

Agreement.

23

confirms the fact that pre-judgment interest cannot ba

I want to make with respect

to the text of the Montreal Agreement is by way o*

Warsaw's limit -- the limit contained in the Montreal

MR. SHARP;

My opponent argues that what the

11

Montreal Agreement has done is effectively created a

12

liquidation of damages provision, and it's liquidated

13

damages in the amount of 375,000 that are due at the

14

time of the accident.

15

I think there's a practical answer to that.

16

I've tried now to give you the textual reading as tc why

17

that is not so.

would have agreed to that provision because this
