Residents in exactly

Let me tell you how the tax system works.

4

Nominally, everyone, every individual who first

5

registers a car in Vermont is required to pay a 4

6

percent tax.

7

in other states are granted a credit for taxes paid to

8

the other state.

9

circumstances are denied that credit.

10

However, residents of Vermont who buy cars

Nonresidents in exactly the same

In effect, this means that a Vermont resident

11

who gees to Illinois and buys a car, pays an Illinois

12

tax of 7 percent, comes back to Vermont and registers

13

the car there, pays no tax to the State of Vermont.

14

An Illinois resident in exactly the same

15

situation goes to exactly the same dealership on exactly

16

the same day, pays the tax, buys the car, pays the tax

17

of 7 percent, moves to Vermont. When that person

18

registers his car in Vermont, he pays a 4 percent tax to

19

the State of Vermont.

20

QUESTION;

Hr. Williams, I was going to

21

inquire whether it isn't the case that Illinois and New

22

York laws exempt Vermont residents from payment of the

23

sales tax if they leave Vermont and buy the vehicle in

24

Illinois or New York?

25

MR. WILLIAMS;

No, they don't.

If a Vermont

resident bought a car in Illinois and stayed for only

2

two or three weeks or bought a car in New York and

3

stayed for only two or three weeks, in that case they

4

would have an option.

5

Illinois or New York,

6

They would not have to pay

But let's take the case of, for example, an

7

executive who is transferred to Illinois for three

8

months; buys a in Illinois for his stay there.

got to pay the Illinois tax in order to drive that car

11

He has

in Illinois for three months.
Other situations might be retirees who went to

12

Florida and stayed over the winter.

13

pay a tax to Florida.

14

they would get a credit for the tax paid.

They would have to

When they got back to Vermont,

15

So I don't think it's true of — if you stay

16

for only two or three weeks, you have a choice.

17

than that, you have to pay to the other state.

18

QUESTION*

Other

You say the proper basis for

19

comparison here is not the Vermont resident who stays

20

for two or three weeks in New York or Illinois, but the

21

one who stays for the longer — three, three month or

22

longer period?

23

MB. WILLIAMS;

Well, th4 person who stays

24

longer than two or three weeks, just like the Appellants

25

stayed longer than two or three weeks after they bought

their cars in Illinois and New York.
QUESTION;

But are there any — does the

record show there are any such Vermont residents?
ME. WILLIAMS;

There’s no record in this case

because it comes up on a motion to dismiss.
QUESTION;

What if the facts were that there

7

were no Vermont residents who ever stayed more than

8

three months in Illinois and also bought a car there?

9

mean more than three weeks.

10

Do we know there are many

people in that category?

11

MR. WILLIAMS;

12

because it’s a motion to dismiss.

13

matter of judicial notice, it is undoubtedly clear that

14

there are people who go to California, college students

15

who go to California for a year, or people that are —

16

business executives that are transferred for three

17

months, a year, two years; retirees that go to Florida;

18

people that go on a long vacation.

19

I think we have to assume it,
I think that as a

There’s any number of situations that one can

20

imagine where a Vermonter would buy a car in a distant

21

state and not register in Vermont, but register in the

22

other state.

23
24
25

QUESTION;

Mr. Williams, you’re the Illinois

one, rather than the New York one in this case?
MR. WILLIAMS;

That’s correct.

QUESTION:

Could it be said that your real

argument is not with Vermont, but with Illinois?-

3

HE. WILLIAMS:

4

QUESTIONS

I don't think it could —

Which, after all, doesn’t grant you

5

a refund even though you're out there just a short

6

time.

7

suppose, that you didn't use their roads for 12 months

8

and

And you could make an argument with Illinois,

I

so ought to get a refund.

9

Isn't that your problem, rather than Vermont?

10

MR. WILLIAMS:

I have no problem with

11

Illinois.

12

have no problem under the equal protection clause or

13

under the privileges and immunities clause with Vermont

14

if Vermont charged me a 4 percent tax that it also

15

charged to all its residents.

16

I think Illinois treated me fairly.

I would

My problem is with Vermont under the equal

17

protection clause and the privileges and immunities

18

clause because residents of Vermont don't pay Vermont

19

anything, but I pay Vermont 4 percent.

20

everyone that moves to Vermont.

21

22

23

QUESTION;

And so does

What do you mean when.you say

residents of Vermont don't pay Vermont anything?
ME. WILLIAMS:

A resident who purchases a car

24

in another state and pays a tax to another state, like

25

me, pays Vermont nothing because that resident gets the
7

(202) 628-9300

1

credit for the taxes paid in the other state which I dc

2

not get.

3

I'd also add that in 1980, until 1980, I would

4

have been treated the same as a Vermont resident.

5

in that year, the Vermont legislature repealed the

6

exemption that would have applied to me, evidently in an

7

effort to raise, some funds.

8
9

There's no legislative history on the repeal
at all, but that's what happened.

10
11

But

So I believe that the discrimination
violates —

12

QUESTION!

Mr. Williams, let me try to clarify

13

this thing in my own mind a little bit further.

14

Vermont resident obtained -- bought a vehicle out of the

15

State of Vermont and registered'the vehicle in another

16

state for the vehicle's first registration, is there a

17

credit then if the Vermont resident later brings the

18

vehicle into Vermont and registers it?

19

MR. WILLIAMS;

If a

The statute says -- the statute

20

plainly says that any Vermont resident who purchases a

21

car in another state and pays a tax in another state.is

22

entitled to a credit.

23

yes.

24

interpreted the statute, the Vermont Superior Court has

25

interpreted the statute.

So I think the answer to that is

That's the way the Vermont Supreme Court has

There is no suggestion
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

anywhere that that isn’t the case

2

I think, any time a Vermont resident pays a tax

3

to another state he gets a credit, which isn’t true when

4

a nonresident does the same thing.

5

I think the tax violates the equal protection

6

clause because it infringes the right to travel.

7

sets up a barrier for people coming to Vermont.

8

happens to be a tax on a car; it could be a tax on any

9

other property.

10

It
It

The point is that it's a tax imposed on

11

nonresidents that isn't imposed on residents in the same

12

circumstances.

13

QUESTION*

Actually, the discrimination you

14

complain of occurs after you’re a resident of Vermont.

15

And so it's really a discrimination between two

16

residents of Vermont.

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

HR. WILLIAMS;

Well,

that's certainly one way

to —
QUESTION*

Well,

that’s your basis for your

equal protection argument.
MR. WILLIAMS*

Right. That is the basis for my

equal protection.
QUESTION*

But there’s no rational basis for

differentiating between these two kinds of residents.
MR. WILLIAMS*

Right.

I would only point out

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that it is true that I was a resident at the time.

2

There’s no requirement that I had to be a resident to

3

register a car.

4

without being a resident.

5

6

Anybody can register a car in Vermont

So that is the basis of my equal protection
claim; correct.

7

QUESTION;

How likely is it that a nonresident

8

would seek to register a car in New York — or in

9

Vermont?

10

MR. WILLIAMS;

Wall, I think that it does

11

happen.

12

insurance rates, people in neighboring states often

13

register their cars in Vermont.

I think that especially because of different

QUESTION;

15

MR. WILLIAMS:

16

and

19

20
21

Yes.

I think it does happen

I —

17
18

Rather than in their home state?

QUESTION;

Well,

that isn’t your case,

though?
MR. WILLIAMS:

It’s not my case at all; no.

just note that it does go on.
I believe that there’s no rational basis for

22

that sort of discrimination.

23

strict scrutiny test is the test to apply because —

24
25

QUESTION:

However, I believe the

Well, Mr. Williams, doesn’t each

state in which a vehicle is used have a legitimate

I

1

interest in imposing taxes for the benefit of the roads

2

in the state in which the vehicle is used?

3

MR. WILLIAMS;

Absolutely, Your Honor.

But

4

why should Vermont be able to charge me and not charge a

5

resident for the use of the roads?

6

that I have under the equal protection clause.

7

QUESTION;

That is the problem

Of course, even if you win, you may

8

not win.

9

violation might be to go back, and charge all

10
11

I mean the remedy for the equal protection

Vermcnters.
MR. WILLIAMS;

Well, that would be one way tc

12

cure the equal protection claim.

13

in order to do that, the legislature would have to face

14

the entire constituency of Vermont.

15

to discriminate just against nonresidents who don't have

16

a voice in the legislature.

17

I agree.

I think that

It wouldn't be able

However, they could certainly do that.

I

18

think that would raise commerce clause questions, which

19

I address in part three of the brief.

20

it would take care of the discrimination.

21

But I think that

I also think this tax — the discrimination

22

violates the privileges and immunities clause under

23

cases like Zobel or cases like Austin v. New Hampshire

24

and Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Zobel, not the

25

main opinion in Zobel.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

In Austin, this Court said clearly that a

2

state cannot impose a higher tax burden on nonresidents

3

than it does on residents in exactly the same

4

circumstances.

5

the privileges and immunities clause.

6

That is one right that is protected by

QUESTION*

Well, Mr. Williams, is it your

7

claim that the vehicle that you purchased when you did

8

not live in Vermont was never used outside the State of

9

Vermont?

10
11

MR. WILLIAMS;

No.

That’s net my contention.

I used —

12

QUESTION;

13

MR. WILLIAMS;

14

QUESTION;

So the vehicle was used elsewhere?
Yes, it was.

And you think somehow it’s wrong

15

that each state can charge taxes for the use of the

16

vehicle while in that state?

17

MR. WILLIAMS;

No.

I don't" think it's wrong

18

that Vermont should be able to charge me a

it’s wrong that Vermont should be able to charge me a

20

tax but that it does not charge a tax to residents in

the same circumstances.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

I think it’s clear that the privileges clause

2

protects unequal taxation burdens, protects nonresidents

3

against unequal taxation burdens, and —

4

QUESTION:

Maybe this is way out in left

5

field, but how many people are in the same position

6

you’re in —

7

MB. WILLIAMS:

8

QUESTION:

9

HR. WILLIAMS:

I --

-- would you estimate?
I checked the census, and it

10

appears to me that about 14,000 people are moving to

11

Vermont every year.

12

percentage of those people own cars.

13

fourth of those people own cars.

14

I don’t know exactly what
Perhaps a third, a

The Attorney General has said that the tax

15

brings in about a million dollars a year.

16

I think is the illegal part of the tax brings in about a

17

million dollars a year to the State of Vermont.

18

course, none of this is in the record because this comes

19

up on a motion to dismiss.

20

This — what

But, of

Once the privileges and immunities clause

21

applies, then the Court is to look at whether

22

nonresidents constitute a peculiar source of evil.

23

this case I suppose, do nonresidents do a

24

disproportionate share of road damage?

25

obvious that they don’t.

And I think it’s

I think that residents who

1

don't pay any tax probably do just as much damage, if

2

not more damage, to roads.

3

do damage; recreational vehicles, trailers, all sorts of

4

cars do road damage — people who don't pay taxes.

5
6

So there's no basis under the privileges and
immunities clause for charging this discriminatory tax.

7

The final point —

8

QUESTIONS

9

Mr. Williams, did you have to pay a

sales tax in Illinois when you bought your car?

10

HR. WILLIAMS;

11

QUESTION;

12

13

Trucks just passing through

Yes.

I paid a 7 percent tax.

Would a Vermont resident buying a

car in Illinois have to pay a sales tax?
HR. WILLIAMS;

Yes, if that Vermont resident

14

stayed longer than the two or three-week minimum

15

required by —

16
17

QUESTION;

Suppose he didn't.

Suppose he

stayed there two weeks and bought a car in Illinois.

18

MR. WILLIAMS;

19

QUESTION;

20

MR. WILLIAMS;

Then he would have a choice.

He would have a what?
He would have a choice, I

21

think, about whether to.pay Illinois or wait until he

22

got back to Vermont.

23

QUESTION;

24

MR. WILLIAMS;

25

So he need not pay a sales tax?
That's right; if he left within

two weeks he need not pay a sales tax.

2

In that connection, I point out what the Court
said in Austin.

3

QUESTION;

Then the differentiation between

4

the Illinois resident and the Vermont resident buying a

5

car in Illinois is not so great after all.

6

MR. WILLIAMS;

Yes, that’s right.

In that

7

case, the Vermonter pays the exact same amount that I

paid to Vermont.

situation because I, like I suppose almost everyone who

But that Vermonter isn’t in the same

10

moves to Vermont, used my car in Illinois longer than

11

two weeks after I bought it.

12

same situation would also pay the tax.

13

QUESTION;

And any Vermonter in that

Well, suppose he didn’t use it in

14

Illinois at all.

15

a good deal, and he bought it and shipped it right to

16

Vermont.

17

He just knew a dealer and he gave him

He wasn’t using Illinois roads, as you were.
MR. WILLIAMS;

That's right.

He wouldn’t have

18

to pay a tax to Illinois.

19

Illinois roads for two weeks.

think, that someone in my situation that used the roads

just to say it once more,

people in the same situation, Vermont residents in the

11

months in Illinois before bringing it back to Vermont.

12

I suppose just in the law of coincidences

13

there may be some people that that happens to, but it

14

would seem to me that it would be a fairly rare

15

situation.

HR. WILLIAMS;

Well, as you say it’s not — I

18

would be all that rare.

19

himself in another state for a couple of months,

20

especially a distant state, might well decide to buy a

21

car, to use it while he was there in that other state.

23

QUESTION;

I don’t think it

I think any Vermonter who found

Apparently the legislature thought

it happened often enough to provide for the exemption.

Right.

QUESTION:

5
6

Eight

Is it that group of people are the

only ones who qualify for the exemption?
MB. WILLIAMS:

Any Vermont resident who pays a

tax to another state qualifies for the exemption.
QUESTION:

So I mean the legislature

7

apparently, as Justice White says, thought there were

8

enough people in that category to justify creating a

9

special exemption for them.

10

ME. WILLIAMS:

11

I think that even apart from the

12

discrimination, the tax violates the commerce clause

13

because even if, as Justice White suggested, the

buy their car in Vermont for tax reasons alone.

Exactly.

For example, if I was moving to Vermont and

the prices of the cars were within a couple of

In this case, the fee isn’t apportioned.

It

is a one-time fee, a one-time tax that has very little,

if anything, to do with actual use or actual damage to

the roads.

it calls into question the commerce clause under what I

think is the modern analysis.

MR. ESCHEN;

Mr.

Then, in an act of her own free will, she

2

decided to become a Vermont resident and she moved to

3

Vermont and she engaged in employment in the state.

4

She's been in Vermont since 1979 and she’s been using

5

her vehicle in the state since 1979.

6

She registered her car in 1982,

and at that

7

time the State of Vermont simply asked if you are going

8

to use your car on our highways, you should pay a fee;

9

you should pay the same fee that we ask of any other

10

individual who wants to use a car in the State of

11

Vermont.

12

the use tax was based upon the value of the vehicle as

13

of the time it was registered in the State of Vermont,

14

as of the time she became a resident of the State of

15

Vermont.

16

And, the State of Vermont imposed a use tax, ad

She had used the car for over three years.

MR. ESCHENi

No, they would not. Your Honor.
I thought you said the registering

The registration in Vermont

triggers the tax liability in Vermont.

Prior to the

10

time a person becomes a resident, he has no obligation

11

to register the vehicle.

12

he*s obligated to register the vehicle, at which point

13

the tax is imposed.

Once he becomes a resident,

14

In the situation where a nonresident purchases

15

a car in his own state and then brings it to Vermont and

16

registers it in Vermont, he will not receive a credit.

17

The credit is available to a resident of Vermont who

18

subsequently acquires the motor vehicle and first

19

registers it in the State of Vermont.

20

If he first registers it outside the State of

21

Vermont and brings it. back to Vermont and registers it

22

in Vermont, he will be denied the credit.

Vermont is a very small state, but at the same

3

time we’re surrounded by Hew Hampshire, Massachusetts,

4

and New York, all of which have considerably larger and

5

accessible automobile markets.

6

What the legislature intended to do was simply

7

to give the Vermonter the option of exploring automobile

markets in other states.

if the car is purchased in a reciprocal state.

I’m sorry.

would be denied the exemption?

MR. ESCHEN;

When you read

the rest of the sentence, that is true; at least to the

Yes.

correct statement as far as it goes.

11

which brings into question, or brings into the case the

12

other statutes which are in pari materia, the state’s

registration statutes and the.state's residency laws.

14

And when the statutes are put together , as the

15

Commissioner has interpreted and as it has been argued

16

to the Vermont Supreme Court,, the credit is only

17

available if the resident first registers the car in the

18

State of Vermont.

19

because if the resident, if the purpose of the credit

20

provision is simply to enable the Vermonter to make a

21

quick trip to another state to make a purchase and to

22

return to Vermont to use the car in Vermont, as the

23

Court pointed out before, it’s unlikely that a resident

24

of Vermont is going to make a shopping trip in another

25

state and then actually register the car in the ?tate in

But I'm

You didn't file a response to the

jurisdictional state, did you?

6
7

HR. ESCHEN*

That raises another complicated

question, and that is —

8

QUESTION*

9

MR. ESCHEK*

You waived it.
We waived it because this case,

10

Williams, was based upon the decision of the Vermont

11

Supreme Court in Leverson.

12

actually the decision that's before the Court, we did

13

submit a motion to dismiss or affirm.

14

And in Leverson, which is

So when I received the jurisdictional

15

statement, I did send a letter to the Court indicating

16

that we were waiving the motion to dismiss because, as I

17

said, the case was decided on the basis of leverson and

18

we already submitted a motion to dismiss in that case.

19

The -- under the examples that I said before,

20

everybody who registers that car at the same time would

21

be paying the same amount of tax.

22

purchased the car in a reciprocal state and first

23

registered it in Vermont would pay ^110.

24

Kept by the reciprocal state, but that individual has

25

only acquired a singular privilege of driving in Vermont.

The resident who

It would be

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

By not registering the car in that other

2

state, he has acquired no privileges in that state,

3

except perhaps the temporary privileges that may attend

4

the intransit registration.

5

Just about all states provide that a

6

nonresident can avoid paying the sales tax on an

7

automobile purchase if he or she obtains an in-transit

8

registration rather than a permanent registration. And

9

that's what the legislature was envisioning when it

10

enacted this credit provision, to simly enable the

11

Vermonter to make the quick trip, come back to Vermont,

12

and register the car in Vermont.

13

In the case where the resident first registers

14

the vehicle in the other state and then returns to

15

Vermont and registers the car in Vermont, he is not

16

extended a credit, and justifiably.

17

the individual has acquired the privilege of using the

18

vehicle in several states, in two states.

19

fair that if he is going to use -- or if he's obtained

20

this privilege, that he should pay each state.

21

In that situation,

And it's only

The Court has long recognized that the use tax

22

is a legitimate means of raising revenue.

23

of Vermont is certainly within its authority to ask the

24

Appellants in this case, once they becone residents of

25

the state, to pay the use tax.

And the State

Similarly, the states are within their

2

authority to impose a sales tax.

3

Mr. Williams is complaining that the one-time fee

4

imposed by the State of Vermont in the amount of 4

5

percent of the value of a vehicle as of the time it. is

6

registered in Vermont is unfair, yet he’s not

7

complaining about the one-time fee that he had to pay to

8

Illinois when he purchased the car there.

I find it ironic that

I think really what the situation presents —

QUESTION:

Anybody who is — any Vermont

11

resident who is entitled to the credit, whatever that

12

condition might be, doesn’t pay for the use of the

13

Vermont roads.

14

MR. ESCHEN:

15

QUESTION:

16

Well, Your Honor, he does.
Well, you mean because he's paid it

to the other state and the state is a reciprocal state?

17

MR. ESCHEN:

18

QUESTION:

That’s correct. Your Honor.
Well, it doesn’t help him much.

19

mean it helps him a lot, I guess, but it doesn’t help

20

people who don’t get the credit.

21

MR. ESCHEN:

I

Well, that’s right. Your Honor,

22

but there’s a reason why Mr. Williams should not get the

23

credit.

24

it means that Mr. Williams will have paid to the State

25

of Vermont absolutely nothing.

If Mr. Williams gets the credit in this case,

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

He will acquire the same privilege of using

2

the car in Vermont that any other individual would have

3

to pay for.

4

And tht --

QUESTION*

Well, you’re saying because of

reciprocity, the Vermont resident who gets the credit is

22

MR. ESCHEN;

Well, Your Honor, the facts of

the Vermont Supreme Court concluded that there was nc

6

KR. ESCHEN*

To say the least.
But I submit that the decision

7

has been made by the court, and that under Vermont law

8

the Commissioner *s interpretation has been accepted.

The privileges and immunities challenge, I

10

believe, is also without merit.

11

imposed only after the Appellants became residents of

12

the State of Vermont.

Again, the tax was

standing as to whether they could challenge it under the

privileges and immunities clause.

23

could, again the interest in this case is certainly not

an interest of the same caliber as the Court has

recognized in other privileges and immunities cases —

The commerce clause issue I submit is also
with merit.

The Appellants contend that there is a

requirement of apportionment; yet, they hardly define

11

what they mean by apportionment.

12

they disagree with a tax based upon the value of a

vehicle, the decision of the court in Capital Greyhound

14

Lines v. Brice is dispositive of that contention.

15

To the extent that

To the extent that they claim that

16

apportionment is required to reflect prior use in the

other state, I submit that the Vermont tax scheme

18

whereby the vehicle is taxed on the value as of the time

it is used in the State of Vermont, registered in the

I would conclude, Your Honors, by saying that
the statute is unclear and it was for that reason that

The

Vermont Supreme Court concluded that there was no
discrimination.

I have made representations to the

Court as to how this statute and the tax provisions are
administered.

Those are based upon my discussions with

the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles and other officials
in the department. That is their representation of how
it is administered.
I have no reason to disagree with that.

I can

very well appreciate the Court’s concern about the
Vermont Supreme Court’s decision in not specifically
addressing the scenarios that I have addressed to the
Court today, but I would nevertheless submit that the
interpretation that we have advanced is an
interpretation that would show that there is equality of
treatment by the State of Vermont.
