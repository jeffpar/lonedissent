ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. KAMMHOLZ;

of the

Mr. Chief Justice and members

Court;
At issue in this case is the extent to which a

8
9

Mr. Kammholz, you may

state,

by application of state law, may regulate the

10

legal obligations of parties to a

collective bargaining

11

agreement and adjudicate the legal consequences of the

12

breach of such agreement.
A majority of the Wisconsin supreme court held

13
14

that Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act

15

of 1947 did not preempt a state court suit brought by a

16

union employee against his employer, alleging tortious

17

bad faith in the administrative handling of a disability

18

claim,

19

derived entirely from a collective bargaining agreement,

20

and the employee did not resort to the contractual

21

grievance procedure which included arbitration at the

22

terminal level.

23

even though the employee's right to benefits

With respect to the circuit court suit,

Allis-Chalmers ani Aetna raised two defenses.

that the suit was preempted by

The record does not show this.

It may

show it, the case went up cn summary judgment.

further appealed to the Wisconsin supreme court with

principles cf state insurance law, held that any

2

violation of the labor agreement was irrelevant to the

3

issue of bad faith handling of the disability claim.

4

Further, the court said there was no 301 presumption

5

"even though the insurance contract is part of a labor

6

agreement otherwise governed by federal law."

implication, the court further hell that there was no

Well,

you would have hoped the Wisconsin court would say is

we'll

stay it while we send you to, under Boys Market,

11

to exhaust your administrative remedies and. end up in

12

arbitration.

That's what you wanted, wasn't it?

MR. KAMMHOLZ:

13

Yes.

The Wisconsin court did

14

confuse the preemption doctrine under 301

with the

15

preemption doctrine under NLRA, Sections 7 and 8.
We assert that the 70 -- that the 301 doctrine

and ERISA.

Mr.

Chief Justice, members of

the Court:

15

Before proceeding into my response to Mr.

16

Kammholz's argument, I'd like to clarify a few of the

17

facts that I believe are part of the record.

18

First of all, while *r. Kammholz does admit to

19

the fact that these disability benefits on behalf of Mr.

20

Lueck

21

that Mr. Lueck received these benefits only after

22

Allis-Chalmers and Aetna Insurance Company were served

23

with his cause of action.

24
25

were eventually received, the record should show

QUESTION:

Did

the claim -- did

his claim

arise out of the union contract?

1

MR. BOISITS:

2

QUESTION:

3

Excuse me, Your Honor.

Did his claim arise under the union

contra ct?

4

NR. BOISITS:

Your Honor, yes and no,

all

5

right.

First of all, as far as the union contract is

6

concerned,

7

provides for the normal things that a labor contract

8

provides for -- labor, conditions of employment, wages,

9

that type of thing.

we've got a contract that on one hand

Then we have a peripheral thing

10

where the insurance or the employer has, in addition,

11

provided some health benefits and -QUESTION:

12
13

Did that derive from an agreement

between the company and the union?
NR. BOISITS;

14

It did come from the agreement.

15

It's specifically mentioned in the union contract.

16

was something that was negotiated.

17

that.

It

I can’t argue with

The problem I have in looking at the case is

18
19

primarily the situation where they've accepted the

20

obligations to insure Nr. Iueck under a disability

21

policy,

22

of an

23

of Section 301

24

state recognizes as mandatory as far as someone that's

25

acting as an insurance company.

and they've therefore basically put on the hat

insurance company and are now attempting by virtue
to avoid

some of the obligations that the

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

And in that situation, Nr.

1

Lueck is really

2

caught between a rock and a hard place basically,

3

because he can go through the union procedures, and

4

what's basically provided under those union procedures

5

is that he’s going to collect whatever disability

6

benefits he's entitled to if they were denied, and

7

perhaps maybe seme interest that he lost -- that's not

8

clear by the contrac t -- and that's it.

9

employ er can th erefore basically be entit led to a f ree

10

The in suring

play w ith his insuranc e benefits.
QUESTION;

11

Well,

that's what happens under

12

collective bargaining agreements all the time where you

13

have to go through

14

to be -- you have to settle for whatever you get cut of

15

the grievance or the abitrator.

Yes, but basically as far as an

22

-- when the employer acts as an insurer, there are ether

obligations that the state feels that are very

important.

decision will be final and binding, and that’s all you

20

get.

21

MR. BOISITS;

As far as disability benefits

22

are concerned, but the state interest, the interest that

the Wisconsin -- that the State of Wisconsin, as well as

24

the Wisconsin majority, indicated was look at, we cannot

25

allow an employer to hide under a Section 301 case, or

they can deny him payments again.

the Court, at least as far as the philosophy is
respect to the

preemption situation.
A short note;

the Garman preemption arguments

24

as presented by myself were originally brought up in the

25

circuit court and determined by Justice Lamponi in tha
29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

Circuit court on the two grounds;

one, Section 301

2

preemption;- and number two, on the basis of Carman.

3

That argument was brought all the way through the

4

Wisconsin courts, and that's why the Wisconsin court

5

relied heavily on the Carman argument, primarily because

6

it was raised by opposing counsel and Allis-Chalmers .
I'd like to bring out just two points as far

7

8

as the Carman premptions considerations are.

The Court

9

did appear hard-pressed when they talked about, say,

10

emotional distress in the Farmer decision.

11

words,

12

the Court wanted to make perfectly clear that as far as

13

the emotional distress situation is concerned, that that

14

would have to be something completely separate out of

15

this wage and conditions of employment argument.

16

the -- the -- we have to -- we have to look at the type

17

of conduct that was promulgated by the tort feasor.

18

other words, in that case it was my understanding that

19

the emotional distress was a function of the

20

particularly abusive manner in which the claimant was

21

handled by the union officials, and that the matters

22

dealing with the negotiation of the contract or the

23

rates under the contract were completely separate.

24
25

In other

it appeared to me as reading the decision that

That

In

And you can see, at least from my reading of
it, it seems that this Court has attempted to

particularly abusive manner in which he was treated

4

that's separate and distinct from the labor contract,

5

and that yes, he can go through the remedies that are

6

afforded by the labor contract, and yes, he can go into

7

state court and go after that separate tort and the

8

remedies that are available there.

That’s basically all that Mr. Lueck

He’s attempting to show that there was a

13

hand in hand.

They can go

They do not necessarily butt heads.

14

Another argument as far as the Garman

15

philosophy is concerned is that the Section 301

16

preemption argument is incorporated in the Garman

17

exceptions.

18

it talks of whether or not the action is one of

19

20

like what happened -- the provisions in the labor
