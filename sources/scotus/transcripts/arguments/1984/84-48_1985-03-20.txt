OPAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. STRAUSSi

Thank you, Nr.

Chief Justice,

10

and may it please the Court, in this case the Court of

11

Appeals for the Ninth Circuit awarded respondent a new

12

trial on the ground that the government had not

13

disclosed to respondent certain documents in its files

14

that respondent claims he could have used to impeach two

15

government witnesses.

16

The issue concerns the standard of materiality

17

that should be applied in determining whether such

18

evidence is significant enough to require a new trial.

19

The respondent in this case was indicted in

20

1977 cn multiple counts of violating federal narcotics

21

and firearms statutes.

22

on

23

requests.

24
25

Before trial, respondent served

the government eleven broadly worded discovery

Among those requests was the one that has now
become the focus of the case, a request for any deals,

1

promises, or inducements made to prospective government

2

witnesses in exchange for their testimony.

3

In response to all the various discovery

4

requests, the government gave the defense a large number

5

of documents.

6

trial, and he was tried by District Judge Vorhees of the

7

Western District of Washington.
Among the witnesses against him were two state

8
9

How, respondent elected to waive a jury

law enforcement officers name!

O'Connor and Mitchell,

10

who had witnessed criminal transactions involving

11

respondent while they were operating in an undercover

12

capacity.
O’Connor and Mitchell were supervised during

13
14

the investigation of respondent by the Federal Bureau cf

15

Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, AFT.

16

and Mitchell testified primarily about the firearms

17

charges.

18

At trial, O’Conner

Now, after the seven-day trial,

Judge Vorhees

19

found, respondent not guilty on the firearms charges, but

20

guilty on the narcotics charges.

21

respondent filed a Freedom of Information Act request,

22

and he uncovered two form ATF contracts that had been

23

signed by O’Connor and Mitchell before the trial, but

24

that were not among the materials delivered by the

25

government to the defense.

Some years later,

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Respondent then brought this action for

2

collateral relief under 28 USC 2255, alleging that if he

3

had known of these form contracts at the time of the

4

trial he could have used them to impeach O'Connor and

5

Mitchell.

6

Respondent's 2255 motion came before Judge

7

Vorhees .

8

had teen unaware of the form contracts, which apparently

9

were in ATF files,

10

The prosecutor testified at a hearing that he

and

that if he had been aware of

them, he would have given them to respondent.

11

Judge Vorhees found that well after the trial

12

O'Connor and Mitchell were each paid $300 by ATF, but

13

that the ATF form contracts were blank

14

Mitchell signed them,

15

them until after the trial, and that no government agent

16

at any time had promised O’Connor or Mitchell

17

compensation for his services or his testimony or

18

anything else.

19

Judge Vorhees further found that O'Connor and

might receive some compensation for their services,

24

although not necessarily for their testimo ny.

25

Finally,

Yes, that is right

Judge Vorhees ruled tha t since he

1

himself had found respondent guilty, he was uniguely

2

positioned to determine the impact that the AFT form

3

contracts would have had on

4

that he was convineed beyond a reasonable doubt that the

5

form contracts would have made no difference to his

6

verdict.

7

Now,

the trial, and he stated

as I said at the outset, the Court of

8

Appeals reversed and ordered that respondent be granted

9

a new trial.

This happened in 1983, six years after

10

respondent was convicted.

11

explain at any point in its opinion why Judge Vorhees

12

was mistaken in concluding beyond a reasonable doubt

13

that his own verdict would not have been affected by the

14

form contracts.

15

Instead,

The Court of Appeals did net

the Court of Appeals stated, and I am

16

reading the last sentence of its opinion,

17

the government's failure to provide requested Brady

18

information to the respondent so that he could

19

20

witnesses requires an automatic reversal."

QUESTION;

Did this material relate to the

I think it would have been very

15

the law in this area is that it really makes no sense

16

for the United States attorney not to oo overboard and

17

to do far more than he is obligated to do, because if he

18

doesn't, what is likely to happen is just what happened

discrediting them.

2

magnitude that it impacted the constitutional rights of

reverse under the harmless error doctrine.

5

And if there is government interference in

6

that process, actual government obstruction, then it is

7

presumptive error, and wa submit, and the Court of

8

Appeals found in this case that the government's failure

to disclose and their affirmations that these witnesses

had had no promises concerning rewards, it was

tantamount to government interference with

of counsel to conduct his defense.

Rut the effect of that language, of course,

analyzed the materiality, and of course the Court of

25

15

Do we send it back?
MR. HILLIERs

That is not necessary, Your

16

Honor.

17

language is improvident within the context of this

18

decision, and that in looking at Giglio, there is a

19

requirement of materiality in non-disclosure cases, but

20

in this case there was materiality, so the result cf the

21

Court of Appeals was correct, but this does not mean

22

that there is an automatic reversal rule that each case

23

has to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, and

24

instruction should be sent forward to the Courts of

25

Appeals.

I think

what is necessary is to say that the

argument is, the government here did fail to disclose

failures are seldom, if ever, excusable.

at the character of the evidence, as urged in the Agurs

Your Honor, because there was a

I am asking you now under the test

in Agurs for a general request.

12

MR. HILLIER*

Yes.

I agree with the Solicitor

13

General that the analysis of that kind of error is a

14

non-constitutional analysis.

15

It becomes constitutional error if the

16

defendant is able to meet his burden of persuasion in

17

that case of showing that notwithstanding the

18

non-ccnstitutional nature of the disclosure in this

19

case, the failure to disclose,

20

non-constitutional because there is no specific request,

21

or the prosecutor wasn't put in a position where he had

22

to respond, or the prosecutor responded dishonestly,

23

then the defense bears the burden of showing that it

24

interrupted the fair trial

25

case.

you are correct that there was an error.

11

MR. HILLIER;

No, Your Honor, it would not be,

12

because Strickland was referring to the

13

non-ccnstitutional errcr aspect of the Agurs decision.

14

It is our position -- and Agurs indicated that to

15

determine whether it is constitutional or

16

non-constitutional , you look to the character of

17

evidence.

that a request for all Brady material or all helpful

material would be a general request.

But the Court left open the possibility that a

standard.

that defense counsel have tried to take the general

10

dozen or so abstract categories, all deals, promises,

and inducements, all information casting doubt on the

They have tried to rephrase the general

14

request into requests that while not as

15

all-encompassing, when taken together cover the

16

essentially the way he presented his requests.

that when the prosecutor

received these discovery requests, he should have gone

That is our point exactly.

These were essentially general requests that

He would have had to

Sc the Agurs-Strickland test or

standard is the appropriate one in your view?

8

MR. STRAUSS:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

The brief was a little vague that

10

the gcvernmen4- filed, and I didn't understand what the

11

government thought.

12

MR. STRAUSS:

We think there are some true

13

specific request cases where you have a truly focused

14

specific request where an argument can be made for a

15

more exacting standard than Agurs.

16

QUESTION:

Do you understand Agurs and

17

Strickland to say that there is no constitutional

18

violation at all unless what was done or not done would

19

have created a reasonable doubt that otherwise would not

20

have existed?

21

MR. STRAUSS:

22

QUESTION:

That is right.

And so if such a doubt exists,

23

there is no occasion or reason to reach the harmless

24

error.

25

MR. STRAUSS:

That’s right, because then you
