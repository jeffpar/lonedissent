Mr. Ennis, ycu may

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE JAMES ENNIS, JR., ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. ENNISi

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

7

please the Court, the question is whether the Federal

8

Government's need to obtain information about candidates

9

seeking appointment to federal office, together with the

10
11

right of a citizen to provide that information in a
»
petition addressed only to appropriate federal

12

officials, requires the same immunity from common law

13

libel actions this Court has already afforded both

14

citizens and governmental officials in a bread range cf

15

other circum stances in which providing only qualified

16

immunity would unduly impair the effective functioning

17

of government.

18

In each of those other circumstances, the fact

19

that immunity would protect not only truthful and useful

20

communincations, but also, on occasion, knowingly false

21

and defamatory communications, has been considered a

22

necessary cost of government.

23

As Justice Harlan wrote for the Court in Barr

24

v. Matteo, affording executive officials immunity from

25

libel actions alleging knowing falsity, "It has been

thought in the end better to leave unredressed the

2

wrongs done by dishonest officers than to subject these

3

who try to do their duty to the constant dread of

4

ret aliation

5

6

QUESTION;

Sr. Ennis, do you read any

constitutional dimension into Barr v. Matteo?

7

SR. ENNIS;

So, Your Honor, I do not.

I

8

believe that Barr v. Matteo and other decisions of this

9

Court affording immunity to governmental officials is

10

not based on any specific clause of the Constitution.

11

None was referred to.

12

constitutional decisions in the sense that the Court

13

felt that the very constitutional structure of our

14

goverment required such immunity.

15

QUESTION;

But I do believe they were

I never read Barr v. -- I don't

Matteo.

Columbia doctrine.

19

I've always thought it was a District of

MR. ENNIS;

Your Honor, there is not a word

20

about the Constitution in Barr v. Matteo, but the Court

21

nevertheless thought, even though there was no

22

constitutional right of a governmental official at

23

issue, that the effective functioning of the government

24

itself was sufficient to require the rule of immunity.

25

In this case, we have not only that same
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

governmental interest, but in addition the interest of

2

the citizen critic expressly grounded in the petition

3

clause of the First Amendment.

4

QUESTION;

Well, what’s the source of the law

5

we're dealing with here?

6

constitutional law?

7

Carolina libel laws, wasn't it?

8
9

ME. ENNIS;

The case was tried under North

The case has not yet been tried,

Your Honor.

10

QUESTION;

11

Carolina libel law?

12

Is it all -- is it just

MR. ENNISi

Would it be tried under North

It would be tried under North

13

Carolina libel law as that law is modified and governed

14

by the federal Constitution and also by the needs of the

15

Federal Government to receive information.

16

For example, the Court has also ruled, net

17

relying on any specific constitutional provision, that

18

citizens have a right to provide information about

19

criminal offenses to government; they have a right to

20

testify before legislative and judicial bodies; and they

21

have a right to provide petitions to the judical branch

22

of government, and they would be absolutely immune from

23

libel actions in each of those circumstances.

24

no mere in this case.

25

We seek

In our view, there are two separate but in

(202) 628-9300

1

this case coinciding interests which require immunity.

2

The first is the interest of the Federal Government in

3

effective functioning and the second is the interest of

4

the citizen critic in providing the information the

5

government needs to function effectively.

6

The basic facts —

7

QUESTION;

Well, you wouldn't say that it’s

8

necessary for the essential function of government to

9

operate on false information.

10

ME. ENNIS;

Justice White, I know that you

11

have taken pains to concur in several decisions

12

stressing that the Constitution does not directly

13

protect knowingly false information.

14
15
16
17

QUESTION;
that, too.
MR. ENNIS;

QUESTION;

19

MR. ENNIS;

21

Yes, the Court has agreed with

that, Your Honor.

18

20

And the Court has already said

Yes.
We do not contend that it does,

and we do not need to contend that it does.
QUESTION;

But you have to make some other

22

kind of an argument.

23

you have to lie — you have to accept some lies in order

24

to get enough of the truth.

25

MR. ENNIS;

You have to make an argument that

That's exactly the argument that

QUESTION;

But that may be true on one side cf

3

your argument, on the government interest, but what

4

about the individual?

5

MR. ENNIS;

6

QUESTION;

They are —
Does he have to be able knowingly

7

to lie in order to give decent information to the

8

government?

Knowingly lie.

MR. ENNIS;

Your Honor, we are not seeking

protection for the right tc knowingly lie.

QUESTION:

Well, you are.

12

immunity.

13

whether he's lying or not.

14

You say absolutely

It doesn't make any difference, you say,

MR. ENNIS;

Your Honor, we're seeking

15

protection for the right to petition the government and

16

to provide information to the governmen.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ENNIS:

19

20

ftnd to tell lies in the process.
Even if there may occasionally be

knowing lies in the process.
QUESTION:

Well, what about on those occasions

21

when he knowingly lies?

22

what basis has he got to claim absolute immunity?

23

MR. ENNIS:

Now, what possible excuse —:

His basis, Your Honor, is the same

24

basis that the United States itself identified in the

25

case of Webb v. Fury.

We don't have to speculate about

the federal interest.

2

States formally and explicitly took the position that

3

citizens should be absolutely immune from common law

4

libel actions when they provide petitions to federal

5

agencies, even if those petitions are alleged to be

6

knowingly false.

In Webb v. Fury, the United

Pardon me, Your Honor?
Alleged to be.
Alleged to be.

That is all that

is true in this case as well, Your Honor.
The reason for that was that any lesser degree

14

of immunity, said the United States, would deprive the

15

government of the information it needs to govern.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. ENNIS:

Because?
Because both governmental

18

officials and citizens would be deterred from providing

19

truthful and useful information to the government if

20

they knew that merely upon an allegation that their

21

communications were knowingly false, they would be

22

required to spend literally thousands cf dollars in

23

unrecoverable defense costs to defend the truth of their

24

statements.

25

That would silence both governmental officials

extraordinary length of filing both an amicus brief and

QUESTIONj

Have they filed any brief in this

cae?
NR. ENNIS:

No, they have not, Your Honor.

I

14

think that the interest of the Federal Government is on

15

its face and, given Webb v. Fury,

16

there be any doubt about that, the Court could of course

invite the Solicitor General to follow through.

But if

I think the Solicitor General is

19

usually quite aware when he figures the government’s

20

interests are involved.

21

NR. ENNIS:

22

QUESTION:

That's correct. Your Honor.
Mr. Ennis, if a witness testifies

23

in ccurt, even in a matter of grave concern to the

24

government, if the witness testifies falsely, the

25

witness can be tried for perjury, can he not?

1

MR. ENNIS:

2

QUESTION:

That’s correct, Your Honor.
And yet there certainly is as great

3

an interest in those circumstances in obtaining truthful

4

information, both for the government and from the

5

witness’s standpoint.

6

circumstances, the witness isn't deterred from giving

7

the truth, speaking the truth, because — despite the

8

threat of prosecution for perjury.

MR. ENNIS:

And I take it in those

Isn’t that right?

That is correct. Your Honor,

and

it raises a very important distinction.

12

perjury prosecutions, but they are immune from common

13

law libel actions.

14

Witnesses who

15

possible sanction.

17

to the government, whether it’s defamatory of a third

18

party or not.

19

For example, the Federal Government

We are not seeking immunity from that kind of

20

prosecution or from other sanctions.

21

seeking the same immunity from common law libel actions

22

that witnesses in judicial proceedings already have.

QUESTION:

We are only

But are not witnesses there, other

than by their own free will?
MR. ENNIS:

Some witnesses, Your Honor, are

by their own free will.

3

QUESTIONS

Others are there

But the doctrine --

Once they are there,

they are

4

compelled to answer all relevant questions, are they

5

not?

6
7

ME. ENNISi

That’s certainly correct,

Your Honor, but the rule applies not only to witnesses;

„8

even persons who simply file complaints with the

9

judicial branch are absolutely immune from common law

10

libel actions based on the statements contained in their

11

complaints, and no one has compelled them to file such a

12

complaint.

13
14
15

QUESTIONS

Mr. Ennis — oh, excuse me.

Finish

your answer .
MR. ENNISi

I see no compelling justification

16

for affording petitions to the judicial branch of

17

government immunity from common law libel actions, and

18

not affording the same immunity for petitions to the

19

legislative and executive branches, particularly when

20

the petition is directly relevant to an important

21

decision then under consideration by the executive and

22

legislative branches.

23

There is no presumption, if I may say so,

24

Your Honor, that it is more important to protect

25

petitions to the judicial branch than it is to protect

QUESTION:

That's good background for the

question I was going to ask you about the scope of your

position.

to the cabinet, or district attorney, somebody like

6

this.

Supposing you have somebody who's nominated

7

KR. ENNIS:

QUESTION:

10

I'm sorry.

I did not hear.

A nominee for some office that

requires confirmation of the Senate.

And say a large

pressure group like one of the big trade associations or
\

11

the National Rifle Association have decided to oppose

12

him.

13

thousands of false letters accusing him of all sorts of

14

personal wrongdoing and all the rest, and misstating his

15

position and all the rest,

16

— would all those letters be immune from any kind of

17

libel action?

18

Could they get together and write literally

19

theory of the case, so long as the letters were

addressed to appropriate officials of the Federal

QUESTIONS

Which is probably the only sanction

that’s available for deliberate falsehooi of that kind.

4

MS. ENNIS;

Well, as I’ve indicated, there are

5

already on the books statutes making it a crime to

6

provide false information to the Federal Government, and

7

he certainly could be prosecuted for that.

8
9

It is also conceivable, though I do not
concede the point,

that a state criminal prosecution for

10

criminal libel could be pursued, though I am not willing

11

to concede that such a prosecution would survive

QUESTIONi

What kind of a constitutional

14

immunity is it that just protects you from a civil

remedy but not from a criminal remedy?

MR. ENNIS;

17

criminal remedy would be different.

satisfied with a rule that would allow the Federal

2

Government to prosecute the person for sending the same

3

communication?

4

MR. ENNIS;

Because, Your Honor, I'm making

5

the same distinction I made in response to the question

6

asked by Justice O'Connor, and that is, we are not

7

seeking immunity from every conceivable sanction.

8

are only seeking immunity from one particular sanction

9

which is particularly likely to silence critics of —

10
11
12

QUESTION;

We

Where do you find that distinction

in the language of the Constitution?
MR. ENNIS;

I find that distinction in this

13

Court's decisions. This Court has already ruled that

14

judges, legislators, and executive officials are immune,

15

not from every sanction, but immune from common law

16

libel actions, even if their statements are alleged to

17

be defamatory and knowingly false.

18

The Court —

19

QUESTION;

20
21

Those are — a s Justice Rehnquist

points out, those are not constitut ional decisions,
MR. ENNIS;

I believe the y are constitutional

22

in the sense, Your Honor, that they derive from the very

23

structure of a republican form

24

like the slaughterhouse cases, like In Pe Quarles, like

25

all cf the foundation cases on whic h our Constitution

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

2

and jurisprudence is based.
The Court in every one of those cases said

3

that that kind of immunity, in the circumstances of that

4

case, was necessary in order to ensure the effective

5

functioning of government. That's the literal language

6

used in those cases.

7

I see no distinction here.

The government was

8

actively considering an important governmental decision

9

-- whether to appoint Respondent to the office of United

10

States Attorney, the chief law enforcement office in the

11

Kiddle District of North Carolina.

12

That was obviously an important decision.

It

13

required nomination by the President and the advice .and

14

consent of the Senate. This was not some low level

17

needed to obtain relevant information.

Absolutely immune?

11

HR. ENNISi

Yes, Your Honor.

If you were

12

making a decision whether to hire a certain person, for

13

example, as your law clerk and if a citizen had

14

information concerning the qualifications of that

15

person, I would take the position that the citizen would

16

have the right to send you a letter expressing his views

17

and that those views would be immune from a civil libel

18

action, though not from other possible sanctions,

whether they are true or false.

MR. ENNIS;

Your Honor, both because of

republican form of government — that's the federal

interest — and also because of the petition clause of

the First Amendment.

clause, I think, is overwhelmingly clear.

In fact,

QUESTION;

9

The history of the petition

the Respondent does not even deny -I think it’s one of the clearest

puddles of mud I've seen in a long time.
MR. ENNIS;

Well, Your Honor, I don’t wish to

10

seem disrespectful, but in our brief we refer to the

11

fact that in a parliamentary resolution of 1669, in Lake

12

v. King in 1680, in the Seven Bishops case of 1688,

13

the English Bill of Rights of 1689, in a host of other

14

authorities, English law that was known to the framers

15

provided absolute immunity to British subjects when they

16

petitioned either Parliament or the king.

provision.
KB. ENNIS;

No.

That is a broader rule than

we are contending for in this case.

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. ENNIS;

How much broader is it?
Quite a bit broader.

We are only

15

asking the Court to rule in the narrow circumstances of

this case, and that involves three important

The citizen critic should not be forced to

Let me continue by saying that —

12

QUESTION:

Nr. Ennis, isn’t there a basic

13

difference in the justification for immunity and libel

14

or defamation actions for witnesses in judicial

15

proceedings, simply because they’re subject to

16

cross-examination to get at the truth?

17

Their statements occur in a framework where

18

it's possible to know whether they’re speaking the truth

19

or net, at least by our standards.

20

for absolute immunity in a situation where someone just

21

submits a letter and is not open to cross-examination

22

for it.

And it seems to me to have some basic

24

differences.

really only to judicial proceedings and witnesses and
not as you have described.
ME. ENNIS;

Well, Your Honor, I must

respectfully disagree about the common law history.

But

on the other question you asked, that is obviously an
important point; that witnesses in judicial proceedings
are subject to cross-examination.
The rule, however, of immunity applies not
only to witnesses but also to complainants in judicial
proceedings.

The complaint itself is immune.

And there

may or may not be occasion for testing the truth, of
allegations in a complaint. The complaint may never get
served, it may not —
QUESTION;

Well, they can have the opportunity

for a formal response.

It’s in a setting where it lends

itself to a response.
MS. ENNIS;

Yes,

that's right.

And in the situation you described,

the person about whom the letter is written may never
know what was written at all.
MR. ENNIS;

Yes.

Let me respond to that,

Your Honor.

There's no notice, there's no

Your Honor, because that’s very similar to one argument

2

raised by the Respondent that this was a secret

3

petition.

In fact, it was not, for four reasons.

4

First, a secret --

5

QUESTION*

But the rule you pose would cover

6

something just submitted that the person about whom it’s

7

written would never know.

8
9

MR. ENNISi

The rule I propose is no different

than the rule this Court has already adopted in both

10

Quarles and Vogel v. Gruz.

11

that the subject of a petition to the Federal Government

12

cannot compel the disclosure of that petition to himself

13

or tc anyone else without the "permission or assent” of

14

the Federal Government.

15

This Court has already ruled

Because the Court recognized that the

16

government has such an important need in receiving that

17

information, that the Federal Government should be free

18

to decide for itself whether to pass on a communication

19

to the subject of the communication.

20

rule this Court has adopted.

Third —

about is a petition to Federal Government.
The fourth point I'd like to make on that
secrecy argument is that the Respondent, I think
disingenuously suggests in his answering brief, that he
did not have an ample opportunity to respond.
he did.

The record in this case is clear,

In fact#

as the

deposition of Congressman Johnston makes clear, that the
Respondent promptly received copies of both letters from
Congressman Johnston, his friend, and Senator Helms, his
friend and sponsor, and that on January 19th and
February 27th he in fact wrote to Congressman Johnston
with enclosures, providing a detailed response to every
one cf petitioner's allegations.
So he did in fact have an ample opportunity to
respond, and that's in the record of this case.

This

A secret requires an

agreement by both parties to the communications to keep
it confidential between themselves.
My client did not demand or request that the
government keep his petition secret. To the contrary, he
offered to testify publicly, where he would have been
subject to cross-examination and penalties for perjury;
nor did he expect secrecy.

He is alleged to have sent

copies of his letters to Senator Helms and Congressman
Johnston, both of whom were friends and sponsors of the

Yes, it would, but I don't think

the Court needs to —

12

QUESTION:

Do you think the rule for which you

13

contend would have any tendency to increase the amount

14

of false communication?

15

MB. ENNIS:

No more, Your Honor, than the rule

16

this Court adopted in Parr v. Matteo for governmental

17

officials.

18

QUESTION:

That's not my question.

My

19

question is, do you think the rule for which you contend

20

would have any tendency to increase the amount of false

21

communication?

22

ME. ENNIS:

No, I do not think it would.

23

Your Honor, because the petitioner would still be

24

subject to penalties for providing false information to

25

the government.

On the contrary, though,

I think that a

25
'

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

rule granting petitioner's immunity from common law

2

libel actions would tend to encourage citizens to

3

provide truthful and useful information to the

4

government because they would no longer have to fear

5

spending $20, $40, $60, $80,000 in unrecoverable defense

6

costs if their communication was simply alleged to be

7

knowingly false.

8
9

Let me respond to one point that has not yet
come up, but is — since the Respondent really says

10

virtually nothing at all about our historical argument

11

that was known to the framers and nothing at all about

12

our functional analysis argument. Respondent talks only

13

about the petitions being secret and misdirected.

14

The argument about misdirected is that

15

petitioner's first letter was misdirected because he

16

sent it to Congressman-Elect Johnston and to

17

President-Elect Reagan before they had been sworn in.

18

But as the record makes clear, in November of

19

Respondent had applied for the position to

20

Congressman-Elect Johnson and to Senator Helms

21

requesting their assistance in obtaining the

22

appointment.

23

to seek the assistance of Congressman-Elect Johnston in

24

obtaining the appointment, it was no less appropriate

25

for the petitioner to write to the same

*80 the

If it was appropriate for the Respondent

2

Congressman-Elect Johnson to oppose the appointment.
It was widely reported in the press that there

3

was a transition team in place, chaired by Ed Meese,

4

that was then actively considering nominations.

5

fact, the Respondent alleges that he was an active

6

candidate, and that the President would be making

7

appointments as soon after he was sworn in as possible.

8

There is no more appropriate occasion for a citizen to

9

communicate with the Federal Government concerning a

10

candidate for Federal office than when the

11

decisionmaking process is actively underway.

12

In

Let me conclude -- and then I'd like to

13

reserve a few minutes for rebuttal — by simply

14

reminding the Court, as I'm sure it's aware, that the

15

deterrent effect we are talking about here is an

16

extraordinarily severe deterrent effect.

17

In fact, the Respondent concedes at page 18 cf

18

his brief that the potential cost of defending a libel

19

action is great, to use the Respondent's words.

20

relative cost for an ordinary citizen who does not have

21

libel defense insurance is even greater than the ccst

22

for a media defendant, such as the New York Times.

23

Let me pose a hypothetical.

And the

If North Carolina

24

tomorrow enacted a statute imposing a $20,000 tax on all

25

petitions to the Federal Government, can anyone doubt
27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that that would silence all petitions to the Federal

2

Government by everyone but the most wealthy or foolhardy

3

citizen?

4

But the $20,000 tax, though it's not paid to

5

the State of North Carolina, is the same in this case

6

under the common law rule.

7

$20,000 to his defense lawyers and to court reporters,

8

not to the State of North Carolina directly, but the

9

cost to him is the same and the deterrent effect on him

10
11

The petitioner must pay that

is the same.
If this Court does not grant absolute

12

immunity, I think it is clear that the message that will

13

go out to the citizens of this country is that they are

14

no longer free to criticize candidates or to criticize

15

wrongdoing by public officials, and that if they do so,

16

they do so at enormous economic cost to themselves.

17

QUESTION*

Of course, the message would always

18

say you certainly are protected, even if you give some

19

false information if you didn't know it was false.

20

the message might say if you deliberately sent in false

21

information, you'd better watch your Ps and Qs.

22

There would always be qualified immunity,

that’s correct.

16

question rests in the trial court, I suppose', because we

17

have, for the purposes of the motion from which this

18

appeal was taken, that question was yielded.

19

been yielded for the litigation generally, but except

20

for that question that’s exactly the standard.

21

standard that would be required under -- by New York

22

Times, and it’s a standard that existed in North

23

Carolina for just this type of — in Ponder v. Cobb,

24

there was a letter to a state official complaining of

25

local election officials.

So it's the same petitioning aspect.

2

QUESTION;

Well,

do you tend to agree that

3

anything short of that standard certainly would provide

4

a significant chilling effect on people who otherwise

5

might furnish information to public officials?

6

SR. EAGLES:

Well, I believe so. Your Honor.

7

If people who acted in good faith and on reasonable

8

grounds, the older cases discuss bona fide and probable

9

cause, use that kind of language, then a common law

>10

privilege did exist and should, and chilling would take

11

place in the absence of it.

12

Another point in terms of the cost of

13

litigation that is made by the petitioner in his brief

14

is the comparison between the availability of counsel

15

and the cost of counsel between libel plaintiffs and

16

defendants, pointing out that a contingent fee

17

arrangement is often available to libel plaintiffs.

18

I would disagree.

I would think it is seldom

19

available to libel

20

Court that the use of contingent fee arrangements is one

21

of the strongest deterrents to litigation with no

22

substantial basis because in that situation, a lawyer

cases as presented to him or to her and deciding —

2

protection against frivolous litigation that is

3

substantial and grows out of the same sorts of concerns

4

about costs of litigation that the counsel for

5

petitioner raises.

QUESTION:

And that is a

Do you think it*s desirable that

7

appointed officials for public positions be made aware

8

of even reasonable rumors that are floating around about

9

people that they might be considering for appointment?

10

Is that desirable?

11

MR. EAGLES*

I think it's desirable for

12

government officials who are acting on the basis of seme

13

information to the benefit or detriment of a particular

14

individual, to make that individual aware of it and have

15

an opportunity to respond to it in other areas.

16
17

QUESTION:

Well, that’s not the question I

asked -- what do they do with it.

18

MR. EAGLES:

19

QUESTION*

I’m sorry.
I’m asking initially if you think

20

that as a matter of public policy, it’s desirable that

21

as much information as possible be funneled into

22

appointing authorities, even if it consists only of

23

rum ors.

24
25

MR. EAGLES:

Yes, Your Honor, I think it is in

fact a valuable — can potentially be a valuable service
38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

for someone to mike government officials aware of

2

information of which they cannot themselves be certain.

3

Hr. McDonald, however, did not couch his

4

defamation in those sorts of terms.

5

presented them as true and he, as the briefs point out

6

and it's clear from the letters, cites page and verse,

7

name, address, telephone numbers of people that the

8

federal official was told could substantiate these

9

things.

10

Rather, he

And those people are the very witnesses that

11

we intend to call at trial, are the people through whom

12

we intend to prove the falsity and the maliciousness.

13

But the fact of presenting those names and addresses

14

wins this air that’s repeated by citation to those in

15

petiitoner’s brief of credibility that is very difficult

16

to overcome in a process like this one, where any number

17

of candidates for an office exist, any number of whom

18

have good appropriate qualifications, and as to one of

19

whom this mess is presented, this series of allegations,

20

this possible problem.

21

And the effect of that is potentially

22

devastating to a candidate who would be considered

23

equally among others, and could do away with any

24

possibility or any perceived need for checking the

25

reliability and the truth or falsity by the federal

official who had available to him other qualified

2

reasonable candidates to choose among.

3

The potential of

the FBI doing an

4

investigation that counsel for petitioner discussed

5

clearly existed, except that there is no way to know if

6

the FBI chose to or not, and even if it had, the

7

allegations of that process would not necessarily result

8

in Mr. Smith having an opportunity to present his side

9

of the story.

10

In fact, that argument, it seems to me, raises

11

the government's investigatory process to a — it puts

12

it on a higher plane than the truth-seeking processes of

13

the courts in which Mr. Smith seeks to have this

14

question determined, to have the fact of the falsity of

15

the information and the malicious nature of its

16

presentation proven.

The depositions have been

Oh, yes.

about it before any action was brought on Mr. Smith's

24

And that raises another question.

And one of

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

made some comment — in that :ase, the court of West

2

Virginia determined that the petition clause provided an

3

absolute immunity and made that available to the

4

defendant, even though he published a newsletter with

5

the same information and spread it generally in the

6

community.

7

And that is — that would enable someone under

8

that decision to avoid any possible defamation action or

9

discussion of public issues and criticism of public

10

figures, public officials, by simply including whatever

11

he put in the paper or to the public generally,

12

including it also in a petition to the government.

13

that would be, we believe, a remarkable way around the

14

longstanding libel laws of all the states and the

15

decision of New York Times and

16

New York Times stands for.

17

And

this Court's view of what

We believe that an individual's right to

18

protection of his own good name reflects no more than

19

the basic concept of the essential dignity and worth of

20

every human being, and that that concept is at the root

21

of any decent system of ordered liberty.

22

This Court has so said in Gertz, and we

23

believe that if the interest, if that interest is

24

important, it is no less important because it was left

25

to the protection of the state and that it's necessary
42

to make those people who choose to lie maliciously about

2

people and defame them, to be held to answer for their

3

works .

And if there are no further questions from the

Court, we would urge on that basis for the Court to

affirm.

respondent raised the point about public debate.

13

there is no allgation in the complaint that my client,

14

the petitioner, distributed copies of this letter to any

15

member of the public, only to federal officials.

There was a very good reason why he did not

opportunity for public debate.

concerning a decision that was about to be made by the

damage to the reputational interest that the candidate

2

might have in his local home community.

3

on that point, let me simply state that this Court's

4

decisions in Gertz and Monitor and Hutchinson make clear

5

that although reputation is an important interest, the

6

reputationa interest of a candidate for office is

7

greatly diminished because candidates invite scrutiny of

their qualifications and reputation.

that we are not seeking absolute immunity from every
