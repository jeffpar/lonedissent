HR.

FROHNM AY ER i

Thank you, Hr. Chief Justice,

8

and may it please the Court, this case requires close

9

analysis of an extraordinary conclusion of a lower court.

10

The Oregon Court cf Appeals used an extreme

extension of the Miranda Doctrine to suppress a

cuspirating confession of guilt.

confession on the basis of an earler limited admission

which had net been preceded ly Miranda advice which

Yet, at trial, the defendant sought

The trial court expressly found

that the full

confession was voluntary and that it was not tainted by

his earlier limited statement.
This case is before this Court only because

10
11

the Court of Appeals in Oregon accepted defendant's

12

the cry

that a per se rule of exclusion should govern the

13

second

statement and render it invalid because the "cat

14

was out of the bag."
To suppress the confession in this case is not

There is, in fact, no evidence on this record

20

21

of a connection between the two statements.

The Court

22

of Appeals used no legal analysis to establish it, and

23

instead applied a metaphor as a substitute for

24

reasoning.

high cost without deterring police misconduct or

4

HE. FROHHKAYER;

That is correct.

An

5

acknowledgment which is ambiguous in the sense that it

6

could mean that the individual was a witness to, rather

7

than a

participant in the crime.
In any event, it is a far cry from earlier

8

9

cases which this Court has decided in which a later

10

confession is admitted, even though

11

statement is far mere indicative of complicity.

12

For example --

13

QUESTION;

the earlier

What do you think the Oregon Court

14

of Appeals meant when it used the phrase "the cat is out

15

of the bag"?
MR. FROHNHAYER:

16

We think that it simply

17

misapplied the analysis that should apply to these

18

cases.

19

substitute for evidence of causation.

We believe that it used a figure of speech as a

Even having done so, however, it's clear from

20
21

this Court’s decision,

that causation is only one

22

condition under which one suppresses evidence, and one

23

still must have a fruit where deterrence justifies

24

suppression as opposed to admitting highly probative

25

evidence.

The second thing. Justice Rehnguist, is that

2

the Court of Appeals may have believed that this here on

the defendant's waiver, the voluntariness of the

4

waiver.

5

meant,

6

trial court that there was, in fact, no taint, no

7

connection between the two statements, and

8

defendant’s conclusion was fully voluntary.

9

But that conclusion, if that’s what the court
flies in the face of an explicit finding of the

that the

It shows, in short, the worst possible example

10

that we could bring to this Court of a metaphor

11

substituting itself for legal reasoning, suggesting on

12

one hand perhaps the existence of coercion, which is

13

this record doesn’t shew, or suggesting the invalidity

14

of a waiver, or suggesting causation which no record

15

evidence otherwise would demonstrate between the

16

existence of the first limited statement and the

17

second.

18

QUESTION:

General Frchnmayer, may I ask about

19

the voluntariness of the confession after the Miranda

20

warnings were given?

21

I gather the standard of voluntariness is

22

whether he made a knowing waiver of his constitutional

23

right net to speak at all.

24

MR. FROHNMAYER;

25

QUESTION;

That is correct.

New, is there anything to indicate

7

1

that he knew that the first statement would be

2

inadmissible if it were offered in trial?

3

MB.

FROHNKAYEB;

There's nothing tc show that

MR. FRCH8MAYER;

12

QUESTION :

I suppose counsel would have told

13

him, if he had counsel available, that that first

confession is not admissible and now you decide whether

15

you want to confess or not.

16

But he didn't know that,

17

MR. FROHNMAYER;

Fo.

did he?

But his right tc

counsel -- is clearly given to him in the course of the

19

It may not be important or

here?

Didn't the boy's -- the young man's father come

have a talk

23

with him after the first statement?

MR. FROHRMAYER;

Yes.

And,

in fact, it's a

24

very central factor, Justice Burger, because if one is

25

to look, at the circumstances objectively surrounding the

officers.

He had, in essence, a verbal

10

reprimanded him, and that was immediately before he was

11

transferred to the station house by yet another officer

12

who was not present.

13

And,

as Justice Stevens pointed out in his

14

concurring opinion in the Dunaway case, perhaps under

15

these circumstances the fact that one has just visited

16

minister is far more importent in the elicitation of a

17

full confession than is any activity of the police.

18
19
20

Se think that fact is a very central and
important one.
QUESTION;

I gather that the expression "cat

21

out of the bag” is not original with the Court of

22

Appeals to argue?

23

MB. BBOBJMAYEE:

24

QUESTION:

25

No.

Indeed, you're familiar, I guess,

with our Darwin decision back in 391

11

where Justice

a

1

Harlan, if he didn't actually use the expression, did

2

say -- as I recall it in siiriler circumstaces -- that

3

the problem with the second confession is that because

4

cf what he'd said the first time, the accused might

5

think

that he had little to lose by repetition.
And in that circumstance -- I think this was

6

7

Justice Harlan -- that the State has tc bear the burden

8

of proving not only that the later confession was not

Now,

12
13

directly produced by the existence of the

isn't

that’s the "cat cut cf the tag" analysis,

it ?
HE. FPCHMNAYEE:

14

Yes.

I think the patrimony

15

of the "cat out of the bag" is actually a phrase first

16

written by Justice Frankfurter, then adopted by Justice

17

Jackson in Eayer v. United States in about 1947.
QUESTION:

18
19

Yes.

I knew it had a rather

ancient origin.
ME. FROHNMAYER:

20

Interestingly enough., in a

21

contest, it is always Rayer that is cited for the

22

proposition, but what is seldom realized is that the

23

second -- the ultimate confession was found admissible

24

in the

25

Bayer case.
QUESTION:

Nell, wasn't what Justice Harlan

12

1

said in Darwin?

2

it?

3

That was the law at that time, wasn't

MB. FBOHNMAYFRs

Yes, but it doesn't control

And since that goes to the heart of one of

First, because it deals only with the

8

causation factor.

We contend that, in fact, there is no

9

causation in this case and that relates to my response

10

to Justice Burger -- Chief Justice Burger's question

11

about the intervention of the father's anger.

12

But, second, even if there is causation,

that

13

is, a relationship between the first admission and the

14

Darwin case in its progeny dealt with coerced

21

confessions.

22

They dealt with a set of circumstances in which the

23

individual is net free under his own concept of

24

self-determination voluntarily to come forward and waive

25

a Fifth Amendment right.

That is, that the Bayer case and the

They dealt with involuntary confessions.

13

1

That is net and cannot be the case in a

2

situation where the violation is of the prophylactic

3

rules that surround the Miranda case, because in that

4

case it is at best a presumption of police coercion,

5

which it is the purpose of the warnings to dispel.

6

So we understand the meaning of the Payer case

7

to be simply this;

8

confession to be admissible and usable against the

9

defendant, those conditions which gave rise to the

10

11

that in order for the second

illegality must be cured in some form or another.
In the case cf coerced confessions or

12

involuntary confessions, it's not surprising that this

13

Court's previous decisions suggest that the way to cure

14

it is some lapse of time or some distance in

15

circumstances or seme release from custody, because

16

those are the kinds cf situations that would cure an

17

actual atmosphere of duress or coercion.

18

But where, as in this case, the ccnstitutlcnal

19

violation that exists lies in the failure to give the

20

Miranda warnings such as the individual has not been

21

restored to his ability to make an informed decision

22

about waiver, then the cure for the violation, if it

23

exists and if it in fact might have caused the seccrd

24

confession, is the giving of the Miranda warnings and a

25

full and valid waiver after these warnings, because the

14

1

presumption then is that the illegal condition,

MB. FRCHNMAYEF;

15

and he went

ahead

Nell, it is always a

16

possibility that a defendant’s confession can be induced

17

by things which he either knows or may believe that

18

police know about him.
In this case, Elstad clearly

19

the

20

police had an arrest warrant, and were he aware of the

21

law, would have to have understood that from independent

22

evidence, not out cf his mouth, the police possessed

23

sufficient information for probable cause to detain him.
I believe this Court has never required that

24
25

in the

course of securing a valid confession, that the

15

1

defendant must have been in full possession of all

2

knowledge as to what a trial court or an appellate court

3

would later ratify as having been validly admissible

4

items of evidence against that particular defendant.
QUESTION:

5

Well, I guess the He Mann case has

6

some bearing on this discussion, does it net, where even

7

a misunderstanding on the part of the defendant as to

his initial confession did

Yes.

That still would cure the taint,

whether it confused him or net.
KF. FRCENKAYER;

7

Well, in the limited sense,

8

yes.

But this Court has always asked for bright line

9

rules in the Miranda context, and we believe to create

10

another gloss on the Miranda Doctrine which would

11

suggest that in cases where police are in doubt as tc

12

the ad missitility of any evidence with which they

13

confront defendant, that they add another warning

14

saying, and by the way, it may not count -- what we now

15

know — is simply tc create an unadministra tie rule.

16

And for that reason, we believe that the

17

Miranda warning is fully adequate to cure the defect of

18

the failure to give the Miranda warning, such that the

19

second confession is fully allowable.

20

Any further gloss destroys whatever bright

21

line advantages the Miranda rule has fer police agencies

22

around this nation, and we believe destructively and

23

mischievously so.

It was the

"cat out of the tag"

My second point relates, Justice Stevens, to

15
16

what I hope is a more complete answer to your question.

17

That is, that Miranda advice repairs a pure Miranda

18

defect.

19

Fourth

20

trilogy of cases involving Frown v. Illinois and

21

Dunaway; nor does it necessarily cure a case in which

there is actual coercion under the Fifth

23

24

Justice O'Connor was indicating in the colloquy with

25

counsel, a violation of the rule of Miranda.

Miranda advice does net necessarily repair a
Amendment defect, as this Court has held in the

48

Amendment which

1

QUESTION:

That's very helpful.

It really is,

2

because I think perhaps

4

violation is actually a constitutional violation, or is

5

it merely seme kind cf court-made rule that does not

6

7

the case boils down to this

tc that?
And I must confess that if it's not a

8

9

ever had the power to set aside any state conviction on

10

the ground that they didn't follow a rule we thought it

11

would be a good rule.

12

It seems to me, analytically, it must be a

13

constitutional violaticn or else we have nc business in

14

3

But if you say, as Justice O'Connor suggests#

4

that it's really not a constitutional violation, it's

5

kind of a second-class wrong, then there's integrity in

6

your argument.

7

NR. FROHNKAYER:

Well, I think,

respectfilly,

8

there's integrity in either case because even before the

9

Miranda violation was -- the Miranda doctrine was

10

violated, this Court examined a number cf cases in which

11

there had been an earlier coerced confession in which a

12

cure had been effected by removal of the defendant from

13

time or place which caused the recreation of the

14

voluntary condition for the confession.

15

Here, where the violation is at least at the

16

outer periphery of the Fifth Amendment, if it's there at

17

all, as opposed to ycur rule, compliance with the rule

18

restores that element cf voluntariness and destroys the

19

presumption of station house coercion which the rule was

20

meant to prevent.

21
22
23

And that's the thrust cf cur argument,

and I

believe responsive to your question.
The final point is simply this:

And that

is,

24

that my colleague from the Public Defender's Office has

25

mentioned the issue cf deterrence.

50

And if one turns

1

that question on its head and looks to what is being

2

deterred, if this second, valid, voluntary,

3

confession is excluded, it's far more damaging than any

4

pelice conduct that might otherwise be deterred by

5

throwing out everything.
