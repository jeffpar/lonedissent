ORAL. ARGUMENT OF SUSAN V. BOLEYN, ESQ.

ON FEHAIF OF THE PETITIONER

7

NS. BOLEYNi

Mr.

Chief Justice, may it please

8

the Court, there are two major points that are the

9

question for the Court's resolution in this case, and

10

I'd like to hriefly outline these points before going

11

back and addressing them in more detail for the Court's

12

con sid erat ion .
The State of Georgia originally sought a

13
14

petition for writ of certiorari in this case because of

15

our great concern about the rairificatiens of the holding

16

of the

17

about the Sandstroir violation that it found in this case

18

and the application of the reasonable juror test in

19

Sandstrom to state court instructions, especially in the

20

context of a federal habeas corpus case.

21

Eleventh Circuit in connection with its finding

As we stated in our brief to the Court, we

22

contend that the Eleventh Circuit both misinterpreted

23

and misapplied the holding of the Supreme Court in

24

Sandstrom v. Montana and specifically unnecessarily

25

broadened the reasonable juror test set forth by the

6

The second point that we wish to discuss this

7

morning is our contention that the Eleventh Circuit

8

properly considered whether or not harmless error rule

9

would prohibit the granting of the writ of habeas corpus

10

in this case, but then improperly decided

11

harmless error rule under the facts of this case did net

12

prohibit the granting of the writ of habeas corpus.

13

It's our contention

that the

that harmless error world

14

have prohibited the granting of the writ, as it's cur

15

contention that there was overwhelming evidence of the

16

Respondent’s guilt of murder, and that his defense to

17

the charges was, in fact, frivolous if the facts of the

18

case are examined.

19

The validity of the holding in Francis v.

20

Franklin is important to us for several reasons.

21

of all, at the time that Nr. Franklin was tried,

22

charge that is the subject of the Court's review today

23

was a standard charge utilized by many of the state

Of course, he tried tc harm them and, in

erroneous language.

2

is consider the charge as a whole in determining the

3

effect that any presumption might have, instead of

4

focusing on specific phraseology and determining that

5

these magic words, if you will, require that habeas

6

corpus relief should be granted.

7

But essentially what they must do

If the charge in this case is viewed as a

8

whole,

9

inferences and with cautions to the jury about their

10
11

the charge itself is replete with permissive

duties and their fact-finding abilities.
Of course, there’s the basic constitutional

12

framework present in the instructions in this case

13

because we have, of course, repeated instructions cn the

14

presumption of innocence, on reasonable doubt, and cn

15

the burden upon the State tc prove each and every

16

essential element of the crime.

17

QUESTION:

Well, assume we lock over the

18

entire set of instructions and conclude that a

19

reasonable juror could have believed that all the

20

prosecution would have tc prove in light of these

21

instructions was that he pulled the trigger?

What we're tryirg

Sc the Court cf Appeals applied the

10

MS. BCLEYN;

13

mandatory, and therefore a federal habeas corpus relief

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

And what they did was# they said had the

2

constitutional error been cured -- and what we're saying

3

is they reed tc consider the whole charge before they

4

determine whether, in effect, there's been

5

unconstitutional error; not deciding that there's

6

constitutional error and then seeing if it's cured by

7

some other language in the charge.

8
9

Our position is that the charge as a whole
neutralized any potentially mandatory effect that any

10

portions of the charge, considered by themselves, might

11

have.

12

As I've said, one cf the mcst important parts

13

of the charge is the clear instruction to the jury that

14

the burden was not on the Defendant to prove anything,

15

and that the burden was on

16

every essential element of the crime of murder.

17

Hs. Bcleyn, when we talk about the

18

reasonable juror test, do you think of that as yielding

19

only one result in a given case, or do you think it

20

could

yield several different results?
Let me explain a minute' what I mean.

21

Cc you

22

think

23

have understood these instructions, do you think that

24

only one answer is permissible, that a reasonable juror

25

either

that -- when you say how would a reasonable juror

would have understood them as permissive or would

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

have understood them as mandatory?

2

Cr dc you think an answer is possible, well,

3

reasonable juror might have understood them as

4

permissive cr might have understood them as mandatory;

5

that either one would be reasonable?

6

MS. PGLEYN ;

I think that in reviewing this

7

case, there is no question but that the application cf

8

the reasonable juror test would compel the conclusion

9

that it was not mandatory.

10

I think that when you have conflicting

11

presumptions, say, in another case, the reviewing court

12

might have difficulty in determining hew a reasonable

13

juror would resolve the conflicts.

14

T don't think that is present in this case.

15

So essentially, of course, it's still a case-by-case

16

application of the reasonable juror standard.

17

think if it's not clear that a reasonable juror would

18

find it to be permissive,

Now,

What do you say about that?
MS. ECLEYN;

I suppose my answer tc that,

17

Your Honor, is that this Ccurt has held that it's the

18

possibility that the presumption influenced the verdict

19

that the Court’s examining when it applies the

20

reasonable juror test.

21

And, of course, if the charge is sc permissive

Now, would you think that one reasonable

MS. BOLEYN;

I guess. Your Honor, since you

7

have to have unanimous verdict in Georgia, of course,

8

that the possibility that one might have interpreted

9

still wouldn’t invalidate it unconstitutionally,

though;

10

that what you’re doing is -- of course, we can’t go back

11

and determine how many of the jurors thought -- tut what

12

you’re doing is, under these instructions, eliminating

13

the possibility or making it sc small that any

14

reasonable juror would find it to be permissive.

MS. EOLEYN;

Nell, Ycur Honor, I think what

happened is, then they considered on virtually the same

language in the Corn case and three other judges of the

25

I believe, as I've said in this particular

22

charge, the malice instruction was very significant and,

23

of course, the challenged instruction itself was

24

distinguishable frcrr that reviewed ty the court in

25

Sandstrom, in that the jury was specifically told as
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

soon as the presumption was given, that the presumption
was rebuttable and that a person will net be presumed tc
act with criminal intention.
The jurors were told that they should say,
after consideration of all the facts and circumstances,
whether reasonable doubt existed and that they should be
concerned that the verdict — and I believe the words
the judge used, "speaks the truth of the case on the
facts as you find them."
He told the jurors that malice must exist
before the alleged homocide could be murder, and he told
the jurors that the Defendant contended, by his not
guilty plea, that the material elements of the offense
had not teen proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and that
the homocide was an accident.
Apparently, what the Eleventh Circuit seems to
be doing in its decision in Franklin is compelling,
through its habeas corpus powers, specific language in
trial courts’ instructions to the jury on intent, as it
did with the case law to its federal trial courts in its
supervisory capacity.
Essentially, our intention is that the federal
habeas corpus courts are trying tc oversimplify the
reasonable juror test.

They want tc lock for magic

a mandatory instruction and that habeas corpus relief

2

should be granted.

3

And our basic contention is that before the

conclusion is made as tc the effect of the charge, and

5

whether it’s permissive, mandatory, or burden shifting,

6

that the trial court’s charge as a whole must be

7

reviewed, as well as the circumstances of the case,

including the offense that he’s charged with, as

9

essential elements, the defenses that the Fespcndent

brings up and the strength of the evidence.

11

Cf course, we contend that if the reasonable

12

juror test was properly applied in this case, that no

habeas corpus relief would have been granted by the

court.

capable of looking carefully at the charge as a whole

and deciding whether a reasonable juror could hav'e teen

reasonable jurors could view the charge in different

that the facts that you must look at it is that if

sliahtly different from, I believe, the hypothetical,

because in the hypothetical Justice White posed, at

be enough to respond to it.

If the jury had been told that any evidence

out the other way.

of knowing which of these two conflicting charges they

had followed, and under Strcmberg v. California, as well

21

uncons titutional.

22

But, in fact, as the Eleventh Circuit

23

carefully pointed out, they could have made them

24

consistent because what makes intent criminal in a

25

malice murder case is that it be without mitigation,

2

realized that they cculd use the mandatory presumption

in order to find the intent to kill, and then they would

4

not be allowed to presume the absence of mitigation,

5

justification, or excuse.

And they might well have

6

We have talked about the fact that here the

7

charge said that the burden of proof was on the State

8

and no burden on the Defendant to prove anything, but

9

that is similar to the charge in Sandstrom; that the

10

State had the burden of proof, and that the — to prove

11

that the Defendant killed purposely or knowingly.

12

do not eliminate the danger that the jury could use the

13

presumption as a means by which the State satisfied the

burden of proof unless the Defendant presented

15

considerably more than some evidence in rebuttal.

Finally,

As I’ve mentioned, this accident charge

actually increased the danger that the jury would

misfortune or accident where it satisfactorily
appears
✓

15

there was no criminal scheme or undertaking cr intention

16

or criminal negligence.

17

Under this instruction, the only way to find

18

someone not guilty where the Defendant contends that

19

there was an accident, is if it satisfactorily appears

20

that that there was no intention.

21

A reasonable juror could easily construe this

22

as effectively putting cn the Defendant the burden cf

23

persuasion, of disproving intention, because who else

24

but the Defendant would want tc make it satisfactorily

25

appear that there was no intention?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

would want to make that satisfactorily appear.

2

And the language "appear that there be nc

3

intention” seems to require an affirmative finding cf no

4

intention, not that the prosecutor failed to prove

5

intention beyond a reasonable doubt.

6

And thus,

I would submit that when the charge

as a whole is considered, the danger does remain that a

reasonable juror could have construed the presumption

here as requiring rebuttal by considerably more than

jury may actually have applied in this case would have

18

required the defense counsel, or could have required the

19

defense counsel to demonstrate the absence of intent by

20

a preponderance of the evidence, and it is for that very

21

reason

22

the point is maybe I haven't persuaded

a preponderance of the evidence, but that’s the

that this charge is unconstitutional.
Now, it is possible that in a retrial, if the

23

jury is properly charged or the issue of intent, maybe

24

he will be found guilty again.

25

this Defendant has.

But that's the right

He has the right, under the United

States Constitution, tc be -- if he is found guilty cf

2

malice murder, he has the right to have had that trial

3

done in conformance with due process, with a properly

4

charged jury.

5

And that is why we believe that even under the

6

dissents test in Connecticut v. Johnson, that this was

7

not a harmless error.

8

plurality test in Connecticut v. Johnson does have

9

application here, and should be applied here because

Now, we do believe that the

10

this is not a case in which the Defendant did not have

11

any evidence on his side and didn't have the matter in

12

issue.

13

And therefore, to rule in — using the dissent

14

test in this case, would be to have this Court

15

substitute itself for the jury.

16

would urge that it net be dene, but again, even under

17

that test, we submit that that’s standard could net be

18

met because a reasonable juror, properly instructed,

19

might have found a reasonable doubt.

20

Thank you very much.

reiterate for the Court's consideration that in

2

considering both whether or not there was an initial

3

Sandstrom violation and in considering the harmless

4

error issue, that cur view cf the evidence is that it

5

overwhelmingly showed the Respondent’s intent to kill

6

and that the true argument of defense counsel in his

7

behalf was that he did not intend to kill anybody when

8

he went to the house; that the purpose in going to the

9

house of Hr. Collie was because there were three cars

10

sitting in the yard, and he thought he could get a set

11

of car keys to these cars at gunpoint and by cocking the

12

gun and frightening these people.

13

Sc cur view cf the evidence is that it

14

overwhelmingly establishes all of the essential elements

15

of murder in the case.

16

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:
