ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALVIN D. HOOPER, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. HOOPER:

8
9
10

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Appellant Alvin Hooper has been permanently

11

denied a veterans property tax exemption which is given

12

to other similarly situated veterans in New Mexico solely

13

because he did not establish residence in that state prior

14

to May 8, 1976.

15

denial by the Appellee Assessor denies his constitutional

16

rights of state citizenship, equal protection, and his

17

fundamental right of interstate migration.

18

The issue in this case is whether that

The Court of Appeals from New Mexico held that

19

the denial by the Assessor did not violate those rights

20

and the Supreme Court of New Mexico refused to review that

21

decision and the case is now before this Court on appeal.

22

The facts of the case can be briefly stated.

23

New Mexico Constitution authorizes a veteran's property

24

tax exemption in the amount of $2,000 and that exemption

25

is implemented through New Mexico Statute 737-5, which
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

is the statute involved in this case.
In order to quality for the exemption, the statute

2
3

requires that the Claimant actually be a veteran.

4

that the veteran be a bona fide resident at the time of

5

claiming the exemption, and, thirdly, that the veteran had

6

served on active duty for 90 days during a period of armed

7

conflict.
There is no question about Appellant Hooper

8
9
10

Secondly,

meeting those qualifications and those are not an issue
in this case.

11

However, this statute goes on to add another

12

durational type residential requirement which requires that

13

a Vietnam-era veteran claiming the exemption must have been

14

a resident of the state prior to May 8, 1976 in order to

15

qualify for the exemption.

16

additional residency requirement that is in issue in this

17

case.

18

And, it is the validity of this

The Appellants believe this case is controlled

19

by Zobel v. Williams and under that case the residency

20

requirement is invalid.

21

QUESTION:

I take it the law doesn't require that

22

the person be a resident of New Mexico at some point during

23

his service.

24
25

MR. HOOPER:

No, Your Honor, and that is one of

the main reasons I contend this statute has no -- the
4

(202) 628-9300

1

residency requirement has not rational basis.

2

no coincidence of military service and residence required.

3
4

There is

Like Zobel, this case involves permanent and
retrospective classifications of residents in which the

5

newer arriving residents are never able to achieve equality

6

with the earlier arriving residents.

Now, only two alleged purposes have been set forth
by the state and by the Assessor which were accepted by
the Court below as purposes for this statute.

One of those

purposes is to express gratitude and to reward New Mexico's
veterans and to ease their return to civilian life at the
end of their military service.
However, this statute has a problem in that regard.
If New Mexico's intent was to reward veterans who were resident 3
at the time the exemption was given, then they have failed
to do that.

The statute is under-inclusive because it did

not include bona fide resident veterans such as Appellant
and all other residents who had moved to the state since
May 8, 1976.
QUESTION:

Mr. Hooper, in your view, would the

statute be valid if it were limited in granting the
exemption only to veterans who were inducted while they
were living in New Mexico and returned or discharged to
New Mexico?
MR. HOOPER:

That is certainly a very substantial
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

factor which is not present in this case.

2
3

QUESTION:

However --

Would it be valid though in your view

if it were so limited?

4

MR. HOOPER:

I do not believe it would be for

5

this reason.

6

national interest and a veteran has served New Mexico whether

7

or not he entered the service from New Mexico.

8
9

Service in the military is really in the

QUESTION:

Well, there were a couple of cases,

weren't there, from New York which had to do with a statute

10

much like that and I guess this Court affirmed at least

11

one of those cases.

12

13

MR. HOOPER:

This Court summarily affirmed one

of those --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. HOOPER:

And, you think that was wrong then?
I believe that distinction is wrong

16

because really all that boils down to is the fact that the

17

veteran is being rewarded for prior residency, not for prior

18

service, because I served New Mexico equally even though

19

I was not a resident at the time of the military service.

20

A person that enters service does that because of a national

21

interest and serves any state equally and I --

22

QUESTION:

Do you think it is not a legitimate

23

purpose for a state to be concerned about the dislocation

24

that the draft into military service imposes on those

25

drafted?
6

MR. HOOPER:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. HOOPER:

I think it is.
From within their state?
I think it most certainly is for

4

those resident at the time.

5

statute does not require that kind of coincidence, so

6

that issue --

7

QUESTION:

But, once again, I say this

Well, yes, except you were telling

8

me that you think even one drafted differently may also

9

be invalid.

10

MR. HOOPER:

That is right.

And, the question

11

presented by the Assessor in their brief, in fact, relies

12

on that and indicates the fundamental misunderstanding of

13

this statute because it is based entirely on a coincidence

14

of miliarty service and residency which is not required

15

by this statute.

'

16

The other --

17

QUESTION:

18
19

20
21

22
23

Mr. Hooper, are you a resident of New

Mexico now?
MR. HOOPER:

Yes, Your Honor, I have been a resident

since August of '81.
QUESTION:

I notice you had your certificate here

issued to you as of North Carolina.
MR. HOOPER:

I have moved around so much I am

24

admitted in a number of states and North Carolina just

25

happens to be my home state and that was the reason I
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

requested admission from North Carolina.

2

of the North Carolina Bar as well.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. HOOPER:

I am still a member

But this is within the year.
Yes, Your Honor.

I believe admission

5

only requires that you be a member of any highest -- the

6

court of any --

7

QUESTION:

I am not making any question about

8

that.

9

as though you were of North Carolina.

I am just curious that you had your certificate issued

10
11
12

MR. HOOPER:
to a Bar.

It only requires you to be admitted

You don't have to be admitted to the Bar -QUESTION:

It has nothing to do with a Bar.

It

13

has — The inquiry is how do you want your certificate issued,

14

so it is issued to you of North Carolina.

15

MR. HOOPER:

Well, that is not based on legal

16

residency though.

17

being where I want the certificate to show I was admitted

18

is the way I believe that is interpreted.

I interpret that requirement as only

19

The second —

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Hooper, may I inquire also, how

21

much in terms of dollars in Bernalillo County in 1983 would

22

the $2,000 property exemption have been worth?

23

we talking about in dollars?

24
25

MR. HOOPER:

What are

It would be somewhere between $100

and $200 annually is what we are talking about, but I believe
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

this involves a fundamental principle and dollar value cannot

2

be attached to it.
However, I would remind the Court that in the

3
4

Zobel case the dividend involved there was a very nominal

5

dollar amount but yet five concurring Justices in that case

6

indicated that that scheme, even though it involved a nominal

7

amount of money, clearly impacted the right to travel even

8

though that issue did not have to be addressed in that case.

9
10

QUESTION:

here, Mr. Hooper, your right to travel?

11
12

MR. HOOPER:

I believe this classification will

not pass the rational basis test, however —

13
14

Is that what you claim is violated

QUESTION:

Well, I asked you, what constitutional

right is it that you claim was violated?

15

MR. HOOPER:

My constitutional right to be treated

16

equally with other citizen residents of the State of New

17

Mexico.

18
19

20

QUESTION:

Well then it is not a right to travel,

it is equal protection?
MR. HOOPER:

It is both, Your Honor.

It is equal

21

protection and also a right to travel.

22

Now the right to travel has been analyzed in equal protection

23

terms but both aspects are involved in this case.

24
25

QUESTION:

I consider those --

And you think that people are deterred

from moving to New Mexico by the fact that if they are a

Vietnam veteran that they won't get a property tax waiver?
MR. HOOPER:

This Court has specifically ruled

that deterrence is not required, Your Honor.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. HOOPER:

I was asking you a question.
No, I don't believe people are

6

necessarily deterred, but I don't believe — Whether they

7

consider the exemption as part of their decision to move

8

to New Mexico, I don't believe that is --

9

QUESTION:

You say that shouldn't make any difference

10

MR. HOOPER:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

I don't believe it should, Your Honor.
Is there a similar exemption for veterans

of other wars?
MR. HOOPER:

Yes, Your Honor, there is.

In fact,

14

there is an exemption for -- Each one of them has their

15

own specified residency.

16

it is some date in 1934; for the Second World War it is

17

January of '47, I believe; and for the Korean War it is

18

February of '55.

19

of those classifications are suspect under the same --

But, nevertheless, I believe that all

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. HOOPER:

22
23

For the First World War veterans

Have they been challenged?
No, Your Honor, these have never

been challenged in the state court.
QUESTION:

Of course, New Mexico, even if you

24

won, New Mexico could satisfy you by just not giving the

25

break to anybody.
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. HOOPER:

Well, that certainly is one possibility,

2

Your Honor, but I am hoping that the residency requirement

3

will simply be severed from the remainder of the statute

4

and the exemption given to everyone.

5

is my concern, that this statute differentiates improperly

6

between those who were residents before an arbitrary date

7

and those who became residents after that date.

8

The second thing that —

9

QUESTION:

But, certainly that

May I ask before you go on, Mr. Hooper,

10

would your point be exactly the same if instead of a tax

11

exemption they had given a cash bonus?

12
13
14

MR. HOOPER:
Your Honor.

It is essentially the same thing,

In fact --

QUESTION:

So, under your view if they gave a

15

cash bonus limited in time and I move to Arizona I could

16

pick up the bonus?

17

MR. HOOPER:

Well, now the bonus — There is one

18

difference.

19

has a year after year implication.

20
21

22

The bonus is a one-shot kind of deal.

QUESTION:

I understand that.

This

But, your rationale

seems to me would apply to both.
MR. HOOPER:

Well, if it is a one-shot deal for

23

a bonus -- In other words, if in 1983 they had said we are

24

going to give a bonus to people who are resident at this

25

time for 1983, I have no problem with that.

But, this was

11

retrospective.

2

'76 and then it is a continuing lifetime benefit and that

3

is where the problem is.

4

after year impact and it also has a retrospective feature.

5

When it was enacted in 1983, it was differentiating between

6

those veterans who were residents of the state at that time.

7

If it had been enacted prospectively only or enacted in

8

1983 only for 1983, I would assume all who were residents

9

at that time would have gotten it.

10

12

It was enacted in 1983 but went back to

QUESTION:

It has both a long-term, year

How many people qualify for the benefit,

do you know?
MR. HOOPER:

That is not in the record, but it

13

my understanding that there are about 130,000 potentially

14

qualified veterans in the state and only less than half

15

of those actually qualify for the bonus because of these

16

various requirements placed on them.

17

QUESTION:

By the date requirement?

18

MR. HOOPER:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. HOOPER:

21

The second alleged purpose of this statute is

Yes, sir.
Cuts off about half of them?
Yes, Your Honor.

22

to encourage veterans to settle in New Mexico.

23

believe the Assessor himself has even abandoned that

24

argument before this Court, because, as was pointed out

25

in Appellants' brief, that purpose is an impossibility.
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

Well, I

1

It is impossible to enact a reward in 1983 to encourage

2

veterans to settle in New Mexico before 1976.

3

impossible to encourage to do something seven years after

4

a date that is already passed.

It is

We believe that the requirement of residency is

5

6

not rationally related to these alleged purposes of the

7

statute and there are really four basic factors which go

8

into that position.

pointed out, there is no nexus between the veteran and New

The first factor is, as we have briefly

11

12

do with the military service.

The prior residency has absolutely nothing to

13

So, it really boils down to the fact that New

14

Mexico is essentially simply rewarding its veterans for

15

prior residency only and I do not believe under the holdings

16

of this Court that that is a legitimate state purpose.

17

The second factor --

18

QUESTION:

Would it be legitimate in your view

19

to limit the tax exemption to residents of New Mexico at

20

all?

21

MR. HOOPER:

Oh, yes, Your Honor, I certainly

22

believe it is legitimate to limit it that way.

23

fact, the implication in the Assessor's brief seem to be

24

that I was challenging residency requirements per se and

25

also challenging classifications of veterans as opposed

And, in

is conceded that I am a bona fide veteran and I am a bona

additional requirement over and above that.
QUESTION:

That is not the issue here.

It

This is an

Why under — Supposing you were still

6

living in Tuckasegee, North Carolina, and simply owned real

7

property in Bernalillo County?

8

argument that any sort of residency requirement was violative

9

of your equal rights?

10

MR. HOOPER:

Couldn't you then make the

I think the term "residency" as used

11

in there, which is not in issue here, is synomous with domicile

12

You have to physically live there with intent to remain

13

there.

14

QUESTION:

Well, why, under you line of argument,

15

may the state require domicile?

16

MR. HOOPER:

Because I think this Court has clearly

17

held that you can apportion benefits between residents and

18

non-residents and that is not the issue here at all.

QUESTION:

argument, it would defeat that kind of a statute as well.

21

22
23

If you are right on your right-to-travel

MR. HOOPER:

I am not sure that I understand your

comment.
QUESTION:

Well, one of your arguments I thought

24

was to require a different level of scrutiny because this

25

statute violates the right to travel.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. HOOPER:

2

QUESTION:

3

Yes, ma'am.
And, if it were limited just to residents

of any duration you would have the same problem.

4

MR. HOOPER:

5

not pass a rational basis test.

6

should determine that it should pass that test, then it

7

should apply the strict scrutiny test because of the impact

8

on the right to travel.

9

to get to the strict scrutiny test in the same way that

Well, my argument is that it will
However, if this Court

I don't really believe you need

10

you did not get to it in the Zobel case.

11

decided on simply a rational basis ground and I believe

12

that is adequate in this case.

13

Justices indicated in that case, if it had been necessary,

14

the strict scrutiny would have been applied to invalid that

15

statute.

16
17
18

That case was

But, as five concurring

That is my position here.
We have absolutely no quarrel with a residency

requirement per se.
The second factor that I wanted to mention was

19

the retrospective nature of this requirement.

20

it was enacted in 1983, seven years after the date had passed.

21

This is very analogous to the retrospective feature in the

22

Zobel statute which this Court invalidated.

23

As I mentioned,

Now, the Assessor has contended that this

24

residency requirement is somehow tied to enable veterans

25

to make the transition from military life back to civilian

3

it doesn't make sense then to come along and say, well,

4

eight years after the fact we still have a concern about

5

your readjustment to civilian life, therefore, we are going

6

to give you this veteran's exemption.

7

Well, in 1983 when it was enacted they had already

QUESTION:

Well, what if in 1983 the New Mexico

8

Legislature had enacted a statute saying that all Vietnam

veterans who resided in New Mexico at the time of their

11

entering the service shall now get a $2,000 exemption?
MR. HOOPER:

That is essentially the same question

12

that Justice O'Connor, I believe, asked.

13

situation here and certainly residency at the time of enter­

14

ing service, that special nexus between the veteran and

15

the state at that time is a substantial factor.

16

don't believe it is adequate — it is still adequate to

17

be valid, but it is certainly a very substantial factor

18

which is not present in this case.

is bad, certainly that is retrospective.

That is a different

It is retrospective in a sense.

As I say, I don't believe that statute itself would be valid,

may be some rational basis for saying a state has mere

I have no problem with that.

QUESTION:

8

MR. HOOPER:

9

That is certainly much more legitimate

Would you have any claim?
No, Your Honor, I would not, because

I was not a resident at the time.

And, if New Mexico had

10

given a bonus during the war to those who were residents

11

at that time, I would have no claim to that and that is

12

not what I am claiming at all.

13

they are giving an on-going, year-after-year exemption based

14

solely on an arbitrary date of residency which is not tied

15

to anything.

16

I am claiming that here

I believe that classifying similarly situated

17

veterans into permanent classes -- and this is a permanent

18

classification -- people who came after 1976 are forever

19

barred from achieving equality with those who came before.

20

I believe that that kind of classification creates a seniority

21

system of state citizens in which the earlier arriving

22

residents are more worthy or more equal in a sense than

23

those who arrived later.

24
25

I believe this Court's decisions have clearly
indicated that those kinds of seniority systems based on

And by the same rationale, this residency requirement is

unless there has been some discontinuity in the residency

at some place along the line.

This is essentially the same as -- In 1983 when

Even if this Court should agree that this

residency requirement passes the rational basis test, I

22

believe it should go further and subject it to strict scurtiny

23

because of its impact on the fundamental right to travel.

24

The Court has indicated that the fundamental right to travel

25

prohibits a state from putting newer residents at a

disadvantage or otherwise treating them differently from

2

earlier residents.

3

Under that reasoning, it does not appear permissible

4

for New Mexico to penalize those who exercise their funda­

5

mental right to migrate to that state after May 8, 1976.

6

The Court in the Shapiro case indicated that any

7

classification which penalizes that right must be subjected

8

to strict scrutiny and will not survive unless it is found

9

necessary to promote a compelling state interest.

New Mexico

10

clearly has not shown any compelling interest for this

11

classification.

12

for it much less a compelling interest.

In fact, there isn't even a rational basis

13

The Court below seemed to feel that the only kind

14

of right that — the denial of which would create an impact

15

on the fundamental right to travel were those rights which

16

would deter migration if they, in fact, were denied.

17

Court has clearly indicated that actual deterrent is not

18

required in order to create an impact on the fundamental

19

right.

20

very synonmous to the right involved in the Zobel case and

the concurring members of this Court clearly believed that

that was sufficient impact to create an invalid -- That

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

10

ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III, ESQ.

11
12
13
14

Mr. Farr?

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. FARR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether New Mexico,

15

in awarding a modest benefit for service during the Vietnam

16

War, may impose a condition of bona fide residency at the

17

time of the war.

18

In our view, it clearly may.

Now, it is important to understand just how the

19

statute works.

20

Vietnam War, New Mexico has created two classes based upon

21

residency at that time.

In giving a benefit for service during the

22

The first class and one that admittedly is not

23

mathematically exact, consists mainly of persons leaving

24

New Mexico for the war and persons coming back and settling

25

in New Mexico within a year after the war's end.
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

That class

1

New Mexico regards as its citizens at the time of the war

2

and they get a modest reduction in their property valuation.

3

The second class consists of people who left from

4

other states, came back and settled in other states, and

5

had no ties whatsoever to New Mexico at any time during

6

the Vietnam War.

7

other benefits from their home states at the time of the

8

war but they do not qualify for the New Mexico benefit.

9

Now, Appellant's argument depends essentially

That group may have gotten bonuses and

10

on compressing two separate time periods into one.

11

at closely, his claim to the New Mexico benefit says, first,

12

that 20 or so years ago he served during the Vietnam War.

13

Then he says four years ago he came to New Mexico and became

14

a resident and is now a resident of New Mexico.

15

says, he is both a soldier and a resident indistinguishable

16

from other soldiers and residents who get the benefit.

17
18

QUESTION:

Looked

Thus, he

Mr. Farr, what is precisely the purpose

of this tax exemption?

19

MR. FARR:

The tax exemption, I think, has several

20

purposes.

21

wants to reward the people from that state who went into

22

the service and I think that is the purpose.

23
24
25

First of all, I think the state legitimately

QUESTION:

No.

If that is the purpose, this is

kind of a peculiar date to impose, isn't it?
MR. FARR:

That is one of the purposes.
23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

I think

1

2

there are several groups that fall within the class.
QUESTION:

Because it picks up people who were

3

not residents either at the time they were drafted or when

4

they were discharged.

5

MR. FARR:

I think if you look at the class that

6

it does pick up the people who were residents at the time

7

they went in.

8

also picks up people who came back --

9

They certainly fit within the class.

QUESTION:

It

Well, it doesn't if they don't come

10

back to New Mexico and they aren't there today.

11

to come back and be there today.

They have

12

MR. FARR:

That is right.

13

QUESTION:

But, I guess the war ended in what

14
15

date, the Vietnam War?
MR. FARR:

The official date that Congress has

16

given for the end of the Vietnam era is May 7, 1975 which

17

is the date put in this statute in 1981 and then there was

18

an additional year's grace period provided.

19

QUESTION:

Now it is '76.

20

MR. FARR:

That is correct.

21

MR. FARR:

So, it does pick up, however, assuming

22

they are residents now, the people who left from Vietnam

23

and went to the war.

24

and settled in New Mexico during the period of the war which

25

is the time presumably that New Mexico can recognize as

It also picks up anyone who came back

1

one of significant adjustment back to civilian life.

There

2

may not be an exact time period between the two, but I think

3

again generally it serves that.
The person that Appellant keeps relying on who

4
5

is within the class but admittedly doesn't exactly fit these

6

purposes is someone who had to have been in New Mexico long

7

ago.

8

wise, of course, he is within the class we are trying to

9

benefit, then he has to not come back to New Mexico or

He then had to have left before the war started, other­

10

otherwise again he would be withing the class.

11

he does have to come back later and claim the benefit.

12

13
14

But then

I don't think New Mexico has to draft a statute
that knocks him out in order to uphold the rest.
QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, I may have misunderstood

15

the statute, but did I correctly understand you to say that

16

he had to enlist from New Mexico?

17

MR. FARR:

No, no, no, I am sorry.

What I am

18

saying is people who do enlist from New Mexico are within

19

the class benefit.

20

I am saying is that the person that Appellant is talking

21

about who doesn't really fit within this purpose at all

22

but who gets the benefit, in fact, has to do the opposite.

23

He has to have lived in New Mexico before the war, then

24

not enlisted from New Mexico, not come back to New Mexico

25

after the war, but then later come back afterwards.

There is no question about that.

non-residents at the time of the war, I submit that there

QUESTION:

13

Would you see any problem, Mr. Farr,

14

if they had this same kind of a plan in the state from which

15

he moved so that he got a bonus back at the hometown and

16

then got one here?

17

MR. FARR:

No.

In fact, New Mexico is unusually

18

generous in that it is not a state that would deprive a

19

veteran who had moved, for example, before May 7, 1976,

20

of the exemption simply because he received a bonus somewhere

21

else.

MR. FARR:

Well, the fact is though that -- I

think again it depends.

If they satisfy the conditions

10

of this statute -- In other words, if they are within the

11

group that New Mexico rightfully considers its citizens

12

at the time of the war, then it seems to me that they should

be able to get the benefit and New Mexico wants them to

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

struck down a durational residency requirement.

2

Justice O'Connor noted earlier, the Federal District Court

3

in August versus

4

preference to veterans who were New York residents when

5

they entered the service and this Court summarily affirmed

6

that decision.

7

And, as

Bronstein upheld the New York employment

QUESTION:

Of course, this case is a little

8

different because the New Mexico statute doesn't really

9

require that.

10

MR. FARR:

It seems to me that the New Mexico

11

statute is, in fact, more generous than the New York statute

12

at issue in August versus Bronstein and, indeed, more

13

generous than almost any other statute, in fact, perhaps

14

any other statute that does give bonuses or other benefits.

15

New Mexico originally had a statute which — for the Vietnam

16

War which conditioned the benefit on entry into the service

17

from New Mexico.

18

by adding a year in 1983 was to expand that class of

19

beneficiaries so they didn't cut out people who came back

20

and settled during the time of the war.

21

the statute better rather than worse from a constitutional

22

standpoint.

23

What they did in 1981 and then again in

I think that makes

Appellant makes two attacks on the means used

24

by New Mexico to serve its purpose. First he says that the

25

date of May 7, 1976, described by the Court of Appeals as
28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

one year after the final U.S. troop withdrawal, is, in fact --

2

I think that is phrased correctly -- pulled out of thin

3

air and bears no relation to the Vietnam War at all.

4

argument is simply incorrect.

5

of the U.S. Code, Congress has specifically provided in

6

defining those eligible for federal veterans' benefits that

7

the Vietnam era ended on May 7, 1975.

8

the date that New Mexico chose in 1981 when it first enlarged

9

the statute before it added on another year's grace period

10
11

This

In Title 38, Section 101

That date is precisely

in 1983.
Now, Appellant's other argument is even if New

12

Mexico could have declared a benefit for all its resident

13

veterans on May 7, 1976 it could not grant a retroactive

14

benefit to exactly the same class in 1981 or 1983.

15

in my view, this is really Appellant's main argument just

16

stated another way.

17

awarding New Mexico soldiers a benefit on May 7, 1976 because

18

they had particular ties to New Mexico at the time of the

19

war, which is what we submit, that basis does not disappear

20

simply because the war is over.

21

Now,

If there was a rational basis for

For example, if New Mexico had granted a benefit

22

to its veterans on May 7, 1976 on the basis of those special

23

ties, Appellant clearly would not have been able to claim

24

the same benefit simply by showing up five years later.

25

Yet, the basis of the benefit and Appellant's lack of the

necessary ties is exactly the same in 1981 and, in fact,

2

it is exactly the same right now.

This case thus is very, very --

10

constitutionally more infirm.

look at --

QUESTION:

But, particularly if you

What if they had said we are going

MR. FARR:

In one sense I think that the state

15

is entitled to determine how long they think a reasonable

16

readjustment period after a war would be.

17

it has to be precisely the date Congress picks at the end

18

of the war and I think a year is all right.

years might get out toward the edge, but the fact is,

particularly if you look at the conditions in Vietnam —

That is correct.

much longer.

there may be people coming back by May 7, 1976, a year after

I think that is entirely proper.

I think for a state to say we still think

I would also like to point out that if the retroactive part --

QUESTION:

Why should the exemption go on forever?

11

MR. FARR:

In terms of the tax exemption?

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

13

MR. FARR:

I think that is simply a matter of

14
15

how New Mexico chooses to —
QUESTION:

But you were going to say that the

16

readjustment period lasts for a length of time but not forever

17

You would think that when the readjustment period is over

18

so would the tax exemption disappear.

19

MR. FARR:

Well, I certainly don't think

20

New Mexico would be prohibited from ending the tax exemption

21

but I don't think there is any requirement that they have

22

to continue.

23

to me that a state can say rather than to have a period

24

of time where we say, okay, you don't need any more help,

25

we are still thankful for what you did.

If it fits its purposes initially, it seems

help we gave you was useful and we will continue it.
QUESTION:

2

I know, but if you are not basing it

3

on a necessity for readjustment, it seems to me to give

4

a life-long exemption rather exceeds the speed limit.
MR. FARR:

5

I think it is essentially just a matter

6

of state generosity.

I mean, again I think that a state

7

doesn't have to say —

8

QUESTION:

Which it refuses to other people.

9

MR. FARR:

Pardon me?

10

QUESTION:

Which is refuses to other people.

11

MR. FARR:

That is correct, because they are not

12

within the class of people that New Mexico feels had the

13

special ties at the time of what you are getting the benefit

14

for.

15

how you pay out the benefit, what the particular dollar

16

amount is, whether you pay it in a lump sum or pay it out

17

over time, seems to me essentially doesn't change the

18

constitutional picture if the class that is getting it is

19

properly deserving.

That is simply a matter of classification.

20

Exactly

I think they are.

I would like to point out too, as Justice O'Connor

21

was talking about earlier, they did -- New Mexico had a

22

statute in 1976.

23

problem.

24

this, not just generally but to give to Vietnam veterans

25

the same sort of benefit that they had given to the veterans

We are talking about the retroactivity

What they did in 1981 was simply try to expand

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

of every other war.

2

in New Mexico stood on a lesser footing than World War I

3

veterans, World War II veterans and Korean War veterans.

4

So that there effort in 1981 was, in fact, to give the same

5

sort of classification to Vietnam veterans that they had

6

given for other wars.

7

QUESTION:

Up until 1981 the Vietnam veterans

Mr. Farr, if your opponent is right,

8

and I don't say whether he is or not, all that means is --

9

He says they are all unconstitutional and the fact that

10

they follow an unconstitutional pattern after every war

11

doesn't add any force to this one.

12

MR. FARR:

I understand that.

But at least in

13

terms of the retroactivity the point I want to make is that

14

if, in fact, a state is prohibited by the Constitution from

15

going back and adjusting a statute after the event for which --

16

at which the statute is being directed, then it would prevent

17

them from -- Let's say, for example, in an earlier situation

18

they had a perfectly legitimate statute and they simply

19

I would like to point out that in my view this

case is completely different in both time and degree from

Zobel versus Williams.

New Mexico has not decided that

is anything unique about this statute.

though the purpose of simply to reward citizens generally

a period of time doing what is normally expected of citizens,

nothing unusual.

7

that purpose is impermissible, it opens up an endless amount

8

of doors that could lead to real second-class citizenship.

But here I think they are just simply saying this is the

line we are drawing for the end of a particular event that

11

we are rewarding by giving special help for and I think

12

it is a completely different kind of line.

13

Now, I would like to spend just a few minutes

14

on the question of right to travel.

15

that even if the statute if perfectly rational, it still

16

must be struck down because it burdens the right to travel.

17

I think the argument is wrong for several reasons.

18

Appellant has said

First of all, this case doesn't really involve

19

the right to travel in the usual sense.

20

what this case is really about is a bona fide residency

21

requirement at the time of the war.

22

the question of residency at the time of a particular event

23

as opposed to over a length of time, I think the proper

24

focus should be on barriers to residency at the time of

25

the event.

As I have said,

In cases involving

coming to New Mexico during the time of the war.

3

not a situation, for example, where Appellant is saying

4

I was there on May 1, 1976, but there was a requirement

5

that I had to have been there six months before May 6, 1976

6

and, therefore, I haven't gotten the bonus.

simply saying is I came later and, therefore, didn't get

What he is

is normally engaged in.

11

But, even if you look at the situation in 1981

12

when Appellant came or if you look at it now, I still think

13

that there isn't any real burden on the right to travel.

14

This is not a case, for example, where the state has

15

deliberately sought to keep out any particular residents

16

or new residents generally, therefore, for example, it is

17

completely different from Shapiro where there was an

18

impermissible purpose very obvious from the statute to keep

indigents out of the state.

concerns.

23

Nor does it present any concern

There is also no intolerable penalty.

Again,

24

this is not a case where the state is depriving new residents

25

of welfare benefits or medical care or something of that

But, we are talking essentially here about a tax
