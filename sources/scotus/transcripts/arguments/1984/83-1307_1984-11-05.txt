Our position,

20

in brief, is that this case is controlled by Dunn and

that the decision below is flatly inconsistent with both

establishes that an inconsistency in the verdict dees

the Dunn rule also recognizes, in

22

convictions are net to be upset by speculation or

25

the jury's inconsistency.

In this way, Dunn protects

1

the integrity of the jury verdict and ensures that an

2

acquittal based on leniency is not later invoked tc

3

overturn the very conviction that the jury determined tc

4

be appropriate.
In other words, Dunn prevents a defendant from

5

6

isolating the pcrticn cf the verdict favorable tc him

7

and using it to challenge the remaining and unfavorable

8

portion that was simultaneously reached by the very same

9

jury.

10

No one in this case, neither Respondent nor

11

the Ninth Circuit below, takes issue with the general

12

validity of the Dunn rule.

13

that an exception to Dunn should be made here.

14

Hovever, it is contended

In arguing for such an exception, Respondent

15

emphasizes the compound predicate nature of the

16

telephone charges cn which he was convicted;

17

the telephone ccnvinctions, which are the compound

18

offense, rests cn the use cf the telephone tc facilitate

19

another, or predicate,

22

offense.

This factor trovides no basis to depart from

Twc closely related theories have been

suggested; first,

2

not commit the predicate offense.

And, therefore, the Government’s proof of a

This argument is squarely inconsistent with

Moreover, nothing in this argument limited the

Rather, the proof

MR. LEVY;

Absolutely not.

Dunn is the only

To the contrary, as we

indicate, Dunn was neither
