Chief Justice, and may it

the Court, the question presented by this case is

10

neither complex nor novel.

The issue,

simply put, is

11

whether a judgment against a public official in his

12

official capacity runs against the official personally

13

or against the entity for which the official works.
The District Court in this case found that the

14
15

director of the police department in hemphis was liable

16

in his official capacity.

17

concluded -- I think this is maybe best cast as a

18

Th e quest ion of whether a judgment against

12

resclved three times before.
It was first resolved by this Court in

Monell.

In Mcnell, the question was what standard wculd

15

16

and the Court noted that that same standard, the precise

scope of which I think we acree is not entirely clear

official in the official's official capacity.
