MR. FARBER:

No,

I have three arguments why

the DeVargas decision should not be followed.

5

One, it is not an analogous statute of

6

limitations, as the DeVargas decision says that it is.

7

Two, it characterizes 1983 actions in a discriminatory

8

fashion.

9

about the DeVargas decision on certiorari,

Fnd three, and I have thought a great deal
it was a

10

decision that quashed certiorari as being improvidently

MS. FARBERi

And in Sayna School Bus?
Yes, hut I think that they were

3

not the most analogous state statute of limitations to

be applied to 1983 actions.

5

the DeVargas decision on certiorari came to be

6

published, by the way.

7

It is somewhat curious how

On Page 22 of the Joint Appendix, there is an

8

affidavit from Rose Marie Aldereti,

9

Mexico

Supreme Court, in which

she

the clerk of the New
says that the

10

DeVargas decision on certiorari is not to be published,

11

it is not a recorded opinion, and it won't be cited as

12

precedent.

13

After we filed a motion in the District Court

14

attaching that affidavit to a reply to new authority,

15

because the DeVargas decision was decided after we filed

16

our lawsuit, then the decision became published.

17

don't know how that happened, but that is the sequential

18

events leading up to the publishing of the DeVargas

MR. FARBER;

upon the line of cases which this Court has developed in
