resolution today is whether there is any constitutional

impediment to dismissal of a state appeal fcr failure of

I learned about it,

Tour Honor, I

11

learned of this last week for the first time and

Cur position is that the question may be

QUESTIONi

Would it make any difference in

15

your answer if he were to get up today and say my

16

client's no longer interested in the habeas petition?

17

NR. HENRY;

18

QUESTION;

19

It would make a difference frcrr -Or perhaps sc far as I'm concerned

I'm not going to press it.
HP. HENRY;

20

-- the way you, the way you lock

21

at it from his point of view, but I think a what happens

22

should be uniquely within the knowledge of Kr. lucey,

23

and if he were going to go down and say that today,

24

hopefully that position would have been taken long ago

25

rather

than having him come in today.

QUESTION;

1

Well, now, as I understand it, as

2

you said that he has been restored to his civil rights

3

and finished his sentence, and he's been discharged,

4

hasn't

he ?

5

MR. HENRI;

6

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
Hell,

in that circumstance, he

7

might have no further interest in this habeas petition,

8

might he net?
I should perhaps be asking him.

MR. HENRY;

The possibility -But I just wondered if he were to

Well, the only thing that

21

interfered with the state's interest in this case was

22

the federal habeas corpus proceedings, right?

23

MR. HENRY;

24

when that remand --

25

QUESTION;

That was an intervening thing, and

And if we held that the case was

6

1

moot, we would vacate the District Court's judgment, the

2

Court of Appeals and direct the District Court's

3

judgment to be vacated, in which event there would be no

4

threat to the state.

5

QUESTION;

MR. HENRY;

The slate would be wiped clear.
Perhaps net in this particular

burdensome to us.

9

Well, that may be, but

10

nevertheless, the precedential value of the Court of

ME. HENRY;

12

That may be the case, and it was

13

that possibility, Your Honor, which prompted me tc bring

14

in —

15

QUESTION;

Wiping the slate clean would also

leave the Defendant subject to these collateral

consequences .

It would indeed.

That is arguably what could
I could not deny that.
Yes, thank you.
The facts underlying the questions

in a Kentucky Circuit Court, and he was found guilty of

trafficking in LSD and cocaine.

14

error in the trial court.

15

His retained appellate attorney, however, did

16

not comply with the rule regarding statement of appeal,

17

and because of that, the appeal ultimately was dismissed

18

without making a decision on the claim Mr. Lucey

19

raised.

20

courts were unavailing.

His attempts to combat that in the Kentucky

He then went into the District Court with his

21

22

habeas corpus claim that he was deprived of effective

23

assistance of counsel cn appeal.
The Petitioners appealed to the Sixth Circuit

24
25

Court,

and the ultimate result of that is the holding of

8

1

that Court, which is that there is a due process right

2

to effective assistance of appellate counsel on state

3

appeal .
We disagree with that, as we have set out, and

4
5

cur arguirent will be based in two ways, examining what

6

we see as the reality cf the Sixth Amendment, and

7

examining the two lines of cases that I mentioned

8

earlier.

9

would be helpful to briefly examine Sr. Lucey’s brief

10

for what we consider seme important agreements by him

11

with some of our basic positions.

But before doing that, if I may,

ME. HENRY:

I would respond in two ways.

The

practice in Kentucky is that almost all, according to my

9

1

experience and observation, almost all orders of

2

dismissal are brief, ard they are not tc be published,

3

so there are in reality not many opinions in Kentucky

4

discussing any particular aspect relating to that.

5

There are some, but most of them are by unpublished

6

order.

7

Honor,

Lucey has several times stated

18

There are twc difficulties with that, I would

19

submit, and they are that no court has ever agreed with

20

that contention, and I would submit that while some

22

is not.

one of

QUESTIONS

13

As long as you're interrupted, Hr.

14

Henry,

and in somewhat the same vein, the Kentucky

15

Supreme Court has suggested in the Stahl case that the

16

proper remedy when an appeal is denied or dismissed

17

because of counsel's error is for the trial court to

18

have seme new proceeding and allow a new appeal.

19

So it sounds as though the practice in

20

Kentucky under these circumstances might reach the same

21

end result as the Sixth Circuit did. in other words,

22

normally allowing a new appeal when counsel has erred,

23

as here.

24

Is that the practice in Kentucky or not?

25

KB. HENBYj

Your Honor,

The genesis cf this line of cases, if I may

say so, I believe, is the Hammershoy case in Kentucky.

13

That I submit is an equal protection case, and that

14

marked

a change in the Kentucky method cf dealing with

It is an equal protection case, and examination

QUESTION;

6

Mr. Kerry, let me go tack tc

7

England v. Spalding, and this is the Kentucky Court cf

8

Appeals in 1970 which at that time was your state

9

supreme court.

10

You have changed the name since then, I

think.

11

Am I not correct?

12

MR. HENRY;

13

In 1970 cur high court was called

QUESTION;

That is correct, and this is what I

20

am reading, then, from your state’s top court in 1970.

21

We do net consider the failure cf appellants tc specify

22

in their statement of appeal the supplemental judgment

23

entered December 26,

24
25

*67 as being fatal to the appeal.

Now, you do not cite this case,

and I would

like tc know somewhere along the line, either by

13

1

supplemental letter, hew you distinguish that language

2

from the facts of this case.
MR. HENRY;

3

The way I distinguish it, Your

4

Honor -- and I will te pleased to submit a supplemental

5

letter in addition — is that in England v. Spalding the

6

party did in fact file the required statement cf appeal

7

and did in fact, on the facts, put in all the

8

information, as I read the case, with a miner exception

9

which was that supplemental judgment.

And because cf

10

that, as I analyzed the case, it was deemed to have teen

11

complied with.
I have read that case, and my notation in the

12

13

brief is that they did file a statement.

It was almost

14

complete except for that one point.

15

file the statement, and none of that information was in

16

the document.

Here they did net

17

I of course could misunderstand the case, but

18

I have read it, and that is what I*ve indicated at page

19

10 cf

20

Mr. Lucey's brief as the way to distinguish it.
QUESTION:

Of course, there’s another sentence

21

I didn *t read, and that was that the section is designed

22

to assist this Court in processing records, and

23

compliance is net jurisdictional.

24
25

MR. HENRY;

In the sense of trial jurisdiction

and appellate jurisdiction, that is correct.

14

1

Nevertheless, Kentucky has a longstanding policy of

2

strict

4

instance is not jurisdictional, it's just the

rule,

in the trial or in the appellate court.

Whether the Kentucky policy and tradition,

10
11

that is not a determination of exhaustion, strict

12

exhaustion may not be jurisdictional, but it is tc be

13

strictly complied with in a different context, in

14

further support of my answer.

QUESTION i

I suppose the test evidence cf a

question arose, and it still is.

15

Mr. Lucey then

sought discretionary review in our Supreme Court, which

2

is our court of last resort, and that court not only

3

declined the invitation for discretionary review, tut I

4

think the record will indicate. Your Honor, that the

5

action of the Court of Appeals in fact is affirmed, and

6

this too would be an indicate that the Supreme Court

7

wanted to see the rules strictly enforced.

QUESTION:

HR. HENRY:

Hr. Henry.
Yes.

10

QUESTION:

11

There was retained counsel in this case, was

12

Kay I ask you a question?

there not?

13

MR. HENRY;

14

QUESTION:

Yes, indeed, Your Honor.
And I get the impression from I

15

think it was the Hammershoy case that perhaps if it had

16

not been retained counsel but he'd been indigent, that

17

maybe your state courts would have taken a different

18

view of the matter.

19
20
21

Is that true, or do you think the same rule
applies to both?
HR. HENRY:

My understanding, Your Honor, is

22

that our courts insofar as possible try to be in accord

23

with the equal protection pronouncements of this Court.

24

And I go back to Hammershoy.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. HENRY:

Public defender, yes.
My observation and experience is

14

appeals are dismissed regardless of whether counsel is

15

retained or appointed sc long as the rules simply are

16

not followed.

17

attempts tc apply it neutrally, and indeed, they have

18

dismissed appeals where representation was by appointed

19

counsel, and they have dismissed appeal by retained

20

21

The rule is neutral, and the Court

I think the result would have been the same

protection in one way cr another.

MR. HENRY;

Thank you .
Cur Sixth Amendment analysis is

this, our analysis of the so-called right found by the

2

Sixth Circuit to effective assistance of counsel on

Cur best indication is that neither Mr. lucey

4
5

nor the courts below explained the source of the right

6

that they asserted.

7

would arise out of the Sixth Amendment if it exists, and

8

cur reading of the Sixth Amendment in its most literal

9

and explicit sense is that it applies in the trial,

No, Ycur Honor.
It didn't.
Ihe Ccurt of Appeals did net

and we believe one which carnot reasonably be overlooked

18

That is a difficulty,

There is no

We suggested in our brief that the only way tc

1

2

get the Sixth Amendment counsel right under the

3

appellate setting is tc somehow find that appeal ard

4

trial are the same, that appeal is somehow a critical

5

stage.

6

We under our analysis, that cannot be done,

7

under Ross v. Moffitt, for example, because trial and

8

appeal are significantly different.

9

convert a defendant, presumed innocent, into one found

10
11

guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
QUESTIONS

Trial tries tc

On the ether --

I guess the opinion isn't --

12

doesn't really go into it with much clarity, but did the

13

Sixth Circuit opinion not say that it recognized the due

14

process right to the effective assistance?

15
16
17

MR. HENRYi

Yes, Your Honor, it does indeed,

due process right to effective assistance.
QUESTIONS

Yes.

I had rather assumed that was

18

the basis, but it doesn't cite much authority, and it's

19

a little unclear.

20

MR. HENRYs

This Court didn't either.

Neither

21

does Mr. Lucey, and this has been litigated in terms of

22

the Fourteenth Amendment, and if its the Fourteenth

23

Amendment being used as a conduit tc the states, if it

24

isn't in the Sixth Amendment, I would submit that it

25

just does not exist in the Constitution because

19

1

explicitly that amendment refers explicitly to counsel

2

in the fundamental trial arena.
That is a grave difficulty with the opinion of

3
4

the Sixth Circuit, and I would submit a failure of Mr.

5

lucey here cn brief to directly address that troubling

6

reali t y.
Cur due process analysis in its more general

7
8

sense relies on two lines of cases, the McKane, which

9

comes right on up until the present day, and the

MR. RADIGAN;

MR. RADIGAN;

10

That's my position. Your Honor.

I definitely think that this is an issue for Mr. Lucey

that he has interest in, and I also think it is capable

of repetition.

That’s

that it can’t be just capable of repetition with

MR. RADIGAN;

I understand that, Your Honor,

21

but the fact of the matter is that Justice C * Conner

22

raised the question of does not the Stahl decision in

23

1981 eliminate this problem totally for Kentucky, and

24

let me clarify that, if I may.

25

Now, on November

15 of this year I have an

25

argument before the Supreme Court of Kentucky on exactly

2

the issue that is before the Court right new, whether or

3

not there is effective assistance of counsel standard

for counsel on appeal.

apparent language, but the Stall decision was handed

down by the Supreme Court of Kentucky solely because the

1

would give counsel a limited amount of time to cure that

2

error.
And that makes it all the more egregious the

3
4

situation that Mr. Lucey finds himself in today, without

5

ever having the opportunity to raise the challenges to

6

his conviction, to be able, in the words of this Court,

7

to have an attorney marshal arguments for him, to

8

present and organize law, and to present the facts of

9

his conviction to an appellate court for some sort of

10

review.
QUESTION;

11

Well, Mr. Radigan, supposing that

12

Mr. Lucey's counsel’s failure in this case had net teen

13

to file a statement attached to his brief, or whatever

14

it is that was found defective, but supposing instead

15

that the Kentucky statutes provided you are going to

16

challenge a criminal conviction by appeal, you must file

17

a notice of appeal within 3C days, and his counsel

18

simply had not done that, do you say that he is then

19

denied

effective assistance of counsel?

20

MR. RADIGAN;

21

QUESTION :

22
23
24
25

Yes, Your Honor, I do.

Ir ether words, a state may net

have any system regulating the filing of appeals?
MR. RADIGAN;

No, no, and please let me

clarify this.
QUESTION;

When you say no, dees that mean you

27

1

are agreeing with me or you are not agreeing with me?
KF.. RADIGANj

2

I am agreeing with you to the

3

extent that there is a definite need in any type, of

4

case, Ycur Honor, to have, whether we are talking civil

5

or criminal, whether we are talking trial cr appeal,

6

there is a necessity and indeed an absolute necessity tc

7

have some sort of rules of procedure for organizing and

8

for documenting and for proceeding cn any type of a

9

case.

And we concede that fact.

10

What we do have, though, is a question of when

11

an individual is essentially punished because of actions

12

that are not his fault but the fault totally and solely

13

cf his client -- of his attorney.
QUESTION;

14

Well, now, then ycur response tc my

15

question about a 3C day time limit for filing a notice

16

of appeal is that if the attorney didn’t file that, the

17

client

18

of counsel, and so a rule requiring a timely filing cf a

19

notice of appeal in criminal cases, whether federal or

20

state,

21

ipse facto has teen denied effective assistance

is just not worth the paper it is written cr.
MR. RADIGAN;

No, Your Honor, I think there is

22

a difference there because assuming -- let's assume

23

under ycur factual scenario that the client has told his

24

attorney yes, I want tc appeal my conviction.

25

Kentucky, in a criminal case, it is ten days to file

28

In

that notice cf appeal.

this Court said in Barnes v. Jones,

MR. EADIGAN;

I agree with your conclusion,

13

yes, Your Honor, that is very true.

14

assistance of counsel because an attorney who has

15

reasonable training and experience should be able to

16

file in the Commonwealth of Kentucky after his client

17

requests it a notice of appeal within ten days, anc so

18

under those circumstances and with those assumptions,

19

that a reasonable attorney could do that, then indeed it

20

would be ineffective assistance of counsel.

21

QUESTION;

It is ineffective

And so the client gets an appeal at

22

a later date, notwithstanding his attorney's failure to

23

comply with the state statute.

That is correct, Your Honor.

Well, then —

29

QUESTION;

Sc I guess -- go ahead.

QUESTION;

Gc ahead.

QUESTION;

I guess that saying it's

inquiry lecause you then have to say does the

MR. RADIGAN;

I believe that's correct.

You

lack -QUESTION;

Now, could — is it possible that

as long as the state has seme recognized procedure by
virtue of another application after the dismissal cf the
appeal tc get some review or relief or a delayed appeal,
possibly, under those circumstances, is that enough to
meet any due process requirement?

MR. RADIGAN;

I think, Your Honor, if you look

at the Kentucky cases cn these, the Hammershoy case that
was mentioned to you, and the Stahl case in Kentucky,
both of them recognized exactly the scenario you just
presented, and both of those decisions recognizes the
fact that in Stahl, because of overloaded public
defender case, and in Hammershoy, Justice Eehnquist,
because the attorney failed to file the notice of appeal
within ten days, that those situations constituted
ineffective assistance of counsel, and therefore there

30

1

was a procedure to go back and to attempt to reinstate

2

essentially that appeal in the trial court.
QUESTION;

3
4

Yes, well, so -- well, that's my

inquir y.
Now, if what we are looking at is a due

5
6

process argument, car. we say that a defendant has due

7

process so long as the state has some reasonable

8

procedure for instituting a delayed right of appeal in

9

the event of circumstance such as this, and doesn't

10

Kentucky have such a procedure?
ME. RADIGAN;

11

Now it does.

In

1977 and

'78

12

the Kentuck Supreme Court in Cleaver v. Commonwealth had

13

said that when a state appellate court dismisses an

14

appeal, that there was no right to gc back to the trial

15

court to have that appeal reinstated even on grounds of.

16

ineffective assistance of counsel.
QUESTION;

17

Well, do you agree that for a

18

defendant under Mr. lucey's circumstances today in

19

Kentucky there wouldn't be a due process problem because

20

of Kentucky's new procedure?
MR. RADIGANi

21

what you are saying is that if an appellate -- if a

16

merit,

17

contrary to what this Court has said previously in

18

Rodriguez v. United States and lane v. Erown.

then he should be considered and treated exactly like

QUESTION;

7

What the —

Well, are you saying that

8

fundamental fairness under the due process clause

9

carries with it a right to file a frivolous appeal?
MR. RAEIGANi

10

No, Your Honor.

There is net

11

necessarily a right tc a frivolous appeal, tut that is a

12

decision that can only be reached once that appeal

13

reaches an appellate court, whether or not the issues

14

are frivolous or not.
Consider for a moment what we have

15
16

according — and this has been recognized in various

17

circuit courts of federal circuits around the country,

18

specifically, the 8th, 9th and

19

that in circumstances where an individual loses his

20

appeal because of an error of counsel, what we have is

21

the same thing as if the individual had nc attorney at

22

all, and as this Court recognized in United States v.

23

25

21

there's no indication here, as I understand it, that the

because he was indigent.

MR. RADIGANs

That is correct, and the

that you can’t treat an indigent worse than someone with

2

retained counsel or ability to pay the fees, they are

3

not saying there is an absolute standard by which the

4

rights cf people who can pay is to be governed.

5

are simply saying you can't put additional hurdles in

6

the way of someone who is indigent.

Yes, Justice.

You conceded apparently that there

MR. RADIGAN;

17

QUESTION;

18

MR. RADIGAN:

Right, that's correct.

Sc that -Well, but the question therefore

19

is does there exist a due process standard by which this

20

Court or any court in Kentucky has to measure the

21

performance of the appellate counsel.

22

Court did in Anders, in Entsminger, and in the Swenson

23

case was to say indeed there is at least scire sort cf

24

standard, because what they said was that there has to

25

be the opportunity that a privately retained individual

The state simple, as this Court

15

has stated in Collier v. Sullivan, the mere involvement

16

of the state in tha - convict ion of any individual is

17

sufficient to implicate due process implications for

If we have an option that is
