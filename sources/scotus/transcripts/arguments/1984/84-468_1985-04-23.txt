CBAL ARGUMENT CF EAR I LUNA, ESC•

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LUNA;

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it pleese

the Court, this case presents the Questions of whether

10

mentally retarded persons constitute a quasi-suspect

11

class for purposes of equal protection analysis and

12

whether legislation such as City of Cleburne's ordinance

13

in this case must be tested by an intermediate or

14

heightened level of scrutiny.
First,

15

I'd like to discuss the concept of

16

quasi-suspect status in regard to the mentally

17

retarded.

18

suspectness was articulated by this Court in Frontierc

19

v. Richardson.

20

differentiates sex from such non-suspect statuses as

21

intelligence and physical disability and aligns it with

22

recognized suspect criteria is that the sex

23

charaeteriStic frequently bears no relation to the

24

ability to perform or to contribute to society.

25

The primary criteria for determination cf

The Court stated that what

And declining to join and add in sex as a

1

suspect class, the concurring opinion stated that, "It

2

seems tc me that this reaching out to preempt by

3

judicial action a major political decision which is

4

currently in the process of resolution does not reflect

5

appropriate respect for duly prescribed legislative

6

processes."

7

Now, there has been a considerable amount of

8

legislation in the area of the mentally retarded, and it

9

continues to pend before the legislature of both states,

10
11

as well as the Congress of the United States.
In Massachusetts Board of Retirement v.

12

Murgia, in a procurium opinion, this Court held that age

13

was not a suspect class and, in doing so, observed that

14

it had not been subjected tc the unique disabilities cr

15

the basis of stereotyped characteristics not truly

16

indicative of their disabilities.

17

Now, the Third Circuit heeded Frontiero and

18

Murgia in deciding that mentally ill persons were not a

19

suspect class in Doe v. Colautti.

20

retardation differs from the mentally ill, the rationale

21

of the relationship between the actual disability and

22

the stereotyped characterizations is applicable to at

23

least some of the mentally retarded.

24
25

Although mental

Doe v. Colautti formed the basis for the
District Court's opinion in this case.

And although

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

dealing with mentally ill rather than the mentally

2

retarded, the reasoning in that case is directly related

3

and applicable to the case at bar.

4

The Third Circuit in the Doe case stated that

5

although the mentally ill have been victims of

6

stereotypes,

7

reflected tha + many of the mentally ill do have reduced

8

ability for personal relations, for economic activity,

9

and for political choice.

10

the disabilities imposed on them often

New, that cf course is different from seme cf

11

the other suspect classes that the Court has found to be

12

suspect that's not related to the ability to perform and

13

contribute to society.

14

A classification based on mental retardation

15

fails the threshold analysis since, by the very

16

definition, it is sub-average general intellectual

17

functioning existing concurrently with deficits in

18

adaptive behavior.

19

learn, difficulty with abstract thinking, judgment,

20

problem-solvirg, and retention, and includes problems cf

21

social adjustment and economic productivity.

22

It's a problem of reduced ability to

In ether words, the mentally retarded do have

23

a diminished ability to function in society and a

24

diminished productivity.

25

The cases have specifically addressed the
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

suspect or quasi-suspect status for the mentally

2

retarded or the handicapped, which includes, of course,

3

the mentally retarded, and they've been clear and

4

unequivocal,

5

\>e think, in their holdings.

This Court in Youngberg v. Romeo, in dealing

6

with institutionalized mentally retarded persons,

7

explicitly refused to apply a compelling or a

8

substantial test, and applied a professional judgment

9

test to the mentally retarded in that case.

The lower

10

courts had applied the heightened scrutiny test, and

11

this Court set aside that decision and went on the

12

professional basis test, the professional advice test.

13

QUESTION*

Hr. Luna, would you tell us agair

14

what objectives the City has in this particular

15

ordinance as applied to the home for the retarded?

16

MR. LUNA*

Under the police powers of the

17

State that are delegated to the City,

the City has the

18

responsibility of protecting people and seeing to it

19

that they have a safe environment.

20

Therefore, in this case, the City refused a

21

special use permit, mainly for the following reasons.

22
23
24
25

Number one, there were too many people in this
particular house.

They were going to put --

QUESTION*

Sell, you still take the position

that the only purpose is to protect the health and

safety of the residents of the group home.
ME. LUNA:

2
3

Health and safety of the residents

is the only reason --

4

QUESTION;

Nc other purpose?

5

MR. LUNA;

No other purpose.

We in our

6

testimony showed that we had some people in the

7

neighborhood that complained, who objected to it because

8

they were afraid of them; there was no reason shown for

9

t hat .
QUESTION;

10
11

Sc before us today, that's the only

purpose on which you rely?

12

. NR. LUNA;

13

QUESTION;

Right
And the State Attorney General

14

tells us that the State of Texas has preempted that

15

determination, and that under state law, the State will

16

decide on what is a safe environment for the retarded in

17

a group home .

18

NR. LUNA;

The Attorney General --

19

QUESTION;

And how do we deal with that?

20

NR. LUNA;

The Attorney General, we think,

did

21

not take a lock at t'he regulations.

As a matter of

22

fact,

23

will not permit this home to be placed in a city unless

24

that city does have a requirement of a special use

25

permit or other zoning law.

the regulations that the State of Texas puts cut

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

So contrary to what the Attorney General is

1
2

saying in this amicus curiae brief, the facts are -- and

3

it is in evidence here -- the facts are that the State

4

requires them to place these homes only in a city that

5

has a special use permit or ether zoning -QUESTIONi

6

Does the State go ahead and spell

7

out what requirements the city should have in granting

8

the permits?
KB. LUNA:

9

It does net.

10

Now, it does set out some minimum standards

11

that the heme must have before the State will approve

12

it, but it has none as far as the city is concerned.

13

And, of course, in our state, the reason we are going to

14

neighborhood living is because the state standards have

15

been completely too minimum and have fa.iled.
And we are moving people out or attempting

16

tc

17

move them out of the state homes and the state

18

institutions and put them in the communities, but the

19

City of Cleburn says that normal living in Cleburn means

20

safety, living in a way where 13 of them with 2-1/2

incidentally, a city of 20,000 people.

locate this facility in this home across the street from

2

a junior high where the parents are bringing the kids to

3

school and taking them away.
The City, evidence shewed, recommended tc them

4
5

another facility.

They declined to put it in the other

6

facility and khen asked, isn't the only reason you

7

didn't put it in the other facility is because it would

8

cut down your profits, the answer in the record was,
Then, why didn't you?

9

nc.

The answer was, because

10

the project couldn't stand the burden of the additional

11

cost.
Sow, we submit, that it is necessary for their

12
13

to provide a safe environnent and that that is the

14

responsibility of the City tc require that we do have a

15

safe environment for, of all people, mentally retarded

16

people -- and this group of mentally retarded people are

17

people who did not have the skills of independent

18

living.

19

In the Ycungberg case, this Court declined tc

20

institute the compelling or substantial reason and the

21

Court said that it would be unduly burdensome on the

22

State to make that kind of requirement.

23

dismissal of the appeal in Macon Association v.

24

Kacon-Bibb County upheld the determination that the

25

mentally retarded were not a suspect class.

Now, we think that the court in Rodriquez ir

10

its holding actually used some language that applies

11

directly to otr case when the court prescribed the

12

recognition of a class that was large, diverse, and

13

amorphous, the opposite of discrete, insular, minority.

14

That was the type that was envisioned by the court in

15

U.S. v. Carolene Products.

16

A class dealing with illegitimacy is, of

17

course, different because the trait of — the immutable

18

trait is not cne in that case that has anything to do

19

with their ability to produce or to contribute to

20

society, and

21

reco gnized.

22

this Court in Parham v. Hughes in 1979 sc

Now, while mental retardation is immutable,

23

it’s relevant to classification like other immutable

24

characteristics such as blindness.

In Upshur v. Love, a

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

332, the Court held that the visually handicapped were

2

not entitled to suspect status because classifications

3

based on blindness often can be justified by the

4

different abilities of the blind and the sighted.
Hew that,

5

cf course, is the situation with the

6

mentally retarded people because if heightened scrutiny

7

should be applied to legislation involving the mentally

8

retarded, what standard should we apply?

9

retarded with an T.Q. below 70 and a deficit in adaptive

10

behavior are a diverse group within themselves, and they

11

consist of several subgroups.

12

retarded constitute approximately 89 percent of all cf

the mentally retarded persons.

Some of them require no care.

that the person had a deficit in adaptive behavior.
New, unless one had those things, a person

2
3

does not even know who those mentally retarded persons

4

are.

5

Fifth Circuit has held should have heightened scrutiny

6

to all legislation, and if it's only reasonable and

7

rational, it is not sufficient.

Yet, they're tossed in with one group that, the

Under the Fifth Circuit requirement, the

8
9

mentally retarded are placed in a Catch-22 situation.

10

Since their needs are so different,

11

only address these needs by establishing classificaticns

12

based cn mental retardation and provide different

13

benefits for different groups of mentally retarded

14

people.

15

the government car

Yet the classification would fail if it's only

16

reasonable and rational.

Where they're trying to do

17

something for the group, the legislation would fail if

18

it’s only reasonable and rational.

19

Even the case that we are here cn today, those

20

mentally retarded people who were prospective people vie

21

would live in that home could not be there except for

22

the fact that they have been classified as mentally

23

retarded, and it's a federally-funded Medicaid contract

24

with the State of Texas which permits them to be there

because they are being treated differently.

9

think that the Respondents have attempted to say that

10

this ordinance is to keep mentally retarded people cut

11

of Cleburne.

12

I

It does not.

And this record is replete with evidence where

13

the Plaintiffs were -- the Respondents were asked to

apply on property different from this, property that

would comply vith the health and sanitation requirements

Heightened scrutiny is, we think, especially

inappropriate for a zoning ordinance.

A zoning

ordinance is cr.e that, of course, uses classification s

has established a long history, commencing with Village

here was attempting to discriminate,

protective for the people.

The State is not concerned about

I think this is clear.

11

They're concerned about financial strains on the

Medicaid program.

13

that clear.

The preamble to the regulation makes

And the distinction that's drawn between

that the City acted rationally at all.

important that the Court recognize that there is no

to keep that in mind.

11

that is now posited is not its objective.

was to single out mentally retarded people and exclude

QUESTION;

Mr. Hicks, do you still take the

position that the City ordinance violates state law in

requiring a special use permit?

12

MR. HICKS;

Do you mean that it violates the

13

State Mentally Retarded Persons Act, fer instance, or

14

the state constitution?

15

I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.

16

QUESTION;

Well, we had some discussion abcut

17

this before,

and the State has adopted certain

18

requirements for group homes for the retarded.

19

one point, I understood you to take the position that

20

the City ordinance violated that state law by requiring

21

a special use permit for the group home.

22

Is that your position?

23

MR. HICKS;

And at

Well, my argument was that it

24

could not posit as one of its objectives the setting

25

these kinds of standards, because it was precluded from

inconsistent with state law.

3

But I think that is --

4

QUESTION^

Is that ycur position today, that

5

the City may

rot require a special use permit for a

group home for the retarded in the State of Texas?
MR. HICKS;

7

No.

I’m not arguing that -- I’m.

8

sorry, I must be a little confused.

9

that cities cannot require — ever -- special use

10

I'm not arguing

permits for group homes for mentally retarded people.

11

The problem in this case is the distinctions

12

that are drawn in section 8 which -- also, to answer a

13

question Justice White asked previously, is the

14

ordinance -- the part of the ordinance we attack on its

15

f ace.
The distinctions drawn there are the problem.

16
17

Nursing homes, which also are Medicaid-funded by and

18

large, can operate -- a nursing heme could have opened

here without a special use permit.

QUESTION;

Can I city in Texas have health ard

safety requirements for group homes that are more

restrictive than these adopted by the State of Texas?

7

MR. HICKS;

I think not.

this, the primary case that I know of that speaks to

9

this is called City of Brookside Village v.

10

11

Comeau --

C-o-m-e-a-u.
And It says that no local -- local laws are

12

preempted by state laws in terms of licensing in matters

13

like that if they are inconsistent with or in conflict

14

with the state laws.

15

And I think if it set more restrictive

16

standards, it would be in conflict with the state law

17

setting the standards and the state policy set out on

18

the Mentally Retarded Persons Act, which is that

19

mentally retarded people are supposed to be able to live

20

in group homes.

QUESTION;

QUESTIONS

13

When we're talking about special

14

use permits under a typical zoning ordinance, isn't it

15

fairly common for the zoning board when they’re talking

16

about whether you should be granted a special use permit

17

as opposed to a zoning classification,

18

heavily specified in the ordinance, to deal on an ad hoc

19

basis?

20

here, or you haven't quite got a big enough screen

21

between your commercial property and the residential

22

property next door -- without dealing with a code for

issuing cf the special use permit.

Those are set cut in building cedes and

certificates cf occupancy, matters like that, which it's

11

possible to look at them and say okay, we can do that;

12

we can install sprinklers, we can install whatever it

13

takes.

But that wasn't done here.

14

There was no

15

standard set except the standard that nothing's good

16

enough.

17

it's clear why they set it; they didn't want the group

18

home to open.

19

That's the only standard the City set.

And

I want to mention briefly the question of

20

whether heightened scrutiny is appropriate here.

21

don't think that there is a group of citizens in the

22

United States today that has been more stigmatized than

years for what constitutes a group that, when

circumstances that this Court has said in the past, I

15

think over and ever again, that heightened scrutiny is

appropriate because it's in these circumstances that the

QUESTIONS

7

MR. HICKS:

I agree.
Well then, why not?
Well, it seems that the Court has

8

essentially limited strict scrutiny to racial

classifications .

10

think,

In the past it had gone beyond that, I

and it seems to have backed away to some extent.
And racial classifications obviously are the

11

crime situation at which the equal protection clause was

aimed.

Eut it wasn't the only thing.

I think that in some instances also, mentally

will fit certain standards.

that this Court has used in heightened scrutiny, that it

has to be substantially related to important

MR. RICKS:

7

find I think that's the way this

8

Court usually operates on a case-by-case basis.

9

that’s the reason I posited as my first argument -QUESTION;

10

So

Well, if we thought the standard

11

was wrong, we don't agree with you on heightened

12

scrutiny because rational basis applies, why shouldn't

13

we remand it?
MR. HICKS:

14

I don't think you should remand it

15

because the only objective has been left by the City is

16

this one to protect, that they did it to protect

17

mentally retarded people.
And before remanding the case to determine,

18
19

for instance, whether they may, under state lav,

have

20

that as an objective, I think the Court ought to look at

21

the case as it already has -- it's had two arguments --

22

and determine whether that is the objective.
I think the Court has spent a lot of time cr.

23
24

this case.

I think it's an artificial bifurcation of a

25

case that has as the only issue basically the equal
45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

protection clause to say we'll decide that one standard

2

is not applicable and we just will not look at the ether

3

standard right now; we will send it back to the lower

4

courts.
And I don't think it promotes judicial

5
6

economy; it doesn't promote economy for my clients; and

7

it slows the process down.
I think this Court has the record before it

8

9

and has an understanding of the case and is quite

10

capable, as capable of any court at least, of making a

11

decision on the rational basis.
QUESTION;

12

Well, don’t you think a district

13

court would have a better understanding of arguments of

Texas law, the law of preemption, and that sort of

15

thing?

16

ME. HICKS;

No, Your Honor, I don't.

I don't

17

18

you, and that's the inconsistent —

19

QUESTION;

Yes, but a lawyer who has practiced

20

for 20 years in Texas before he or she went on the bench

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

rationale to do these kinds of things.

I don't think

2

it’s accurate in this case, and I don't think any Court

3

would have had to consider as carefully the issues as

4

this Court has, and had them as focused as this Court

5

has had them.

6

I dc think it would be an artificial

7

bifurcation tc send the case back, that it would lend --

8

doing it on that basis, that is, the state preemption

9

argument, would lend undue dignity to the State's

10

insupportable argument that it had as its reason tc

11

protect mentally retarded people.

12

I don't think any fair reading --

13

QUESTION;

14

HR. HICKS;

You mean the City's argument.
I'm sorry.

Yes.

I don't think

15

any fair reading of this record can lead to the

16

conclusion that that was the City's purpose.

17

don't think it's possible to arrive at that conclusion.

18

And so remanding it to determine whether that

I just

19

may be the objective, when it is so clear that it is not

20

the objective, it seems to lend too much dignity to that

21

argument.

22

And that's my basic position, Your Honor.

23

QUESTION;

Mr. Hicks, may I ask you a question

24

along that line?

Supposing we agreed with you that the

25

record demonstrates conclusively that that was not the
47
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

purpose, and you say we shouldn't hypothesize some other

2

purpose.
Say we then reversed and they passed a new

3
4

ordinance and said we didn't think of it before, hut we

5

now realize it would be for the best interests of the

6

people who live in the home to deny the permit.

7

Would then it become constitutional?

8

HR. KICKS*

find there would be a battle, I am sure, over whether

for them to say well, we think that the mentally

2

retarded people need this protection, even if ether

3

somewhat similar people don't need this protection?

4
5

In ether words, their crowding argument, it
seems to me -ME. HICKS;

6

I agree.

I gave up too much in my

response to y cu .

8

just amended the ordinance to say okay, and stuck in a

9

provision saying we're doing this to protect mentally

10

I don't think it’s appropriate if they

retarded people, I still don’t think it would make sense.
I

11

think people in nursing homes, a lot of the

12

elderly people, they are much more likely to need more

13

protection than mentally retarded people in the sense

14

that quite often they aren't ambulatory; all of these

15

people would be ambulatory.

QUESTION;

17

So what if they do?

suspect?

Does that mean that the reason is

Is that all -MR. HICKS;

intention, the exclusionary intention of the zoning

ordinance.

if a new group home were to try to open.

23

And I think again it would, raise a. new case

QUESTION;

Of course, the other answer to the

24

argument is that, well, they shouldn't permit any kind

of -- any of these homes.

MR. HICKS;

Well, T think that would be a

totally different ordinance.

4

use that's now permitted in section 8 of the zoning

5

ordinance and say we're turning them all into special

6

use permit situations, there would be other problems

perhaps with the case, but it wouldn't be particularly
