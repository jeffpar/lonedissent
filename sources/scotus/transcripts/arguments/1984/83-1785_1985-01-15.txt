15

MR. JOHNSON:

I think you have to look back

16

into 1929,

17

concepts like bailment rules there are generally

18

stricter standards of liability than apply to the

19

handling of baggage than there are to persons.

when you do look back

it becomes very clear that they intentionally chose

MR.

Yes, Justice O'Connor, there

is.

Mr. Gianinni, spoke to the Convention just before the

4

vote was taken adopting Articles 17,

In fact, the president of the drafting committee,

three different articles, and he specifically stated,

broke out the

committee "had deemed it would be better to begin by

and

And that was what was done by dividing up the

16

three articles and stating the different conditions for

carrier liability in each of the three situations.

May I ask one question?

Specifically, he says there is an accident if you are

21

flying along and you hit a little rough air and spill

22

some coffee, that that would be an accident.

23

Judge Wallace's position in dissent?

MR. JOHNSON;

I think, Justice Stevens, yes,

24

we probably do, but I think first of all you should

25

realize that in this case I think we are dealing with

11

MR. JOHNSON;

It's difficult, isn’t it, when

12

you get into the middle area, and in fact

13

parties to the Convention have had difficulty with this

14

themselves.

15

pending amendments,

so that if you had a

as I read it.

9

MR. JOHNSON;

That is correct, and I think

10

what you have to focus on is the event outside of the

11

injury

which causes it, and it is that event which

12

should

be unexpected, under the Third Circuit standard,

13

and, I think, consistently with the Convention.

14

QUESTION;

But if you adopt Judge Wallace's

15

view,

16

Is it unexpected to the passenger or unexpected to the

17

seasoned flier?

18

is bright and clear.

how do you know whether something is unexpected?

19

I am still -- I am not sure your line

MR. JOHNSON;

If you look at the event, the

20

two parts of Article 17*s requirement, that there be an

21

accidant and that that accident in turn caused the

22

injury,

23

doesn't make too much difference from whose perspective

24

you lock at it, it is an unexpected event.

25

then I think if you lock at the accident, it

I ask, to whom must it be unexpected,

MR. JOHNSON:

I think if you go back to the

fundamental purposes of the Convention itself, it would

be more likely to be from the carrier’s standpoint, bat

12

I think the primary focus is on the event itself.

I am not

saying you would

have to, but then I think ycur position is different

from Judge Wallace's.

QUESTION:

That is all I am suggesting.
Does the record show here whether

any other passengers suffered any ear problems?

18

MR. JOHNSON:

I am not sure if the certified

record

does, Your Honor, but I believe it may well be

20

stated

by the plaintiffs in opposition to the motion for

21

summary judgment that there were no other complaints, no

22

other problems on the flight.

QUESTION:

Well, if there were,

assume that the plaintiff would make it a

showing that.

Yes, Your Honor, I am sure they

would have, and in fact in responding to our motion for

And yen would think there would be

liability on the carrier for that?

15

MR.

JOHNSON:

Yes, T think that has been

16

fairly

17

the first one to reach that point, and it did find seme

18

basis in actual discussions among the treaty parties for

finding that, the accident liability would extend to

2

I think it is important, though, to come back

3

to the narrow issue presented by this case, and it is

4

whether the respondent's injury in this case was caused

by an accident within the meaning of Article 17, and the

question is whether the everyday normal conduct of an

aircraft, in fact the necessary operation of an aircraft

MR. JOHNSON:

No,

I am saying that there would

problem conceiving of it -- conceivable other cause of

14

MR. JOHNSON;

15

QUESTION;

16

MR. JOHNSON:

No, I don't, Your Honor.

I thought you said that.
I am sorry,

I misspoke.

If it

17

is an injury claim or a death claim, it is subject to

18

Article 17's prerequisite for liability, and the second

19

purpose of this treaty was to establish uniform rules.

20

The Second Circuit in its Benjamins decision has

21

recognized that --

22

QUESTION;

So you are saying that before an

23

airline can ever be liable for anythino there has to be

24

an accident.

QUESTION:

And if there is an accident, it is

then subject to limitation.

3

MR. JOHNSON:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

May I ask, I want to he sure, there

5

is quite a wide difference cf opinion between you and

6

your apponent on the fundamental of the treaty.

7

you are right, that this is not an accident because it

8

is the normal operation of the aircraft, and you are

9

therefore not within Article 17.

10

Assume

Are you saying that aven though this happened

11

to thousands of people in normal operation, it could

12

therefore be proved to be negligence, and

13

suggesting it could, but this I am on a hypothetical,

14

that they would not then be able to sue you in

15

negligence for saying that you normally operate your

16

aircraft in a negligent way even though there are no

17

accidents caused by it?

lam not

18

Couldn't they sue you at common law?

19

MR. JOHNSON:

Your Honor,

I think you are

20

talking about the airline not under the Warsaw

21

Convention --

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. JOHNSON:

24
25

Correct.

not established.

His theory is, if you get outside

HR. JOHNSON;

QUESTION:

5

MR. JOHN SON;

6

QUESTION:

7

10

No,

it is wrong.

So the liability limitation applies

MR. JOHNSON:

The liability limit applies to

claims for injury and death in international air
transportation under the convention.

11
12

That, is correct, is it not?

even if there is no accident, is your view.

9

Yes, Your Honor, and --

QUESTION;
other than Article

13

Other than Article 17, something
17?

MR. JOHNSON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

14

Most of the cases that have said there are remaining

15

state law claims apply to incidents that occurred

16

outside the course of the transportation.

17

convention doesn't apply at all.

18

where an injury occurred on board the flight. It is dead

19

center in the convention, and the convention's own

20

language makes it clear that that is --

QUESTION:

25

Here we have a case

Is-a liable limitation found in

Article 17?

24

The

Article 23,

it is a later article, I

QUESTION;

And that applies even though the

incident is not one described in Article 17?

2

ME. JOHNSON:

Well, in a sense it wouldn't

3

apply because you have to have a direct -- for liability

4

first under the convention's uniform rules before you

5

begin

to consider a limit on liability.

6

I refer the Court to the Benjamin decision in

7

the Second Circuit where they address this issue and

8

also discuss the uniformity aspect, looking to some

legislation outside of this country on the exclusivity
