Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

We will hear arguments

The issue in this case is whether Customs
inspectors who possess a reasonable suspicion that a
traveler at the border is carrying contraband in her
alimentary canal must nevertheless allow that person and
whatever she may be carrying to enter the United States
if she is unwilling to consent to be X-rayed and if the
facts known to the officers do not provide what the
Ninth Circuit calls a clear indication or plain
suggestion; that is, more than reasonable suspicion of
smuggling.
Now, when respondent presented herself to
Customs as part of the process for entering the United
States, examination of her documents and questioning
revealed a number of facts that caused the officers to
suspect her of alimentary canal smuggling.

These

included the following.

Respondent was coming from Colombia, a

2

notorious source country for illicit drugs.

recently made a number of short trips to Miami and Los

4

Angeles.

in the United States, had no hotel reservations.

She was

Finally, when questioned about

10

the purpose of her trip, she said she was coming to buy

11

mechandise for her husband's store in Colombia, which

12

she proposed to do simply by taking a taxicab around to

3

such retail stores as K-Mark and J.C. Penney's and

4

buying goods off the shelf as it were.

5

Now, undestandably suspicious, the examining

6

inspector arranged for a patdown and strip search of

7

respondent which, while disclosing an unusual

8

arrangement of undergarments, provided no direct

9

evidence of alimentary canal smuggling.

20

Respondent was then asked if she would consent

21

to an abdominal X-ray to verify or dispel the

22

suspicions, and while she initially consented, she

23

thereafter withdrew her consent.

24
25

At this point the inspectors requested Customs
Agent Windes permission to seek a court order for the

she was detained in a room at the airport under constant

observation of the Customs officers while awaiting her

flight.

QUESTION:

15

Mr. Frey, your brief I think

suggests that there may have been a flight to Mexico
that was cancelled or something?

13
14

MR. FREY:

There was an effort made to put her

on a LAXA flight which would have involved a connection
in Mexico City, but because she didn't have a visa —

She opted to return to

I'm not -- I don't know that the record

I should make it clear that these instructions

21 i

from the agent that she should be allowed to return were

22

not consistent with Customs policy, and that it is the

23

policy of Customs not to allow such people, if they're

24

reasonably suspected of drug smuggling, to return before

25

that suspicion can be checked out.

QUESTION:

By the time of these inquiries and

2

discussions she was in the jurisdiction of the United

3

States, was she not?

4

MR. FREY:

Well, she had not technically

5

entered the United States.

during the entire time of this incident prior to the --

QUESTION:

She was at the border,

On whose physical territory were

her feet resting?

9

MR. FREY:

It was part of the United States,

10

but for Immigration or Customs purposes she had not, in

11

our view, yet entered.

12

QUESTION:

Not completed an entry.

13

MR. FREY:

But she was in the United States.

QUESTION:

She was within the borders of the

She —

United States.
MR. FREY:

That's correct.

And if she had

18

drugs in her person -- on her, in her body, she was

19

guilty of a criminal offense as well as a civil

20

violation of the Customs laws.

21

In any event, over the next 15 hours or so

22

respondent refused to eat or drink, would not go to the

23

bathroom, and exhibited what the court of appeals

24

majority subsequently described as, and I quote,

25

"symptoms of discomfort suspected to arise out of or at

calls of nature."

7

At this point, based on what was known before
together with respondent's behavior during the period of
detention, it was decided to seek a court order
authorizing medical personnel to conduct an X-ray or
body cavity examination to determine whether respondent

8

was carrying drugs, and a court order was eventually

9

issued.

As appropriate for the defendant and only

she was pregnant.
After the order issued, respondent was taken
to a hospital and there a rectal examination disclosed a
balloon containing cocaine.

She was then arrested, and

over the next few days she excreted 88 balloons
containing more than one-half a kilogram of cocaine.

Respondent moved in district court to suppress

2

the cocaine on the ground that at the time the initial

3

examination and strip search were completed, Customs did

4

not possess a clear indication or plain suggestion of

5

alimentary canal smuggling --

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, is this clear indication

7

or plain indication, is that somewhere between

8

reasonable suspicion and probable cause?

9
10

MR. FREY:

That is how the court of appeals

has described it, as less than probable cause.

11

QUESTION:

So it's a third standard really.

12

MR. FREY:

It's an intermediate level of

13

suspicion in between.

14

Circuit's cases they seem to suggest that certain kinds

15

of evidence are necessary for a clear indication or

16

plain suggestion; that is, not just a wildly implausible

17

story and the various other what you might call profile

18

indicia, but something such as an unusual gait or

19

possession of lubricants or laxatives or other --

didn't they?
MR. FREY:

opinion for the Court in Winston against Lee, they were

25

not referring there to some intermediate level of

MR. FREY:

It did not, and --

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Frey, does any other court to

10
11

your knowledge follow the clear indication standard?
MR. FREY:

No other to my knowledge.

Indeed,

12

the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits have both indicated that

13

for X-ray searches, reasonable suspicion is the standard.

14

QUESTION:

Do you think the same standard

15

should govern in the border detention issues for

16

citizens as should govern the standard for aliens?

17
18

MR. FREY:

Well, we think that what was done

here could permissibly be done either to a citizen or an

19

alien, but we are quite clear that the Fourth Amendment

20

vests no right in aliens to gain admission into the

21

22
23
24
25

country if the statutes and regulations on that subject
bar their admission under particular circumstances.

the basis of the Haitian refugee type approach that
would just let the Attorney General detain an alien

under that kind of an argument.

take it, to decide the case on the basis of a standard

3

that would be equally applicable to citizens; is that

4

right?

5

MR. FREY:

You're asking us, I

That is our initial submission.

6

However, if on the basis of that standard you're unable

7

to agree with our submission, then we are asking you to

8

hold -- it's different from the Haitian case, because

9

we're not talking here about indefinite detention.

10

We're talking here about a limited detention in

11

connection with potential exclusion of the person as an

12

excludable alien, and in this case they would be sent

13

back if there were no evidence or if the matter were not

expeditiously resolved.

This is not a matter of holding

Do you think that the government is

17

required to offer the alternative of an X-ray to someone

18

as a means of avoiding such lengthy detention in these

19

cases?

20

MR. FREY:

Well, if you were dealing with a

21

citizen, you would have to look at the reasonableness of

22

the way in which the government proceeded; and I think a

23

court could conclude that the detention was not

24

reasonable if the X-ray was not offered.

25

standard practice to offer an X-ray and to give the

In fact, I think there's some

preference for an X-ray because it's more -QUESTION:

Do you think that makes it more

reasonable, that the choice is offered?
MR. FREY:

I think it makes it -- I think it

6

would be reasonable anyway.

7

more reasonable, yes.

I think it makes it a lot

8

Now, I was saying that in the district court

9

respondent's argument was that reasonable suspicion is

10
11

not enough.

You need this clear indication or plain

suggestion.

And that since that developed only during

12

the period of detention subsequent to the time of the

13

strip search, that additional information could not be

14

considered, and the ultimate search was a fruit of the

15

illegal detention.

16

The district court denied the suppression

17

motion, finding that the officers had what it called a

18

very substantial suspicion that respondent was smuggling

19

narcotics and that the detention was justified.

20
21

The court of appeals reversed.

Now, it

acknowledged that the officers had a strong suspicion,

22

and I'm quoting, of body smuggling.

23

respondent "possessed almost all of the indicators" used

24

to identify drug couriers.

25

nevertheless, she had to be allowed to enter the country

They said that

But it held that

in the absence of evidence satisfying the higher

2

standard.

3

So as far as the court of appeals was

4

concerned, they didn't have enough evidence^, even though

5

she was an alien, which was not an issue that the court

6

of appeals addressed, they had to just "let her into the

7

country under the Fourth Amendment.

8
9

Now, let me begin the legal discussion by
mentioning a couple of matters that are not in issue

10

here.

11

dispute that at the time the court order was obtained, a

12

valid basis existed for an X-ray or body cavity search,

13

nor do I understand her to dispute that reasonable

14

suspicion would suffice to support an examination of her

15

body wastes.

16

information crucial to support the ultimate search was a

17

product of an illegal detention.

18

First of all, I don't understand respondent to

Her argument rather is solely that

We, on the other hand, do not suggest that an

19

X-ray or a detention of this duration would be

20

permissible away from the border on less than probable

21

cause.

22

23

States.

24
25

This case involves the border.

It does not

So the issue is whether it is reasonable for
Customs to say to a reasonably suspected alimentary

5

6

Amendment prohibits such action even though reasonable

7

suspicion exists.

9

You have

According to

Now, the limited application of the Fourth
Amendment at the border is too well settled to require

case where it said that "Searches made at the border

12

pursuant to the longstanding right of a sovereign to

13

protect itself by stopping and examining persons and

14

property crossing into the country are reasonable simply

15

by virtue of the fact that they occur at the border,

16

should by now require no extended demonstration."

17

The Court had a footnote in Ramsey that

18

suggested that maybe the manner of carrying out a

19

particular search would have to be reasonable under the

20

Fourth Amendment.

21

warrant is required, no probable cause is required for

22

searches at the border.

the Republic, authorizes detentions as we-’1 as seizures

1

Now, the courts of appeals, however, in recent

2

years have developed a doctrine in the particular area

3

of searches of the body of a traveler arriving at the

4

border.

5

are sufficiently intrusive into personal dignity or

6

privacy that they should not be based solely on a random

7

basis or purely subjective suspicion, because they

8

require a reasonable suspicion of smuggling in order to

9

be justified.

10

They have held that certain types of searches

Now, we don't quarrel here with the general

11

proposition that reasonable suspicion is required,

12

because of course we contend and both courts below held

13

that there clearly was reasonable suspicion in this

14

case.

15

additional requirement in the case of X-ray searches,

16

and as here a detention in lieu of an X-ray search, for

17

something more than reasonable suspicion.

18

Our problem is with the Ninth Circuit's

Now, it's important to understand the

19

devastating effect of the Ninth Circuit's rule on the

20

ability of the Customs Service to prevent alimentary

canal smuggling.

22

external signs, unlike what's called body cavity

23

smuggling where there will often be an awkward gait or

24

where a strip search will actually reveal some physical

25

indication of smuggling in the body cavities.

This kind of smuggling gives no

(202) 628-9300

An

1

2

alimentary canal smuggler looks to all outward
appearances perfectly normal.

3
4

So the basis on which Customs can develop a
suspicion has to be the kind of thing that was present

5

here, and the fact of the matter is that because

6

alimentary canal smuggling is so -- it's potentially

7

fatal if these balloons rupture, it is a very dangerous

8

undertaking, and ordinarily the people who are recruited

9

to do it are poor farmers for whom the money is an

10
11
12

3
4

irresitable appeal, and that does make it somewhat
easier to detect them than if you had an American
businessman, let's say, engaging in that kind of
smuggling.
Now, because there are no external signs and

5

because you only have the kind of suspicion that you can

6

develop from questioning and looking at the

7

circumstances of the travel, it is not clear whether we

8

could ever satisfy the Ninth Circuit's requirement of

9

clear indication or plain suggestion in the vast

20
21
22

majority of alimentary canal smuggling cases.

So that

when we have a suspicion based on factors like this,
Customs has the choices of having an X-ray, which will

23

ordinarily reveal the truth of the matter, or examining

24

body wastes.

25

Now, normally people are not forced to have

X-rays.

in the Ninth Circuit subsequent to the cases

2

that required clear indication of X-rays -- and at this

3

time it was the practice of Customs to apply for a court

4

order before doing an X-ray, as the Ninth Circuit had

5

encouraged, and only to do so where they had these

6

additional factors.

7

alternative is to hold the person, and you can't examine

8

the body wastes until they're released; and that is

9

largely in the control of the individual, and therefore,

So if you don't take an X-ray, your

the detention can be, as it was in this case, fairly

11

extended.

12

Now, you will doubtless hear from my friend

13

about the long hours of humiliating discomfort that

14

respondent suffered as a result of the detention in this

15

case, and certainly it was regrettable that that

16

happened.

17

doing and largely a matter within her control.

18

could have agreed to an X-ray, or she could at least

19

have refrained from her heroic efforts that the Ninth

20

Circuit described.

21

But our point is that this was largely her
She

In addition, generic in this detention

22

situation is that the longer the detention goes on, the

23

more the suspicion builds where the person refuses food

24

and drink, refuses to go to the bathroom and so on.

25

during this entire period, obviously the Customs agents

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

So

1

2
3

were becoming increasingly suspicious of respondent and
having an increasing basis for believing that she was an
alimentary canal smuggler.

4
5
6
7
8

So given the limited liberty and privacy
interests that a traveler at the border has, we submit
that it's entirely reasonable under the Fourth Amendment
to require a reasonably suspected alimentary canal
smuggler to make the choice to which respondent was put.

9
10
11
12

3

What is entirely unreasonable, in our view, is
the Ninth Circuit's holding that we had to release such
a person into the country before we were able to
determine whether we were also allowing illegal drugs
into the country at the same time.

4

Now, if I can come back for just a minute to

5

the point that Justice O'Connor asked me about earlier.

6

Whatever you may think about my argument so far in the

7

context of a citizen or even a resident alien seeking to

8

return to his home in the United States, the Ninth

9

Circuit's restriction on the detention of a nonresident

20
21

22

23
24
25

alien at the border is completely untenable, because
such people have greatly reduced rights of both privacy
and liberty at the border in terms of entry into the
country.
Now, there are a number of statutes that you
can look at in defining, because after all, what we are

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

talking about here is balancing the governmental

2

regulatory interest against the expectations of privacy

3

and liberty that society accords people in the border

4

context.

5

on a visitor's visa, the expectations are greatly

6

reduced.

7

every alien who may not appear to the examining officer

8

to be clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to enter shall

9

be detained for further inquiry.

10

And in the border context, for aliens coming

In fact, Section 1225(b) of Title 8 says that

Moreover, such an alien must be excluded from

11

the country if Immigration officials know or have reason

12

to believe that the alien is an illicit trafficker of

13

narcotics.

14

Finally, they pointed out that there are

15

statutes providing for the medical examination of aliens

16

at the border.

17

enacted with this particular exclusion, the 823

18

exclusion for narcotics trafficking, in mind.

Now, I don't think that statute was

19

The point that we are making principally about

20

this complex of statutes is that the Ninth Circuit can't

21

MR. FREY:

Well, as far as I am aware, the

instructions for dealing with the X-ray situation are
contained in manuals that are not published, that are
issued to Customs agents in the various regions.

And,

in fact, these manuals vary in what they instruct the
agents to do depending on the region and the law.

The

manuals are different in the Ninth Circuit from what
they are in the Eleventh Circuit.
QUESTION:

Has there ever been any objection

to the intrusiveness of the X-ray procedure itself other
than the possible risk to a pregnant person?

MR. FREY:

That is what the issue is in this

case.

But the way X-rays come into the case is that in

that in determining the reasonableness of a detention of

the kind that occurred here, you look at the

alternatives that are made available.

7

my brother here will suggest to you that an X-ray is a

8

dose of poison and the fact that people can have X-rays

9

can't help the government's case here.

And, of course,

And I suggest

10

that the fact that X-rays are relatively routine and

11

that I think we know from common experience that most

people prefer them, or many people would prefer them

than to alimentary canal smuggling X-rays.

no published data with regard to the frequency with

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER MARVIN HORSTMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. HORSTMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

please the Court:

2

Petitioner states on page 18 of the petition

3

that the decision below has resulted in application of

4

different rules governing Customs procedures in the

5

Eleventh and Ninth Circuits, and the decision of the

6

Ninth Circuit virtually invites alimentary canal

7

smugglers to shift their operations to the Ninth Circuit

8

where -- now I'm paraphrasing -- the higher clear

9

indication standard basically ties the hands of Customs

10

officers and would invariably cause the release of

11

alimentary canal smugglers into the country.

12

that language the implication would be that this Court

13

needs to overrule that decision in order to quash

14

basically a runaway circuit, which would be the Ninth

15

Circuit in this case, in terms of the clear indication

16

standard.

17

And by

The language and the rhetoric used by

18

petitioner is compelling and even alarming, but we

19

submit that it is simply not true.

20

read the facts and the holdings of the reported cases in

21

both the Ninth, the Fifth and the Eleventh Circuits, a

22

careful and close reading of the facts and holdings of

23

those cases show that the rules applied by the three

24

circuits are exactly the same.

25

And if you carefully

In other words, in the Fifth and Eleventh

6

Circuits those circuits recognize the hierarchy of
intrusiveness in border searches, and a flexible,
reasonable suspicion standard.

So that, for instance, a

body cavity search would require a higher level of
flexible, reasonable suspicion than would a frisk or a
strip search, and —

7

QUESTION:

Then instead of it being an

8

intermediate standard, in your view, Mr. Horstman, it's

9

just really a multitude of standards.
1

10

MR. HORSTMAN:

That's correct.

If you're in

11

the Ninth Circuit and if you look at, for instance, the

12

facts of Mosquera-Ramirez, which petitioner cites as the

13

case that shows why the Ninth Circuit needs to be

14

reversed, if you look at the facts of Mosquera-Ramirez,

15

there is in fact what would have been held to be clear

16

indication in the Ninth Circuit.

17

many Ninth Circuit cases which I cite in footnote 30

18

that have upheld lengthy detentions and X-rays based on

19

clear indication evidence, you'll see the facts in those

20

cases correspond very closely to the Fifth and Eleventh

21

Circuit cases using the flexible, reasonable suspicion

22

If you look at the

standard.
QUESTION:

But reasonable suspicion is at

least something that our Terry cases have talked about
fairly regularly.

The basic import of Simmons is

still valid, Your Honor, and to give you an example of

19

how and why it is, if a policeman comes to Mr. Frey's

20

door without a search warrant and asks Mr. Frey, may I

21

come in and search, and Mr. Frey may freely say no, that

22

police officer may not then use the fact that he

23

declined the officer to come in and search his home as

24
25

further suspicion allowing him to get a warrant, nor may
he use that as exigent circumstances allowing him to

QUESTION:

You don't need Simmons -- you don't

need Simmons for that proposition.

4

MR. HORSTMAN:

But the point is

5

here the government cannot argue that by not consenting

6

to allow an invasion of her Fourth Amendment rights, she

7

therefore consented to the even more intrusive procedure.

QUESTION:

Well, but there is a certain

resemblance to civil contempt here where you have the

10

feeling that the respondent carried the keys in her

11

pocket, so to speak, if she had simply ceased her heroic

12

efforts.

13

MR. HORSTMAN:

Well, Your Honor, the evidence

14

on that last point is extremely ambiguous, and let me

15

give you an example of that.

17

efforts, but just before that language it says their

18

suspicions were that she was using heroic efforts.

23

that you're not carrying anything internally.

25

and it wouldn't be heroic efforts in that case.

MR. HORSTMAN:

It's certainly possible that a

person who is nervous or afraid anyway because they are

6

being confined would be unable to excrete for a lengthy

7

period of time, but that wouldn't necessarily mean

8

evidence of guilt.

9

In any event, we think and we submit to you

10

that the Solicitor General's statements about the Ninth

11

Circuit's additional requirement, and to quote directly,

12

"the devastating effect that the Ninth Circuit clear

I submit to you, Justices, that the government

what they did.

They didn't just put her in a room.

They observed her.

Their intention at that time was to

obtain additional incriminating evidence that would
support a court order -- the very thing that this Court
has held in Dunaway, Davis and Hayes is improper,
because the essence of a police state is to arrest

someone without probable cause, hold them in custody

MR. HORSTMAN:

Well, I'm saying something much

2

more limited than that.

I'm saying that in terms of the

3

government's argument that because it's well known that

4

Immigration regulations sometimes allow detentions and

5

searches and seizures before a person is admitted, her

6

reasonable expectation of privacy was lower.

7

Whatever the merits of that in another case,

8

it has no applicability to the facts of this case,

9

because the reasonable expectation of privacy of an

10

12

alien and a citizen before Customs by virtue of statute
and regulatory authority is equal.

MR. HORSTMAN:

Well, do you agree that there was?
We — our position is that

7

there was no reasonable suspicion to conduct the strip

8

search, the first strip search; that all that they had

9

at that time were vague profile characteristics.

They

were -- they could conduct a routine Customs search and

If we look back at what

Are you aware of any statistics

14

MR. HORSTMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

If you have

my brief, if you'd refer to footnote number 88 for a

16

moment.

17

The statistics, I certainly would concede,

18

have not been done with the conscientiousness that

19

perhaps they could and should have, but if you look at

20

footnote 88, the statistics available at least in the

21

reported cases indicate that innocent persons are swept

22

with alarming regularity into these very intrusive body

23

cavity and strip searches at the border.

24
25

For instance, in the study that was done in
Guadalupe Garzo, only 29 percent of the people at the

don't know of any more recent statistics.

statistics that show that innocent persons are not being

MR. HORSTMAN:

for as being reasonable?

Well, but that really doesn't help

MR. HORSTMAN:

I don't think this Court has to

that the government has to come up to in order to

conduct these searches, but certainly the- other 70

MR. FREY:

21

First, I want to plead not guilty to

22

23

reasonable suspicion otherwise.

24
25

I will agree with Mr. Horstman that the facts
in the Eleventh Circuit cases which we've addressed in

4

our cert oppositions to some of those cases where
petitions were filed were stronger than this case.
Indeed, in our view in most of those cases they amounted
to probable cause.

5

But I think as the questioning of the Court

6

made clear, all Mr. Horstman has really been able to

7

establish is that it's possible that his client was

8

telling the truth and was not an alimentary canal

9

smuggler but a legitimate business traveler.

Obviously,

10

that possibility is not enough to defeat a reasonable

11

suspicion.

12

And with regard to this Customs-Immigration

13

question, there is a general practice of

14

cross-designating Customs and Immigration agents.

15

There's no evidence in the record in this case as to

16

whether or not they were cross-designated.

17

are cross-designated, which is usually true at ports of

18

entry -- I'm talking about the inspectors within the

19

secure area -- they -- Immigration inspectors can

20

perform Customs functions and vice versa.

21

Where they

Now, even if the Customs officer were not

22

cross-designated, however, it's perfectly clear that if

23

he gained information that the person had a forged visa

24
25

or was otherwise ineligible for entry under the
immigration laws, you should have no doubt in your mind

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that he would take the person back to Immigration.

2

Now, in this case what happened and what often

3

happens at the border -- for instance, people swimming

4

across the Rio Grande when they are caught, are normally

5

if they are willing to just turn around and swim back to

6

the other side or be driven back to the other side,

7

there is just an informal allowance of them to leave.

8

Only if they say they want to say would they be subject

9

to a formal exclusion proceeding.

10

Even if, as respondent contends, she had

11

entered the country for immigration purposes after her

12

passport was stamped, however, that would mean nothing

13

more than that under these circumstances there would be

14

a deportation proceeding rather than an exclusion

15

proceeding, and of course, she would be detained for

16

purposes of the deportation proceeding anyway.

17

matter how you slice it, she does not have a right to

18

come in.

So no

The Placensia case deals with resident aliens
