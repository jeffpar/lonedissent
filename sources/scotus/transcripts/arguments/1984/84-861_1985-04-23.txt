Come, I think you may proceed whenever ycc

OS BEHALF OF THE

HR.

CONE*

ESQ.,

PETITIONER

Nr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, this case calls for this Court to

11

review a second time the rules on containers which are a

12

part of collective bargaining agreements between the

13

International longshoremen's Association and shipping

14

industry employers on the Atlantic and Gulf coast.

15

The

rules were adopted in response to a

16

technological innovation in the shipping industry knotin

17

as containerization, which has had an impact on

18

longshoremen's work.

19

containers are large, reusable metal receptacles 20 to

20

40 feet in length and capable of carrying upwards of

21

30,000 pounds cf freight which can be moved on and off

22

an ocean vessel unopened, and they can then be affixed

23

to a truck chassis and transported intact to and from

24

the pier like a trailer.

25

As this Court may recall,

The rules provide in general that if
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

containers owned or leased by the shipping companies are

2

to be unloaded or leaded, stripped or stuffed as that

3

process is called in the industry, within 50 miles of

4

the port by anyone other than the beneficial owner of

5

the cargo, the work must be done at the pier by

6

longsho remen.

7

The rules require shipping companies to deny

8

containers to any facility operating in violation of the

9

rules and to pay liquidated damages of $1,00C per

10

container or fer any container handled in violation cf

11

the rules.

12

Now, at first blush the rules would appear to

13

violate Section 80 of the National Labor Relations Act

14

which prohibits an employer and a union from agreeing

15

that the emplcjer will cease doing business with another

16

person because they require the shipping companies tc

17

deny containers and thus do business with anyone

18

operating in violation cf the rules.

19

But this Court has held that 80 applies only

20

to secondary activity and net tc activity serving a

21

legitimate primary purpose, and among the primary

22

purposes protected by the Act is the purpose of

23

preserving for the contracting employees themselves work

24

traditionally done by them.

25

On the other hand, decisions cf this Court
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

have established that an agreement dees not have a

2

legitimate work preservation objective and is instead

3

for a secondary objective that is unlawful under Section

4

80 if it seeks to acquire for union members work that

5

was not previously theirs.

6

Now, the last time this case was before this

7

Court, what I shall refer to ILfl-1, this Court vacated

8

two decisions cf the NLRE and it concluded that the

9

rules on containers and their enforcement constituted

10

secondary activity proscribed by Section 80 and

11

8(b)(4)(B) of

12

The

the Labor Act.
Court concluded that the board, in finding

13

that the rules in their applications did net serve a

14

valid work preservation objective had applied an

15

erroneous definition of the work in controversy,

16

defining the disputed work as the container work

17

performed by the truckers and consolidators at their

18

off-pier premises after the innovation cf containers,

19

thereby foreclosing the longshoremen from playing any

20

part in the loading or unloading of containerized

21

cargo.

22

The Court accordingly remanded the case to the

23

board to take another look at the rules applying a

24

proper definition of the work, and the Court explained

25

that the — or instructed the board in determining
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMI-ANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

whether the rules had a lawful work preservation object

2

to see whether they were tailored to the objective of

3

preserving the essence of traditional work patterns.

4

In short, the beard was to undertake a careful

5

analysis of the traditional work patterns that the rules

6

were allegedly seeking to preserve and determine whether

7

the historical and functional relationship between this

8

retained work and traditional longshore work could

9

support the conclusion that the objective was work

10
11

preservation rather than work acquisition.
On remand, the beard consolidated the two

12

prior proceedings with seven ether proceedings involving

13

the rules, and after making the analysis which the Court

14

directed it to make of the traditional work patterns,

15

concluded that the rules violated the labor Act in their

16

application to a widespread practice known as

17

shertstepping and to certain traditional warehousing

18

activities.

19

These practices occur in connection with what

20

is termed FSL container loads, containers holding import

21

cargo or export cargo — import cargo destined for only

22

one consignee, and export cargo from only one shipper.

23

The board upheld the application of the rules

24

that were at issue insofar as they applied to less than

25

container loads which are containers holding expert

Court of Appeals, disagreeing with the

4

board in part, held that the rules were lawful in their

5

application to shortstopping and to the warehousing

6

practices that the beard found them to be unlawful, and

7

this is the only aspect of the Court of Appeals decision

8

which is now before this Court.

9

QUESTION*

Rr. Come, is there anything in the

10

beard’s cpinicr stating that loading and unloading

11

before the shortstop by truckers is not traditional

12

longshremen 's work?

13
14

Did you find anything to that effect in the
opinion ?

15

MS. CORE*

Well, what the board did was to

16

affirm the basic findings of the Administrative Law

17

Judge except in two respects, which do not alter his

18

finding that the shortstopping was not functionally

19

related

20

to the work patterns of the meter carriers.

21

to traditional longshore work.

That was related

So, by affirming the Administrative Law

22

Judge’s findings and not rejecting this basic finding

23

with respect tc shortstopping, we submit that the bcarc

24

did approve the Administrative Law Judge's finding.

25

QUESTION*

Do you think that eliminated work,

work that is eliminated because of technological change

2

can ever be preserved by a collective bargaining

3

agreement?

4

KR.

C0f?E;

I think that it may be possible in

5

some circumstances.

6

to face that flat proposition because in this case the

7

eliminated work that was sought to be replaced was in

8

the board’s view and the Administrative law Judge’s view

9

not work that was functionally related to traditional

10

I think that the beard did net have

longshore work .

11

It is an easier case where the employees seek

12

to substitute for the eliminated work work that is not

13

functionally related to what they have been doing, and

14

that is this case.
Now, the hypothetical case that Your Honor is

15
16

positing, as I understand it, is a situation where an

17

effort is made to restore eliminated work that is

18

functionally related to work that had previously been

19

performed .

20

As I say,

the board did not have to come to

21

grips with that issue in this case.

22

upon how one interprets National Woodwork.

23

reading of that case it could lead to the conclusion

24

that you could preserve.

25

QUESTION*

That will depend

Prior to containerization, the cargo would be

It would then be loaded onto local

MR. COKE;

It would be leaded by longshoremen

AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSOCIATIONS, ET AL.,
IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LIPS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

15

please the Court, in a case like this where the primary

16

and secondary objective is found only by looking at

17

whether cr net the bargaining unit is seeking to acquire

18

work as opposed to some other objective, there are cnly

19

two considerations that need be addressed.

20

One is, what is the traditional work, what is

21

the disputed werk in comparison with that work, and

22

where the work is of a different character and kind cr

23

type or any word like that that connotes a change in

24

form, then technically speaking none of that work

25

relates to traditional work because the traditional werk

work may be preserved, but that portion that is

10

purpose or function cannot be preserved, because what I

11

believe the Court said and what we believe this case tc

12

be abcut is that you can't just decide this case by

13

virtue of examining physical skills of handling cargo a

14

piece at a time, because both sides have handled this

15

cargo traditionally for years like that, as Harmat said,

16

from the dawn of time.

17

What we say here is that we are dealing with a

18

new form of work, and because purpose relates to

19

function, then the purpose of this work is related tc

20

motor transportation* at least this portion,

they won’t do it.
So,

cur warehousemen who have hundreds cf

thousands of dollars of warehouses in the piers that

they can’t move beyond the 5C miles are going to dry up

carriers within the 50-mile zones are not going to have

anything to do, because shippers simply will not pay tc

One thing you need to understand factually is,

shortstop work is done at the cost of the motor carrier

11

for his convenience.

MR.

So, getting back to the Chief

7

Justice, really, the contract, the rules on containers

were a tremendous economic benefit to the country.

9

seems expensive ten years later, because now you are

It

10

paying the little residue that we kept, tut the 80

11

percent that we gave up let this intermodal traffic

12

flourish, and it made shipping cheaper, because there

13

are no handlings from the ship all the way to the owner,

14

so that we have accommodated progress.

15

We have done the economic thing.

But then,

16

always on an error of law, for ten years the rules

17

weren't enjoined.

18

ch, gee, we have to pay these longshoremen in this

19

limited instance where they kept the work, but

20

economically speaking, you have to look at the day the

21

contract was made.

22

Now we are looking back and we say,

Now, of course, whether it is economic or not

23

24

The board found that the rules in their

had a work acquisition -- a work preservation

objective .

13

It was in that context that the Administrative

to find, and this is at Page 55A of the appendix, that

is the
