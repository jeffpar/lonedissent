The only time a claimant had to report to the

elected to proceed to patent, that is,

to

host claimants didn't bother to take that
step,

so BLM did net have any information on the status

of these claims, and that situation made it very

10

difficult for the federal land managers to take actions

11

with respect to federal lands.

12

Unless BLK did seme fairly extensive research

13

at the local county courthouse and then tried to track

14

down all of these potential claimants it identified, it

15

simply couldn't be sure one way or the ether about

16

whether the land at issue was encumbered by such claims.

17
18

And that interfered with the ability tc gc
ahead and take action with respect tc a piece of land.

Well, that’s correct.

You are also going to have the people who file

enough ir advance to avoid this tough situation at the

end of the year.

QUESTION;

And you will have the people who

simply mail the notice, the annual notice in on December

MS. CORWIN;

That is correct, although that

particular regulation was net in effect at the time this

10

particular situation came along, but that is the case

11

t o d ay .

12
13

QUESTION;

Ms. Corwin, could Congress

retroactively cure this situation for the Lockes?

MS. CCRWIN;

My understanding is that Congress

could

17

provision which I believe is at 30 USC 188(f) in which

18

it said people who miss the deadline and who have the

19

oil and gas Flaser claims can take certain steps,

20

they will not get their claims back under the general

21

mining laws, but they will be eligible for

22

noncompetitive leases of these oil and gas deposits.

I suppose something equivalent could be dene
here if Congress felt that there was a real problem.
QUESTION;

I take it the government’s reaction

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

to this hardship situation is that people who want to

2

acquire rights in land owned by the government can he

3

required to turn square corners.

4

MS. CORWIN;

Well, I think that’s correct, and

5

certainly we understand that there are these

6

difficulties, and the secretary has attempted to

7

administer the statute in a way that is both consistent

8

with what Congress has said and that accommodates an

9

understanding of the difficulties people face.

10

But I don't think it was unresonable for

11

Congress tc make the judgment that in this particular

12

situation with millions of claims it was appropriate to

13

put the responsibility for communicating intent to

14

retain

15

the claim on federal land on the claimant.
QUESTION;

How do you think you advance your

16

case by saying that it wasn’t unreasonable for Congress

17

to do this?

18

decide whether or net this was a ’’reasonable" statute

19

for Congress tc have passed?

20
21
22
23

Do you think we ought to sit up here and

MS. CCRWIN;

Well, I think the issue here is

the constitutionality of what Congress has dene.
.QUESTION:

I would have thought so, too.

MS. CCRWIN:

That’s correct.

There has been

24

much suggestion, I think, in the briefs that were filed

25

in this case that Congress couldn’t possibly have meant
\

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

to do this, that this is quite an unreasonable result,

2

and my suggestion is that,

3

about turning square corners, it is certainly reasonable

4
5

following your suggestion

to expect that sort of reaction from claimants in this
particular circumstance.

6

QUESTION;

Of course, in that Texaco versus

7

Short decision, there is language in the opinion that

8

speaks of upholding the state law in that case because

9

it imposed reasonable conditions on intention.

10

NS. CORWIN;

Well, that's correct .

The Court

11

in Texaco initially examined whether it was within the

12

legislature's power to do something like this, and there

13

was discussion of reasonableness.

14

QUESTION;

That is correct.

Before you get into your

15

Constitution argument, may I ask a question about a

16

possible reading of the statute?

17

The deadline here, it seems to me, December

18

31st,

19

where you say prior to a given date.

20

reading this statute rather hastily might incorrectly

21

assume before the end of the year is what was intended

22

by Congress because of the December 31st date.

is more apt to deceive someone than another date,
It seems to me one

23

And I notice that you have a footnote in your

24

brief in which you point out that you have been advised

25

by the agency that they started at a certain time

Why would they dc that if they didn't think
there was some possible ambiguity in the statute?

5

??S. CCEWISi

Well, I don't think it's a matter

6

of ambiguity, but I think the Secretary recognized that

7

there could be people who weren't really in tune xwith

8

the system yet.

9

date is.

10

The notice doesn’t simply say-what the

I think it says a little bit more than that.
QUESTION*

Doesn’t it remind

them to be sure

11

you realize it is the 2Cth and not the 31st?

12

is trade in the note.

13

5S. CORWIN;

That point

It dees phrase it as on or before

14

December 30th, which the regulations do as well, and I

15

think that is an attempt to make sure that people focus

16

on the fact that it doesn't lock as though December 31st

17

is part of this.

18

QUESTION!

Would it compromise the

19

government's interests in this whole program at all if

20

the statute were si m. pi 5 construed as though it had said

21

23

the necessity of deciding a constitutional question?

case?

1

MS. CORWIN;

Well, in terms of the

2

govern irent 's interests, locking simply at that,

3

suppose you would have to consider what has gone on

4

since the statute in terms of things that may have
occurred with relocations ly third parties.

QUESTION;

.Are there any other cases tut this

one in which the person missed it by one date?

My understanding from the filings

like that.

Doesn’t it at least seem

Congress thought it was doing and

MS. CORWIN;

was a little careless

Well, I think it is possible .

My

23

problem is that I dcn't think there is a 100 percent

24

possibility that that is what Congress meant.

I guess I

am only about 80 percent sure, or maybe less.

3

But the language is fairly clear on its face in

And for that reason I doubt my own initial

4

reaction tc this, because clearly whoever wrote it knew

5

that December 31st existed.

6

QUESTION:

Do you think it would be better for

7

the Court not to adopt that construction, but rather, to

8

go ahead and decide the constitutional issue?

9

MS. CORWIN:

Well, it seems tc me that it is

10

very difficult tc reach the reading that ycu have

11

suggested just because there is dcubt, because of the

12

language of the statute, because there are plausible

13

reasons why somebody might have perhaps wr c r.ghea de d ly

14

sat down and said, you know, we won't have people filing

15

on the last day cf the year, and for that reason, I

16

would think that you would have tc reach the

17

constitutional issue.

18

Obviously, in the interests cf the government,

19

it would help to have it resolved, but .1 am not

20

suggesting that that is a reason that ycu shouldn't

21

construe the statute,

22

are other problems with that approach.

23

QUESTION:

I am saying that I think there

Well, Ks. Corwin, you said ycu

24

thought it was fairly clear the statute should be

25

construed in a particular -- the wording,

I take it, is

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

"prior to December 31st.”

2

ambiguity at all in these feur words?

3
4

MS. CORWIN;

Co you think there is any

I don't think there's any

ambiguity on the face cf the statute, and I might ncte

5

that the Secretary has construed the language cf the

6

statute to be on or before December 30th, so if

7

were any ambiguity,

8

administrative construction to tack up your natural

9

reading cf the statute.

10

I suppose ycu cculd lock to the

the statute must have slipped and meant before the end

13

of the year.

14

15

acknowledge that they have missed the deadline, and as I

16

noted,

to disagree with that,

And there is nothing in the

legislative history that would support that, is there?
MS. CCEWIN;

I have simply feund nothing that

22

suggests one way or the other anything about that "prior

23

24

anything we can lock tc one way or the other there.

3

they had never proceeded tc patent cn those claims.

Following the enactment of FLPMA, they filed their

assessment werk with the local recorder’s office,

Since the statute does require filings prior

13

to December 31st, ELM advised appellees that their

14

claims were void by operation of the statute, and that

15

is because cf Section 314(c), which is the provision

16

that is really at the heart of this case.

17

Congress provided there that the failure tc

18

comply with the filing requirements would be deemed

19

conclusively to constitute an abandonment of the claim.

20

In ether words, compliance with the filing requirement

21

would be a condition tc continued retention of the

Of course, the language the statute

used tied it up with an abandonment, didn’t it?

7

Well, that is rather a strange way

Well, it sounds to me like it is

I will put it that way.
MS. CORWIN*

Well, it is possibly inartful,

and it is certainly circumlocution.

I think it was kind

10

of a roundabout way of getting to what Congress was

11

after, but I don't think there is any doubt either from

12

the face of

13

that what Congress really had in mind was that if you

14

don't

in a timely manner, you are going to lose your claim.

even a negligent failure to file, with an intention to

think that they were equating failure to file,

It doesn’t make a whcle let cf sense.
MS. CORWIN*

I think what they did was use a

23

twe-step procedure, which is sort of roundabout.

24

said failure to file will be the equivalent of

abandonment, and we all know that abandonment means you

It also usually means that you have

some intention to dc sc.

4

MS. CCRWIN:

Kell, in the common law sense

5

that is so, but I don't thirk it is necessarily unusual

in that there are statutes that are phrased in this sort

Congress’s constitutional pewer to enact a prevision

like this, to impose a filing deadline as a condition

for retention of the claim.

I might note that the American Mining

11

of this provision, a proponent, and had in fact proposed

points, I suppose.

The appellees here could simply lock at the regulation

and see on the face of it what the answer was.

simply thinking about the interests of big groups.

The situation of the mining claimant is that

they come and they gc in a let of cases.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court,

19

ten unpatented mining claims near Ely, Nevada, which

20

they have operated for 24 years.

21

the Bureau of Land Management in Reno issued an opinion

22

stating that the Locke's claims were deemed tc be

23

abandoned because they had filed an annual affidavit one

24

day late.

25

as pointed

out by the appellants, the Lockes own

On April 4th,

1981,

The Lockes had fully complied with the statute
23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the prior year in regard tc their initial filings.

2

Under the Act, they were required

3

of location for each of their claims, maps, affidavits,

4
5

6

to file certificates

and they did all of that prior tc the deadline in
Cctobe r cf 1979 .
The court found below that the ELM had then

7

opened a file on the Lockes shewing their claims tc be

8

active mining claims.

9

provides that the failure to file any of the instruments

Now, the statute at issue herein

10

required in the Act shall be deemed conclusively to

11

constitute an abandonment of the claim by the owner.

12

The District Court viewed that as an

13

irrebuttable presumption which to us seems pretty

14

obvious on its face, and decided the case in accordance

15

with this Court’s decision in Viandis versus Klein and

16

other irrebuttable presumption cases.

17

The Court found that because that presumption

18

of abandonment wasn’t unnecessary or universally true,

19

especially where tbe Lockes had operated their claims

20

for 24 years, and indicated by filing their documents

21

that they didn’t intend to abandon, they should have a

22

hearing or some method by which they should have ar

23

opportunity to rebut presumption.

24
25

New, the appellants attacked the District
Court’s decision by saying that this doesn’t present an
24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

irrebuttable presumption at all, and they argue further

2

that the court ought tc decide the case in accordance

3

with Texaco versus Short.

4

We think, this is a pretty novel

5

interpretation, and the Court should lock at the

6

statute, look, at what it says cn its face, and net

7

search

for other meanings ir. other cases.

ME. SWAFFCEDi

Yes.

with it, because it did set up abandonment, I think, as

Here, we do have the clear, irrebuttable

The Court looked at all of the acts, the
