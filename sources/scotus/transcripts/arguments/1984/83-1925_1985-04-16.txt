Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

17

please the Court, we are asking the Court today to

18

uphold the long acknowledged right of state and local

19

government to legislate in order to protect the health

20

of its people.

21

The particular health concern involved in this

22

case is the operation of local plasmapheresis centers in

23

Hillsborough County, Florida.

24

address our concerns, and before we enforced those

25

ordinances, we were sued by one of the local plasma

cente rs .
At trial, the District Ccurt found that our

3

ordinances were constitutional with one exception, but

4

the Court of Appeals reversed and held that we were

5

absolutely preempted in this field from ever regulating

6

because of the comprehensive FDA regulations covering

7

the same subject matter.

8
9

He submit that that Eleventh Circuit opinion
which held that we were impliedly preempted is incorrect

10

because in this case there is an express statement by

11

the FDA that they never intended to "usurp the powers of

12

state and local authorities to regulate plasmapheresis

13

procedures in their own localities."

14

The Eleventh Circuit also erred in implying

15

preemption based upon the three findings, that the

16

federal regulations were pervasive, were dominant, and

17

that our regulations were in conflict with the federal

18

regulat ions.

19

First of all, there is no conflict.

It is net

20

impossible to comply with both systems of regulation

21

simultaneously.

22

regulations supplement and complement the federal scheme

23

rather than conflicting with it, and in fact they found

24

that we added four additional protections particularly

25

aimed at protecting the health of local paid donors.

The trial court found that our

QUESTION:

Ms. Acton, I gaess the Solicitor

2

General's brief identifies at least one local regulation

3

that the Solicitor General says would be preempted, the

4

one that Hillsborough would have that would prevent

5

someone with,

6

a donor, and such people are needed in some

7

circumstances for the plasma.

8
9
10

for instance, active hepatitis from being

Do you agree that there might be preemption to
that extent?
MS.

ACTON;

No, I don't, because I don't

11

believe that there is a conflict.

12

before we get to the issue of whether there is a

13

conflict, there doesn't appear to be an actual conflict

14

with this particular center on this record before the

15

Court in that they don't engage in that.

16
17

QUESTION;

MS.

19

QUESTION;

21

Well, your position is just that

this center doesn't have standing, I guess.

18

20

In the first place,

ACTON;

That's correct.
But aside from that problem, would

you agree there is a possible conflict there?
MS.

ACTON;

No, I don't, and the reason I

22

don't is because our regulations expressly incorporate

23

the special exception present in the federal regulations

24

which allows fcr a center to not follow any of the

25

prescribed regulations by the federal government if they

2

get express written consent from the Commissioner.
In

that we incorporate that particular

3

provision by reference, I don’t think this Court could

4

go ahead and assume that there is a conflict there

5

before it is on the record.

6

That particular provision that the Solicitor

7

General was interested in and thought there might be a

8

conflict with has to do with our requirement that there

9

be a total health check of a prospective paid doner

10

11

prior to his even setting foot inside a plasma center.
This is different from the federal regulations

12

which require that center to check the person out when

13

he walks an, and this provision of our local ordinances

14

protects the other persons in the centers from possible

15

exposure to contageous diseases such as hepatitis.

16

The most important provision, we feel,

of our

17

ordinances is that we provide for a single center

18

iden\tification card.

19

prohibit persons from overbleeding themselves in

20

contravention

21

regulations, which only provide enforcement mechanisms

22

at a single center.

23

With that card, this would

to the goal set forth by the federal

In other words, under our regulations, persons

24

would not be able to go from center to center where the

25

FDA does not cross check their records and accomplish in

2

effert what the FDA prohibits.
Third of all, our regulations provide that the

3

prospective paid donors undergo a breath alcohol test

4

prior to undergoing the risk involved in the procedure

5

so that they can appreciate those risks, and so that

6

they can give an accurate medical history to the center

7

personnel, who are required under the federal

8

regulations to ask them those questions.

9

And finally, we provide a local enforcement

10

system which supplements the federal system of

11

enforcement and which the FDA representatives at trial

12

testified would be helpful for them.

13

Now, appellee, its amici, and the Eleventh

14

Circuit don’t point to any conflict between the

15

regulations.

16

the federal goal of a national supply of plasma that

17

will be adequate to meet the nation’s needs, but there

18

is simply nothing on the record that would support this

19

before this Court.

20

They point to a hypothetical conflict with

This was in fact one of the claims that was

21

made at trial, and the claim that the District Court

22

specifically rejected as being too speculative.

23

Furthermore, the FDA in this case has stated that it

24

sees no threat from these ordinances in affecting a

25

blood supply,

and they are the agency charged with

balancing the regulations as opposed to the adequacy of

2

the supply.
QUESTIONS

3

Ms. Acton, do you know how many

4

other local governments or states have regulations

5

similar to those in Hillsborough?
MS.

6

ACTON*

We attempted to ascertain that,

7

and the latest information we could find was, as of 1975

8

the FDA conducted a very unscientific survey of how many

9

states had this type of regulation, and they reported

10

that approximately 26 did, but I can’t represent that

11

they — well,

12

mailed out questionnaires, and not all the states

13

replied.

14

this time.

the course of that survey was that they

So, no, I don’t have complete information at

15

At any rate, in this case, because we have a

16

federal statement of an express intent not to preempt,

17

this case can he distinguished from almost every other

18

case that this Court has written, and furthermore, that

19

statement completely dispels any ambiguity that might

20

have been raised by the mere fact of comprehensive

21

regulations existing and by the fact of a dominant

22

national concern for the blood supply.

23
24
25

QUESTION*

Ms. Acton, was that statement

before the Court of Appeals when it decided this case?
MS.

ACTON*

No, regrettably it was not

submitted to the Court of Appeals.
QUESTIGN:

Perhaps if it had been, the Court

of Appeals might have come out differently on it.
MS.

ACTON*

It very veil could have.

The

5

statement by the FDA as well as the lack of conflict

6

between the two schemes provides more than adequate

7

grounds for this Court to reverse the decision of the

8

Eleventh Circuit and to uphold our right to legislate in

9

this area of public health.

I would like to reserve the remainder of my
time for rebuttal if I might.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. LARKIN , JR., ESQ.,

15

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
IN SUPPORT OF THE APPELLANTS

16
17

ME.

LARKIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

18

may it please the Court, the only issue decided by the

19

Court of Appeals in this case, and the only issue before

20

the Court is whether the FDA's regulations have

21

completely prevented the county from going ahead and

22

adopting the regulatory scheme that it has in this case.

23

The FDA takes the position now, as it did at

24

the time it promulgated these regulations, that they

25

were not intended completely to foreclose any further
10
ALOER^ON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

supplementation by state or local governments.

The

2

regulations as they were adopted in 1973 didn't state

3

any attempt to preempt.

4

they have been supplemented since then, and there is nc

5

real dispute on that point.

They don't today, even though

The dispute comes on the question of whether

6
7

the comprehensive nature of the regulations impliedly

8

preempts any further supplementation, and the agency

9

believes that the statement in its preamble is a

10

conclusive answer to that question.
There was a concern directly addressed to the

11

12

agency at the time it adopted these regulations that the

13

plasmapheresis regulations that the agency was going tc

14

adopt would preempt the states, and the FDA clearly said

15

it had no intention of doing so.
Now, the appellees and the amici in support

16
17

don't claim that that is ambiguous, and they do not

18

claim that it was not an authoritative statement.

19

Basically, their claim is that the FDA has changed its

20

mind over the decade that has occurred since then, and

21

they rely on a variety of different items in support of

22

that claim, but none of them can justify the result they

23

seek.

24
25

The item they rely on most heavily is the
National Blood Policy that the FDA promulgated — excu-se

2

promulgated the following year, in 1974.

3

was that, a policy.

It was not a regulation.

4

preempt the fields.

It didn’t state that preemption was

5

necessary to carry out any of the goals that the policy

6

stated.

7

That policy
It didn’t

The policy didn’t discuss preemption at all.

8

And it implied guite clearly and stated at several

9

points guite expressly that there would be both a

10

cooperative effort between the federal government and

11

the states and between both of the governmental areas

12

and private industry.

13

In fact, it was envisioned that the private

14

sector would carry out the implementation of this goal.

15

The appellees and the amici have also relied on several

16

statements that the agency has made when it has

17

promulgated additional regulations in this area, two

18

particular types of regulations in particular.

19

One deals with regulations designed to cover

20

the manufacture of blood plasma into plasma products.

21

Nothing in the preamble to those regulations or the

22

regulations themselves indicates that the agency ever

23

intended to retract its earlier statement or that

24

preemption was necessary in ordr to carry out this

25

further area.
12

The agency also decided to extend the

regulations that it had originally adopted in 1973 in

certain respects in order to ensure the safety of donors

was preserved when plasma was obtained not only for use

5

in humans in injectable products, as the term is used,

6

but also for use for laboratory and scientific use.
But neither those regulations nor the

7

8

preambles can reasonably be read to conclude that the

9

agency at any rate wittingly or unwittingly changed its

10

mind in this matter.
The last item they rely on are the guidelines

the FDA has adopted and the standard operating

would support a claim that the agency has extensively

the states to go forward.
Appellees and amici have also greatly relied

on the claim that there will be a frustration of federal

4

The county's regulations in no way would

5

adversely affect the first two federal goals.

The only

6

dispute is whether they would decrease the supply.

7

tfs. Acton has pointed out, the District Court found to

8

the contrary based on the evidence in the record before

9

it. Appellees and amici have basically attempted to

As

10

relitigate that factual issue in this Court, even though

11

they have not expressly asked the Court to find that the

12

District Court’s finding was clearly erroneous.

13

Given the agency's statement of its intent,

14

which it has never retracted, which was issued at the

15

time it issued the regulations,

16

essentially has the same force as tne regulation itself,

17

and the fact that there is going to be no frustration cf

18

federal policies, the agency doesn’t see any need to

19

preempt the regulations and ordinances that the county

20

has adopted in this case.

21

22
23

and therefore

Unless the Court has any questions, I have
nothing further.

QUESTION*

Way I just ask one question?

It is

24

perhaps similar to one already asked, but to what extent

25

is the local regulation in this area a matter of state

11

So it is really quite varied.

I don't think

there is any direct answer I can give to that.
QUESTION:

I thought the government's brief

12

identified one section'of the local regulation that it

13

did think was preempted or in conflict with the federal

14

laws and regulations.

15

Yes, Your Honor, there is one area of

16

potential conflict.

17

you can't issue a donor identification card in the

18

county if you have a history of hepatitis, so the fact

19

that a center in the county may have an exemption and

20

may be able to apply its procedure to a person who comes

21

in with an identification card doesn't help if the

22

person can't get the identification card at the outset.

23

So,

The problem arises in the fact that

the county has incorporated the federal

24

regulations, and they may also incorporate the exemption

25

process, but it is not entirely clear to us that that
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

would necessarily ha sufficient.
QUESTION*

3

Do you agree that the appellees

here don't have standing then to raise that?

4

MR. LARKIN*

Yes, Your Honor.

They have never

5

identified in their complaint, in their briefs,

6

anywhere, as far as we know, that they have an exemption

7

or that they have any right that is being infringed

8

under the federal regulations in this respect.

12

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR.

13

STUMPF;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

14

please the Court, not surprisingly, we take quite a

15

contrary view with regard to the correctness of the

16

Eleventh Circuit opinion, and most specifically the

17

legal standard that the Eleventh Circuit applied.
It is our position that the Eleventh Circuit

18

19

applied the correct legal standard, and that this Court

20

should affirm the decision below on that opinion.

21

submit that affirmance of this case on the Eleventh

22

Circuit opinion would be consistent with sound and

23

recent precedent of this Court, would be consistent with

24

sound policy, and would be consistent with simple

logic.

issue of law as suggested by my adversaries, and does

not mandate a significant change in well settled

principles of preemption analysis.

of express Congressional intent to preempt an area, that

it is necessary to a finding of preemption that the

10

regulating agency has specifically expressed the intent

11

to preempt the field.
It is our position that a trilogy of very

12
13

recent decisions decided by xhis Court demonstrate that

14

that, the rule being advocated by the Solicitor General

15

is not now the present rule of law with respect to

16

preemption analysis, and that it should not be the rule

17

of law with regard to preemption analysis.
The three cases I am referring to, of course,

18
19

are De La 2uesta, the Capital Cities case, and the

20

Michigan Canners case, about which we all spent a great

21

deal of time discussing in our brief.

The agency comment that is now relied upon was

6
7

made in

1973.

It was a comment made by the Commissioner

8

in commenting cn comments that were received by the

9

agency in response to a specific set of proposed rules.
Just one year before that comment was made,

10
11

the FDA was given the authority to regulate in this

12

area.

14

Prior to that it had been, I believe, the Public

16

intended to usurp.

18

of injectable products.

Since that time, the evolution of the

this area has expanded dramatically, and I

21

will concede that we have not been able to find an

22

express statement by the FDA that tn e new, the

23

continually evolving, expanded, more comprehensive

24

regulations, we can't find an agency expression of

25

intent to preempt.

QUESTION:

But here you have the Solicitor

3

General in a brief in this Court speaking for the FDA#

4

which is the relevant agency, saying as of now there is

5

no intent to preempt.

6

MR.

STUMPF:

And I submit, Mr. Justice

7

Rehnquist, that to adopt that rule advocated by the

8

Solicitor General or even, with all due respect,

9

Solicitor General's position in this case cannot

10
11

the

withstand analysis.
Let me try to explain that.

The foundation,

12

of course, for preemption is the supremacy clause.

13

supremacy clause, of course, says federal law is tne

14

supreme law of the land.

15

that it is in the — the national interest requires

16

federal regulation of an area, and whether that

17

regulation is done either by a comprehensive, detailed

18

statute, or whether the regulation is done, as it is in

19

this case, with what I call a more skeleton statute,

20

which the agency fills the field with the detailed and

21

technical regulations, that you look to see whether the

22

system in total fills the field.

23

The

Where Congress has determined

Under the rule of law that is advocated in

24

this case, the determining element would be the comments

25

of the agency made at the time the regulations are
20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

enacted that would determine whether preemption exists

2

or not.

3

and frankly as a matter of constitutional law.

4

I submit that is unsound as a matter of policy,

QUESTION*

There is no suggestion by the

5

Solicitor General, I take it, that if there is a square

6

conflict between the regulations and the state law, the

7

state law would have to give way.

8

MR.

STUMPF;

9

QUESTION;

I agree with that —
Nor does he challenge the fact that

10

if the state law would really frustrate some purpose,

11

that the state law would have to give way.

12

MR. STUMPF;

13

QUESTION;

14

I read the Solicitor General's —
You are just disagreeing on whether

or not there is a total occupation of the field.

15

MR. STUMPF;

16

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

However —

Do you say that that is what

17

Congress intended, independent of what the FDA is

18

telling us now?
MR.

19

Is that your view?

STUMPF;

It is my view that under the

20

supremacy clause, federal law is the supreme law of the

21

land.

22

the regulations authorized by Congress thereunder, so

23

that you look to the entire federal scheme of

24

regulations.

25

That federal law includes both the statute and

So, what I am saying, Mr. Chief Justice, is
21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that — and the case law, of course, is replete with

2

examples of this, that even in the absence of express

3

Congressional intent to preempt, and in the absence of

4

express agency intent to preempt, a finding of

5

preemption properly made when the field of regulation

6

has been filled —

7

QUESTION:

How do you square that with the

8

often repeated statement here that we pay great

9

deference to the views of the agency created by Congress

10

11

to administer these complex programs?
MR. SIUMPF:

I square that in this way, Mr.

12

Chief Justice.

13

proposition that in dealing with the technical aspects

14

of tie regulation,

15

should we go in regulating, that a deference is properly

16

made to the agency having the expertise to deal in,

17

shall I say, the nuts and bolts of the area.

18

I think those cases stand for the

what do the regulations mean, how far

I don't — I think it is clear that the

19

question of whether an area has been preempted is a

20

question for the judiciary and not for the executive,

21

and that is why I come back to saying that under the

22

rule of law advanced by the Solicitor General — maybe

23

an example.

24

enacts what I call the skeleton statute.

25

You can have a situation where Congress

The agency fills the field, and they are

sileat with respect tc their intent.

You can have, in

2

two separate areas, you could have exactly the same

3

system of statutory authorization to the agency and the

4

filling of the field by the agency.
Dnder the rule advanced by the Solicitor

5
6

General, the determining element would be comments made

7

by the agency at some point in the evolution of the

8

enactment of the regulations.

9

detec mi nati/e, what the agency says.

That would be

To reduce it to perhaps more practical

10
11

language, I am suggesting that we must look to what the

12

agency has done and not to what the agency says.

13

that is where I make the distinction, and that is how I

sguare it.

QUESTION:

MR.

If it is not estoppel, what is it?

STUMPF:

What I am suggesting, Mr. Justice

Marshall, is that the question of whether a federal

6

system of regulation is preempted in the field is to be

7

determined by the courts, and not to be determined by

8

the agency itself.

9

And I think, that that statement finds support

10

in the supremacy clause, which of course is the

11

benchmark for this entire discussion of preemption.

12

supremacy clause gives to the legislature —

he says is the present policy of the agency?
MR.

STUMPF:

What I have to counteract those,

16

again as opposed to what their position is, what they

17

say their position is, is, I have the comprehensiveness

18

of the regulations, the pervasiveness of the

19

regulations, and the three-tiered policy that those

20

reguliations furthered, as stated by Mr. Larkin, the

21

period of the product, the safety of the donor, and

22

perhaps most importantly, to assure that there is an

23

adequate supply of plasma, which of course is the raw

material for vitally important pharmaceutical products.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

be saying is that a little bit of frustration or a

littLe bit of conflict with feieral policies is okay.

They say they don’t now take the position that there is

5

There may come a time in the future when the

diminished supply of plasma resulting from the

enforcement of local ordinances becomes important

8

enough, as it were, so that it would raise to the

dignity of preemption.

10

I don’t think that’s an acceptable standard.

11

I think we have to look now at the comprehensiveness of

12

the regulations, and we have to make the determination

13

that local legislation is wholly preempted.

take that position because of the national policy of

of the national policy of maintaining the supply now,

now is the time to affirm the Eleventh Circuit finding,

that enforcement of these local ordinances would

fine, sir
I would like to add a little more to Justice

2
3

O'Connor's questions about the states with similar

4

regulations.

5

most, I believe, are — it is probably split between

6

local and state regulations.

The number is in the mid-twenties, and

The significant point about them is that most

7

8

of those go right up to the line of the federal

9

regulations and don’t go beyond it.

This is one of the

10

first instances where the regulations actually go beyond

11

the federal regulations, and that is what causes the

12

concern in this case.
In addition to that, there are at least two

13
14

pending examples of additional statewide legislation

15

that is coming along that the industry feels will be a

16

problem.

17

Texas is proposing a registration ordinance

18

which doesn't go as far in some ways as Hillsborough

19

County but in other ways it goes beyond it, and

20

California is also considering legislation which deals

21

with how the blood industry deals with its donors.

22

The Solicitor General made the comment that we

23

are relying on the Kational Blood Policy, but that is

24

only a policy.

25

reasoning behind that.

It is a little hard to understand the
It is a policy, but it is a
29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

policy where the agency of which FDA is a part

2

considered over a period of time what the policy of the

3

United States ought to be with respect to blood and

4

blood products, and it concluded several important

5

things,

6

and Hillsborough County ignore many of the passages in

7

the National Blood Policy that we feel govern this

8

case.

9

and the Solicitor General, the United States,

The seventh paragraph of the policy statement

10

statas that "It is the policy of the United States

11

government," which in itself is a very broad way of

12

entering the subject, "to employ the full regulatory

13

authorities now vested in the federal government for tne

14

purpose of assuring uniform adherence to the highest

15

attainable standards of practice in blood banking,

16

including plasmapheresis."

17

So, right from the very start we have a

18

National Blood Policy that does take in plasmapheresis.

19

It talks about the highest attainable standards.

20

talks about assuring uniform adherence to that.

21

National Blood Policy also states that it is the policy

22

of the United

including ia benefits in national health insurance and

2

private health insurance benefits for blood and blood

3

products, including cost of plasma acquisition.

4

So,

this is not a mere policy.

It is a very

5

comprehensive policy issued by the parent agency of FDA,

6

and we submit that it should be binding on FDA, and FDA

7

can't lightly look away from it and ignore it.

8

The government has argued that the

9

preamble statement is ample support and is dispositive

10

for this Court to reverse the Eleventh Circuit.
QUESTIONS

11

Kay I interrupt with just one

12

question?

If the national policy is the strictest

13

possible standard, the highest possible standard, and

14

if, as I understand the record to indicate, in some

15

respects the ordinance is even more strict than the

16

federal regulation, how can that violate the national

policy?

The fundamental — this fundamental concept —
