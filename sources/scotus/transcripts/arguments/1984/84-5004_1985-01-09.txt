5

Here we have the exact same facts.

When Hr.

6

Ball reached into that bag of beer, he was guilty cf

7

both receipt and possession by that act, and Batchelder

8

said that Congress had intended in passing these two

9

statutes to have two independent statutes each fully

10

enforceable on their own terms, and Batchelder also

11

confirmed that this very conduct violated both

sta tut es.

the answer is yes, the other Blockburger questions are

2

just irrelevant.

If the answer is no, they are also

Yes, Your Honor, I think that is

true.

9

legislative history, to see what can be gleaned there,

Blockburger is a statutory construction, but

The first is to look at the

10

and if there is no clear intent indicated either in the

11

legislative history or in the statute itself, then cne

12

resorts to the test of Blockburger to determine what

13

Congress’s intent was in passing those two statutes.

14
15

So, yes, you are correct, as I understand it,
that it is a statutory construction problem.

16

The Cireuits -- the Courts of Appeals that

17

have considered this question, all except the Tenth

18

Circuit say that there is -- there was no cumulative

19

punishment intended by Congress when they passed these

20

two statutes.

These Circuits base their analysis, all except
the Third, which is underneath a case which the

government conceded, but the other Circuits all base

2

their analysis on the Eatchelder case, where the Court

3

in Eatchelder had said that the government could

4

prosecute on either.

5

The Circuits then interpreted this to mean

6

that the government could net prosecute all the way to

7

judgment, to conviction, to sentence on both of these

8

statutes at the same time.

9

These same Circuits say when the government

10

has net chosen either one or the other but has chosen

11

instead to proceed on both statutes, that the remedy

12

there is to vacate one conviction and one sentence.

13

This is all except the Fourth Circuit, of course.

14

Fourth Circuit says that the remedy is to make the

15

sentences run cone urre ntly.

But even if the.Circuits'

reasoning is wrong

under

themselves and to the Congressional history, there is no

explicit clear statement in any of that indicating that

20

Congress intended to cumulatively punish under these

statutes, and the most recent case of visscuri against

Hunter teaches us what kind of language should be there

Those two convictions could possibly be used against him

12

QUESTION*

Well,

has this Court specifically

13

held that a second conviction with a concurrent sentence

14

is to be treated as punishment for purposes of the

15

double jeopardy clause?

16

MS. WIDENER;

Your Honor, I could find no

17

specific holding as to that effect.

18

I looked back, through the cases, it seemed to me that in

19

all cases except for the line of cases under Prince,

20

that the remedy when there is a double jeopardy question

21

has been to reverse the judgment or tc vacate the

22

conviction.

23

and not just the vacating of the sentence, as the Fourth

24

Circuit has done here.

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

unrealistic to suggest that he, pitted against a well

2

educated and well trained prosecutor, could possibly

3

convince a jury that these two — that he should not

4

have two convictions here,

5

conviction.

6

that he should only have one

Nor could he convince a sentencing judge in

7

the future that he should not have two convictions here,

8

he should simply have one, because the vary fact of

9

those two convictions existing on that paper seem to

10

indicate to a judge that he is guilty of both.

11

QUESTIONS

Perhaps even if your Blockburger

12

analysis is right, the answer is, he may not be

13

sentenced on both convictions, but he can be convicted

14

on both of them, and in that case your argument that he

15

couldn't convince people that he shouldn't have had two

16

convictions would be true because he ought not tc be

17

able to convince people that he shouldn't have two

18

convie tions.

19

NS. WIDENEBi

Well, Your Honor, I would, I

20

guess,

21

not told us specifically what to do in this situation,

22

it has not told us when this conduct violates those two

23

statutes, whether we should convict or sentence under

24

both.

25

fall back on the argument that since Congress has

We do know, however, that it has not
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

authorized two convictions for either of these

2

statutes.

3

here is a conviction and punishment under either of

4

those statutes.

5

The only punishment that it has authorized

I do not believe that without a clear

6

statement that more than one statute is violated or what

7

to do in the case when more than one statute is

8

violated, that you could impose an extra punishment on

9

him which in this case his conviction

10

would be an extra

punishment.

11

QUESTION;

As I read the government's brief,

12

they are really arguing a sort of harmless error without

13

calling it that.

14

statement which is directly contrary to the one you have

15

just tcld us, and I would like to see which is correct.

16

At Page 5 of

their brief they make a

The government says here,

the additional

17

conviction will not increase the defendant's prison

18

term, and will not impose any ether adverse consequence

19

upon him.

20
21

Now, in your earlier argument, I believe, you
said that is not so.

22

MS. WIDE NEE;

Yes, Your Honor.

That is not

23

so.

24

that he is serving right now, but under what the Court

25

of Appeals did when they made these sentences run*

probation right now.

So that in addition to his three-year

sentence, should for any reason, and of course prison is

7

the next nine months he should get into any small

of prison regulations, he would then be

10

upon him for doing that in the prison, but he would also

11

be subject to having his — to being called back before

Because you think, that is the

MS. WIDENER:

I don't

8

think

9

that when the same conduct violates those two statutes,

there is anything anywhere that would indicate

10

he should be convicted under both because of the adverse

11

consequence of that extra conviction, that it is

12

something that is going to follow him around forever.

13

QUESTIONS

Well, assuming you are right, but

14

there are still concurrent sentences, and you must at

15

least convince us that the two convictions instead of

16

one will have an adverse consequence on your client.

17

MS. WIDENERi

Well, Your Honor, I believe that

18

the convictions will have, because of the concept of

19

recidivism statutes, where he now under this record has

Then it may not be a rule that

Circuit has an interesting way of

11

applying the concurrent sentence rule.

interests involved.

Since there is no interest that the government

16

actually has to protect, and the government here has

conceded that in their brief, that they really have no

about right now.

20

Since the government has no interest to

protect, and since the possible adverse legal

consequences to the defendant are very real to him,

Just in terms of tha practical

short while ago where a man on his employment

application answered no to whether he had been convicted

of a felony, and he was later discharged because he made

a false answer.

Well, in any event, when you say

the double jeopardy clause — when you talk about

multiple punishments, you are just talking about

MR. PINCUS;

The legislative intent is the

inquiry, Justice Rehnquist, but in order for there to be

that.
QUESTION;

Hell, then, why do you refer to the

double jeopardy clause?
MR. PINCUS;

Because in order for that clause

there is a deviation from what Congress intended, there

still would have to be some kind of a multiple

2

punishment in order for a petitioner, for the petitioner

3

in this case to rely on a clause as supplying some kind

4

of an affirmative remedy.

5

I just want to reiterate our argument based on

6

the concurrent sentence doctrine, because we believe

7

that really the principle underlying that doctrine

8

supports our position in this case,

9

really as it is now applied by the Courts of Appeals is

because the doctrine

10

based on the notion that a conviction with no adverse

11

consequences will not prejudice a defendant, and

12

therefore the conviction can be affirmed even though it

13

is unreviewed.

14

If petitioner is punished in some way by the

15

second conviction,

16

that there is no prejudice, and therefore could

17

undermine the concurrent sentence doctrine, which we

18

believe is a useful tool used by the Courts of Appeals

19

to avoid reaching issues that don't really have to be

then it conflicts with this notion

Unless the Court has any further questions, we
urge that the judgment be affirmed.
