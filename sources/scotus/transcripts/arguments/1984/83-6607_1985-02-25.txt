ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. THOMAS BOYLE, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. BOYLE;
Court,

Mr. Chief Justice, members of the

this case is here on certiorari to the

10

Mississippi Supreme Court.

11

I would like to address in this appeal.

12

There are three issues that

The first is whether or not the remarks by the

13

prosecutor that the verdict, jury verdict is non-final

14

and subject to appellate review constitutes

15

constitutional error.

16

not there was a denial of Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment

17

rights in denying experts and a criminal investigator.

18

The second issue is whether or

And thirdly, whether certain remarks by the

19

prosecutor at the sentencing phase of the trial, wherein

20

he alluded and compared this case with all the other

21

capital cases that he had tried, whether or not that

22

constitutes plain error which this Court should notice

23

under the due process clause.

24
25

The facts with regard to the first issue are
as follows.

Under Mississippi practice, the prosecutor
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

has the right to open and close during summation.

2

During the rebuttal portion of his summation to the

3

jury,

4

he argued, your decision is not the final

decision.

5

Your decision is reviewable.
Defense counsel immediately objected.

The

6

court ruled on that objection and overruled it, stating

7

that under the Mississippi death statute there was in

8

fact mandatory review of decisions by the jury in a

9

capital case, and instructed the prosecutor to make full

10

expression of his argument.

11

The prosecutor proceeded to state to the jury

12

that defense counsel had wrongfully insinuated that

13

their decision was not final, and again repeated that it

14

was subject to review.

15
16

QUESTION:

He did a little more than that,

didn't he?

17

MR. BOYLE.-

18

QUESTION;

Yes.
He said, in effect, if you render a

19

verdict of guilty here and return that sentence, you

20

will be the killers.

21

MR. BOYLE;

Yes,

he did.

Your Honor, on

22

appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court with regard to

23

this issue, assigned appellate counsel failed to set

24

this forth in the claim of error statement which is

25

required to be filed under Fule 6E of the rules of the
4

(202) 628-9300

1

Mississippi Supreme Court.

2
3
4

The Mississippi Supreme Court split four to
four,

with one judge disqualifying himself.

The court

rulei

-- based its decision primarily on three grounds,

5

first, that under this Court's decision in California

6

aginst Ramos, that the states were free to determine

7

what the jury would hear in this area, and felt that

8

this was appropriate argument.

9

Secondly, they maintained that this was

10

invited error by suggesting that imprisonment was for

11

the rest of the petitioner's natural life, and thirdly,

12

the court held that the issue was foreclosed by virtue

13

of the failure of counsel tc comply with Pule 6B.

14

Petitioner maintains that the remarks violated

15

the due process clause and the Eighth Amendment first on

16

the gcound that those remarks were false and misleading

17

to the jury.

18

forth in the petitioner's brief at 6A of our appendix to

19

that brief, on its face and as construed by that court,

20

is a final determination.

21

The statute involved here, and it is set

It is the sole and exclusive function of the

22

jury in the state of Mississippi to ascertain and

23

determine the appropriate sentence in a capital case.

24

The argument here that they were not the final

25

determiners of that sentence is simply false.
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Moreover, it was false also in suggesting to

2

the jury that someone else shared the responsibility

3

which under that state statute is solely and exclusively

4

theirs .

5

QUESTION*

Mr. Boyle, in your view, would it

6

be error or a violation of due process for a court to

7

instruct a jury correctly and accurately concerning the

8

existence and scope of appellate review?

9

MR. BOYLE*

It would not, Your Honor.

10

However, I respectfully submit to the Court that it

11

would be a much different case for this Court to

12

consider were it not for the fact that counsel here

13

arguej

14

it was a non-final judgment.

15

in addition to the review element the fact that

Secondly, we maintain that the argument by the

16

prosecutor unconstitutionally diminshed the jury's

17

responsibility for imposition of the death sentence.

18

The remarks here were intended to overcome the jurors'

19

natural reluctance to return a death sentence by

20

diluting their responsibility for the consequence of

21

those actions.

22

The dissent below pointed out that a juror in

23

deliberation is going to be — feeling that death is an

24

inappropriate sentence, is simply going to be much less

25

likely to hold out in the event that he or she knew that
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

any error could be corrected in connection with an

2

appeal .

3
4

This Court in the Witherspoon case admittedly
in a totally different context indicated that it is a

5

fundamental guarantee of due process that the decision

6

as to whether a person lives or dies must be made on

7

scales that are not deliberately tipped toward death.

8

We respectfully submit to this Court that the

9

prosecutor's argument here encouraged the jurors to err

10

on the side of death with the false assurance that if

11

death is not appropriate, the Supreme Court will correct

12

that error.

13

The verdict based on such remarks is one in

14

which the jurors'

15

unconstitutional proportions.

16

moral responsibility is diminished to

I would like to briefly discuss the California

17

against Fames case, which we submit is simply not

18

controlling in this case, and we make that argument for

19

the following reasons.

20

Ramos,

21

were paying due deference tc the state statute, the

22

enactment by the legislature of the state of California.

23

First, in California againt

this Court made it very, very clear that they

Here, on the other hand, we are dealing with

24

the remarks of a prosecutor, and although there is

25

legislation in this area to the effect that there is
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

mandatory review, that legislation, unlike the Briggs

2

instructions, does not embody also the instruction that

3

the jury be told about it.

4
5

And so we respectfully submit that that is a
very, very significant distinction.

6

QUESTION;

But isn’t that a state law

7

distinction in essence?

8

distinction vanishes if the Mississippi legislature had

9

said that juries ought to be told about this, and if

I mean, would you say the

10

your answer to that is yes, why isn't the Mississippi

11

Supreme Court a prefectly good spokesman for state

12

policy, just as the legislature would be?

13

MR. BOYLEi

If we are talking just about that

14

element, that would be a matter for the state to

15

determine and so advise the judges of the trial courts

16

that this is a matter for particular instruction fcr the

17

jury.

18

We have the element in this case, Justice

19

Rehngjist, of a misleading statement in addition to the

20

comment and interrelated to the comment on judicial

21

review .

22

QUESTION;

But I thought your point that you

23

were just making had nothing to do with the misleading

24

character, but had something to do about articulated

25

state policy.
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. BOYLE;

There is another reason with

2

reg ard to the state policy why it would not be

3

ad miss ible, and that is, this Court made it clea r that

4

under California law in the Ramos case evidence was

5

permit ted on the factor which this Court equated with

6

future dangerousness as being a question of fact , and

7

eviden ce was admissible with regard to that elem ent, and

8

counse 1 could comment on it.

9

You don’t have that situation here.

H ere you

10

have t he unmitigated, I submit to the Court, dan ger of

11

specul ation solely on what these nine Justices o f the

12

Missis sippi Supreme Court will do, and I submit that the

13

a rbitr ary and capricious nature of that speculat ion is

14

nc nor e visible in this case where you have this four to

15

four s plit which affirmed and one judge disquali fying,

16

and th en, as we pointed out in our brief, at a 1 ater

17

time t he judge who disqualified himself actually joined

18

the di ssenting opinion here to make it the major ity .

19

QUESTION;

Then you are saying,

I gues s,

that

20

a stat e supreme court is not to be given the sam e

21

defers nee as a state legislature in speaking out on a

22

m a t te r of state policy.

23

MR. BOYLE;

I don’t think we are sayin g th at

24

at all .

25

were n ot present in the Ramos case that make Ram os not

It is just that there are factors here that

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

3
4

controlling in this particular situation.
If Your Honor is positing the question whether
or not in the event that the Mississippi Supreme Court
in their infinite wisdom decided to permit comment on

5

non-review, I would first of all take the position that

6

it shouldn't be done by the prosecutor, and if it is

7

going to be done, as it was done in the Barnes case, it

8

is an instruction by the Court.

9

But that really is a hypothetical which has

10

been decided by the Mississippi Supreme Court which has

11

said, we don't want this statute to go to the jury.

12

that is the state of the law today in Mississippi by

13

virtue of cases which came after the Caldwell case.

14

So

Lastly, we would argue that under the Woodson

15

against North Carolina standard, the speculation here

16

and the remark by defense counsel simply diverted the

17

jury from considering the nature of the offense and the

18

individual characteristics of the offender, which really

19

are the true focus and the constitutional obligation of

20

a jury to consider.

21

We maintain that there was no invited error.

22

This Court decided the Young case.

23

was handed up.

24

that it made it clear that the invited reply theory as

25

far as prosecutorial argument is a response in kind, and

And

Just last week it

I respectfully submit to the Court

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

here there is simply no response in kind.

2
3

QUESTION?

Hr. Boyle, do you read Young as

being a constitutional decision?

4

MR. BOYLE:

I read it as -- we were dealing

5

with -- the Court was dealing with a federal prosecutor

6

in that case.

7

process clause.

8
9

QUESTION;

Does the opinion cite the due

process clause.

10

11

I believe they were dealing with the due

MR. BOYLE:
Honor,

I haven't got it with me, Your

but it dealt with --

12

QUESTION;

13

MR. BOYLE?

I didn't think it did.
I stand corrected.

One of the

14

arguments we are making here, and it comes in the third

15

part,

16

appropriate with regard to that aspect of the opinion,

17

but the point that I am trying to make here is that

18

there must be a response in kind, and I submit that

19

there is no response in kind here.

20

is dealing with plain error, which perhaps is more

What the court seized on, the majority seized

21

on in this case was that they had argued imprisonment

22

for the rest of his life.

23

actually -- he ussd the exact same term, and it is the

24

only statutory alternative that an attorney has to argue

25

to a jury, and I submit that that simply is not invited

Comments by the prosecutor

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

error,

and there is simply no response whatsoever

2
3
4

Lastly, with regard to this issue, this Court
decided Ebbits against Lucy last month, and we call that
to the Court's attention with regard to the respondent’s

5

argument that there is an adequate independent state

6

ground here for the decision.

7

I believe that under Lucy the failure by the

8

assigned appellate counsel in this case to claim this as

9

error would prevent the court,

the Mississippi Supreme

10

Court,

from reaching the merits with regard to that

11

issue,

and accordingly we submit that it is not an

12

adequate state ground, and that this Court should

13

consider the merits of the issue.

14

I would lastly point out on this issue that

15

the Mississippi Supreme Court in effect waived Rule 63

16

because they invited counsel prior to the argument to

17

address that issue in oral argument.

18

briefs on it, and in fact they did deliberate and reach

19

a decision on that issue.

20

They accepted

And so I think under Lucy and under just the

21

general law the adequacy of an independent state ground,

22

being itself a federal question, that should not be a

23

bar here.

24
25

QUESTION:

Do you think there was any

indication in Ebbits against Lucy, first of all, that it
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

extends to other experts other than the psychiatric

2

help,

3

indication in it that a state can't have a rule that

and secondly, do you think that there is any

says the defense has tc specify the cost in any event
and make the other showing that the state thinks would
be necessary?

7

HR. BOYLE:

I don’t see the applicability of

8

Ebbits at all.

9

into the second phase of our argument.

How, Justice O'Connor, we are getting
I only see

10

Ebbits against Lucy as bearing on the issue dealing with

11

whether or not there is an adequate state ground by

12

virtue of counsel's failure to comply with Rule 6B.

13

If I may go into the facts with regard to the

14

second issue under the Sixth Amendment, there was a

15

pretrial motion for a psychiatrist, a ballistics expert,

16

a fingerprint expert, and a criminal investigator.

17

request for a fingerprint expert in the Mississippi

18

Supreme Court below was treated as a request for an

19

expert with regard to the foot cast evidence, and I

20

would

21

the Mississippi Supreme Court to do so, I believe, in

22

their brief, and that has been the way the case has

23

proceeded.

The

urge this Court to do so, and the respondent urged

24

The order notes that the claim for all these

25

experts, including psychiatrists, was made in order to

(202) 628-9300

1

establish an adequate defense, and they appointed, the

2

Court appointed its own expert in the area of psychiatry

3

and then denied the application with regard to the other

4

experts, and they did so, and I quote, "based on recent

5

Mississippi cases," and that is a question as to what

6

they were referring to.

7

At the trial, these experts, there was a

8

ballistics expert called by the prosecution, and he

testified in assisting the government to make out their

There was cross e xamination which only really

further bolstered the claim with regard to the strength

prosecutor highlighted the ballistics testimony and then

20

he even went so far as to n ote to the jury that it stood

21

unimpe ached.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION ;

On summation, the

Wasn't this a case where there was

an eye witness?
ME. BOYLE;

There was an eye witness.

We

don’t suggest, Justice Behn quist, that there was not
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

other evidence in connection with the prima facie case.

2

There was an eye witness, and there was a glove that was

3

also found near the scene of the crime which had been

4
5

6

caught on a barbed wire fence.

There was also -- and

the matching glove was found in the defendant's
possession.

There was also a confession in the case.

7

However, we maintain that this is one of the

8

pieces that the prosecutor used to establish his prima

9

facie case.

The Mississippi Supreme Court with regard

10

to this issue sustained a request -- the denial on two

11

grounds, first, that under the United States

12

Constitution, defense was not entitled to these

13

services, and secondly, on the ground that they had

14

failed — that defense counsel had failed to itemize the

15

specific costs and the purpose and the value of these.

16

We respectfully submit to the Court that the

17

second ground deals with the state’s reimbursement

18

statute, which we maintain is inadequate on its face.

19

The respondent takes the position in this Court that he

20

doesn't seek to sustain the Court’s decision at all on

21

the constitutional issue.

22

concede that there is a due process right to experts in

23

this area.

They concede that, and they

24

I submit to the Court that that concession is

25

made in an effort to attack the petitioner’s case in an
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

area «(here they consider it to be weak and vulnerable,

2

namely, the failure to sufficiently specify costs.

3

However, we respectfully submit that because of the

4

statutory scheme and the unconstitutional -- the

5

inadequacies of that statutory scheme, that the

6

application cannot be fairly judged under that, and that

7

the case should be vacated and remanded.

8
9

QUESTION;

Nr. Boyle, is there anything in the

cases from this Court that you find that say a state

10

cannot require as prerequisite the appointment of any

11

expert --

12

NR. EOYLE;

13

QUESTION:

14
15

No, there is not.
-- witnesses that there be a

threshold showing of need and cost and so forth?
NR. BOYLE;

There is not.

Justice O'Connor,

16

the law in Mississippi, however, has never recognized a

17

due process constitutional right to these services.

18

QUESTION;

Why does it need to?

Maybe it

19

wants to offer them whether or not the Constitution

20

requires it, and if so, why can't they have a reasonable

21

rule requiring a threshold showing?

22

MR. BOYLE;

The problem here is that they are

23

construing -- let's say that there's a statutory right,

24

and that is what the respondent says here.

25

appropriate case, there is a statutory right under our

In an

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

reimbursement statute

2
3
4
5

6
7

8

First of all, that statute is being construed
from the point of view that there is no constitutional
right in this area.

Secondly, it is inadequate and

defective on its face for the following reasons.

First,

it doesn’t provide for an ex parte application, and
there are certain constitutional problems that arise
from that.

9

In other words, defense counsel, in order to

10

make this application, has to go to the judge on notice,

11

and this was done in this case, on notice to his

12

adversary, and say, I would like to call an expert in

13

this area.

14

They have to tip off their defense.
And there is no similar requirement for a

15

non-indigent to do it, and so we maintain that there is

16

an equal protection problem with that, because it is

17

creating a classification between indigents and

18

non -indigents.

19

In addition, under Wardius against Oregon,

20

which is the reciprocal alibi statute which the Court

21

considered, the Court said that under due process you

22

can’t have discovery on one hand and not reciprocal on

23

the other, and we submit that the government or the

24

state isn't obliged to make any --

25

QUESTION;

Aren’t requests by indigent for

counsel to represent them matters that are made with

2

notice to the other side?

3
4

HE. BOYLE*

I don't know if I understand ycur

guest i on.

5

QUESTION;

You said that the problem is that

6

there can't be an ex parte proceeding, and reguests by

7

an indigent for counsel aren’t done in an ex parte

8

setting.

9

MR. BOYLE*

That doesn't have to do with

10

secrets of the defense, or strategy of the defense is

11

probably a better terminology.

12

attorney is appointed for someone which under the law is

13

his constitutional right in no way indicates to the

14

government or to the state in this case what the

15

strategy of defense counsel may be at the trial.

16

The mere fact that an

However, when you come into court and you make

19

maybe he wants something that the state isn’t even going

to call, and he has got a good reason for it.

That is exactly what my point

There are two constitutional problems with it.

One is the Wardius against Oregon due process question
of non-reciprocal, and the other is the classification

8

that this creates, because any non-indigent can get any

9

expert that he wants.

10

QUESTION:

But your solution suggests that

11

perhaps to me your definition of the constitutional

12

right is overly broad,

13

to have a claim that I have to petition the court to get

14

experts, and the wealthy defendant doesn’t have to fool

15

around with a court at all, then the only answer is

16

because if the defendant is going

simply for the legislature to appropriate each year

17

about £5 or £10 million for whatever services criminal

18

defendants may want, and I dare say there aren’t many

19

courts that would sustain that sort of a claim.

20

MR. BOYLE;

Well, I call to the Court's

21

attention, Justice Rehnquist, the federal legislation in

22

this area, not that it is constitutionally mandated by

23

virtue of the fact that it comes from Congress,

24

obviously, but this has been interpreted, and I believe

25

that there are serious problems which arise if you are

going to make defense counsel in an indigent case tip

2

his hand and put his adversary on notice, this is the

3

very heart of our criminal justice system.

4

This Court went to great expense in the Crcnic

case to say that this adversary system is essential to

rooting out the facts, and if you are going to require

the value of experts in this area.

22

I acknowledge, as I have to, that perhaps in

23

retrospect if this application were redrafted, it could

24

be somewhat more specific, but I submit that that is not

a defect in this case, and if I could just make one

imposes the obligation on its face on defense counsel to

And that creates all kinds of problems,

because maybe defense counsel isn’t willing to risk the

ORAL ARGUMENT BY WILLIAM S.

15

BOYD, III, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16

MR. BOYD;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

17

please the Court,

18

summarize the state's position on the three issues that

19

have been raised in this matter.

20

of course, concerns the propriety of advising the jury

21

of a condemned prisoner's right of mandatory appellate

22

review.

23

initially I would like to briefly

The initial question,

State court resolution of this issue rested

24

upon two grounds.

25

substantive.

The first was procedural, the second

While we feel that the ultimate resolution
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

of the issue was based on independent and adequate state

2

ground s, that is, state procedural grounds, we shall

3

con cen trate our comments this morning upon the

4

substa ntive aspect of the issue.

5

Within this regard, while the Mississippi

6

Su prem e Court divided four to four over the state's

7

argume nt, it unanimously concluded that this Court’s

8

decisi on in California versus Bamos was the benchmark

9

from rf hich they must work, and that the ultimate

10
11

resclu tion of the issue was a question of state law.
The second, the denial of expert and

12

invest igative services, it is the state's position that

13

a def a ndant does not have a constitutional right tc

14

exper t or investigative assistance simply upon demand,

15

He mus t demonstrate to the trial judge that the services

16

regue s ted are both necessary and reasonable.

17

And as for the third question, the

18

con fro ntation issue, we note that there was no objection

19

to a p ortion of counsel's argument identified in the

20

briefs , and that the issue was not raised on direct

21

appeal in the Mississippi Supreme Court.

22

clear 1 y barred under state law, and we suggest that this

23

Court' s recent case in United States versus Young is

24

more o r less dispositive of the issue.

25

The issue is

Within this regard, we suggest that certiorari
26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

has be en improvidently granted on that particular issue,

2

Now , d irecting our comments to the closing argument

3

questi on, we note that in particular there was nothing

4

really per se objectionable to defense counsel's

5

com men ts during closing summation.

6

However, both the trial judge and the

7

assist ant district attorney were both of the opinion

8

that t he argument left the jury with the impression that

9

once a sentence of death was returned, nothing could be

10

done t o correct it.

11

a ssist ant district attorney termed it, that they were

12

going to take the defendant out the front door and

13

string him up at that point in time.

14

I believe the way that the

The Mississippi Supreme Court or this Court

15

has ba sically -- has consistently held that based upon

16

princi pies of comity and federalism, in particular the

17

case o f Donnelly v. DeChristoforo , review is limited to

18

det erm ine whether the arguments of counsel in state

19

cou rt cases render the trial so fundamentally unfair as

20

to den y the defendant due process.

21

Within this regard, we note three major points

22

that t his Court has in the past identified in questions

23

concer ning state court closing argument.

24

recent ly stressed in the recent case of United States

25

versus Yeung.

This was also

QUESTION.*

Nr. Boyd, may I ask you one

4

question that just occurred to me?

5

of the death -- capital punishment is often criticized

6

because of the great delay that elapses between the

7

imposition of the sentence and the carrying out of the

8

sente n ce.

9

The administration

Bo you think it would have been prejudicial to

10

the prosecutor if the jury had the impression that the

11

sentence would be carried out in a very short period of

12

time?

13
14

NR. BOYD;

I am not sure that I understand

your question, Your Honor.

15

QUESTION;

Apparently the response was needed,

16

as I understand kind of the preliminary comment you

17

made,

18

prosecutor's case if the jury thought they were going to

19

take him right out immediately and implement the

20

sentence.

21

because it might have been harmful to the

Is that your view, that the jury would have a

22

distorted view of the case and it would harm the

23

prosecutor to think that that sentence would be carried

24

out promptly?

25

MR. BOYD:

Your Honor, I am not so sure that
28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

it would have harmed the state's case.

I think what, in

2

my impression of reading the closing argument in this

3

case,

4
5

was that the state was simply trying to inform the

jury or advise the jury that death would not be
administered in an arbitrary and capricious fashion.

6

There was a good bit of discussion by state’s

7

counsel in this matter concerning the state of the law

8

prior to this Court’s decision in Furman v. Georgia,

9

that in essence what we had was an automatic imposition

10

of death with basically a mercy clause, that then the

11

state’s counsel went in and discussed this Court’s

12

decision in Furman, noting that the Court had found

13

those statutes that existed at that time were arbitrary,

14

that death was administered in a capricious fashion and

15

what not, then.

16

The Court came down — the state's attorney

17

noted that the legislature had undertaken to enact new

18

statutes dealing with this question in order to funnel

19

or to guide the jury’s discretion to take the arbitrary

20

aspects or the capricious aspects out of imposition of

21

death.

22

He then went into this Court's discussion or

23

this Court’s decision in Gregg v. Georgia and Proffiff

24

v.

25

his argument was that he stressed, and there are a

Florida, and one thing that I think is a key point to

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

number of instances in his closing argument where he

2

stressed that it was the jury’s determination that this

3

Court had made its decision in Gregg and Proffitt to the

4

effect that it was the jury who was to decide what the

5

particular or what the appropriate punishment would he

6

under the circumstances of the case within a channel of

7

guided discretion, as the Court has discussed.

8
9

QUESTIONi

But all of that just suggests tc me

that there was really no need to respond to what the

10

defense counsel said, that basically it was a jury

11

d ecision.

12

MR. BOYDi

From my reading of defense

13

counsel's closing argument, I got the distinct

14

impression, especially when they started talking about

15

the poem that was written by the prisoner in Georgia

16

prior to being executed, that in essence what defense

17

counsel was saying, he was trying to put the blood of

18

this man on the jury's hands, was in essence what they

19

were doing.

20

The argument that was given by defense counsel

in essence said, if you return this verdict, you are

going to kill the man.

QUESTION;

5

guilt-innocence phase at that particular time and were

6

in sentencing.

7

8
9

QUESTION;

But that would be all right,

wouldn * t it?
HR. BOYD;

Yes, of course, that is true, that

10

if a life sentence was returned, then of course no one

11

could execute him, but what -- our position in this

12

matter is this, that there are a line of cases,

13

particularly emanating from the state of Lousiana, cases

14

such as State v. Berry, State v. Matheson, State v.

15

Monroe, and this Court's decision is Naggio versus

16

Williams, wherein it was discussed a dichotomy more or

17

less or a dual system that they have developed in

18

lousiana, and that is where the closing argument is

19

addressed to dispelling in the jury's minds the guestion

20

of arbitrary imposition of death, then such-an argument

21

is appropriate under the circumstances.

22

QUESTION;

Well, do you concede that the state

23

in any event has no right to make an argument that is

24

misleading on the law?

25

HR. BOYD;

Oh, I think that's clearly what the
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

law is, that the state cannot make a misleading

a rgument.

QUESTION*.

All right.

So isn’t the real

question whether it was misleading or not?

Isn’t that

what we really hav» to focus on?

6

ME. BOYD*

Yes, ma’am, I think so, that --

7

QUESTION;

And the question there is whether

8

the prosecutor's remarks indicate that the jury's

9

verdict if they impose death will be automatically

10

reviewed in all its aspects?

11

ME. BOYD*

Well, I think there is a greater

12

question that we have to answer first, and that is

13

whether this is a matter of state law or whether or not

14

this is a matter of constitutional law.

15

I would invite the Court's attention to the

16

fact,

17

subsequent derisions to Caldwell dealing with this

18

particular issue by the Mississippi Supreme Court, that

19

of the case of Wiley v. State and the case of Williams

20

v . St a t e .

21

as Mr. Boyle commented on, that there had been two

In both of those cases as well as all eight

Within this regard, the question as to

diminished responsibilty, we suggest that this Court's

22

recent decision in Kainwright versus Witt and the

23

decision in Donnelly v. DeChristoforo mandates that

24

deference be given to the trial judge's determination as

25

to what was said.

1

The trial judge in this particular case felt

2

that defense counsel's closing arguments were misleading

3

to the jury, and instructed the assistant district

4

attorney basically to straighten the matter out, and

5

this is what he attempted to do, to address the question

6

as to whether or not the defendant would be taken out

7

the front of the courthouse and there summarily

8

executed .

9

A corollary to this is a case which is

10

currently pending before this Court on certiorari, the

11

case of Booker v. State, wherein defense counsel is the

12

one that got up at the initiation of the proceedings and

13

started talking about let's go ahead and sentence this

14

man to life, because we have all of these multiple

15

appeal si that we are going to go through in this

16

matter.

17

Likewise, in this particular case, defense

18

counsel discussed at great length this Court's decision

19

in Furman v. Georgia, and noted that the Assistant

20

District Attorney would probably address comments in

21

tha t direction.

22

So I think that we do have something here that

23

both the Mississippi Supreme Court in its supervisory

24

capacity and the lower trial court found not to be

25

particularly objectionable under the circumstances.

Addressing the second point in this matter/
the expert witness question, there are several things
that we need to, I suppose, straighten out in this.
There have been three recent decisions by the
Mississippi Supreme Court on this particular point.
Ruffin v. State, which is cited at length in our brief,
DuFcr v. State, and Billiot v.

State.

Billiot v. State gives a rather protracted
recounting of the histcry of this particular point in

10

the jurisprudence of the state of Mississippi.

11

Likewise, DuFor v. State recognizes the particular

12

special aspects that psychological or mental health

13

professionals play within the context of the criminal

14
15

proce?ding.
Historically speaking, Mississippi has

16

recognized the right of an indigent offender to expert

17

and investigative services.

18

that the determination of whether to provide such

19

services must be made on a case by case basis.

And it consistently held

20

Here, we would note in particular one thing

21

that I don't know has been made abundantly clear, and

22

that is that Mr. Caldwell did have the assistance cf a

23

psychiatrist in this matter appointed at state expense

24

to the tune of $7G per hour.

25

of Memphis, Tennessee.

That was Dr. Allen Battle

1

Not only did he have that , but prior to trill

2

he was sent to the Mississippi State Hospital at

3

Whitfield, where he was examined there by the staff at

4

the state hospital.

Apparently counsel chose not to use

5

these professionals that were given to him for these

6

particular purposes within this case.

7

Substantively speaking, and this is something

8

that the petitioner has attacked rather particularly

9

here, and that is Section 9915.17, the authorization for

10

retention of these services, Billiot v. State speaks to

11

the particular question as to whether or not this

12

statute is applicable, and found that it has been so.

13

However,

the court by judicial definition has

14

impressed upon the statutory authority the requirements

15

that the defendant on a motion to the court, one,

16

outline the specific cause that will be involved -- in

17

this case it was £70 an hour by Dr.

19

and three, the value of the proposed testimony of the

defendant.

22

several things.

24

or who he wanted retained as a ballistics expert.

there the court was confronted with a situation where

One was that defense counsel never told

So

there was no indication as to what witness expert the

2

defend ant wanted in this regard.

4

I think, that within the overall constitutional
contex t, and while I often times do not agree with this

5

organi zation, I find myself agreeing with it in this

6

par tic ular case, and that is the American Civil

7

Libert ies Union, in their brief to this Court in the

8

case o f Eit v. Oklahoma.

9

And Footnote 22 of their brief in that

10

partic ular matter I think adequately summarized what the

11

law wa s.

12

should be made available to indigent defendants on

13

demand , or that the Constitution requires the state to

14

provid e indigents with the same quantum of assistance

15

that a millionarie might choose to mobilize for his

16

def ens e.

But can't the defendant say that if

22

a state has sufficient doubt about the other evidence

23

that it is going to call a ballistics expert that the

24

defendant is entitled to call one, too?

25

MR. BOYD:

No, sir.

I don't think that that

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

is a proper standard.

The Eleventh Circuit in

which say that where the state has expert witnesses

to trial, and things of this nature, and where there is

9

of some significance, and may necessitate the

appointment of additional experts.

11

But unless we are dealing with a crucial point

12

of evidence, that is, where it is the pivotal point cf

13

evidence within the case, I do not think that the

14

Constitution mandates that such an expert be appointed

15

for defense counsel purposes.

16

Likewise on the investigative assistance

17

question, we note that under the Criminal Justice Act,

18

there is a $150 maximum ceiling placed on investigative

19

services.

20

the Criminal Justice Act has recommended to this Court

21

that such services be sparingly used, and that they be
