MARCUS:

Hr.

Chief Justice, may it pleas

7

the Court, the issue presented for review this afternoon

8

is, must the defendant

9

in order to preserve his right to appeal an erroneous

give up his right not to testify

10

ruling by the trial court admitting a prior conviction

11

under

Fule 609A of the Eederal Rules of Evidence?
The context in which this case arcse is by way

12

13

of a motion in limine filed in the United States

14

District Ccurt in Memphis.

15

firmly indicated a desire to testify in his defense.

In his motion,

the defendant

The issue was briefed, and the relevant case

16
17

law cited to the ccurt.

After argument, both the

18

government and defendant moved for a ruling.

19

court definitively held that a defendant may testify on

20

the issue of flight, absent impeachment by way of the

21

prior

conviction.
However, if the defendant were to testify cn

22

23

any substantive issues in the case, the evidence of the

24

prior

25

conviction cculd then be admitted against birr.
The rationale behind the court's ruling was

•p

1

simply that the eailir ccnvact acn , first, involved 3

crime

felony .

cf moral turpitude, and secondly, that it was a

MR.

8

MARCUS:

Actually,

He did not.

your client didn't

That is correct,

sir .
QUESTION;

9

Wouldn't it be better to say the

10

trial court said it then, since the trial court wasn't

11

applying its rule to any particular set of facts that

12

was before it?
MR. MARCUS;

13
14

The ruling, however, was

definitive before the ccnciusicn of the defense case.
QUESTION;

15

I don't doubt that it was

16

definitive,

tut I just thinking holding is not -- a

17

holding is -- I think cf a legal rule applied to

18

specific facts.

19

finally made up its mind.

I don't doutt that

HR. MARCUS;

20

the trial court had

After the defendant was

21

convicted,

22

raised the issue of the earlier conviction being

23

improperly

24
25

post-trial motions in this matter once again

admitted as impeachment.
And again, the trial court ruled, this time in

a written opinion, that the previous conviction was a

4

1

felony

involving moral turpitude, and therefore world be

2

proper impeachment in this case.
Cn appeal, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals

3
4

affirmed the conviction, stating in part that, since the

5

defendant had failed to testify and suffered the

6

impeachment, he could net new complain of error.
In the case, the defendant should not have

7
8

been required to waive his constitutional right to

9

remain

silent in orde to preserve a ruling which is

10

patently wrong.

The right to remain silent or to

11

testify is a fundamental right of all defendants.

12

is, more importantly, a personal right to each

13

defendant.

It

It would stretch the doctrine of waiver teyond

14
15

its limits to suggest that a defendant faced with these

16

facts,

that being an erroneous ruling of the trial

17

court,

a ruling which certainly will impact on his

18

decision whether or net to take the witness stand to

19

testify, cannot --

QUESTION:

What if the trial court had

declined to rule on the defendant's motion in limine/

2

and had just said well, I don't know if I'll consider

3

this or not, and had just let it ride?

4

I guess that, in turn,

would have affected the

5

defendant's decision whether to testify or not,

it?

7

ME. MARCUS:

QUESTION:

judge's decision not to rule on the motion in limine?

Sc you think a trial court must

ME. MARCUS;

15

Your Honor,

yes.

Otherwise,

16

there would be no- purpose in the rule if he did not or

17

would

ret entertain the motion.
As an example, the rule is there for a.

18
19

purpose.

Rule 609A, as the Court is familiar with, is

20

there for a purpose and I believe the Court must indeed

21

decide at some point in time certainly, the motion in

22

limine in this context.
QUESTION;

23

I suppose I have been laboring

24

under

the impression at least that most trial courts

25

treat it as a discretionary matter with the

6

trial court,

1

and as merely a tentative ruling, and

2

definitive in any event.
ME. MARCUS;

3

not one that's

Well, I believe, as I had

4

indicated earlier,

that it should be decided.

5

in looking to the specific facts of this case, which we

6

subnit are important here, the court did rule and it was

7

a definite ruling, and it was made before the defendant

8

did testify.
Ycur suggestion, of course,

9

raises a different

-- or perhaps somewhat different issue than

presented here today.

arose at the last possible moment prior to the

Indeed, if the defendant were coerced to

court.

MR. MARCUS:

That is correct.
Ard what did the trial court do?
The trial court, at the time of

the trial court indeed did rule on the motion,

15

and indeed indicated that if the defendant were to

16

testify, the impeachment could he admitted -- that being

17

the impeachment by way of prior conviction.
We submit that there was not even an attempt

18
19

at balancing under the Rule 609A which is required, and

20

the court ruled patently wrong in its metier., on the

21

motion

in limine.
QUESTION:

22

Well, in the next case, I suppose

23

under the Court of Appeals opinion, a trial court will

never need to rule on the motion unless he says he*s

ME. MARCUS;

Well, what’s wrong with that?
Well, we indicate that we feel it

MR. MARCUS;

When you say it's unique, isn't it

true that 99-44/100 percent of the defendants that don't

Okay.
At least if I clarify that.
Okay.

Well, I don't think it's that

other situations, more violent types of crimes, bank

going to tender, because presumably decision as to

Could the court make a better or

SR. MARCUS;

Well, again, in this case, the

14

district court did not feel it needed that information.

15

It felt it had sufficient information to make the

16

ruling, absent the defendant's testimony.

17

I think this would be, again, a rather harsh

18

rule to adopt, for this Court to adopt;

19

require the defendant, as the Sixth Court cf Appeals

20

does, take the the stand and wait for the court's ruling

until the cross-examination.

And I would

like tc suggest that the facts cf this case show vividly

3

why that rule is an appropriate one in these

circum stances.
Petitioner made his motion in limine on the

5
6

second

day of trial, before the government had rested,

7

while the government was still putting on its case.

8

Petitioner stated in the motion that he intends tc

11

Moreover, the very fact that the district

testify to in determining hew it would rule on the

14

motion, demonstrates that the court was, in fact,

15

applying the balancing test that is required under Fule

16

609, and it demonstrates a

17

rule as well; that the court cannot make its final

That’s true.

QUESTION;

13

sometimes actually happens, during the motion in limine,
