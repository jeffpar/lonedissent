ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES ALVIN MILLER, ESQ.,

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. MILLER:

6
7

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case presents questions as to the meaning

8
9

Mr. Miller, you may

of terms in the Medicaid law, and the State of

10

Connecticut is grateful for the Court for hearing its

11

case today.
The outcome of this case is unusually

12
13

important because of its bearing on the future care of

14

needy mentally ill in the United States, and because of

15

its impact on the states and their position as partners

16

with the federal government in carrying out the Medicaid

17

program.
Two statutory terms must be construed in this

18
19

case.

The first is the term "institution for mental

20

diseases," which I will refer to as IMD.

21

exception in the statute that limits the coverage that

22

otherwise would be extended for certain medical services.

23

The second term is "intermediate care

That is an

24

facility," or ICF.

This is one category of facility

25

that is covered by the Medicaid program, and it is
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

defined in the statute to mean a facility that provides

2

a specified level of service to persons requiring it

3

because of their mental or physical condition.

4

And the ultimate question presented is the

5

extent to which, if at all, the IMD exception limits

6

Medicaid coverage for ICFs.

7

The briefs of the parties have treated

that

8

question exhaustively,

9

complexity of the Medicaid laws and the subtlety of many

10

11

and in so doing have exposed the

of its standards and distinctions.
QUESTION*

May I inquire about the

12

consequences of a ruling adverse to your position?

13

the Government is correct In its view of this statute,

14

would it be possible for states to simply scatter mental

15

patients around among the intermediate care facilities

16

and just not put as many of them in a single facility,

17

as existed here, and succeed in having reimbursement by

18

that device?

19

MR. MILLERi

Yes, Justice O’Connor, from the

20

point of view of the mentally ill that would be the

21

principal consequence.

22

QUESTION;

Yeah.

And so we're not really

23

talking about the money so much as the inconvenience

24

perhaps of having to scatter them?

25

MR. MILLER:

If

I wouldn’t call it

would he given to mentally ill people.

3

shows in this case, because Middletown Haven was

4

recognized by everyone involved as being a very fine

5

facility, a facility that specializes in the care of

6

people with mental conditions, it does a much better job

7

for them, even at this intermediate level,

8

facility which is treating people for a broad range of

9

conditions,

The principal impact is on the care that

11

care, albeit not the intensive care of hospitals.

12

some sort of residential

So that is a major distinction,

and the

13

evidence has shown that in this facility and others like

14

it that specialize in the care of the mentally ill,

15

those people get the kind of care they need and

16

cannot get elsewhere.

17

QUESTION.:

they

What do you know about the

18

practical application of the Government's test?

19

look to see whether 50 percent or more of the patients

20

are mental cases, or 30 percent, or how is that being

21

applied in your experience?

22

MR. MILLER;

Do they

Well, we have the experience of

23

the present case and the three companion cases that

24

started out with them at the administrative level.

25

there are some other cases that are working their way

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

And

1

through the system new.

2

The answer is that, to begin with, the

3

Government has applied a 50 percent litmus test.

4

a number of other standards as well that it seeks to

5

apply.

6

whether the facility in guestion is functioning as an

7

alternative to the care of persons in mental hospitals.

8

And that's one of the points I wanted to make in the

9

argument this morning, that that set of criteria is

It has

All of those standards are designed to find out

10

fundamentally flawed in the sense that it looks to apply

11

a distinction contrary to what the statute applies.

12

as I will try to say later,

13

statute here which I am going to refer to, specifically

14

the Long amendment, was designed to encourage the

15

development of alternatives to mental hospitals and to

16

provide funding for the care of people who are placed in

17

these alternatives to the extent the alternative types

18

of facilities are covered by the statute.

19

And

the whole point of the

Not all alternatives to mental hospitals are

20

covered by the Medicaid program.

21

alternative is send someone home and have care in the

22

home or in a community-type facility.

23

alternatives are covered by Medicaid, and nursing homes,

24

either at the skilled level or the intermediate care

25

level, are two that are covered.

The most common

But some

(202) 628-9300

1

statute makes fairly evident that that is exactly the

2

way Congress wanted people who are mentally ill to be

3

treated where appropriate.

4

I said at the outset that the statute was

5

complex, and it is.

purpose of the provisions that are under

10

consideration in this case.

11

there are two general propositions that have a central

12

bearing on the case that I would like to make.

13

And in that connection

The first is that contrary to the position

14

taken by the court below and by the Department of Health

15

and Human Services in its briefs here, Congress has not

16

broadly excluded the mentally ill from the benefits of

17

public assistance under the Social Security Act

18

programs, by which I refer tc Medicaid and the financial

19

assistance programs that preceded it in the statute.

20

It is not true that the mentally ill as a

21

class were left solely to the states for aid in meeting

22

their basic subsistence and health needs.

23

ill, if they satisfy the tests for financial eligibility

24

categorical membership, have always gualified for the

25

financial assistance provided by the act.

The mentally

That, includes

1

not only the elderly mentally ill/ but also the mentally

2

impaired when the statute was amended in 1950 to provide

3

assistance for those who were disabled.

4

separate Medical Assistance Program for the Aged

5

adopted in

6

Medicaid -- the elderly mentally ill, like others who

7

qualified as needy, were eligible for payment of their

8

services such as doctors, hospital services, and clinic

9

services, and drugs and all the other items listed in

And when the
was

1960 -- that's the immediate precursor to

10

the statute, and that carried over into the Medicaid law

11

which was enacted in 1965.

12

Now,

there was an exemption -- an exception, I

13

should say, to this eligibility for federa1ly-suppcrted

14

assistance.

15

institution for mental disease, IMD, was not eligible

16

for any of the services that I described.

17

that exception is the issue to be decided here.

18

this brief review that I have just given of the other

19

forms of assistance that are available under the law,

20

including medical assistance available to the mentally

21

ill, should show that the scope of the IMD exception

22

cannot be decided by an assumption that Congress

23

intended to treat the mentally ill as solely a state

24

r esponsibility.

25

Beginning in

1950, a resident in an

assumption.

2

and of the Department here cannot substitute for an

3

objective analysis of the intended scope of the IVD

4

exception.

5

And the contrary premise of the court belcw

And so the absence of a broad policy to

6

exclude the mentally ill from the benefits of the public

7

assistance program leads me to my second general

8

proposition, which is that the IMD exception is a

9

facility specific limitation predicated not only on cost

10

concerns, but also upon a deep hostility to state mental

11

hospitals.

12

By mid-century these enormous and remote and

13

often demeaning institutions were broadly perceived as

14

the antithesis of how the mentally ill should be treated

15

in this country, and the animus towards these facilities

16

was reflected in the -- many ways, including the seminal

17

report of the Joint Commission on Mental Illness and

18

Health that we’ve referred to in our brief.

19

study that was commissioned by the Congress, and which

20

was reported in 1960, and which was followed by the

21

principal legislation that is before the Court today.

22

That’s the

So by the time the Medicaid law was enacted in

23

1965, there was a clear consensus, not only in the

24

Congress but also in the profession and the best

25

thinking around the country that state mental hospitals

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

as they then existed were outmoded, and that successful

2

care of the mentally ill depended upon the development

3

of mere suitable facilities and treatment techniques.

4

And that's the setting in which the IMD provisions of

5

the Medicaid law were adopted.

6

Now, with those two general propositions as

7

background, let me turn to the specifics of the task at

8

hand today, starting with the words of the statute.

9

acknowledge that the I HD exception is not expressly

All

10

defined in the statute, but the statutory terms do tell

11

us enough to resolve this case, because the IMD

12

exception was part of a group of provisions that have

13

beccne known as the Long amendment.

14

includes the exception to the exception that permits

15

coverage in IEDs, in mental hospitals for the elderly,

16

those over 65 years of age.

17

Medicaid was adopted in 1965.

18

also includes certain conditions that attach to that new

19

coverage, and most specifically, there is the

20

requirement that the states who opt for such coverage

21

adopt comprehensive plans for the care of the mentally

22

ill, and the statute specifically lists nursing homes as

23

one of the alterna tives to IMDs that are to be

24

considered and enc ouraged.

25

designa tion , it's Section 1396(a)(A)(21).

with numbers like that is necessarily complex.
And it is -- but that statute is strong proof

3

that on its face, the Congress did not intend the term

4

IKD to include nursing homes.

5

Now, the Department in its briefs points to

6

parenthetical clauses in the listing of covered services

7

in the statute to support its claim that the IKD

8

exception goes beyond mental hospitals and embraces

9

other types of facilities, specifically skilled nursing

10

homes and intermediate care facilities, and it’s the

11

latter that's involved in this case.

12

We’ve shown in our brief that these

13

parenthetical clauses are to skilled nursing or

14

intermediate care levels of service, and that

15

distinction is very critical.

16

do, to that type of service when offered in a mental

Mr. Miller, do you think you should

win the case if you can show that your reading is the

better reading, or is the only reading that is possible?

21

MB. MILLER;

Justice White, I'm familiar with

22

the doctrine of deference, to which I think you're

23

alluding, and I suppose if this were a 51-49 case we’d

24

have some deference on the scales for the Government

25

which would made our case more difficult.

25

What we've tried to do is not only analyze the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

specific language of the wording of the statute here»

2

but also try to understand what was the Congress getting

3

at here, what were the concepts and the purposes and the

4

meaning behind this collection of words, three or four

5

pages of one that consists of one sentence in the

6

statute.

7

And when you conclude that analysis, we think

8

it’s not a close case, evan just on the meanina of the

9

term IMD, which is all I'm focusing on right now.

10

QUESTION;

So you think the Court should just

11

make its own independent -- take its own independent

12

look at the statute and figure out what it means without

13

regard to what the agency says.

14

MR. MILLER;

I don't think the Court would

15

ever construe the statute without regard to what the

16

agency says.

In fact, much of our argument --

13

Not disregard

Yes.

In both cases after

Medicaid's original enactment of 1965.

20

I wanted to complete the point I was making

21

about the parenthetical clauses in the definitions of

22

hospital, skilled nursing and intermediate care services

23

of the statute, because that's what the Government

24

relies upon most.

25

The Department says that our view of the
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

statute, Connecticut's view, doesn't give effect to all

2

the words of the statute, and particularly those words.

3

We think it's the Department's view that is subject to

4

that criticism, because its reading of these

5

parenthetical clauses makes them redundant of the IMD

6

exception that appears at the end of the listing of all

7

these services.

8

those parenthetical clauses mean the same thing as the

9

general IMD exception that comes at the end.

10

According to the Department's view,

That's not what was meant by the Congress, and

11

it's relatively clear when one reads the legislative

12

record what was meant by those parenthetical clauses.

13

They were not in the lists of services in the original

14

Medical Assistance for the Aged Program, the precursor

15

to Medicaid, that was adopted in 1960, nor were they in

16

the house version of the Medicaid law that was enacted

17

in 1965.

18

President Johnson referred to as the great breakthrough

19

in the establishment of national health programs in this

20

country.

7

They were clearly not covered

That’s correct.
And I guess they weren’t covered by

MR. MILLER:

The

Just when did

'67 amendment provided that

8

financial assistance could be provided to residents of

9

intermediate care facilities, so that if a person

QUESTION:

That was the aged, blind and

disabled, wasn’t it?
MR. MILLER:

Yeah.

Then they would be covered

even though they were resident in those facilities.
In 1971 those facilities were brought under

17

Medicaid in a category of service, a category of medical

18

service described as intermediate care facility

19

services, was brought under the statute which wasn’t

20

there before.

21

23

QUESTION:

But are you contending that the

coverage here was created in 1971?
MR. MILLER:

Yes, sir, Justice Stevens.

It

was 1971, because the coverage that’s at issue here is

Hell, maybe I'm -There was a '72 amendment, but

9

The clauses in question -- and I'll try to

10

finish up on these clauses — they were added by the

11

Senate Finance Committee the same place where the

12

proposal to cut back on the IMD exception was initiated,

13

and the Senate report explains those clauses.

14

that they were put in to make clear that the new type cf

15

service that was being authorized for people over 65 in

16

IMDs was not mandatory.

17

It was only optional.

18

because otherwise, under the statute, hospital and.

skilled nursing services are mandatory.

wording of the statute and the regulations, the

legislative record which we've tried to spell out in cur

to this we add the other side of the story:

There's no reason not to give full scope to
1

the statutory definition of ICFs,

for that was the

2

intent of Congres.

The Senate Finance Committee, which

3
4

initiated the Medicaid amendment to cover ICFs, made
clear the intent.

Its report states that the ICF

5

provision was for people who would otherwise have to he
6

cared for in the higher cost and higher level skilled
7

nursing homes or in mental hospitals.

That was the

8

clear statement that means that Medicaid was intended to
9

cover people in ICFs who otherwise would be in IMDs.
10

Mental hospitals are clearly IMDs.
11

And I just don't think it’s sensible that
12

Congress meant that ICFs were to be used to cover people
13

with mental conditions, but only if they don’t
14

specialize in that type of care.
15

Middletown Haven did care for these people and
16

did so well.

It specialized in the treatment of mental

17

conditions, but it wasn't a psychiatric facility, and
18

when the conditions of the residents became sufficiently
19

severe, they had to be returned to the mental hospitals,
20

and they were in substantial number whenever that was
21

called for.

But Middletown Haven is exactly the kind of

22

facility that was contemplated by Congress when the
23

Medicaid program was expanded to take in ICFs in 1971.

The statutory language we think clearly

supports the Secretary as well as the common sense

aspect of the facts of this case.

Mr. Miller has pointed out, is repeated in several

7

parenthetical phrases in Section 1396(a) -- excuse me —

1396(d)(A) in about five different places in that

section.

The IMD exclusion, as

The exclusion appears not just after the

10

provision relating to inpatient hospital services, which

11

is where you would expect it to appear and only where

12

you would expect it to appear if we were talking simply

about mental hospitals, but it also appears in the

section following the definition of skilled nursing

of the same part of the statute.

Connecti cut’s answer to this parenthetical

to absurd results.

if ICF services are provided in a freestanding ICF, a

To us and to the court of appeals that's an

irrational, artificial distinction that finds absolutely

no support in the legislative history.

QUESTION;

I'm puzzled by the first example,

5

because the end of the section — there's one definition

6

of -- I don't know what it is -- intermediate care

8

institution or distinct part thereof for mental diseases

I'd like to use my remaining time to address

Thank you.

some cf Connecticut's policy arguments.

9

doesn't really rely on the statute.

Connecticut

Instead, what

10

they're relying on is extensive legislative history that

11

shows a auite sincere and detailed concern on the part

12

of Congress for the elderly and for the health costs,

13

both mental and nonmental,

of the elderly.

14

We find it somewhat hard to believe that

15

Congress would have devoted as much time as it did

16

and it was a lot -- to discussing the health problems

17

and costs of the elderly and then, without uttering a

18

single word, extend virtually the same coverage to the

19

patients in the age group we're talking about here,

20

between the ages of 21 and 64.

21

We also,

--

I might mention as an aside, find it

22

somewhat ironic that for Connecticut to rely on this

23

legislative history relating to the elderly, because

24

Congress made coverage in mental institutions optional

25

with the states, even for those over 65.

they’re in a different medical category than the

2

mentally ill.

3

Connecticut is asking this Court to take for it, and we

4

think that that decision is one that properly belongs to

5

Congress.

6

-- and we are not in this case talking about the $1

7

million disallowance at issue for Connecticut; we're

8

talking about the future cost of all states who might

9

seek reimbursement under this program in the future.

Put Congress hasn't taken the step that

And in light of the cost we're talking about

10

And I can't give a dollar amount on that,

11

clearly quite substantial.

12

QUESTION;

but it's

Do you suppose -- I take it, then,

13

you don't think there's room in this statute for the

14

Department to take a different view, to take

15

Connecticut's view?

16

MS. OBERLY:

1/2

No,

Your Honor,

I don't.

I think

17

that when faced with the facts that it has before it

18

that the only fiscally responsible position for the

19

Department to take in order to carry out Congress’

20

intent is the position it's taken, because Congress has

21

been throughout, it repeatedly said that it viewed the

22

cost of longterm care for the mentally ill as a state

23

responsibility.

24

step, but it hasn't taken the step that Connecticut is

25

asking the Court to take.

And it's chipped away at that step by

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

So that I think the agency would be running

2

contrary to years of congressional intent of assuming

3

that this was a state fiscal responsibility if it were

4

to take Connecticut's position.

5

Also, I think it’s quite significant that just

6

last summer, the summer of 1984, Congress looked at the

7

very provisions of

8

Every place that the parenthetical exclusion for

9

institutions for mental diseases appears in the statute

10

there previously also appeared an exclusion for

11

In 1984 Congress removed the TB exclusion.

13

part.

And so to

But when Congress examined that very same

22

23

think again that that's another strong indication that

unless and until Congress says something different about

25

the Secretary's interpretation, the Court should uphold

it

2

One final point is that extending coverage to

3

the group we're talking about here, the mentally ill

4

between 21 and 6b in ICFs and skilled nursing

5

facilities, would be particularly inappropriate because

6

when Congress has extended mental health coverage, it’s

7

done so with strict cost and therapeutic efficiency

8

controls.

9

the mentally retarded it's written into the statutes

For the elderly and for the children and for

10

provisions that require that those patients be getting

11

effective treatment, that those patients be getting

12

treatment that's designed to lead to their eventual

13

release and return to community living.

14

There are no such standards for the patients

15

that Connecticut seeks to bring within the scope of

16

Kedicaid coverage.

17

patients in ICFs and in skilled nursing facilities, but

18

none that pertain specifically to mental illness.

19

with Congress* unquestioned concern for cost

20

effectiveness, it seems to us highly unlikely that it

21

would have intended this sort of open-ended coverage for

22

the group Connecticut is talking about without also

23

providing the same cost effective and treatment-oriented

24

standards that it's provided for the other groups that

we all agree are covered by the statute.
