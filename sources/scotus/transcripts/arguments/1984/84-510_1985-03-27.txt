CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD MELVYN COOPER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

ME. COOPER:

6
7

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court;
The central question in this case is whether

8
9

Mr. Cooper, I think you

under Section 2 of the Sherman Act a firm with monopoly

10

power has a duty to cooperate with a smaller rival ty

11

participating in a horizontal arrangement for joint

12

marketing.

13

case is shaped by two additional material facts.

14

The question in the circumstances of this

First, the firm with monopoly power here,

15

Aspen Ski Company, was not vertically integrated, but

16

rather operated at only one level of the skiing

17

industry, and therefore cases such as Terminal Railroad,

18

Kodak, and Otter Tail are readily distinguishable.

19

case involves no vertical element.

20

This

Secondly, the conduct at issue here, Ski

21

Company's refusal to cooperate with Aspen Highlands, was

22

decided on and carried cut by Ski Company independently

23

and not as part of any group, contract, combination, or

24

conspiracy, and thus, under the distinction between

25

independent action and concerted action reaffirmed by

(202) 628-9300

1

this Court last term in Monsanto and in Copperweld, what

2

we have here is clearly independent conduct, not

3

concerted conduct.
In these circumstances, we submit the answer

4
5

to the question presented is no, that no firm, not even

6

one with monopoly power, has a duty under the antitrust

7

laws to engage in horizontal joint marketing

8

arrangements.
Although voluntary horizontal arrangements

9
10

between competitors sometimes have pro-competitive

11

aspects and are consistent with the goals of the

12

antitrust laws and therefore pass muster under Section

13

1 's rule of reason, mandatory horizontal arrangements

14

imposed by law and enforced and administered by courts

15

have never had any place in the jurisprudence of

16

antitrust.
QUESTION;

17
18

arrangement would involve price-fixing, too, I suppose?
NR. COOPER;

19
20
21

Well, the joint marketing

Price-fixing would be per se

unlawful.
QUESTION;

Well, I know, but isn't that part

22

of the kind of a joint marketing arrangement you're

23

talking about?

24

HR. COOPER;

Well, some joint market -- I said

prices?

7

MB. COOPER;

8

In the 95 years since the enactment of the

9

It does indeed.

Sherman Act, this Court has never held or suggested that

10

any duty of horizontal cooperation exists or should

11

exist, and until the decision by the Tenth Circuit belcw

12

no Court of Appeals in the 95 years of the statute had

13

ever sc held.

14

Thus, the decision below is unprecedented, and

15

we submit is unwarranted on the facts of this case and

16

is indeed directly contrary to the central goals of the

17

antitrust laws.

18

The principal facts are relatively

19

straightforward.

The product market involved here is

21

markets, one embracing all of North America and

22

including all of the firms that cater to destination

23

skiiers, those who travel a substantial distance to a

24

25

who spend a substantial amount of time, generally at

The jury also found a sub-market consisting cf

For a number of years, each of the two firms

needs of different skiiers.

9

exhibits, Exhibit 15 and 47

And if you examine the
that show the history of the

10

ticket offerings and prices of the two firms, you will

11

see that there has been considerable experimentation.

12

The specific kinds of tickets offered have varied from

13

year to year and the pricing interrelationships among

14

the tickets have varied from year to year.
The court below placed some reliance on the

15
16

fact that shortly before trial Ski Company announced a

17

prospective increase in its daily lift ticket price from

18

$18 to $22 per day.

19

That's not the largest one-year increase shown in the

20

record of this case.

21

Highlands increased its ticket price 25 percent in cne

22

swoop.

23

That was a 22 percent increase.

From 1977-'78 to *78-*79,

MR. COOPER;

2

QUESTION;

No, counsel did not.
Did not, okay.

And do you contend

3

now that the instruction was somehow wrong or that the

4

evidence was insufficient?

5

MR. COOPER;

We contend the evidence was

6

insufficient.

7

our view of the case, you would never have reached the

8

qivinq of instructions.

9

We do not challenge the instructions.

QUESTION;

On

Was there some evidence that Aspen

10

Ski Company refused to accept the Adventure Pack coupons

11

that were equivalent to cash simply because they were

12

issued by a competitor?

13

MR. COOPER:

14

QUESTION;

15

Yes.
And would that be enough evidence,

then, to get to the jury on the Section 2 issue?

16

MR. COOPER;

17

QUESTION;

18

MR. COOPER;

I would submit not.
Why not?
Because the premise on which that

19

evidence would go to the jury is that there is a duty

20

under Section 2 to engage in horizontal joint marketing

21

arrangements with a competitor.

22

of law there is no such duty and therefore the refusal

23

to accept the coupons issued by a competitor could not

24

support a finding of a Section 2 violation.

25

QUESTION;

We submit as a matter

ticket, that it was a substitute offered by Highlights;

is that correct?
HR. COOPER;

That's correct.

It was issued

facilities and to Ski Company's facilities.

QUESTION:

At the regular retail price?

2

NR. COOPER;

I think that's a fair inference,

although it's not absolutely clear what price they were

offering.

I read it as the retail price.
But in any event, Ski Company would

QUESTION:

MR. COOPER;

That's correct.
At the retail price?
That's correct.

And its evident

reason for its refusal to do so was that it wanted tc

alleged between Ski Com pany and a reservation service.

QUESTION*

Were there separate verdicts on

ME. COOPER*

No, but there was a separate

allegation related to both.

a Section 1 violation.
QUESTION*

But does that necessarily foreclose

14

the possibility that they relied on that evidence as

15

evidence of exclusionary conduct?

16

MR. COOPER;

I would think so in this case.

I

17

would think we’re entitled to all of the fair inferences

18

that would arise from that verdict.

19

QUESTION;

20

verdicts in the criminal law.

22

You know, we have inconsistent

MR. COOPER*

You don't think we could

I don’t think you have an

The second element of the six, the third one

3

mentioned, was the advertising, and our submission on

4

that is it's de minimus and indeed insufficient as a

5

matter of law.

6

All of these other four — the refusal to

7

continue the joint ticket, the offering of the

8

competitive three-area ticket, the refusal to accept the

9

coupons, and the announcement of the prospective price

10

increase, which were the other four elements cited ly

counsel in closing argument and relied on by the Court

of Ap peals -- all are subsum abl e, as th e Court of

MR. COOPER;

2

Well, that's the argument made in

3

counsel's brief, in Highlands' brief in this Court.

As

4

it was presented -- and I'll address both.

5

presented to the jury and relied on by the Court of

6

Appeals, it was simply that there was a large increase

7

in the one-day price, this 22 percent increase, and

8

given the economics of Highlands* Adventure Pack, it

9

made the Adventure Pack uneconomical.

As it was

And our submission is that a firm in setting

10

its own prices does not have to take into account, as a

12

matter of law does not have to take into account, the

13

needs of a horizontal competitor.

opposite and left the single ticket price alone and

23
24
25

MR. COOPER;

Yes, that a firm has no duty to

deal with a horizontal competitor.

Our position is that the purpose of every firm that

engages in competition is to prevail in competition, and

at the level of intent, intent alone, there's no

That’s correct.
Mr. Cooper, I agree, I think, with

most of what you say about antitrust law.

12

how we got around the jury’s findings in this case?

13

16

have thought that’s a perfectly absurd finding, but the

jury found it, and CA-10 said there was evidence to

support it.

19

it seems absurd to have a market that narrow.

20

With all the other mountains in that area,

The jury also found that Petitioner had

21

monopoly power in the sub-market, and CA-10 found there

22

was evidence to support that.

found that Petitioner willfully used its monopoly power

24

to exclude the Respondent from the market.

Now, I take it, in response to a question from

one of the other Justices, you said your position

2

basically is that those findings were contrary to the

evidence.

4

and make a decision as to whether or not they were

5

contrary to the evidence?

Does that mean we must review the evidence

MR. COOPER*

6

Well, in form you have to review

7

the evidence.

In substance the task is much easier,

8

because the only evidence, we submit, that could

9

possibly support the jury verdict that isn't de minimus

10

is the evidence of failure to cooperate in various

11

ways .

12

And we submit that there is no duty under

13

Section 2 as a matter of law why that evidence should

14

even go to the jury, but even taking that evidence as

15

established fact, it doesn't amount to an antitrust

16

violation; that there is no duty to accept your

17

competitor's coupons for entry into your own facilities;

18

that there's no duty to have a joint ticket with your

19

competitor; and that there's no duty to sell your

20

tickets to your competitors so that he can package them

21

with his own tickets to get tag-along purchases of his

22

own tickets.

23

And if the Court launches on a new duty tc

OP ft L ARGUMENT OF

8

TUCKFR KARL TRAUTMAN, ESQ.,

9

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. TRAUTMAN:

10
11

Mr.

Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case, decided by the jury originally and

12
13

affirmed by the Tenth Circuit, does not create a duty to

14

cooperate.

15

having to decide here is to review the jury's findings.

16

That is, whether or not there was sufficient evidence,

17

including all of the conduct that was presented at

18

trial, to find that Petitioner's conduct, including its

19

refusals to deal and its other actions that are noted,

20

constituted monopolization.

21
22
23

Instead, the issue that you find yourselves

That was the issue.

Two points I'd like to

make in this argument:
One, because of the lack of evidence below

24

justifying its refusals, Plaintiff seeks a new per se

25

rule of free license for monopolists in this Court.
28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

It

1

has tc because there was no evidence to justify its

2

refusals below.

3

Secondly, reviewing the evidence under the

4

established rule, which I will mention in a moment,

5

there clearly was sufficient evidence for the jury to

6

find, in taking all of the conduct as a whole, that this

7

conduct was exclusionary, this conduct was ,in violation

8

of Section 2 of the antitrust laws.

9
10

Now let me tell you just a little bit about
how this case was tried, because as you know --

11

QUESTION;

Could I just ask --

12

MR. TPAUTKAN;

monopolization?

16
17
18
19
20

MR. TRAUTMAN;

The theory of

monopolization -QUESTION;

Can you state what monopolization

is just briefly?
MR. TRAUTMAN;

Yes.

The theory of

21

monopolization is I think as this Court has stated it in

22

Grinnell, and that is that it condemns conduct which

23

maintains or extends a monopolist's power, but it does

24

not condemn conduct which is the result of a superior

25

product, business acumen, or historic accident.

ME. TEAUTMAN;

9

This was a colloguy in the

And in that

colloquy, counsel was responding, because some of the

evidence was, in terms of how the advertisements went,

there was cooperation in advertising.

arguing that that's not relevant to determining the

Quite clearly, the mere mention of the right

That isn't, of course, the basis on

QUESTION:

4

Well, the Court of Appeals went on

5

to say that this preserved Defendant’s opportunity to

6

challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on that

7

issue.

8

MR. TRAUTMAN;

9

QUESTION*

That’s right.

So you’re really asking, if you ask

10

us to affirm on the basis of the insufficiency of the

11

argument as part of a motion for directed verdict,

12

you're asking us to take a different view of the

13

sufficiency of that motion than the Court of Appeals

14

took .

15

MR. TRAUTMAN*

16

QUESTION;

17
18

that.

That’s correct.

May I ask one other question about

Do you contend that there’s a duty to cooperate?
MR. TRAUTMAN;

We contend that the law in

19

terms of a monopolist is that you can refuse to deal,

20

that is you can refuse to cooperate, if you have a

21

legitimate business reason.

22

QUESTION*

Because the judge instructed the

23

jury that a corporation which possesses monopoly power

24

is not under a duty to cooperate.

25

agrees with that much.

I guess everybody

And that’s all the law

8

In this particular case, the reason we think

9

the jury rejected the justifications presented and the

10

reason the court let it go to the jury is that we had

11

targeted conduct.

12

asked to buy tickets in the first year, 1977 -- our

13

first response was, sell us tickets like you do to tour

14

operators, we’ll package the ticket ourselves, we’ll

15

promote the ticket ourselves — they said no.

We had situations where, when we

There was no question of price or terms or how

we were going to do it.

That’s on page 34 of the joint appendix.
QUESTION;

19
20

They said absolutely not.

Weren't you asking to buy them at a

discount ?
MR. TRAUTMAN:

21

No.

There is no evidence.

22

There is no evidence of that.

And I agree with Mr.

23

Cooper; I think the fair inference is that the request

24

was,

25

no, and there was never any further discussion because

QUESTION.:

2

Way I ask what may be a stupid

3

question.

Can a normal fellow who wants to go skiing

4

buy tickets a week in advance, daily tickets?

5

ME. TRAUTMAN:

6

QUESTION;

7

MR. TRAUTMAN;

8

No.

It must be bought day by day?
But you see, the point, what

Highlands wanted to do was essentially to buy a
three-day ticket, which they sold in advance to tour

10

operators, a three-area three-day ticket or a three-area

11

four-day ticket, and package that with their ticket and

12

create a four-mountain ticket, which had been demanded

13

over the last 16 years.
QUESTION;

14

But an individual consumer could

15

not have gone to their wondov and said, on Monday and

16

said, I'd like tickets I can use on Thursday, Friday and

17

Saturday?
MR. TRAUTMAN;

18

Not daily tickets.

But that's

1

not the full array of tickets that were available and

20

that's not the type of tickets that were sold to tour

21

operators.

22

QUESTION;

Mr. Cooper, I understand that their

23

refusing to honor your coupons and things like that

24

wouldn't have involved price-fixing at all, but the

25

MB. TRAUTMAN:

3

QUESTION;

4

That’s correct.

And you now have an injunction

requiring this monopolist to price-fix with Highlands.
MB. TRAUTMAN;

5

We have an injunction which

6

exists now only because the Petitioner wanted it to

7

exist for another year while this case was appealed.

8

That —
QUESTION:

MB. TRAUTMAN:

Well, nevertheless —
— particular injunction is

going to run out.
QUESTION;

12

Nevertheless, you have that

injunction.

You have that injunction, and you say

everybody agrees that you don't have a duty to

16

a duty of the monopolist to price-fix with your client.

But you must apparently think that there is

17

MR. TRAUTMAN;

18

QUESTION:

No.

No, we don't think that.

Well, you say that part of your

19

claim is that the monopolist refused to sell a joint

20

ticket.

21

MR. TRAUTMAN;

As part of our claim, taken

22

with all of the other conduct.

We think that was the

precis to what occurred thereafter, and what occurred

thereafter is, when they said to us, we don't want

Your Honor, we think that the evidence shows

2

in terms of the sales of these tickets that they were

targeted, because testimony by the financial vice

essentially admitted this -- is because you' re ou r

8

operators, which the evidence showed were al so

9

competitors, because what do tour operators do?

10

They do the exact same thing that Highlands

12

13

Aspen, and that's what Highlands wanted to d o.

And they try to get people to come to

14

But Highlands was singled out over others

15

because Highlands was also a competitor in t erms of

supplying services.

17

QUESTION:

Well, didn't the Colorado Attorney

18

General think that this joint ticket was a price fix,

19

illegal price fix?

20

MR. TRAUTMAN;

The Colorado Attorney General

21

filed a lawsuit alleging that there was price-fixing.

22

The lawsuit terminated with

consent decree very specifically said the four-area

8

And again, a flat refusal.

After we couldn't tuy tickets to put together

the next thing we thought of was, well,

They were used in Aspen for 16 years, a

Sow, both of these refusals again were

9
10

targeted, because they accepted coupons from other

11

competitors and their customers.

12

type of conduct, where the consumer would show up a t the

13

window with a Highlands ticket, a Highlands coupon, and

14

say please exchange it, and they'll say, no, we won’t

15

accept your medium of exchange, that they were telling

16

the consumers the same thing that Lorain Journal was

telling consumers.

18

the refusal to do the same thing to Highlands, that's

2

important, because what that does is it disproves all of

3

their justifications.
How could they possibly have free rider

4
5

problems with Highlands, but not have them with tour

6

operators?

7

could they possibly have free rider problems with

8

coupons when they didn't have free rider problems in

9

Summit County with coupons?

Highlands wanted to do the same thing.

How

So we think that that contrary conduct in

10
11

similar situations exposes those refusals to deal as

12

ones that create no economic detriment to the incentives

13

to invest in this particular company, as hypothetically

14

surmised by Hr. Cooper.

15

reveals that it was targeted conduct, trying to prevent

16

Highlands from competing with its package.

find we think also that it

Let me just mention the competitive effect and

17
18

what the evidence was on that issue.

Highlands invested

19

in and helped develop this four-area joint venture, this

20

four-area ticket.

21

for about 16 years.

It had been in existence since 1962,

And in 1973 Highlands brought an innovation,

22
23

creating Aspen Reservations, Inc., as we discuss in our

24

brief.

25

innovation, which was the around the neck format, and

And with that innovation came another

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the around the neck format is really what made this

2

venture take off, which made this distribution system

3

superior to the daily lift tickets, because now, instead

4

of having to go back to the ticket window and stand in

5

line every day, they could go right into the lift and go

6

up the mountain.

7

They could choose any one of the four areas cn

8

any given day.

That particular distribution system, the

9

four-area ticket, became the state of the art way of

10

gaining access in multi-mountain resorts.

11

convenience with variety, two things that skiiers when

12

they came to such resorts wanted.

13

It coupled

In every other market that Ski Company

14

operated in, it participated in these arrangements.

15

Aspen, after it kicked Highlands out of the four-area

16

ticket, it didn’t return to just offering daily tickets;

17

it returned to a very similar type system which combined

18

convenience with variety.

The refusal then of Ski Company to allow us to

market our own substitute product by refusing to sell

4

tickets to us or accept coupons had two fundamental

5

adverse impacts on the competitive process.

6

short run, consumers were deprived of a product that

7

they wanted, that they clearly had demanded, that they

8

had voted on clearly and shown to be the preferred type

9

of ticket.

In the

And in the long run Highlands was slowly being

10
11

driven from the market.

The evidence showed -- and we

12

ask you to look at Exhibit 97, which shows that

13

Highlands was falling in terms of its skiier visits,

14

despite the fact that the evidence showed that it was a

15

quality mountain, a quality product, and was efficient.
In conclusion, let me just state that an

16
17

affirmance in this case will not create a duty to

18

cooperate.

19

well-established Section 2 precedent will be continued

20

which permits refusals to deal by monopolists provided

21

that they are supported by efficiencies or other

22

business justifications.

verdict, where quite clearly there was strong evidence

24

that there were no efficiency or other justifications tc

25

support these targeted refusals.

By contrast, a reversal of this case, in light

2

of the record below, will result in a freeing of a

3

monopolist to completely refuse to deal without any

4

justification, even though there’s a demonstrable

showing of damage to the competitive process, even

6

though innovation will be retarded, even though there

7

will cnly be one competitor in the market potentially,

that is Aspen Ski Company.

than just a call for trader sovereignty.
