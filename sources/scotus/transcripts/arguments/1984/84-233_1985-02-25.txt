OPAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR R. MILLER, ESQ.,
ON PEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MILLER;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court.

The two issues in this case

10

are, first, whether the state of Kansas, consistent with

11

the notions of individual liberty and interstate

12

federalism imbedded in the due process clause and the

13

full faith and credit clause may assert jurisdiction and

14

enter a binding judgment affecting thousands of

15

non-residents of Kansas who have had no contacts with

16

Kansas and whose oil and gas royalty interest claims

17

have absolutely nothing to do with Kansas and when there

18

is no legitimate public policy of Kansas implicated in

19

the action, and second, whether Kansas can

20

indiscriminately apply Kansas law to each and every one

21

of these claims.

22

The petitioner asserts that the answer tc both

23

of these questions is in the negative.

24

line of cases starting with International Fhoe and

25

moving through Hanson and Denckla, and most recently

In an unbroken

further articulated in the Woodson case, for 40 years
this Court has established a constitutional requirement
that minimum contacts must exist between a party and a
state before that state can assert jurisdiction over
that party, that there must be a relationship among the
defendant, the forum, and the litigation, to use
language from those cases.
As fully articulated in Justice White's
opinion in the Woodson case, that minimum contact
standard serves as a principal, realistic, and flexible
instrument protecting two values.

First is the liberty

interest of the individual not to be subjected to

13

ligitation in a forum with which he or she has not

14

voluntarily affiliated.

15

The second objective of the minimum contacts

16

test is to limit the authority of each state within the

17

context of the federal system.

18

citizen of Massachusetts, and Mr. Kubbich of Phillips

19

Petroleum as a citizen of Oklahoma, has an individual

That means that I as a

20

liberty interest not to be burdened, not to be affected,

21

not to have his property rights or personal rights

22

affected by a state that he has not affiliated with.

QUESTION;

So this would just -- your

submission is that that is just a limit on plaintiff
class actions?

ME. MILLER*.

Our position, Justice White, is

2

that although those cases which I have described do

3

speak in terms of the defendant, because the party tc be

4

affected in those cases were defendants, that that same

5

principle must be applied to non-resident class

6

members.

7

8

QUESTION:

And it isn't enough just to give

them an option to opt-out?

9

ME. MILLER:

Absolutely not.

This Court has

10

said several times that a cause of action is a property

11

right.

12

said it in effect in the Kullane case.

13

in Boddie.

14

It has said that in the Zimmerman case.

It has

adjudicated by the sovereignty of my

So a plaintiff class has — the

23

Constitution requires the plaintiff's class to be

24

limited to those who have some realistic connection with

MR. M ILL ER:

Hell, those members of the

plaintiff’s class who have voluntarily affiliated by
some affirmative act.
QUESTION:

Right, like the named

MR. KILLER:

plaintiffs.

Like the named plaintiffs or

anyone from any state who would wish to join the named
plaintiffs in that action.
QUESTION:

You would require an opt-in
t

procedure in effect?
MR. KILLER:

We would require, and I believe

11

the constitution requires that there be an affirmative

12

act taken by the non-resident to show a willingness to

13

subject himself to the forum.

14

QUESTION:

Even if you are right, I am

15

concerned about the standing of your client to raise

16

that question for one of the 28,000 some odd people who

17

apparently have not come forward to object.

18

MR. MILLER:

We base our standing on cases

19

going back to Hansen and Denckla in which a defendant

20

from Florida was permitted by this Court to assert on

21

behalf of an absent trustee the non-jurisdiction of the

22

state of Florida over that Delaware trustee.

23

In that situation, this Court said that those

24

Floridians had a direct, substantial personal interest'

25

in the outcome of that jurisdictional question, in part,
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

of coarse, because the Delaware trustee was declared by

2

Florid a law to be indispensable.

3
4

We believe that the non-resident,
non-vo litional plaintiff class members are also

5

indisp ensable parties to their own claims, just as that

6

Delawi re trust was indispensable in the Hansen case.

7

QUESTION^

Well, if these non-residents are

8

p r o pe r parties, you may have to pay them.

9

like a

10

That sounds

piece of standing, doesn't it?
MR. MILLFR:

Well, our standing, I believe, is

11

predic ated on cur own personal interest in this case,

12

We hav e been subjected in Kansas to a lawsuit and the

13

judgme nt now in favor of 28,100 plaintiffs.

14

only s omewhere between 500 and

15

leased plaintiffs that would satisfy any of the due

16

proces s standards.

17

QUESTION;

There are

1,000 Kansas or Kansas

Well, I suppose even now if all the

18

partie s were notified that the Phillips attorney is

19

mak ing an argument that you people shouldn't be entitled

20

to sha re, but please write us a letter now and we will

21

give y ou some money, I suppose even at this late date

22

thee c culd be some opt-ins, couldn't there?

23

MR. MILLER;

If you believe that each of the

24

non-re sident class members has a constitutional right to

25

make u p his own mind as to whether his piece of property

is to

be put on the litigation chessboard,

then it seems

to me that if, to go back to Justice O'Connor's
reference to the opt-in class, if Kansas wishes to
expand its class action power,

then its invitation to

non-residents, its invitation to those with whom it has
no constitutional affiliation, must come at a moment in
time that is meaningful.
If one looks at the class action statute of
Kansas, which is virtually but not completely identical
to Federal Rule 23, you discover that the notice
provided for and the opt-out right and the

12

representation provided for by the Kansas class action

13

statute comes after certification, which we submit is

14

not a rational time at which the non-resident class

15

member can exercise his right to participate or not

16

participate.

17

This case is a classic illustration of that,

18

because three years went by between the institution of

19

the action and the notice to the absent class members.

20

We were obliged under the normal rules of
assertion of threshold defenses to make the

this issue.

MR. MILLER:

If one views life with 20/20

hindsight, Justice Rehnquist, if you ask me or any

18

rational person, would you prefer to have a check for

19

$10 or not to have a check for $10, I assume I would

20

take the $10 every time.

21

But you cannot construct a principle about

22

state court jurisdiction and the legitimacy of Kansas

23

powers with the assumption that the class will always

win.

But even in a situation in which there were no

18

such single forum, the fact remains that at most, you

19

might have state-based class actions in a few states,

depending on what their circumference of jurisdictional

21

reach would be.

MR. KILLER:

I would hope so, Your Honor.

It

2

is quite possible that you wouldn't have precisely the

3

same efficiency of a single nationally based class.

4
5
6

You

might have to have two, three, four regionally based
classes, but certainly efficiency cannot be the be-all
and end-all of this.

7

It would be efficient, for example, if a court

8

like Kansas, which has a party rule structure just like

9

the federal rules, it would be efficient to be able to

10

assert

11

assert jurisdiction over a third party to a counterclaim

12

or a cross-claim, to assert jurisdiction ever a

13

necessary or indispensable party, a Pule 19 party.

14

jurisdiction over a third party defendant, to

I don't think anyone would ever argue that

15

there is ancillary jurisdiction over these non-parties

16

just because the party structure of the federal rules or

17

the rules of Kansas permitted a procedural device to be

18

used to expand the scope of the action.

19

So, I am mystified as to why through the

20

simple device of saying this is a class action that

21

suddenly the state of Kansas has broader geographic,

22

broader due process reach than the state of Kansas would

23

have over a necessary or indispensable party, over a

1

MR. MILLER i

No,

I would submit that if you

2

simply apply the tripa rtite standard that this Court

3

recently announce! in the Hague case, that is a

4
5

legitimate and reasona ble limitation on state court
choice of law.

6

You ne ed go no further.

With great d eference, Justice Stevens, I think

7

if we applied the test espoused in your concurring

8

opinion in that case, one would be hard pressed to see

9

what conceivable inter est the state of Kansas has in

10

applying its law to a transaction about Oklahoma gas

11

between Oklahomans and a company whose principal base is

12

in Oklahoma.

13

QUESTION;

May I ask also, because it helps me

14

focus on the issue, on what particular issues of law do

15

you think it was most outrageous for them to do what

16

the y iid ?

17

MR. MILLER:

There are several, Your Honor.

18

First,

19

it is very important to understand that Shutts II and

20

Shutts I are two entirely different cases, they are not

21

the same case in a later manifestation, you see that

22

what the state of Kansas did without citing Hague is

23

literally say, we have jurisdiction here, and absent

24

compelling reasons, we are going to apply Kansas law

25

across the board.

when you look at the structure of Shutts II, and

And then, in what might be called all fruits

2

are apples approach, the state of Kansas said all of

3

these contracts are the same.

The truth of the matter

is, all the contracts are not the same.

Some of the

5

contracts that Phillips has, particularly with producers

6

as opposed to royalty owners, are no interest contracts

7

that do not call for payment until the end of the

8

suspense royalty period, and explicitly say no interest.
We know from the Supreme Court of Texas in a

10

post-Shutts I, pre-Shutts II opinion that the state of

11

Texas would enforce that contract.

12

chose to ignore that in favor of Kansas's perception of

13

what is fair.

Second,

The state of Kansas

the official statutory interest rates

15

in the other states, particularly Texas, the most

16

dominant state, Oklahoma, Louisiana, New Mexico,

17

Wyoming, range between 6 and 7 percent.

18

Kansas chose to use what is called the FERC rate.

that the relationship between royalty owners and gas

We estimate that the application of the

no-interest contracts would reduce that $6.5 million

liability to something under $2 million, perhaps as low

MR. KLEIN;

Nell, I think the Court has

14

confused those concepts, Your Honor, but I think it is a

15

matter that is, in some cases the Court refers to the

16

right to invoke others' rights as Article III standing,

17

such as in Warth, and in other cases they refer to it as

18

prudential standing.

19

QUESTION;

Well, it would seem here within the

20

meaning of Article III standing that there is a case or

21

controversy, and you have someone who is well able to

22

litigate the issue, and that it is more a matter of

prudential standing if

there is a problem at all.

say well able to litigate the issue, mind you, they have

And the reason we have this doctrine, the

5

MR. KLEIN;

Well, that is simply the question

of the merits, whether opt-in would bind him or not.
What I am saying is, they don't have the standing to
raise the claim.

6

QUESTION;

Well,

I understand that, but if

7

they did, and if it were resolved that opt-in was

8

required, I suppose then you end up with a res judicata

9

situation.

10

ME. KLEIN;

Well, but if it is resolved as we

11

submit, now that we turn to the merits. Justice

12

O'Connor, if it is resolved that opt-out is sufficient,

13

they will be bound, and we frankly think they are

litigation with an opt-out opportunity and then comes in

10

conjecture, and that is what Phillips is asking you do

11

to, especially when you have a party who wants a

13

So let me turn to the merits, because again,

14

the rule here is to protect the absent class member, not

15

to protect Phillips, but I think you look at the rule

16

that Phillips espouses, you will see that in the name of

from litigation.

3

5

Predictably, Phillips argues that that is
enough.

It says there must also be a showing of minimum

contacts between the non-resident class member in the
forum.

6

Phillips reaches this conclusion, we submit,

7

by ignoring significant and almost obvious differences

8

between plaintiff class members and defendants,

9

differences that we believe justify a different

10

constitutional due process approach to protecting the

11

rights of both groups.

12

Now, a defendant, of course, rarely wants to

13

be in court at all, and certainly we know, we take it as

14

a given that when he is opposing jurisdiction, he

15

doesn't want to be in that court.

16

Phillips neglects this with its interstate federalism

17

argument, and it neglects the Court's holding in

18

Insurance Company versus Ireland, if the defendant wants

19

to be in a court, he is free to come in at any time

20

irrespective of the federalism arguments.

21

If he did, and

Now, starting from that premise -- you have to

22

realize every minimum contacts case so far has started

Now, let's turn to a plaintiff class member.

Thus the class action, in

Now, given that circumstance, the plaintiff's

19

circum stance, it is impossible, we submit, that a

20

minimum contacts requirement could protect him.

21

what it will do is limited the potential forums that he

22

can have his claim heard in, and he will be in a

23

different position from the other plaintiffs in cases

24

like Keeton versus Hustler who, because they have large

25

claims, can go to their forums.

I would

like to address the choice of law issue that has been

raised here.

Now, Phillips objects to the choice of law

10

by the Kansas Supreme Court on the grounds that its

11

application to the claims of the non-resident class

12

members violated the principles set forth in this

13

Court's decision in Allstate versus Hague.

14

Now,

in Allstate, the Court made clear that in

15

deciding whether a state may apply its law to a dispute,

16

it does not matter that another state might have an

17

interest or even a greater interest in that dispute.

18

the Court said, the forum court is allowed to apply its

19

law when it has a significant contact or contacts

20

creating state interests such that, and this is the

21

important part, such that the application of its law is

22

neither arbitrary nor fundamentally unfair.

23

As

Now, to clarify our position and to state it

24

briefly, Kansas's contact with Phillips is

25

constitutionally sufficient in the circumstances of this

chose to apply was by no means parochial, but rather was

borrowed directly from a federal regulatory program that

actually led to the dispute in question in this case.

Now, the plurality opinion in Allstate --

You must be arguing that it doesn't

MR. KLEIN*

For this point it doesn't make a

there is not one law that has to be chosen.

Minnesota and Wisconsin had diametrically opposed laws

on stacking.

9

The law was applied in Minnesota.

That is -I mean,

A contract was entered into in Wisconsin.
The court found

sufficient contacts, and of those contacts, a

11

significant one was the fact that the insurance company

12

was doing business in both states.

13

Now, this Court said as long ago as 1908 that

a state could prevent a corporation from practicing,

from doing business within its jurisdiction if it
