CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Perwin, I think you may proceed whenever
you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL S. PERWIN, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

8
9

MR. PERWIN:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court, the first question is

10

whether this Court's jurisdiction is conferred by direct

11

appeal under Subsection 1254.2.

12

We submit that the Circuit Court declared

13

unconstitutional as applied a provision of Florida's

14

long arm statute which confers jurisdiction over one who

15

breaches a contract in Florida by failing to perform

16

acts required by the contract to be performed in

17

Florida, in this case, by failing to make payments under

18

a franchise lease and purchase and sales agreement

19

connected with a Burger King franchise in a suburb of

20

Detroit, Michigan.

21

Under Subsection 1254.2, the answer to that

22

question depends upon the Circuit Court’s chosen

23

resolution of the issue.

24

Court's opinion states, both parties agree that by its

25

plain language the jurisdictional statute in question

In this case, as the Circuit

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

plainly reached the conduct at issue.
Rather than revisiting that assumption, the

2
3

Circuit Court proceeded to consider the constitutional

4

question, and concluded that the District Court's

5

exercise of jurisdiction was inconsistent with minimal

6

constitutional requirements.
We suggest that on that basis, given that

7

8

resolution, the prerequisites for the acceptance of a

9

direct appeal under Subsection 1254.2 were satisfied.

10

As this Court said in its 1984 Franchise Tax Board

11

decision, a necessary predicate to the Court of Appeals'

12

holding is that enforcement of the state statute would

13

be inconsistent with federal law, hence invalid under

14

the Constitution.

15

under Section 1254.2.

Accordingly, we have jurisdiction

We also argued that the parties' stipulation

16
17

in the District Court was an appropriate one in light of

18

the plain language of this statute and its

19

interpretation by a clear majority of Florida appellate

20

courts.

21

question of direct appeal, the case is one of

22

far-ranging and far-reaching importance.

23

And finally, we argued that independent of the

It implicates a way of doing business which is

24

increasingly pervasive in our society, and therefore

25

renders appropriate the acceptance of jurisdiction by

this Court
My intention would be to rest with that, to

3

submit the position of our brief on that issue, and in

4

the absence of any inquiries, to proceed to the merits.

5

The question on the merits is whether the

6

Circuit Court erred in holding that Florida's exercise

7

of jurisdiction was inconsistent with the minimal

8

requirements of due process, and that requires, of

9

course, that we aggregate the contacts between these

10

franichsees in Detroit and Burger King's headquarters in

11

Miami and determine whether or not there were sufficient

12

affiliating circumstances to put the franchisees on

13

notice that they might be called to answer in a Florida

14

court for any breach of contract or trademark

15

in f ringement.

16

The contacts in this case can be abrogated

17

under two general categories.

The first might be

18

applicable to a case in which all we had was an arm's

19

length contract for the purchase and sale of goods,

20

independent of the intimacy of the franchise

21

relationship which we have in this case.

22

In other words, even in the abstract there are

23

a category of signals in the course of this relationship

24

and in the contracts that were created between the

25

parties, which we submit were independently sufficient
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

to put the franchisees on notice of the possibility of a

2

defense.
For example, three separate contracts, the

3
4

lease agreement, the franchise agreement, and the

5

purchase and sale agreement for equipment all called for

6

the application of Florida law, creating an unmistakable

7

signal of Florida's interest in the case, and under this

8

Court's pronouncement in the International Shoe case,

9

suggesting that the franchisees avail themselves of the

10

protection and benefits of the forum.
Second, the lease agreement called for

11
12

arbitration to be held in Florida if necessary, which

13

this Court has at least acknowledged might represent a

14

forum of implicit consent to jurisdiction of the Florida

15

cour ts .

Third, the contracts are replete with

references to Miami as Burger King's headquarters and as

We have abrogated 13 intermediate appellate

court decisions representing all five of the

23

intermediate appellate districts,

dispositive ruling by the Florida Supreme Court,

25

which hold that this statute means what it says, and

13

MR. PERWIN:

Yes, Your Honor.
Do you think you can just stipulate

MR. PERWIN:

No, Your Honor, I do not think -For our purposes?
There certainly can be no

stipulation as to what Florida law is.

4

MR. PERWIN:

I would respectfully submit that

5

the decision would not be on the basis of the parties'

6

stipulation but on the basis of the Circuit Court's

7

holding that given that stipulation the statute was

8

unconstitutional as applied.
I agree that the Circuit Court had the

9
10

prerogative to revisit that assumption.

11

that because the Circuit Court did not do so, but

12

accepted the stipulation, and proceeded to find that

13

invocation of the statute was inconsistent with the

14

requirements of due process, that the Circuit Court

15

necessarily declared the statute unconstitutional as

16

applied.

17

QUESTION:

My position is

Well, the Court of Appeals I

18

thought did not hold that as a matter of state law the

19

Florida statute would allow state courts to exercise

20

jurisdiction.

21

MR. PERWIN:

That's correct.

There is no

22

formal holding to that effect.

The Circuit Court merely

23

begins its opinion by acknowledging the parties'

24

stipulation and then declines to revisit it, not

25

expressly, but by effectively proceeding to the

In addition, Your Honor, I would respectfully

submit that the case, regardless of the posture in which

it reaches this Court, has far-reaching implications for

the nature of franchise relationships.

11

the franchise relationship as it exists in the United

12

States.

14

disparate enterprises, and therefore is appropriate for

review in that context.

QUESTION:

Just to make sure I understand what

17

you and Justice O'Connor have been talking about, the

18

Court of Appeals majority opinion says that Rudzewicz

19

concedes that his activities fall within the reach of

20

the Florida long arm statute.

21

Now, there may have been a stipulation, but

22

the Court of Appeals talks about in terms of a

23

concession.

24
25

MR. PERWIN:

Yes, Your Honor, that is what I

am referring to, and what I find significant in that is
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that the Court of Appeals appeared to have accepted that

2

concession rather than undertaking any scrutiny of the

3

Florida decisions in this area, and thus far we have

4

undertaken such scrutiny in our briefs and we have

5

suggested that the clear majority of Florida decisions

6

comport with the parties' agreement below.

7

There was a second set of contacts in this

8

case independent of the disparate and abstract

9

references to Florida as the center of decisionmaking

10

for Burger King which are perhaps even more significant,

11

and that is that this was not an arm's length purchase

12

and sales agreement, which is the subject matter of the

13

many Circuit Court opinions that we have discussed in

14

this case in our briefs.

15

This was a 20-year interdependent franchise

16

agreement, a lease and sublease agreement whose purpose

17

was to create a continuing relationship between the

18

parties, not to separate them at some arm's length, but

19

a continuing relationship between the parties in which

20

the franchisees willingly subjected themselves to a

21

degree of intimate control over the quality and the very

22

finest details of the franchise operation, and received

23

substantial consideration for that agreement, the

24

consideration of minimizing the risk of failure and of

25

maximizing the chances of success by trading on a
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

national reputation, a national marketing structure, and

2

a built-in clientele.

3

That, it seems to me, is a central

4

distinguishing feature of your typical purchase and

5

sales agreement in which you have parties from two

6

jurisdictions, and which it calls for the application of

7

the law of one of them.

8
9

In this case the franchisees had the
unilateral power to reject the formation of that

10

relationship.

11

desired, to create a purely local enterprise to control

12

it 100 percent free of any or almost any connection with

13

interstate commerce and to do so free of any control by

14

anyone else.

15

They had the perfect option, had they

They made the decision to reject that option.

16

Instead they applied to Burger King Corporation for

senior partner in an accounting firm.

expertise or knowledge in the restaurant business.

20

did this because by subjecting himself to such rigid

21

standards and controls, he was able to achieve or seek

22

an investment success in an area in which he might not

23

otherwise have been able to do so.

character of this relationship.

2

into a meaningful business relationship with a

3

corporation which he knew to be centered in another

4

jurisdiction, and there are a plethora of decisions by

5

this Court on both sides of the issue which seem to make

6

that a controlling factor.

7

He purposefully entered

For example, in the McGee case, it was the

8

insurer who had solicited the business of the insured by

9

sending voluntarily and unilaterally a reinsurance

10

certificate into his state.

11

magazine who had made the purposeful decision to

12

disseminate in the jurisdiction.

13

newspaper which purposefully directed its article toward

14

the plaintiff.

15

In Keeton, it was the

In Calder , it was the

All cases in which the defendant had the

16

unilateral ability to avoid the contact which he

17

voluntarily created, and on the other side of tne

18

ledger, in, for example, the Hanson case, it was because

19

the trustee had undertaken no unilateral activity of his

20

own which might have subjected himself to jurisdiction

21

that this Court denied Florida's jurisdiction.

22

In the Kulko Case, it was because the wife had

23

moved voluntarily to California and the husband had no

24

control over that activity and had undertaken no

25

unilateral contact of his own, that this Court held that
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the exercise of jurisdiction was inappropriate.

2

In the Rush case, it was because the insured

3

had no control over the ubiquity of his insurer, State

4

Farm, and over its presence in some other jurisdiction,

5

that this Court held that the exercise of jurisdiction

6

over the insured was inappropriate.

7

And it was in the Worldwide Volkswagen case

8

that the Court held that the regionally focused retail

9

and wholesale outlet had no control over the decision of

10

a purchaser to create a contract with a jurisdiction

11

1,500 miles away.

12

In every one of those cases, the dispositive

13

observation seems to have been that the defendant

14

purposefully engaged in activity which he had the

15

unilateral control or ability to avoid, and that is

16

precisely what we have in this case.

17

In addition, the cause of action grew out of

18

that activity. There is no question that the requirement

19

of a connection for the exercise of specific

20

jurisdiction was satisfied, and finally, it seems to us

21

that there is no significant unfairness in Florida's

22

exercise of jurisdiction under those circumstances.

23

We listed five factors which we thought

24

relevant to the issue of fairness.

25

mention all five, and then come back to two, with your

is relevant for the purposes of jurisdiction is not so

much the question of what substantive law might apply as

a product of that process, but rather that the parties

put in their contract that they agree to comply with the

law of the state of Florida, and therefore had reason to

know that they were both invoking the benefits of

Florida law and might be called to answer for breach of

that everything can be done on a nationwide basis on

this theory?

13

MR. PERWIN:

No, of course, it is not

conceivable, but that does not undermine the objective

of trying to create some centrality of decisions on the

contract issues that exist between the parties, on the

expectations of the parties in a contractual

said in a variety of contexts that that is best served

That was first said in 1816 in Martin versus

right of review over state decisions of constitutional

dimension, and the central thesis of that opinion is

10

that uniformity of decisionmaking in a judicial context

is essential, and as recently as the M.S. Bremen case

said the same thing about consistency of result.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

20

MR. OEHMKE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

21

the Court, an interesting aspect of this case, of

22

course, is that the question of whether this is a direct

23

appeal or not was suggested when the Court noted its

24

probable jurisdiction.

Isn't that the basis for an

MR. OEHMKE:

11

I think not.

When we look at the

12

word "as applied," we see some mention of it certainly

13

in previous cases, but as applied to a particular

14

defendant rather than as applied to everyone in a

15

particular state.
QUESTION:

16

Can you point to a single case that

suggests that a holding that a statute is

unconstitutional as applied is not a basis for an

appeal?

20

MR. OEHMKE:

No, I can't, because we had some

QUESTION:

1

What if we disagree with you on

2

that, and that there is a clause for the application of

3

Florida law which is perfectly valid.

4

your case just because of that, have you?
MR. OEHMKE:

5

You haven't lost

I don't think we have.

In this

6

particular case here, even if we are going to choose to

7

apply Florida law, there still has to be minimum

8

contacts on the part of the defendant, who had

9

absolutely no contacts with the State of Florida

10

whatsoever.
Interestingly, the choice of forum provision

11
12

in the contract only applied to arbitration, not to

13

litigation, so we think that the choice of law forum

14

here not only should not be applied, because we have a

15

Michigan comprehensive statute that regulates franchises

16

that Florida doesn't have, but we also think that Burger

17

King has abandoned that argument.

As we take a look at the issue of whether or

19

not Mr. Rudzewicz did have minimum contacts, we find a

whole host of things that he never did in Florida.

QUESTION:

9

MR. OEHMKE:

10

Except to sign the contract.
Except to sign the contract,

11

Justice Marshall, the contract which did say that it was

12

entered into and made in Florida, when the reality of

13

the situation was, physically it was signed in Michigan,

14

and Burger King then mailed it down to its headquarters

15

people for signing.

16

That was the only thing that he did, was to

17

sign a contract with a Florida-based corporation, and

18

perhaps secondly, as Burger King has argued, he failed

19

to mail a check to the State of Florida, or failed to

20

mail his checks for royalty and for advertising

21

payments.
So, Burger King suggests that a non-act, a

22
23

failure to do an act, a failure to mail a check in and

24

of itself is a contact if the state law requires you to

25

do that.

We think the Florida law can be construed

We have to believe that this --

8

Justice Rehnquist, that this is not a substantial enough

9

contact to elevate itself to the level of a

10

constitutionally imagined minimum contact.
Failure to mail a check standing by itself

11
12

flies in the face of the history of decisions that have

13

said you ought to have a purposeful, an affirmative act,

14

where you deliberately intend to invoke the benefits and

15

protections of the laws, and that should probably lead

16

one to conclude that you have a continuous and

systematic doing of business in a state.

isn't it relevant in that

regard that the contract envisioned a 20-year

When it came time to sign the contract, they

that the mere fact that one contracts with a corporation

from the record that -QUESTION:

20

was the document that they used to encourage people to

21

take the franchise up.

22

In

At Pages 17 through 21 in the prospectus,

23

Burger King is required by Michigan law to list all of

MR. OEHMKE:

QUESTION:

I agree.
But that doesn't mean that only

Michigan could take jurisdiction.
MR. OEHMKE:

You are right in your analysis

7

that we could have sued in Michigan had we been quicker

8

to the draw, but we don't think that Florida should take

9

jurisdiction here because there is no continuous and

10

systematic doing of business in the State of Florida.

11

He didn't go there and didn't do anything

12

there, and I don't think that as a CPA he is put on

13

notice by the mere fact that he is dealing with a

14

Florida headquarters corporation, that he can be

15

expected to be sued there.

16

Other cases that we have heard, cases where

17

corporations are incorporated in Delaware, just the mere

18

fact that that is where they are incorporated doesn't

19

necessarily mean that one can be expected to be sued

20

where it is incorporated or where its headquarters.

21

You know,

if that is true, just because one

22

does business with a corporation that is headquartered

23

or located in another state, you can be expected to sue

24

there, be sued there,

25

everyone who does business with anpther corporation

if that alone is enough, then

ought to find out where they are incorporated, and where

2

they are located, and they ought to build into the cost

3

of the operation of their business enough money to go to

4

that state and

5

defend.

One of the themes that has come through some

6

of these cases is that Burger King is in a better

7

position economically to build into the cost of their

8

doing business enough money to finance litigation for

9

them to go where they are doing business.

10

QUESTION:

Does that theme come through from

any of the cases of this Court?

MR. OEHMKE:

14
15
16

No, they haven't.

They have come

through from some of the Court of Appeals cases.
QUESTION:

If they had gone to arbitration,

where would the arbitration have been conducted?
MR. OEHMKE:

In Florida, as far as we can

17

tell, Mr. Chief Justice, because of the choice of forum

13

provision, because parties can contract, of course, to

19

go to a different state.

20

They could contract to go to Germany or Guam,

21

we suppose, to arbitrate, but we don't think the parties

22

can contract and confer jurisdiction on a state by the

23

mere pledge that that is where they are going to go.

24

think the choice of law provision is different than a

25

choice of forum provision, and we don't think that you

1

First of all, we have argued that

we think it is unlawful to force the parties to go to

3

Florida just because -- because Michigan law -- because

4

there are no contacts there, but to the extent you wish

5

to give some weight to the fact that the parties openly

was any -- there was no bargaining, and so I think you

can ignore giving any weight to that aspect of the

That would be manifestly unfair, to make a new

rule in minimum contacts that says, just because you are

spot, you should go to them because you are put on

notice they might sue you there, even if there are no

We think it is manifestly unfair that he

should have to travel the 1,200 miles to Miami to fight

15

this lawsuit when he never set foot in Miami about this

18

deal, and has no contact with that state.

17

King's new approach that they are suggesting here is

wholly different from what it used to be, and from what

is, from what is the state of law at this present time.

And Burger

The Court of Appeals noted that all of the

contacts were in Michigan.

They reviewed the record,

22

and they noted the fact that Rudzewicz was interviewed

there, and that the Michigan office discussed price

24

terms, and that the Michigan office attended the final

closing ceremony, and that there was no evidence that

that Michigan has passed comprehensive legislation

regulating the behavior of franchisors and franchisees,

MR. OEHMKE:

QUESTION:

6

We feel --

Yes, he was.
And the payments were to be made in

MR. OEHMKE:

7

Yes, he was. Justice O'Connor,

8

and he was brought into Florida on the sole basis that

9

he had failed to send his check.

10
11

And that was all that

was done.
So we feel that that three-pronged test, were

12

it adopted by this Court, reiterated by this Court,

13

would certainly summarize a fair test that would show

14

franchisees that you are not different from Sears

15

Catalogue or from Volkswagen or from any other person

16

who does business in this country, as this Court has

17

passed for years and years on the issue.

18

You have to go find the franchise -- the

19

defendant, where the defendant was found, where there

20

was some minimum contact, assuming, of course, we are

21

not talking about a tort, but in a contract case, you

22

have got to go where there is some minimum contact.

QUESTION:

But they had a contract to be able

to use the name, whatever, some franchise product, as a
lot of them do, saying, and any dispute of it will be
governed by Florida law, and we will arbitrate in
Florida if we have to, and wouldn't it be the same

MR. PERWIN:

Yes,

had the same measure of control over the activities of
the enterprise.
