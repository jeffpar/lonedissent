MR. HIRSCH;

Mr.

12

in a manner which would he favorable tc the petitioners,

13

the question itself, we believe, is rather simply put;

expressed policy tc displace competition with a

net only tc examine the state action dcctrine as it

commenced with Parker v. Brown and as it has been

discussed by this Ccurt in subsequent opinions, but to

25

look closely at the underlying concept of federalism

upon which Parker v. Brown was based.
Tc begin this examination, we should look

2
3

briefly at the state regulatory systems as well

4

pertinent federal statutes in this area.

5

this case has legislatively mandated regulation of motor

6

carriers with pervasive regulatory schemes setting forth

Each state has established a public service

11

commission to administer that regulation in order tc

12

achieve these legislatively articulated purposes and

13

goals for the benefit of the public and the citizens of

14

these states.
On the federal level, at the same time, the

15
16

Congress of the United States first in 1935 specifically

17

reserved tc the states the

18

carriers within their state boundaries, and subsequently

19

in

20

exempted activity which if net identical is very,

the federal scheme, in order tc avail oneself cf the

exemption from the federal antitrust laws, carriers had

2

to petition the Interstate Commerce Commission for a

3

collective agreement, and in order to receive the

4

exemption by use of this agreement, they had to reserve

5

the right to independent action by each of the carriers

6

who were parties tc the agreement.

7

Shat the government proposes in this situation

8

is that contrary tc the federal scheme which required

9

the reservation of the right to independent action in

10

order to obtain relief from the antitrust laws, that the

11

states, because they dc not remove that right, because

12

they dc not compel collective activity, but only allcw

13

and authorize collective activity while still allowing

14

this independent action, have lost the right to

15

exemption from the antitrust laws.
We submit that in the context of this case,

16
17

pervasive regulatory schemes ccupled with this federal

18

background of an explicit reservation to the states of

19

the right tc regulate in this area, and Congressional

No,

16

the five states appeared in the District Court at the

his own proposal fcr whatever specific reasons he nay

3

have and underlying these reasons are certainly these

4

areas of anticompetitive conduct that the states don’t

5

intend to authorize cr approve, such as coersicn,

refusal to interline.

7

These dangers which do net enhance the pullic

8

policy

of the state to have uniform rates and to have

9

competition fcr service as opposed to

a cost plus

10

competition, the state wants to engage these individuals

11

who are dissident into the process, much as the Congress

12

of the

United States said in

19*18.

The only way you can obtain the exemption is

13
14

to allow the individual carriers to come forward and

15

speak when they disagree with the collective proposal.
QUESTION:

16

Under the state schemes, is the

17

right of independent action of the independent carrier

18

different from what it is under the federal scheme, in

19

your view?

1

that Congress does net intend to displace the right of

2

the state as sovereign to enact laws within its bounds,

3

then surely when Congress later speaks in the same area

4

and does that which the states do, it is absurd to argue

5

that under a federalism doctrine they can prohibit the

6

states from doing just what they are doing, that coupled

7

with the fact that they have already said, we are going

8

to leave you alone.

9

Now, the government points at this and says,

10

it was Congressional intent to allow the antitrust laws

11

to continue to apply to states, and that could be

12

inferred from the fact that they did not give the

13

exemption stated in the Seed Pullwinkle bill to the

14

states.

15

And I again say, much as the silence with

16

respect to the Sherman Act is net to be inferred to

17

apply to the states as sovereign, neither is the silence

18

in Congress in giving the exemption only on the federal

19

level to be implied that that exemption is unavailable.

ME. HIESCH*

What was

occurring in that case, the reason that case came before

this Court was that by reason of coercion and reasons of

12

refusing to interline or exchange cargoes with railroads

As a matter cf fact,

MR. WALLACE;

Our view, our understanding cf

It isn't up tc the states to decide that

Congress has already made that decision in the

Now,

9

there has been accommodation in the

not only in Parker did the initiation of the regulatory

to expand upon Justice C 'Connor 's questioning,

10

begin at the choice of the private party, but once the

growers petitioned the board for a pro-raisin program,

it then had to be submitted, once adopted, back
