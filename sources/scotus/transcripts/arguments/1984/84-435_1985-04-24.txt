ORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIUS LUCIUS ECHELES, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. ECHELES;

6

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
The issue in this case is a simple issue,

8
9

Echeles, I think

ycu nay proceed whenever you are ready.

7

Mr.

the resolution is a little more complex.

hut

The issue is

10

whether or not under Section 844, Subparagraph (i) of

11

Title 18, United States Code, a building which was a

12

two-flat residential building which

13

Petitioner here, attempted to commit arson, is covered

14

by the language of the statute that states that anyone

15

who attempts to destroy a building -- I’m sorry, anybody

16

who attempts tc destroy any tuilding used in interstate

17

or foreign commerce or in an activity affecting

18

interstate or foreign commerce commits the crime.

the defendant,

19

Tc determine legislative intent, this Court

20

frequently does look at the congressional hearings to

21

determine what the proponents cf the bill or the law

22

stated .

23

Briefly, the acts are that in February of

24

1983, the petitioner here owned a two-flat residential

25

building, one of which was occupied.

The flat was

3

1

rented by a family paying $235 a month.

It was a

2

two-flat building not used for any commercial activity

3

or business enterprise.

4

Representatives in passing the legislation stated that

5

they are passing this legislation to prevent generally

6

organized crime because it was legislation during the

7

organized crime legislation of a general nature, and

8

they prohibited the destruction of any property used

9

business purposes.

The language of the

for

That is not in the statute, but that

10

is in the congressional discussion by the

11

Representatives.
And so the question here is whether this

12

13

two-flat building,

14

purpose,

which is not used for a business

was covered under the statute.
The government has pointed out in its brief

15
16

that there were further hearings in which the language

17

was deleted when they said only business purposes, and

18

then they said only any building because they wanted

to

19

include churches, schools and police stations within

the

20

protection from being bombed or -- from being bombed.
Well,

21

when the Congress, then, when the

22

legislators stated that we will just say any building

23

and

24

stations, it did not cover, it did not state, they did

25

net state that it also covers residential buildings.

that should cover churches, schools and police

Is it a fact that business insurance was

The petitioner had insurance

the act was amended to include the wcrd

"fire."

3

precluded a building from being destroyed by means of

explosive.

they had further hearings to get around or to overrule

13

So they wanted to make more

So in 1982, they held hearings, and as the

14

Solicitor General so helpfully — helpful to the

15

petitioner, sets out in his brief on page 18, Footnote

16

20, it calls to the attention of this Court that the

17

Congress included the only -- the only amendment to the

18

Section 844 subparagraph (i) is the inclusion of the

19

word "fire,"

20

they held hearings about the inclusion, and its purpose,

21

as the government points out to Your Honors, is to

22

overcome the three Circuit Court holdings that fire was

23

not an explosive.

24

there is no questin that fire is included in the concept

25

of the criminal statutes.

MR. ECHELES;

Well, Mr. -- Judge Friendly

stated that the fact that the government intended to use

as a nexus fox federal jurisdiction the fact that the

building in Mennuti used electricity or gas was an

insufficient, improper and impermissible nexus upon

would assume that the researchers advising the

legislators with respect to the three circuits about

fire, fire not being included in explosive, would have

advised the Congress about the Hennuti decision.

14

they had that knowledge, and, says the government in

its

15

helpful Footnote 20, the House report provided that,

quote,

section, 844 (i), "shall otherwise remain unchanged."

18

That is, it is my respectful presentation to Your Honors

the Hennuti decision -- they didn't change any

In any event, every circuit that

13

has had this Question, that is, the question whether cr

14

not the use of gas or the use of electricity takes it

15

into the federal jurisdiction, has ruled against it.

16

the very recent case decided just two months ago, United

17

States v. Hansen and Terlecky, two separate defendants,

for interstate purposes.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

They were

1

using the concept that the 14-apartment building had

2

electricity that was generated from out of North Dakota

3

as a basis for federal jurisdiction.

4

specifically, we will not go as far as Bussell.

5

They said

Bussell by that time had been decided.

6

Russell was decided last July, 1984.

Hansen and

7

Terlecky was decided last -- decided in February, about

8

ten days or two weeks before I submitted the brief to

9

this Court.

They said we are not going to buy that

10

concept that the use of electricity takes it into the

11

federal concept, and other cases have similarly held.

12

The Mennuti case held in the face of the government

13

argument that even though it is a residential property,

14

and even though there is income derived from it, a

15

benefit derived from this, it is not business property.

16

And we won't permit, said Mennuti, that the use of

17

electricity to that building -- it had to get

18

electricity,

19

coming in from out of state as, in this case, they

20

proved that the gas used on the second floor started jn

21

Oklahoma or Texas, met its terminus in Joliet, Illinois,

22

mixed with other gas, and finally got into the building

23

through the pipeline.

That is not a proper federal nexus.

genesis an cut of Sew York beginning, sc that the courts

13

have rejected it.

14

There is another interesting case, interesting

15

to judges, of course, because there, in United States v.

16

Nonholland, Eighth Circuit, a truck being driven by a

17

sitting circuit judge, a state judge, was being driver,

18

and there was an attempt to bomb the truck.

19

was convicted because the 844(i) statute has within it

20

not only the protection of buildings, but also

21

vehicles.

22

Well,

Eighth Circuit, said no, no, we are net going to permit

2

you to expand federal jurisdiction here even though they

3

acknowledge that the gas used in the truck had as its

4

origin an out-of-state place.
So Eonholland, Barton, Wennuti, and the latest

5

6

of the cases, Hansen and Terlecky from the Eiahth

7

Circuit, decided twe months age, in Fetruary, rejected

8

the concept that the use of electricity or gas in a

9

building is sufficient for the federal nexus.

10

Well, what else do I have?

11

In the two cases that I cite, the Lewis Casek

12

and the Eass case where we state that where a statute is

13

confusing, and it is certainly not clear if Konholland

14

rejected the government's concept that the statute

15

covers the acts in Konholland, if Kennuti rejected the

16

concept of the government that the use of interstate —

17

that the use cf gas coming from interstate brings it

18

into the federal concept, and if Hansen and Terlecky by,

19

I suppose, obiter dicta because it wasn't an issue then,

20

but it simply stated it wouldn't go so far as the

21

Seventh Circuit in Pussell in holding an interstate

22

nexus,

23

certainly an ambiguity in the statute, and two cases

24

from this Court, Rewis and Bass, suggest that under

25

those circumstances, the concept of validity should he

if those courts said that, then there is

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

applicable, and Your Honors should hold that because the

2

statute isn't clear with respect to applying to the

3

facts in this case, there should then be a reversal in

4

this case.

5

Another factor.

In its reply brief, in its

6

excellent reply brief -- I say excellent because I

7

respectfully submit that it is helpful to the petitioner

8

in this case — the government points cut that in the

9

second set of hearings, in the 1982 hearings where the

10

Congress was putting in the word "fire" where it was ret

MR. WRIGHT* Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10
11

please the Ccirts
The essential difference between the

12
13

government and petitioner concerns Congress’s intent.

14

Petitioner contends that Congress, in adopting Section

15

844(i), intended to prohibit the destruction of business

16

property only.

17

property narrowly.

Further, petitioner defines business

18

The government, in contrast, contends that

19

Congress intended to prohibit the destruction of any

20

building, including business property, as long as a

21

minimal connection is established between the use of the

22

building and commerce.

MR. WRIGHT;

Yes.

We rely on the affecting

commerce phrase -QUESTION:

Yes, and what does the government

21

say is the activity that this building was used in which

22

affected commerce?

23

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, we suggest three activities

24

that the building was used in that affect commerce:

the

25

gas that was used to heat the building, the building

was

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

used, for rental

purposes, and it was insured.

QUESTION;

Kell what -- would you say that --

2

what activity does the building become used in by reason
3

of the fact that it heats with gas that comes from out
4

of state?

Does that put it in a separate activity?

5

HE. WEIGHT;

The activity is simply the use of

6

heat, and it affects commerce in that if the building is
7

destroyed, the shipment of gas interstate would be
8

reduced.

That, of course, is our broadest argument,

and

9

it is clear that in this case, had the one two-unit
10

apartment been destroyed, the effect on commerce would
11

have been slight in this case.
12

Eut arson is not uncommon , as the evidence
13

before Congress in 1982 clearly shows, so that the
14

effect on commerce would be substantial in the aggregate
15

over t * class of cases of arsons.
16

QUESTION;

There's certainly a lot of

17

traditional law that says a piece of real property that
18

is simply sitting in Chicago or somewhere else is net in
19

interstate commerce.

20

HE. WEIGHT;

The building is not in commereo,

21

and that is why we are under the second phrase, as you
22

noted,

We believe it was

Yes,

Why isn't that the activity, and

MR. WRIGHT:

11

You do not need to go to our gas

ground.

You could simply decide this case on the fact

13

that the building was rented and hold that that is

14

enough to bring the building into an activity affecting

commerce, and if that is encugh, you do not need to gc

the interstate nexus more clear.

Let me suggest that that fits Congress’

intent.

When Congress deleted the business purposes

20

testimony from a number of Congressmen that churches,

21

schools and private dwellings, I might add, as we note

22

in our brief — Congressman Wiley and I believe

23

Congressman Gcldwater, as well, mentioned private

dwellings -- would not necessarily be considered

business property, and Congress wanted to cover those.

Well, that may be an argument,

that even that the Internal Revenue involvement is even

a thin argument in support of the case.
MR. WRIGHT;

12

We -- adopting petitioner's view

13

that this statute is limited to business purposes, we

14

think that renting property is a business purpose, and

15

we believe that it is an activity affecting commerce.
We certainly don’t think that by deleting

business purposes from the statute and broadening its

coverage, Congress would have meant to decrease its

coverage.

It is clear that the rule must be that

was the motivation for deciding -- for adding "fire or"
