have to persuade us, first of all, that the Court of

No,

I don't believe that we do

have to reach that issue, because I think in

retirement cases, the disability retirement cases, the

20

jurisdiction exists under 8347(c), and

what if Section 7703 deals

MR. MUPCKO;

21

mean

that an individual cculd never apply for retirement if

he's termina ted from his job.

3

4

that would mean a person, once he is no longer working,

5

can no longer apply for retirement.

And second, it would mean that any person who

And it means that any person who -- any

I'm sorry, yes.

Okay.

13

employee who is terminated can never gc to the Federal

14

Circuit, because he's no longer an employee.

15

We think, returning tc the interpretation of

16

8341(c), we think that the plain language itself

17

indicates that there is a bar of review of only the

18

facts and not of legal, procedural, cr constitutional

19

questions.

20

shall determine questions cf disability and that these

21

determinations are final.

22

state that it should be a final determination of

23

questions cf procedure and law and constitutional

24

rights .

25

The wording there provides that the 0PM

The language there does net

In addition, we think that the second sertence
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

of that statute specifically states that the CFN can

2

hold hearings to determine the facts of medical

3

disability, and we think that’s further language

4

supporting cur position that it's limited only to reviev

5

of fac ts.

6

In addition,

the pre-codificaticn of 1948, the

7

first finality provision, also states that decisions

8

with respect to questions of disability, and we think

9

that that language is even

10

clearer that on its face

it

only limits factual determinations.

11

But further,

we believe that Congress knows

12

how to preclude the courts from reviewing statutes,

13

when it passed 211 of the Veterans Act and also 8128 of

14

the Federal Employees Compensation Act, it said that no

15

courts of the U.S. shall have power to review such

16

action.

17

it could definitely have put that language in there.

18

and

Now, if Congress meant to eliminate all review

But we think that, even more important, if we

19

go behind the legislative words here of 8347 and look at

20

the legislative history, we think that it’s even

21

clearer.

22

review under U.S. versus Erika teaches us that we should

23

look behind a statute tc determine what the

24

Congressional intent was, and we think that at a minimum

25

it can be argued there is ambiguity here because there

First, we feel that the basis for historical

2

In fact,

the anomaly here is that the Office

of Personnel Management Director,

4

assistant testified or sent letters to the heads of

5

these departments saying that, we want to expand review

6

for involuntary mental terminations and we want to keep

7

the review the same.

12
13

QUESTION:

We

Well, Congress did at least change

the language.

14

MR. MURCKO:

Congress did make an amendment

15

adding

16

that section saying that now for involuntary mental

17

terminations there is full review under 7703, which

18

includes review not only of legal, procedural and

19

constitutional errors, tut there's now going to be

20

review for factual errors, too.

21

much abuse in terminating politically active employees,

22

and there was a large history of that action by agencies

23

in terminating people.

24
25

that section to it, that is correct.

It did add

Eecause there was sc

In addition, in the committee reports or
discussions there is no evidence that the Scroggins test

1

2

nc actual substantive change in the language of the

3

finality clause itself.

4

here of Congress was to expand the limited review and

5

give the full scope cf review tc involuntary mental

6

disability determinations and to maintain it in the

7

ether area, and we think that there is no clear and

8

convincing evidence to allow the conclusion that there

9

should

There

So we think that the intert

be no review for the federal employees' rights.

10

In addition,

we think that the second errer

11

that the court committed below was that it failed tc

12

give deference to the administrative construction cf

13

8347.

14

these cases on an administrative level, has taken the

15

position in its rulings that judicial review is

16

available by the Federal Circuit.

17

that position in the Federal Circuit below as an amicus;

18

and it notifies employees who are adversely -- who get

19

adverse decisions that they have a right tc appeal tc

20

the Federal Circuit.

The Merit System Protection Board,

In addition,

which decides

the 0PM has consistently taken

22

that position, as I mentioned hefore, in decisions

23

before

the Congress at the time this legislation was

24

passed

in

25

to give deference tc that administrative rulings,

1980.

Sc we think that the court below failed

(202) 628-9300

1

administrative det e r mi r atic r., when it ruled that it has

2

no jurisdiction.

3

In addition, we think that the Federal Circuit

4

below committed a third error when it stated that -- in

5

its construction of 8347, it raised substantial

6

constitutional questions.

7

of construction here is that if there is an

8

interpretation of a statute which will avoid the

9

constitutional issue,

then

And we think that the canon

the Court should adept that

10

construction.

11

construction that we say 8347 -- the construction that

12

was given by the court in Parodi versus 0PM by the Ninth

Circuit, that essentially is an expansion of judicial

QUESTION;

Mr. Murckc, it's Section 8347(c)

18

that the Government relies on to say that the decision

19

in your client's case case wasn’t reviewable by the

20

Federal Circuit?

21

MR. MURCKC;

22

QUESTION;

Yes,

that’s correct, Your Honor.

Now, was the language in 8347(c),

23

was that existent, did that exist verbatim before the

MR. MURCKC;

Yes, it existed verbatim except

would have treated

10

What has to be remembered there is that the application

2

it intc the adverse action procedures by providing a

special 7301 statutory right tc a hearing and the right

It seems tc us that the obvious inference from

enacting new procedures.

14

So given all of that, it seems to us the

conclusion

18

that Congress did net bring retirement

If the Court should disagree with cur
