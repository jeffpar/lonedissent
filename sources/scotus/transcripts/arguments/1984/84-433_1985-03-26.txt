ORAL ARGUMENT OE DAVID BERMAN,

ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONEES
MR. BERMAN:

Mr.

Chief Justice,

and may it

11

please the Court, on June 4th,

12

officials of the town of Burlington conducted a core

13

evaluation to determine the appropriate future placement

14

for Michael Panico, a learning disabled child who is

15

handicapped within the meanina of the Education of the

16

Handicapped Act.

1979, the school

17

As a result of that evaluation, they

18

determined that the appropriate placement for this child

19

was a classroom in the Pine Glen School, which is a

20

public school of the town of Burlington.

21

This was a classroom for children with

22

needs, and it was taught by a teacher named John

23

McAleer, who had had considerable success in dealing

24

with children of special needs, especially children with

25

learning disabilities and reading disabilities such as

Counsel, all this is five or six

Where is the youngster now?
ME. BERMAN;

T am informed now,

Your Honor,

6

that the youngster is in a private school in Beverly,

7

Massachusetts, called the Landmark School.

8

that is where he was when I was last informed of his

9

whereabouts.

10

Now,

At least

the hearing officer conducting

11

proceedings in the months of September, October,

12

November of

13

rendered a decision, and in her decision,

14

certain findings and rulings which are not necessarily

15

consistent with each other.

16

But first of all,

1979, and on January 31st,

and

1980, she
she made

she said, yes, this IEP,

17

this individual educational plan — I will call it an

18

IEF henceforth -- was appropriate.

19

McAleer was indeed an excellent teacher.

20

She said that Mr.

She noted the Carroll School was a private

21

school exclusively for children with learning

22

disabilities, and she noted that the Pine Glen School

23

was a public school with opportunities for mainstreaming

24

a child, which is the word that is used to describe

25

taking a handicapped child, as federal law requires, and

1

putting him into the mainstream of activity with

2

non-handicapped children.

3

Nevertheless, she did not uphold the IEP that

4

was written earlier.

5

Michael needed a form of teaching reading known as

6

Orton-Gillingham, that he needed small classes,

7

needed a supporting peer group, meaning other children

8

who have learning disatilities, and he needed freedom

9

from distraction.

10

She said, first of all, that

that he

Now, except with respect to the supporting

11

peer group, petitioners have never doubted that Michael

12

needed all these things, but they never could understand

13

why that would be a basis for rejecting their plan,

14

since he would have received all of them at the Pine

15

Glen School from Mr. McAleer.

16

Finally, she said over a long period of time

17

these school authorities have violated any nunber of

18

procedural rights that belong to this child, and

19

therefore T doubt whether they have the capacity to

20

implement this plan in the future.

21

Now, again, it is very unclear just what she

22

meant by that.

23

were going to yank this child out of the class in the

24

middle of the year or do something like that?

25

can really answer that question, I think,

Did she mean that the school authorities

(202) 628-9300

If

1

that is what she meant, she certainly had no basis

2

whatsoever for making that, kind of judgment.

3

On February 26,

1980, less than a month after

4

that opinion was rendered,

5

School Committee of the Town of Burlington and the town

6

itself, brought an action in the United States District

7

Court for the District of Massachusetts under Title 20

of the United States Code, Section

the petitioners, who are the

does it strike you as

10

at all odd that Congress should have given

11

authorities the right to appeal from the superintendent

12

of education's decision to the federal court?

13

MR. BERMAN;

the school

Well, no, it doesn't, Your Honor,

14

really strike me as odd, although I am constrained to

15

admit that it did strike me odd when I first thought

about the statute,

18

to seek review?

I thought, why would Congress

mind.

22

educational authorities, Your Honor, have an interest in

2

seeing that the programs that they spend vast amounts of

3

money to set up are vindicated in the courts if need he,

4

and that it is made clear through the courts that they

5

are capable of educating handicapped children, because

6

that is what they are supposed to do.

7

They are not supposed to dump handicapped

8

children on the private schools.

9

integrate them into the public schools.

They are supposed to
So that is why

10

I think Congress gave the local educational

that right to seek review.

12

Now, in July of

1980

authority

— this is about five

13

months after the action was brought -- the school

14

authorities asked Mr. Panico if he would make his son

15

available for a new evaluation that would have led

16

perhaps to a new or amended

17

no,

18

IEP.

Mr.

Panico flatly said

I will not do it.
A few months later, Mr. Panico said, well,

19

maybe I will do it, but you have to hire all new people,

20

who have no connection with your school, if you want me

21

to cooperate, and that is something that of course the

22

school authorities refused to do.

23

In February of 1981,

the Department of

24

Education threatened to cut off all of the federal funds

25

to the petitioners unless they started fundina Michael's

education, which was way past the IEP,

2

out, way past the year for which the IEP was drawn at

3

the Carroll School.

4

I should point

Faced with that ultimatum, the School

5

Committee did start in February of 1981 to pay for the

6

tuition of Michael at the Carroll School, and pay for

7

his transportation, with the strict understanding,

8

however, that if the petitioners prevailed after a

9

trial, the petitioners would have that money reimbursed

10

to them, and indeed, that understanding is enshrined in

11

the first opinion that was to be rendered by the United

12

States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in this

13

case, and that was rendered in June of

14

1981.

In Pay of 1982, there was a trial.

The judge

15

took the hearing officer’s decision as prima facie

16

evidence on all facts therein stated.

17

burden of proof was on the school department,

18

petitioners here, for the year 1979-1980, and for

19

subsequent years the burden of proof was on the

20

parents.

She said the

The trial produced on both sides unusually

22

competent expert testimony, and -- I say both sides.

2

terrihly important.

3

Levine, never stated an opinion as to what was an

4

appropriate placement.

The respondent's expert. Dr.

He wouldn't touch that subject.

The petitioner's expert, Dr.

Kinsmore, was

6

very forthright on it.

7

find the Pine Glen School to be the egual of the Carroll

8

School, he thought it was superior to the Carroll

9

School.

10

He said that not only did he

He pointed out that the progress that the

11

child had made in three years at the Carroll School had

12

been no better than the child's progress during his

13

first three years when he wasn't in any special school

14

at all, but was merely getting one hour of tutorial at

15

the Memorial School.

16

And both doctors agreed -- a very important

17

point, I dare say -- that the type of remediation that

18

would have been offered at the Pine Glen School was a

19

good remediation for this child.

Mr. Berman.
Yes, Your Honor.
Do you plan to argue the legal

issue that we have to resolve in this case?

24

MR. BERMAN;

QUESTION*.

Yes, Your Honor.

I shall --

Because I didn’t think that we were

going to review the propriety of the IEP here.

2

thought we had granted cert to decide the legal issue,

3

whether tuition was reimbursible under 1415's

4

provisions, assuming it is decided at the trial court

5

level on remand that an adequate IEP was not offered.

6

ME. BERMANj

I

Your Honor, there are actually

7

two issues as to which this Court has granted

8

certiorari.

9

second one, which is highly related to it, is whether

One is the effect of 1415(e)(3), and

the

10

damages, or tuition reimbursement, whatever one wishes

11

to call it, can be awarded under 1415(e)(2).

12

I would

like to address 1415(e)(3) first.

And

13

this is a statute which says, "During the

14

any proceedings conducted pursuant to this section,

15

unless the state or local educational agency and

16

parents or guardian otherwise agree, the child shall

17

remain in the then current educational placement of such

18

child, or if applying for initial admission to a

19

school, shall with the consent of the parent or guardian

20

be placed in the public school program until all such

21

proceedings have been complete."

22

Now,

the

public

I deliberately read both clauses of that

23

statute, not just the first clause, because one of the

24

arguments that respondents make in their briefs,

25

especially the respondent Panico,

is that this statute

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

only tars the local educational agency or the state

2

aducational agency from changing the placement of a

3

child while proceedings are pending.

4

It has no bar whatsoever against the parents,

5

and

6

very same sentence of this statute, when Congress

7

intended to say that only the consent of the parents is

8

needed,

9

"with the consent of the parent or guardian."

that can *t be, because in the second clause, the

it said so in very clear language.

MR. BERMAN;

There is no effective placement

2

in the sense that the parents have rejected the IEP, but

3

there is certainly a placement, Your Honor, in the

4

practical sense that there is a classroom

6

to which this

That is a placement in the sense that the

7

school authorities have made a place for this child in

have a situation where the parents wanted

In

1

your view, the words "the then current educational

placement of the child" refer to the school he was

scheduled to attend in the fall rather than the one he

Your Honor.

Even though he hadn't yet enrolled

and the parents hadn *t consented?

8
9

That's correct,

MR. BERDAN;
yes.

That is correct, Your Honor,

I think that I would really suggest that the way

10

Congress has written 1415(e)(3), placement of a

11

handicapped child is a little like domicile.

12

13

MR. BERMAN;

tha t.

You are asking that
"Shall remain

Well, I would have to agree with

Your Honor that the word "remain" is a troublesome word,
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

but I think Congrass in most instances considers

2

remaining in the sense of remaining in a placement that

3

has teen put there on paper as opposed to remaining

4

physically in a placement.

5

QUESTION;

Isn't that some support for the

6

position taken by your opponents that the purpose of

7

this subsection of the statute was to prevent the

8

removal by school authorities of a child who was in an

9

effective placement without the consent of the parents?

10

I mean,

11

HR. BERHAN:

12

there is some justification.
That is -- the usa of the word

"remain" is some support for that, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION :

14

HR. BERMAN:

15

Now, the question of damages.

Yes, it is.
Yes, I agree with that.
Oh, before I

16

get to that, the word "agree."

17

that where the parents prevail at the administrative or

18

due process level, as it is sometimes called, there has

19

bean an agreement with respect to placement.

20

I disagree with that.

21

they have written that is to suggest that when Congress

22

said during proceedings under this section, they really

23

meant proceedings under 1415(c).

24

Congress said.

25

1415(c).

Both respondents argue

^hat they have really done when

That is not what

Congress did not say proceedings under

are pending
Now, what the parents really argue, and T

3

think this is the heart of their argument, is that if

4

1415(e)(3) is construed as Congress wrote it, it is

5

unworkable.

6

It will not accomplish its purpose.

But I think there is a fallacy that runs

7

through that argument, and

8

placements are going to be bad; parents are going to be

9

right most of the time, school authorities are going to

10
11

the fallacy is that most

be wrong most of the time.
If you take the reverse of that proposition

12

and assume that most of the time, as was the case here,

13

the school authorities will be right and the parents

14

will be wrong when they disagree, and if you allow room

15

for agreement, for a new interim placement while

16

proceedings are pending, and you allow room, as we think

17

you should,

MR. BERMAN;

That is correct, Your Honor.

And

as far as procedural damages go, everyone talks about
procedure in terms of the statements in Rowley made by

Justice Rehnguist that procedures are at the very heart

6

of this -- of EHA, and I agree with that.

Petitioners

The problem is that when we are talking about
procedures, in Rowley this Court was talking about those

10

procedures in 1415 that were meant to safeguard a

11

parent's right to a due process hearing and the parent's

12

right to obtain information.

13

I don’t believe this Court in Rowley, when it

14

suggested that procedures were at the heart of EHA,

15

meant any, any kind of procedure anywhere, no matter hew

of procedure,

I don’t believe that this is what this Court

meant in Rowley, and I think when the Court of Appeals

On the other hand, Congress intended, as was
