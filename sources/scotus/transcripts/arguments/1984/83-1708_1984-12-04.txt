MR. BELL;

ESQ.,

Mr. Chief Justice,

and

please the Court, this case is here today, I

10

believe, because the District Court did precisely that

which

13

do .

14

this Court subsequently declared in its decision

That is, the District Court undermined

the

15

expectations of the petitioner who desired arbitration

16

pursuant to a contract related to interstate commerce.

This case involves a civil suit filed in the

18

Federal District Court by a customer against the

19

securities broker/dealer.

claims

The complaint asserts four

under state law, all of which are subject tc a
preexisting agreement to arbitrate.
The customer, in addition to asserting these

23

four state law claims, asserts one claim under the

Securities and Exchange Act of 193U.

8

Dickenson theory approach, and that is cne cf the

9

circuits that have decided against intertwining, and it

20

feels that the protections affcrded under the '34 Act

21

are better served by reserving to the federal district

22

court the right of priority to determine the federal

23

securities law claim and thus stay the aribration until

24

that federal securities law claim has in fact been

determined.

MR. BELL:

Again, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

just prior to the adjournment that the Ninth Circuit in

9

similar circuit opinions had caused some legal

10

pro lie ms.

11

I mentioned the language in the Cone case

12

where this Court recited a healthy regard for a federal

13

policy favoring arbitration, and likewise in the Keating

14

case this Court stated that contracts to arbitrate are

15

net to be avoided by allowing one party to ignore the

16

contract and resort to the courts.

Fifth, and
