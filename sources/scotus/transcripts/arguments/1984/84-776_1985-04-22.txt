ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CARCHMAN;

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, the issue presented in the case today

11

is whether the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, a

12

uniform statute adopted by 48 states, the District of

13

Columbia, and the federal government, applies to

14

detainers based on probation and parole violations.
The facts before the Court are quite simple

16

and brief.

Respondent Nash -QUESTION;

The respondent Nash was charged and convicted

3

in New Jersey of various criminal offenses, and as part

4

of his sentence he was sentenced to a jail term.

5

of the sentence was suspended, and he was placed on

6

probation for a period of two years.

7

That is correct, Justice.

Part

While on probation, Nash was charged and

8

convicted in the state of Fennsylvani fer varicus

9

criminal offenses, and was sentenced to a term of five

10
11

The Nercer County probation department issued

12

a warrant of a parole violation, and lodged that warrant

22

in violation of probation, and sentenced the defendant

It is the position of the petitioners that

12

detainers based on probation and parole violations dc

14

not fall within the scope of the IAD.

15

most obvious avenue of inquiry

The first and

is to look at what we

The critical language is found in Article III

17

and elsewhere, but Article III applies to the facts cf

19

this case.
The key language is the phrase, and I quote,

"untried indictment, information, and complaint."

3

MB. CARCBM AN ;

4

We do not feel that the

5

determination should rest on the actual nomenclature

used.

7

nature of the proceeding.
The terms "indictment," "information," and

8
9

It is specifically designed to deal with the

"complaint" refer to the initial stages in the bringing

10

of criminal proceedings, and we contrast this with the

11

probation violation, which is in the nature of a warrant

12

issued by a judicial bcdy as opposed to the executive ,

13

being the prosecuting agency, or a parole revocation

14

which is issued by an administrative agency completely

15

divorced from the prosecution.
QUESTIONi

16

Well,

may I ask, do you think the

17

word "complaint" is something unknown to New Jersey

18

procedures and therefore not within that word -HP. CARCHKAN:

refer to the initiation of criminal proceedings.

criminal trials.

If we look further we see the word "untried"

And the word "trial" is used.

And these are

10

words which refer to a plenary adjudication of criminal

11

charges, and

12

statute use.

13

these are the words that the framers cf the

I contrast that with the hearing procedures

14

which this Co trt discussed

15

when it differentiated between a plenary trial and a

16

probation hearing, and the rights which attach to a

17

trial are significantly different from the riohts which

18

attach to a hearing.

19

in Gagnon versus Scarpelli

There is the issue cf uncertainty as a result,

20

again, the phrase "uncertainty" being used in the

21

statute, and as I will discuss later when we discuss the

22

legislative history, the framers were talking about

23

uncertainty in the first instance as to guilt or

24

innocence, and this is not an issue which will be

25

involved on a probation or parole violation which is

based on a subsequent conviction.
The statute talks abcut notice, and as we

3

examine the notice provisions, we see that notice refers

4

to notice to the prosecuting attorney and to the court.

5

If we take first the example of the parole viclaticn,

6

neither the ccurt nor the prosecuting official is

7

involved in that notice procedure.

8

separate administrative agency who under the terms of

9

the statute will receive no notice.

10

In fact, that is a

In the probation area, the issue is less

11

clearly defined, but we are talking abcut notification

12

to a court and a prosecutor who may or may not,

13

depending on the particular state's practices, be

14

involved in the revocation proceedings.

15

And lastly, the statute talks about speedy

16

trial, and that is a phrase which has been dealt with by

17

this Court on many occasions, and it is a phrase which

18

has specific meaning, not in terms of hearing, but in

19

terms of plenary adjudication.

20

We submit that a reasonable interpretation

cf

21

this particular statute does not allow for construction

22

which will include a probation revocation hearing cr a

23

parole hearing within its scope.

we

submit, could end here, but the legislative history cf

The commentators

have recognized three types of detainers.

I believe the prosecutor has

He seems to think that this Court

That is

The Third Circuit decision upon which

21

certiorari was granted specifically limited its hcldirg

22

to probation violation complaint because of the unique

23

characteristics of a probation violation complaint when

24

compared with the policies and terms of the Act.

1

which certiorari was granted in this case between the

2

Ninth and the Third Circuit therefore is merely based

3

upon the decision to held a probation violation

4

complaint comes within the terms of the Act, so in

5

construing this case, this Court need not consider

6

probation and parole violations taken together.
Even though this Court has recognized that

7

8

there isn’t a constitutional significance between the

9

two when the Court is determining a legal issue for

10

purposes of deciding this case, there are practical

11

distinctions letween the two that make one much more

12

amenable to applications of the Act than the other.
This case juxtaposes the prisoner’s interest

13
14

in the opportunity to participate in rehabilitation

15

programs while serving the prison sentence against the

16

state’s interest in depriving the prisoner of these

17

opport unities because it has lodged a detainer against

18

him.

19

Ncre specifically, it requires the question cf

20

whether a prisoner against whom a probation violation

21

detainer has been lodged can demand a prompt probation

22

revocation hearing under Article III of the Interstate

23

Agreement on Detainers.

24

a probation violation complaint can be considered an

the conclusion that a probation violation complaint is

I am net sure what all states use

by way of terminology, but it appears that many of them

general definition of the word.
