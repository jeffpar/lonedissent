remedial courses for the children who regularly attend

those schools.

New, unlike many cf the religion clause cases

QUESTION*

10

Hi. Ripple, do you take the

position that the standing requirements are satisfied in
this case?

11

MR. RIPPLE*

We do maintain that the standing

12

requirement is not satisfied.

13

that Flast v. Cohen and Valley Forge have not been met

14

by the Plaintiffs in this case, and we also submit that

15

if this Court were inclined to view this as muncipal

16

taxpayers standing, that it is time to review the dicta

17

in the Mellon case.

18

Indeed,

First of all, we believe

it is -- municipal taxpayers standing

19

does,

20

because the fact of the matter is, this program doesn't

21

hurt any taxpayer in that tewn, and there was no prctlem
