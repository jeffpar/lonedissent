We will hear arguments

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court, this is a follow-up to last

10

term’s decision in Puckelshaus against Monsanto Company

11

in which this Court sustained the constitutionality of

12

the data use and disclosure provisions of the federal

13

statute regulating the marketing and sale of pesticides,

14

known as FIFRA.

15

The Court will recall that the data involved

16

are not formulas of pesticide products, but they are

17

health and safety testing data,.and those are used by

18

EPA in granting registrations to subsequent applicants.

19

Under the statutory scheme they are not required to

20

duplicate the testings, but are to share in the cost of

21

generating the test data.

22

There is no issue in the present case with

23

respect to public disclosure of the data.

That portion

24

of FIFRA is not involved here, because the compensation

25

scheme which is at issue does not relate to public

EPA in support of the subsequent application.

3

It relates only to use of the data within

The subsequent applicant is not given access

4

to the data for that purpose.

5

existence of such data from an index.

6

He merely cites the

This Court last term held that the District

7

Court had acted prematurely in the Monsanto case in

8

holding that the system for sharing the costs of

9

generating the data, the system of compulsory

10

arbitration that is provided for if the parties cannot

11

reach agreement violated Article 3 of the Constitution.

12

The Court held that that issue was not ripe

14

case, and the District Court held that that issue was

15

ripe in the present case, and that those previsions did

16

violate Article 3, and enjoined the enforcenent of the

17

entire licensing, if one might call it that, and

18

compensation system for registering subsequent

19

applicants, and tha case is on appeal from' that

20

holding.

not ripe with respect to Monsanto.
And our first contention is that here,

too,

3

the issue is not ripe for adjudication, but we also have

4

contentions on the merits to follow through with.

5

The guestion as to whether it is ripe with

6

respect to Stauffer Chemical Company is only a little

7

more complicated, but we believe that the same result

8

should follow.

9

Stauffer has been a party to cne arbitration

10

proceeding under the statute against PPG Industries, but

11

Stauffer has not either in the present case or in a case

12

that is pending between the two companies in the

13

District Court for the Distr-ict of Columbia contested

14

the result of that arbitration award as not meeting the

15

statutory standard.

16

The Court said in the Monsanto case that the

17

operation of the arbitration procedure affects only in

18

that case Monsanto’s ability to vindicate its statutory

19

right to obtain compensation.

20

It is PPG which claims that Monsanto has been

21

overccmpensated by the artibrator’s award, and while

22

Monsanto is asking that the entire system of allowing a

23

competitor a registration be struck down so that it can

24

still market its no longer patented product free of

25

competition, it is not asking that the award be set

2

aside or augmented in any way.
Presumably this is a tactical decision to

3

restrict the scopa of review, and I think if one turns

4

to the award itself, one can understand that it is

5

really Stauffer that has won the award for all practical

6

purposes, and at least is taking that stance in the

7

proceedings.

8
9

I should point out that the District Court in
this case on remand, and this is printed at Page 30 of

10

the Jcint Appendix,

11

plaintiffs do not in this case challenge the result of

12

an arbitration, nor does the adjudication of plaintiff *s

13

claims depend in any manner on the outcome of an

14

arbitration.

15

the appellees specifically said that

And in the case pending in the District Court

16

for the District of Columbia, Stauffer is asking for

17

enforcement of the award, or in the alternative, that

18

PPG not be allowed to market the product at all, and

19

that Stauffer be awarded damages in the amount of the

20

arbitrator's award.

21

The award is set forth in the Joint Appendix,

22

and if one turns to Page

23

can see what was awarded to Stauffer by the

24

arbitrators.

25

Paragraph A awards the sum of $1,465,000, which is

54

of the Joint Appendix, one

There are two elements to the award.

explained two page earlier to be one-half the sum of

2

$2,93C,000, which was the cost generated in getting the

3

data that were submitted to EPA.

4

And then there is the plus. Part B, running

5

compensation for the calendar years 1983 through

6

15 cents per pound, for every pound of product that PPG

7

sells, and there is a fraction there which is intended

8

to be an inflation adjustment, which so long as the

9

Consumer Price Index continues to rise will have the

10

1992 cf

effect of increasing the 15 cents slightly.

11

And on the preceding page, Page 53, the

12

arbitrators estimated that during the first five years

13

of that ten-year period, PPG would sell 47,250,000

14

pounds.

15

about £7 million, and that is only for the first five cf

16

the ten years.

17

would exceed the total cost of generating the data many

18

times ever.

19

If one multiplies that by 15 cents, it comes to

Obviously, added to the $1,465,000, it

Now, our own view of the legislative history

20

set ferth on Page 4 of the reply brief that we have

21

filed in this case indicates that Congress was guite

22

clear that it meant the awards in these cases to be a

23

device for sharing the cost cf generating the data and

24

not to include something extraneous which is really in

25

the nature of a patent royalty.

Even though there has been no claim that a

1
2

patented process was used in generating these test data,

3

we don’t know of any instance in which anyone has gotten

4

a patent on any process used in generating the data.
QUESTION;

5
6

Hr. Wallace, are you suggesting

that Part B of the -award is improper?
QUESTION;

7

That is the view that we have taken

8

about what the proper statutory standard is, but the

9

Court — I am not saying the Court should reach that

10

question.
Ny point is that there may well be reason why

11
12

Stauffer would be fearful of having the question of

13

modifying the award or setting it aside addressed in

14

Court, because Stauffer, while it made a larget claim to

15

the arbitrators, has steadfastly refrained from making

16

an effort to set aside or augment the award in any court

17

because it would imply that the award could be modified

18

in the other direction.
QUESTION;

19

Well, Hr. Wallace, how much

20

judicial review of permitted of these awards from the

21

statute?

22

HR. WALLACE;

That is the question at issue in

23

the District Court for the District of Columbia in the

24

case between Stauffer and PPG, and we have not taken a

25

position on that precise question yet.

QUESTION

I thought the statute limited it to

fraud.

3

SR. WALLACE;

Well, we thought the same thing

4

in a case decided last Wednesday, Lindahl against the

5

Office of Personnel Management, but statutes are subject

6

to construction on the question of the scope of judicial

7

review, and —

Well, it was a construction of

that particular statutory provision.

Wallace?

16

(General laughter.)

17

MR. WALLACE;

As it happens, in this

18

particular arbitration award, the arbitrators themselves

19

suggested a scope of judicial review that is perhaps

20

debatable under this statute in Footnote 1 on Page 43 of

21

the Joint Appendix.

22

They say misconduct within the meaning of the

23

judicial review provisions on the part of the

24

arbitrators can include their acting in excess of their

25

powers or perversely misconstruing the law, which would
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

suggest some review of legal questions in a reviewing

2

court.

3

QUESTION;

A little broader than just fraud.

4

MR. WALLACE;

That is correct, and the statute

5

does say that the awards are reviewable only for fraud,

6

misrepresentation, or misconduct on the part of the

7

parties or the arbitrators, which leaves --

/

QUESTION;

8
9

Well, what puzzles me about that

footnote, that kind of assumes there is a law to be

10

applied In determining the amount, and I don *t know what

11

that law the arbitrator is supposed to apply is.

12

statute doesn't contain any standards at all, does it?
MR. WALLACE;

13

The

Well, we have pointed out on

14

Page 4 of our reply brief that the legislative history

15

seems just quite clear that the compensation provision

16

is intended to effect an equitable sharing of the costs

17

of generating the data.
The theory of the statute is that it is

18
19

economically inefficient to require a subsequent

20

application for a registration of the same pesticide to

21

have to go through the whole testing procedure over

22

again and incur in this case more than $2 million of

23

costs.

24
25

QUESTION;

It was that part of your brief

together with your argument that made me wonder whether
10

(202) 628-9300

1

you were questioning Part B of the award

2

MB. WALLACE;

Well, what -- for purposes of

3

this case, obviously the accuracy of the award is net at

4

issue.

5

sufficient basis for questioning Part B of the award,

6

that it seems to us not at all inadvertent that Stauffer

7

has net sought to have the award set aside or modified

8

in any way, and is steadfastly taking the position that

9

the award should be enforced as is if it cannot prevent

What I am pointing out is that there is a

10

competition altogether within the statutory scheme.

11

Stauffer has not in any —

12

QUESTION;

It is your position that you have a

13

right to question B, but you haven't got any place to

14

question it, any forum.
MR. WALLACE;

15
16

this next case.
QUESTION;

17
18

Well, that is to be litigated in

What forum are you going to

question it in?
MR. WALLACE;

19

Well, that is now in the

20

District Court for the District of Columbia, Justice

21

Marshall.

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. WALLACE;

Well, it is not here.
It is not here, no.

What is

24

here is whether Stauffer is in a different position from

25

Monsanto last term with respect to ripeness of the
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Article 3 issue, and Stauffer says, yes, they have

2

suffered injury and are seeking redress for that injury

3

because they claimed more before the arbitrators than

4

the arbitrators gave them.
But they have not sought to upset the

5

6

arbitrator's award either in this case or in the case

7

where they have an opportunity to seek to do that in the

8

District Court for the District of Columbia.

9

They are standing by that award.

The only

10

possible outcome of that case could be to diminish the

11

award or to keep the award as it is, so Stauffer is not

12

taking the position that the award doesn’t fully reflect

13

what they are entitled to within the meaning of the

14

compensation provision of the statute.
So, they are not in. a position where they have

15
16

been injured by an award and are seeking redress for

17

that injury.

18

position is really no different from Monsanto's.

19

~~

That is our plight on ripeness.

QUESTION*

Their

Mr. Wallace, may I ask you -- maybe

20

this is foreign to this case, but I would be very much

21

interested in your answer.

22

Supposing a party who is ordered to pay an

23

award, not the subsequent data, thinks the award is too

24

high, and doesn't like the review it gets.

25

refuse to pay, and just withdraw its registration?

Kay it

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

Or

is it committed, so that it has to pay?
NR. WALLACE;

Well, under the statute,

they

can start marketing prior to the resolution of the
compensation issue,

so they can market once they have

the registration, and if they have made an offer to
compensate, no matter how long it then takes to resolve
the amount of compensation.
And if they have entered the market and
actually sold the product, I think it would be hard for
them to pull back, but of course this has never been
resolved.

This particular arbitration award is the only

one that has occurred so far, and it is being contested
in the District Court for the District of Columbia.
So, I can’t really give you a definitive
answer.

If they had not yet marketed the product, if

they had just gotten a registration, I don’t see that
they fcould have incurred any liability.
That is a common practice that people are
getting the me-too registrations for products while they
are still under patent, with the idea of being ready,
having the federal approval to market the product when
the patent expires.
Stauffer had a patent on this particular
product which has expired, and PPG is marketing the
prod uct.
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Well, factually, the case is obviously a

2

little different from previous ripeness cases that the

3

Court has had, but we think, it falls within the

4

principle that this kind of constitutional challenge

5

should not be heard by a party who doesn't show injury

6

in fact and isn't seeking redress for that injury.

7

QUESTION;

Well, it is really not a question

of lack of ripeness as to Stauffer.

to have the award confirmed.
MR. WALLACE;

That is our position.

Stauffer

12

has tc be taking the position that it has gotten less

13

compensation than what it was entitled to.

14

the ripeness holding was that perhaps the arbitration

15

would meet the statutory standard, and it was

16

speculative to assume that it would not.

17

The point of

And if Stauffer is not in Court taking

position that the one arbitration it has had did not

22

refused to take that position, even though it has had

23

the opportunity to do so in two courts.

24
25

then it is in the same

It just happens that it had an

That is our point.

And Stauffer has.

Now, beyond the fact that we think the issue
is not ripe for review in this case, and that should end

(202) 628-9300

1

the case, in the event the Court or some members of the

2

Court may disagree with us, then we do think that on the

3

merits the District Court erred, and that there is

4

nothing incompatible with Article 3 of the Constitution

5

and this statutory scheme.

6

In our view,

this question does not require

t

7

the Court to consider the broad spectrum of issues that

8

were discussed in the Northern Pipeline case.

9

falls at one end of the spectrum.

10

This case

It is not merely that the case does not

11

involve a common law type of claim under state law, but

12

the fact of the matter is, this case not only involves a

13

claim only under a federal statute creating a recently

14

claimed right, a recently created right, but it involves

15

a relationship between the two parties which itself

16

would not exist were it not for the federal statute.

17

The very relationship between the two parties

18

is a creature of the federal statute.

19

people who are doing business with one another.

20

don't have a relationship that could give rise to a

21

claim.

22

in selling an unpatented product which itself would not

23

give rise to a legal claim.

24
25

These are not

All that is happening is that they are competing

The nearest analogy would be under a state law
of unfair competition, but obviously it cannot violate

state law merely to compete in the sale of an unpatented

product.
The federal antitrust laws and patent laws

3

would preclude that kind of a state law.

4

QUESTION*

Mr. Wallace, would you characterize

5

the rights of the claimants here as public or private

6

rights?

7

MR. WALLACE;

Well, they don't fit

8

conveniently into either of those labels.

The right

9

immediately .at issue is not a right against the

10

government, which is the way the public rights doctrine

11

was described in Northern Pipeline.

12

On the other hand, it is only the government

13

that is using the testing data for purposes of

14

conferring the second registration, and the statutory

15

scheme is based on the idea that the public will benefit

16

from competition, that the public health and safety will

17

be adequately provided for without duplication of the

18

testing, if the testing was adequately done in the first

19

place, but that the innovator who went through the

20

testing should not be discouraged from that, and should

21

have the costs shared with the competing registrant who

22

is going to enter the market and compete against him.

23

All of that is for a public purpose, and the

24

duty to compensate arises wholly from the statute, and

25

the use of the data arises wholly from the statute.
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

Congress could have said that once we have registered a

2

particular pesticide product on the basis of test data

3

by the innovator, anyone else is free without a

4

registration to market that product so long as it isn’t

5

patented.

6

Congress conditioned the ability to market

7

that product on a sharing of the test generating costs,

and that is the sole basis for the claim here.

9

creature of statute, and what Congress conferred on the

It is a

10

original applicant was the right to get a share of those

11

costs as determined by the arbitrators, and there is

12

nothing in Article 3 under the analysis taken in any of

13

the opinions in Northern Pipeline that precludes that.

14

In fact —

15

QUESTION;

You don’t think that these lock

16

like the kind of private federally created rights that

17

require adjudication as

plurality opinion?

20

NR. WALLACE;

to law and procedural issues in

Well, we think not.

We think

21

that it instead comes squarely within the exception that

22

was recognized on Page 83 of that opinion for a

23

statutory right created by Congress which prescribed

24

specific remedies and provides the person seeking to

25

vindicate that right must do so before particularized

tribunals, and it goes on to describe that.

We have

2

quoted that paragraph on Pages 21 and 22 of our brief.

3

It says that such provisions do, in a sense,

4

affect the exercise of judicial power, tut they are also

5

incidental to Congress's power to define the right that

6

it has created, and the only right to compensation that

7

Congress created here was the right either to agree on

8

compensation between the parties or to get it from this

9

tribunal of arbitrators as they would see fit to

10
11

equitably divide the costs of generating the test data.
And both parties would be better off than if

12

each one had to bear the cost of generating such

13

data cn their own, which is part of the reason that

14

Congress sought to confer this on arbitrators.

that up.

the Article 3 courts of any adjudicatory power over this

all matters of fact and law in the adjudication of money

claims which in Crowell versus Benson and in Northern

rights.

The arbitrators have full authority to decide

That is an exercise of the judicial power of

11

the United States, deciding money claims for the use of

12

trade secrets.

13

I would like to deal .with one final point in

14

my argument, and that is, assuming that the statute is

15

unconstitutional, and that the Article 3 defects exist,

16

what should be done about it?

17

Our position here is not that Congress does

18

not have the power to require the licensing of these

19

data, and we don’t say that Congress doesn’t have a lot

20

to say about how it ought tc be adjudicated.

21

22

All we are saying is, the system

that Congress

enacted here transgresses the limits of Article 3, and
\

23

it is up to Congress to find a way to do it that is

24

consistent with Article 3 and that meets its purposes.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGES;

4

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Wallace?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE GOULD WALLACE, ESQ.,

5

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT - REBUTTAL

7

MR. WALLACE;

If it please, Mr. Chief Justice,

8

the difference that we see between Stauffer and Marathon

9

with respect to the ripeness issue is that Marathon

10

wanted its contract claim decided by another tribunal,

11

whereas Stauffer has resisted any effort to get a

12

redetermination of what compensation it is entitled

13

to .

14

It is defending the arbitrator's award with

15

respect to that question.

It still wants to exclude its

16

competitors rather than accept compensation, but is not

17

attempting to get to the question of what compensation

18

the statute gives it a right to decide! by anyone else.

19

Now, it is commonplace for tribunals that are

20

not Article 3 courts to make monetary awards for back

21

pay under the National Labor Relations Act for workmen's

22

compensation and so forth.

23
24
25

QUESTION*

That always arises out of a

contract, doesn't it?
MR. WALLACE;

These are claims between persons
45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

where there is a claim of a breach of rights under a

2

contract.
QUESTION;

3

Is that any different from two

4

private parties agreeing under the Federal Arbitration

5

Act?

6

MR. WALLACE;

I am not speaking of

7

arbitration.

I am speaking of a decision of the

8

National Labor Relations Board itself which would

9

warrant back pay to someone.

10

QUESTION;

That is subject to review.

11

MR. WALLACE;

That is subject to review.

But

12

it isn’t that the tribunal making the determination has

13

to be an Article 3 court.

14

problem here it is with the limitation of judicial

15

review, and the statute is both capable of a saving

16

construction or of severability of the limitation on

17

review should the Court concluded that a saving

18

construction is not available.

19
20
21

QUESTIONi

If there is any Article 3

And there is limited judicial

review of NLRB decisions.
MR. WALLACE;

That is correct, and of

22

workmen’s compensation decisions, and even more so of VA

23

decisions and other kinds, but the point is that there

24

is no need to describe the essence of the scheme that

25

Congress created.

QUESTIONS

Now, what would this surgery be

precisely, if you will restate that?

3

NR, WALLACE;

It would just be to provide for

4

as extensive judicial review as would be required, or

5

just to drop the provision limiting the scope of

6

judicial review, and have it the kind of judicial review

7

that existed under the 1972 Act.
QUESTION;

8
9

In what court would you do this?

The Court of Appeals or the District Court?

10

NR. WALLACE;

It would be — the District

11

Court would review an arbitration award, just as it

12

could entertain an action under 1331 to enforce an

13

arbitration award.

14
15

QUESTION;

Over across the park they would

think we were amending their statute, wouldn't they?
MR. WALLACE;

16

Well, it amends it a great deal

17

more to do what the District Court did, which was to say

18

exactly the opposite of what Congress intended, that

19

competitors cannot market these unpatented products

20

during the 15-year period for which Congress provided

21

for a sharing of the costs.
