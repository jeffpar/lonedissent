CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERt

Mr.

Peterson, I think you may proceed whenever

you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. PETERSON, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR.

EETERSGNs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, in March of 1983, Robert Snyder was

10

appointed under the CJA Act to represent an indigent in

11

a federal criminal case.

12

that year, and in August of 1983, Robert Synder

13

submitted a request for payment.

14

This case was tried in May of

The District Judge approved that request for

15

the most part, and it was then sent on to the Circuit

16

Court of Appeals for final approval.

17

In September of that same year an

18

administrative secretary of the Circuit Court sent a

19

memorandum to the District Judge’s office and asked that

20

there be a detailed memorandum submitted to support

21

payment beyond the $1,000 amount under the CJA Act.

22

QUESTIONS

When you refer to an administrative

23

secretary, someone in the clerk’s office or someone

24

attached to a

secretary for Judge Lay, the Chief Judge of the Circuit,

2

Your Honor.

3

The memorandum from the administrative

4

secretary was given to Judge Van Sickle, and she took

5

the matter up with hr. Snyder.

6

additional records to the District Judge's secretary,

7

which additional records included his computer printouts

8

for his billing.

9

Mr. Snyder then sent in

The administrative secretary of the Eighth

10

Circuit, upon receiving that, made yet another request

11

to the District Judge's secretary, returning the

12

voucher, stating essentially in that memorandum that the

13

information required under the Act was there but she

14

didn't particularly prefer it in that form.

15

The Eighth Circuit secretary's request was

16

again given to Mr. Snyder, and Mr. Synder discussed it

17

with the District Judge's secretay.

18

suggested that Mr. Snyder write a letter to her stating

19

his concerns regarding his frustrations and the

20

frustrations of a counsel in representing indigents and

21

getting their compensation for that representation.

22

The secretary

Mr. Synder wrote a letter to this District

23

Judge's secretary on October 6th of 1983, which letter

24

has brought us to this Court today.

25

letter I believe is important enough for me to read it.

The content of that

It is not very long, and it stated*
"I am in receipt of the letter of September

2
3

26th, 1983, from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in

4

which our latest attempt to justify our time and

5

expenses for Dennis Darren again have been sent back.
"This letter is for the purpose of responding

to triat letter .
"In

8
9

the first place,

I am appalled by the

amount of money which the Federal Court pays for

10

indigent criminal defense work.

The reason that so few

11

attorneys in Eismarck accept this work is for that exact

12

reason.

13

indigent appointments because of a duty to our

14

profession and the fact that nobody else will do it.

We have up to this point still accepted the

15

"Now, however, not only are we paid an amount

16

of money which does not even cover our overhead, but we

17

have to go through extreme gynmastics even to receive

18

the puny amounts which the federal courts authorize for

19

this work.

20

"We have sent you everything we have

21

concerning our representation, and I am not sending you

22

anything else.

23

You can take it or leave it.

"Further, I am extremely disgusted by the

24

treatment of

us by the Eighth Circuit in this case, and

25

you are instructed to remove my name from the list of

work.

I have simply had it.
"Thank you for your time and attention.

Very

truly yours."
QUESTION*

Mr. Peterson, would you think that

6

that same message could have been communicated in more

7

respectful, diplomatic terms?

8
9
10
11

MR.

PETERSON*

There is no doubt, Your Honor,

that different authors attempting to put across the same
point could have said it in a more diplomatic fashion.
The District Court's secretary discussed this

12

letter with Mr. Synder, and then the District Judge

13

discussed the letter with Mr. Snyder.

14

Judge, after that discussion with Mr. Snyder, directed

15

his secretary to send that letter on to the Eighth

16

Circuit Court cf Appeals.

The District

17

The

18

the record in

19

the letter as one of disrespect for the court, but

20

rather one of a somewhat frustrated lawyer hoping that

21

his comments might be viewed as a basis for some change

22

in the process."

23

District Judge has stated, and it is in
this case, and

I quote, "I did not view

The Circuit Court, however, obviously viewed

24

the letter differently, and the Chief Judge wrote to the

25

District Judge stating that he questioned whether or not

Snyder should

The Chief Judge then approved the fee request

5

6

to the extent cf the $1,000 statutory limit, and

7

returned it to the District Court office.
In addition, the Chief Judge wrote another

8
9

letter to the District Court stating that if Mr. Synder

10

would apologize to the court for his disrespectful

11

remarks, and that he would in the future comply with the

12

CJA Act and th'e guidelines, that the Chief Judge would

13

then recommend that a show cause order not be issued by

14

the Eighth Circuit and become a matter of public

15

record.

16

The District Judge talked to Mr. Snyder at

17

that point and wrote to the Chief Judge after that

18

conversation advising the Chief Judge that Mr. Snyder

19

saw his letter as an expression of honest opinion and an

20

exercise of his right of freedom of speech, and that he

21

has decided not to apologize.

22

A show cause order was then issued directing

23

Mr. Snyder to show cause why he should not be suspended

24

from practice, and I quote,

25

his refusal to serve continues."

"for such period of time as

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

Mr. Snyder responded, pointing out that the

1

2

Criminal Justice Act plan in effect in North Dakota at

3

that time which had been approved by the Eighth Circuit

4

Court of Appeals in the 1960*s was indeed and in fact a

5

voluntary plan.

6

In other words, it specifically stated that

7

only those lawyers that agreed to serve had to serve.

8

He farther pointed out that he had absolutely nothing

9

but the greatest respect for the federal courts.
A hearing was had before the Circuit panel,

10
11

and that panel consisted of the Chief Judge and two

12

other judges of that court.

13

make a request that the hearing be an en banc hearing,

14

and further requested that the Chief Judge recuse

15

himself, both cf those requests were denied.

Even though Sr. Snyder did

At the hearing, the Circuit Court soon

16
17

recognized that the CJA plan in Korth Dakota was indeed

18

and in fact a voluntary plan.

19

they then turned to the issue of the tone of the

20

letter.

21

requested of Mr. Snyder whether or not he was indeed at

22

that point going to apologize for the tone of the

23

letter.

24
25

And when that occurred,

Judge Arnold specifically at the hearing

Mr.

Snyder declined, indicating that that was

not the reason stated in the show cause order for his
8

(202) 628-9300

appearance before the court, that he had been asked
previously by Chief Judge Lay to apologize and had
respectfully declined.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Peterson, was it clear at this

stage that the Court of Appeals was relying on the
Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 46(c)?
MR.

PETERSONs

Forty-six had not been included

in the order tc show cause, Your Honor.
QUESTIONS

If 46 is not it, what did the Court

of Appeals suggest was the authority under which it was
acting?
MR. PETERSONs

In reading the order to show

cause, they cited a case. Justice Rehnguist, which
related to the fact that they had in a previous case
indicated that counsel had a duty to serve on indigent
cases, and that was basically the essence of the order
to show cause, that you have somehow violated your duty
by wanting your name taken off this list of persons who
represent indigent counsel.
QUESTIONj

I would think if you violate your

duty that might well be a basis for the Court of Appeals
to take some action against you, but you would still
want to know what was the basis that the Court of
Appeals thought empowered it to suspend or to
discipline?

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. PETERSON;

I can only refer you. Justice

2

Rehnquist, to the order to show cause which specifically

3

told him to shew cause why he shouli not be suspended

4

for refusing tc continue to serve indigents.
QUESTION*

5

6

the sole issue before the court at that time?

7
8

And you take the view that that was

MR.

PETERSON*

That is our position, Your

Honor.
QUESTION*

9

Well, then, how does Judge Arnold's

10

phrase come in, which is where you were in your argument

11

when you were interrupted?
MR. PETERSONs

12

Justice Marshall, Judge Arnold,

13

after the return and Mr. Snyder's oral appearance at the

14

panel hearing that day specifically pointed out that

15

under the North Dakota plan it was a voluntary situation.
That is when Judge Arnold then, and the

16
17

transcript is in the appendix, he said, then, I want to

18

turn to this letter, and the tone of the letter that was

19

written to Judge Van Sickle's secretary on October 6th.

20

j

And from that point forward until today. Your

21

Honor, this case has been a free speech case,

22

notwithstanding the fact that the Eighth Circuit in

23

their response in this case have tried to remove it from

24

a First Amendment case and into the area of conduct

25

rather than speech.

(202) 628-9300

QUESTION:

1

Well, Mr. Peterson, before you get

2

to the First Amendment in a case like this,

3

ordinarily a presumption that people, Congress, this

4

Court,

5

rules that authorize suspension are aware of the First

6

Amendment, and that you may not have to get to any

7

constitutional question.

8

of interpreting the rules.

9

there is

the Judicial Conference, when they promulgate

MR. PETERSON:

Perhaps it is just a question

Your Honor, that very well may

10

be true, and I think that the Court -- this Court in the

11

Sawyer case specifically declined to get to the First

12

Amendment and reversed a lower court's opinion

13

suspending a lawyer who I would submit the record in

14

that case indicates that her conduct was far more

15

egregious than what is in this case.

16

QUESTION:

But that was a state — wasn't that

17

a state proceeding in Sawyer, or was that a federal

18

proceeding?

19

MR. PETERSON:

20

of the State of Hawaii.

That was a state proceeding out

21

QUESTION:

You would have to get to the First

22

Amendment, I think,

23

because you can't do it on a statutory or rule basis.

24

The states are the final arbiters of how their rules are

25

interpreted.

to reverse a state proceeding

But here you are in the federal system,
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

and certainly this Court can speak with some authority

2

on the meaning of the Federal Rules of Appellate

3

Procedure.
MS.

4

PETERSON:

That is indeed correct, Justice

5

Rehnquist, and I agree that this Court could reverse

6

what has occurred to Mr. Snyder without reaching the

7

constitutional issues that we have addressed in our

8

brief and are attempting to address in this argument.
QUESTION:

9
10

You are mainly doing it on the due

process, on the notice aspect?
MR. PETERSON:

11

Well, I think under the

12

supervisory powers of this court even over the lower

13

courts,

14

Courts.

the Courts of Appeals and tie Federal District

15

QUESTION:

Then you would be going to the

16

merits, not to the procedure.

17

MR. PETERSON:

18

QUESTION:

That’s correct.

Remarkably, your brief as I read it

19

really just starts right in talking about the

20

constitutional issues, the arguments. First Amendment,

21

due process, and as is so often the case, nobody stops

22

to ask whether there is some other non-constitutional

23

ground which might dispose of the case.

24
25

Are you going to argue any non-constitutional
ground, or do

you just rely entirely on the
12

1

Constitution ?

SR.

3

QUESTION;

PETERSON;

Hall, Your Honor, our —

If there were no constitution,

4

would you think this discipline was entirely

appropriate?

Is that your position?

6

SR. PETERSON;

QUESTION;

8

SR.

9

Absolutely not. Your Honor.

But you don't make the argument.

PETERSON:

He believe that the First

Amendment concept is certainly —
QUESTION;

10

Your client is really interested in

11

having a First Amendment case made out of this incident,

12

isn't he?

13

MR. PETERSON:

Well, my client is most

14

interested. Your Honor, in having what he believes is an

15

injustice to him reversed, and as I have indicated in my

16

response to Justice Rehnguist, I think that the Court

17

could do that without even getting to the First

18

Amendment issue.

19

QUESTION;

All the lawyers on this brief, a

20

whole flock of them, none of them thought to make a

21

nonconstitutional argument in this case.

22

MR.

PETERSON:

Well, Your Honor, I don't agree

23

that none of us thought we couldn't make a

24

non-constitutional argument.

25

Our considered opinion was based not only on
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

what had occurred in this case,

2

through the amicus and so forth that this issue

3

regarding First Amendment rights and lawyers’ speech in

4

relationship to the courts is one that needs to have

5

some direction, and hopefully from this Court.

6

QUESTION*

but input we have had

Sell, Mr. Peterson, if you were

7

going to make a non-constitutional argument, what would

8

you rest it on?

9

MR.

PETERSON*

The non-constitutional

10

argument, Justice O’Connor, would rest upon the basis

11

that simply the facts of this case do not warrant the

12

extreme sanction which was given Mr. Snyder, which was

13

the suspension of his right to practice in the court.

14

And it is interesting to note that it was not

15

just a term suspension, that he would automatically be

16

reinstated, but that he had to reapply, and we can only

17

surmise that upon reapplying the request would have

18

been, will you now apologize?

19

20ESTI0Ns

Would your approach in response to

20

Justice O’Connor’s question be something in the nature

21

of confession and avoidance in the sense that it may

22

have been an unwise,

23

not a contemptuous or disrespectful letter?

24
25

MR.

even a foolish letter, but it was

PETERSON*

That may be a fair

characterization, Mr. Chief Justice.

Our problem is,

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the Eighth Circuit has indicated, apparently, that a

2

disrespectful letter, whatever that is, is grounds for

3

suspension, and that is simply such a vague basis, and

4

it is clearly demonstrated by virtue of the fact that

5

the District Judge to whom — to whose secretary this

6

letter was initially written has said in an affidavit

7

which is in the record that he didn’t find this

8

disrespectful, but the Eighth Circuit says that it was.
And because they a re a higher court, Mr.

9
10

Snyder finds himself suspended from practice not only in

11

the Eighth Circuit but also in Ms. Van Sickle's court.
QUESTION*

12

13

way.
MR.

14
15
16

Has that order been stayed, by the

PETERSON*

It has. Your Honor, by Justice

Blackmu n.
QUESTION*

Well, I suppose even if you are

17

arguing a non-constitutional basis under Rule 46, that

18

how you construe and apply that rule might be

19

considerably affected by the fact that there are First

20

Amendment concerns in the wings, and that you should

21

avoid some constitutional issue.

22

MR.

PETERSON:

There is no question. Justice

23

White, in our mind, at least, that under Rule 46, the

24

federal courts have the power to discipline lawyers.

25

Our concern is that if that power is going to be
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

exercised, there needs to be some kind of guideline so

2

that the lawyer and the court both know and can apply tc

3

a given factual situation —

5

QUESTION;

avoid First Amendment constitutional issues.
NR.

6
7

8
9

Certainly a guideline that would

PETERSONs

That is correct. Justice

Blackmun.
We believe that the circuit decisions which
are also a part of the record clearly indicate that in

10

those opinions, Hr. Snyder was suspended because of his

11

— the so-called disrespect indicated in his letter, and

12

for his refusal to apologize for what the Eighth Circuit

13

determined was disrespect.

14

The Eighth Circuit contends, as I understand

15

their argument, that he was not suspended for that, but

16

indeed he in fact was suspended for failure to comply

17

with the CJA guidelines.

18

QUESTION:

When he concluded his letter "take

19

it or leave it," do you suggest that was a respectful

20

way to address the judicial branch of the government?

21

MR. PETERSON:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Well, Your Honor —

I am talking about the terms now,

not the substance, the language.
HR.

PETERSON:

Certainly again I must confess

that it could have been put in less stringent terms, but
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

I don't think that that lessens the fact that he had the

2

right to say what he did.

3

is a question as to whether or not it was indeed

4

directed to the coart.

\

I further believe that there

It was directed at the request of the

5

6

secretary.

She said write me a letter about your

7

concerns, and she has so stated, and the affidavit is in

8

the record.
QUESTIONS

9

And you say he was addressing the

10

system and not the judge, that is, the system of

11

appointment of counsel?

12

that —
MR.

13
14

That is correct, Mr. Chief
1

Justice .
QUESTIONS

15
16

PETERSONs

Somewhere in your brief I get

One thing that came out of his

letter was a change in the system.
MR.

17

PETERSONs

That is exactly right, Justice

18

White.

19

indicates that the Eighth Circuit determined after

20

reviewing the plan that that plan needed some revision,

21

and they directed the Judicial Council and the District

22

Court to in cooperation with the bar associations

23

attempt to revise the plan.

24
25

As a matter of fact, the opinion clearly

So,

I think that one might query as to whether

or not had Mr. Snyder said everything very respectfully,
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

it may not have even gotten to the point where anyone

2

would have paid any attention to it, and so perhaps if

3

he had not used the strident language, the deficiencies

4

in the plan might not have been discovered, and the

5

attempt to revise and reinstitute that plan would not

6

have occurred,
QUESTION*

7

Here is a difficult question.

8

Perhaps you aren't qualified to answer it.

But do you

9

think it is possible that if he was addressing that

10

letter to the Chief Judge of the Court rather than to in

11

effect a clerk or a staff member, he might have had a

12

different tone to the letter?
SR. PETERSON;

13
14

1 cannot answer that question,

Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION;

15

One would ordinarily be a little

16

more careful addressing a letter "Dear Chief Judge Lay"

17

rather than "Dear Ms. Perkins" or whatever.
MR.

18
19

21

that the suspension of Robert Snyder for writing what

22

has been adjudged by the Eighth Circuit to be a

23

disrespectful letter to a Federal District Judge's

24

secretary does present this Court with an issue critical

to the legal profession.

the First Amendment rights that individuals have,

to Ms. Monteith’s affidavit also bears on his

represent indigents, because she points out that he has

always been willing to accept his share and more of the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. GREER, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FCR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT - RESUMED

6
7

MR.

GREER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8

please the Court, it seems that Rule 46 is questioned by

9

the petitioner.

We take the position that Rule 46 is

10

not vague, that it has been workable since the Rules of

11

Civil Procedure have been adopted, and that it is the

12

instrument to have conformity in the respective federal

13

courts, including this one, and we refer, of course, tc

14

your Rule 33.7.

15

If responsibility is to be placed upon the

16

Chief Justice and the Chief Judge for administration of

17

the courts, he has to have power coupled with that to at

18

least regulate performance in the court.

19

The bottom line, it seems to me,

out of all of

20

this travail,

is what factually has occurred in total

21

and what factually should be appraised in total,

22

the judicial approach should face it.

'QUESTIONS

Don’t you think it is rather

extraordinary for a person to be suspended by a Court of
Appeals for writing a letter to a functionary in the
District Court where neither the functionary nor the
District Court thought that anything untoward had been
done, and then somehow the Court of Appeals finds out
about this letter that has been written to the District
Court?

Does the Court of Appeals usually take it upon

itself to second guess the District Judge as to what
warrants some kind of penalty?
