OPAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN IRA HOROWITZ, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6
7

Mr. Horowitz, I think

MR. HOROWITZ;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court;

8

The Attorney General has provided by

9

regulation that completed deportation proceedings may be

10

reopened in his discretion to account for new

11

circumstances.

12
13

QUESTION;
isn 't it?

14
15

Mr. Horowitz, that's by regulation,

MR. HOROWITZ;

Yes.

There's nothing in the

statute.
QUESTION;

16

And I suppose the Service could —

17

the Attorney General could revoke that regulation if he

18

wanted to?

19

MR. HOROWITZ;

20

QUESTION;

21

MR. HOROWITZ;

That's right.

Withdraw it?
It's possible that Congress

22

might want to do something about it at that point, but

23

certainly it's within the Attorney General's authority

24

to revoke the regulation, and the fact that he himself

25

promulgated it suggests that the Attorney General is the
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

one who knows what it means and that he has considerable

2

discretion in how it is to be applied.

3

In addition. Congress has granted the Attorney

4

General discretion to suspend the deportation of a

5

deportable alien who meets certain threshold criteria.

6

In this case, Respondents have sought to reopen their

7

deportation proceedings in order to seek suspension of

8

deportation.

9

The question in this case is whether in

10

exercising his twin discretion that I have described the

11

Attorney General could take into account the fact that

12

Respondents achieved eligibility, this threshold

13

eligibility, for suspension of deportation only by

14

filing frivolous appeals and engaged in other conduct

15

flouting our immigration laws.

16

The Court of Appeals found that the Attorney

17

General abused his discretion by taking these factors

18

into account.

19

this ruling threatens substantial disruption of our

20

immigration processes.

21

We have sought certiorari here because

QUESTION*

Mr. Horowitz, you agree that the

22

proper standard for review is the abuse of discretion

23

standard?

24
25

MR. HOROWITZ*

I would agree that that is the

proper standard of review.

We think that it is quite -4

QUESTIONj

You just think it wasn't applied

properly here?
HR. HOROWITZi

We think if the Court of

4

Appeals' decision is correct here, there's really no

5

room left at all for the Attorney General to apply any

6

discretion, and that to the extent the opinion suggests

7

that abuse of discretion is the correct standard the

8

court was really only playing lip service to that but in

9

fact was not applying it.

10

In 1974, with the assistance of a professional

11

smuggler, both Respondents entered the United States

12

without inspection.

13

discovered by Immigration officials and was granted the

14

privilege of voluntary departure.

15

as premised and deportation proceedings were instituted

16

against both Respondents.

17

In 1978, Mr. Rios-Pineda was

But he did not depart

Respondents conceded deportability at their

18

deportation hearing and in December 1978 they were

19

ordered deported.

20

for only four and a half years and the suspension of

21

deportation relief requires seven years continuous

22

presence in the United States, Respondents were not

23

eligible for that relief and their request for that

24

relief was denied at the deportation hearing.

25

Because they had been in the country

Respondents took an immediate appeal to the
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Board of Immigration Appeals, raising several wholly

2

unmeritorious contentions.

3

here that both Respondents’ brief to the Board of

4

Immigration Appeals and their later brief to the Eighth

5

Circuit are reprinted in the joint appendix.

6

And I should perhaps note

In accordance with agency regulations, this

7

appeal automatically stayed Respondents’ deportation

8

order.

9

filed a petition for review with the Court of Appeals

When the Board dismissed the appeal, Respondents

10

raising essentially the same contentions.

11

also stayed, automatically stayed their deportation

12

pursuant to statute.

13
14

QUESTION*

Now is that the *82, the one that

resulted in the '82 decision, Nr. Horowitz?

15

HR. HOROWITZ*

16

By March of 1982 —

17

QUESTION*

18

much about that *82 decision.

19

this thing we have to decide?

20

That appeal

That’s right.

I notice your brief doesn’t say

MR. HOROWITZ*

Isn’t that relevant to

Well, I think, the question here

21

is whether the Court of Appeals erred in its later

22

decision in

23

1983.

QUESTION*

Well, I know, but as I read their

24

later opinion what they said is that the law of the case

25

was the *82 decision.

They did order, in effect they

Well, they ordered —

And the Government -- am I right

about that?

'82 decision, did it?

12

MR. HOROWITZ;

No, there was no reason to

13

appeal, because all they had done was given the

14

Respondents the opportunity to file a motion to reopen,

15

which the Board is usually willing to consider, and it

16

asked the Board to consider it.

17

QUESTION;

It didn’t ask it, Mr. Horowitz.

that mandate.

2

excuse me.

3

it was filed in an untimely fashion, an issue that has

4

disappeared from the case.

5

It considered the petition — the motion,

It denied it for several reasons.

It found

It also found that the motion did not make a

6

prima facie case of extreme hardship.

7

is the point where the Court of Appeals in its second

8

opinion disagreed and found that in its view the first

9.

opinion had stated that the Respondents had already made

10

a prima facie case.

11

QUESTION:

And I think this

But the Board in this Court isn't

12

bound by any law of the case doctrine of the Eighth

13

Circuit, is it?

14

HR. HOROWITZ:

No, the Board's not bound by a

15

law of the case doctrine in this Court.

16

think the law of the case really applies at all to the

17

issue that's presented here, even in the Eighth

18

Circuit.

But I don't

QUESTION:

Do I understand what you said, Hr.

20

Horowitz, that the Government has no quarrel at all with

21

the 1982 decision?

22

HR. HOROWITZ:

I think that's fair to say.

23

did not think it was inappropriate that we be asked

to

QUESTION:

should he free to think it was wholly unnecessary for

2

them to do what they did in 1982, but cut of deference

3

to the judicial branch he complied with it rather than

4

appealing.

5

SB. HOROWITZi

Well, in general, when

6

something new comes up and the Court of Appeals just

7

asks the Board to consider it, normally the Board is

8

willing to do that, unless it considers it completely

9

unreasonable.

10

And I would say they did not consider the

1982 decision completely unreasonable.

11

I think,

just to clarify this law of the case

12

question, there are two grounds for the Board’s later

13

denial of the motion to reopen.

hardship has been shown.

hardship.

more in this Court.

18

One was that no extreme

The Court of Appeals disagreed

That’s not really an issue in the case any

But the Board separately -- an independent

19

ground for its decision denying the motion to reopen was

20

that, regardless of whether extreme hardship had been

21

shown, it was going to deny the motion to reopen in its

22

discretion because: A, the Respondents had achieved

23

their threshold eligibility for suspense remedy only by

24

filing frivolous appeals; and B, because they had in

25

other ways showed their disregard for the immigration

they had —

QUESTION:

Did I understand you to say that if

4

the Eighth Circuit ordered the Board to do something, if

5

the Eoard were to do it, it would do it merely out of

6

deference to the Eighth Circuit and not because it was

7

required to comply with any direction of the Eighth

8

Circuit?

ME. HOROWITZ:

did not mean to give that impression.

12

I*m sorry. Justice Brennan, I

QUESTION:

I see.

That’s what I thought you

answered Justice Stevens.

13

SR. HOROWITZ:

The Board had to be complying

14

with the mandate of the Eighth Circuit, and I think any

15

fair reading of the first Eighth Circuit decision —

16

this is discussed in our petition more than actually in

17

our merits brief -- is that the Board did comply with

18

the mandate of the Eighth Circuit.

19

QUESTION:

Well, they have only two choices:

20

either to comply with it or petition for cert.

21

that so?

22

MR. HOROWITZ:

That's right.

Isn’t

But the mandate

23

of the Eighth Circuit was just to allow Respondents to

24

file this motion to reopen and then to consider the

25

motion to reopen.

And as I said at the outset, the

7

He denied it for several reasons that
That’s all the Eighth

To the extent the Eighth Circuit later decided

8

that it had decided the extreme hardship the first time

9

around, it was really reaching well beyond its powers,

10

since extreme hardship is committed to the Attorney

11

General to decide in the first instance.

12

QUESTION:

May I just ask you -- I'm sorry —

13

if the grounds on which it denied the reopening after

14

the Court of Appeals decision relied on anything that

15

was not before the Court of Appeals at the time of its

16

decision?

17

they knew about the smuggling.

18

They knew about the time that had been taken,

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, none of those reasons had

19

been given by the Board before.

20

that served as the basis for the Board’s later denial —

21

that is, the filing of the frivolous appeals and the

22

disregard for the immigration laws — while those had as

23

a chronological matter already happened, there was no

24

reason to think that the Eighth Circuit was thinking

25

about them .

So although the events

(202) 628-9300

1

They had not been given as a reason for any

2

action by the Attorney General, and it was only later

3

that this became an issue.

4

QUESTION;

How much time elapsed because of

5

the filing?

6

frivolous appeals.

7

does it take so long -- why did it take so long to

8

dispose of the appeals?

9

I kind of lost track, the filing of the
Almost three years, wasn't it?

Why

Is that time all chargeable to the Respondents

10

or has the Government got to share some responsibility

11

for that?

12

MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, most of it is chargeable

13

to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

14

about a year from the time this case was argued in the

15

Eighth Circuit to the time the decision came down

16

administrative and judicial system.

I mean, why was one time it was good and the

MR. HOROWITZ;

5

QUESTION;

6
7

The first time —

One time you liked it, the other

time you didn’t.
MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, I wouldn’t go so far as

8

to say we liked it, but we would not consider it a

9

serius threat to the immigration system.

The first

10

appeal to the Court of Appeals simply raised several

11

contentions by Respondents that we think were frivolous

12

as to why their deportation order was incorrect.

13

had ret been able to apply for suspension of deportation

14

earlier because they had not met the seven year

15

requirement.

16

They

The second -- at the first appeal, the Court

17

of Appeals decided that it would give Respondents an

18

opportunity to apply fer this relief, now that the seven

19

years had passed.

20

the Board to consider an application, something that had

21

never been ruled on before.

So it simply sent the case back to

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. HOROWITZ;

On the seven year basis?
Well,

the seven years had been

24

satisfied at that point.

25

for ether reasons, the main reasons the ones that are at

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

issue here, that the eligibility had been achieved only

2

through these dilatory tactics, filing frivolous

3

appeals, and because of the other disregard for the

4

immigration laws.

5

6

QUESTION*

Well now, that’s what I want, the

difference between that and this one.

7

MB. HOROWITZ*

Well, that is the second Eoard

8

decision.

9

of Appeals, and the Court of Appeals on the second time

That decision was then appealed to the Court

10

around, addressing this decision of the Board for the

11

first time, said that it was an abuse of discretion for

12

the Eoard to rely on those two factors, that the fact

13

that these appeals which completely lacked any

14

substantive merit were the only way in which Respondents

15

had become eligible for this relief.

16

That, the Court of Appeals found, was

17

irrelevant and an improper factor to be relied on.

18

Board couldn’t rely on it.

19

The

Second, the fact that Respondents had agreed

20

to depart voluntarily but then not shown up for

21

voluntary departure, the fact that they hired a smuggler

22

to bring them into the country, these were also

23

considered by the Court of Appeals to be improper

24

factors on which the Board could not rely.

25

The Government has serious problems with that
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

decision because in fact it completely eliminates any

2

discretion for the Attorney General in ruling on these

3

things.

4

kinds of factors that the Attorney General ought to be

5

relying on.

6
7

QUESTION;

You mean, the order was different

NR. HOROWITZ;

Well, the order was broader.

The order of the Court of Appeals on the second time --

10
11

These are the

from the first order?

8
9

There just aren’t ether factors.

QUESTION;

You’re not just talking about the

language, are you?

12

HR. HOROWITZ;

Well, the issue before the

13

Court of Appeals was different.

14

didn’t really hold anything the first time around.

15

it did was ask the Board — or order the Beard to afford

16

Respondents an opportunity to seek administrative

17

relief.

18

The Court of Appeals
All

On the second go-around, the Court of Appeals

19

said that the Board had erred and had abused its

20

discretion.

21

QUESTION;

Well,

how can the Court of Appeals

22

vacate a decision of the Immigration and Naturalization

23

Service without holding anything?

24

rate.

25

HR. HOROWITZ;

It's not easy, at any

Well, I wouldn’t necessarily
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

say that they vacated the decision, because the premise

2

of filing a motion to reopen deportation proceedings is

3

that there is an order of deportation outstanding.

4

QUESTION 4

Well, but there was a petition tc

5

review the decision of the INS in the first Court cf

6

Appeals case, and you say the Court of Appeals didn't

7

hold anything but simply directed the INS to consider a

8

petition to reopen.

9

Well, they have to hold that something the INS

10

did was improper, don't they, to come to that

11

conclusion?

12

Otherwise they'd have to affirm it.

MR. HOROWITZs

Well, I don't think, they have

13

to hold that anything the Board had done was improper,

14

and they did not, certainly did not hold that anything

15

the Beard had done was improper.

16

Perhaps what — I'm not sure what you’re

17

driving at, Justice Rehnquist, but it is true that the

18

Court of Appeals, I think, did make a mistake in the

19

first appeal in that they did not really rule on

20

Respondents' appeal, the contentions that they had

21

made.

22

These contentions were that the deportation

23

order was wrong, and the Court of Appeals should have

24

ruled on those because that was really — the

25

Respondents were asking for more relief there than what
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

they get from the Court of Appeals.

2

ruled on those and rejected them.

3

QUESTION;

So they should have

Well, hr. Horowitz, what do you

4

think the Respondent won in the Court of Appeals, in the

5

first go-around in that court?

6

MS. HOROWITZ:.

7

QUESTION;

8

MR. HOROWITZ;

9
10

Did he win the appeal?
He didn’t win the appeal.

Nothing was decided cn the appeal.

He just obtained the

opportunity to go back for further relief.

11
12

All he won --

QUESTION;

Something he did not have without

the Court of Appeals’ judgment, did he?

13

MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, I think we’re really

14

getting to the crux of the case.

15

during the course of the appeal to the Ninth Circuit was

16

that time passed, three and a half years passed.

17

this enabled, because the relief that the Respondent

18

wants ultimately, which is suspension of deportation, is-

19

relief that is not available to him until he’s been in

20

the country for seven years, what he got was managing to

21

stay in this- country until the seven-year period had

22

passed.

23

All that happened

And

At that point it didn’t matter what the Court

24

of Appeals said.

25

this motion to reopen.

He then had the opportunity to file
And that’s exactly the point
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

here, is that by filing appeals that had absolutely no

2

merit he’s just been able to held up the system long

3

enough to achieve eligibility for relief.

4
5

QUESTION;

he got out of it was time, isn’t it?

6
7

Well, the short answer is that what

HR. HOROWITZ;

Absolutely.

He took these

appeals to buy time and he succeeded very well.

8

QUESTION:

Well, does the Board

9

QUESTION;

Explaining it in those terms, the

—

10

Court of Appeals appears to have simply not liked the

11

way the Attorney General exercised his Attorney

12

General.

13

MR. HOROWITZ;

On the second appeal, the court

14

said that the Attorney General was not allowed to rely

15

on the fact that these appeals were taken to buy time.

16

QUESTION;

Well, does the Board have any flat

17

policy as to when the necessary seven-year period stops

18

running?

19

under the statute that at the time the deportation

20

proceedings is brought that’s the end of the seven-year

21

period?

22

simply can’t be counted towards the seven years?

23

I mean, could the Board take the position

Any time after that engaged in litigation

MR. HOROWITZ;

I think the Board could take

24

that position.

25

I think it would not be an abuse of

and they will entertain these motions to reopen.

10

Yes, even though part of the

I'm sorry.

Had you finished ycur

I did have — I wanted to just think through

You rely on the frivolous character of the

11

appeals in your brief, and one of the issues I guess is

12

whether the fact that the two children are American

13

citizens would somehow give them some kind of a legal

14

argument.

15

I gather your position is, even'if the appeals

16

raised very close constitutional, important questions,

17

you'd still have the same discretion?

MR. HOROWITZ;

That would be a closer question.

We’d still have the same

And therefore you could say, well,

21

the time was accumulated by litigation, even though

22

prosecuted in good faith and with substantial questions

raised.

24

MR. HOROWITZ;

Yes.

I would say, getting back

to Justice Rehnquist's point, I think the Board could

say that the time

from the Board's perspective, they

have not done that.

applications.

9

a minimum, the Board is not abusing its discretion

They are willing to consider these

But I think, given that, at a minimum, at

10

unless the appeals have been taken for good reason,

11

unless a case like you posit, where the appeal -- we

12

described this in our reply brief — where it would be

13

reasonable for Respondents to have taken an appeal quite

14

apart from the delay that they were going to gain from

15

it, but rather to take the appeal on their own merits.

16

QUESTION;

Well,

that's true in this case,

17

though, that this issue about the American children had

18

never been decided by this Court, at least.

19

had been decided a couple of times by. lower courts.

20

NR. HOROWITZ;

I guess it

Well, I think it's hard tc — I

21

find it hard to say that that claim w'as not frivolous.

22

It was frivolous.

23

courts, including the Eighth Circuit.

24

argument made in any of the briefs suggesting why the

25

claim had any merit, no case citation, nothing

It had been rejected by several
There was no

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

suggesting why the cases were wrong.
And I think on its face, although it is true
that one district court had once accepted this, the
claim is really guite ridiculous, because it means that
anyone could come into this country and all they have to
do is run and have a baby as soon as they can and then
they can’t be deported, and that's clear.
QUESTION*

Let me ask you about the other half

of ycur abuse of discretion argument, the fact that they
had violated the immigration laws when they came in,
which I guess is the -- that plus the delay are your two
factors.
Isn’t that always true in deportation cases,
and if so, is it a fair factor to use, because doesn’t
it just mean you can use it when you want to and you
don't use it when you don*t want to?
KB. HOROWITZ;

Well, no, that -- you're right

about that, that is not what we relied on, that they
violated the immigration laws when they came in.

That

is true of everyone who applies for suspense, suspension
of deportation.,
QUESTION;

Well, but everyone didn’t come in

by smuggler.
KR. HOROWITZ;
Harshall.

That’s correct, Justice

Not everyone came in through use of a

(202) 628-9300

1

smuggler/ which indicates a greater degree of

2

premeditation and flouting of the Government immigration

3

laws .

4

In other words, I think the Board —

5

QUESTION:

6

You mean that's worse than swimming

across the river?

7

NR. HOROWITZ:

Well, I think the Board is

8

entitled to draw some distinctions between a person who

9

maybe works in a field near the U.S. border and he never

10

sees any Border Patrol agents or anything and figures,

11

well, the United States must not really care whether I

12

go.

13
14
15
16
17

QUESTION:

But there's surely premeditation in

both cases.
NR. HOROWITZ:

Well, no; he may just walk

across because he sees no one stopping him.
I think the more important factor here,

18

though, other than the use of a smuggler, is that the

19

Respondent here deceived the Immigration Service even

20

after he had been apprehended.

21

administrative voluntary departure.

22

He asked for extensions of time because his wife is

23

pregnant, and then when they finally told him there was

24

going to be no further extensions he just didn't show up

25

for voluntary departure.

They offered him
He accepted that.

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

And in fact the record I think strongly

2

suggests that he never had any intention of voluntarily

3

departing.

4

where the judge asked him whether he wanted to apply fcr

5

voluntary departure, a prerequisite to applying is

6

stating at the hearing that you will in fact depart if

7

you’re granted voluntary departure.

8

the transcript of the hearing you’ll see that it took

9

several minutes for the Immigration Judge to coax this

In fact, at the Immigration Judge’s hearing

And if you lock at

10

statement out of him, because he said several times that

11

he was not going to leave no matter what.

12

And once someone is caught by the immigration

13

system, I think the Attorney General is entitled to take

14

into account whether that person is going to comply,

15

sort of play by the rules of the game at that point.

16

mean, here is someone who has really taken, every step

17

of the way has taken whatever steps he can, even if it

18

includes deceiving the immigration authorities, to

19

escape deportation.

20

QUESTION*

Well, what again would be the basis

21

for the Attorney General’s suspending deportation in

22

this case?

23

hardship?

24
25

I

What does the regulation say?

SR. HOROWITZ:

Is it

Well, the statute says that the

alien has to meet three threshold criteria:

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

2

and he has to show extreme hardship.

3

those three criteria, at that point the Attorney General

4

then has discretion to decide whether he should stay or

5

no t.

Cnee he meets

Some of the thing she would take into account

7

I think are the degree of the hardship, even if it meets

8

the extreme hardship.

11
12
13

QUESTION;

And this is just totally a matter

of discretion, is it not, with the Attorney General?
MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, the Court has described

it as unfettered discretion .
QUESTION;

Well then, why does the Court of

14

Appeals have the right to review it at all?

15

say it’s an abuse of discretion standard when there are

16

no standards for the exercise of the discretion in the

17

first place?

18

UR. HOROWITZ:

Why do you

Well, the statute gives the

19

alien an opportunity to appeal to the Court of Appeals.

20

I think it’s a loose, very deferential standard of

21

review, but there are -- for example, if the Eoard were

22

to rely on some factor that clearly could not have been

23

within the contemplation of Congress in setting up the

24

remedy, I think the court might be justified in finding

25

an abuse of discretion, if they said, we*re going to

Well, hasn't this Court spoken of

unfettered discretion?
MR. HOROWITZ;

The Court spoke of unfettered

24

discretion actually in connection with the suspension

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

very broad discretion, but not necessarily unreviewable

subject to review.

Well, but review under what

I mean, I wonder whether the Government isn't

Well,

Now, the Court of Appeals said abuse of

.Where does the Court of Appeals derive

MS. HOROWITZi

Well, the Court said unfettered

17

discretion in the case of Jay versus Foyd, but the Court

18

went on in that case to decide whether the Attorney

19

General had in fact abused his discretion there.

20

think it was sort of implicit in the Court's decision

21

that there is some — there could be conceivable

22

circumstances under which it would be legitimate to find

23

abuse of discretion.

24
25

QUESTION*

So I

I think there are not many.
Are you saying that even if the

standard is unfettered discretion, there'can be an abuse

MR. HOROWITZ;

Yes, purely on the basis of

race, or even if it was made for some completely

arbitrary reason that was placed on the record, and it

could be not concaivable that Congress contemplated that

As to the disregard of the immigration laws,

they said disregard of the immigration laws might well

QUESTION:

The

Well, did the Board say that it was

considering simply the fact that they were deportable cr

the fact that they had been smuggled in illegally?

MR. RUDNICKs

They said that they considered

And the Court of Appeals said that

MR. RUDNICK;

No, what the Court of Appeals

are a peculiar problem under the immigration laws.

When you're dealing with unfettered

discretion, why should the Board have to explain

anything to the Court of Appeals?
MR. RUDNICK;

The

HR- RUDNICKj

assert a suspension of deportation claim.

15

QUESTION;

So there is

Well, but it's not so much a

16

jurisdictional question I was asking about, but your

17

suggestion, based on the Court of Appeals’

18

realize, that the Board not only must state reasons why

it chooses not to reopen the case, but has to explain to

20

the satisfaction of the Court of Appeals why these

reasons make the case different from some other case.

23

HR. RUDNICK:

I don’t think that the Court

saying there's a range of decisions that we might

2

disagree with, that we have to uphold, we must affirm,

3

because you are the primary enforcer of the immigration

laws; but we as a Court of Appeals have a duty to make

5

you make those decisions in a rational way.

6

You have to explain why you treat A

differently from B, and that has been the thrust of the

post-Wang Court of Appeals decisions.

INS, which is a Fifth Circuit case cited in both briefs

12

QUESTION*

But there's a presumption of

regularity in any administrative proceeding, and surely

14

the burden is on the party that wants to upset the

15

decision to show that these people have been treated

16

differently from somebody else.

17

But the Court of Appeals didn't indicate, we

18

see other cases where you have treated people

different.

to me that just reverses the ordinary presumption.

I thought the Court of Appeals was expressing kind of an

people stay about whom these same things could be said.

It seems to me,

The present regulation doesn’t say that.

It’s

13

framed in the negative.

because it’s framed in the negative that gives the

Attorney General broad discretion, but not unfettered

17

QUESTIONS

And this Court in Wang says

Well, in Wang it said broad

18

discretion.

Jay against Boyd said unfettered

19

discretion.

You seek to draw from Wang the inference

20

that, because the term ’’broad discretion’’ was used, the

21

term "unfettered discretion" has been disapproved, and

22

that really stretches things.

Jay is inconsistent in its

usage.

QUESTION:

Did Congress say "sound

MR. RUDNICK;

In the Section 244 in the Act

itself, it says "in the discretion of the Attorney

It doesn't say "sound."
QUESTION:

They didn’t modify it with any

adjectives, then?

10

MR. RUDNICK:

11

As to the question from Mr. Justice Stevens as

at the feet of the Immigration Service and not at the

feet of the alien.

That was all?

MR. RUDNICKi

I think they felt that, when

2

they considered it the second time, that the first time

3

they had ordered the Board to reopen and that the Board

4

wasn’t free to deny the motion.

QUESTION*

Well, are you arguing that the

6

second gave them nothing that the first hadn't already

given?

MR. RUDNICK:

Oh, no.

I think the — our

position is not that the first — we don’t adopt the law

10

of the case argument.

11

fairness to the Government,

12

opinion is unequivocal.

13

ambiguous.

14

I just cannot read the — in

The court felt that it

It’s arguable, but it’s not — it wasn’t well

Now, the Attorney General clearly continues to

have the discretion to — I use the word — sanction, to

23

gained.

24

do that.

25

The Court of Appeals didn’t say they couldn't

What the Court of Appeals said is;
38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

You said

1

it was frivolous; we've taken a look at it and most of

2

what, the conduct that was alleged to be frivolous, took

3

place in front of us, and we have looked at it and we

4

have determined that it's not frivolous.

5

They're not saying that the Attorney General

6

can't utilize that authority.

7

in this particular case, as applied to the facts of this

8

case and as applied to the law of this case, that it's

9

not frivolous.

10

QUESTION:

They're just saying that

By what standard should we review

11

the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the conduct before

12

them and by them wasn't frivolous?

13

MR. RUDNICK:

I think some deference is due

14

the decision of the Court of Appeals, since the activity

15

talked ab&ut took place in front of them.

I wouldn't

16

say it's an abuse of discretion standard.

I think that

17

would be an overbroad argument.

18

I think some deference is due, since it did

19

take place in front of them.

Not as much deference as

20

due to the Attorney General by the Court of Appeals.

21

As to the — I want to stress again on the

22

issue of disregard, the Court of Appeals didn't say the

23

Board couldn't apply that rule, but that, as we've gone

24

into, that they only had to apply it in a manner that

25

made sense, that was rational, that wasn't arbitrary and
39

capricious.

I have nothing else, unless there are other
questions.

4

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question about Jay

5

against Boyd, which I hadn’t read before the argument

6

and I’ve just read it, and the scope of the discretion

7

in the case.

8

case, which is quite interesting, is to the probation

9

proceedings, which in 1955 were proceedings in which

10

there was total discretion by the authority that had

11

discretion to grant or revoke probation or parole.

12

The analogy that the Court made in that

Has anybody ever argued that, just as the law

13

of parole has changed, that maybe the rules here also

14

require the same kind of procedures?

15

MR. RUDNICK;

I think that’s what we’re

16

arguing, is there’s been an evolution in the practice cf

17

administrative law and there has been an evolution in

18

this Court’s decisions.

19

QUESTION;

If you make that argument,

20

you’re basically -- it’s basically a procedural

21

argument.

22

MR. RUDNICK:

23

QUESTION;

then

Yes, i think essentially --

And then what’s wrong with the

24

procedure that the Attorney General did follow?

25

maybe you don’t like his reasons, but he did tell us

Because

what they were

2

can't say it’s totally arbitrary to say somebody who

3

gets extra time by litigating to get it is —

4

And maybe they’re pretty weak, but you

HR. RUDNICK:

We’re not arguing that that

5

class of behavior can’t be sanctioned.

6

that the Attorney General can’t deny motions to reopen

7

where frivolous appeals have gained the seven years.

8

All the Court of Appeals held here, and that’s what the

9

Court of Appeals said — all the Court of Appeals said

10

We’re not saying

is this appeal, these appeals weren’t frivolous.

11

QUESTION:

But why can’t he say that the time

12

that’s gained by appeals that we think are frivolous are

13

enough?

14

frivolity, frivolousness, whatever the right word is?

Why can’t they define their own standard of

MR. RUDNICK:

I think in terms of expertise,

16

this isn’t something that the agency was set up to

17

decide.

18

appeals.

19

think less deference is due a decider, an administrative

20

agency, when they decide something that's not within

21

their expertise than something that’s within.

22

They’re no set up to decide what are frivolous
That’s more of a judgment that courts make.

I

When the Board makes a decision as to what

23

category of conduct raises peculiar problems under the

24

immigration laws, that’s where deference should be

high.

That’s what they’re set up to do.

They’re set up

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN IRA HOROWITZ, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10

MR. HOROWITZ:

A couple points.

I think

11

there's a little bit of confusion here about exactly

12

what's been held.

13

Board did not dispute in its remand, that the seven year

14

standard has been satisfied.

15

whose fault the delay is, because this is not like a

16

speedy trial case, where parts of the delay are being

17

excluded.

18

The Government does not dispute, the

It doesn't really matter

We agree that they met the seven year

19

standard.

20

standard was met only because they took these frivolous

21

appeals, thereby bringing these automatic stay

22

provisions into effect, the Board in its discretion was

23

not going to exercise its discretion favorably towards

24

the Respondents to reopen the deportation proceedings

25

that had already been closed.

What the Board held was that, because the

3

4

determination was in error at all.

5

is clear that they should have been deported in December

6

of 1978.

7

Nothing that has

With hindsight, it

The Respondents have already gotten — even at

8

the time that the Board ruled,

9

a half years of an additional windfall of being in this

they had gotten three and

country, gust because they filed these appeals and

11

invoked the stay.

12

What the Board has said that, in addition to

13

that windfall, we’re not also going to let you achieve

14

eligibility for relief that would let you stay in this

15

country permanently just because you filed these

16

appeals.

tremendous incentive for everybody to file whatever kind

18

of papers they can to delay things until they meet the

19

statutory requirements.

20

If they do that, it's going to create a

If the Board takes the position that it did

21

take here, then at least a person knows that by taking

22

these sorts of dilatory tactics he's not going to put

himself in a position to create new equities that is

And the Board in fact -- I'm sorry.

it should have ruled on them, because what they were
