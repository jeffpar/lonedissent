CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments

Nr. Shrago.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALVIN H.

SHRAGO,

ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHRAGO:

Nr. Chief Justice, and may it

8

please the Court, at issue in this case is whether an

9

Indian tribe may unilaterally, without any approval

10

11

whatsoever from the Secretary of the Interior, impose
taxes on non-Indian oil and gas lessees.

12

This issue arises in this case in the context

13

of the Navajo Tribe of Indians, which has never adopted

14

any constitution at all, and which in fact has twice

15

rejected invitations by the Congress to adopt

16

constiututions, first in Section 16 of the Indian

17

Reorganization Act of 1934, and second in Section 6 of

18

the Navajo Hopi Rehabilitation Act of 1950.

19

In June of 1982, the United States District

20

Court for the District of Arizona held that the taxes,

21

business activity tax and the possessory interest tax

22

were invalid because they lacked Secretarial approval.

23

That decision was reversed by the Ninth

24

Circuit Court of Appeals in April of 1984,

25

that Secretarial approval was not required.

The Federal District Judge in New Mexico

dismissed petitioner's claims against the tribe and the

3

Tax Commission themselves on the grounds of sovereign

immunity, but the remaining claims proceeded against

tribal officials on the doctrine of ex parte Young on

the allegations that tribal officials were purporting to

In March of 1980, the District Judge in New

the Ninth Circuit incorporated by reference the

2

reasoning and the result in the Tenth Circuit's

decisi on.

4

It is our position that this holding is

5

fundamentally inconsistent and fundamentally

6

misconstrues the very basic nature of the relationship

between the United States and the Indian tribes.

is a holding which effectuates a radical change in some

QUESTION:

Nr. Shrago, do you think the

12

Merrion decision recognized only a limited sovereign

13

power to tax conditioned on the requirement of the

14

Secretary's approval?

15

MB. SHRAGO:

I think, Justice O'Connor, that

16

the Merrion decision recognized that Indian tribes

17

generally have an inherent power to tax.

18

think the decision in Merrion also recognized that the

19

Congress has regulated the manner and extent to which

20

Indian tribes may exercise that power, and that is

21

precisely --

However, I

1

MR. SHRAGC;

Because as this Court held in

2

Merrion, the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 set forth

3

a procedure whereby tribes should adopt constitutions

4

and then if they wish to tax non-Indians, announce their

5

intention to tax non-Indians and have their taxing

6

ordinances approved by the Secretary of the Interior.

7

The Court was explicit in explaining that this

8

was, and I quote, "the administrative process

9

established by Congress to monitor such exercises of

10

tribal authority."

The Congress has regulated the manner and

No, Your Honor, this was in

drafted and circulated to the Secretary for his review,

the constitution that was being proposed for the Havajos

to adopt under Section 6 of the Navaho Hopi

Yes, he did observe that there

5

It is that machinery, the adoption of a

constitution and approval by the Secretary of the

7

Interior which is precisely what the Indian

8

Reorganization Act was designed to accomplish.

9

That is precisely, as this Court recognized in

10

Merrion, the administrative process established by

11

Congress to monitor such exercises of tribal authority.

7

HR. SHRAGO;

I believe that question has been

answered in Merrion, and we are not -QUESTION;

And the Court said, yes, it

includes that.
MR. SHRAGO;

That's correct, but the Court

8

also went further and said that before the power to tax

9

could be exercised, it had to be approved by the

10

Secretary of the Interior, and in fact Justice Marshall

11

in the opinion in Merrion explicitly made the

12

distinction between the existence of 3 sovereign power

13

to tax, which he explained, that neither the tribe’s

14

constitution, in that case the Jicarilla Apache Tribe,

15

nor the Federal Constitution is the font of any tribal

16

sovereign power to tax.

17

But he also explained, however, that in light

18

of the Indian Reorganization Act, amendment of the

19

tribe's constitution to authorize the tax, to announce

20

the intention to tax, was the necessary event or the

21

critical event, as I believe he put it, necessary to

22

effectuate the tax, and the word "effectuate” was

23

highlighted .

24
25

In short, again we are talking about existence
of a power and the manner and extent by which the
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Congress has regulated that power.

2

it is essential that there be this administrative

3

process for review of the tribal taxing power.

4

At the present time#

As the Court mentioned in Merrion, Secretarial

5

approval is a necessary constraint to minimize the

6

potential concern that tribes may exercise the power to

7

tax in an unfair or unprincipled manner, or in any way

8

inconsistent with overriding national interests.

9

Under this Court's interpretation of Santa

10

Clara Pueblo versus Martinez, we cannot challenge the

11

unfairness of this tax under the due process or equal

12

protection clauses of the Indian Civil Bights Act of

13

1968, nor can we challenge the due process and equal

14

protection problems we have with these taxes under the

15

Federal Constitution, since it has been held that those

16

limitations do not apply to Indian tribes.

17

In short, the only relief that we have is if

18

this administrative process established by Congress to

19

monitor such exercises of tribal authority is upheld and

20

respected by the Secretary.

21

what the Secretary did in connection with the Hopi

22

Indian Tribe, which of course resides on the land

23

situated within the exterior boundaries of the Navajo

Tribe.

constitutions to repudiate their constitutions so that

they may exercise these powers without federal
supervision and federal control.
This would be the remarkable conclusion that

7

the objectives of an Act of Congress can best be

8

furthered by ignoring and repudiating the Act

9

altogether.

10

It simply makes no sense.

The need for Secretarial approval , of course,

11

is unquestioned.

12

itself, Secretarial approval is one of those constraints

13

that minimizes potential concern that the tribal taxing

14

power may be exercised in an unfair or unprincipled

15

manner, or that

16

inconsistent with overriding national interests.

17

As the Court observed in Kerrion

enacted by the Hopi Tribe on the grounds that it
violated the due process clause of the Indian Civil
Eights Act of 1968,

we see no reason,

no basis, no

principle either in logic or in fact by which the

5

Secretary could claim that the identical tax which

6

offends the identical due process clause of the Indian

7

Civil Fights Act of 1968 should somehow be permitted to

8

be implemented merely because the other tribe has net

9
10
11
12

adopted a constitution under the IRA or under similar
legislation, and in fact has not adopted a constitution
at al 1.
To the contrary, we believe that the need for

13

Secretarial review, federal oversight of tribal

14

exercises of the taxing power is all the more pressing

15

in the case of those tribes which have refused to adopt

16

constitutions than it is in the case of those tribes

17

which have at least followed the Congressional policy

18

and adopted constitutions.

19

After all, the constitutional form of

20

government in this nation is basic, principal, and

21

fundam ental.

22

In New Mexico versus Mescalero Apache Tribe,

23

unanimous decision of this Court involving hunting and

24

fishing rights and regulation of those rights by the

25

state cr by the tribe, this Court observed that federal

a

1

law commits to the Secretary and to the tribe the

2

responsibility to manage the reservation’s resources.

3
4

The Court also unanimously held

that federal

law requires the Secretary to approve the tribe's

5

hunting and fishing ordinances, which of course the

6

Secretary had done in that case.

7

This, of course, was also a matter on which

8

the Court had remarked in United States versus Wheeler,

9

a case involving the Navajo tribe itself.

In Wheeler,

10

the Court distinguished between the existence of an

11

inherent power, and that was the basis on which there

12

was a dispute between.the majority and the minority in

13

Kerrion, whether as a matter of inherent tribal power,

14

the power existing, not on whether the manner and extent

15

of that power had been regulated by the Congress.

16

The Court in Wheeler, a case involving the

17

Navajo Tribe, explained that Congress has in certain

18

ways regulated the manner and extent of the tribal power

19

of self-government does not mean that Congress is the

20

source of that power.

21

We have the difference between existence of

22

the power and the manner in which that power can be

23

exercised.

24

exercise the power to tax against non-Indians, at the

25

very least that tax must be approved by the Secretary

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH BERNSTEIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

MS. FERNSTEIN;

Thank you, Hr. Chief Justice,

2

and may it please the Court, the Navajo Tribal Council

3

enacted the broad-based tax lavs at issue in this case

4

because it is badly in need of funds to provide

5

essential governmental services, including police, fire

6

protection, roads, health care, clean drinking water, to

7

a reservation of over 25,000 square miles.

8
9

These laws, like other tribal laws, were
submitted in due course to the Department of the

10

Interior, and it was the decision not of the tribe but

11

of the Department of the Interior that there was nothing

12

in federal law, federal regulations, or tribal law which

13

conditioned the effectiveness of those tribal taxes on

14

Secretarial approval.

15

The Secretary has therefore repeatedly and in

16

writing declined to act to either approve or disapprove

17

the laws as he asserts that it would be a gratuitous act

18

of no effect.

19

Two and a half years after the possessory

20

interest tax was enacted by the Navajo Tribal Council,

21

Kerr-McGee amended its complaint to allege that the

22

validity of the taxes depended on Secretarial action.

23

It is important to realize the scope of

24

Kerr-ffcGee's allegation.

25

case but that Congress, for example, has power to

There is no question in this

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

control, divest, limit tribal taxation.

2
3
4

But Kerr-McGee is allegi-ng not just that
Congress has delegated to the Secretary, for example,
the power to regulate tribal taxation, not just that the

5

Secretary in the absence of regulation even could veto a

6

tribal ordinance, but rather, that in the absence of

7

affirmative federal action which the Secretary has

8

declined to take and determined to be unnecessary, a

9

tribe’s exercise of its own inherent sovereign powers,

10

powers which this Court has recognized to derive not

11

from the federal government but from the tribe’s

12

sovereignty, that the tribe may not exercise those

13

powers, that the exercise remains ineffective, that the

14

Secretary cannot even waive, either deliberately or

15

through lapse of time, such a requirement.

16

One of the ironies of this case is that that

17

was not even the case under the Jicarilla Apache

18

constitution, which, although it does subject certain

19

taxing laws to Secretarial approval, also provides that

20

if the Secretary fails to disapprove a law submitted

21

within

22

120 days, the law will become effective.
Other tribal constitutions under the Indian

23

Reorganization Act specifically allow the Secretary in

24

his sole discretion in writing to waive an approval

25

requirement.

The need for that kind of certainty and
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that kind of closure is a great in tribal government as

2

it is anywhere else.

3

tribal government into chaos.

4

Kerr-bcGee's argument would throw

It leads to the conclusion that there may be

5

scores of tribal laws which have been on the books for

6

decades now which everyone has believed to be effective

7

but which according to Kerr-tfcGee would be ineffective

8

because there was an approval requirement that was so

9

subtle and so implicit that the Secretary didn’t knew

10

that it existed, and that the Secretary's own

11

determination that there was no such requirement has

12

never sufficed to give effect to those laws.

13

Over 100 years ago the Senate Judiciary

14

Committee upheld the validity of Chickasaw revenue

15

ordinances which fell on non-Indians and which had bean

16
17

approved by no agent of the federal government.
In the Attorney General opinion cited in the

18

United States' brief in 18 Opinions of the Attorney

19

General, it was -- that earlier Senate Judiciary

20

Committee determination was not only reaffirmed, but the

21

Attorney General went cn to answer specifically the

22

question, not only were these laws valid, but were they

23

subject to revision or control by any department or

24

officer of the United States, and concluded that they

25

were not because Congress had not delegated that power
26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

to any agent or officer of the United States.

2
3
4

The argument about tribes having been tricked
into reorganizing under the Indian Reorganization Act
rests on a fundamentally incorrect assumption, which is

5

that if the tribe organized under the Iniian

6

Reorganization Act, it was required to condition its

7

laws in that constitution on Secretarial approval.

8
9

That has never been the case.

It has never

been the Secretary's interpretation of the law, nor did

10

Congress say anything of the sort in the Indian

11

Reorganization Act.

12

In fact, while the Act referred to Secretarial

13

approval with respect to certain additional powers which

14

were enumerated in the Indian Reorganization Act, with

15

respect to the vesting of existing tribal powers in the

16
17

tribes pursuant to their constitutions, there was nc
mention by Congress whatsoever of Secretarial approval.

18

QUESTION;

What is the explanation or the

19

speculation as to why the tribes, some tribes or perhaps

20

all of them who adopted constitutions put in this

21

requirement of Secretarial approval?

22

MS. BERNSTEIN;

Well, first of all, Your

Does the tribe give notice that

MS. EEFNSTEIN;

The Secretary’s regulations

First of all, it is not the case that these

to pay it, to pay the tax, I suppose the tribe would

There is no cancellation of

It may also be the case that if it came down

to the tribe seizing and selling property, if the tribe

seizes and sells someone's pickup truck, it does not

need Secretarial approval.

16

If the tribe wants to seize and sell a

leasehold, at that point there may be a Secretarial

approval requirement if the regulations so provide, but

19

that -- the enforcement mechanisms are not at issue at

20

this point because the tribe has not attempted to

enforce them against anybody.

And those questions as to what are the federal

limitations on any specific enforcement mechanism can

only be answered when and if the tribe needs to use

those enforcement mechanisms.

QUESTION;

Your opponent contends that they

2

have no real way of challenging those things because of

3

the Santa Clara case.

4

MS. BERN STEINi

Well, of course, they are,

5

first of all, ignoring tribal forums entirely, which was

6

exactly the remedy that was suggested in the Santa Clara

7

case, and I think it is significant that it is in the

8

Indian Civil Rights Act, not in the Mineral leasing Act

9

or in any other law by which the Secretary is suppose!

10

to protect tribal property, it is in the Indian Civil

Rights Act that Congress has specifically directed

itself to what protection should persons, non-Indians or

13

Indian, within tribal jurisdiction have from the Indian

14

tribes.

They keep referring,

for example, to the fact

that the Hopi ordinances were held to violate due

4

The due process violation was not a procedural

one but arose from the fact that the Hopi

tribe was

asserting taxing jurisdiction beyond its territorial

That is the kind of issue which would readily

be heard in the federal courts to determine what the

Accordingly, the IRA is simply not a proper
source for insisting that Congress imposed Secretarial
approval as a precondition to the validity of any taxing
ordinance effecting non-Indians.
Under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1938, similar
problems arise.

That Act, to be sure, does give the

Secretary pervasive regulation of leasing,

the

management of Indian property, and area traditionally
governed, controlled, supervised pervasively by the
government, but that Act has nothing whatever to do with

11

the exercise not of the landlord’s right but of the

governmental prerogatives of an Indian tribe, including

13

the power of taxation.

14
15

16
17

QUESTION;

Mr. Claiborne, in your view, what

is the source of the Secretary's authority to approve
any tribal tax?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

Justice O'Connor, in the

18

particular case of provisions in IRA constitutions, it

19

seems to me that the source is the IRA itself insofar as

20

Congress said the constitution adopted pursuant to this

21

Act shall be valid only when approved by the Secretary,

22

and impliedly Congress presumably permitted the

23

Secretary or the tribe or the two together to include

24

within such constitutions further approval requirements

25

with respect to certain kinds of legislation.
41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

QUESTION:

Is it presently the Secretary’s

2

view that tribes with a written constitution under the

3

IRA can amend their constitution and the Secretary will

4
5

approve it if the amendment is to withdraw Secretarial
approval to impose taxes?

6

MR. CLAIBORNE;

Exactly so. Justice O'Connor,

7

and as counsel for petitioners correctly stated, our

8

brief recites that it has been the policy of the

9

Department of Interior for some years now not merely to

10

approve amendments to constitutions to remove what as a

11

matter of federal law are unnecessary Secretarial review

12

provisions, but to encourage amendment of tribal

13

constitutions to that end, and a substantial number of

14

tribal constitutions have recently been amended with

15

that in mind.

16

Why don't we turn to the alternative argument

17

that seems to be made in part by the petitioners?

18

.is that from time immemorial, at least since the tribes

19

became subject to the jurisdiction of

20

their power of taxation has been somehow subjected to

federal approval.

That

the United States,

22

That is tantamount to saying that the power of

23

taxation did not survive, and it amounts to nothing more

24

than the privilege of asking the Secretary, if you

25

agree,

may we tax,

and only if he says yes may they do

2

survived dependent status in the sense in which this

3

Court indicated that power both in the Coville and in

5

So that is hardly a sovereign inherent power that

the Merrion cases.
It is, moreover, completely at odds with the

6

historic distinction between the supervision of the

7

United States over the property management function and

8

the attributes of Indian sovereignty.

9

In order to protect tribal land, in order to

10

protect the Indians frcm being taken advantage of by

11

outsiders, by their neighbors, by those who were selling

12

them goods, the government has traditionally since the

13

first Nonintercourse Act in 1790 and in a series of

14

treaties and legislation ever since quite pervasively

15

regulated property transactions so as to protect the

16
17

Indians from being taken advantage of.
There is nothing, nothing at all comparable on

18

the side of the exercise of Indian sovereign

19

prerogatives, including the taxing power.

20

QUESTIONS

Does the Secretary think there are

21

any other overriding provisions of federal law,

22

constitutional or otherwise, that might impact on the

23

exercise by the tribe of its taxing powers?

24

MR. CLAIBORNE:

QUESTION:

Justice O’Connor --

MR. CLAIBORNE*

This Court in the Herrion case

was so mewhat undecided as to whether the commerce clause
in a f ull-fledged way limited the exercise of taxing

5

power by Indian tribes.

6

that i t would, or that the Indian commerce clause, its

For present purposes we accept

It is charged that we have on the one hand

15

said that it is a good idea to subject tribal taxation

16

to federal approval and today take a difference stance.

17

There is a consistent strand, which is this.

18

The Department of Interior has at all times

19

taken the view, correctly, that federal law, Congress

20

has not required it to approve or disapprove any

21

ordinance, but has permitted it to insist through the

22

IRA and the writing of tribal constitutions that for a

23

time in specific circumstances it was a wise idea, not

24

mandated by Congress, but permitted by Congress to the

25

Secretary, to supervise the exercise of tribal taxation,

2

Reorganization Act succeeded to an extent where it is

that supervision is no longer necessary, and accordingly

it is now the policy of the department to remove that
