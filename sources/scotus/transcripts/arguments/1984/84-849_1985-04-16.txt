ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE M. GEOGHEGAN, JR., ESC.,
ON EEEAIF CF THE PETITIONER
NR. GEOGHEGAN:

Thank you.

Nr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

11

Court, this case is here on Kentucky's petition for writ

12

of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals fcr

13

the Sixth Circuit.

14

The State of Kentucky submits that the United

15

States Ccurt cf Appeals for the Sixth Circuit erred when

16

it affirmed the award of the attorneys' fees which was

17

rendered to the United States District Court for the

18

Western District of Kentucky.

19

After briefly summarizing the facts of this

20

case, I intend to explain tc this Court precisely why

21

the court belcw erred in its construction of Hutto v.

22

Finney, and why in any event 42 United States Code

23

Section 1988 provided no authority fcr the award cf

24

attorneys' fees in this particular case.

Of course, Your Honors, this particular case

QUESTION*

2
3
4

You are referring to the District

Court?
HE. GEOGHEGAN;

Yes, Your Honor.

The District

5

Court dismissed the State of Kentucky as a party

6

defendant based upon the Eleventh Amendment and upcn

7

citing Hutto v. Finney and in its order, which may be

8

found at Page 14A cf the petition for writ of

9

certiorari, it indicates that the court felt that it

was

10

improper to award attorneys’ fees against the State of

11

Kentucky in

12

merits was retrospective in nature.

13

this case when the relief sought on the

New, some nine months after the court

14

dismissed Kentucky as a party defendant, they entered

15

the remaining parties entered into settlement

16

negotiations.

17

provided -- and incidentally, the settlement was ordered

18

filed in camera by the District Court.

19

The case was settled.

The settlement provided $45,000 to the

20

plaintiffs frem Kenneth Brandenburgh personally and ir

(202) 628-9300

Now, simultaneously with the settlement in

1
2

this case,

the District Cent entered an agreed order

3

dismissing the parties in the case, and this order may

4

be found at Page 15A of the appendix, petition for writ

5

of certiorari, and the order indicated no fault was

6

found cn the part of any of the parties.

7

But Paragraph 15 of this order entertained ar

8

award of attorneys' fees against the State of Kentucky.

9

New, the State cf Kentucky had not had any idea that

10

there was going to be a request, or that anyone was

11

going to look to it for attorneys' fees from the date cf

12

dismissal until the date cf this order, which was alert

13

nine months later,

14
15

I believe.

QUESTION;

In this case I guess only damages

were sought.

16

ME. GEOGHEGAN;

17

QUESTION;

Your Honor, that is correct.

Would your position be any

18

different,

19

fees had injunctive relief been requested in the

20

original action?

21

and could the state be liable for attorneys*

ME. GEOGHEGAN*

Your Honor, had injunctive

22

relief been requested in this action, it would seem tc

23

me to be in the same type situation as Hutto v. Finney,

24

and in that case if prospective relief were awarded

25

against a state officer acting in his official capacity,
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

it would be permissible to award attorneys' fees

2

ancillary to that.
QUESTION:

3
4

Assuming it -If it were awarded, if injunctive

relief were in fact granted.
MB. GEQGHEGAN:

5

If injunctive relief were i r.

6

fact awarded against a state officer in his official

7

capaci ty.

8
9

Now, after the court entered this order -- I
think we indicated on Page 10 of our brief that we

10

didn't have notice about the request for attorneys' fees

11

until September 2nd.

12

That is not correct.

Me did knew about it as of July the 1st,

1982,

13

because that is when the court entered the agreed order,

14

and thereafter we responded some 13 days later to a

15

motion for attorneys' fees from the plaintiffs.

16

We responded to that motion.

The court then

17

on September the 2nd entered an order awarding,

18

did this without a hearing, the court ordered and

19

directed that attorneys’ fees be awarded against the

20

State of Kentucky, but set a hearing tc determine the

21

amount of the fees later on.

22

and be

New, at this point the State cf Kentucky filed

23

two separate motions to vacate the order.

One was filed

24

by Justice, ere by the Attorney General of Kentucky.

25

And as a part of that motion to vacate that the Attorney

(202) 628-9300

1

General filed, he attached excerpts of a report

2

conducted as the result of an extensive investigation cf

3

the search incident in question.

4

And those excerpts, which can be found at

5

Pages 26A and 28A of the petition, the appendix to the

6

petition for writ of certiorari, indicated that the

7

officers at the scene of the search acted in an

8

unprofessional manner and used excessive force.

9

The court, after holding a hearing to

10

ascertain the amount of the fees, awarded costs to the

11

plaintiff in the approximate amount cf £64,000,

12

including an attorney's fee cf some $58,000.

13

The court appealed this case to the United

14

States Court

15

court affirmed in a concurring opinion.

16

cf Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and that

The first point we raise before this Court

17

today is the language of 4? United States Cede Section

18

1988 itself provides no authority for attorney's fees.

19

20

QUESTION;

Before you get into your argument,

may I ask gust one factual question --

21

BE. GEOGHEGAN;

22

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

— about the order to dismiss the

23

state as a party back in November.

It ends up saying

24

"This is not a. final and appealable order."

25

mean that the parties contemplated that something might

(202) 628-9300

Does that

1

be revised with -- what -- does that have any

2

significance at all?

3
4

MR. GEOGHEGANi

As far as I can see, Your

Honor, that has no significance in the case.

5

QUESTIONi

Okay.

6

MR. GEOGHEGAN;

Mow, under the American rule,

7

a prevailing party is not ordinarily entitled to a fee,

8

the prevailing party is not, from the losing party under

9

ordinary circumstances.

10

This Court has recognized two exceptions to

11

the rule, the bad faith exception, which is not the

12

situation here; the ether exception is when Congress

13

adopts the statute which dees authorize the court to

14

award attorneys' fees to a prevailing party.

15

This is the situation we have in this

16

particular case.

17

Congress provided the authority for a court to award

18

attorneys' fees to a prevailing party, a party whe

19

prevails under, in this particular situation, it would

20

be under 1983.

21

In U2 United States Cede Section 1986

Now, the question before this Court on this

22

issue is very narrow, and it is just this, whether the

23

plaintiffs in this case were the prevailing parties as

24

to the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

25

Now, we have a complaint that was filed in
9

(202) 628-9300

this case.

declaratory relief.

3

court indicated that no fault was found on behalf cf ary

4

of the parties.

5

would indicate that the police on that incident

6

following the hcmocide were following any policies cf

7

the State of Kentucky or custom of the State of

8

Kentucky.

13

importantly in this case, the District Court dismissed

14

the State of Kentucky as a party defendant by virtue cf

15

the Eleventh

16

That indicates that the police were violating

Amendment.

QUESTION:

Kentucky --

Ccunsel, if this lawsuit had been

17

on the state side in the commonwealth courts, would the

18

commonwealth be a proper party defendant?

19

KR. GEOGHEGANi

Y cur Honor, we would contend

20

had that occurred that under 1983 Kentucky wculd net

21

a proper party defendant, and secondly, there is nc

22

proof to indicate that the State cf Kentucky was

23

responsible fer the policies that were followed by the

24

police on this particular occasion.

25

QUESTICK;

he

Cf course, the second stated reason
10

(202) 628-9300

1

doesn't go tc whether it could te a defendant anyway/

2

but you would say no under
ME. GEOGHEGANs

3

1983?
Your Honor, that would te cur

4

contention.

You are correct.

The Eleventh Amendment,

5

of course, world net apply in state court.
Our point is that the State of Kentucky has

6
7

prevailed in this case on absolutely every aspect cn

8

merits, yet the state was saddled with the attorneys*

9

fees.

Now,

the

it is our contention that although the

10

plaintiffs were in fact the prevailing parties as tc the

11

remaining defendants in this case, they were not the

12

prevailing party as to the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and

13

the court erred by awarding attorneys' fees under that

14

Section 1988.

15

The plaintiffs could have obtained attorneys'

16

fees in this particular case from the remaining

17

defendants, but they bargained away those rights in

18

their settlement negotiations.

19

Now, the second issue that I would like to

20

present to the Court today is concerned with the

21

Eleventh Amendment, and it likewise is a very narrow

22

issue as well.

23

Eleventh Amendment tars a suit in federal court against

24

a state by a

25

This Court has recognized

that the

citizen of the same state or other states.

And in this particular case the trial court
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

recognized this principle and accordingly dismissed tie

2

State of Kentucky.

3

that under the fiction in Ex Parte Young a court may

4

award prospective relief against a state officer in his

5

official capacity enjoining him from carrying out a

6

policy of the state or a state statute which runs afoul

7

of the Constitution.
If the court does that, is to award that kind

8
9

Eut this Court has also recognized

of prospective relief, this Court has then recognized in

10

Hutto v. Finney that it is permissible to award

11

attorneys' fees ancillary to that type of prospective

12

r elief.

13

The reason for that is because the state is in

14

fact for all purposes -- is for all practical purposes

15

the party in

16

This Court has not held likewise with regard to

17

retrospective relief against a state.

18

never held that

19

as to provide retrospective relief against the state.

20

the case, although not named as a party.

This Court has

1983 atrogates the Eleventh Amendment sc

The State of Kentucky would submit that that

21

would apply likewise tc 1988.

Essentially what we are

22

saying is that an attorney's fee has no greater status

23

than the award on the merits that it is ancillary to.

24

And in this case there was nc award on the merits

25

against the State of Kentucky.

It was prohibited by the

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Eleventh Amendment.
The only award at all was against the

2
3

remaining defendants in their individual capacities.

4

Since there was no award on the merits against the State

5

of Kentucky ir this case, then an attorney's fee

6

ancillary is prohibited in the case.

7

QUESTION;

hay I ask one mere question?

8

MR. GEOGHEGAN;

9

QUESTION*

Yes, Your Honor.

Your brief recites that there weie

10

$64,870 some cf costs, of which $58,000 were attorneys’

11

fees.

12

attorneys'

13

the costs not the fees?

There were $10,000 in costs that were not
fees.

What is your position with respect

MR. GEOGHEGAN;

14

Ycur Honor, my position would

15

be the same as the attorneys' fees,

16

we did

part, sc the ether --

19

MR. GEOGHEGAN;

20

QUESTION;

21

MR. GEOGHEGAN;

Your Honor, that is correct.

I see.
For these reasons, I submit

22

that the judgment cf the United States Court of Appeals

23

for the Sixth Circuit should be reversed, and a reversal

24

according tc the arguments that I have made would

25

require no modification of the existing case law of this

OH BEHALF CF THE RESPONEENTS

5

MR. LOWEFY;

6

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it

7

please the Court, I think it would be helpful at the

8

outset tc briefly review the two statutes that are

9

involved in this appeal.
The first, of course, being 1983, simply

10
11

provides that every person who subjects or causes to be

12

subjected another person of a violation of his

13

constitutional rights shall be liable tc that person

14

an action in law, suit in equity, or other proper

15

proceeding -QUESTION;

16
17

ir

How did the state fit into that?

How does the state fit into that statute?
MR. LOWERY;

18

Judge, I guess the best you could

19

say was that counsel named them imprevidently.

Frofatly

20

the worst you could say is they named them ignorantly.
Actually, the truth falls somewhere in

21
22

between.

We were concerned at that point in the case

23

that it might be necessary to make a record, that there

24

might be an issue, the right tc name a state, that the

25

efficacy of the Eleventh Amendment could even be an

And so, to make sure that the State of

2
3

Kentucky received full notice, we named them as a party.

4

New,

6

we do call to the attention of the Court that --

the District Court, we take no issue at all with

If they had never been joined -If they had never been joined,

MR. LOWERY*

Senate reports and House reports say that a fee may be

Now,

that is pure Hutto, as well Mayer against

So, we did name the state.

We did think that

turned out it was net, because the matter was settled

21

and that issue was never raised on appeal.

22

And as it

The other part of the statute that I am

23

referring to here, of course, is 1988, which simply

provides that anyone who vindicates constitutional

rights under

How, as a very preliminary and basic response

to the argument that only injunctive relief,

5

retrospective relief will trigger the workings of

I simply look at the wording of 1983.

7

And had

1988,

I been requested by Congress to sit

8

down and help them draft an all-inclusive provision, cne

9

not restricted to retrospective relief, but one that

10

included a bread arsenal of legal remedies available to

11

those whose constitutional rights were violated,

12

believe I could improve on this language.

13

I dcr't

I was taught that an action at law means to go

14

into court and ask for damages, and a suit in equity is

15

a suit where you undertake to get injunctive relief.

think it is self-evident as far as the wording itself of

17

Section 1983 is concerned.

18

We

The real question, it seems to me, is what was

19

the intent of Congress in enacting 1988?

intend to make it restrictive?

why

1

don't you bring that in?
HE. LOWERY;

2

All right, sir.

As far as the

3

Eleventh Amendment is concerned, we are faced with

4

Edelman, the Ed elm an case.

not brought under 1S83.

involved in Edelman, but it was a case in which

Then you come along with Hayer against Gagney

that says If

the Eleventh Amendment ever barred suits cf

this nature,

it was discharged by Congress in 1988.

20

There is a concurring opinion in Hutto that suggests

21

that that is a burning question now.

22

But in my view it is a question that does net

23

have to be reached in this case because here we are

24

dealing with attorneys’ fees and attorneys’ fees only,

25

which are different.

Attorneys' fees are different,
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

it, attorneys* fees are not damages.
