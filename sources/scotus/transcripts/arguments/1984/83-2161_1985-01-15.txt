Justice O'Connor, it can't.

The

10

taxation provision can't, I think, because the taxation

11

provision allows for taxation of oil and gas and other

12

minerals on the unallotted treaty reservation lands.

13

The leasing part of that Act only permits the Secretary

14

to enter into long-term leases for oil and gas on those

16

I think the only grammatical and

logical way

17

to read that taxation provision is that it applies for

all mineral productions on those unallotted treaty

reservation lands.

20

inclusion of other minerals in that taxation provision

-- that is, minerals other than the ones that the
