ORAL ARGUMENT OF BURCK BAILEY, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BAILEY;

9

Mr.

Chief Justice and may it

10

please the' Court, on the night of October 4 , 1980,

an

11

Oklahoma City police officer named Julian Rotramel shot

12

and killed a man named William Tuttle.
The shooting occurred outside a bar in

13
14

Oklahoma City called the "We'll Do Club."

The bar was

15

located in what Plaintiff's expert called an

16

interstitial city area, what he described as a rough

17

part of town.
The events leading up to the shooting are

18
19

unusual.

The evidence was that Mr. Tuttle was a

20

frequent patron of the bar, and that day he had been in

and out of it several different times.

23

and his despondency had caused him on a previous

24

occasion following a quarrel with his wife to slash his

25

wrist in the bar.

He was said to

to all officers, and there were two officers patrcling

separately in the general vicinity of the bar.

One of

10

them was Julian Eotramel, a rockie police officer whc

He was within eight or nine

What happened after he went into the club is

21

in sharp dispute in the testimony.

Ectramel’s testimony

22

was that he walked into the darkened bar -- it was a

23

so-called "blind" building, concrete blocks, with a

24

single door that operated on a trap spring that closed

25

behind ycu -- and fcund the person later found to be

position that under no circumstance was the evidence

2

sufficient to go to the jury because there was no proof

3

of any official policy or customs promulgated by the

4

City of Oklahoma City under the Monell standard,

that the court’s instruction on a single incident deemed

sufficient to let the tryers of fact infer an official

The objection was made,

that that is an insufficient objection and doesn't

preserve the record at the -- on the record, as it were,

following the giving of the instructions.
QUESTION;

5

That had been aired in

Is there anything in the record

6

that would enable us to figure out for ourselves whether

7

the trial judge full well knew the meaning cf the

object ion?
MR. BAILEY;

9

Yes,

Your Honor, there is because

10

this was also raised in pretrial briefs, that is, the

11

single incident objection of the City.

12

central part of dispute between these parties from the

13

beginning.
QUESTION;

14

It was a very

Sc you say the term "single

15

incident" used by the Assistant City Attorney had taken

16

on a nomenclature that meant something more than just

17

the words alone might mean to the trial judge?
HE. BAILEY;

18
19

20

that,

I think there’s no question of

Your Honor.
QUESTION;

But, Mr. Bailey, was there other

21

evidence besides the single incident on the questions of

22

policy or custom?

23

MR. BAILEY;

We take the position there was no

24

other evidence on the issue of policy or custom.

25

was evidence from the Plaintiff's expert that the

deal with an armed robtery situation.

The case was tried on that basis, as I see it.

4

Your Honor.

5

contention that the State -- that the City was grossly

6

negligent in the training that it gave Officer Rotramel,

7

and that that consituted a deliberate indifference tc

8

the rights of the citizens of Oklahoma City.

10

The Plaintiff’s case was predicated on a

QUESTIONi

But did net bear on whether there

was a policy cf training which was inadequate?
MR. BAILEY:

11

Well, that is our position,

12

Your Honor, that that in and of itself is no showing of

13

an official policy.

14

City of Oklahoma City has an official policy of

15

inadequately training its officers is preposterous.

16

there was no proof cf any pattern or tradition of

17

misbehavior or any other evidence whatever of any

18

aberrant police behavior.

Tc state, it seems to me, that the

There was — this record is barren of that.

QUESTION 4

Is that the kind of evidence that

you say would have tended to support their case?
MR. BAILEY*

I'm not even sure if I would say

4

that, but that is evidence that certainly would point in

5

that direction, that there would be some misbehavior on

6

the part of the police, not necessarily shootings.

7

don’t really mean it has to rise to that level of

8

seriousness, but some showing of an insensitivity to

9

constitutional rights that the City Council would be

10
11

I

able to infer that the City's training was not adequate.
I would suggest. Your Honor, that it's a

12

difficult proposition, logically,

13

can be held to any negligence standard for training its

14

police officers.

15

case because there's no proof of any other instance,

16

other than this single event, this single incident.

17

to say that the City

Fut I don't need to say that in this

QUESTION*

Well, Mr. Bailey, would you take

18

the position tha,t liability could be imposed under

19

Monell, based on a single incident of misconduct,

20

coupled with independent evidence of inadequate training

21

or supervision?

/

22

Is that enouch?

23

ER. BAILEYs

I don't think it is enough,

24

Your Honor.

I don't think so, because just recently,

25

about two months ago, since our briefs closed, there’s a
10

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Fourth Circuit opinion that I think speaks to

2

Your Honor's point.

3

There, an automobile accident victim sued the

4

City of Newport News, saying that the City had grossly,

5

negligently trained its police officers in knowing how

6

to give medical treatment tc an automobile victim, and

7

that she had been injured, her spine was injured as a

8

result of them putting her in a cab instead of in an

9

ambula nee.
And if you -- there's no logical stopping

10
11

point,

we would submit, if you caa predicate municipal

12

liability solely on a contention that they negligently

13

trained an officer or a fireman or a meter reader.

14

There is — it opens up Section 1983 to simple fort

15

act ion s.
QUESTION*

16

What if the city or town adopted a

17

policy of hiring police with nc training at all?

18

that amount to the equivalent of knowledge, constructive

19

knowledge?

20

NR. EAILEYi

I've thought about that,

21

Your Honor, and frankly I doubt that there is a

22

constitutional duty on the part of a city tc train

23

police officers at all.

24
25

I expect that there are hundreds of
municipalities that hire police officers with no

3

shot the suspected prowler had no training whatsoever.

And indeed, in the Languirand case in

Is it not true that many, or at

(202) 628-9300

Police Academy, which the former Oklahoma City Police
Chief testified was rated by the FBI as the third test
in the nation, for 18 weeks, 7C0 hours of training.
The Plaintiff, through Dr. Kirkham, a
criminologist from Florida, testified that he had
studied the curriculum and that it did not contain mere
than 24 minutes of time devoted to the response to an
armed robbery call, and that that was grossly
deficient.

That was his testimony.
The testimony from the police side was

different from that.

It was that the training was

extremely sophisticated and thorough and complete.
The problem I see with that, Your Honor, is
that the curriculum was extensive.

Part of it is

established by the state law of Oklahoma, what a police
officer must study.

It would te difficult, I would

think, for the Court to fashion a test as to what
curriculum needs to be taught in every city police
department in the country.

There vast differences of

opinion about that, I think, among knowledgeable
professionals.
QUESTION:

Well, independently of the

challenge you make to the instruction, suppose we were
to agree with you that the instruction was error.

Would

we then have to address whether the rest of the evidence

sufficed to support a finding of policy or custom?
ifR. BAILEY;

3

Your Honor.

I doutt that you would have tc,

I think we would like for the Court to do

i

4

sc.

It just strikes us that a contention that the

5

training an officer receives is the springboard tc

6

municipal liability is a hazardous test.

7

QUESTION;

Mr. Bailey, it seems tc me yet are

8

making quite a different argument than the question

9

presented in the cert petition, which was focused cn the

10

single incident point, rather than whether training can

11

ever be -- kind of training can ever be a policy.

12

Are you abandoning your single incident --

13

MF. BAILEY;

No, not at all, Your Honor.

14

is, we

think that's our strongest point, and we are

15

urging

that to the Ccurt.

16

insufficient -QUESTION;

17

That

Fut. we think that there was

Cn that point, is it your position

18

that the single incident could never give rise to 1983?

19

I was thinking about a hypothetical case where you might

20

have a

21

something, an absurd hypothetical, T recognize.

policy of shoot to kill traffic offenders cr

But suppose you had a very extreme, very

22
23

dangerous policy, and the first implementation of the

24

policy

resulted in a tragic death.

Could that ever

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

HR. BAILEY;

1

Your Honor, I think, that points

2

up an interesting distinction in this case.

If that

3

were the policy, shoot to kill, as you suggest, or shoot

4

on mere suspicion, it seems to me that policy just

5

wouldn't pass constitutional muster.

6

not.

That policy would

Here, the policy of the City of Oklahoma City

7

8

on the use of firearms was, hy Plaintiff's own expert

9

witness, ideal.

And the position taken in the trial

10

court by Plaintiff was that. Rotramel departed from City

11

policy which said an officer can use his weapon only in

12

defense of life when the suspect is armed or threatening

13

great bodily harm, and he must always use the utmost

14

discretion with due respect for the sanctity of human

15

life,

that sort of

thing.

QUESTION;

16

But then if that's your theory, you

17

are really saying that the evidence doesn't show an

18

invalid policy.

19

three incidents or nine incidents or one incident, I

20

suppos e.

And that would be true if there were

HE. BAILEY;

21

Your Honor, there’s a dichotomy

22

there.

The City policy now, in Plaintiff’s brief, is

23

being questioned.

24

contention was that the officer was grossly inadequately

25

trained, not that the City policy was bad, tut that the

At the trial, it never was.

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

The

1

policy in the sense that they grossly inadequately

2

trained the officer was flawed.

3

at trial.

4

QUESTION:

That was the contention

Well, and yet the instructions do

5

say the existence cf such a policy is a question of fact

6

for you to determine, and that was the question;

7

there was a policy of putting unqualified people cn the

8

street .
MR. BAILEY:

9

whether

That's correct, Ycur Honor, not

10

that -- I doubt in all — I doubt in all truth that the

11

training the officer received had anything to do with

12

this incident.

13

they —

14

I’ve thought about that.

QUESTION:

But the jury seems to come to a

15

different conclusion.

16

jury decided on the basis cf instructions.

17

MR. BAILEY:

I think if

We have to deal with what the

I'm not

— the jury found in

18

favor of the officer, Your Honor, as you will recall.

19

They found in favor of the officer and aaainst the

20

Plaintiff on the Plaintiff's suit against the officer,

21

presumably on the good faith qualified immunity that

22

exists for the benefit of City employees, but we don't

23

know that for sure, and against the City.

24
25

And that has been the pattern, Your Honor, in
these cases that are cited -- some are not cited .
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

In

1

very recent cases, there's an awful lot of litigation in

2

this area going on.

3

favor of the officers and against the municipality.

4

they are — in the cases we’ve cited, it’s astonishing

5

that they are all for $1,500,000, all four of them.
QUESTION;

6

But the juries return verdicts in

Well,

P.nd

juries return verdicts in

7

favor of railroads, or against railroads and in favor of

8

engineers, too, in personal injury cases.
Isn’t part of your argument, as least as I

9
10

understood you to have been previously making it, that

11

no matter what one says about the Oklahoma City policy

12

of training officers, that isn’t the same kind of policy

13

as the New York City policy about maternity leaves that

14

was involved in Bonell .
ME. BAILEY:

15

It’s not the same at all,

16

Your Honor.

17

official policy of the City which didn't pass

18

constitutional muster.
QUESTIONi

19

20

Monell was a specific, express, written,

And it also was a policy that

directly affected constitutional rights.
MR. BAILEY:

21

with that.

That's true.

Yes, Your Honor, I

22

agree

And this query, whether there’s any

23

constitutional right that the body has to a certain

24

quality of training by City employees.

25

that's true.

I’m not certain

10

MR. BAILEY:

11

QUESTION;

I think he did, Your Honor.
And did he say that a sinale

12

instance, or did he imply that a single instance of

13

gross negligence or recklessness or disregard could

14

amount tc a policy?

15

MR. BAILEY;

16

QUESTION;

17

MR. BAILEY:

18
19

Specifically.

Yes, Your Honor.

There were no objections to that?
There was an objection to that

language, as I was responding to Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

I thought part of your argument and

20

part ot the question that you raised in your cert

21

petition was that a single instance of gross negligence

22

or of careless disregard, reckless disregard, could

23

never amount to a policy.

24
25

MR. BAILEY:

Well, that's true, Your Honor,

and that was objected to.

HR. BAILEY:

Put if you

I quite agree, Ycur Honor.
Well —
There was a motion for directed

proof,

There was a motion for judgment

16

which was denied on the single incident basis.

notwithstanding the verdict made.
QUESTION:

17

And the Court cf Appeals seems to

18

have agreed that a single instance of gross negligence

19

could amount to a policy.
MR. BAILEY:

20

Well, that's -- I think they had

21

to agree with that, because that’s the only proof in the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARL HUGHES, ESQ.

1

ON. EEHAIF OF THE RESPONDENT

2

MR. HUGHES;

3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

4

please

5

verdict rendered in the Western District of Oklahoma, as

6

affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the

7

Tenth

Circuit.
The issue before this Court is not whether the

8
9

the Court, this is an appeal from the jury

City of Oklahoma City should have to pay damages tc the

10

estate of William Adam Tuttle; the overall question of

11

liability depends on a number of issues which are simply

12

not before this Court.
First, liability depends in large part upon

13
14

resolution of factual issues which were resolved by the

15

jury in the case and are subject to limited review, due

15

to the provisions of the Seventh Amendment.
Second, most of the legal issues were

17
18

addressed in instructions given by the Court which were

19

simply either unobjected to or objected to in such a way

20

as to be insufficient under Rule 51.
And, third, any other issues, other issues

21

22

that have been discussed here this morning simply aren’t

23

raised

24
25

by the cert petition.
In this case, the policy, the case was

submitted to the jury in the court's instructions on

(202) 628-9300

three separate theories; one, that the shooting itself
was justified under the policies of the City cf Oklahoma
City.

As I was interested in Mr. Bailey's concessicn

that if they'd a shoot to kill, shoot on suspicion
policy, that that would have been -- would net have
passed

constitutional muster and would have been a basis

for liability, and that's precisely what the evidence
showed at the trial.
The chief of police testified, and it was a
matter of evidence, it was a matter of factual issue
that was resolved against the City, that the officer was
entitled to shoot on the basis of suspicion, if he had
any suspicion that his life was in danger.
Very briefly, the facts, as opposed to being
in a light most favorable to the City, in a light most
favorable to Mr. Tuttle, who prevailed in the trial
court,

showed that Mr.

Rotranel did go into the bar and

was advised — it was not a nark bar, but it was a
well-lit bar -- that he was advised upon entering the
bar, he asked about an armed robbery,

the bartender,

another bartender advised him that there was no armed
robbery in progress.

I'd rather not emphasize

Going back to your statement about

whether the officer thought his life was in danger, if

the officer in a given situation, an officer believes

that his life is in danger, you are saying he is not

20

entitled to shoot?

21

MR. HUGHES:

Of course, that issue is net

22

preserved and presented in this case.

I say that there

23

has to be more than just a totally unfounded belief that

24

his life was in danger, just a mere suspicion.

25

there was no -- nothing mere than that in the evidence

(202) 628-9300

And

1

in the light most favorable to the -QUESTION;

2

Well, the jury's verdict would

3

suggest, at least it is susceptible of a meaning that

4

the jury thought that the police officer did have a

5

reasonable basis tc think his life was in danger, and

6

therefore they excused him.
MR. HUGHES;

7

That's a concern that I have

8

about an appellate court reviewing factual

9

determinations that were made at the trial.

This court

10

in the record doesn't illustrate, and you can't see —

11

tried the case and I did see the timidity.

12

of like Mr. Creeper leaves the Marine Corps and goes on

13

the Oklahoma City Police Force with a gun.

It was sort

You can't see the attitude of Rotramel.

14

I

mean he didn't, to me at least, portray the attitude of

16

a Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry.

Hew it was portrayed tc you or to

18

some judge is not as important as how the jury viewed

him.

20

they thought he was justified.

I would read the jury's verdict; that he was justified

22

in what he did.

23

I

Mow, the jury returned a verdict indicating that

MR. HUGHES;

At least that's the way

I didn't -- I respectfully

24

disagree -- read that it went that far; that it merely

25

held that he was in good faith in what he did.

In other

words,

that he thought he was complying with the policy,

2

that he thought he was passing consitutional muster, but

3

that’s simply not what the facts illustrated and what

4

the jury resolved.
QUESTION;

5

Mr. Hughes, a moment age you said

6

that the policy that was relied upon by you as Plaintiff

7

was a policy of Oklahoma City to allow shooting on

8

suspicion.
I am looking at the Court of Appeals * opinion ,

9
10

page 7A and 8A of the petition for certiorari.

And it

11

seems to me they devote one paragraph to the question of

12

policy there, and the only policy they talk about is

13

negligence and gross negligence and supervising.

14

don’t mention the policy that you refer to.

They

Are you saying that the Court of Appeals

15
16

upheld

the policy contention on the basis that you’re

17

talking about of a policy of shooting on suspicion?

QUESTION :

1

2

Did the Court of Appeals mention

that in its opinion?
HR. HUGHES:

3

I don’t recall them mentioning

it, but the issue wasn’t before them in that context and

5

in that posture.

6

resolved in the trial court, we take less up to the next

7

level,

8

that was addressed in the instructions, in unobjected to

9

instructions in the trial court.

And I think when the issues are

QUESTIGH:

10

Hell, that may be, but if the Court

11

of Appeals affirmed on some ground that the policy was

12

negligent training or deliberate disregard of rights in

13

training, if that’s the policy they identified -- and if

14

they were wrong in that, I don’t know that we should

15

affirm on your ground.
MR. HUGHES;

16

Well, of course, that’s, in my

17

view,

18

object to the instructions, object to the problems, and

19

properly preserve the error, and it's simply not

properly preserved.

You knew, we have to

I mean the only objection to the instructions

22

that’s in the record, and I take issue with the

23

statements about matters that occurred outside the

25

objection that’s in the instruction is quoted in full at

footnote 62 at page 45 of our brief.
We make a second objection, Ycur Honor,

2
3

particularly to the one, the Oklahoma City language, the

4

language in the light cf the City of Oklahoma City,

5

which is the single occurrence language. That is simply

6

the only matter that was objected to in the trial court

7

and preserved for review, and I don't think that

8

preserves anything.

9

QUESTION:

Do you agree that the trial court

10

instructed the jury that a single instance of gross

11

negligence, cr however you want to describe it, that you

12

may infer a policy from that?

13

HR. HUGHES:

Well -Do you agree or not?

Yes cr no?

That language is contained in the

instructions , yes.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. HUGHES:

19

QUESTION:

Sc you do agree with that?
Yes.
Sc that it's possible that the jury

20

concluded that there was a single instance of gross

21

negligence, and that was a policy, was enough for a

22

policy .
And didn't the Court of Appeals agree to

23
24
25

that?
MR. HUGHES:

The Court of Appeals agreed that

(202) 628-9300

the instructions should be taken as a whole
QUESTION:

Yeah.

Well, didn’t the Court of

Appeals agree that a policy could be made out from a
single instance of gross negligence?
HR. HUGHES:
QUESTION:

I believe that they did.
Is that a question of law or of

fact?
HR. HUGHES:

In the light of this case, I

thought it was a question of fact.
QUESTION:

Well, certainly the trial judge

seemed to think so.
MR. HUGHES:

I would say that’s a fair and

accurate statement.
QUESTION:

Although he did instruct the jury,

as a matter cf law, that it could be made out from a
single instance.
MR. HUGHES:

He did say that.

Of course,

I

don't see that as an issue that's -- there were mere
issues than the single — there were more theories than
the single incident theory,

than the shcoting itself,

that were presented.
Training, supervision, as well as the policy
of shoot to kill and shoot to center mass were
presen ted.

And the issue is even narrower.

The issue is

17

what is presented by the cert question, and the issue

comes dcwn to, as I see it, whether or not -- whether we

19

have to prove the one free bite theory; whether a single

20

incident, taken together with training, an independent

21

proof of a policy is sufficient.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Hughes, it seemed tc me that

23

basically the theory proceeded on by the Plaintiffs

24

belcw was that an isolated incident, plus evidence cf

25

the training that was given police officers, was enough
32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

to establish the liability here.
And what that argument boils down to, as far

2
3

as I ran understand it, is that other procedures in

4

terms of training a police officer would have reduced

5

the likelihood that Cfficer Potramel would have used

6

excessive force.

7

Is that the thrust of the theory?

8

HE. HUGHES:

9

QUESTION:

I would say so.
Well, didn't Rizzo v. Goode reject

10

that very approach as the basis for liability under

11

1983?

12

rejected that.

It seemed to me that in Rizzo, this Court

Policy plus causation.

Well, didn’t Rizzo deal with

In any event, the

19

theory presented to the Court at this time by the City

20

is that Rotramel departed by City policy.

presented irtfjthe trial court was that Ectramel’s actions

22

were in complete compliance with City policy.
