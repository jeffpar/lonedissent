Hew afccut a close friend cf someone

MB. COME:

3

Hell,

T think that that might ret

4

be sufficient because the Beard over the years has

5

refined its lunit exclusion policy and has adopted the

6

factors that were articulated by the Seventh Circuit in

7

the Caravelle case, and in looking at those factors,

8

what the Board looks at is how high a

9

stock a parent or spouse owns, how many of the

percentage cf the

10

shareholders are related to cne another, whether the

11

shareholder is actively engaged in management or holds

13

compared with the total number of employees, and whether

14

the relative lives in the same household or not.

Sc in short,

the Fcard's policy of family

2

exclusion furthers the basic purpose of the Act of

3

ensuring effective collective bargaining and avoiding

4

conflicts in bargaining once a bargaining agent is

5

s elect ed .

6

Secondly, the exclusion of such employee

7

relatives furthers collective bargaining in that the

8

presence of such a close relative in union discussions

9

is likely tc be viewed with suspicion

and distrust by

10

the ether employees and put a damper on union

deliberations.
