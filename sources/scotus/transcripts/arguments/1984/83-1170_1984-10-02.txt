Respondent had not even carried its burden of

presenting -- had not in any event presented a prima

compensation award might be, the District Court

5

observing that the only testimony proffered by

6

Respondent pertained to the site they had actually

7

acquired, a site that was three times as large as the

8

site that was taken, and the District Ccurt also

9

observing that the testimony suggested

that Respondent

10

had paid in excess of fair market value for its

11

substitute site.

12

The Court of Appeals reversed.

The Court of

13

Appeals conceded that this case was, in their language,

14

rather different from a typical substitute facilities

15

case in that in this case fair market -- there was no

16

claim that fair market value was either unavailable cr

17

unworkable* nevertheless concluded that Respondent was

18

entitled to have its compensation measured by reference

19

to the cost of the substitute facility.

20

The Court of Appeals did attach a significant

21

caveat, however, to that holding.

22

Respondent was not entitled to the benefit of the

23

advantages that accrued from purchasing a larger site,

24

and that on remand, the case was remanded for a new

trial sc that on remand the jury could be instructed to

site.
The government’s position, as it has been

throughout this case,

8

standard, which is ordinarily preferred in this Court’s

9

cases,

10

is that the fair market value

is the proper measure of compensation for the

taking of Respondent’s landfill site.
In the final analysis, our submission is that

11
12

what is lacking in the Court of Appeals rationale and in

13

Respondent's argument is any explanation of what is —

14

what is defective about the preferred fair market value

standard of compensation.

The point is that various individuals may have

any common standard and a just compensation clause that

there has to be a kind of lingua franca, a common

standard of compensation, and Justice Frankfurter

The Court has also observed that the fair

QUESTION;

11

Well, okay, would it include the

12

fact that inevitably this local government is going to

15

secondly, because it is going to have tc make a

16

MR. SCHWARTZ;

We are not satisfied that

injustice, and I would like

to explain why that is so.

6

We don't think that the obligation to replace

reasons, and most of what I have to say follows the line

of analysis that is in Justice White's concurring

opinion in the Lutheran Synod case.

Certainly private entities frequently have

is homeowners, hold their property for use and net for

KB. SCHNABTZ;

We are aware of that, and in

15

our brief we have made our choice.

16

fair market value standard is the applicable one.

17

cases generally suggest that that is true, that fair

18

market value should he paid when it is in excess of the

19

substitute facility's ccst, and the reasoning behind

20

that is whether or not the municipality actually cheeses

21

to make that use of its property, if it owns property

22

and has the legal right to sell it, it has -- it could,

23

at least hypothetically , sell it in the marketplace,

24

take the money, and then recreate that -- carry out its

compensation is just indemnification, and this Court has

the adoption of certain workable rules, and that we have
