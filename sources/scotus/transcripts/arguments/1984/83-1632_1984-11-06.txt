In Fetruary of 1977,

1

shortly after leaving

2

office, President Ford signed a publishing agreement

3

with Harper 8 Few and the Reader's Digest tc publish his

4

memoirs.

5

Trevor Armbrister,

work began almost at once, on a project that was to take

7

two years,

President Ford retained an experienced

writer,

to assist him in that task, and the

that is, the writing of the book.

8

The District Court has detailed findings of

9

the extensive work that went into that, and I'll just

10

mention one or two of those facts.

11

Trevor Armbrister met with President Ford on

12

200 separate occasions for interviews, and each of those

13

interviews lasted two hours each.

Trevor Armbrister took that material and he

22

took material of almost equal mass from his interviews

23

with others, togetner with a mountain of material from

24

public records and the like, and then cut of that he

25

prepared a manuscript for President Ford.

President Ford reviewed that manuscript wcrd

2

for word, and he then reviewed three subsequent

3

revisions word for word before finally giving his okay

4

for the iranuscript tc be published.

5

approximately two years later. Harper £ Row's subsidiary

6

right department began to contact newspapers and

7

magazines tc ascertain if any cf them were interested in

publishing excerpts frcm this book prior to book

The agreement also provided that if for any

reason material from Chapters 1 and 3 of the manuscript

have the right to renegotiate the second installment of

Working quickly over a weekend, he rushed into

8

print with an article that was derived almost

9

exclusively from the memoirs.

Eighty percent of it was

10

from the memoirs, and what wasn’t from the memoirs was

11

either introduction or conclusion, or a few transition

That particular material was the

material that President Ford created as he wrote the

It also included President Ford's assessment

of Nixon's character, which President Ford had written

16

out in longhand during that interviewing process that I

described, and that also was copied verbatim by Nation

18

in the article.

QUESTION;

Mr. Miller, do you take the

license publication of those facts,

MR. MILLER:

The Court of Appeals did a

a higher number.

that there could be a violation of copyright.

4

MR. MILLER;

Justice

White, that there could be a violation in that

situation, but that, of course, isn't the situation

here.

QUESTION;

Mr. Miller, do you think that the

16

fact that it was an unpublished work expands ycur

17

definition of what is protectable under the copyright

18

law, or is the fact that it was unpublished in your view

19

just one element of determining Fair Use?

20

ME. MILLER;

I think the fact that it wasn't

21

published doesn't expand the scope of what is

22

protectable, but it is certainly a very important factor

23

in determining Fair Use.

24
25

QUESTION;

Mr. Miller, it would be helpful to

me, in trying to focus cn the difference between ycur

passages that you think are clearly copyrightable, ard

3

they think are not, because talking in generalities, it

4

is always a little hard to focus on what the difference

5

is.

6

MR. MILLEKi

President Ford has a discussion

7

in the book that describes his discussions with

8

Alexander Haig during that eight-day period prior to the

9

time that he became President.

He covered a let cf that

10

same material in the Hungate testimony, but the material

11

in the look, if you compare the two, has quite a

12

different emphasis from what it has in Hungate.

13

material in the book includes President Ford’s sujective

14

feelings about those events.

15

The

He tells how, for example. President Nixon had

16

reassured him ever manj months that he would ultimately

prevail, and that the facts would justify him.

material was revealed.

he received from various people, and the advice that he

10

Eresident Ford describes many factors that

Cur position is that the totality of that

11

expression, including the advice and the reaction that

12

Ford had to it represents Ford's expression.

13

position, as I understand it, is that what one should do

14

in determining copyrightability is to look at each cf

15

those little pieces of advice separately and say, well,

16

this is not copyrightable, and therefore that is not

17

entitled to further consideration.

The Nation

We both agree that the Ruth Memorandum per se

18
19

is not copyrightable.

20

entire expression, including the Ruth Memorandum and the

2T

impact it had on him, represents copyrightable

expression as it has been traditionally viewed by the

23

courts.

might affect Fair Use, tut after the beck is published.

10

I think our position is that before the book is

published. President Fcrd cught to have the same right

12

that any author has, the right of first publication.

13

President Ford took two years to write this book.

I would like to also just go back to the

copyrightability point.

The majority, in addition tc

23

the twc ether factcrs that I mentioned, also gave nc

24

consideration to the paraphrasing here, stating that

25

paraphrasing is the equivalent cf copying only if the

2

that the cases don't support that interpretation of a

copyright.

4

We submit

In essence, the majority imposed these --

5

applied these limited restrictions on copyrightalility

because cf its belief that to do otherwise would give

7

President Ford a monopoly over facts.

that is not true.

9

protection for his expression of those facts.

It would only give President Ford

Furthermore, that protection is not unlimited.

QUESTION :

Do I understand you to say that if

15

President Ford, in his memoirs, revealed that an event

16

that no one had ever known about before and he described

17

that event, do you say that no cne cculd reveal that

18

event without violating his copyright?
HE. MILLEE:

19

20

They could certainly reveal the

information, but they couldn't take his expression.
QUESTION:

21

Yes.

It is just a question of when

22

in the process of revealing the event, they are close

enough tc his expression tc get in trouble?

question is, is that true or net?

not to say that.

Is it a pretext or

In Wainwright, the Second Circuit said

that it was a pretext.
You can't just say that it's news reporting

and make it news reporting.

reporting is set forth by Congress, at least, as an
