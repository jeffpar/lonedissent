CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. BAXLEY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BAXLEY:

8

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
10

This is a res judicata due process question that

11

we're here on today.

12

quote out of a case of Chase National Bank v. Norwalk.

13

Justice Brandeis said, unless duly summoned to appear in a

14

legal proceeding, a person not a privy may rest assured

15

that a judgment recovered therein will not affect his

16

legal rights.

17

To lead in, I'd like to give a short

That quote was also cited by Mr. Chief Justice

18

in the Martin v. Wilks case and quoted along with some

1

other quotes from Justice Brandeis in that case.

20

The second little lead-in quote I'd like to

21

give -- because it was cited, the case was cited by the

22

respondent.

23

v. Texas International, and they quoted Judge Widdeson as

24

saying, quote, denial of the opportunity to bring a suit

25

raises serious due process questions.

It's a Fifth Circuit case, Southwest Airlines

Further in the opinion, they quote, again, Judge

1

2

Widdeson, because res judicata denies a nonparty his day

3

in court, the Due Process Clause prevents preclusion when

4

the relationship between the party and the nonparty

5

becomes too attenuated.
In this instance, it's not only a attenuated

6
7

relationship, there's a nonexistent relationship.

8

absolutely --

9

QUESTION:

There's

Well, Mr. Baxley, there -- your

10

opponents cite a string of cases, many of them State

11

cases, in which some kind of claim preclusion doctrine, or

12

res judicata, if you will, has been applied despite a

13

change in the identity of the plaintiff taxpayer in suits

14

by citizens challenging tax laws in State court.

15

there is that body of authority, and how do you deal with

16

that, and what's the extent of it?

17

MR. BAXLEY:

Now,

All of those cases that they cited

18

in that footnote, only two or three of them do I think

19

really have application that they should have to be

20

arguable.

21

them are State cases.

22

case from this Court or even a circuit court that they

23

cited in that footnote.

24
25

All of them are State cases.

I believe all of

I don't believe there's a single

I think common sense is the best answer.

These

are cases that I think that the law, especially when

1

you're dealing with a constitutional right to have your

2

case litigated -QUESTION:

3

Well, you take the position that

4

there is no doctrine of claim preclusion in these citizen

5

taxpayer suits in State court?

6

MR. BAXLEY:

I think the position that we would

7

take is -- was enunciated in your dissent, in Justice

8

O'Connor's dissent in the Harper v. Virginia cahe which

9

is

11

MR. BAXLEY:

12

majority, either --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BAXLEY:

But remember, that was a dissent.
But it did not conflict with the

It didn't carry the day.
-- and you quoted United States v.

15

L.A. Tucker Trucking Company and Webster v. Fall, and I

16

think your quote there was something to the effect that

17

questions which are merely lurk in the record have no

18

basis of precedent in --

19

QUESTION:

Well, what if the court in the

20

Bedingfield case here had actually decided the issue that

21

you're raising now, would you be here?

MR. BAXLEY:

It would be a closer question.

I

think that -QUESTION:

And what is your answer?

Would you

then be precluded, a new taxpayer, from bringing the same

2

challenge?
MR. BAXLEY:

I think you could make a good

3

argument that you would not, because of nonprivity under

4

the law as set out by this Court, but I think that --

5

certainly I think that candidly the respondent would have

6

a stronger case, because here this argument, a major

7

constitutional right, has never, ever been decided by any

8

court at any time.

9

It's never been argued.

It was mentioned in one amicus brief at the

10

Alabama supreme court level, just mentioned in passing.

11

You've got a trial court that wrote a five- or six-page

12

opinion that never touched on this major right.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Baxley, just to be clear on

14

what's at issue, if, in fact, the matter had been decided

15

in the prior suit, raised, litigated, and decided, then

16

really it wouldn't be too significant whether you put a

17

preclusion, it wouldn't be a plain preclusion, an issue

18

preclusion label on it, because you'd have precedent from

19

the highest court in your State.

20

You'd be bound by stare decisis, so it

21

wouldn't -- if they actually decided the question, if the

22

Alabama supreme court actually decided the question in the

23

Bedingfield case, then wouldn't you realistically be out

24

of court in your suit?

25

MR. BAXLEY:

I think common-sensewise, yes.

I

1

think you could argue that the claim -- I don't think

2

technically under the law that either res judicata or

3

collateral estoppel would apply.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. BAXLEY:

But how about stare decisis?
Stare decisis I think would be --

6

would be enough to where it would make your burden almost

7

unable -- you couldn't overcome it, but I -- we don't have

8

that --

9
10

QUESTION:

So your case really depends on this

issue not having been fully litigated and decided.
MR. BAXLEY:

11

Not having been litigated in any

12

way, and I think that's the law from this Court,

13

repeatedly.

14

QUESTION:

Well, what if the State of Alabama

15

decides to authorize taxpayer suits not in the sense of

16

people who are being subject to a tax, but in the sense of

17

challenging expenditure of public money?

18

any person in the State who pays taxes may challenge

19

the -- and I think many States have this.

20

State has to allow more than one of those suits?
MR. BAXLEY:

21
22

23

25

In other words,

Do you think a

No, sir, I don't think they have

QUESTION:

Where there really isn't any personal

property interest at stake.
MR. BAXLEY:

I think my answer there would be

1

that you pretty well hit it on the head in Martin v. Wilks

2

in your opinion, where you said it's really, the burden is

3

on the parties, on the parties that are litigating it to

4

determine what the issues are going to be.

5

When this issue was litigated in Bedingfield, if

6

the county had really wanted to come in and have the due

7

process -- I mean, and the due process rights provided and

8

the equal protection matter settled once and for all, they
could have brought it up.

10
11

QUESTION:

They know --

That -- I don't believe that's

responsive to my question.

Listen, please.

12

My question was, if the State says, we're going

13

to authorize taxpayer suits, any taxpayer can come in and

14

claim that the public moneys are being misspent, and A

15

comes in and brings a taxpayer suit saying that you --

16

this is a violation, say, of the First Amendment, the

17

religion clause, for the State to spend money this way,

18

and then that's -- the highest court in the State decides

1

that case against that taxpayer.

20

And then taxpayer B, who wasn't a party to that

21

suit at all, comes in and says, now, I wasn't a party to

22

that suit, I'm bringing a taxpayer's action to challenge

23

that same expenditure of money under the same provision of

24

the Constitution.

25

Now, can a State say, we're just not going to do

1

that, this is a special kind of suit?
MR. BAXLEY:

2

3

I think for the same reason, the

principle of stare decisis that Justice Ginsburg -QUESTION:

4

I'm not talking about stare decisis.

5

I'm talking about, maybe it's a brand-new supreme court of

6

Alabama now, and maybe the supreme court of Alabama might

7

be inclined to depart from its earlier ruling, but can the

8

State simply say, we're not going to entertain this

9

action?
MR. BAXLEY:

10

I don't think they could and get by

11

a due process test if they preclude -- now, if -- in

12

your -- and what -- your example, if somebody came back

13

and raised -- you gave the First Amendment, raised the

14

First Amendment, it had already been decided, yes, I think

15

a statute that set that out would preclude others from

16

doing it.

17

But if then they, somebody came in and said,

18

now, wait a minute, this has not been decided on another

19

constitutional ground, then I don't think that a -- I

20

think a State statute --

21

QUESTION:

What if the law of Alabama is that

22

anything that was -- might have -- was raised in the first

23

taxpayer's action might have been raised is just, it's all

24

over, there isn't going to be another suit, does that

25

violate some provision of the Federal Constitution?

MR. BAXLEY:

1

2

Yes.

I think it violates due

process.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. BAXLEY:

Why?
Because this Court has held

5

basically that and the Alabama supreme court has held that

6

over and over, repeatedly.

7

QUESTION:

Well, held -- are you talking -- you

8

say, held that.

9

court and this Court has held that in the hypothetical

10

You suggest that the Alabama supreme

example I've given you it violates due process?
MR. BAXLEY:

11

If you deny someone the right to

12

fully and- totally litigate a constitutional issue, however

13

you cut him off, whether by case law or by a statute,

14

it would not meet the test of this Court,

15

says the due process rights transcend and,

16

would overcome -- whether it be case law at the State

17

level or a State statute --

18

QUESTION:

then

that this Court
so to speak,

Mr. Baxley, but in many of these

19

instances,

20

even have any right at all to be in court were it not for

21

the grace of the State that allows you to be kind of a

22

private Attorney General.

23

I would think -- your taxpayer is someone who is

24

paying tax and doesn't want to.

1

quite a different animal, are they not?

2

MR. BAXLEY:

3

QUESTION:

Well, I think -Do you have any due process right to

4

bring a case that, if you were in the Federal court,

5

they'd probably say you don't even have standing?
MR. BAXLEY:

6

I think that you always have

7

standing if you've got a major constitutional right that

8

you say is being infringed upon.
QUESTION:

9

That's not -- certainly not true.

I

10

mean, let's assume that you have a -- I mean, we have

11

cases where the Constitution contains a statement of

12

accounts clause, and we have held that a private citizen

13

cannot sue, has no standing to sue to compel the

14

expenditures of the CIA to be disclosed under that

15

provision.

16

We say, maybe it violates the Constitution,

17

maybe it doesn't, but no individual has standing because

18

it's a generalized interest.

19

Now, we have that doctrine at the Federal level

20

because of separation of powers concerns, because we have

21

a distinctive Federal doctrine of separation of powers.

22

The States don't have to follow our separation of powers

23

doctrine, and if they choose to allow a suit in that

24

situation, why is it a denial of due process for them to

25

say, we're going to allow the suit, but only one, whereas

1

we don't allow the suit at all?

2

shape constitutionally than we are?

3

MR. BAXLEY:

How can they be in worse

I think the best answer there is a

4

case of this Court of Waters v. St. Louis, and it's so

5

parallel to the situation we have here.

6

The legislature of Missouri passed a law that

7

said cities of over 700,000 people can impose an

8

occupational tax on businesses and individuals, but they

9

said that on businesses and on proprietors that ran their

10

own businesses they could do it on the net and deduct

11

their taxes.

12

Before the tax actually went into effect, a

13

taxpayer in Missouri filed suit on constitutional grounds.

14

It got to this Court, and I believe it was Justice Jackson

15

who wrote the majority opinion --

16

QUESTION:

But you very carefully and quite

17

appropriately pick a case in which there wouldn't have

18

been standing in Federal courts.

19

suggested by the Chief Justice and by Justice Ginsburg,

20

and I'm suggesting the same thing, is that you're casting

21

your net too widely, that there are certain -- you have --

22

there are certainly some actions in which the State allows

23

a citizen to proceed with a suit where we don't.

24

The construction of a bridge.

25

All that has been

that the construction of a bridge is contrary to law -12

the person is not harmed at all.

2

like Federal money being spent for something it shouldn't

3

be spent for.

4

He just says, I don't

Could he bring suit in Federal court?

No.

He

5

can bring suit in many States simply on the ground that

6

this money shouldn't be expended by the county, or whoever

7

it is.

8

9

Now, your position is that although it's
perfectly okay to deny the suit to anybody, the State

10

cannot say, well, we'll allow the suit, but only once,

11

that the latter violates due process of law, but the

12

former does not.

13

That is not a very appealing proposition.

14

MR. BAXLEY:

I think that the State does not

15

have the right to, by statute or any other way, cut off

16

someone's right to litigate a constitutional issue --

17

QUESTION:

But if you have no right to begin

18

with under the Federal Constitution -- you have a

19

taxpayer, an actual taxpayer who doesn't want to pay tax

20

out of his pocket.

21

what is labeled, taxpayer suit, and what that note in the

22

brief is of -- the other side is filled with what we call

23

taxpayer suits, where someone emerges as champion of the

24

public in general, but is no more affected than the public

25

in general.

Isn't that quite a different case from

MR. BAXLEY:

2

QUESTION:

3

Yes, Your Honor.
But we are talking about real

taxpayers, and that's a little different, isn't it?

4

MR. BAXLEY:

We're talking about real taxpayers,

5

and in the Hansberry v. Lee, this Court said that the

6

State is free to call these actions whatever they want to.

7

They can call them virtual representation, they can call

8

them class actions, if they call them class actions they
can set certain rules, but the State cannot -- whatever

10

they call them, they cannot deny someone's due process

11

rights and -QUESTION:

12

Wait, do you say that a State can't

13

even authorize a class action and have the result of that

14

class action binding on members of the class?

15

MR. BAXLEY:

I think they absolutely can, but I

16

also think you go back to the decision of this Court

17

3 weeks ago, roughly, in the Matsushita case, where -- and

18

your dissent, you say -- I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg

dissent says that a State -- you can have these class

actions.

QUESTION:
case, Mr. Baxley?

MR. BAXLEY:

5

QUESTION:

6

7

What was the name of your Missouri

Waters v. St. Louis, and there's Where is it -- I don't see it in the

index to your brief.
MR. BAXLEY:

Your Honor, it's in our -- I know

8

that it's in our -- oh, the amicus -- the amicus found

9

this case for us, the amicus of the counties found that

10

case and had that in their green brief, and then we, I

11

think, cited it in our reply brief.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. BAXLEY:

Thank you.
But that was Water v. St. Louis,

14

and there is a concurring opinion, two sentences, one

15

paragraph, by Justice Douglas, joined in by Justice Black,

16

where Justice Douglas says that I'll go with the rest of

17

the Court on the reading that the Missouri supreme court

18

has not considered this scheme right now so it's not

19

right, but when it comes up again and is considered, this

20

case -- but I bow to their reading of the record, saving

21

for a future day the serious and substantial question on

22

the Equal Protection Clause raised by the regulations

23

which grant employers deductions for taxes paid the

24

Federal Government, yet do not allow employees a deduction

25

for the same tax.

1

Now, when this first case came --

2

QUESTION:

Well, that sounds like a case in

3

which the employees and the employers all had some

4

property interest that was being taken away from them by

5

the tax.
I mean, they were being able -- they were being

6

7

required to pay the tax.
MR. BAXLEY:

8

9
10

That's what we have here, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

I know it is, but the questions we

11

have been propounding to you are -- which you simply

12

haven't responded to, at least so far as I can tell, are

13

the other situations, where, as Justice Ginsburg puts it,

14

you have a taxpayer's action where the taxpayer is really

15

a private Attorney General saying, we don't like -- we

16

think this money is being spent in violation of the

17

Constitution, even though they suffer no particularized

18

injury, and the question is whether that kind of a case

19

isn't perhaps different.

20
21
22

MR. BAXLEY:

I think it is different.

I think

it's very different.
QUESTION:

Well then, in order to agree with

23

you, we don't have to go as far as you initially urged us,

24

to say that in every case where a State allows suit it has

25

to allow that a later plaintiff can bring the same suit.

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, it seems to me that that's the

only point you need sustain, that in the type of a lawsuit

1

I think that there are really four cases.

2

There's another case that I think is very much in point

3

about bringing this up again, when it involves a basic

4

constitutional right, and this was a case that, again,

5

they found for us.

6

Respondents cited it.

It's Quong Wing v. Kirkpatrick, I believe, the

7

Montana case, and they cited it I suppose because it

8

looked like it was a horrible case for us on the equal
protection issue, but when I read that case, lo and

10

behold, Justice Holmes -- it was a case where the State of

11

Montana had imposed a what looked like blatantly

12

discriminatory tax aimed at the Chinese laundries.

13

And Justice Holmes mentioned in the opinion that

14

in oral argument he tried to ask the counsel that was

15

arguing about the equal protection issue and counsel

16

wouldn't respond, denied it, might have been asleep like I

17

was when Justice Scalia was asking me.

18

But Justice Holmes said in his opinion, he said

1

that we brought this up, this is going to come up again,

20

and when it does come up again, and laws are frequently

21

attacked by -- that the lawyers don't give the Court

22

anything to sustain them and we don't want to sustain

23

them, but when this issue comes up again, when it's

24

properly attacked, because’it's a constitutional issue,

25

that if it comes up again we're going to rule with them.

So I would think that Justice Holmes would be

1

2

wondering -- if he thought that that opinion would be

3

cited in later days by people in the position of

4

respondents, saying that this opinion does not allow the

5

same party to attack it on the constitutional issue -- he

6

said they could.

7

that that opinion by Justice Holmes prevented every future

8

American of Chinese ancestry to not attack a ruling on

9

that basis because the issue could have been raised and

How horrified he would be if they said

I do not think it would be an exaggeration to

say that if this Court were to adopt the petitioners'

7

truncated view of the Due Process Clause with respect to

representational suits, that they would overturn several

hundred years of equitable development of class actions as

culminating in Rule 23 of the Federal Rule of Civil

Procedure.

attacking class actions.

Justice Souter, I believe that

others, of Martin v. Wilks, totally ignoring footnote

implications of that case the whole panoply of

Hansberry v. Lee, and also the second cite in the footnote

QUESTION:

called Mullane v. Hanover Bank, where the Court explained

if someone's interest is being affected there has to be an

effort to tell that person, not the best service that

taxpayer action, which is where these cases originated,

3

but that isn't this.

4

This is a case, isn't it, like a bunch of 10,000

5

people living in a city, and the city puts up some noxious

6

fumes, and all 10,000 people breathe them, so they want to

7

proceed against a nuisance, so there's a giant accident,

8

and it happens to kill or hurt 10,000 people, and there
you would have, let's say, a (b)(2) action for nuisance.

authority to the proposition that if you have a class

(b)(2), why there shouldn't be notice, how those class

given the precedent in the Supreme Court that you can't

6

7

The explanation of that is to be

found in the history of Rule 23 and the version that

existed from 1938 to 1966.

merely a codification of the kind of historic equity class

But I was rather surprised that in such suits

that first person's suit could bind other people who

suffered from the nuisance on issues that were not

litigated.
Now, if, in fact, that did happen under (b)(2)

or this historic practice in equity, I'd like to know why

8

it happened, because it happening without notice would
seem,

(a) very unfair, and (b) contrary to the precedents

of the Court that say you can't take a person's action

I assume from that provision that in a case

comparable to the Mullane situation a district court, if

we were operating under the Federal rules and in Alabama,

since they have virtually the same rules, would say in

summons and complaint in the mail, or --

MR. SLAUGHTER:

You don't

I think that provision of the

10

rule is a very useful admonition and a very cautionary

11

one, and a very valuable tool in the management of class

actions, but I do not think it is mandatory for due

13

process analysis where you have plaintiffs, representative

Not in terms of the economic consequences of the

So long as the Court satisfies itself

MR. SLAUGHTER:

that -- the levy of a tax is totally useless to a local
government if it can be challenged in endless litigation.

Now, admittedly, stare decisis after a certain

MR. SLAUGHTER:

2

I cannot distinguish all, but I

3

can tell you that the very class of case that we're

4

talking about today, cases which need to determine with

5

some degree of finality and reliability State and local

6

government issues do need the possibility of class

7

adjudication, whether it be in the traditional form which

8

I say the Bedingfield case was, or certified as a (b)(1)

9

or (b)(2) class, as the petitioners seek to do in this

10
11

case.
In either case, it would constitute a final

12

litigation of the matter, and would enable government to

13

proceed without the constitutional cloud of uncertainty

14

hanging over its head.

15

In that respect, I think class actions are very

16

useful, though they do conflict with this tradition in a

free society that Justice Scalia was talking about.

preclusion to give the government authority sufficient

2

confidence to go ahead with their project seems to me

3

carrying it a little farther than you really have to.
MR. SLAUGHTER:

4

Well, as I mentioned in our

5

brief, Justice Stevens, we are not going to insist on

6

claim preclusion in this case.

7

argument can be made for issue preclusion on the equal

8

protection case.

I think an adequate

And admittedly -- admittedly, there are a number
10

of cases where, if a matter in question, for example, the

11

proper procedure for a bond issue had not been followed

12

and the prior test case only dealt with the legality of

13

its purpose, then clearly the second case would not be

14

blocked.

15

But in this case, the county, bond attorneys,

16

everyone relied upon the fact that the equal protection

17

argument had been raised in the earlier case, and assuming

18

that it was a class action that had the same preclusive

effect as a (b)(1) class action, it was deemed to be res

some people call collateral estoppel, requires not merely

the issue be raised, but that it be actually litigated,

and decided, and essential to the decision, and it's those

two things, actually litigated and decided and is central

5

to the decision, that you don't have with respect to the

6

equal protection claim.

7

MR. SLAUGHTER:

With all due respect, Your

8

Honor, I think it is present in this case.

First of all,

9

the customary rule with regard to judgments is that if an

10

issue was raised by the litigants, whether or not the

11

issue was sufficient, or whether or not the Court

12

specifically addressed it, if it was consistent with the

13

judgment and a contrary position would have negated the

14

judgment, then the decision of that issue is merged in the

15

judgment.

16

QUESTION:

But that only goes to res judicata.

17

That does not apply in a claim preclusion situation.

18

mean, Justice Ginsburg's very question is,

19

if you are going to insist on the position that they are

20

cut off on an issue which was not, in fact, litigated,

21

even though it may have been raised, then you've got to

22

rest your case on res judicata, not on issue preclusion.

23

MR. SLAUGHTER:

of decision, not -- having nothing to do with res

2

judicata, just what first of all was decided, before we

3

get to whether or not that decision precluded anything,

the proper rule is that the equal protection question was

5

decided in the case.
Now, whether it should then have preclusive

7

effect either on a res judicata or on an issue preclusion

8

basis was a different question.

9

QUESTION:

Right, and that's the reason for

10

Justice Ginsburg's question and my question.

11

saying, as I thought you were saying, that you didn't

12

insist on res judicata, that you were satisfied to rely on

13

issue preclusion, then you lose, it seems to me, on any

14

claim of issue preclusion on the res judicata point,

because it was not, in fact, litigated.

On that point, you are correct,

22

Your Honor.

If we cannot persuade this Court that the

23

appropriate rule of decision was that the equal protection

24

question was, in fact, decided by Bedingfield, then we may

indeed be vulnerable, unless the representational nature

1

of the class action of the suit is sufficient to invoke

2

the broader standard of claim preclusion.

3

QUESTION:

Well, on that, could you go back to

4

Justice Stevens' and Justice O'Connor's question for just

5

a second, because it seemed to me that on -- there are two

6

equal protection claims, I think, that were raised.

7

One was 500,000, and they might have litigated

8

that one, I don't know, but the other one is the licensed

9

professionals versus the other, and that was stated in the

10

claim and then abandoned, all right, I guess, or they

11

never got to it, so think of the second one, all right?
Now, I take it no notice -- is there -- you were

12

13

talking about tradition, the tradition of these class

14

actions.

15

one, but did you find a case which, going back as long as

16

you want in tradition, would say, take, e.g., a nuisance

run by the city that hurts 10,000 people, not a taxpayer

18

action that is a private Attorney General action -- that's

out of this case.

Did you find any case -- because I couldn't find

Did you find any case where the first person to

bring the nuisance suit would bind later people who did

not have notice on an issue that wasn't litigated?

relevant here, and I'm not saying there is or there isn't.

possibility of such a thing falling under (b)(2), and

maybe the appropriate action order thing that Justice

Ginsburg takes care of it, but did you find any such case?

5

MR. SLAUGHTER:

No, I did not, Your Honor, and

6

that is precisely the reason why in the brief I said that

7

perhaps the Alabama supreme court painted too broadly with

8

the claim preclusion brush for purposes of due process,

9

and that it might be more -- a kinder and gentler due

10

process application if, in fact, it were limited to issue

11

preclusion.

12

QUESTION:

And if that were so, then I guess it

13

wasn't just that there was no finding that the

representation was adequate.

that is the fact that there was not even any notice.

MR. SLAUGHTER:

What concerns me more than

Well, Your Honor, with regard to

17

this notice, I can answer nothing, other than usage that

has been sanctioned for many years as a settled practice

meets the requirements of due process, because in fact, if

20

you examine the history of this kind of representational

21

suit in equity, the precursor of Rule 23 between 1938 and

22

1966 and its present operation with regard to (b)(1) and

23

(b) (2) classes, which are the suitable vehicle for this

kind of public issue, notice is not required in order to

First of

Mr. Slaughter, you mentioned that you

7

case is a little shaky on the claim preclusion part, but

8

you say it's solid on issue preclusion, and since you do

9

have a decision of the highest court of your State, is

10

there, in fact, any difference between stare decisis and

11

issue preclusion with respect to these issues, the ones

12

that were actually litigated and decided all the way up

13

the line in Alabama?

14

between those two labels?

15

Is there any significant difference

MR. SLAUGHTER:

Just the necessity of going

16

through the relitigation of this particular case again,

17

Your Honor, and the fact that if someone doesn't like the

18

opinion of the Alabama supreme court in that case, yet

19

another plaintiff may bring the public law equivalent of a

strike suit.

21

QUESTION:

But you can always bring a suit, and

22

in both cases it seems to me the other side would move for

23

summary judgment and one case would say, issue preclusion,

24

and the other case would say, stare decisis.

10

nature that are to be taken into account for stare

decisis.

QUESTION:

May I ask you one question on the

distinction of stare decisis and preclusion?

14

me any case in which a plaintiff was found to be barred by

res judicata, estoppel, whatever it might be, not stare

much on point in that regard, Justice Stevens, because the

10

interest, but the court held that they were precluded from

11

further litigating that question because their legal as

12

opposed to their economic interest was indistinguishable

13

from that of the City of Dallas and others who had

14

litigated the same public question before, and that is a

15

case, I think, that meets your criteria.

16

Now, they had notice, though, in the sense of

17

actual notice, because of all the publicity attending the

18

case, but not necessarily legal notice within the

19

procedural requirements of Rule 23.

20

As I said earlier, I believe that this case is

21

really governed by Hansberry v. Lee, which stood for

22

several very fundamental points.

23

petitioners that it said the States are free, subject to

24

Federal due process, to devise any kind of procedural

25

vehicle for representational suits they desire.

One, I agree with the

Secondly, those representational suits will bind

1
2

the members of the class who are represented.

3

Thirdly, it is a violation of due process if the

4

representative of the class has a conflict of interest or

5

does not adequately represent the members of the class,

6

and that was a specific holding in Hansberry v. Lee, and

7

finally, Hansberry v. Lee stands for the proposition that

8

the question of adequate and fair representation in this

9

kind of suit is a matter for retroactive examination by

10

the courts when res judicata becomes a question.
And in that regard, it is consistent with the

11
12

principle of Rule 23 that the certification of a class

13

does not establish its preclusive effect for the future.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. BAXLEY

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BAXLEY:

20

No question, Bedingfield was not a

21

class.

Nobody ever considered it one, and contrast the

22

lack of notice there with what was deemed not sufficient

23

in Martin v. Wilks, where there, you had the Birmingham

24

Firefighters Association that appeared, these later

25

plaintiffs were members of the association, the court

ordered that notice be published in both Birmingham

2

newspapers for, I think, 30 days or so, they solicited

3

opinions, asked everybody to come in, these organizations

4

represented these people, you had much, much more notice-

5

type in the Martin v. Wilks than you had here, where you

6

had none, zero.

7

Secondly, it could have been a class.

The

8

county, if they had wanted it to barr everything forever,
they could have come in -- the Rules of Civil Procedure

10

were in effect in Alabama for class actions 10 or 12 years

11

before Bedingfield.

12

The county didn't want to do that.

They didn't

13

want to make it a class.

They hoped nobody would ever

14

raise legal protection.

They didn't want to litigate it

15

then, they don't want to litigate it today, they don't wan

16

to litigate it tomorrow, but that's the party that should

17

have made it that way by your dicta, or your ruling of

18

both parties are the ones that best know.

1

And lastly, in the Southwest Airlines case that

20

he mentioned just then, that was a very different

21

situation that the Fifth Circuit ruled in that instance.

22

The attorneys for the parties that were "nonparties" also

23

filed amicus briefs.

24

through the actual first proceeding, there was a lot of

25

different fact situations different in the Southwest
