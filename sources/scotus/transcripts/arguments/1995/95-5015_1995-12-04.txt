ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. VERRILLI:

please the Court:
This case is about the standards that govern a

3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Federal court's decision whether to entertain a first
Federal habeas corpus petition.

4

The issue arises in an anomalous factual

5

context.

The record is clear that petitioner Larry

Lonchar, though found competent, is a deeply disturbed

person with suicidal impulses.

conviction and death sentence in next friend habeas corpus

QUESTION:

Well, are you suggesting that one

23

would have to be mentally ill in order to resist efforts

1

Justice, but in this instance, yes.

2

one that produces and has been documented as producing

3

serious suicidal impulses and that, we think, is the

4

principal reason, and the record shows it's the principal

5

reason that it's led to his resistance of those efforts.

QUESTION:

His mental illness is

Mr. Verrilli, do we take this case on

7

the assumption, as the -- I guess it's the Eleventh

8

Circuit found, that the petitioner is seeking Federal

9

habeas for purposes of delaying his execution and not to

10

12

vindicate any constitutional right he might have?
MR. VERRILLI:
that effect --

assumption?
MR. VERRILLI:

No, Justice O'Connor.

In our --

20

QUESTION:

And why not?

MR. VERRILLI:

In our view, Justice O'Connor,

21

the record shows that the district court found both that

22

Lonchar seeks, genuinely seeks to pursue these claims, and

23

that his motive for doing so is solely to achieve delay.

24

In our view, those are irreconcilable.

25

However, it should not matter as a matter of

1

law, even if the Court does take the case with that

finding unchanged, because our position is that Lonchar's

motivation, subjective motivation for filing a first

Federal habeas petition should be irrelevant as a matter

of law.

case, as it is not in civil litigation generally.

It should not be the subject of inquiry in this

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose, though, that you do

acknowledge that habeas is an equitable remedy.

9

MR. VERRILLI:
QUESTION:

10

We do, Justice O'Connor, yes.

And are we limited to what Rule 9

11

provides in that regard as to delay in filing, or could

12

conceivably equitable considerations allow a Federal court

3

to deny even a first Federal habeas?

4

MR. VERRILLI:

Justice O'Connor, I think there

5

are two separate issues woven together there, and if

6

you'll permit me --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. VERRILLI:

9

Sure.
-- let me to try to separate

them.

20

QUESTION:

Fine.

21

MR. VERRILLI:

The first is the passage of time

22

up to the point in June of

995 when Lonchar's Federal

23

habeas petition, the petition at issue here, was filed.

24

Our view about that is that Rule 9(a) governs the analysis

25

of that issue.

There's a second issue here about Lonchar's

1

2

subjective motive for filing as of June

3

position there is that subjective motive should not be a

subject of inquiry.

of case.

of the Federal courts.

Your Honor, that's a serious

I understand that.

QUESTION:

Well, take it just as a hypothetical,

4

not necessarily this case, but you're saying motive is

5

immaterial.

6

think I've got some good claims here, but I really don't

7

care what the court does, I really just want to make fools

of these judges.

What if a first habeas petitioner says, I

MR. VERRILLI:

I think, Your Honor, if there are

20

substantial claims on the merits, and it's a first

21

petition, that they must be adjudicated.

22

that motive was injected into the inquiry here was because

23

the district judge put Mr. Lonchar on the stand and asked

24

him what his motives were.

proper subject of inquiry.

If there's a verification on record, as there

1

was on this case, signed under penalty of perjury pursuant

3

to Habeas Rule 2, that the petitioner genuinely wishes to

4

pursue the claim for relief, that should be the end of the

matter.
QUESTION:

6

But if the petition on its face shows

7

that it's frivolous and/or malicious, it could be

dismissed.
MR. VERRILLI:

9

Very definitely, Justice

10

Ginsburg.

That's right in the habeas rules.

If there's

11

no substantial claim for relief, the petition may be

12

dismissed on its face, but here there are very substantial

3

claims for relief, and there's no doubt about that, and

when substantial claim for relief is alleged, as it was

Do you think that there's any ground,

other than what's stated in 9(a) and (b) -- let's assume

there's no prejudice to the State in that it can answer

MR. VERRILLI:

There may be a very, very limited

and narrowly circumscribed discretion to do so, Your

Honor.

It is not our position that Rule 9(a) and Rule

However, that discretion in our

QUESTION:

Can you give me a concrete example --

9

MR. VERRILLI:

Well --

10

QUESTION:

-- of what such a case would be?

11

MR. VERRILLI: -- there -- the traditional

12

equitable doctrine of unclean hands is the only additional

13

equitable principle that I think is not already

14

encompassed within 9(a) that might be brought to bear

15

here.

16
17

QUESTION:

Well, is 9(a) an exclusive statement

of the doctrine of laches?

18

MR. VERRILLI:

Our view, Justice Kennedy, is

19

that it is definitely an exclusive statement of the

20

doctrine of laches.

21

of laches as it applied to habeas.

22

repeatedly and most recently in the Brecht v. Abrahamson

23

case that in habeas the only laches recognized are those

24

which prejudice the State's ability to defend the

25

petition.

It codified the common law doctrine

QUESTION:

1

Well, would you take that so far as

2

to cover a case in which the prisoner in effect requested

3

various next friends to file next friend petitions in bad

4

faith, knowing perfectly well that he was competent, and

5

to do so solely for the repeatedly delaying the execution

6

date?

7

Would you say that Rule 9(a) -- and in each

8

case, the State's capacity to defend on the merits, if any

9

of these requests for relief reached the merit stage,

10

would not in any way be compromised.
Would you say, in a case like that, that Rule

11
12

9(a) precluded an equitable consideration of that bad

13

faith that he had participated in?

14

MR. VERRILLI:

No, Justice Souter, and that's

15

why, in response to Justice Ginsburg, I indicated that I

16

thought there was some narrow room for the traditional

17

equitable principle of unclean hands to operate even

18

beyond 9(a).

19

QUESTION:

How is that consistent with your --

20

maybe I didn't understand what you said.

21

consistent with your answer that 9(a) exhausts the concept

22

of laches?

23

MR. VERRILLI:

How is that

Because, Justice Souter, laches

24

is about delay and the consequences of delay.

25

seems to me to be a separate inquiry.

Bad faith

Bad faith --

1

QUESTION:

But suppose the State were to show

2

that the evidence were stale, and it would be more

3

difficult for the State to prevail on retrial.

4

beyond the wording of 9(a) as I understand 9(a), because

5

9(a) talks about the ability to respond to the petition.

That's

6

Let's assume the State can completely respond to

7

the petition on, say, ineffectiveness of counsel, but that

8

the evidence will be very, very stale, and the State will

9

have a much more difficult time prevailing.

10
11
12

3

That's not

part of laches?
MR. VERRILLI:

That's correct, Justice Kennedy.

Indeed, that is precisely the holding of this Court in
986 in Vasquez v. Hillery.

That was exactly the issue,

4

whether that kind of prejudice could be recognized and

5

held against a petitioner in habeas.

6

Court in Vasquez was that it could not, that Congress

7

recognized only laches in the sense of difficulty in

8

defending the petition, that different kind of prejudice

9

was not cognizable in laches as applied in habeas.

20
21

The holding of the

That

was the specific holding of that case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Verrilli, may I go back to the

22

earlier point about the finding that he had taken the

23

action he had solely for purposes of delay.

24

to argue your case for you, but it seems to me there's

25

another point to be made.

I don't want

You tell me if I'm wrong.

1

Usually when we talk about or when we condemn an

2

application as being made solely for delay, the

3

implication is that it really is not made with a belief in

4

the merits asserted, that it is either in bad faith or

5

it's on the verge of bad faith, and that it's explicable

6

only as a device to postpone an execution.

7

In this case, as I understand it, the finding of

8

delay was made on the understanding that he wanted to

9

preserve his life long enough to see a change in the

10

method of execution so that he could donate his vital

11

organs to -- I don't know, to science, or an organ bank,

12

or something or other.

13

classic sense that has been condemned, is it?

14

That isn't delay in sort of the

In other words, a person -- if I want to

15

preserve my life, I can then give it away, or throw it

16

away, or do anything I want to with it if I succeed, and

17

that's what your client wants to do, isn't it?

18

MR. VERRILLI:

Justice Souter, you've put it

19

beautifully.

20

that is at issue with respect to the period from June '95

21

forward has to be analyzed as a question of whether it's

22

unwarranted delay, whether it's delay that would not

23

normally have occurred in the normal course of

24

adjudicating a substantial petition, raising substantial

25

claims with a petitioner who has a good faith belief in

That is exactly our argument, that the delay

the substantiality of his claim, and that's what we

2

have -QUESTION:

3

So you can that in terms of our usual

4

terminology there really isn't any contradiction between

5

the two findings that you've pointed out of the lower

6

court in this case.

7

MR. VERRILLI:
Souter.

9
10

QUESTION:

Mr. Verrilli, I thought a moment ago

you said they were inherently contradictory.
MR. VERRILLI:

11

12

That's precisely right, Justice

If one reads them as I understood

Justice O'Connor to have been reading them I think they

3

are contradictory, but what I tried to suggest is that the

4

two can coexist in the sense that, as the facts here show,

5

a person can have a substantial claim, can have a good

6

faith belief in the substantiality of the claim, and can

7

nonetheless be pursuing it for purposes that are other

8

than the purpose of achieving substantive relief, and

9

that's why we think there just shouldn't be an inquiry on

20

a substantial first Federal habeas petition into that

21

issue.

22

QUESTION:

It's strange that that shouldn't be

23

considered by an equity court when even in civil law, if

24

you pursue a right that is a genuine right, but you pursue

25

it solely for the purpose of harassment, that's

MR. VERRILLI:

Well,

I take it Your Honor is

referring to the tort of abuse of process.

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

5

MR. VERRILLI:

Well,

I think that there are

6

significant differences here.

7

that abuse of process tort in the Hecht case two terms

8

ago,

9

when a civil case is filed for purposes of harassment, but

10

only when there is the equivalent of what would I think in

11

the equity context be considered bad faith, or unclean

12

hands.

13

coercion or extortion through use of the civil process.

14

As Your Honor described

it applies in a very narrow circumstance, not just

It's got to be a very serious effort to achieve

And I would also note, Your Honor,

that with

15

respect to abuse of process, although there is a separate

16

tort for damages,

17

does not forfeit the valid substantive claim.

18

continues to go forward on the merits.

19

it's -- the finding of abuse of process

QUESTION:

That claim

Why is it clear that Rule 9 itself

20

doesn't cover this case?

21

ability to respond is affected if this habeas petition is

22

dumped upon the State at the eleventh hour when it is

23

clear that the State cannot respond in time to go ahead

24

with the scheduled execution?

MR. VERRILLI:

Don't you think the State's

I do not, Your Honor.

First,

the

1

burden is on the State to plead rule 9(a) and to advance

2

it as a reason for dismissal.

3

State did preserve Rule 9(a) for future litigation in this

4

case, but they very clearly and distinctly did not advance

5

it as a reason for dismissal.

6

QUESTION:

They did not do so.

The

I see, and you think that a court of

7

equity cannot even take into account the fact that this

8

would have come under 9(a) anyway in deciding whether the

9

court of equity could decide that habeas corpus won't lie?

10

11
12

13

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, I don't think it would have

come under Rule 9(a) anyway.
QUESTION:

Well, that's a different argument

from the one --

14

MR. VERRILLI:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. VERRILLI:

Yes.

-- you were just making.
It is, but there is a threshold

17

point here of some importance.

18

QUESTION:

I'm asking whether a court can

19

consider whether, had 9(a) been alleged, that wouldn't

20

have sufficed anyway.

21

MR. VERRILLI:

what this Court has said is that

22

the timing of the filing of a petition can be considered.

23

However, the only circumstance in which this Court has

24

indicated that it has decisive weight, or very substantial

25

weight, is in the context of a subsequent petition.

The

1

case that comes to mind is this Court's Gomez case, which

2

was Mr. Harris' case, and it was a section 1983 action

3

after four petitions had been filed.
QUESTION:

4

So you'd say, even with a later

5

petition if the petition comes in, you know, 2 minutes

6

before the execution and the State is supposed to respond

7

and a court consider the State's response and rule on the

8

matter within those 2 minutes, that wouldn't be a

9

violation of Rule 9?
MR. VERRILLI:

10
11

that we think Rule 9 addresses, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

12

13

That's not the kind of prejudice

Well, Rule 9 is -- it must be a very

poorly drawn rule, then.

14

QUESTION:

You say that if the petitioner comes

15

in, say even with a second Federal habeas, 5 minutes

16

before the execution is scheduled, he's entitled to have a

17

complete consideration on the merits even though the

18

district judge cannot immediately digest any part of it?
MR. VERRILLI:

19

With respect to a second Federal

20

habeas, no, Mr. Chief Justice.

We think the rules are

21

quite different there.

22

strongly against review, because of the various doctrines

23

that this Court has announced as a matter of the equitable

24

nature of this remedy over the years, and as a general

25

matter.

The presumption in that context is

QUESTION:

1

But the State has to plead abuse in a

2

second Federal habeas, doesn't it?

3

doesn't automatically get pleaded.

4

MR. VERRILLI:

I mean, it just

That rule is clear, Mr. Chief

5

Justice, and has been clear for years, that the burden is

6

on the State to plead abuse.

7

QUESTION:

Well, if this were -- so the

8

question, it seems to me, is whether we should consider as

9

effectively a second habeas what is technically a first

10

habeas that's been filed after the proceeding has been

11

delayed numerous times, not by this petitioner but by

12

people related to this petitioner, seeking to proceed as

3

next friends.

Why shouldn't I consider that the same

4

thing as a second habeas for purposes of whether Rule 9

5

applies --

6

MR. VERRILLI:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. VERRILLI:

9
20
21

Justice Scalia --

-- in the way I've just suggested?
I think that is the crux of the

case, Justice Scalia, but I think this Court cannot do so,
and there are three reasons for that.
The first is that, as a matter of the statute

22

and Rule 9(b), there is a requirement of a prior

23

determination on the merits of the claims.

24

statutory matter, the condition for treating this as a

25

subsequent petition simply isn't satisfied.

You say that we shouldn't apply 9(a)

17

strictly to the first petition, and granting that,

18

although 9(a) doesn't say anything like that, but even if

19

that is true, why should I consider this to be the first

petition for that purpose when in fact there have been

several others filed on this prisoner's behalf?

MR. VERRILLI:

QUESTION:

Mr. Verrilli, 9(a) could be

applicable to a first petition, could it not?

MR. VERRILLI:

Certainly.

If there had been delay, and as a

6

result the prosecutor was unable to answer a point that he

7

might have answered earlier.

MR. VERRILLI:

QUESTION:

10

So 9(a), it doesn't matter whether

it's the first or the tenth, 9(a) could apply.
MR. VERRILLI:

Certainly, Justice Ginsburg.

That's certainly correct, Justice

Ginsburg, and I didn't mean to suggest anything to the

contrary.

whether there were unjustified -- there was unjustified

delay here, given the prior next friend proceedings.

6

question would require, it seems to me, an inquiry into

7

those next friend proceedings then, because if delay is

unjustified under Rule 9(a) it's got to be in some sense

attributable to the petitioner.

9(a) would apply, but the question would be

All he had to do was walk in and say,
I'm competent.

MR. VERRILLI:

Nothing stopped me.

That's right, Justice Souter, but

in terms of whether those prior proceedings created an

7

unjustified delay, I think we have to look into whether --

8

we have to look into the way those --

9

QUESTION:

Well, I'm prepared -- I think what I

10

meant to suggest by my two questions is, I'm prepared to

11

say that to the extent those prior next friend proceedings

12

dragged things out, I guess there's no evidence that would

13

support the argument that we should attribute them to him

14

as opposed to the next friends, but I'm also suggesting

15

that those next friend petitions really don't necessarily

16

explain the delay, because there could have been 10 next

17

friend petitions going on, and he could still have walked

18

in with his own petition at any time.

19
20
21

MR. VERRILLI:

That's correct if there were some

obligation on his part to do so, and -QUESTION:

Well, the question is why --

22

that's -- I guess that's the question.

Was there an

23

obligation, since we have a rule against delay, and my

24

suggestion is that nothing precluded him from coming in

25

earlier, including the next friend petitions.

MR. VERRILLI:

Your Honor, as I read that

because there had been four prior opportunities to raise

that claim in Federal habeas in the normal course of

events and it was not raised, that this section

the lateness of the filing, the State is unable to present

5

MR. VERRILLI:

Yes, I think so, Justice

O'Connor, and particularly -- and the circumstances of

this case are somewhat anomalous in that respect because

actually because of the next friend proceedings the State

has known since

therefore that sort of surprise issue, though it might be

There's also something about the way in which

gather is established precisely to avoid this problem, so

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The Court is faced today with what is truly not

death row inmate in a timely fashion.

There are many

21

things this case is, but that is exactly what it is not.

22

All we have asked the Court in this case to do

23

is to apply traditional equitable principles in existence

for decades to what is clearly an inequitable conduct on

25

the part of the petitioner in this action.

your chance to bring a State habeas petition, and this is

QUESTION:

And did the State tell the Federal

district court that it was unable to file a response

3

because of the lateness of the filing?

4

MS. WESTMORELAND:

We -- what I pled in the

5

answer, in the motion in the district court was that we

6

were not waiving 9(a), but we did not have information on

7

the merits of the claims at that point in time -- things

8

such as the competency to stand trial claim, and the

9

ineffective assistance of claims due to the timeliness of

10

11

the proceedings involved, yes.
QUESTION:

But did the State explain to the

12

court -- do you think it was clear to the court that it

13

was the State's position that it did not have time to make

14

a response?

15

MS. WESTMORELAND:

Your Honor, I think that was

16

clearly pled in our pleadings with the district court that

17

we were saying we don't have time -- because of the

18

circumstances there's no way we can make a representation

19

about prejudice one way or the other.

20

And now we'll get back to a secondary point on

21

that, is that obviously on certain claims there was no

22

prejudice because they had already been litigated on the

23

merits, and that was the secondary problem we had with

pleading delay as a general principle and pleading 9(a) as

the Court that we couldn't respond to all of the claims

2

because I think we probably could have, although how

3

quickly and how thoroughly I could have done so would have

4

been a different matter.

5

QUESTION:

If you didn't invoke Rule 9 -- I take

6

it you didn't invoke it.

You didn't say we're going to

7

come in and show that we're prejudiced.
So then what you're asking this Court to do is

8

9

to say there's a new ground for denying a habeas petition

10

that no one's ever invoked before, and if there is a good

11

ground, and there may be, I'm not saying there isn't, why

12

isn't that a matter that we would leave to Congress and

13

the rules committees rather than say there's an ill-

14

defined power to make up new grounds, which I guess would

15

work both ways.

16

Sometimes there would be new grounds, never made

17

up before, to deny petitions, and sometimes they would be

not turning to blame or praise for a particular instance.

I'm saying, I take it -- and tell me if I'm wrong -- that

10

you and the Eleventh Circuit have a new ground for denying

forever.

14

Certainly my law

Maybe this kind of thing is good, maybe it

isn't, but the issue before us, I would take it, is

16

whether there is a general power in the Federal courts to

17

create new grounds not found in Barefoot v. Estelle or

18

later cases for either granting or denying petitions.

19

If that's the issue, I guess my first thought

20

would be, why isn't it up to Congress, or later

21

experience, or the rules committees to embody those new

22

kinds of grounds, rather than simply giving a mandate to

23

the lower courts to do whatever they think is nice in the

We'll got a lot of cases where they

statement that by and large we will follow traditional

Your Honor, I think if we had

that is the hypothetical you're proposing, I think our

argument certainly becomes much harder because then you're

a lot closer to what 9(a) is designed to deal with, a true

We would submit to the Court that there should

QUESTION:

11

Well, Ms. Westmoreland, do you take

12

the position that a last minute filing of a first Federal

13

habeas, without all these intervening next friend things,

14

is inherently prejudicial under Rule 9(a)?

15

the position that it fits under 9(a) simply because the

filing is so close to the deadline?

We're not trying to

brother and his sister, the State itself had a

psychiatrist who was concerned about the mental condition

of the person about to be executed, and the defendant kept

saying I'm perfectly healthy, I want to be executed and

all the rest, but the State's genuine doubt led to

precisely the same delay that you had here.
Then they finally made up their mind, yes, he's

He could have said -- gone ahead any

Why is that case different?

MS. WESTMORELAND:

Your Honor, I think the

difference in that case is because again you get back to,

that becomes our fault.

That becomes our fault that it's

action that the State should have taken, and either gone

11

ahead and gotten some litigation to proceed and determine

12

that he was competent, or taken some action to get an

13

execution date set to move the case along.

14

QUESTION:

So you're saying that if everything

15

just remained in status quo from 1990 to 1995, for reasons

16

that the State just didn't decide to execute him promptly

17

enough, you would not deny he could then come in 5 minutes

18

before the execution and get an automatic stay.

19

MS. WESTMORELAND:

I would have some problems

20

with it.

The problem with -- first of all, under State

21

law, he can do that.

22

We would not have any way to bar him from doing that at

23

this point, so I would be precluded from making much of an

24

argument in State court, and we would have a State

25

petition filed.

Under Georgia law he can do that.

Certainly.

He

was free to take the position and free to pursue what he

still says he wants to do, and I think that becomes our

second -- in response to Justice O'Connor's question

8

earlier, our second most important factor in this case is

9

what Mr. Lonchar is trying to do, and what he says he is

10

trying to do, and what both the State court and the

11

district court found as fact he is trying to do.

12

He adopted, and I use the word very loosely, the

allegations of these petitions because he's decided that

4

was the only way he could try to have the method of

on that, in part because the Federal court went off on

another ground, but leaving that aside, until it is

this proceeding, stated a claim, and the answer which

2

comes, I guess, out of the circuit, and what you're saying

3

is, that shouldn't matter, because he wants to use his

4

relief for an improper purpose, and the improper purpose

5

is to live long enough to donate his organs to science,

6

and my question to you is, if he is entitled to relief,

7

which we have to assume at this point he is, why is he not

8

entitled to use the life or the period of life that he

9

gains by it for whatever purpose he chooses?
MS. WESTMORELAND:

10

If Mr. Lonchar were saying

11

that I want my conviction and sentence reversed, and in

12

that time period we're going to do what we can about the

13

method of execution, then that does undercut that aspect

14

of our argument, but that's not what he's doing in this

15

case.

16

In spite of the fact that the petition has

17

claims in it which are not subject to dismissal, Mr.

18

Lonchar's stated intent, and the relief he seeks, he does

19

not seek to have his conviction and sentence reversed.

20

That's not the relief he's seeking.

21

point --

22

QUESTION:

We're back to the

Okay, then it ought to be thrown out

23

because he is not seeking relief upon which habeas corpus

24

can grant relief, but that's a separate issue, isn't it?

25

MS. WESTMORELAND:

It -- there's two different

1

issues, and that's a different one, yes, but it's

2

certainly an issue.

3

QUESTION:

Okay.

But we've got to assume that

4

that issue is not before us right now.

5

make that assumption, what's the answer to my question

6

that he ought to be entitled to use whatever life he gets

7

for whatever purpose he wants to use it?

8

answer to that?

9

MS. WESTMORELAND:

Now, why -- if we

What's the

Your Honor, if you get past

10

that -- if you take that assumption, and you go past that

11

point, then what he wants to do with his life is not

12

necessarily the factor any more.

Then we're back to

13

looking at equitable principles.

We're looking at what

14

has gone on over the past 6 years in this case to

15

determine -- we're back to looking at equity, and why

16

equity allows the district court --

17

QUESTION:

And that then gets us solely to the

18

matter of delay, and you have said that even under Georgia

19

law he could have delayed up until 5 minutes and that

20

would not disentitle him on equitable principles under

21

Georgia law to relief.

22

MS. WESTMORELAND:

23

QUESTION:

Alone.

Ms. Westmoreland, I thought you were

24

not willing to accept that assumption.

25

MS. WESTMORELAND:

I thought what --

I'm not, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

1

Yes, I thought not.

I thought that

2

your position is, yes, we're not entitled to a dismissal.

3

That's been ruled on, and it states a claim on its face,

4

but nonetheless, for equitable purposes you can consider

5

the purpose for which he is seeking relief as a factor in

6

the equitable judgment.

7

MS. WESTMORELAND:

8

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

It's the same factor that could be

9

used for a dismissal of the complaint, but merely because

10

you can't dismiss the complaint doesn't mean you that you

11

cannot consider it as an equitable factor.
MS. WESTMORELAND:

12

13

I think that's absolutely our

point.

14

QUESTION:

Is that normally an equity, that -- I

15

mean, if I think that somebody is sitting on my piece of

16

property, and I get an injunction to get rid of them, and

17

I'm legally entitled to the injunction, does it matter if

18

I want to get rid of him because I hate him, rather than I

19

couldn't care less whether he's actually on the property?

20

I mean, I've just never seen that in equity, but

21

maybe it is, I don't -- that the motive matters as opposed

22

to whether you're legally entitled to get rid of this

23

person or not get rid of him.

24

like him, you don't like him, is there some equitable

25

principle?

What matters, whether you

MS. WESTMORELAND:

1

Your Honor, I think that

2

equitable principles -- and again, we get back to

3

separating one at a time.

4

motivation in your hypothetical, then no, that alone does

5

not figure into it.

If you look strictly at

But can you factor all of these aspects

6

7

together?

8

his stated purpose, the stated relief he seeks, his

9

failure to participate in the next friend actions, factor

10
11

Can you factor into the equation in this case

all of these things together -QUESTION:

Yes, but I take it his purpose, he

12

says, look, I'm legally entitled not to be executed

13

because there were legal mistakes made in my trial in

14

earlier proceedings.

15

doesn't want to be executed is because he wants to live

16

forever, or because he feels that he'd like to use the

17

last few years left to him to make certain his organs are

18

donated to help humanity?

19

Does it matter if the reason he

MS. WESTMORELAND:

What's the difference?
I think it certainly matters,

20

Your Honor, when what he says is, I'm not interested in

21

getting my death sentence or my conviction reversed.

22

want to be executed.

23

I'd be happy to be executed this afternoon.

the equities.

2

but isn't there also a large concern that there shouldn't

3

be unevenness?

4

chancellor may fit one way when we're talking about

5

distribution of property, it may fit another way when

6

we're talking about life or death.

7

It's true habeas is an equitable remedy,

Equity discretion for the individual

MS. WESTMORELAND:

Your Honor, I think there's

8

certainly a concern about the evenhanded distribution of

9

justice, if you will.

10

12

QUESTION:

Isn't that why rules are important,

so that everybody will do it the same way?
MS. WESTMORELAND:

Rules are certainly

3

fundamentally important, Your Honor.

4

have in this case is we have a scenario never envisioned

5

by Congress, on which Congress simply has never had the

6

occasion to need to enact a rule.

7

history has never felt constrained to refuse to look at an

8

equitable principle simply because Congress has not acted.

QUESTION:

The problem that we

This Court in its

Well, there's a lot of stretch left

20

in Rule 9 anyway, isn't there, 9(b), for example, if the

21

judge finds that the failure of the petition constituted

22

an abuse of the writ?

23

to what the judge may consider to be abuse of the writ,

24

isn't that right?

25

There's a lot of leeway allowed as

That's correct, Your Honor,

1

and I think this Court has made it quite clear in its

2

abuse-of-the-writ cases that -- we're not saying it's

3

limited to any specific little litany of factors.

QUESTION:

To get into that box, though, it has

to be a successive petition.
MS. WESTMORELAND:

For 9(b), it does.

9(b)

7

specifies successive petitions, that's correct, but there

8

are other --

9

QUESTION:

May I go back to Justice Ginsburg's

10

earlier question, and that is, if this case, given the

11

importance that we all agree a -- some kind of a regime of

12

general rules has, isn't the very fact that this case is

13

so unusual, perhaps it is truly unique, a good reason not

14

to use this case as the occasion to fashion a new rule

15

which in fact is broader than the case?

16

MS. WESTMORELAND:

Your Honor, one of the

17

reasons that we're not asking for a new rule is because I

18

think the old rules of equity apply to this case.

19

the problem with --

situation under circumstances which equity courts have

1

MS. WESTMORELAND:

2

QUESTION:

No.

And isn't that a good reason not to

3

use this as the springboard for a new line of equity-

4

jurisprudence?
MS. WESTMORELAND:

5

Your Honor, if we were asking

6

the Court to do just that and to engage in an entire new

7

line of lawmaking or decisionmaking, then I think this

8

case presents certain factual problems that make it more

9

difficult to engage in general rulemaking, because it's

10

not the general case, but we're not asking the Court to go

11

off making new broad-ranging rules because we don't --

12

under the circumstances of the case, we simply don't need

13

them.

14

Yes, this case presents a classic example of we

15

got two different last minute petitions being filed, two

16

different stays of executions at the very last minute,

17

which could have come up certainly much earlier in the

18

proceedings.

It does lend itself to that analysis.
