ORAL ARGUMENT OF NATHAN LEWIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. LEWIN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case concerns the validity of a Florida

12

statute enacted in 1974 that flatly prohibits financial

13

institutions such as banks, including national banks, from

14

selling life and fire insurance.

15

The case is here on certiorari to the Eleventh

16

Circuit, which upheld the Florida law on the remarkable

17

proposition that a law that prohibits banks from selling

18

life insurance is, within the meaning of the McCarran-

19

Ferguson Act, a law that regulates the business of

20

insurance, while a 1916 Federal law that explicitly does

21

the contrary and authorizes national banks to sell life

22

insurance is not, within the meaning of the very same

23

McCarran-Ferguson Act, a law that specifically relates to

24

the business of insurance.

25

The statement of that proposition is, we submit,

its own refutation.

2

engaging in the business of being an insurance agent is,

3

we believe, not a bona fide regulation of the business of

4

insurance, but if.it is, then its converse, the 1916

5

Federal law that authorizes national banks to do precisely

6

what the Florida law prohibits -- that is, to sell life

7

insurance through licensed agents -- must be a law that

8

specifically relates to the business of insurance.

9

Flatly prohibiting all banks from

Now, that language that I've been referring

10

to - - regulates the business of insurance or relates to

11

the business of insurance - - grows out of the two pronged

12

test of validity prescribed by the McCarran-Ferguson Act

13

whenever an act of Congress conflicts with any law enacted

14

by any State.

The --

QUESTION:

Mr. Lewin, I assume that the Florida

16

courts and the --or the Eleventh Circuit's view of the

17

matter is that the Florida statute is a statute that

18

governs insurance.

19

statute is a statute that's about banks.

20

says banks can do is sell insurance, but I think what the

21

Eleventh Circuit says is that doesn't specifically relate

22

to insurance within the meaning of the statute, because

23

the provision is about banks.

24

MR. LEWIN:

25

It's about insurance.

QUESTION:

2

MR. LEWIN:

Right.
-- the section, and it says that the

3

State law, in order to even satisfy the first of these two

4

hurdles, has to have as its purpose regulating the

5

business of insurance.

6

The broader term is the second term.

The second

7

term speaks about relates to the business of insurance.

8

It appears to us, certainly, you can't, even -- even if a

9

statute speaks about banks, it also relates to insurance

10

if it says, as the 1916 law does, specifically that banks

11

may sell insurance policies, if --

12

QUESTION:

I agree with you that any legislation

13

that regulates insurance relates to insurance, but does

14

any legislation that regulates insurance specifically

15

relate to insurance?

16

MR. LEWIN:

17

QUESTION:

It does, Justice -You could regulate it - - can't you

18

regulate insurance in passing?

19

argument made here, that really they -- the Federal

20

legislation may - - you may even say it regulated

21

insurance, but it did it only in passing, not

22

specifically.

23

MR. LEWIN:

I mean, that's the

But the word specifically, we

24

submit, means to distinguish between the statutes that

25

would include insurance within some broader statutory

1

term, commercial services, various kind -- but certainly a

2

statute specifically relates to insurance when the word

3

insurance appears in that statute five times.

4

If the Court will look at section 92, which

5

appears at la and.2a of the appendix to our brief, life --

6

fire -- life or other insurance is specified in there, and

7

the word insurance appears explicitly in that statute on

8

five different occasions.

9

QUESTION:

Nothing could be more --

Mr. Lewin, even so, why can't one

10

read these two provisions, the State and Federal, as

11

compatible, as not in conflict?

12

The Federal law may specifically relate to

13

insurance, but why not -- as one of your opponents argued,

14

why not read the Federal law as simply giving the banks

15

permission to enter this line of business which it

16

couldn't enter without Federal permission, just giving it

17

Federal permission, yet subject to whatever regulation the

18

State may choose to put on it?

19

MR. LEWIN:

Justice Ginsburg_, there are several

20

answers, I think, to that question.

First of all, because

21

the statute does not specifically say that.

22

how it could say, as our adversaries say, national banks

23

are simply empowered to engage in the business of selling

24

insurance if the State permits them to do so.

25

statute, section 92, submits the national bank only to the

Congress knew

The

1

authority of the Comptroller of the Currency.

2

insurance company whose policies are being sold has to be

3

a company which is authorized by the State authorities.

4

It does not say that the national bank has to be

5

authorized by the State authorities, and the Congress that

6

considered and enacted section 92, the very same Congress,

7

also considered the question of branch banking.
When it did so, and this appears I think more

8

9

It says the

extensively in an amicus brief that's filed by a whole

10

group of banking, local State banking associations, the

11

Court can see, I think, at page 13 of that brief where

12

Congress put into the branch banking provisions that it

13

was considering language which would have subjected the

14

national banks to the authority of the State before they

15

could open branch banks.

16

section 92, so our first point is that the statutory

17

language argues against that reading.

18

Congress didn't do that with

Our second point is that the Comptroller of the

19

Currency constant interpretation argues against that

20

reading.

21

the one who is authorized to administer this authority

22

under section 92.. This Court very recently in its VALIC

23

decision pointed out how the Court gave deference to the

Comptroller of the Currency, and the Comptroller of the

25

Currency since the enactment of this law has always read

it as meaning that the national banks have authority

2

independently of what the State may or may not do.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Lewin --

4

QUESTION:

That's what he --

5

QUESTION:

-- when you say the Comptroller of

6

the Currency is the regulator, you don't mean to say, do

7

you, that the selling of insurance by the bank --

8

MR. LEWIN:

9

QUESTION:

10

No.
-- couldn't be regulated by Florida?

MR. LEWIN:

Absolutely not, Justice Ginsburg.

11

We agree that the qualifications of the agents who are

12

selling is subject to all the State laws.

13

licensure laws which apply to all insurance agents would

14

apply to those who would sell it on behalf of the banks,

15

and we're not arguing that the entire State licensure

16

system is preempted or replaced.

17

The State

Our adversaries are trying to make the Court

18

believe that maybe that's the consequence of our position.

19

It is not at all.

20

section 92 are permitted to sell insurance, and then

21

subject to the regulation, of the kind of regulation that

22

Congress had in mind when it enacted McCarran-Ferguson.

23

What we are saying is, banks under

It knew that prior to the South-Eastern

24

Underwriters case there was a whole web of regulation on

the part of the States of the business of insurance,

1

including the licensure of agents, and consequently when

2

it enacted McCarran-Ferguson it maintained that system of

3

regulation in place, but when a State comes in after the

4

fact and for motives that are not the protection of

5

policyholders with regard to the integrity or the ability

6

of insurance agents, but which are anticompetitive

7

motives, and we think that clearly emerges from this, the

8

history of this statute as well --

9

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Lewin, the other side

10

argues that there is a public motive, that you don't want

11

the banks too closely tied up with the insurance in

12

connection with a loan.

13

MR. LEWIN:

We understand that that is what they

14

are saying.

15

the preamble that the - - this statute had when it was

16

first put in, and there is no other suggestion in the

17

legislative history that there was a motive other than the

18

motives which the preamble set out, but --

19

That is - - first of all, that is contrary to

QUESTION:

That motive wouldn't explain allowing

20

banks that are not part of bank holding companies to do

it, would it?

doesn't prohibit all banks.

23

As I understand the Florida statute, it

MR. LEWlN:

It does not prohibit banks that are

24

in communities of less than 5,000 that are not subsidiary

25

to bank holding companies.

QUESTION:

And the rationale of stopping banks,

2

the procompetitive rationale of preventing banks from

3

getting all of the business when they make the real estate

loan, that makes no -- no reason to limit it to nonbank

That distinction would

11

QUESTION:

The statute doesn't cover credit life

12

either, does it?

13

MR. LEWIN:

14

QUESTION:

No, it does not.
So that would be, I suppose, the

15

field in which you would assume the banks would be most

16

overbearing in trying to exercise their authority, and yet

17

that's exempted.

18

MR. LEWIN:

It's true there are really a number

19

of very good rational arguments that demonstrate that this

is not the purpose.

not the purpose of this statute.

drawn, the legislative history, the fact that the statute

23

invokes the Bank Holding Company Act.

we're doing this because of the authority we have under

McCarran-Ferguson to regulate insurance.

QUESTION:

What do you say to the argument, the

2

kind of subsidiary argument, to be sure, but what do you

3

say to the argument that because the effect is to regulate

4

what your opponents describe as the point of sale of the

5

insurance, that therefore you simply must impute a purpose

6

to regulate insurance to that effect, and therefore the

7

purpose prong of the statute is satisfied?

8

9

MR. LEWIN:

Well, we think that goes too far.

It would -- there's almost any kind of law that would

10

affect insurance could be dressed up or could be explained

11

after the fact in that way.

Indeed --

-- this Court's opinions -As a distinction it would read the

intent requirement out, you're saying.
MR. LEWIN:

We think it would not -- it would

18

not be an effective and useful distinction, and indeed,

19

this Court's opinions in Pireno and in -- in the prior

20

cases, where the Court was considering these, the Court

21

rejected the argument that simply looking to either the

22

solvency of the insurance company, whether it would

ultimately be solvent, whether it would -- and its impact

on policyholders v&as a sufficient basis for saying that

That would have to have gone the

QUESTION:

5

MR. LEWIN:

--of the business of insurance.
Yes.
And the Pireno case does lay down

6

three standards that make it clear that what we're dealing

7

with is really the relationship between the insurer and

8

the policyholder.

9

This is not a statute that deals with the

10

regulation of insurance within the meaning of the Pireno

11

definitions.

12

which is this Court's most recent examination of this

13

statute, and indeed one of only two, the Court said in

14

Fabe that the only time it has previously looked at this

15

language specifically about the regulation of insurance

16

was in the National Securities case, which involved the

17

application of the securities laws to insurance companies

18

and their ability to deal with potential stockholders and

19

that regulation.

And this Court has said in the Fabe case,

But the Court said in Fabe also that the key

20
21

test, the standard as to whether this was regulation of

22

the business of insurance, turned upon whether it dealt

23

with the relationship between the insurance company and

24

the policyholders, the actual implementation of that

25

policy.

2

But not a regulation that says you

3

MR. LEWIN:

That would apply.

Let me say first,

4

Justice Scalia, that only applies to the first prong, or

5

the first hurdle.

6

if a State in fact had a legislative record that indicated

7

that banks in some way were deceiving insurance customers

that it could not‘enact a statute that would reach that

kind of practice even if what they did is, they did it in

It may be, and I'm not questioning that

terms of reaching banks, but that would not affect the

question of whether section 92 goes beyond that and

specifically relates to the business of insurance.

13

QUESTION:

Well, maybe it wouldn't, but I am

14

much less inclined to come out the way you would like me

to with regard to the question of whether section 92

MR. LEWIN:

1

I think because in this case, Mr.

Chief Justice, Congress has said so.

business of insurance.

QUESTION:

Congress has said,

MR. LEWIN:

Well, I think when Congress says

purpose, and has used that in the statute, then I think

10

for purposes of that hurdle, the Court does have to look

at purpose.
QUESTION:

12

Why can't there just be a presumption

13

that if there appears to be a purpose on the face of the

14

statute, that probably was what Congress talked about?

15

MR. LEWIN:

That's a possible legal rule,

16

Mr. Chief Justice, but I'm saying nonetheless the Court

17

has to deal with the fact that the statute says, purpose,

18

and in some way it has to devine what the purpose was in

enacting the statute.

prongs that this statute - - two hurdles that this Florida

of regulating the business of insurance, and 2) the

Federal statute with which it conflicts has to be one that

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

MR. BRESS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In section 92 of title 12, Congress authorized

22

national banks located in small towns to serve as

23

insurance agents.

24

an additional source of revenue to supplement the income

25

that they earn in more traditional banking activities.

Section 92 enables those banks to earn

In

1

the Comptroller's view, national banks located in small

2

towns need to earn that sort of supplemental fee-based

3

income to remain competitive with other financial

4

institution lenders.
To the extent that Florida's antiaffiliation law

5
6

prohibits national banks from selling insurance in small

7

towns, it frustrates Congress' intentions and impairs the

8

efficiency with which the national banks in small towns

9

can carry on their statutory functions.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Bress, is the term, relates to

11

2

QUESTION:

And get perhaps closer to this act.

3

MR. BRESS:

4

If this^statute merely said, relates to, then

5

McCarran-Ferguson would arguably accept any Federal law

6

that has any connection with interstate commerce.

7

Congress did not intend that broader scope.

8

added the modifier, specifically, to make clear that State

9

insurance law would be preempted only when Congress has

Certainly.

Congress

10

referred to, focused on, or acted specifically with

11

reference to the business of insurance.

12

Therefore, if section 92, which is at issue

13

here, merely authorized national banks to engage in

14

commerce, that statute would not specifically relate to

15

the business of insurance.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Bress, in Fabe, this Court came

17

pretty close to requiring a sort of clear statement rule

18

for a law that relates to insurance by the Federal

19

Government.

20

MR. BRESS:

Your Honor, in its -- I agree, in

21

its description of that prong of the McCarran-Ferguson

22

test, this Court stated that it was a plain statement rule

23

and used language to that effect.

24

however, of Fabe, and this Court has reminded us often --

clear statement requirement, do you think this section 92

2

meets it here?

3

MR. BRESS:

Well, I guess that would depend what

4

clear statement meant.

5

Congress saying, not only can banks do this but we also

6

affirmatively preempt State law to the contrary, no, this

7

wouldn't pass it, but the language that Congress actually

used here, specifically relates to, does not require that

sort of statement.

If the clear statement had to be

Congress, when it was passing the McCarran-

Ferguson Act, had in the bill that originally went to the

But the sentence Justice O'Connor

22

MR. BRESS:

Are we going to have to ignore that

You may well, Your Honor.

I believe

that that language did not accurately describe the text of

the statute as it actually reads.

Senator Ferguson has been quoted as taking, we would

QUESTION:

MR. BRESS:

In almost all cases you would want

to find the word insurance, or at least other words that
meant insurance, in the statute itself, yes.

What kind of other words do you - -

you mean reference to specific policies, things like that?

Okay.

I think that

But the so many words have got to be

MR. BRESS:

QUESTION:

That's right.
Mr. Bress, can you help us out on

what -- if section 92 is read the way you wish, what

kind -- you know, you could say the bank could sell

insurance, period, and the State can't stop it from

the State can continue to regulate that sale of insurance,

QUESTION:

You say,

That's been the Comptroller's

MR. BRESS:

Well, a statement of lenders can't

sell insurance would, in our view, conflict with section

saying -- I don't understand how you draw that line.

3

MR. BRESS:

Your Honor, you may well want to --

4

States may well want to regulate lots of things that banks

5

are, but to the degree that States purport to prohibit

6

banks, because they are those things, because the Federal

7

legislation has made banks those things, from selling

8

insurance, you'd have a conflict with Federal law.

9

QUESTION:

So the State can't regulate anything

10

that is a power -- or cannot exclude from insurance agency

11

any power that is a power accorded to banks by Federal

12

law.

13

MR. BRESS:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. BRESS:

Your Honor, I don't think I - Lending money, so forth.
I think if the State attempted to

16

pick out a power that the Federal Government has given to

17

banks and that banks possess, and use that as a

18

characteristic for excluding those entities for insurance,

19

it would be preempted by Federal law.
QUESTION:

20

But there's a narrower interpretation

other than just, banks can't -- lenders can't sell

That would be a more difficult

The Comptroller General hasn't spoken

MR. BRESS:

The Comptroller has not spoken to

I'd like to speak to the preemption issue a bit more
«

13

There's been an argument by Respondent that

14

the -- there's a presumption against preemption, and while

15

that's ordinarily true when you've got Federal and State

16

laws that deal with private persons, here you've got an

17

attempt by a State to regulate a Federal instrumentality.

18

And as this Court noted in Franklin National

19

Bank, the Federal Government is a rival chartering

20

authority, and when the States presume to control the

21

instrumentalities of the Federal Government, this Court

22

has stated over and over that that sort of control can

23

only be exercised'with Congress' consent, and in Franklin

24

National Bank, this Court made a point of pointing out

25

various statutes in which Congress has expressly said,

1

national banks may do this only if State banks may as well

2

do it, or national banks may do it subject to State

3

authority.

4

In Franklin National Bank, it was critical that

5

that statute, which used language like this statute, may

6

language, did not have that sort of State authorization.

7

This case really should come out no differently than

8

Franklin National Bank in that regard.

*

The same point was made, by the way, by the

9
10

Court in the Easton case as well as in the Fellows case.

11

Getting back to the specifically relates point

12

to a moment, I'd like to reiterate that this statute not

13

only mentions insurance but mentions it five times.

14

specifies which types of bank, what banks may sell

15

insurance, what companies they may sell insurance for, it

16

says who can put out the rules and regulations for

17

insurance, and it has two express limitations on the sale

18

of insurance.

very specifically on insurance when it enacted section 92,

and that the statute is one that relates specifically to

insurance.

MR. BRESS:

2

The Federal Government has not

actually regulated the selling of insurance by national

banks, and the absence of regulation by the Federal

Government would mean that there would be no conflict with

ordinary State rules regulating it.

QUESTION:

The other thing is --

But I thought it was your position a

8

moment ago that it took actual congressional consent for

the State to regulate a federally chartered institution,

10

not just lack of conflict.
MR. BRESS:

11

Your Honor, I may have spoken too

12

broadly.

It does require consent, but this Court has

13

assumed a background of consent to general State laws.

For example, State laws regarding contracts, collection of

2

of the business of insurance is in the public interest.

3

Congress' intent to throw the weight of its power behind

4

State regulation is clearly expressed in the McCarran-

5

Ferguson Act.

6

The Department of Insurance's position is that

7

once a State law is established to regulate the business

8

of insurance by protecting policyholders, that State law

o

is preempted by a Federal law only if the Federal law is a

10

clear statement that Congress intended for the State's

regulation of the business of insurance to be displaced.

anything in the Federal income tax law that refers

I'm helping -- in our State in Florida we think

5

it's really nice, particularly towns under 5,000, where,

you know, they have a tough time, and they really don't

of the policy, keeping the money there available for the

MR. SUMNER:

Well, the core of the business of

19

insurance goes to the issues of enforceability, the

20

reliability, and I think also the suitability of an

21

insurance contract, so if you're regulating the business

22

of insurance, you are regulating the policyholder's

protection over a current promise, a current contract for

a future promise.

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
All right.

Well then, I don't see

7

how you fit within it, because how do you fit within it?

8

Why isn't this case more like the merger case?

9

between two insurance companies aren't protected.

Mergers
This

10

has to do with whether a bank holding company could own an

11

insurance company which, after all, a small bank could

12

own.

13

I mean, which bank owns -- which kind of a bank?

14

Some banks can own.

15

National banks can't.

16

the difference between who can own the insurance agent, a

17

big bank or a little bank, and the question of mergers and

banks, both being4quite different from regulating the

terms of a contract?

MR. SUMNER:

Small banks can own insurance agents.
All right, under this test, what's

Okay, let's basically start with

21

the fundamentals of the regulation of the business of

22

insurance and the insurer-policyholder relationship.

23

insurer-policyholder relationship is consummated in an

24

insurance contract.

That insurance contract needs to be

1

fairly and suitably entered into.
The individual who is responsible for bringing

2

3

those parties together and creating an enforceable,

4

reliable, and suitable insurance contract is the insurance

5

agent.

6

role of the insurance agent in that insurance transaction,

7

in making sure you have an enforceable, reliable, and

8

suitable insurance contract, part of the insurance policy,

9

insurer-policyholder relationship?

10
11

Therefore, I think the first question is, is the

I think the answer to

that definitely is yes.
The question then becomes, if the insurance

12

agent is an integral player in making sure that the

13

insurer-policyholder relationship occurs, then if the

14

Florida legislature has found that the interjection of a

15

national bank into the role of the agent in that insurer-

16

policyholder relationship creates the dangers of coercion,

17

unfair trade practices, and undue concentration of

18

resources, whether or not that interjection of those

19

perils into the insurer-policyholder relationship is a

20

legitimate regulation of the business of insurance.

21

There may be issues raised by the petitioner as

22

to the wisdom of whether there was some other way of

23

handling those perils, but if you look at the Michael M.

24

case, the question is if the legislature has identified a
<

25

particular method of addressing perils with regard to the
30

1

protection of policyholders, then normally the Court gives

2

great deference to the State's judgment, which has been

3

ratified by the State courts, as to the manner in which

4

that particular danger will be addressed.

5

The petitioner repeatedly asserts that the

6

dangers that have been asserted are disingenuous.

There

7

is no record evidence, other than the preamble, which

8

would in any way Suggest that the State court cases,

9

Production Credit and Glendale, which are cited on pages

10

20 and 21 of the Department of Insurance brief, are not

11

the most accurate articulation of the purposes of this

12

law, and I would point out that the law was enacted in

13

1974.

14

The Production case in 1978 indicated on page 20

15

that the legislature has found in Florida that there is

16

inherent potential for abuse in banks engaging in

insurance agent activities.

Okay, if you want to talk about --

22

I think one of the issues is, why is there a prohibition

23

against bank holding companies and not all banks in

24

allowing the small town bank to sell insurance in Florida?

25

I believe that goes most directly to the issue of undue

1

concentration of resources.
The argument which explains that particular

2

3

element of the danger is that if a bank holding company is

4

entitled, as the Comptroller has allowed, through a branch

5

in a small town, to market in any geographical area, then

6

that bank holding company can concentrate its entire

7

marketing force into that one location and essentially use

8

it as a venue to engage in the insurance business.

9

QUESTION:

If that is the object why did they

>

10

accept credit life?
MR. SUMNER:

11

Well, first of all, I think that in

12

the legislature's judgment I believe there was a sense

13

that with regard to credit life three was more of a nexus

14

between the bank's interest in protecting loans and

15

protecting credit than there was in the sale of other

16

insurance.

17

QUESTION:

That -- maybe I don't understand.

18

That, it would seem to me, would increase the likelihood

19

that the bank would in fact unduly use its power to

20

influence the issue of, the issuance of this insurance.

21

If the bank wants to be insured against

22

anything, it wants to be insured against losing its loan

23

return because of debt, so I should suppose the bank's

24

temptation would be very high there.

25

MR. SUMMER:

Why was it accepted?

judgment, but again -QUESTION:

2

No, but if -- but it's a legislative

3

judgment that seems to me to be at odds with the rationale

4

that you were saying was the legislative purpose within

5

the meaning of the statute.
MR. SUMNER:

6

Oh, I think it is at odds.

If you

7

look at the Department of Insurance brief at page 5, in

8

the record there's testimony that as the exception to
«

9

626.988, that in Florida the credit line has become an

10

area where reverse competition has occurred, and that

11

because of that reverse competition, where the competition

12

is not for purposes of gaining customers but to gain

13

market share, that the commission levels in those products

14

have gone to as much as 80 percent.

15

So it very well may be that the credit line, by

16

the record testimony, is an example of the fact that

17

perhaps the legislature should have made another judgment

18

with regard to that particular line of business.

19

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose you could say that no

20

statute pursues its objectives at all costs, and the

21

legislature just said there's such a overwhelming reason

22

why a bank would want to sell its own insurance in these

23

situations that although the same risks might exist, we

24

won't extend our prohibition that far.

25

suppose.

That's possible, I

MR. SUMNER:

Yes, sir, and I believe that -- one

2

other thing I would want to point out is one of the

3

dangers which is identified which is somewhat overlooked,

4

and which has been found in Florida, is the issue of

5

unfair trade practices.

6

One of the issues that's very important is that

7

with the sale of insurance products, that there is the

8

peril that the insurance-buying person will become

9

deceived as to what is a bank product and what is an

10

insurance product, so I think that more than just the

11

problem of tying it to a loan, there's the problem of in

12

essence a deception in consumers being misled.

13

So I think more than just the problem of tying

14

it to a loan, there's the problem of in essence a

15

deception and consumers being misled.

16

QUESTION:

Suppose I don't look at the

17

legislative history of any of this and think, well, gee,

18

to a person looking at this statute, the only purpose I

19

can imagine it would have is that it wants to help the

20

little banks make more money by preventing the competition

21

from the big banks, and it wants to raise the prices to

22

the insurers who are buying the policies, and as a result,

23

everybody is more secure.

25

So it's a good insurance purpose -- make
everybody more secure, they make more money, there's less

Ms. Kappler, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN M. KAPPLER

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTS

5
6

7

MS. KAPPLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Eleventh Circuit ruled on the basis of

8

McCarran and petitioner and the Solicitor General's Office

9

has stressed in particular the McCarran issue, but this

10

Court need not reach the McCarran question, because even

11

under traditional preemption there is no -- traditional

12

preemption doctrine there is no preemption here, and the

13

reason is simple.

14

A State law that treats State chartered banks

15

and nationally chartered banks evenhandedly, which is what

16

626.988 does, does not interfere with the objectives of

17

Congress in enacting section 92 which, as stated by the

18

Solicitor General's Office here today, was to enable

19

small, nationally chartered banks to have additional

20

revenue in order to enable them to compete with State

21

chartered banks - -

22

QUESTION:

Well, it's not quite that easy.

23

Solicitor General did not, I think, concede or suggest

24

that this was kind of an equal protection clause for

25

competition.

The object which the Solicitor General

The

1

argues is behind the section 92 is indeed a competitive

2

object, but his argument is that one way to provide that

3

competition is to allow them to sell the insurance,

4

period.

5

simply to put them on an equal footing in the sale of

6

insurance with State banks.

7

He didn't concede, it seems to me, that it was

MS. KAPPLER:

Perhaps I overstated it.

I

8

certainly didn't mean to say he's conceding that there's

9

preemption here, or there's no preemption.

10
11

He certainly

is not.
QUESTION:

No, but he wasn't conceding that

12

there was -- there was kind of, as I put it, an equal

13

protection clause here for State and Federal banks, and in

14

fact the argument is, for which there has been I think

15

some evidence adduced here in the courtroom, that in fact

16

the point of the statute was to allow them to get into the

17

insurance business so that they could earn money and,

18

generally speaking, be more competitive against their

19

State rivals, and it seems to me that's what you've got to

20

refute here.

21

MS. KAPPLER:

Your Honor, the legislative

22

history, and although it is very scant here, there is one

23

letter from the Comptroller who drafted this legislation

24

and proposed it to the Congress, who accepted that

25

proposal as written and in fact used this letter as

9

MS. KAPPLER:

Your Honor, in fact the letter

10

makes absolutely clear that what the Comptroller was

worried about was * allowing them to get additional revenue,

12

but additional revenue in order to enable them to compete

13

with State-chartered banks who had these very powers, Your

14

Honor.

15

QUESTION:

Well, sure, if they go out of

16

business they can't compete, but I mean, the argument was,

17

they need the additional revenue because, given the sort

18

of piddling deposits that they tend to get in these little

19

towns, they just can't earn enough money to stay in

20

business if they haven't got some other revenue source.

21

Wasn't that basically the argument?

it comes to banking powers, the incidental powers, of

the exercise of those nonbanking powers, the principle is

what Congress was trying to do was regulate the business

20

of insurance, not just insurance.

I mean, petitioner would -- constantly uses the

word insurance as if that were sufficient.

MS. KAPPLER:

1

Correct, Your Honor, but the

2

question is sort of what is relationship, and that's

3

precisely what this Court looked at in Blue Cross and

4

other cases in which they've deemed, what is the

5

relationship, which is only informed by knowing what the

6

purposes, the objectives of the statute were.

7

In McCarran, what Congress has tried to avoid,

8

everyone agrees, was inadvertent preemption, inadvertent

9

application of law to the business of insurance, to the

10

spreading, the transfer of risk, the protection of the

11

policyholder.

That's how --

QUESTION:

12

Every -- I mean, that's what I'd like

13

us -- can you just spend a minute helping me out with

14

that?

15

The -- my impression from reading Pireno and the

16

SEC, the cases that we talked about, is that this is

17

rather narrow, this word, regulation of insurance, and

18

really refers to where the policyholder -- what do you

19

charge him, what are the terms of the contract, et cetera.

20

This is a statute that says big banks but not

21

little banks can go into the insurance businesses in small

22

towns -- the opposite, big banks can't, little banks can.

23

To me, is this more like a merger?

24

are the entities that own these agents, and mergers are

25

outside the word regulation.

contract are inside regulation.

QUESTION:

MS. KAPPLER:

Why isn't this more like

Because --

That's what I need a little help on.
If I might, Your Honor, because

8

mergers, as the Court held, the particular Arizona merger

9

law that was at issue it concluded was in fact enacted to

10

protect stockholders, not to protect the interests of the

11

policyholders.

12

QUESTION:

So if in fact, if that's the key,

13

then we go back to a law that says they don't have to pay

14

income tax, they don't have to comply with a whole bunch

15

of things, because that protects stockholders.

16

a lot of ways we could - -

17

MS. KAPPLER:

There are

No, Your Honor, if it protects

18

stockholders it is not enacted for the purpose of

19

regulating insurance.

That's what national securities --

20

QUESTION:

All right, I mean --

21

MS. KAPPLER:

22

QUESTION:

And --

-- we go back to the income tax and

23

all these exemptions that will protect policyholders.

24

That can't be the law, I wouldn't think.

Your Honor, I think you're echoing

the difficulty the dissent had in Fabe with the test that

2

the majority set up.

3

QUESTION:

4

MS. KAPPLER:

5
6

I absolutely am.
But -- and so the question is, how

close must the protection of policyholders be?
QUESTION:

And Fabe seemed to be a case in which

7

the Court majority held that the policyholder has a

8

secured interest in the money that will go to pay off that

9

policy, and if that's so, Fabe is a case that's pretty

10

closely related to the very dollars that are going to pay

11

the policyholder, much more close to the words of the

12

contract than to a merger of the entities owning.

13

MS. KAPPLER:

Your Honor, it is precisely

14

related to whether --as found by every State court that

15

has looked at this, as reflected in the legislative

16

history, as confirmed by those administrators, that it

17

goes directly to whether the policyholder can purchase a

18

policy that is best suited for him or whether they will be

19

coerced into buying a policy they do not want to purchase.

20

That particular decision, the decision whether

21

the policy is one that is appropriate for them, that was

22

the design behind it.

establishment of the relationship between the policyholder

24

and the insurer.

I don't understand.

MS. KAPPLER:

Your Honor, just the exceptions

you're struggling with and Justice Souter was struggling

with, the Glendale court struggled with, and found that

5

these were reasonable decisions the court -- the

legislature could have made, and in fact they could have

decided, these little banks, that there was a problem with

the accessibility of insurance in these small towns, so

That's what you'd like --

MS. KAPPLER:

QUESTION:

Well, it also found that --

Because they need the money, so we'll

14

let the little banks coerce but not the big banks.

15

can't believe that that's what they --

No, certainly not.

Certainly not,

towards what petitioner wants to say the statute is.

Petitioner wants to say this statute just is a protection

for independent insurance agents, why did they let them

That's their whole argument.
