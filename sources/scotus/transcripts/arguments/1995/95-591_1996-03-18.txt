ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. MINEAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether section 4371

12

of the Internal Revenue Code runs afoul of the Export

13

Clause of the Constitution.

14

generally applicable tax not limited to exports on

15

premiums paid by foreign insurers for risks that occur

16

wholly or partly within the United States.

17

a competitive advantage that foreign insurers would

18

otherwise enjoy by virtue of their exemption from the

19

Federal income tax.

20

Section 4371 imposes a

It eliminates

The Federal Circuit ruled that the Export Clause

21

prohibits the application of that tax to insurance

associated with exports.

decision in Thames & Mersey v. United States compelled

that result.

They concluded that this Court's

2

from precedent when it was decided 80 years ago, and it

3

rested on a Commerce-Clause rationale this Court has since

4

repudiated.

5

That decision was a departure

But perhaps most important, Thames cannot be

6

reconciled with this Court's modern tax decisions, which

7

have worked a basic change in the law.

8

Michelin Tire and Washington Stevedoring, have, in the

9

words of the Court, abandoned the past practice of

Those decisions,

10

examining when goods lose their character as imports or

11

exports, and has refocused the inquiry on the nature of

12

the tax at issue.

13

Using that approach, the Court has concluded

14

that the Import-Export Clause does not prohibit the

15

application of generally applicable taxes, but rather

16

prohibits - -

17

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Minear, we're dealing here

18

with the Export Clause, not the Import - Export Clause,

19

isn't that right?

20

MR. MINEAR:

21

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
And it certainly is possible that the

22

Export Clause has different purposes than the Import-

23

Export Clause.

24
25

MR. MINEAR:

That is possible, but we do not

think it is borne out by either the language or the

QUESTION:

5

You do concede that if we do not

MR. MINEAR:

That is correct.

We have made that

concession in the briefs.
QUESTION:

6

And it obviously would require

7

ultimately overruling more than just Thames & Mersey.

There are some other cases that are of the same genre, are

they not?

Thames and Mersey - -

But relatively few, Your Honor.

there were four cases that were decided before

13

QUESTION:

14

Why not leave them in place?
MR. MINEAR:

15

Well, why should we do that at all?
What harm does it do?

The harm that it does is,

it

16

results in a lack of coherence in this Court's overall

17

approach to the problem in this area.
QUESTION:

18

In

Well, occasionally one has that.

We

19

certainly have the precedents out there, and I just --

20

you're going to have to persuade me that there are some

21

very important reasons for overturning these longstanding

22

precedents.

QUESTION:

And this is a separate provisions,

even in the Export -Import Clause.

5

MR. MINEAR:

Your Honor,

I'd like to answer both

of the questions, both of the points that you made there.
First, this Court has consistently interpreted

6

the Export Clause and the Import - Export Clause as imposing

7

a parallel limitation on the Federal and State Governments

8

with respect to exports.

9

consistency that has run through this Court's cases in the

If there's one element of

10

past 175 years,

11

interpreted consistently.

12

it is that those two clauses should be

And secondly,

there is a question of the

13

language difference.

Respondent asserts that the Export

14

Clause should be read as a more extensive prohibition

15

because it uses the term,

16

term, impost or duty, but the terms tax and impost are

17

synonymous, and the operative phrase in this context is

18

functionally identical.

tax or duty,

rather than the

19

QUESTION:

Well, why are they synonymous?

20

QUESTION:

Why did the Framers use different

21
22

language, then?
MR. MINEAR:

The Framers frequently used

23

synonymous terms to express the same idea.

24

the Framers stated that Congress would have the power to

25

raise and support armies, but also to provide and maintain

For example,

1

a Navy.

It said that Congress would have the power to

2

establish post offices, but to constitute tribunals.

3

very nature of a synonym is, frequently it can be used

4

interchangeably with no change in meaning.
QUESTION:

5

The

Well, I don't think that carries you

6

very -- to provide and maintain a Navy, you're providing

7

ships, whereas to raise and support armies, you're

8

conscripting troops.
MR. MINEAR:

9

But this -- the overall content of

10

those phrases, they convey the same general meaning, and

11

that's the point that Chief Justice Marshall made in 1827

12

in the case of Brown v. Maryland.

13

some diversity in language,

14

prohibited is the same, and that provision, that statement

15

has been followed by this Court, as I say, in numerous

16

cases.

17

QUESTION:

18

hasn't been followed.

MR. MINEAR:

As he stated, there is

Yes, even though the case itself

The case itself has been followed

20

in significant part.

It's true that the aspect of the

21

case originally -- relating to the original package

22

doctrine has not been followed.

23

seen as a restriction, but one of the ironies of this case

24

is that what the respondent's position would do is

25

actually reintroduce the very notion of the original

package doctrine, or at least the converse of it in the

2

sense of taxes on exports.

3

QUESTION:

Are you concerned that the original

4

package doctrine has to be introduced, or something like

5

it, if we attempt some halfway solution where we rule in

6

your favor saying there cannot be a tax on the export, but

7

that if there is an indirect tax, then the discrimination

8

rule applies?

i

MR. MINEAR:

9

Yes.

That is a problem, that we

10

believe that one of the basic points in this Court's

11

decision in Michelin Tire and Washington Stevedoring was

12

to abandon that type of inquiry, this inquiry --

13
14

QUESTION:

Mr. Minear, you mentioned Washington

Stevedoring, which involved the cost of loading, and --

15

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

The tax was applied to

%

16
17

loading and unloading the ships.
QUESTION:

And I thought that the whole idea of

18

that is that that was a discrete item, that you could

19

separate the stevedoring, the loading of the vessel from

20

the goods, and I was struck by your brief that you don't

21

make any lesser argument.

22

because it's on the insurance and not on the goods.

23

seem to concede that the tax should be treated as though

24

it were on the goods.

25

MR. MINEAR:

You don't say, this tax is okay

It's another

problem that was introduced by that case.

We don't have to worry about that.
MR. MINEAR:

10

But that is --

The bigger problem is the one that

we're concerned with, and that was the application -- yes.
QUESTION:

11

in this case,

Excuse me.

It seems to me that you

could,

say this is not a tax on the goods

QUESTION:

18

MR. MINEAR:

That's correct.
The Spalding case, et cetera.
And the problem,

the reason why we

19

chose not to do that is because it is - - it requires us to

but it seems to me that the issue ought to be addressed

2

now, that this is a problem that has continued to plague

3

this area - -

4

QUESTION:

Well, how does your theory not

5

require us to figure out what are imports and what aren't

6

imports?

7

placed on imports you have to decide the same question.

8

Let's assume you have a task that is only placed upon

9

insurance of exports.

10

Wouldn't you still have to decide

whether that's, in effect, a tax upon exports?
MR. MINEAR:

11

12

Even to decide whether a tax is discriminatorily

Then you might well have to face

that question, but the test -QUESTION:

13

Of course.

I don't see how that

14

question is eliminated by adopting the theory that you're

15

pressing upon us.

16

MR. MINEAR:

The test that we propose will

17

eliminate that inquiry in most every case, because the

18

initial question will be, is this tax discriminatory, and

19

that's a question that can usually be answered quite

20

easily.
QUESTION:

21

Oh, but you've got to say

22

discriminatory against what, and to determine the what,

23

you've got to decide whether the subject of the tax should

be treated as an export.

MR. MINEAR:

1

Well, on the other hand, Your

2

Honor,

if a tax applies across the board to all types of

3

transactions,

to get into the question of what is an export and what

5

isn't, as long as --

it is not discriminatory,

QUESTION:

6

So if the South,

so you do not need

in other words,

7

exports 100 percent of its indigo crop -- no,

8

only 99.99 percent, and Congress were to pass a tax saying

9

all shipments of indigo pay a 10 percent tax,

10

that's nondiscriminatory and,

11

Constitution was enacted,
MR. MINEAR:

12

let's say

in your view

therefore, at the time this

the court should have upheld it?

I think that the question of

13

whether any particular tax is going to be discriminatory

14

may require a further analysis.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. MINEAR:

What about the case I put?
At the moment that that tax is

17

imposed, perhaps it is a tax on exports, but you must

18

remember that markets constantly change.
QUESTION:

19

The question I think that was being

20

asked is,

21

the tax is on an export or not even under your analysis?

22

isn't -- don't you have to figure out whether

MR. MINEAR:

You do, but you can -- the analysis

23

we propose simplifies this area in the same way that it

24

has simplified the area in the Import - Export Clause cases

25

by focusing on the nature of the tax.

products, then it would not fall within the purview of the

Export Clause.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Minear --

5

QUESTION:

No, but that's --

6

QUESTION:

-- would you explain to me why you

7

don't make the argument, the simple argument that what

8

Congress had in mind was evening out the situation for

9

domestic insurers, because this would apply to the --

10

suppose there were a foreign company that was insuring

11

entirely domestic transport, the tax would apply, right?
MR. MINEAR:

12

QUESTION:

3

Yes.
And yet that seems such a simple

argument that you avoid, and I'm not clear on why you're

doing that.

We do not mean to avoid that

argument.

21

That's part of our argument of why this is a

In this particular context, in fact, the tax
appears to be more an import tax than an export tax.
Remember, this is a tax that is being imposed on

22

the basis of foreign insurers selling insurance in this

23

country on the basis -- to protect against risks that

24

occur wholly or partly in the United States, but our

argument is addressed to the broader problem here, and

that's why we think that you need to reconsider Thames &

Mersey.

3

The -- our concerns here are not limited to just

4

this case, but rather to add incoherence to the overall

5

body of law here.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Minear, I'm just skeptical that

7

the canny southerners who got this provision included in

8

the Constitution were resigned to the notion that if a tax

9

were placed upon indigo, it would be up to the courts as

10

to whether that was a discriminatory -- you know, upon

11

shipments of indigo.

12

was being exported, and that's your analysis, right, that

13

if, in fact, almost all indigo was being exported, that

14

would be a discriminatory tax.

MR. MINEAR:

It would depend upon what percentage

It could be.

I'm not saying that

it would be.

20

protection the southerners thought they got when they got

21

22

MR. MINEAR:

Well, if we're looking to what the

23

Framers were concerned about, I think that the Convention

24

debates indicate they were concerned about export taxes.

25

At that period, they were familiar with the types of taxes

1

that were commonly imposed on trade and, during that era,

2

it was very common to impose a tax on exports.

3

In fact, the Convention debates make specific

4

reference to the tax that France imposed upon her wines

5

and brandies that were exported and the tax that England

6

imposed on its woollen products as well.

7

they saw as the danger - - a tax that would be imposed upon

8

exports that would fall disproportionately on the southern

9

States which had developed an export economy.

10

QUESTION:

Well,

11

disproportionality,

is it?

would go broke one way or the other?

That is what

it was the

1

discrimination, isn't that fair to say?
MR. MINEAR:

2

I think that they were -- they

3

realized that their ultimate protection from taxation in

4

the southern States, as well in the North, lie in the

5

establishment of a Congress composed of two Houses that

6

would provide the representation that would give weight to

7

their concerns.
QUESTION:

9

Well, if that's all they were

concerned about, then they didn't need the clause in the

10

first place.

I mean, they wanted that clause.

11

not taking this on faith, and the reason they wanted that

12

clause ultimately turned on the economic effect of the

13

tax, and I suppose the economic effect of the tax is going

14

to be exactly the same, or was expected to be exactly the

15

same whether you or I called it discriminatory or not.

I mean, isn't that a fair objection?

It was to the notion of the export

You're -- well, then you're being

23

inconsistent in your analysis.

24

that if 99 percent of indigo is exported, a tax generally

on the sale of indigo would be a discriminatory tax.

MR. MINEAR:

2

QUESTION:

My view on that is -Which is it?

If they're concerned

3

only with taxes on exports, then that hypothetical should

4

not be a dis -- should not come within the Export Clause.
MR. MINEAR:

5

I'd like to clarify my answer on

6

that, and that is that the tax on an object that is 100

7

percent exported might very well be a discriminatory tax

8

if it's a pretext for imposing a tax on exports.

9

But there are other types of taxes that would,

10

in fact, fall exclusively on an exported product, yet we

11

would hesitate to call them an export tax, and let me give

12

you the example of a medicine, for instance, that is not

13

approved for use in the United States but is approved for

14

use elsewhere, and as a result it is -- tends to be

15

exported.

16

Congress could impose a tax on that, I believe,

17

without violating the Export Clause to cover the specific

18

cost that the Government incurs in going through the FDA

19

approval process, and that's why I say you need to look to

20

the actual purpose of the tax - -

indicated by the Export Clause.

QUESTION:

MR. MINEAR:

It's a tax of general application

the percentage that isn't?

No.

This tax applies not simply to

that you're postulating here, the approach is to look at

MR. MINEAR:

MR. MINEAR:

That might explain it, that's true.

QUESTION:

Let me ask you this.

I thought that

under cases like this stevedoring case we wouldn't say

7

that a tax is nondiscriminatory unless it bears a

8

reasonable relationship with the privilege of doing

business within the taxing jurisdiction.

10

I'm not certain that a tax imposed on insurance

11

on goods traveling overseas bears a reasonable

12

relationship to the United States under that test.

13

MR. MINEAR:

Oh, I believe that the tax here is

14

designed to eliminate the competitive advantage that

15

foreign insurers enjoy in this market by their exemption

16

from the Federal income tax, and this Court has recognized

that that type of tax is permissible.

MR. MINEAR:

But you've already given it a

Justice Marshall's first opinion, where he felt that

12

I think these terms have really become, in a

sense, terms of art that are tied to the objectives that

the Framers sought to convey through the Constitution.

15

I would also point out that this Court has used

MR. MINEAR:

Because that is the one source of

consistency in this area of law in the past 170 years, and

even in Washington Stevedores, this Court cited Export

MR. ATWOOD:

Government has put together in a way that ends up being

9

misleading two different things that John Marshall said,

10

I think the

Chief Justice Marshall.

11

In the -- where he said the clauses are similar,

12

he was addressing the issue of whether a tax imposed on an

13

occupation is a tax on an import, and it was in that

14

context that he drew an analogy to the Export Clause and

15

said both clauses are similar in that they use similar

language as to what's prohibited, what act is prohibited,

were similar.

That's where he said the clauses

1

there, to quote the Government's reply brief on page 12,

2

the Court concluded that the term impost is not used in a

3

narrow or fixed manner, but generally signifies a tax

4

levied on articles brought into the country, so we agree

5

with Marshall's statement.

6

consistent with Michelin that in the context of these

7

clauses, impost had a rather specific meaning.

8

9

I think his statement is

Thames & Mersey was not a departure from
existing law at the time.

The Court's decisions on the

10

Export Clause have been perfectly consistent.

11

said from the beginning that Federal taxes may not be

12

applied to the export process itself.

13

They have

They've also said that if the export journey has

of discrimination is important.

starting with Turpin v. Burgess, have said that you can --

the Federal Government cannot tax the export process

itself, and Thames & Mersey is squarely within that line

of authority.

But all of the cases,

Now, concerning the questions, I guess Justice

21

Kennedy raised and perhaps Justice Ginsburg, as to whether

22

this is sufficiently indirect that it's not a tax on

that they are not disputing that this tax, if

2

discriminatory, is in violation of the Constitution.
They are not challenging that aspect of Thames &

5

they would have to challenge not just Thames & Mersey,

6

they'd have to go back and challenge Chief Justice

Marshall's holding in Brown v. Maryland that a tax on

occupation is a tax on an import, they'd have to challenge

the Fairbank decision, which they've embraced throughout

1

to an item that both exporters and nonexporters might buy,

2

in some proportion we know not what, why is that a tax on

3

the good that is exported?

4

MR. ATWOOD:

Because when it is purchased for a

5

shipment of goods, as in the case here, there is a

6

separate premium charged for every shipment.

7

every computer that's boxed up, a separate premium is

8

charged for that shipment from the time it leaves IBM's

9

plant to the time it's delivered abroad.

10

Every box,

That premium varies directly with the value of

11

that product, because if it's an expensive machine it has

12

a higher premium than if it's an inexpensive --

13

QUESTION:

But that's not the only variable.

If

14

you ship from Chicago to Toronto I'm sure that the value

15

of the good is the predominant part of the premium, but if

16

you ship from an IBM headquarters to India by steamship,

17

I'm sure those other factors are much more significant in

18

calculating the premium than the value of the goods.

19

MR. ATWOOD:

The extent to which the value of

20

the good determines the premium will vary with the length

21

of shipment, but you know, the longer shipments, longer

22

exports are taxed more than shorter shipments.

23

to us, again, to get back to a direct tax on the export

24

process -- separate premium for each product, it varies

25

with the value, it varies with the distance.

That seems

That's a tax

on the export process.
QUESTION:

2

It's slightly different --

Well, that's the way you characterize

it.

You might also say that that's a tax on the insurance

4

aspect, which brings us back to what we're arguing about.
QUESTION:

5

I suppose that's an interesting

6

philosophical question, whether you continue to export

7

until you reach India, or has your export stopped at least

8

when you reach the territorial waters of the United

9

States?

I'm not sure where the exporting stops.
MR. ATWOOD:

10

I guess the way this tax has been

11

administered is, it goes from one -- from where the good

12

takes off from where the good lands, and in terms of the

13

Court's jurisprudence under the Export Clause and under

14

the Import Clause, I think they treat that entire journey

15

as an integrated whole.
The Spalding case says the export process starts

16
17

when you turn over the goods to a common carrier.

18

Marshall, you recall, in Brown v. Maryland,

19

addressed the question, does the import and export only

20

occur when the goods cross the border?

a longer process than that.

He said, no, it's

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. MINEAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

I would like to point out,

first,

that what

5

respondent is arguing for here is something that is truly

6

peculiar.

7

In this one area under the Constitution the

8

States would have broader authority than the Federal

9

Government on a matter respecting foreign commerce.

That

10

is the result of their interpretation,

11

interpretations of the Export Clause and the Import - Export

12

Clause.

13

their differing

I think that strikes one as surprising.
QUESTION:

Well, but that's certainly the result

14

of the cases decided under the Export Clause.

15

in Fairbank,

16

It's true

is it not, and certainly in Mersey?

MR. MINEAR:

No,

I think if we look at the

17

actual cases -- now,

18

case in which this Court struck down a Federal tax on an

19

Export Clause theory, and that was a discriminatory tax,

20

and that tax would have been viewed as violative of the

21

Import - Export Clause as well at that time.

22

Fairbanks was the only -- the first

What we're arguing is the same prohibition

23

24

taxes are Federal or State taxes.

MR. MINEAR:

The tax there,

I think that under

3

the Import - Export Clause, until this Court's reasoning,

4

new reasoning in Michelin Tires and Washington Stevedores,

5

a State tax on insurance related to exports would have

6

also been struck down.

7

extent of the prohibition would have been the same under

8

either clause.

So in other words, the tax -- the

Now that the prohibition has - - this Court has

at Thames & Mersey as a case where the incidence of the

tax fell directly on the export.

3

MR. MINEAR:

I think that they are, though, if

To be sure, the

Yes, but the tax in Washington

Stevedores was on the service, and thus wasn't directly

related to the value of the good, and it's therefore a tax

11

on the service, not on the good, and here the "big if"

12

clause that I said before means we have to assume it's a

13

tax on the good.

14
15

MR. MINEAR:

And I believe it's -- excuse me,

Your Honor.

1

like to turn to, too, and that is this whole notion of

2

trying to determine when a tax is laid upon the export

3

process.

4

for many years under the Import - Export Clause, and you

5

look at the line of cases that came through here, and

6

there is no consistency here.

7

This has been a problem that bedeviled the Court

Spalding said that the tax applied when the

8

product was handed to a common carrier, but Joy Petroleum

9

said that if a product stops along the way and is put in

10

storage,

then it is subject to a local tax.
QUESTION:

11

Well, Thames & Mersey was decided in

12

1915, and I don't see any great trouble having resulted

13

between then and now in applying the Export Clause.
MR. MINEAR:

14

Well,

there have been very few

15

cases since Spalding simply because the effect of the

16

Export Clause is so draconian, and it is this case that we

17

have chosen to ask the Court to review its thinking in

18

this area, and to bring it in line with the Import - Export

19

Clause.

20

QUESTION:

Well, once again, Mr. Minear, as I

21

think we established earlier, you will enable us to avoid

22

that question usually, at most, because we can decide the

23

question simply on the basis that the tax is not

24

discriminatory, but where it is discriminatory we are

25

going to have to address this same question anyway.

You

1

are not eliminating that difficulty from our

2

j urisprudence.

3

MR. MINEAR:

But that's not an unusual problem,

4

that the taxpayer will bear the burden of showing that a

5

tax that appears to be fair on its face is discriminatory

6

in a particular context, and --

7

QUESTION:

No, but once you decide it's

8

discriminatory, you are then going to have to decide

9

whether it is laid upon the process of export, so that,

10

you know, that difficulty that you're now addressing, it

11

isn't eliminated from our jurisprudence entirely.

12

can say is you won't have to face it as often as you now

13

do.

14

MR. MINEAR:

All you

That's right, but the same thing

15

was true with regard to the Import - Export Clause.

16

instance, there is still the question of what happens if a

17

State imposes a property tax on property that is in

18

transit through the State without stopping, on the

19

property that's being transported on the rail cars as it

moves through the State?

Can they tax that?

has been left open in Michelin Tire, and likewise there

will be some issues that will be left open here.
