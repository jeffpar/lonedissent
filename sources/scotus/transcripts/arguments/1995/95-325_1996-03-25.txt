QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

And I'm getting it, too, Your Honor.

Either you or we.

Well, I take comfort in the thought

that we're all suffering together here.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16

You're

MR. JONES:

This case presents two questions.

17

The first question is whether the tax imposed by section

18

4971 of the Internal Revenue Code is within the priority

19

that Congress has established for excise taxes in section

20

507(a)(7)(E) of the Bankruptcy Code.

21

The second question is whether, if this tax is

22

not entitled to that statutory priority, it may then be

23

subordinated to the claims of general unsecured creditors

24

under the principles of equitable subordination that we've

25

been discussing.

1

I would like to briefly discuss the second

2

question first.

3

said to stand, or present the question of whether the

4

principles of equitable subordination on grounds of

5

fairness alone, would permit a court to deviate from what

6

is known as the absolute priority rule.

7

discussed by this Court in the Norwest Bank case, is that

8

all claims of a higher priority have to be paid before any

9

claim of a lower priority is paid.

10

The case that was just argued could be

That rule, as

In the case that was just argued, the higher

11

priority was the first priority for postpetition tax

12

penalty claims.

13

This case, the second question in this case, if

14

it is reached, could be said to present the question of

15

whether the principles of equitable subordination permit a

16

court, again on grounds of fairness alone, to deviate from

17

what is called the equality of distribution rule.

18

rule, as discussed

19

that all claims of the same rank must be paid pro rata,

20

without discrimination among them.

21

That

by this Court in the Begier case, is

Now, because, in our view, the principles of

22

equitable subordination are the same in both contexts, and

23

in the absence of creditor misconduct don't permit

24

subordination either of claims of the same or of a

25

different rank, the court of appeals erred in this case in

1

subordinating the innocent claim of the United States.
Thus, if the court was right that the claim of

2

3

the United States didn't have a statutory priority, it was

4

wrong in then saying that the innocent claim of the United

5

States could be subordinated to other general, unsecured

6

claims.

•7

11

That violates the principle of equality of

distribution and it also -QUESTION:

So you're saying, in effect, even if

you lose on the first question, you're entitled to some
sort of relief on the second question?
MR. JONES:

Yes.

The relief that we would be

12

entitled to would be to be treated pro rata with other

13

general unsecured claims, if we're not a priority claim.

14

Now, the first question in this case is whether

15

we are a priority claim.

16

Revenue Code was enacted in 1974 as part of ERISA.

17

imposes a tax of 10 percent on underfunded pension plans.

18

Congress expressly designated and described this tax as an

19

excise tax, and it --

20

QUESTION:

Section 4971 of the Internal
It

Well, do you agree that language

21

doesn't always control, that something can be called a tax

22

and, in fact, be a penalty?

23

MR. JONES:

I agree that something can be called

24

a tax that isn't, but there are two reasons why we think

25

the designation of this tax as an excise tax is important,

1

which I'll soon address, but I did want to make the point

2

here that this tax does have the two features which are

3

common to excise taxes, and by the way, excise taxes are

4

probably the most common kind of tax there is.

5

QUESTION:

This section deals not just with the

Federal Government, but with all governmental entities.
MR. JONES:

That's right, any State, Federal, or

local excise tax.
Subtitles B through E of the Internal Revenue

10

Code are all excise taxes.

11

employment taxes, miscellaneous excise taxes, alcohol and

12

tobacco taxes -- Congress has a lot of excise taxes, but

13

the common feature, what you can see if you go through

14

them, is there are two common features.

15

There's the estate taxes,

They're not universally present, but they're the

16

common characteristics of excises, and those are that it

17

is imposed upon a specific act or event, in this case the

18

act of maintaining an underfunded pension plan, and second

19

is that it's imposed of a portion of the value of that act

20

or event, in this case a portion of the value of the

21

underfunding.

'

22;

Now, 4 years after this tax was enacted,

23

Congress, in restructuring the Bankruptcy Code, enacted

24

507(a)(7)(E), which provides a specific, unqualified

25

priority for any State, Federal, or local excise tax.

(800) FOR DEPO

The

1

court of appeals reasoned in this case that that priority

2

could not reach this tax, because this tax was designed to

3

enforce another law.

4

violation of another law, and the court regarded it as a

5

penalty, and as a penalty the court concluded it wouldn't

6

come within the priority for an excise tax.

It was designed to deter the

7

QUESTION:

Because it was a nonpecuniary loss --

8

MR. JONES:

A nonpecuniary loss penalty, which

9
10

simply means that it's a penalty that doesn't recover
money that would otherwise be owed, I guess.
Now, whether you look at the text of the

11
12

statute, or its structure, or its history, the reasoning

13

of the court of appeals cannot be sustained.

14

course, which under Ron Pair is what we're supposed to

15

look at, says unqualifiedly that any excise tax, State,

16

Federal, or local, is entitled to this priority.

17

doesn't contain any suggestion that an excise --

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. JONES:

20
21

The text, of

It

Well, Mr. --- that has a regulatory purpose is

not.
QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, it does have one

22

qualification, and that is, it uses the word transaction,

23

rather than act or event, and I mean, just in common uses

24

that implies something more, doesn't it, than the passage

25

of the deadline without payment?

Would we normally

1

describe that as a transaction?
MR. JONES:

2

The transaction language in that

3

code is designed to key off the, if you will, statute of

4

limitations that applies to excise tax claims.

5

Respondents agree --

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. JONES:

8

QUESTION:
MR. JONES:

Does it use the word transaction?
Does which?
Does the statute of limitations?
No, I didn't -- I was not being

10

precise.

I don't mean to say a statute of limitations,

11

but if you look at 507(a)(7)

12

of which address various kinds of tax claims, each of them

13

has a limitation as to the scope of a claim to fall within

14

the priority.

(A),

(B),

(C),

(D),

(E), all

15

For example, the language in (a)(7)(E), if I'm

16

paraphrasing it properly, is that the tax has to be with

17

respect to a transaction for which a report is due within

18

3 years of the filing of the petition.

1

The word transaction has a broad meaning, and

20

couldn't be reasonably understood to be a narrow meaning.

21

For example, estate taxes are excise taxes.

22

bargained-for exchange if you think of transaction that

23

way?

What's the

There's no bargained-for exchange there.

24

The transaction language is the act --

These taxes you say are excise taxes,

1

that's well-established?

2

MR. JONES:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. JONES:

Yes.

Estate gift taxes are excises.

How is that established?
Well, it's not addressed in the

5

briefs, Your Honor, but I think it's -- it's established

6

in the case law and treatises.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. JONES:

9

Well, what cases?
I'm sorry, I'm not prepared -- I

don't have an answer to that question now.

I'm just

10

speaking from, if you will, my general knowledge.

Excises

11

are taxes that would include estate taxes, just as they

12

include sales taxes.

13

They are at -- this Court talked about the fact

14

that excises, customs duties, and income taxes are really

15

sort of the whole gamut, or as the Court said in the

16

Steadman Machine case, the -- all of the taxes appropriate

17

to sovereignty, and you can track that through the way

18

Congress --

19
20
21

QUESTION:

Are you saying that all taxes

appropriate to sovereignty are excise taxes?
MR. JONES:

No, sir.

I said that income,

22

customs duties, and excises -- the Court used the phrase,

23

appropriate to sovereignty in the Steadman Machine case.

24
25

If you think about it, customs duties are in
title 19, income taxes are in subtitle A of title 26, and

1

2

as I said, subtitles B through E of title 26 are excises.
QUESTION:

So your theory is that the Court said

3

customs, income, and excise taxes, and they were covering

4

the waterfront there, and therefore if something isn't a

5

customs duty and isn't an income tax, it is by definition

6

an excise tax?

7

MR. JONES:

I think that the point the Court was

8

making was that these are broad and flexible terms.

9

don't think the Court in the case that I referred to was

10

trying to be specific in the way that you're suggesting.

11

QUESTION:

I

Well, what if a State had structured

12

its tax scheme differently than the Federal Government?

13

mean, I take it we have to deal with State tax schemes

14

here, too --

15

MR. JONES:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- and the Federal Government doesn't

17

get any bigger a break than the State does in trying to

18

figure out whether it's an excise tax or not.

19

MR. JONES:

I

Well, I wouldn't say any bigger a

20

break, but I do think that the Mansfield Tire court was

21

probably right in saying that when Congress expressly

22

designates something as an excise tax there's no reason to

23

think it didn't intend to have its excises included within

24

the priority that it adopted for excise taxes.

25

QUESTION:

Well, does that really make much

sense?

I mean, the same committees of Congress don't

2

draft bankruptcy bills as draft tax bills.

3

MR. JONES:

It makes sense if you think about it

4

from two perspectives.

5

the fact that. Congress is the one -- I mean, if you're

6

trying to decide what is the excise tax, the best evidence

7

of that is -- would be to go through the Internal Revenue

8

Code and to see what Congress has done.

9

It makes sense if you think about

I mean, when I suggested that there are two

10

common characteristics for excises, I think that was

11

correct, and that's based on observation of what Congress

12

has done.

13

more taxes than anybody.

14

Congress has probably enacted as many, if not

Mr. Jones, the section doesn't

1

MR. JONES:

It's a broad use of the word

2

transaction, and you can only understand it in a broad

3

context when you understand the broad concept of excises.

4

QUESTION:

Of course, maybe the point for your

5

side is that no one has come up with a reason why Congress

6

would want to draw the line between an excise payable,

7

excise tax payable on a failure to do something as

8

distinct from an excise tax payable because of some

9

affirmative action.

MR. JONES:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. JONES:

Well -At least, I don't have an idea.
I don't think there's any reason to

13

think Congress thought it was drawing such a line.

spoke quite broadly that it's priority would extend to any

generally considered to be an excise.

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

5

Well, come on, we have to have that

I understand that.
-- and you know we're going to face

it.
MR. JONES:

6

The United States has never pursued

7

in an appellate court the question of the priority of the

8

subsection (b) tax, and there are reasons to think that
the treatment to be accorded to those taxes is different

10

than the treatment to be accorded to the 10-percent

11

priority.
There are two differences that I think can be

12

13

addressed at this point.

14

exist.

15

There are others that may also

There is, of course, the facial difference

16

between a 10-percent tax that conforms to the, if you

17

will, ordinary concept of an excise as a tax on the

18

portion of the value, and a 100-percent tax, which is --

QUESTION:

20

MR. JONES:

22

Which looks something like a penalty.
Which would be, I suppose, a

whopping big excise tax.
Whether Congress can enact a whopping big excise

tax is something that I don't think that there's any

24

reason to think it can't, but I think it's something we'd

25

have to address if we ever argued that case.

very high.
Now, the other point that I think is a more
problematic distinction between those two taxes --

MR. JONES:

9

(Laughter.)

10

Well, if an estate tax is an excise

More problematic than whopping big?
Yes.

MR. JONES:

More problematic even than whopping

11

big is the fact that the (b) tax, unlike the (a) tax, and

12

unlike, if you will, many other excise taxes in the

13

Internal Revenue Code, is expressly subject to waiver by

14

the Secretary of the Treasury on any grounds that he

15

thinks is appropriate.

16

That's a -- that kind of discretionary

17

enforcement would raise a question about whether Congress

18

has treated this as a tax.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

Is the (b) tax expressly labeled an

excise tax?
MR. JONES:

No, it's labeled -- expressly

labeled in the statute a tax.

to reserve the question, but even if you were later to

In United States v. New

It did it under the Bankruptcy Act.

The question in that case was whether an excise

longer an excise tax.

13

in United States v. New York is that the mere fact that a

14

tax is designed to enforce some other, in this case State

15

law doesn't make it, in the words of the Court, any the

less a tax, doesn't remove it from the statutory priority.

point that many, if not most Federal excises have a

reasonably expect to see some evidence of that in the text

the unqualified statement that any excise, Federal, State,

because it doesn't seem to be on an activity, though there

are things on your side, too, which you very well argued,

It's a prepetition claim.

Yes.
All right.

So why in this section,

7

in this Chapter 11 case didn't the bankruptcy judge just

8

say, this is a penalty, therefore I put it in a different

9

class.

10

I put it in a class which would be the class it

would be in if this were a Chapter 7.
I put it in a class below unsecured creditors,

11
12

and therefore I don't have to worry about equitable

13

subordination or not, and since he could have just as

14

easily done that, which would have come to the identical

15

thing, he just used the wrong words to describe what he

16

did, and therefore that issue drops out of the case.

correct is that when you cram down, if you will, the

priorities from the 7 into the 11, what the courts have

it's apparent from the language of section 507(a)(7)(E)

that that line, indeed, was drawn because of the language,

Section 302 of ERISA requires that a plan

that statutory obligation that this exaction is imposed,

so that many of the other excise taxes imposed under the

difficult to reach the question of equitable subordination

without deciding whether or not the bankruptcy judge would

raised that.

them for the proposition that you cannot set up a

Of course that's true --

MR. McCARDELL:

QUESTION:

It's --

think of that particular argument.

the bankruptcy judge would have the power in Chapter 11 to

Wouldn't we have to

The court of appeals affirmed

5

the confirmation order, which is one of the three orders.

6

The order approving the plan is one of the three orders on

7

appeal today, so that by affirming the confirmation order,

8

the Court will approve the subordination that's provided

9

for in the plan.
It's difficult for us to understand why the IRS

10
11

doesn't want to address it, but it is an independent

12

ground for subordination that really does exist in the

13

plan, and really was -- really occurred in this case, so

14

that by reaching --by simply considering the confirmation

15

order as one of the three orders, the Court does have that

16

issue before it.

17

The two statues which provide for that

18

subordination are section 1122, which provides that claims

19

may not be placed in a class unless they're substantially

20

similar.

21

to the general unsecured claims, first because they don't

22

represent a pecuniary loss, and second, because they have

and as the IRS has conceded in the Chapter 7 case, penalty-

claims not entitled to priority would be subordinated.

equitable factors, would be appropriate grounds for

7

simply disallowed entirely under the Bankruptcy Act, and

8

to suggest that by saying nothing Congress intended to

9

suddenly elevate those claims to the seventh priority is

10

11

Where the Bankruptcy Code intends to incorporate a

quite a stretch, as we view the development of the law.
The legislative history on which the IRS relies

12

time after time in its brief simply says that exactions

13

that are taxes may -- are covered by this priority if

14

they're excises, but they must be taxes first, and so we

15

ask the Court to consider with regard to this exaction the

16

traditional test, which the IRS conceded in the lower

17

courts it did not satisfy, and did not -- never came

18

forward with any evidence that it satisfied that test,

19

which was its burden as the claimant in this case.

QUESTION:

You know, Sheppard's Tax Dictionary

21

does have a definition for minimum funding excise tax

22

which, it refers to this particular provision, so the tax

23

community as reflected by the tax dictionary calls it an

24

excise tax.

We've cited the conflicting line of cases on

the Latterman case and the Rockefeller case, where there

is disagreement that taxes like this may not even be taxes

Mr. McCardell, I understand the big

difference it makes in the bankruptcy context whether it's

it make any difference whether it's labeled excise or

provision that makes this particular excise tax

QUESTION:

There's some discussion in the

1

Is -- withholding taxes, that's -- is

2

that -- the corporation withholds its employees taxes,

3

then it doesn't pay them, and the person who owes the tax

4

is the employee, and the code refers to the money that the

5

corporation should have withheld, which, of course, is the

6

tax that the employee owed, as a penalty, is that right?

7

MR. McCARDELL:

8

QUESTION:

9

That's correct.

And that's the idea of pecuniary

penalties?
MR. McCARDELL:

10

It's what the Government would

11

have received if the law had been -- the tax that would

12

have been collected if the law had been obeyed.
QUESTION:

13

And so the only things that are

14

pecuniary penalties are these instances where a

15

corporation is to withhold a tax that somebody else owes,

16

and the code refers to that as a penalty, or those as

17

penalties?

18

MR. McCARDELL:

I can think of another example

19

of possible pecuniary loss penalty, and that is an

20

exaction under the Internal Revenue Code that simply

21

represents interest on a tax that should have been paid

It doesn't compensate any tax that was not collected.

3

Congress did not enact section 4971(a) with the idea that

4

individuals would not fund their pension plans and that

5

the IRS would then collect revenue.

6

Instead, it passed the statute with the idea

that individuals who had sponsored pension plans would

fund them, and that that funding would go to pay retirees.

QUESTION:

They're required to fund them?

MR. McCARDELL:

Yes, they are.

That's found in

section 302 of ERISA.
QUESTION:

Is there any other penalty for not

funding them?
MR. McCARDELL:

They -- there's no criminal

15

penalty, Your Honor, but that under section 502 of ERISA

16

the failure to fund may be enforced by a civil action,

17

including injunctive proceedings, so that it is a

statutory obligation which, if violated, gives rise to

these escalating penalties.

Now, in this case, the -- not only did the IRS

2

things being considered in this case, it makes sense for

the Court to adopt a rule which would reach that result.

4

We don't think, all other

Nothing in the statue requires that the court

5

read section 507 to require that any label in a

6

nonbankruptcy statute governs priority in bankruptcy.

7

The Court's cases, from the Embassy Restaurant

8

case, to the Nathanson case, to the Simonson case, all

9

clearly specify that the Court's mode of analysis over

10

many years has been to say that it's bankruptcy law that

11

establishes bankruptcy priorities, and labels or meanings

12

or understandings in nonbankruptcy statutes while,

13

perhaps, evidence, are not controlling.
That was the basis of the court of appeals

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JONES:

22

23

I have two brief points I want to

make.
The claim that a tax that effects a penalty

24

loses its priority was exactly what this Court rejected in

25

United States v. New York under the Bankruptcy Act.

The

1

Bankruptcy Code simply makes it easier to understand that

2

that's the correct answer, because knowing full well that

3

many of its excises are penalty or regulatory in nature,

4

Congress adopted an unqualified priority for excise taxes.

5

We have to establish only that it's an excise

6

tax.

Whether it's also regarded as a penalty is not

7

relevant for applying the plain language of the statute,

8

and the court held in United States v. New York it was not

9

relevant under the Bankruptcy Act.

10

The other ;point --

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, do you know whether it

12

makes any difference for the IRC purposes alone,

13

forgetting bankruptcy, whether something is labeled excise

14

or penalty, assuming -- forgetting about the

15

deductibility, because this one is not deductible.

MR. JONES:

You mean, in applying the excise tax

priority?

QUESTION:

19

MR. JONES:

20

QUESTION:

That -- no. No, not -I'm sorry.
Forget bankruptcy.

Just for the

purposes of the Internal Revenue Code, does it make any

22

difference whether something is labeled an excise tax or a

23

penalty?

I

1

hate to make categorical statements, but I'm not familiar

2

with any.

3

And the other point that I want to address very

4

briefly is the suggestion that this -- the priority for

5

this excise tax is unfair because it comes in front of

6

claims of employees for residual retirement benefits.

7

In saying that, the court of appeals looked at

8

only the cost of the tax, and utterly ignored its benefit.

9

These employees not only get the promise of insurance,

10
11

they get the fact of insurance.
The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation comes

12

in and pays benefits, guaranteed benefits.

are much better off with this guarantee system in effect,

14

including the priority tax, than they would be without it.
