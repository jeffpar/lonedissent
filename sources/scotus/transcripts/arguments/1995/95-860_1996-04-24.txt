ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL D. DONOVAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. DONOVAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case concerns the meaning of the phrase

12

"interest at the rate" in- Section 85 of the National Bank

13

Act, which was passed by Congress originally in 1864.

In

14

' particular, this case brings before the Court the question

15

of whether Congress intended "interest" and "rate" in that

16

section -- in that phrase to include some certain late

17

fees that are not measured by time or based upon an unpaid

18

balance or unpaid late payment,

19

contract laws, State laws governing liquidated damages

20

that regulate such late fees in a borrower's home State.

21

so as to preempt State

The briefs of the parties here, Your Honors,

22

have presented three contrasting views as to what Congress

23

meant when it used the phrase "interest at the rate" in

24

Section 85.

25

measured by time, based upon an unpaid balance.

In Petitioner's view, Congress meant a charge

In

1

Respondent's view, Congress meant all lending charges;

2

that is, all charges that have an impact upon the

3

borrower/lender relationship so as to affect the yield

4

that the lender receives from a loan.

5

There's a third contrasting view here, and

6

that's presented by the Government that has filed an

7

amicus brief in support of the bank in this case.

8

view, espoused by the OCC recently, is that "interest at

9

the rate" does not mean all lending charges, even though

That

10

it might have meant that at one point, but it means

11

something now or something less than all lending charges,

2

but the agency will tell us precisely what iivterest

3

charges are interest at the rate and what interest charges

4

are not interest at --

5

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Donovan, if -- if the term

6

"interest" is open to some interpretation, there either is

7

or is going to be, I gather, a comptroller's

8

interpretation of the term.

9
20

21
22

MR. DONOVAN:
QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Do we owe any deference to that,

where it will expressly include late fees?
MR. DONOVAN:

The question of deference to the

23

comptroller ought to be looked at initially by looking at

24

the Statute itself, to determine whether the Statute

25

itself addresses that, so as to whether there should be

1

any need to turn to the comptroller.

2

that there are at least four phrases in the Statute or in

3

the National Bank Act itself which give guidance to this

4

Court as to why neither deference is appropriate and why

5

"interest at the rate" mean -- means what Petitioner says

6

it means.

7

And here, we believe

First, Your Honors, is the phrase "interest at

8

the rate" itself.

Interest, both in 1864 and commonly

9

today, was conceived of a charge that was somehow

10

connected to the time during which money is received by a

11

borrower and the time in which it's paid back.

12

a charge that has some relationship to the amount of money

13

received by the borrower and

14

borrower would then have to return that amount.

15

It is also

-- and the time in which the

Another phrase that is in the Statute itself,

16

Section 85 of the National Bank Act, is found further down

17

in the Section, and it refers to a common type of lending

18

practice that was prevalent in the mid-1800's, and that

19

was the advance collection of interest on discounted

20

notes, where a borrower would tend -- tender his notes in

21

exchange for a currency, and the bank would discount that

22

note at the outset to collect interest.

23

QUESTION:

Upon that --

That's still done now, isn't it?

24

That -- that's not disappeared?

25

MR. DONOVAN:

No.

In fact, it still happens

today, Justice Scalia.

2

Section 85 was that you may collect interest in advance --

3

and I'll -- and using the words of this Statute,

4

"reckoning the days for which the note, bill or other

5

evidence of debt has to run."

6

common word today, but it was referring to some sort of

7

calculation of time and amount, reckoning the two.
QUESTION:

8

9

But what Congress allowed in

Now, reckoning isn't a

Well, that -- that shows that it does

include that kind of interest, the -- the normal kind, but

10

it doesn't show that it excludes the other kind.

11

trouble I have with your position, Mr. Donovan, is I don't

12

see how effective this provision in the Bank Act would be,

13

which was intended to be a usury provision, if it said

14

it's perfectly okay so long as you put in the loan

15

agreement "interest shall be 6 percent per year, plus $10

16

a week no matter what the outstanding balance is."

17

that would be wonderful usury, and it -- and it would not

18

at all be protected by -- protected against by Section 85.

19

I -- I cannot believe that that's what Congress intended.
MR. DONOVAN:

20

The

I mean

Well, taking your question,

21

Justice Scalia, as, Why -- why would Congress do something

22

like this?

23

Congress -- that's all they were asked to do.

24

they were focusing on doing in -- in terms of allowing

25

banks to charge a rate of interest that was tied to the

The -- the simple answer to that is that

bank's home State.
QUESTION:

2

So any bank could charge 10 bucks a

3

week on the outstanding balance?

4

MR. DONOVAN:

5

QUESTION:

Well, Congress --

Not -- not matter what the

6

outstanding balance was, you pay $10 a week to the bank;

7

they could do that under this provision?
MR. DONOVAN:

8

9

That -- Your Honor, that would be,

under our view of "interest," an interest charge.

That

10

would be a charge that would be based upon the outstanding

11

balance.

12

QUESTION:

Well, it's not based on --

13

MR. DONOVAN:

It would be a time-based charge.

14

It would not be based upon the outstanding balance.

Congress --

board, if the $10 did not vary based upon the outstanding

2

balance at all.

3

was focusing on rate ceilings, so that those rate ceilings

4

could be gauged, both by the borrower and the bank at the

5

outset, to determine whether there was compliance with the

6

usury ceiling.

And the reason why was because Congress

QUESTION:

7

Mr. Donovan, suppose that CitiBank,

8

instead of having a flat $15 a month late payment said the

9

late payment is 1 percent on arrears, but not less than

10

$15; would that then qualify as an interest rate?
MR. DONOVAN:

11

The -- let me see if I understand

12

the -- Your Honor's question.

13

QUESTION:

Instead of the $15 a month -- you're

14

in arrears, the $15 a month no matter what the balance is

15

-- instead, the provision is 1 percent, but not less than

16

15.

18

So it could be more, but it's going to be at least

MR. DONOVAN:

If the 1 percent, Your Honor, were

19

calculated on the amount of the late payment, not on the

20

entire outstanding balance of the revolving account.

21

the 1 percent, if it varied based upon time -- in other

22

words, it could have --

QUESTION:

It would.

Then

But for people who would

laws of the borrower State.

were something that was charged not on the late payment --

10

not on the outstanding balance, the aggregate balance, but

11

on the late payment balance itself, which are not the

12

facts here -- here we have a charge that's imposed by

13

CitiBank, calculable on the entire outstanding balance, so

14

that it's a flat charge, the .65 percent I'm referring to

15

-- but if the 1 percent were calculated on the late

16

payment amount, and that 1 percent accrued or ran, in the

words of this -- of this Court, then that would be an

interest charge.

It would not be something that would

MR. DONOVAN:

The -- the 50-cent charge that is

the minimum finance charge for when a borrower chooses to

MR. DONOVAN:

20

QUESTION:

21

Yes.

So it would be outside the Statute,

just as the $15 would be, isn't that right?

22

MR. DONOVAN:

The difference, Justice Souter,

23

would be that the $15-charge, if it is imposed looking

backward, based upon a default, as opposed to looking

forward, which is -- which is what the 50-cent charge is

-- the 50-cent charge is a charge that when you do not

3

minimum that you're going to have is -- is 50 cents.

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

5

MR. DONOVAN:

And that's a going-forward charge,

because it's anticipated that for each day that you

QUESTION:

10

But I -- I thought that interest

11

historically a payment for damages -- originally -- was a

12

payment for damages for the money that wasn't paid in

13

time.

14

question here fits very well within that definition.

15

your point that our understanding of interest or the

16

meaning of interest changed from, say, the 1700's to the

17

time when of the Civil War, when this statute was enacted?

18

And it seems to me that this charge that's in

MR. DONOVAN:

No, Justice Kennedy.

Is

Our point is

19

that the definition you identify, a charge for the use of

20

forbearance or detention of money, whereas damages of its

21

detention describes when interest may be charged.

22

doesn't describe what interest is.

23

what the components of interest are.

MR. DONOVAN:

The distinction, Your Honor, is

that here the flat charge is imposed in addition to a

measured by time and amount, which is accruing on the

3

Here, CitiBank could impose a greater interest charge, and

4

we don't dispute that.

5

on a payment, you must pay an additional 3 percent, so

6

that your interest rate will raise from 19.9 percent to

7

15.9 percent.

8

charge would then vary, depending upon how much the credit

9

card holder had and how much time was involved.

10

I am suggesting that it's a different type of

If CitiBank said, If you were late

What CitiBank may not do -- because that

What CitiBank may not do, though, is impose a

11

sum-certain charge that doesn't vary whether the payment

12

is $20 or $2,000, and it doesn't vary whether the payment

13

is 1 day late or 2 day -- 2 days late.

14

Your Honors, is the difference between -- if I -- if I may

15

focus on the words "rate" and "amount" in the statute that

16

Congress enacted.

17

between the words "rate" and "amount," and used the words

18

differently in Section 85.

The reason being,

Here, Congress envisioned a difference

19

When Congress was referring to rate, it was

20

referring to a charge that was reckonable, to use the

21

words of the Statute, over the number of days that the

22

note, bill or other evidence of debt were -- were

23

outstanding.

24

of Section 85, or the first part of Section 30, which

25

enacted both Section 85 and 86.

That word "rate" is used in the first part

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

The word "amount" is used in Section 86, and it

1

2

refers to a flat penalty-type of provision, an aggregate

3

sum, that's a -- a calculable sum.

4

the bank owes the borrower when the bank overcharges or

5

commits usury.

6

bank has to write a check and pay back to the borrower

7

when the bank violates the usury ceiling.

So an amount is a flat amount that the

The rate is a ratio -- just basic English -- is

8

9

And it refers to what

a ratio charge.

So, the difference that I am trying to

10

explain I -- hopefully -- is that the rate here --or the

11

charge here -- is not a rate charge.

12

that's imposed on a default.
QUESTION:

13

It's a flat amount

But you wouldn't object to a flat

14

amount as a ceiling, would you?

15

me that you would as a floor.

16

but never more than $50 a month; that would be okay, even

17

though the -- the $50 is a -- is a flat amount, as opposed

18

to what you call a rate?

Two percent of the arrears, but never

21

22

MR. DONOVAN:

Yes.

The -- the $50 a month,

23

again, would be a increment, but would not be an interest

charge.

It would be a penalty charge or a noninterest

charge.

And to respond to Justice Stevens' point about

the unit of time, in the Citizens Banks against Donnell

whether the method of calculation as to unit of time in

-- did the language allowed by the laws of the State in

In other words, did the

10

Section 85 adopt the manner in which the rate of interest

11

was to be calculated?

12

there was a dispute about how many cimes per year it was

compounded.

14

Because in that particular case,

And, Justice Stevens, I believe that the opinion

by Justice Holmes is very clear on this point, that the

question of the unit of time is up to the law of the State

17

where the bank is located.

1

and you could call everything interest, it would all fit

2

into your definition?

3

MR. KENDALL:

If -- if what Mr. Donovan is

4

saying is that our definition is inclusive of all charges

5

that are for the use or detention of money, then we would

6

say that that definition has a proud history in the usage

7

of the term "interest," the usage of the term "rate," the

8

statutory history, the statutory purpose, and the

9

administrative agencies' interpretation.

10

So we are not suggesting that charges that are

11

not for those purposes constitute interest, but we do --

12

we do believe -- and -- and this Court has -- has a

4

Because instead of compounding only once per year, which

was his analysis of what the State required as to the unit

6

of time, the bank had compounded oftener than that.

7

And the answer was, by Justice Holmes, yes.

And so I offer that -- that part of Donnell for

the proposition that the law of the State as to the method
