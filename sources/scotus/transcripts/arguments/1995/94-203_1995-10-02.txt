ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA SUSAN KARLAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MS. KARLAN:

8

9

Thank you.

Justice Stevens, and

may it please the Court:
This case presents the question whether

10

11

section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires a preclearing

12

method of nominating candidates for the United States

13

Senate that restricts the right to vote to persons who

14

give $45.

15

Under the facts of this case, if you don't pay

16

$45, you have absolutely no say in how the Republican

17

nominee for Senate in Virginia is selected.

18

Section 5 requires the preclearance of all

19

voting standards, practices or procedures, or

20

prerequisites to voting, no matter how small the change,

21

and was enacted to keep States and political parties from

22

denying the recently won gains in registration under the

23

Voting Rights Act.

24
25

In Presley v. Etowah County Commission, this
Court reaffirmed the broad scope of section 5, and

identified once again a series of categories or typologies

2

of case which require preclearance, and under the facts

3

alleged in our complaint, this case falls within two of

4

those typologies.
QUESTION:

5

Ms. Karlan, may I inquire, your brief

6

suggests possibly three different theories of why

7

section 5 might have been violated, and the first is that

8

the $45 fee affects the process of selecting the nominee,

9

and the second is that being a delegate to the convention

10

is an elective party office, and third is the threat that

11

the change from a primary election to a nominating

12

convention required preclearance.
Now, were either of those last two theories

13
14

contained in the complaint, and were they raised below?

15

Are they actually here, or do we just look at the $45 fee

16

question?

17

MS. KARLAN:

Well, Your Honor, they were

18

properly presented below.

19

came up on an expedited schedule with no discovery

20

permitted to the plaintiffs.

21

As Your Honor knows, this case

The result was that we found out when we

22

received the affidavit of David Johnson contained in the

23

Joint Appendix that the Republican Party had switched from

24

a primary to a convention, and that this fee effective --

25

this fee would only be possible were that change in there.

1

We then raised that issue at oral arguments --

2

QUESTION:

3

convention, was that -- it was not part of your complaint?
MS. KARLAN:

4
5

The change from a primary to a

No, Your Honor, it was not part of

our complaint.

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. KARLAN:

You talked about it.
That's correct.

Under our

8

complaint, the facts of which must be taken as true for

9

these purposes, we alleged that this was in effect a

10

primary election itself, because as we alleged, and the

11

district court assumed, anyone who pays $45 is entitled to

12

go and cast a vote for a nominee.
QUESTION:

13

Well, the court below did not deal

14

with those -- with the second and third so-called

15

theories?
MS. KARLAN:

16

No, Your Honor, it did.

It held

17

that nothing connected with the convention required

18

preclearance, not the imposition of a fee, not the rules

19

governing who could attend, and not the decision under

20

section --

21

QUESTION:

But do you think it dealt with the

22

issue of whether the change itself from a primary to a

23

convention required preclearance?

24
25

MS. KARLAN:

It said, Your Honor, that nothing

connected with the convention, including implicitly the

1

decision to hold one, is covered -QUESTION:

2

3

And certainly not expressly.

It

didn't expressly deal with that, did it?
MS. KARLAN:

4

No, Your Honor, but under Federal

5

Rule of Civil Procedure 15, we were entitled to conform

6

the pleadings to the proof, and had this case not been

7

done in the expedited manner in which it was done, we

8

could have amended the complaint.
Now, under Rule 15, the failure to amend the

9
10

complaint need not keep the Court from reaching that

11

issue.

12

If this Court concludes that that's the central

13

question, and that that issue wasn't sufficiently

14

developed, then the proper response from the Court would

15

be to reverse the judgment of the district court granting

16

the motion to dismiss, and remand for further proceedings

17

in which that issue can be expressly litigated.

18

Now, there are two theories of section 5 alleged

19

in the complaint under which, under the text of the Voting

20

Rights Act, this practice is covered.

21

is that the Republican Party's practices here, given the

22

facts alleged, constitute a primary in and of themselves.

23

The first of these

A primary election, after all, is an election in

24

which individual voters who are adherents of a political

25

party nominate a candidate by casting ballots.

QUESTION:

1

Ms. Karlan, may I ask you a

2

preliminary question -- at least, I think it's preliminary

3

to that.

4

The section that you're dealing with speaks of

5

"whenever a State or a political subdivision."

6

to be addressed to a State or a political unit of a State.

7

How, then, can you proceed under section 5 against a

8

political party?

9

MS. KARLAN:

It seems

Well, Justice Ginsburg, a political

10

party under the circumstances of this case is a State

11

actor in the same way that the Fifteenth Amendment by its

12

terms simply guarantees the right to vote against

13

abridgement or denial by a State, and has been held to

14

cover political parties when they're engaged in the public

15

nominating function.

16

QUESTION:

I can see that -- you -- you're

17

referring to constitutional -- decisions under the

18

Constitution like Terry and Smith v. Allwright, but here

19

we have a statute, and the statute addresses State or

20

political subdivisions.

21

words in the statute itself?

Is there any definition of those

22

MS. KARLAN:

There is no definition of State in

23

the statute itself, Your Honor.

24

terms specifically enacted to enforce the guarantees of

25

the Fifteenth Amendment, and thereby it seems clear from

The statute was by its

1

the legislative history intended to reach political

2

parties as well.

3

For example, we cite in our brief, Your Honor,

4

the statement from the House subcommittee of the Judiciary

5

that was responsible for the hearings on section 5 stating

6

directly an election of delegates to a State party

7

convention is covered, and a statement by Representative

8

Bingham, the author of the language defining the term

9

"vote" in section 14(c)(1), making clear that party

10

canvases and caucuses that selected people who were

11

involved in the nomination of candidates to public office

12

were covered by the act because they were State actors.

13

QUESTION:

Ms. Karlan, how can that be?

Can I

14

not follow a political party that -- say a feminist group

15

wants to start a women's political party.

16

be members.

17

candidates, but it's a women's party.

18

permitted under this legislation?

19

State simply because that party excludes men from

20

participating in the political party?

21

Only women can

Anybody in the world can vote for their

MS. KARLAN:

That's not

It's action by the

Your Honor, section 5 of the Voting

22

Rights Act would not cover the decision to form a party as

23

discriminatory on the basis of race, but the Nineteenth

Amendment --

QUESTION:

Their selection of a candidate.

1

Their selection of a candidate.

2

MS. KARLAN:

The Nineteenth Amendment, Your

3

Honor, would say that if that party performs the public

4

electoral function of nominating a candidate for United

5

States Senator, they would be covered by the Constitution.
QUESTION:

6

May I ask if the Virginia statutes

7

draw a distinction between new parties such as Justice

8

Scalia's feminist party, and established parties like the

9

Republican Party and the Democratic Party?

10

MS. KARLAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

Yes, Justice Stevens, but -What is the difference under Virginia

law?
MS. KARLAN:

Under Virginia law, a political

14

party within the meaning of the Virginia statute only

15

comes into being if at one of the last two Statewide

16

general elections some candidate of that party received

17

10 percent of the votes cast for Statewide office, so that

18

the party to which Justice Scalia refers would not itself

19

be covered.

However --

Ultimately, yes.

would have to be, I suppose, disbanded.
MS. KARLAN:

1

which is not at issue in this case, yes, Your Honor, which

2

says that no State shall abridge or deny the right to vote

3

on account of sex.

4

QUESTION:

Well, but the question is whether or

5

not this is a State or a political subdivision, and it

6

seems to me in light of the two cases Justice Ginsburg

7

mentioned, Terry v. Adams and Smith v. Allwright, that you

8

have a difficult position to maintain.

9

The Congress was well aware of those cases.

10

They were well aware of the White Primary cases, and yet

11

they used the words, State and political subdivision.

12

They didn't say, or any other entity which is a State

13

actor --

14

MS. KARLAN:

15

QUESTION:

16

you want us to say the latter.

17

MS. KARLAN:

Well, but --- and that's what you want -- and

Well, but Justice Kennedy, the

18

provision under which the exclusions in Terry and in

19

Smith v. Allwright were found discriminatory was a

20

provision that only applied to the States, so Congress

21

could reasonably assume that if it was State action for a

22

political party to bar someone from a preprimary in which

23

there was no governmental involvement whatsoever --

are correct.

I am assuming that State action cases

The point is, is that this jurisprudence was

1

in front of the Congress, and they chose this rather

2

limited language.

3

MS. KARLAN:

No, Your Honor, this language is

4

not limited.

5

courts held that political parties were covered.

This is the same language under which the

6

Now, Your Honor --

7

QUESTION:

The court held political parties were

8

covered in those cases when election as the nominee of

9

that political party was effectively election to the

10

office.

11

MS. KARLAN:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

No, Your Honor -That's quite a different situation

from what one has here.
MS. KARLAN:

No, Your Honor.

In United

15

States v. Classic, the case on which both Smith and Terry

16

rely, the court said that the primary was an integral part

17

of the election process whether it always, sometimes, or

18

never resulted in the election of a candidate.

19

QUESTION:

No question about that, but those

20

cases did not purport to be interpreting this language.

21

This statute was later enacted, and they did not focus on

22

the words, State or political subdivision.

23

about State action, of course.

24

MS. KARLAN:

25

They talked

Well, Your Honor, if I may draw a

historical point not in the record, in 1965, the States

1

that were covered by the Voting Rights Act were all States

2

in the solid South, which was solidly Democratic.

3

Congress passed a law with the understanding that you have

4

advanced, one that didn't apply to political parties, it

5

is patently clear that the Voting Rights Act would have

6

been strangled at its birth, because all of the

7

discrimination would simply have been conducted by the

8

Democratic Party in the South, and the Voting Rights Act

9

would have been a dead letter.

10

Had

Now, it's clear that that's so from both the

11

statement in the House report and Representative Bingham's

12

statement of what the language involving voting was

13

intended to cover.

14

QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Karlan, the Attorney

15

General has adopted a number of regulations pursuant to

16

section 5 and the provisions of the Voting Rights Act.

17

you concede that all the Attorney General's regulations

18

that are relevant here are valid?

19

MS. KARLAN:

I believe that they are all valid,

20

yes, Your Honor, and they do provide that when political

21

parties perform the State --

22

QUESTION:

Do

And you rely on those regulations to

make your case?
MS. KARLAN:

They certainly support our case,

but even if those regulations were invalid, our case would

1

go forward, because our claim is that this is a primary

2

election in the same way that the behavior in Terry is a

3

primary --

4
5

QUESTION:

Do you think that absent those

regulations, your position would be sustained here?

6

MS. KARLAN:

I would hope so, Your Honor.

7

I don't think our position depends on the

8

Attorney General's regulations.

His regulations are based

9

on the same understanding which we have advanced, which is

10

that State action covers a political party when it's

11

engaged in the process of nominating a candidate for

12

public office.

13

QUESTION:

Ms. Karlan, you say that this would

14

not have been -- it would have been a dead letter if it

15

couldn't have been applied against the Democratic Party in

16

the South in the era when it was enacted.

17

How many times was it applied against the

18

Democratic Party in the South?

19

MS. KARLAN:

Your Honor, I only have the list of

20

the number of times where objections were lodged, and that

21

was about a dozen.

There's a citation to the Turner

QUESTION:

MS. KARLAN:

10

12

QUESTION:

Just 12.
Yes, Your Honor.
Ms. Karlan, may I go back to the

textual argument?
You -- if I understand what you're saying,

13

you're saying that "State" is to be construed to include

14

anyone who exercises a State function.

15

winnowing candidates down is a State function, therefore,

16

it applies here.

The process of

Is that --

17

MS. KARLAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

18

QUESTION:

19

If that's the way the Congress intended the word

-- basically what you're saying?

20

State to be construed, why did it refer to political

21

subdivision at all?

22

Because it seems to me -- maybe I'm missing

23

something, but it seems to me that political subdivision

24

would be included on your definition without specific

25

reference to it, without the need for specific reference

to it, whenever it was engaged in -- in effect in

2

discharging any of the processes by which the State

3

government would ultimately bring an election or a series

4

of choices to be made in election before the people, so

5

why is it in there at all?
MS. KARLAN:

6

The reason it's in there, Justice

7

Souter, is because section 5 of the Voting Rights Act only

8

applies to particular places.
Sometimes those places are entire States, but in

9
10

some cases, like North Carolina or New York, only

11

particular political subdivisions, only particular

12

geographic regions --

14

MS. KARLAN:

15

Ah.

Ah.

-- are covered by the statute at

all.

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. KARLAN:

Okay.
So if you only provided no State,

18

it wouldn't define, for example, the preclearance cases

19

that this Court has seen from North Carolina or from New

8

MS. KARLAN:

That's correct.

9

The triggering provisions of section 4 identify

10

political subdivisions for purposes of deciding what's

11

covered by preclearance, not for purposes of deciding what

12

the standard is, or whom the actor is.

If there are no further questions, I'll --

QUESTION:

15

Under your view, if, in a covered jurisdiction,

16

there is a small group of citizens, two or three of them,

who have substantial community influence and many, many

funds, if they meet in someone's home to decide who's

going to be the candidate, and their voice is in effect

conclusive as to who will be the successful candidate in a

10 percent or more of the vote at an election is entitled

10

to place the candidate it selects for the U.S. Senate on

11

the ballot in a preferred position as long as the party

12

maintains a certain kind of organization prescribed by the

13

State.

14

The party is then entitled under Virginia law to

15

choose its candidate either through a primary, or through

16

a convention, or through some other means.

17

Both the district court and the appellees in

18

this case agree that if the party chooses to choose its

19

candidate through a primary election, that changes in the

20

rules about who can vote at that primary election to

21

choose the candidate are covered by section 5.

22

that's common ground.

2

Well, Mr. Bender,

I can understand an

argument to the effect that if the State permits a party

to change from a primary election to a convention method,

5

that that action by the State in allowing that change is

something that in and of itself could be challenged under

That question of whether that change was made

in -- it seems to me the basic principle here is that the

change in the people who can select a candidate to go on

election so that that change needs to be precleared, and

17

MR. BENDER:

11

I wouldn't say any change in the

think this case involves something that's very close to

the election process, and that is the people who can

If you affirm the decision of the district court

MR. BENDER:

MR. BENDER:

And as the Court said in Sheffield,

2

the concept of State and political subdivision are

3

territorial, and within that territory, every entity, as

4

Sheffield said, which would be the State under the Court's

5

State action principles -- and it's clear that a party in

6

this respect would be the State.

7

Every entity that would be the State is covered,

8

so the State is used in section 5 as the word State is

9

used in this Court's State action jurisprudence, not in

10

the formal sense of the State, and you can see that in the

11

Dougherty case, for example, where a school board put a

12

financial burden on an employee and said they had to take

13

a leave in order to run for election, and the Court held

14

that that had to be precleared.

Maybe we don't stop with the fee, but

maybe we start with the fee.
MR. GETCHELL:

If you -- if -- well, I would

5

suggest that you should not wish to start with the fee,

6

because I believe that you --

7

QUESTION:

8

10

Yes, but somebody does wish to start

with the fee -(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

-- and my difficulty with your

11

argument is that it seems to me quite possible, and in

12

fact even easy, to read the definition as covering this

13

particular requirement for the election of a party

14

official whose selection may have an effect on the

15

effectiveness of votes in the ultimate election.

16

And the fact that the application in this

17

instance may raise other questions about whether it

18

applies to the timing of these delegate selections and so

19

on is something to consider, but there's still the problem

20

of why, on its face, this does not apply.

21

MR. GETCHELL:

The ordinary rule of construction

22

of this Court is that if you are offered an interpretation

23

of the statute which raises grave constitutional issues,

24

you will avoid it unless you are compelled to that

25

construction by the clear intent of Congress.

And my point is, if you start with the fee, you

1

2

can never stop there, because the only intellectually

3

coherent grounds for saying that the fee is covered is to

4

say that the party is engaged in State action by the mere

5

act of nominating, and therefore the whole process is

6

ultimately federalized to the same extent it would be if

7

it were State action.
QUESTION:

8

9

Do we disregard the Attorney

General's rejection of that interpretation?

I thought the

10

Attorney General's interpretation were, things close to

11

the election of candidates like the $45 fee were covered

12

but things remote, like the time and the place of meeting,

13

like the formulation of the party's platform, were not

14

covered.

15

MR. GETCHELL:

Actually, the amicus brief,

16

Justice Ginsburg, filed by the Government acknowledges

17

that they do contend that the time, the place, the date,

18

are all covered.

Yes, I'm sorry.

finished?
MR. GETCHELL:

I was going to make the

5

additional point that it is too far down the road.

6

Remember, the whole purpose of section 5 was to freeze in

7

time in 1964 the practices that were potentially

8

discriminatory so that States wouldn't change them just as

9

fast as the courts struck them down.

10

Now, the remedy for section 5 is to go back to

11

where you were in 1964.

Party held its convention for this Senate seat in the John

13

Marshall Hotel, which is boarded up and closed, and it

held the next convention in the Hotel Roanoke, which is

QUESTION:

2

Are you saying, to go back for a

a Member of Congress, and suppose what you're concerned

about is that the major party, the Republicans or the

6

Democrats, say only white people can vote in our primary,

7

and that's terrible, and you want to make it illegal, and

8

probably the Constitution does.

9

And then the idea comes through, maybe what

10

they'll do is have a primary, they'll just call it a

11

convention, and they won't go into a voting machine,

12

they'll go meet somewhere.

judgment from this Court is a reversal and remand so that

2

we can conduct discovery on what the Virginia party

3

4

The second point I want to make is that the word

State is, of course, ambiguous.

It depends on a

construction of State that draws on the Fifteenth

to enforce.

The third point is about freedom of association.

4

Justice Scalia, your arguments would depend -- would be

5

equally strong in the context of a primary election.

6

the Republican Party wanted to hold a primary election

restricted to party members, and limit party membership to

white voters only, then your argument would say they have

that entitlement.

if it wasn't a State-run primary.
MS. KARLAN:

Honor, the freedom of association point might be the same

even if they did, and this court clearly has never taken

25

that broad an approach.

QUESTION:

I think the freedom to associate is

2

not the freedom to have the Government pay for your

association. I think once you get the Government in,

paying for the primary, it's a different situation.

5

MS. KARLAN:

6

Now, in this case, there is no freedom of

That's correct.

7

association claim, really, because if you look at the

8

Republican call for the convention contained in the Joint

9

Appendix, they allow all voters to participate.

The only

10

point they make is that they have some kind of interest in

11

charging the $45.

12

That may be so, but that interest will only be

13

trenched on by section 5 of the Voting Rights Act if the

14

Department of Justice, the United States District Court

15

for the District of Columbia, or this Court, concludes

16

that that practice of charging the $45 has the purpose or

17

effect of discriminating on the basis of race.

18

At this point, their claim has to be that they

19

would have the right to make people pay even if that

20

excluded all black voters, or a disproportionate number of

21

black voters.

22

Again, that is the issue to be determined in

preclearance.

they have identified that would be trenched on by

25

requiring preclearance in this case of this fee.

Precisely what does that consist of?
MS. KARLAN:

6

What is it here -- you keep saying

Under section 24.2-613 of the

7

Virginia Code, political parties receive placement on the

8

ballot above -- lexically above all other candidates, and

9

as Mr. Bender referred, there's a function called roll­

10

off, which means as you move down the ballot, fewer and

11

fewer people are still voting, and it turns out that being

12

the number 1 candidate or number 2 candidate on a ballot

13

gives you some substantial bump-up in the number of votes

14

you receive.

15

That's the preferential position.

The second preferential aspect is that the

16

parties need not show that this candidate has any

17

particular level of support, whereas any independent

18

candidate, or nonparty candidate running, must both gain a

19

percentage of the registered voters as signatories and

have those people spread across the Commonwealth.
