ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
From the earliest years of this Nation, Congress

13

has authorized the Government to seek parallel in rem

14

civil forfeiture actions and criminal prosecutions based

15

on the same underlying events.

16

Until recently, the pursuit of such parallel

17

actions was deemed to raise no question under the Double

18

Jeopardy Clause.

19

however, United States v. Halper and Austin v. United

20

States, prompted the courts of appeals in these two cases

*21

to conclude that the cumulative remedies of in rem civil

22

forfeiture and criminal prosecution violated the multiple

23

punishments doctrine under the Fifth Amendment.

24
25

Two recent decisions of this Court,

These holdings are incompatible with the long
tradition and practice in this country, and are incorrect

1

for four reasons.

2

categorically punitive within the meaning of the Fifth

3

Amendment, and the forfeitures in this case were not

4

punishment.

5

First, civil forfeiture is not

Second, an in rem forfeiture action is not a

6

jeopardy that can give rise to the protection of the Fifth

7

Amendment when the Government seeks to prosecute the owner

8

of the forfeited property for a criminal violation.

9

Third, civil forfeiture of property under 21

10

U.S.C. 881 is not the same offense as the criminal

11

prosecution of the owner of the property for having

12

violated the narcotics laws and, finally, parallel

13

contemporaneous civil forfeiture actions and criminal

14

prosecutions shall be deemed to constitute a single

15

proceeding within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment and

16

therefore not to violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.

17

Now, the overriding question that is presented

18

in both of these cases and in many others that are being

19

litigated in the lower courts is whether in rem civil

20

forfeiture should be deemed to be punishment.

21

courts below adopted a categorical rule that the

22

forfeiture that is accomplished by application of section

23

881 should be categorically deemed punishment.

25

QUESTION:

Both of the

Now, do you think, Mr. Dreeben, that

the civil forfeiture could be punitive for purposes of the

1

Excessive Fines Clause and yet not multiple punishment

2

within the meaning of double jeopardy?
MR. DREEBEN:

3

Yes, Justice O'Connor, I do.

The

4

question that this Court has considered in determining

5

whether civil forfeitures should be subjected to analysis

6

under the Excessive Fines Clause is really an issue of

7

whether it is sufficiently punitive to trigger the

8

threshold applicability of that clause, and this Court

9

held in the Austin decision that civil forfeiture does

10

have such a punitive component both historically and in

11

its contemporary applications, but civil forfeiture has

12

never been deemed so punitive when considered in light of

13

its simultaneous remedial aims as to constitute either a

14

prosecution or a punishment under the Double Jeopardy

15

Clause, and we submit that that is the correct analysis

16

here.

17

In Halper itself, the Court applied a case-byÂ­

18

case analysis to determine whether a particular sanction

19

applied in a particular case constituted an impermissible

20

punishment.

21

categorically civil forfeiture warrants analysis under the

22

Eighth Amendment does not dictate that all civil

23

forfeitures applied in all cases at all times should be

24

deemed punishment with the rather radical consequences

25

that were accomplished by the courts below.

The Court's conclusion in Austin that

QUESTION:

1

So you think Halper maybe could be

2

viewed as a multiple prosecution case and not a multiple

3

punishment case.
MR. DREEBEN:

4

I think that Halper, analyzed in

5

the terms that the Court analyzed it, was a multiple

6

punishments case, but it is nonethelessTtrue that under

7

Halper, there is some confusion about the exact test that

8

the Court adopted in that case due to different

9

formulations.
But our reading of Halper is that a sanction

10

11

that is rationally related and can be explained by

12

reference to underlying remedial purposes is not to be

13

deemed punishment for purpose of the Double Jeopardy

14

Clause even if there may be some element of punishment

15

associated with that sanction.

16

QUESTION:

17

And even though it's considered such

for purposes of the Excessive Fines Clause?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

19

QUESTION:

That is correct, Justice Scalia.

Why?

I can't understand why somebody

20

who would write a Constitution would think that a

21

punishment is a punishment for one purpose but not

22

another.

23

make it excessive, why isn't it punishment enough that you

24

shouldn't get it twice?

25

I mean, if it's punishment enough that you can't

MR. DREEBEN:

What policy reason is there?
The answer to that question goes

1

in part back to the roots and origins of the Double

2

Jeopardy Clause itself.

3

common law protections that were accorded to finality in a

4

criminal judgment, and they were accorded to the criminal

5

judgment in very specific contexts that this Court has

6

developed over time in a series of rather intricate and

7

complicated rules.
It has never been the case, though, that the

8

9

That clause was an embodiment of

pursuit of an in rem action against property and the

10

criminal prosecution of the owner of the property for

11

separate violations would be deemed to constitute an

12

impermissible multiple punishment.

13

QUESTION:

But you're saying -- I'm sorry.

14

QUESTION:

I say, I suggest that's only because

15

it was never applied to multiple punishments, period, of

16

any sort.

17

sure, but once we are on the track that double punishment,

18

as opposed to double jeopardy, is covered by the Double

19

Jeopardy Clause, I don't see why all punishment deemed

20

punishment by the Constitution shouldn't qualify.

21

I mean, greater includes the lesser, to be

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think the answer, Justice

22

Scalia, is that to the extent that there is protection

23

against multiple punishments that has been recognized in

24

this Court's cases as subsumed by the Fifth Amendment,

25

that protection has been limited and defined in very

1

specific contexts, and has never been a freestanding

2

doctrine that would invalidate any and all simultaneous or

3

contemporaneous pursuit of two actions that had some

4

punitive component to it.

5

And what the courts below did, I think, is take

6

to the absolute logical limits the principle that was in

7

part reflected in Halper, recognizing a prohibition

8

against multiple punishments, and have taken that

9

principle and extended it so that it overrides very

10

familiar common law practices that were well known to the

11

Framers and that have been reflected throughout the

12

history of this country --

13

QUESTION:

But isn't the different with, or at

14

least a difficulty with the historical argument that

15

you're making that some of the forfeiture in this case, or

16

in these cases, just do not have common law pedigrees?

17

It's one thing, for example, perhaps to forfeit a vehicle

18

on the theory that it stands in the same, or is in the

19

same position of, you know, the boat that was used for

20

smuggling and so on?

21

It seems to me quite another thing, though, to

22

apply that same rule and to invoke history to apply the

23

same rule when we're talking about the forfeiture of all

24

equity in a house that was used to dry some marijuana, and

25

so I don't see how your historical argument, even if I

1

accepted it, could get you all the way through these

2

cases.
MR. DREEBEN:

3
4

I agree, Justice Souter, that

history is not the entire answer to this problem.
To take, for example, the issue of proceeds

5
6

forfeitures, which are authorized underftitle 21 and were

7

not part of the common law of forfeiture, we are not

8

claiming here that the historical pedigree of forfeiting

9

the proceeds of crimes is what explains why that

10

forfeiture is not punishment.
It's our submission that, analyzed as a matter

11

12

of reason and logic, and in light of the common law

13

principle that unjust enrichment included gaining funds or

14

moneys through illegal means, and that it was not a

15

punishment to take those profits away from the wrongdoer,

16

we

17

QUESTION:

But Mr. Dreeben, if we stick with the

18

house where marijuana was dried, I thought, based on your

19

answer to Justice O'Connor, that you would say that should

20

be treated the way Austin was treated, as an excessive

21

fine case, but doesn't belong -- wasn't that the problem

22

in Austin, that what was --

23

MR. DREEBEN:

Right, that's correct.

I think in

24

Austin all forfeitures of facilitating property, property

25

that can be used to facilitate or to commit a crime, are

1

subject to analysis under the Excessive Fines Clause

2

because the Court concluded that they represent some

3

punishment to the owner of the property at least in part,

4

but the Court did not conclude that all forfeitures that

5

are accomplished of facilitating property, or all

6

forfeitures that are carried out under Chese statutes,

7

will be punitive such that that is the only explanation

8

for the sanction, which is the test in Halper.
QUESTION:

9

Okay.

How about applying the house

10

example, though, as it were, to Justice Scalia's question?

11

I take it we really don't have a historical pedigree that

12

we can rely on there.

We've got a kind of forfeiture that goes

Why, in a case like that, should it be

16

punishment for excessiveness purposes or potentially

17

punishment for excessiveness purposes but not for double

18

jeopardy purposes?

19

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, let me first put in the

20

historical context the forfeiture of facilitating property

21

and apply it to the real estate in this case.

22

The common law recognized in a wide variety of

23

contexts the potential for forfeiting property that was

24

used in the commission of a crime, and your example of

25

boats that were used for importing goods without

many, many others.

3

There were

At least since 1868, however, Congress has

4

provided for by statute the forfeiture of real estate that

5

was involved in the commission of crimes particularly with

respect to failure to pay tax on liquorr

7

QUESTION:

Well, that may be, but that doesn't

8

help you out, I think, in a historical argument, which

9

essentially is they understood at the time these clauses

10

were enacted as part of the original Bill of Rights that

11

there could be both these procedures, the criminal

12

prosecution and the forfeiture.

13

Once you get into sort of later statutory

14

amendments, whether its 1878 or 1978, that argument goes,

15

and it seems to me that's the point at which Justice

16

Scalia's question attains a very sharp focus.

17

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I don't think the argument

18

completely goes, Justice Souter, because the same

19

rationales and justifications for the forfeiture of

20

property that is used to facilitate a crime also are

21

present in the forfeitures of property that were known to

22

the common law, and the fact that the principle is being

23

applied in the new context to respond to new problems that

24

the common law hadn't faced does not mean that it is

25

something that would be unfamiliar to the Framers, and I

Was that under a civil forfeiture, or -MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, that was under a civil

forfeiture, and what that led to was this Court's decision

10

in Various Items v. United States in 1931, in which the

11

Court examined a claim that's virtually indistinguishable

12

from the claim that's being made here today that the

13

forfeiture of property following a criminal conviction of

14

the owner of property constituted a violation of the

15

Double Jeopardy Clause, and the Court rejected that

16

contention by reference to the very ancient traditions of

17

in rem forfeiture which had been recognized by this Court

18

in a variety of cases such as the Palmyra and the Brig

19

Malek in the 19th Century, that that supported the

20

treatment of such forfeitures as not sufficiently punitive

21

as to trigger the Double Jeopardy --

QUESTION:

Would the excessive fines analysis of Austin

6

MR. DREEBEN:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

Could the owner of the property say,

8

this is excessive because, what, you are punishing the

9

other person --

10

MR. DREEBEN:

11

QUESTION:

Well --

-- excessively, or you're punishing

12

me excessively compared to what the use of the property

13

was?

14

MR. DREEBEN:

This Court has not articulated

15

what the proper test or measure of excessiveness is under

16

the Eighth Amendment.

17

the proper approach to analyzing that question is as

18

stated in Justice Scalia's concurrence in Austin.

19

to look at the depth and extensiveness of involvement of

20

the property in the offense.

21

QUESTION:

The Government's position is that

Namely,

But my question is, do we apply that

analysis at all to the owner who's not guilty of a crime

-- assuming that culpability is

3

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that that is the necessary

4

consequence of Austin, that there is Eighth Amendment

analysis that can be invoked at the behest of the owner of

6

the property, who is the only one who has any real

7

property stake in the forfeiture itself, and that that

Even though that owner did not commit

That's correct.

That's correct.

Well, the purpose of the forfeiture, both

historically and as applied today, is in rem.

14

action against the property, and the theory of it is that

15

the property has been used sufficiently substantially in

16

the commission of the offense such that forfeiture is

17

justified for three historical reasons that are equally

18

applicable here.

19

It is an

The first is that it does encourage property

20

owners to take care in the use of their property.

second is that the forfeiture can serve to abate a

injured parties.

these violations of the law is the Government itself.

That's correct.

In this country

there was no tradition of criminal forfeiture, criminal in

The major difference in these kinds of actions

is that the in rem action brought civilly is against the

MR. DREEBEN:

We do not.

We have extensively

14

because the double jeopardy problems that have surfaced as

come into the case and attempt to establish either that we

haven't shown probable cause, or that they have an

innocent owner defense, but civil forfeiture enables us to

5

move in in situations where we really don't know who the

owner is.

7

For example, if we break up a substantial drug

we do not have a good faith basis to go to a grand jury

and say, we think that this individual is the owner of the

property and that we should include a count in the

We can't do that at all through criminal forfeiture

Criminal forfeiture helps us largely at the end

of the process, when it can truly be imposed as a

about the purposes and the history, and this Court's

2

cases, you are essentially covering the issue, but it's

3

not to be lost sight of that this Court, said as recently

as the Bennis decision that deterrence is an aim distinct

5

from any punitive purpose, and it has always been true in

6

civil forfeiture law that deterrence has been a recognized

7

purpose and aim.

9

In the Brig Malek decision in 1844, Justice
Story, describing the purposes of civil forfeiture, said

10

that it was to suppress a wrong or offense, and to provide

11

indemnity to the injured parties, and those purposes are

12

equally parallel to this case.

changes things, so -- but you didn't mention that as one

13

of the reasons for the forfeiture is to stop the use of

14

the facilities by the person who will then be prosecuted.

15

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I meant to do that, Justice

16

Ginsburg, in stating that it serves the traditional

17

purpose of abating a nuisance, of preventing the ongoing

18

commission of the crime, which is quite similar to what

19

this Court described as the purpose of the forfeitures in

20

Bennis, and was quite similar to the purposes of the

21

forfeitures that were imposed in the common law era, and

then later pursuant to statutes in this country.

MR. DREEBEN:

2

QUESTION:

Well, I -- that's right.

You're not putting anything out of

3

commission there.

I suppose your argument on the proceeds

4

case -- I didn't mean to get into this, but I suppose your

5

argument in the proceeds case is something akin to

6

contraband that you don't have a right f- no one should be

7

deemed constitutionally to have a right to proceeds of

8

criminal activity, and therefore when you take it away

9

that should not be regarded as punishment.
MR. DREEBEN:

10

Exactly right, Justice Souter, and

11

although that had not been traditionally accomplished

12

through forfeiture, it had been traditionally recognized

13

as no issue under the Fourth Amendment whatsoever for the

14

Government to seize the proceeds that a robber derives

15

when he goes into a bank and comes out with money.
QUESTION:

16

But that's different from the drug

going to give the money back to the bank, as Justice

1

restoring the proceeds to society, but that is not like

2

restitution, and I just think the analogy is closer to the

3

contraband than it is to restitution.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that both analogies work,

5

although the concept that I was trying to describe is that

6

of simply that depriving the wrongdoer of the ill-gotten

7

gains that he has derived from criminal activity is not

8

punishment.

QUESTION:

If it's not punishment, then does

that mean it's not for an offense?
MR. DREEBEN:

It could be conceived of as not

being for an offense, but I think -QUESTION:

Or is the better argument that it's

not the same offense?
MR. DREEBEN:

I think that strictly speaking, as

18

proceeds, the reason why it's not punishment is that the

19

owner of money derived from crime has no right to retain

20

them at all.

21

But it is also our position that, even if one

22

takes this as a straightforward Blockburger case and

23

applies normal double jeopardy rules, that the in rem

The question, then, that has to be asked is,

7

what do we have to prove in an in rem action in order to

8

sustain our burden of taking the property with respect to

that individual, and the answer is nothing.

We do not

have to prove that that person engaged in a crime or did

anything wrong.

13

All we have to do is show that the

And so to take the facts of this case, where

14

Mr. Ursery and his wife and his son were all

15

coconspirators in manufacturing marijuana, we could have

16

taken the property in our forfeiture action based on his

17

son's activities, without proving anything as to him, and

18

there is therefore no necessary requirement that we prove

any culpable action or any state of mind as to the owner

of the property in the in rem action.

The difficulty I have with it is that that

doesn't seem to be the way the Court analyzed the problem

in Brown and Ohio, because in Brown and Ohio, if -- the

Court in effect said, well, you look to the way it was

proved in this case, and in this case it was the owner of

the property, and in fact all of the elements except for

16

the further additional element that is raised by the

If we follow a Brown and Ohio kind of double

jeopardy analysis, then I think we have to go the other

way.

21
22

23

MR. DREEBEN:

I think Brown v. Ohio, Justice

Souter, really addresses a quite distinct problem.
In a Brown v. Ohio situation, the Government is

24

necessarily going to have to prove that the defendant in

25

that case committed some felony which was then aggravated

1

by the death resulting, and as a result the crime is

2

called felony murder.
And this Court's holdings is that, even though

3
4

felony murder subsumes all of the different felonies that

5

that defendant may have committed, it doesn't matter which

6

one the Government proves, it's as if there are as many

7

separate crimes in the criminal code as there are

8

predicate felonies, each one aggravated if death results.
Whereas in the civil forfeiture case, we never

9
10

have any burden of proof with respect to the owner of the

11

property, the person who is supposedly punished by this

12

"offense," and as a result, it seems very strange to say

13

that it is a -- the same violation that would be proved by

14

the Government in a criminal case brought specifically in

15

personam against that defendant.
QUESTION:

16

But Mr. Dreeben, isn't that only half

17

of the Blockburger test?

18

an element that's necessary to be proved in the criminal

case, but what does the criminal case include -- I mean,

enough, in this very case Ursery's criminal conviction

arose out of his manufacture of marijuana on somebody

That's simply on the facts of this very case,

The more fundamental reason why we think that it

1

2

is inappropriate to regard the forfeiture as a greater

3

offense which can preclude a subsequent criminal

4

prosecution is that that turns the entire notion of what a

5

greater offense is on its head.
Normally, when the GovernmentPbrings a criminal

6

7

charge for a greater offense and fails to prove the

8

additional element that makes it a greater offense, the

9

court can reduce a conviction to the crime of the lesser

10

offense, or the jury could be instructed to return a

11

verdict on the lesser ..of fense.
That plainly cannot happen in any case in which

12

13

the Government brings a civil in rem forfeiture action,

14

and it underscores the oddity of characterizing civil

15

forfeiture as a greater offense that can have this very

16

dramatic consequence of barring any criminal prosecution

of the property's owner based on the same underlying

facts.

And finally, I would like to return again to the

20

fact that we do also argue that the two proceedings that

21

were brought in each of the cases before the Court were

22

sufficiently contemporaneous so that they should not be

23

viewed as successive proceedings that invaded any

24

legitimate expectation of finality that the defendants in

25

these cases have.

1

When this Court in Halper prescribed a new rule

2

that had not really been recognized in any prior case law

3

that forbid multiple punishments from being pursued in

4

separate proceedings by the Government, it explained that

5

the reason why two proceedings is important is that it was

6

to prevent the Government from seeking the second sanction

7

because it was dissatisfied with the outcome of the first.

8

That cannot be said of any of the proceedings in

9

these cases.

The Government in the 405 case out of the

10

Ninth Circuit brought the criminal indictment and the

11

civil forfeiture complaint within 5 days of each other.

12

It brought the civil forfeiture complaint in the Sixth

13

Circuit case within 4 months of the criminal prosecution,

14

and the civil forfeiture action was settled by Mr. Ursery

15

before he went to trial on the criminal offense.

16

The Government clearly had made evident its

17

intent to seek both of these familiar, traditional,

18

parallel remedies against the defendants from the very

19

outset of these proceedings, and the defendants never

20

could have had any expectation that they would not be

21

subject to the full range of authorized sanctions that

22

were provided in Federal law.

What about the argument that the

24

other side made that if that is a sound argument you could

MR. DREEBEN:

In a criminal case what would

emerge to prevent that is the protection against

successive prosecutions.

MR. DREEBEN:

1

Justice Souter, the Court's

2

conclusion in Austin that civil forfeiture was

sufficiently punitive to be judged under the Eighth

Amendment specifically and explicitly recognized that

5

civil forfeiture was not and never had been recognized as

6

a criminal proceeding.

T

If it was, we would have a very serious double

8

jeopardy problem, but it would have been one that the

9

Framers themselves had dictated in statutes that were

10

enacted shortly after the Constitution and shortly after

11

the Bill of Rights, and that had escaped everyone's notion

12

for 200 years until United States v. Halper came down.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Two decades ago Congress passed really what was

19

the first ever proceeds forfeiture statute, and before

20

this time, forfeitures were handled either against

21

contraband in a remedial fashion because the item was

22

either inherently dangerous or its use was criminal in and

to facilitate a crime.

gained from its transaction or money that's merely

intended to be used for the transaction.

Nevertheless, there are similarities, and I

5

wanted to start with those.

6

forfeiture statutes, the 1978 proceeds statute was labeled

7

civil, and it invoked a fiction of in rem jurisdiction,

8

and this Court has provided us with clear direction in the

9

last decade what we do with those labels and what we do

10

with those fictions.

MR. FINER:

Yes, I can.

The Government argued

21

just moments ago at the podium that the decision in the

punitive as to invoke double jeopardy, and that is not the

holding of Various Items.

of that, in your opinion.
MR. FINER:

2

I think what we make of that is,

when we have a statute such as the one used in Halper,

which was the False Claim Act, that dates from roughly

5

1863, a Civil War era action to deter and punish those who

6

might excessively defraud the Government, and in that case

7

the Court did not have a historical precedent to look at.
This was not historical forfeiture.

This was a

brand new statute, and in that setting, Justice, the Court

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

six plots of marijuana plants about 250 to 150 feet

10

outside the premises of his property, a 10-acre home in

11

rural Michigan.
He harvested the plants, processed them, and

12

13

apparently smoked them in his house, and that was his

14

offense, and for that offense of manufacturing

15

marijuana -- which, by the way, does not turn on whether

16

it was on another piece of property.

17

at title 21 and you will find that it does not turn in the

18

slightest on the fact that it was on another piece of

19

property.

20

You can take a look

For that offense, he was first subjected to a

21

forfeiture of half the equity in his property under

22

881(a)(7), the very statute this Court construed in

23

Austin, which permits the forfeiture of property used to

24

commit a narcotics felony.

2

single count prosecution, which again charged the

3

manufacture of marijuana, precisely the predicate in the

881(a) (7) forfeiture.

5

6

This time he was convicted and

The Sixth Circuit held that the civil forfeiture

7

under 881(a)(7) was punishment, the prosecution was a

8

second punishment, and it was for the same offense and in

9

a separate proceeding, and accordingly was barred by the

In what cases subsequent that have

distinguished Various Items would you -- are you referring

11

MR. ROBBINS:

12

Well, no, I think quite the

13

contrary.

14

revisit Various Items and tell us whether it's

15

distinguishable or it's not, but I'm prepared to do so,

16

because it seems to me that what Various Items tells us is

17

that where a forfeiture, as in Various Items, does not

18

turn in the slightest on the innocence of the owner of the

19

property, then, in that event, it's a civil forfeiture

20

which cannot -- to which one cannot ascribe a punitive

dimension.

22

I don't think this Court has had occasion to

But of course, my statute, 881(a)(7), has an

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, surely that is a point of

is that the only

7

thing that makes this statute punitive.

8

not -- it was only one of several factors that the Austin

court, in a portion of its opinion that wasn't fact-

Indeed, it was

unanimous, concluded turned 881(a)(7), my statute, the

11

statute under which Mr. Ursery's property was forfeited,

12

into punitive -- into a punitive sanction.

13

But apart from that, I think it's also the case,

14

Justice Ginsburg, if I may, that Various Items was decided

15

in an era in which the fiction of in rem proceedings was

16

taken, if I may say so, more seriously, and given a sort

17

of -- a treatment that sort of abstracted away from the

18

fact that there is a real person whose property is being

taken, and I think frankly Various Items might not come

20

out the same way if viewed in the light of certain of this

Court's decisions since then that have said --

Like Bennis?

23

MR. ROBBINS:

To me,

1

Bennis is a question of whether the Due Process Clause

2

requires, as a substantive matter, that an owner of

3

property have an innocent owner defense, and the Court,

4

you know, hearkening back to the long line of cases, said

5

that it's not required, but when it's present, surely

6

that's some indication that you have a punitive sanction.

7

QUESTION:

That seems to me very strange that

8

you would say that a statute that is trying to be modern

9

have an innocent owner exception gets you into the double

10

jeopardy bind, but if it's like the Bennis statute that

11

didn't give you that exception, then you're -- then the

12

Government is okay.

MR. ROBBINS:

17

QUESTION:

-- in the statute that --

In answer to Justice Ginsburg, what

18

the other being -- look, the QED analysis, formal

19

analysis, Various Items deals with instrumentalities,

20

Halper didn't deal with instrumentalities,

21

instrumentalities have a pedigree historically, the other

22

didn't, and therefore the other cases deal with excessive

23

punishment, not double jeopardy, so draw the dots, follow

24

the dots, it's never been overruled, and that's the end of

the instrumentalities.

QUESTION:

My --

Well --

You're going to make, which is what I

want to hear.

9

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, not -- I think the answer is

10

that 881 (a)(7) has a variety of features that render it

11

punitive.

12

tied to the commission of an offense, it embodies the word

13

violation and, just as this Court referred to in One 1958

14

Sedan, where the requirement to prove illegality was what

15

persuaded the Court in that case to imply the Fourth

16

Amendment exclusionary rule to an otherwise civil

17

forfeiture, is also present here.

18

Apart from innocent owner, the fact that it is

The fact that the forfeiture under 881(a)(7) has

19

such a -- it has sort of random relationship to the

20

underlying harm, a point this Court made several times in

21

Austin, the fact that what you forfeit may bear only the

22

mere -- a mere happenstance relationship to the social

23

cost -- if you have the Taj Mahal on your property, it is

24

entirely forfeited, or if you have a hobo's hovel on your

cases -- U.S. Coin and Currency, the opinion for the Court

by Mr. Justice Harlan said, you know, again, if there is a

That is not a hypothetical case.

They had no warrant, they had no

When the court said, sorry, tlfe Fourth Amendment

applies to that, it by no means said, and you can't,

really quite odd to say that something that we have --

years of history, and a whole Prohibition era where this

was standard operating procedure.

MR. ROBBINS:

QUESTION:

They can be, and I suppose --

Can you give me an example of where

10

they are -- where somebody other than the Government

imposes a judgment for punitive damages?
MR. ROBBINS:

12

Well, obviously, in the final

analysis, it's imposed by virtue of a judgment enforceable

by a court, so I suppose under a sort of Shelley and

QUESTION:

Or you're trying not to.

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. ROBBINS:

I mean, I have the sufficiently

4

difficult burden of trying to persuade the Court that this

5

is punishment for all the reasons that it unanimously held

6

it was punishment in Austin, and I guess, you know, for

7

want of a better talisman, I recur to the point that every

8

reason the Court advanced for calling it punishment in

9

Austin is present here.

It's the same statute, it's the

10

same facts, and let me say, my case happens to illustrate

11

exactly why it's punishment.

12

QUESTION:

But the question is whether or not

13

it's the same offense.

MR. ROBBINS:

Those are the terms that appear in

the Double Jeopardy Clause, and if --

QUESTION:

The Government gave a hypothetical

19

something along the lines, if you have Smith and Jones in

20

Smith's car, and they're both dealing in marijuana, you

21

can convict the nonowner for the criminal offense, and

22

it's completely different elements in order to forfeit, in

order to forfeit the automobile.

offense question.
MR. ROBBINS:

2

And I think we can -- I think we

3

meet, we amply meet the Blockburger standard, and that a

4

lot of the arguments that I've heard this morning really

5

have nothing to do with Blockburger at all.
The fact is that 881(a) (7) incorporates

6

7

precisely the antecedent predicate act, because it

8

requires the proof of a violation.

9

by the statute.

That is the word used

The fact that you can prove a forfeiture

10

by showing that someone else did it strikes me as

11

ultimately begging the question.
The question is, this person has been punished

12

13

twice, forfeited on the one hand, convicted and sentenced

14

on the other, and now the Blockburger inquiry is, was it

15

for the same offense, safter all you need to look, as

16

the Court did in Whalen, Harris v. Oklahoma, and I would

17

suggest United States v. Dixon as well, at the elements

18

and ask, are they the same?
The fact is, 881(a)(7) couldn't be plainer that

19
20

it is embodying all of the elements of the underlying

21

violation.

22

Let me just say again, the suggestion by the

23

Government this morning, which I suspect they will disavow

24

on rebuttal, is that somehow the manufacturing charge

25

required proof that it was done on a neighbor's land.

I just thought that they

MR. ROBBINS:

It charged on or about a

Right.
-- which was, of course, a day

15

selected from within the 2-year period for which he'd

16

already had suffered a forfeiture, so it's -- I mean, it's

17

not a different day in any meaningful sense, and let me

18

say that if you read the record of the forfeiture

19

proceeding and the prosecution, you will find that the

20

forfeiture and the prosecution both turned on growing

21

marijuana off the premises, professing and smoking it on

22

the premises -- same facts, same theory, same witnesses,

23

same --

24
25

QUESTION:

Yes, but it may be that they needed

different elements for the two different offenses.

In

1

other words, they did not have to prove what happened in

2

the house to forfeit what happened elsewhere, and vice

3

versa.
MR. ROBBINS:

4

Well, it sounds at that point,

5

Justice Stevens, that one is almost getting into the Grady

6

and Corbin problem of turning on particular pieces of

7

evidence.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, that's what Blockburger itself

was, too.
MR. ROBBINS:

10

Well, I think we are -- we are

11

relying specifically on the elements, and again, to go

12

back to a question that Justice Scalia put, I believe,

13

perhaps to my cocounsel, this really is, in my view, just

14

like Whalen and Harris v. Oklahoma.
Yes, it's true, you could prove the forfeiture

15
16

by showing a different underlying crime.

17

money laundering, you could show possession with intent to

18

distribute, but in this case, what they charged was

19

forfeiture based on manufacturing, and what they charged

20

in the indictment at Joint Appendix page 28 was

21

manufacturing as an offense, and this is in a sense a

22

compound crime that has a variety of predicates, just as

23

this Court said in Whalen.

you're disbarred first and you're fined -- it usually

happens the other way around, but it could be that the

longer a member of the State bar, and you've had to pay a

MR. ROBBINS:

1

Well, if it's -- you know, if it's

an extreme enough fine, I suppose it would raise a

question under Halper as to whether it is so wildly

disproportionate that it really is the rare case.

No, no --- but if it's the same --

MR. ROBBINS:

If it's the same sovereign, my

position is that unless the fine is so disproportionate as

to violate Halper, it's a classic, it's a form of

liquidated damages even if it's not, you know, more -- any

better than rough justice.
