JUSTICE STEVENS:

We'll hear argument in Case

Number 94-1340, Citizens Bank of Maryland v. Strumpf.
Mr. Walker, you can proceed when you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING E. WALKER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. WALKER:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

it please the Court:
This case presents a single issue involving the

11

interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code, and that issue is

12

whether a bank creditor may refuse a debtor depositor's

13

request to withdraw funds pending a Bankruptcy Court's

14

determination of the bank's right of setoff without

15

violating the automatic stay.

16

The Court's answer to this question should

17

govern the conduct of nonbank and bank creditors alike,

18

including the United States Government.

19

The Fourth Circuit held that the bank's refusal

20

to allow the debtor to withdraw funds to the extent of the

21

bank's setoff right, what is referred to commonly as an

22

administrative hold, is tantamount to a setoff.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Walker, would you mind telling me

what your definition is of a setoff?
MR. WALKER:

Yes, Your Honor.

Justice O'Connor,

1

a setoff occurs when there is an intention to effect a

2

settlement of mutual debts.

3

One is that the creditor intends to do it.

It has several attributes.

Two, there is an affirmative action which

4
5

results in a bank account balance actually being reduced

6

in a corresponding amount.

7

and there is invariably a record evidencing that the

8

setoff occurred.
QUESTION:

10

The bank's claim is reduced,

Is this a matter of Federal law or

State law for purposes of this case?
MR. WALKER:

11

Your Honor, I believe it is a

12

matter of Fed -- excuse me.

13

State law consistent with Justice Breyer's view when he

14

was with the First Circuit in the Saugus General Hospital

15

case, that in determining when a setoff occurs,

16

consistent --

MR. WALKER:

QUESTION:

We look to State law.
Yes, Your Honor, and there is -There's no overall Federal meaning of

that term for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.
MR. WALKER:

21
22

I believe it is a matter of

I do not believe there is, Your

Honor.

The Federal Bankruptcy Code, of course,

24

determines what conduct is permissible under the code, and

our view is that administrative hold is expressly

1

permitted under section 542(b).
QUESTION:

2

And as a matter of State law in this

3

instance, you think that it depends on the bank's

4

intention?

5

MR. WALKER:

More than that, Your Honor.

6

Intention would be one factor.

7

First, I should point out there is no Maryland

8

reported case expressly telling any of us exactly when a

9

setoff occurs, and therefore we look to the general common

10

law and the Federal cases considering nonbankruptcy and

11

State law have generally agreed, at least at the circuit

12

court level and below, with our view of the case, namely

13

that there needs to be an intent, there needs to be an

14

affirmative act to change the status quo, and that's a key

15

point in our case, Your Honors.

16

An administrative hold, consistent with the

17

purpose behind the automatic stay, accomplishes a

18

preservation of the status quo, and that's quite --

QUESTION:

Well, the status quo was changed

1

quo which is most important, Your Honor, is the status quo

2

immediately prior to bankruptcy and the status quo

3

immediately after bankruptcy, and the answer to that

4

question is determined by looking at the depositor's right

5

to withdraw funds under its contract with the bank.
QUESTION:

6

Well, wait.

I thought you said that

7

whether a setoff has occurred depends upon whether there

8

has been a change in the status quo, that there has to be

9

some change in the status quo.

10

MR. WALKER:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WALKER:

13

QUESTION:

14

That is certainly a factor, yes.
Okay.
Where you would -All I'm saying is that that factor

existed here, didn't it?

15

MR. WALKER:

No, Your Honor, because the way I

16

would measure the change is looking at the debtor's rights

17

prior to bankruptcy to withdraw funds.

18

conditioned by contract in Maryland law by the bank's

19

right to set off the account upon default.
QUESTION:

20

That right was

Yes, but the bank has still gone one

21

step beyond that, because the bank has exercised the

22

right.

23

said, you can't take the money out, and it hadn't said

24

that beforehand.

25

That is a change in the status quo.

The bank has

2

have a perfectly reasonable position.
I don't know whether I'm going to ultimately

3

agree with it or not, but it seems to me that you've got

4

to say that the bank's -- or concede that the bank's act

5

in instituting the freeze is, in fact, an act that goes

6

beyond mere status quo.

7

reading offends some of these statues.

8

9

It's an act which on a literal

And it seems to me that your best argument is to
say, well, it just offends them a little bit, and it

10

offends them only to the extent necessary to make sense of

11

this equally valid statutory recognition of the right to

12

set off, that if you don't allow this, the right to set

13

off recognized in the code is nonsense, and try to

14

reconcile, rather than to say, well, the bank is

15

absolutely Simon-pure at all times, and it never literally

16

violates a thing.

17

It seems to me that that is a more plausible

18

position than to say that, here, for example, the freeze

19

does not affect the status quo.

20

MR. WALKER:

Justice Souter, I agree with your

21

view of it.

strength of our case, and namely that section 3 --

MR. WALKER:

2

QUESTION:

I welcome it.

Section 3

Mr. Walker, would it be fair to say

3

in comparing what this freeze is to what a setoff is that

4

a freeze, a temporary hold, is to a setoff what a TRO is

5

to a permanent injunction?

6

7

MR. WALKER:

No, Your Honor.

I would strongly

disagree with that.

8

There is a temporal aspect to it, because an

9

administrative hold is a temporary preservation of the

10

amount of the bank balance, the amount of the bank claim

11

pending bankruptcy court review.

12

QUESTION:

But if there is such a thing as an

3

administrative hold or freeze, as you say that there is

4

under the statute, wouldn't one expect to find some

5

auxiliary rules governing it?

6

It is -- it does have the drastic consequence of

7

preventing the accountholder from cashing checks.

8

it does have that consequence, wouldn't one expect the

9

statute to say, but bank, if you do this, you've got to

20

give the debtor immediate notice that you're doing it so

21

he won't write checks that won't be cashed, you have to

22

tell the court that you're doing it, and get the

23

confirmation of the setoff as soon as possible?

24
25

But there's nothing.

Since

There's nothing that tells

us what conditions govern this hold.

QUESTION:

1

Your Honor, I believe there's very-

2

clear language in the Bankruptcy Code itself which tells

3

the Court what governs.

4

If I may refer the Court to page A7 of our

5

original brief, where the Court will find the statute

6

section 542(b), the language I would specifically refer to

7

is where the creditor is directed to pay such debt to or

8

on the order of the trustee except to the extent that such

9

debt may be offset under section 553.
The phrase "may be offset" clearly indicates it

10
11

is permissible to withhold payment short of a setoff.

12

QUESTION:

Well, tell me --

13

QUESTION:

I thought that was part of a turnover

proceeding.

3

reasonably thinks is the setoff -- this is a very sensible

theory, but I think Justice Ginsburg's question was

directed to, where is its grounding in the code?
And you refer to 542, but I thought that was

when there was a turnover proceeding.

me if I'm wrong.

9

MR. WALKER:

Maybe I -- correct

Justice Kennedy, let me address

10

that, and I'll try to give a more complete answer to

11

Justice Ginsburg.
First, this is really respondent's point, that a

12

13

court order is required before an administrative hold can

14

be placed.

15

If there is one point this Court should know the

16

Bankruptcy Code is perfectly clear about, that is when a

17

court order is required.

18

instances when an order is required.

19

The Code is replete with

In fact, section 542 itself, in subpart (e),

20

refers to a court order.

employment of professionals, the code says when a court

order is required.

spell out these details, but this is consistent with many,

many aspects of bankruptcy practice in the code and the

rules.

Your Honor, at the time of the hold

the amount owed was approximately $3,250.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. WALKER:

And the hold was $3,500.
Yes, Your Honor, but given the

14

history of this case, I would submit that the bank didn't

hold enough, given its right to attorney's fees as well,

16

and the bank held not enough to cover the attorney's fees

QUESTION:

But I take it the ultimate point is,

2

if the bank purports to -- if the bank freezes too much,

if -- in aid of its claimed setoff, it's simply going to

takes its chances.

in place pursuant to section 542(b) pending the outcome of

2

a pending motion for leave from stay, there should be no

3

question that the automatic stay has not been violated.

4

QUESTION:

But Mr. Walker, there's nothing in

5

the code that requires notification, and I assume that

6

under the scheme as you envision it, the bankruptcy code

7

creates a sort of temporary stalemate in order to enable a

8

creditor having a right of setoff, a potential right of

9

setoff, to take the action to effectuate it, and maybe the

10

burden is on the debtor to file for a turnover order with

11

the bank to get the bank to turn over any moneys being

12

held, and maybe that's how the issue comes up.

13

MR. WALKER:

That is correct, Justice O'Connor.

The Bankruptcy Code does not place the onus of initiating

MR. WALKER:

QUESTION:

That's why I think the bank -I understood you in effect to say

4

that although the hold itself is not a contempt of court

or a violation, if he just -- if the bank puts a hold on

and then keeps its mouth closed for 30 days or more, it

7

might well ripen into a contempt.

MR. WALKER:

QUESTION:

10

That's -- that's -That's what I thought was your

position.

11

MR. WALKER:

12

I think I can clarify the issues the Court has

13

identified by, let's take this out of the bank-depositor

14

relationship.

15

That's possible, Justice Stevens.

Consider the bank as a purchaser of an automated

16

teller machine, and owes money to the debtor but has a

17

breach of warranty claim.

18

automatic stay mandates that the bank pay the disputed

19

claim even though it has a complete defense, and

20

consistent with that, a setoff right is a complete defense

21

under section 542(b).

No one would suggest that the

all would agree are wrong results.

Is that how it usually occurs, that for, what
was it, 8 months here, the bank says absolutely nothing?
MR. WALKER:

I think, Your Honor, it would be an

17

exaggeration to say what usually occurs because bankruptcy

18

sees it many ways.

19

Many times, secured creditors will act with

20

great vigilance and speed, and oppose confirmation.

21

times, creditors with security interests don't care about

22

a Chapter 13 plan, and will rely on their lien rights

liens are unaffected, so I would not --

of them.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA

3

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

4

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

5
6

7

MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

may it please the Court:
The Bankruptcy Code expressly preserves a

8

creditor's right of setoff, but section 362 of the code

9

stays its exercise pending an orderly determination of the

10

11

debtor's and creditor's rights.
In our view, the court of appeals was wrong in

12

this case to conclude that the bank exercised its right of

13

setoff and thereby violated section 362 when it froze

14

respondent's bank account pending a judicial determination

15

of its rights.

16

That freeze was simply a refusal to pay a

17

contract debt that was consistent with the language and

18

the purpose of the automatic stay, and in our view, any

19

other conclusion in this case would render the right of a

20

setoff meaningless.

21

Let me start with the language of 362(a)(7) on

22

which the court of appeals relied.

A freeze is not a

23

setoff under that provision, because subsection (a)(7)

24

stays the setoff of a prepetition debt.

25

setoff without further definition, Congress must have

QUESTION:

Mr. Estrada, what would your view be

6

if Maryland passed a statue that said, an administrative

7

hold shall be a "setoff" as a matter of Maryland law?

MR. ESTRADA:

Our view in this case would be

entirely identical, Justice Stevens, because in our view

You think setoff is defined as a

12

matter of Federal law.

13

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes.

For purposes of section 362

14

at least, we think it should and is a matter of Federal

15

law, and let me sort of get into that a little bit.

16

There is no question that the right that is

17

reserved by the code as a substantive matter under section

18

553 is one that is not conferred by bankruptcy law but it

1

is dependent in some underlying sorts of law that may be

Federal or State.

22

because of Federal common law.

Congress chose indicates that Congress was intending to

1

be covered uniformly, and it cannot be, for example, that

2

a State that has a quirky law like the -- like

3

Pennsylvania had in one of the reported cases, for

4

example, saying that there was an automatic setoff, that

5

that would result in the violation of a stay without any

6

action on the part of the creditor as a matter of law.

7

As used in section 362, it seems to me more

8

sensible to read the language in its ordinary legal sense,

9

and therefore, until and unless a creditor takes some

10

affirmative act to credit and debit the offsetting

11

balances and to make a record of that event, a setoff has

12

not occurred.

13

By contrast, a freeze, like the stay itself,

14

merely maintains the status quo by conserving the

15

offsetting balances in the same State until there is a

16

judicial determination of the party's rights.

17

So it may well be that in some sense the freeze

18

itself is an affirmative act, but it's not one that is an

19

affirmative act in the sense that is relevant here.

20

QUESTION:

But from the point of view of the

21

debtor, the effect is the same.

23

mark the setoff as a permanent one, but from the debtor's

24

point of view it means, I have no access to this account.

think that that controls the interpretation of section

5

QUESTION:

With reference to 362, what does 362

conceivably achieve, then?

Oh, what it does is to try to keep

creditors from taking affirmative acts to improve their

7

status vis-a-vis the other creditors, and --

8

9

QUESTION:

It seems to me the only affirmative

act that they care about is not paying the money.

Isn't

10

that -- and that's achieved this way as effectively as by

11

doing what you call a full dress setoff.

12

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, no, because what 362 does

13

not do, Justice Scalia, is that it is not a section for

14

the turnover or payover of -- for the turnover of property

15

or the payover of debts.

16

different section of the statute would have no point,

17

because section 542 deals specifically with the

18

circumstances under which a creditor must turn over

19

property to the debtor, or to pay over debts.

20

QUESTION:

If that were the case, then a

Under your theory, before you get to

21

that section, why wouldn't the bank be violating the

22

automatic stay provisions of (4), which is any act to

23

create or perfect or enforce a lien, or (6), any act to

collect, assess, or recover a claim?

they're not prohibited by those particular sections.
MR. ESTRADA:

Well, as to (4), it is not really

Under section (a)(6), our answer

14

would be that as a matter of the structure of the code,

Justice Kennedy, it cannot be that where the act simply is

16

one of refusal to capitulate to a debtor's assertion of

Congress to have intended that anyone who's faced with a

MR. ESTRADA:

I agree with the first part of

your statement, Justice Souter, but not the second.

true that it is any act.

8

is whether it is an act that violates the automatic stay,

It is

However, the relevant question

Oh, I grant you.

In other words, it

11

can literally fall within the term, and still not be a

MR. ESTRADA:

13

It can literally fall within a

clause of the automatic stay, but that does not resolve

the question whether the rest of that section, read in

light of the other applicable sections of the code,

QUESTION:

Not within the intended meaning of

Saying -And the answer --

We have to depart somewhat from the

plain language, I guess.
MR. ESTRADA:

No, you do not, because as the

11

Court pointed out in Timbers of Inward Forest, the

12

question is not whether one of the lines or subsections in

13

the Bankruptcy Code, read in isolation, might lend

14

credence to a claim under the code, but whether that is a

15

reading that makes sense in light of the code as a whole.

16

And the plain meaning rule is not a rule of

17

reading isolated sentences in a statute, it is a rule of

18

reading the code in its entirety, and our submission here

19

is that on the facts of this case, where all a creditor

20

has done is to refuse to capitulate to a debtor's

21

assertion of rights and property so that he may present a

22

defense to a proper legal forum, the other provisions of

the code, the entire structure of the law makes the

1

issue being the State or Federal law.

I'd worry about

2

having Federal law here simply because you start defining

3

the word setoff in this provision under Federal law, it

4

will have a spillover to other provisions, where surely it

5

should be State.
All the other things like liens are State, the

6

7

Bankruptcy Code's property definitions are primarily

8

State, and so why should we start saying it's Federal when

9

it sort of mucks up the Code, particularly when you don't

10
11

need to?
MR. ESTRADA:

As I said, because in the context

12

of 362, that would make sense.

3

QUESTION:

Yes, but you'd be parsing one thing

4

out of 362, where all of the other property definitions

5

are State, suddenly call this one Federal, and the word

6

setoff appears throughout the rest of the code, and you'd

7

say, oh, those are -- I mean, those are State, too, and we

8

don't need to do it.

9

MR. ESTRADA:

Except that as used in section

20

362, the word setoff is not used to describe property but

21

to describe conduct, and in that context it makes sense to

deal with a uniform Federal definition, Justice Breyer.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

1

MR. SCHLOSSBERG:

2

3

Justice Stevens, may it please

the Court:

4

In hearing the argument of counsel just now, I'm

5

struck that I think what's being argued for is a different

6

construct of a Bankruptcy Code than what Congress

7

intended.

8

It seems like I'm hearing that we're supposed to

9

have a creditor in possession, not a debtor in possession,

10

not a Chapter

3 debtor in possession, but that Congress

11

intended that the creditor is supposed to make the

12

determination as to when he may have a lien right and as

3

to when that lien right might well be satisfied by some

4

claim of setoff in some amount that they think is

5

satisfactory to satisfy their claim.

6

QUESTION:

This claim is basically that banks

7

and other people like landlords have to be able to keep

8

the property temporarily, not pay the debt temporarily,

9

until they can run in and get the automatic stay lifted,

20

otherwise, as happened here, the person will run to the

21

bank and he'll withdraw all the money, and that's the last

22

they'll ever see of it.

23

That's basically their argument.

They say if the word setoff means anything, they

24

have to have at least a temporary freeze, otherwise it's

25

meaningless.

Well, it is in the drafting, but the

special debtor-creditor relationship.

This Court

16

determined what that debtor-creditor relationship was back

17

in 1904 in the New York County Bank case cited in

18

petitioner's brief, interestingly, New York County Bank v.

that if there is a special obligation, an obligation by

statute, as in the case of the Federal Government, then in

that event you can't, you the creditor can't unilaterally

QUESTION:

7

superadded obligation is also defined by reference to the

8

bank's right to assert its secured claim, is it not?
MR. SCHLOSSBERG:

9

Yes, Your Honor, but for the

10

fact that the bank's right to assert its secured claim by

11

way of setoff is conditioned by section 362(a)(7), and

12

their right to administratively freeze beforehand is

13

similarly conditioned by section 362(a)(3), certainly, and

2

other unsecured creditor.
Remembering that a setoff claim is, at its very

3
4

basis, nothing more than an unsecured claim, this is the

5

only unsecured claim that gets paid 100 cents on the

6

dollar in a bankruptcy case, because it gets offset

7

against the claim that the debtor has against that

8

creditor.

9

It gets paid 100 cents, and Congress has decided

10

that there's a little bit of an obligation, a little

11

conditioning, excuse me, that goes with that right to get

12

100 cents on the dollar instead of dimes on the dollar,

13

and that is, you've got to come into court first and ask

14

the court for permission to take your 100 cents.

QUESTION:

are simply holding it administratively until such a

there, you mentioned again the security deposits, and I

I believe Congress is directing that there is a

they seem to be reconcilable if you take the clause out.

There would be no need for

There is no basis in the code, contrary to

worse than every other class of creditors.

4

certainly doesn't, and the respondent's answers to this

Court's questions today have been inconsistent, depending

on the question, and the only reconciliation of those

positions is that financial institutions are not entitled

to be treated, under the code, like other creditors, but

No, Your Honor.

I believe they are
