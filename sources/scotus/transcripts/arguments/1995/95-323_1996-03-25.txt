ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JONES:

9
10

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves the detailed statutory

12

priorities that Congress has enacted to govern the payment

13

of claims in bankruptcy cases.

14

the Bankruptcy Code provides that postpetition tax penalty

15

claims are to be treated as administrative expenses of the

16

debtor's estate with a first priority in payment.

Section 503(b)(1)(C) of

17

The statute codifies this Court's 1966 decision

18

in Nicholas v. United States, which reached precisely the

19

same conclusion under prior law.

20

In this case, however, the court of appeals

21

stated that it did not see the fairness or the justice of

22

the first priority for postpetition tax penalty claims.

23

The court stated that it would be more fair and more just

24

for general commercial creditors to be paid in advance of

25

tax petition claims and therefore reverse the statutory

1

priorities, changing the priority for postpetition tax

2

penalty claims from first to last.

3

The court stated that its restructuring of the

4

statutory priorities was justified by the principles of

5

equitable subordination that Congress codified in 1978 as

6

section 510(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, but the principles

7

of equitable subordination do not confer such a broad

8

power of statutory nullification on bankruptcy courts.

I

9

The principles of equitable subordination were

10

designed to provide a remedy for the individual misconduct

11

of a creditor in acquiring or pursuing his claim.

12

Court stated in the Comstock case, the doctrine deprives

13

the wrongdoer of the fruits of his wrong.

As this

14

Prior to the enactment of the Bankruptcy Code,

15

the courts have consistently held that in the absence of

16

creditor misconduct, courts were not permitted under the

17

principles of equitable subordination to simply disregard

18

a statutory priority that they disagreed with.

19

not permitted to say, as the court said in this case, that

20

the statutory priority is a mistake and will not be

21

enforced.

They were

The court of appeals recognized in this case

22

23

that

24

equitable subordination, that doctrine served the limited

25

function of providing a guarantee against creditor

under the traditional judge-made principles of

1

misconduct, but the court reasoned that when Congress

2

codified these principles in 1978, Congress somehow

3

radically altered the scope of the doctrine, and that it

4

is now appropriate for the court to disregard a statutory

5

priority when the court concludes that it is just to do

6

so.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, do you agree that a tax

8

penalty claim in theory could be subordinated if there

9

were some sufficient reason for finding fault with the

10
11

Government -- misconduct?
MR. JONES:

I agree that the principles of

12

equitable subordination can apply to all claims.

13

understanding of those principles and the understanding

14

that this Court stated in the Comstock case and that all

15

other courts had stated prior to the enactment of the

16

Bankruptcy Code was that what those principles did was to

17

prevent a creditor from acquiring or pursuing a claim

18

based upon misconduct.

19

Bankruptcy Code states, but we think it is obvious, that

20

these principles of equitable subordination would rarely

21

apply to a tax claim, but if --

22

QUESTION:

Our

The legislative history of the

Yes, but I took your position

23

basically to be that in a particular case, no equitable

24

subordination absent a showing of inequitable conduct.

MR. JONES:

That is correct.

That is what the

4

doctrine is designed -QUESTION:

And in theory the Government could

engage in such conduct.
MR. JONES:

In theory, it could.

Again, I think

5

it would be rare that we could think of a situation where

6

that would happen, and the Senate report on this bill made

7

that very point, but certainly, if the United States

8

acquired a claim through misconduct, it would be subject

9

to equitable subordination.

10

QUESTION:

Of course, those of us who look to

11

legislative history have got one problem from your

12

standpoint, and that is, it may be that the person who

13

made the statement about the intent was wrong in

14

describing what courts had been doing, but the intent

15

still seems to be there, and what is the tie-breaker?

16

we look to the person's mistake, or to the person's intent

17

in making the statement?

18

MR. JONES:

Do

Well, let me -- that is -- the court

19

of appeals relied on what you're referring to, which is a

20

fragment of a single sentence of the floor statements of

21

the sponsors of the bill, but let's consider that

22

statement in its context.

23

The sponsors made several points.

First, they

24

pointed out that the principles of equitable subordination

25

that were being codified were those expressed in existing
6

1

case law, and certainly that represents an intent to

2

incorporate, not to significantly alter the preexisting

3

doctrine.

4

Second, the sponsors stated that under existing

5

case law, the principles of equitable subordination served

6

as a remedy for creditor misconduct much in the same way

7

that this court had said in the Comstock case.
4

8

Now, the third thing they said, and this is the

9

point that the court of appeals relied on, was that the

10

principles of equitable subordination would also permit

11

subordination of a claim of a status susceptible to

12

subordination such as a penalty.

13

That statement was not a correct description of

14

existing case law.

15

that type prior to the adoption of the Bankruptcy Code

16

and, indeed, as I have already mentioned, in 1966 in the

17

Nicholas case this Court held that postpetition tax

18

penalty claims were entitled to a first priority in

19

bankruptcy.

There was literally no case law of

20

The Senate report does not contain the

21

misstatement that is in this fragment of the sentence from

22

the floor statements.

23

QUESTION:

But isn't there also a statement in

24

that report that is not simply case law frozen as of a

25

point in time but case law as further developed?

MR. JONES:

1

We certainly agree that when

2

Congress codified these principles it intended for the

3

courts to continue developing them, and it is appropriate

4

for the courts to continue devising rules that guard

5

against creditor misconduct and that deprive the wrongdoer

6

of the fruits of its wrong, but nothing in those ordinary,

7

equitable principles provide any support for the novel

8

contention that a court in equity can simply disregard a

9

statute that it disagrees with.
As the Ninth Circuit said in the Stebbins case,

10
11

neither general equitable principles nor the specific

12

principles of equitable subordination authorize a court to

13

simply say a statutory priority is a mistake and will not

14

be enforced, and that is in essence exactly what the court

15

of appeals held in this case.

16

QUESTION:

The same statement, Mr. Jones,

17

appears -- I mean, it was obviously carefully drawn up.

18

It appears verbatim in both the House and the Senate, is

19

that correct?

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

That's a mistake, but -Yes.

MR. JONES:

Congress is not in the
It is in the

I think read in its entirety, which,

11

of course, if we're going to read the legislative history

12

we have to do that, read in its entirety, what the history

13

manifests is an intent to incorporate existing case law

14

and then a misdescription of one aspect of that case law.

15

The intent to incorporate existing case law is

16

manifest in the Senate report which doesn't contain the

17

misdescription of the existing case law, but beyond the

18

question of intent and description is just the simple

19

logic of the situation.

20

It is improbable that Congress intended, by

21

adopting such a broad concept of equitable subordination,

22

to have rendered all of its substantive statutory

23

priorities essentially meaningless, which is a

24

construction that would result from the opinion in this

25

case, and let me see if I can explain that.

QUESTION:

1

Before you do, Mr. Jones, could you

2

give us an example of the rare case in which a tax penalty

3

claim could be subordinated, and you quoted the

4

legislative history to that effect.

5

would be a rare case --

6

MR. JONES:

7

QUESTION:

8

You said that it

Yes.
-- and I was trying to envision such

a case and couldn't come up with one.

9

MR. JONES:

Well, the situation that would exist

10

with respect to private creditors is a situation where the

11

claim was obtained by fraud or by ruse, or was obtained

12

through some unfair manipulation of the bankruptcy

13

process.

14

It's hard for me, as it is for you, Justice

15

Ginsburg, to put a concrete concept to apply those rules

16

in a concrete way to tax collection.

17

QUESTION:

Well, what about a case in which some

18

factotum of the Government said the payment, let's say to

19

an ERISA plan or whatever it may be, is due in January,

20

and in fact it was due in December and the Government is

21

not estopped?

22

I suppose you could say that's not a case of

23

malicious wrongdoing, but it would be a case in which the

24

taxpayer relied detrimentally on the Government and then

25

ends up with perhaps a nonwaivable penalty.

(800) FOR DEPO

That would be

1

2

a case, I suppose, in which there could be subordination.
MR. JONES:

I certainly believe that there are

3

situations that could occur, and I'm obviously not here to

4

try to anticipate all of them.

5

I will agree with you that if there was a

6

situation where an authorized representative of the United

7

States had taken some action that was unfair to other

8

creditors in achieving a preference for a Government claim

9

that wouldn't otherwise have been factually appropriate,

10

that would be the kind of context in which equitable

11

subordination might apply.

12

I think actually equitable subordination is a

13

broad doctrine when it applies.

14

prevent misconduct in any of its manners of manifestation,

15

and we don't intend to suggest that it doesn't have this

16

broad objective, but we think it reasonably clear it

17

doesn't have the broad objective of making the statutory

18

priorities essentially meaningless.

19

It broadly is designed to

It is obvious, we think, that if the only

20

effective priority rule in bankruptcy cases turned on a

21

concept as elastic as fairness, that extraordinary

22

uncertainty would exist for all creditors.

23

For example, on grounds of fairness should a

24

tort claim for pain and suffering be subordinated on a

25

rationale applied in this case that it's not a pecuniary

What do we make of the fifth priority for claims

3

5

Is that more fair than the new

Now, these kinds of categorical determinations

6

are exactly what Congress does when it enacts these

7

statutory priorities.

8

9

With respect to tax penalty claims alone,
Congress has four separate rules.

Postpetition tax

10

penalty claims are given a first priority, some types of

11

prepetition tax penalty claims have a seventh priority,

12

other types of prepetition tax penalty claims are treated

13

as general unsecured claims in a Chapter 11 and are

14

subordinated to general unsecured claims in a Chapter 7.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Jones, am I correct that every

16

lower court that has confronted this issue has come out

17

the way the court came out here?

18

MR. JONES:

No -- well, there has been a recent

19

set of cases that have said equitable subordination

20

doesn't require proof of creditor misconduct.

21

been a long, much more substantial history of cases that

22

says that it do, and the cases -- that it does require

creditor misconduct.

silentio, the earlier case in which shareholders who had

2

asserted a claim of fraud against the corporation had

3

their claim subordinated to others, I take it, because the

4

judge felt this is simply a way in which shareholders that

5

should be absolutely at the end of the queue have worked

6

out to jump a lot of other people who would otherwise have

7

been ahead of them, so they assert their claim in the form

8

of a claim for fraud.

9

MR. JONES:

Justice Breyer, I think that you

10

have the timing and the courts wrong in your description

11

of those two cases.
The Comstock case was a decision by this

12

3

Court --

QUESTION:

5

MR. JONES:

Yes.
-- and it held that the doctrine is

6

designed to deprive the wrongdoer of the fruits of his

wrong, and that every case prior to the Bankruptcy Code

8

held the same thing, except there was a Second Circuit

9

decision that you were referring to involving the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND J. PIKNA, JR.

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

16

MR. PIKNA:

Very well, Mr. Jones.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
This is a Chapter 7 case.

It is critical to

17

remember that fact, because section 726 of the Bankruptcy

18

Code, which controls the order of distribution in

19

Chapter 7 cases, in order to assure the equality to all

20

creditors begins with the clause, except as provided in

21

section 510 of the Bankruptcy Code.

22

What the Government seeks to do is to

23

effectively eliminate that section.

24

eliminate the distinction between nonpecuniary loss tax

25

penalties, which are the types of penalties which we have

1

in this case, from pecuniary loss tax penalty claims.
The difference is critical.

2

In a prepetition

3

context, for example, section 726(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy

4

Code expressly subordinates nonpecuniary loss tax penalty

5

claims to the claims of general unsecured creditors.
In this particular case, we have a plan that was

9

The vast majority of the penalties in issue
There was no

creditors to react and say, gee, we ought to stop this.
When the case converted, the tax was owed, the

12

penalties were owed, but these are not for financial loss.

13

These are penalties that are punitive, or to deter, and as

14

the Court stated unanimously in Simonson v. Granquist, the

15

majority of the Court stated that the purpose of penalties

16

is to punish, and the burden would fall on the innocent

17

creditors in the case.

18

The dissent agreed with that proposition, that

19

the punitive aspect of penalties was contrary to the

20

intent of the Bankruptcy Code and the equality of

21

distribution which was contemplated.

22

The Bankruptcy Code also distinguishes between

23

nonpecuniary and pecuniary loss penalties in section

24

507(a), now (8), formerly (7), which deals with the

25

priority to be accorded to prepetition tax penalties.

In the context of section 503(b)(1)(C), where

the Court -- where the statute refers to penalties, it

3

does not draw that fine line distinction, because Congress

did not have to.

applicable to those penalties and stated that they may be

subordinated under section 510.
QUESTION:

8

9

Mr. Pikna, the problem that I have in

the case is a very broad conceptual one.

That is, I can

10

understand why Congress would say, there are cases which

11

we cannot envision and cannot provide for by law because

12

they turn on individual wrongdoing, or individual conduct

13

in any event, and we want you, the courts, to provide for

14

them.

15

I can understand why Congress would do that.
What I cannot understand, and what would worry

16

me very much, would be why Congress would say, we want

17

you, in effect, to reorder the priorities that we have

18

set, and to do so as a categorical matter because you

19

think certain priorities are unworthy of the position that

20

we have given them.

21

That is statutory amendment.

I mean, that is delegation, to put it another

22

way, without any standard at all.

23

out there and reshuffle the cards as you think right.

That's the conceptual problem that bothers me.

QUESTION:

No, but one doesn't say that, and

2

that's not what the Government is saying.

The Government

is saying that in fact a court may consider the kind of

4

individual circumstances that bear on the conscience of

5

equity that simply cannot be provided for in a categorical

6

way in advance by a legislature, and that is all it has

7

done, and once you get beyond that, you have basically

8

gotten into statutory redrafting, or a claim of delegation

9

not only without standards but standards quite contrary to

10

those that Congress adopted, and that would seem to be an

11

illegitimate interpretation of the statute.

12

MR. PIKNA:

Your Honor, if the court ruling were

13

that all nonpecuniary loss tax penalty claims are

automatically subordinated without more, we would agree

that there is a new --

going to attack a portion of the category rather than the

20

least a partial categorical reordering that you're

21

claiming for the court's authority under the statute.

that were arising through misconduct are categories.

tax penalties we agree are fundamentally different from

pecuniary loss tax penalty claims, and we believe that in

policy expressed through the Congress through its

enactments, through the statutes, and through the

you agree with the Government in this, and do I understand

this correctly that, prior to the Bankruptcy Code a

first priority?

MR. PIKNA:

Yes, Your Honor.
All right.

17

question that I had is just as technical, and I want to

administrative expense like anything else, postpetition.

2

But I did imagine from what you're saying that

3

there could be a case where we're finding it hard to get

4

unanimous agreement among unsecured creditors, and the

5

bankruptcy judge works out that if I could subordinate the

6

penalty on the tax below the unsecured creditors there

7

will be enough money for them under a section 7, and

8

therefore I don't need the unanimity, and that might be

9

why he wants to subordinate in the Chapter 11.

He wants

10

the authority to have subordinated the penalty in the

11

hypothetical Chapter 7.
Now, I raise that to know if that's technically

12

13

right, or if it's not, just say no, and I will erase it

14

from my mind.

Now, in the context of a Chapter 7 case, we

believe that the policy of equitable -- of equal

to what is to be accomplished.

the world, to subordinate a postpetition tax penalty, and

2

I'm struggling to think if there's any such circumstance,

3

and so far, given your answers, I think the answer is no,

4

there is no such circumstance that would be special.

5

So I'm trying to think, I'm struggling, is there

6

any circumstance in which it would make sense, equitably,

7

and your answer to that, which you have a strong interest

8

in saying I'm wrong, all right, why am I wrong?

9

what everybody's been asking you, I think.

10
11
12

MR. PIKNA:

That's

Your Honor, it will also vary on the

nature of the debtor and who bears the penalty.
What we are expressing is that the penalties are

13

subordinated not because they're just nonpecuniary loss,

14

but in this particular context it is a corporate debtor,

15

it is a debtor in Chapter 7, and there are insufficient

16

funds to go around.

17

Now, the degree of subordination that the

18

bankruptcy court stated subordinate to general unsecured

19

claims, if that is error would be harmless error.

20

court could have said, just subordinate the nonpecuniary

21

loss penalty to other administrative expense pecuniary

6

It is up to the moving party to

Perhaps the correct remedy here would have been

7

for the Internal Revenue Service to have asked for the tax

8

to be subordinated, because the responsible officers under
section 6672 of the Internal Revenue Code are responsible

10

for the tax and interest, but it does not state that

11

they're responsible for the penalties.

12

So there's no deterrent effect on section 6672

13

of the Internal Revenue Code, which is really what this

particular case and these particular taxes are about, for

15

the officers to not go ahead and not pay the taxes.

do they care?

What

They don't have to pay it.

17

It's the creditors, the innocent creditors who

are giving value to the debtor, who are trying to assist

the corporation in reorganizing, who find out after the

debtor fails to pay taxes that they are now also being hit

with this large penalty, a penalty for which the Internal

Revenue Service gave nothing, but which the statute says,

Congress has dealt with that

QUESTION:

So the point was that there was no

inducement, or no incentive, because the officer's never

going to be liable for the penalty anyway.

14

MR. JONES:

Well, this Court addressed, of

15

course, the question of whether this is a fair result in

16

the Nicholas case, and the Court said that the first

17

priority for postpetition tax penalties is necessary to

18

ensure that the debtors abide by the same rules that all

19

other people conducting business abide by.

20

The priority, if you will, is fair in this broad

21

legislative sense, because it deprives the debtor of an

22

unfair advantage vis-a-vis everybody else who's out there

23

conducting business.

The contention that it's unfair to specific
creditors in this bankruptcy case is just another way of

saying that they think the Congress made a mistake, that

2

it's not a good idea to have this priority.

when Congress goes to the trouble of drafting these

priorities, they do it for a reason.

MR. JONES:

Well, maybe I don't -- yes.
If you're in a Chapter 11 -Yes.
And the question is, can you get

unanimity, and the answer is no, but is there some way to

cram it down?

1129(a)(7) specifies that if you want to

10

cram it down on the nonconsenting creditors you've got to

11

give them the same treatment they'd get in a 7, and so in

12

a 7, under 726(a)(1), the first priority of this

postpetition tax penalty claim is recognized.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. JONES:

16

Right.
In an 11, the court has to recognize

it, too.

QUESTION:

Right, and that's why what the

bankruptcy trustee wants to say, well, were I in a 7, I'd
