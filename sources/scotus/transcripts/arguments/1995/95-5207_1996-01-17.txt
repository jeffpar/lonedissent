ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT ALAN RAVITZ

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RAVITZ:

12

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
This case presents the question whether the

15

State of Oklahoma may allocate a level of proof as high as

16

clear and convincing evidence on the defendant in

17

determining his competency to stand trial.

18

Despite uncontroverted expert testimony the

19

accuracy of which was not disputed by the trial judge,

20

despite testimony from defense team investigators that Mr.

21

Cooper was cracking up and was incompetent, despite

22

numerous witnesses and court observations of peculiar

23

conduct throughout a 3 to 4-week period prior to trial,

24

and despite the fact that the trial judge in Oklahoma

25

failed to find Mr. Cooper was malingering, the court,

1

utilizing a clear and convincing standard of proof, held

2

that Mr. Cooper was competent to stand trial.

3

QUESTION:

Well, if the evidence was so

4

overwhelming, as you describe it, Mr. Ravitz, one would

5

think that it met even a clear and convincing test.

6

MR. RAVITZ:

I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that

7

goes exactly to the crux of this argument, that when

8

people look at a clear and convincing test, they take it

9

as such a high burden that despite this type of evidence

10

they can legitimately conclude, using this burden of

11

proof, or this standard of proof, and say, as a matter of

12

law, despite all this evidence, this person is still

13

competent to stand trial.

14

QUESTION:

What do you mean, as a matter of law?

15

I take it the State is certainly entitled to put the

16

burden of proof on the person who is claiming to be

17

mentally incompetent.

18

MR. RAVITZ:

19

QUESTION:

Absolutely.
And so, if you say -- you say as a

20

matter of law, the trier of fact is free to disbelieve

21

witnesses, so I don't see where you get as a matter of law

22

coming out of this.

23

MR. RAVITZ:

What we're saying is that the

24

competency standard, the clear and convincing standard is

25

a standard of law.

This particular court has said that to reach

1

2

this you need certain levels of certainty.

3

specifically said that this standard is used to take away

4

a liberty interest, that's how high of a standard it's

5

used for, and this standard can only be met, and Oklahoma

6

used the term, the uniform instructions at the time of the

7

Cooper trial used the term unmistakable.
Now, there's no evidence to show the judge used

8

9

This court has

the term unmistakable, but this judge was familiar with

10

the stock instructions, so he had to be satisfied

11

unmistakably that Cooper was incompetent.

Oklahoma didn't use the word unmistakable, did it?

Appeals --

from the record that unmistakable was used.

22

clear and convincing standard is such a high burden,

23

regardless of whether you call it unmistakable, or you say

24

this is the standard necessary to take one's individual

25

liberties away from him.

Currently there was a

QUESTION:

1

Well, the clear and convincing

2

evidence standard is intermediate as I've understood it

3

and as I think our opinions - - between the preponderance

4

of the evidence standard which obtains in most civil

5

cases, and beyond a reasonable doubt, which is what you

6

have to find guilt by.

7

than the preponderance, but it's lower than beyond a

8

reasonable doubt.

9
10

It's -- obviously, it's higher

What is it that enables us to say that it ought
to be one rather than the other?
MR. RAVITZ:

11

I think we have to look at the

12

fundamental liberty interest involved in an incompetent

13

individual being placed on trial.

14

Our system of justice demands that an individual

15

who cannot appreciate the consequences of his actions and

16

does not understand the proceedings cannot assist counsel,

17

cannot go on trial for his life, and this standard takes

18

away liberty interests of that individual.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. RAVITZ:

21

22

We can hear you pretty well, Mr. -I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, Mr. Chief

Justice.
The truth-seeking process of a criminal trial is

23

compromised when we require clear and convincing evidence

24

of incompetency before we go to trial.

25

Court in Medina looked at the impact on the particular

1

harm to the fundamental right.
This Court concluded in Medina that in the

2

3

narrow class of cases where the evidence was at equipoise

4

-- in other words, where the evidence was just as likely

5

for competency as incompetency -- that it justified the

6

risk as to the fundamental right not to be tried while

7

incompetent.

QUESTION:

8

9

However - -

this case?

Do you rely on historical practice in

Do we know what States have required in this

10

area, and do we know how many States are now changing to

11

this higher standard of proof?

12

MR. RAVITZ:

Justice O'Connor, historically at

13

common law there was no question that this was -- there

14

was a preponderance standard.

15

There are only four States that have a clear and

16

convincing standard.
QUESTION:

17
18

Yes, we do rely on history.

How recently did they adopt that,

would you remind me?
MR. RAVITZ:

19

Yes, Justice Scalia.

20

Connecticut -- Pennsylvania was the first State adopting

21

it in 1976.

22

after Addington.

Addington, but has since changed their statute.

Connecticut and Oklahoma adopted it shortly
Wisconsin initially adopted it after

Why did Addington cause them to adopt

it?

MR. RAVITZ:

1

Well, I think that the court, or

2

the Oklahoma legislators and the legislators of

3

Connecticut misunderstood what this Court said in

4

Addington.

dangerousness necessary for an indefinite civil commitment

with the standard of proof utilized for determining

competency hearings, incorrectly, I might add.
QUESTION:

10

I think they tried to combine the finding of

Well, it's certainly convenient to

combine the two, so that if the person can't be tried he
can be put away.

I mean, once you make that -- right?

There's no problem --we don't

dispute the State's right to, at a competency

19

determination, have the fact-finder make a determination

20

of whether the individual is clear and convincingly

21

dangerous.

22

that they have an absolute right, but additionally that's

23

not even necessary for the initial competency

24

determination.

25

We don't dispute that.

There's no question

Oklahoma has a right, without even a showing of clear

1

and convincing evidence of violence, to have someone

2

treated for a period of time to restore their competency

3

upon motion of the individual court.

4

QUESTION:

But I guess the reason States are now

5

experimenting with requiring a higher standard of proof of

6

competency is because of Addington's requirement that to

7

civilly commit someone the proof must be by clear and

8

convincing evidence of dangerousness to self or others and

9

of mental illness.
MR. RAVITZ:

10

The standards involved with regard

11

to commitment, Justice O'Connor, are totally different

12

than the standards involved in the competency

13

determination.

14

for competency has no relation to the subsequent final

15

commitment.

In other words, the Dusky determination

That's not to say that the court cannot

QUESTION:

But that is what's driving the States

18

to adopt a different standard on competency, I suppose,

19

the hope that they won't have someone found to be

20

incompetent in a criminal case and then - - for mental

21

disability, and yet not be able to commit them for civil

22

treatment.

23

MR. RAVITZ:

I'm not saying it's not what may

24

have caused the State to do that, but you're --as what I

said in my reply brief, you're comparing apples to

oranges.
In this particular case, the standard to commit

3

somebody has no relationship to the determination of how

4

high, or the certainty that we must have before we find an

5

individual incompetent.

6

QUESTION:

But isn't --

7

QUESTION:

Well, it --

8

QUESTION:

Doesn't the point -- let's see, if

the burden -- the different -- in the two different cases,
10

in one, the plaintiff, I mean, the individual seeks -- the

11

higher standard in the Addington context is to protect the

12

individual.

13

The lower standard in the criminal context is to

14

protect the individual, because he has the burden of

15

proving incompetence in the criminal case, and the State

16

has the burden in the civil case.

17

MR. RAVITZ:

That is correct, but again, that

18

doesn't go into effect until the trial court has

1

determined that after a period of time the individual who

20

is being treated can no longer be continually treated.

21

QUESTION:

But in either case there is a

22

presumption of competency that most jurisdictions, if not

23

all jurisdictions, recognize, I take it.

24

MR. RAVITZ:

25

QUESTION:

That is correct, Justice -And Addington said that presumption

1

of competency is sufficiently valid that we're going to

2

require clear and convincing evidence to overcome it, and

3

it seems to me that's all that Oklahoma is saying here, is

4

that we are giving -- we are giving substance, we are

5

giving recognition, we are giving force to the presumption

6

of competency.

7

Now, I recognize that you can have different

8

standards for commitment than for assisting counsel at

9

your trial and so forth, but leaving that aside, it seems

10

to me that what Oklahoma is doing is giving vigor and

11

substance to the presumption of competency.
MR. RAVITZ:

12

Well, I think the presumption of

13

competency and the State interest is adequately protected

14

where -- in what Medina did, where the defense must come

15

forward with all evidence.

16

the fact-finder that this particular person is more likely

17

than not incompetent, and if the fact-finder does not --

18

is not convinced of that, regardless, based on the

19

presumption of competency or for whatever reason, the

20

fact-finder is going to conclude that the individual is

21

competent.

22

They must paint a portrait to

In fact, what this particular standard does is

23

allow people that --a fact-finder, the trial judge

24

himself, he looks at this person and he says, this person

25

is more than likely incompetent to stand trial.

SUITE 400

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

That's

1

what I think in my mind from all this evidence.

2

because of the clear and convincing standard, I'm not

3

clear and convincingly convinced, so therefore I am not

4

going to find this person incompetent, and this person is

5

going to have to go through trial.
QUESTION:

6

Yet

The Court of Criminal Appeals

7

mentioned what it thought was a propensity of some

8

defendants to malinger in this area as a justification for

9

the clear and convincing standard.

10
11

What is your response

to that?
MR. RAVITZ:

First of all, if the court

12

concludes, Mr. Chief Justice, that as a matter of fact the

13

individual is malingering, the court's going to conclude

14

that the defendant hasn't met his burden of proof under a

15

preponderance.

16

QUESTION:

Yes, but it's quite possible that

17

a -- the trial judge may feel, I can't say for sure that

18

this person is malingering, but if I had to do it by a

19

preponderance standard, I would have to say he's

20

incompetent, but clear and convincing, I can say I think

21

he's competent, and can't a State court adopt a rule of

22

burden of proof to adjust for that sort of thing, the

23

possibility of malingering, even though it's not -- you

24

can't show it in a particular case?

25

MR. RAVITZ:

Raising the standard of proof does

not facilitate a more accurate finding of malingering.
Let's take the situation where we have 100

incompetent individuals, okay, 5 of whom are malingerers,

okay, 95 of whom are not.

that 20 individuals are thereafter now found competent,

As we raise the level of

How many malingerers?

Let's assume we had 5 malingerers out of this

12

At what cost to the fundamental right not to be tried

13

while incompetent, because incompetents, if you go to

14

trial while you're incompetent -- Cooper sat there for 2-

15

1/2 weeks in orange coveralls never even talking to his

16

attorneys.

attorneys from the testimony of the experts, yet Cooper

18

went to trial.

19

How many malingerers will we have

Well, if we do, an odd one, and at what cost?

It was obvious that he was scared of his

Cooper couldn't assist in his defense.

Cooper

20

could not tell his lawyers why the act was done, how it

21

was done, was anybody with him, the degree of culpability.

22

Competence is necessary to protect all sorts of

23

fundamental rights that are implicit in the trial itself.

QUESTION:

11

MR. RAVITZ:

Yes or no?
Yes, we are following the Due

Process Clause, but this Court has applied heightened

13

levels of due process in situations where the death

14

penalty was involved.

15

This Court, recognizing the risk in Turner v.

Murray, said that in - - that you could voir dire an

individual on race and in a capital case but not in a

MR. RAVITZ:

You want

No, my argument is addressed to

board.

What about the standard in the State

MR. RAVITZ:

that insanity defense was a fundamental right.

that you said that in Medina,

As early as 1790, Justice Scalia,

in Ley's Case, which is cited in our brief, the judge

MR. RAVITZ:

Yes, right.
But I think when we look at that,

22

let's look at the experts.

How many experts do we have to

prove?

experts?

25

We had one uncontroverted expert.

What kind of cost to the system?

How many

happens if a defendant is by physical problems rendered

incapable?

were questions raised in the second stage in particular

about the defendant's terrible upbringing, about his

In the criminal case, would you

explain exactly how the Oklahoma system works if a

8

defendant says through counsel I want to challenge this

9

defendant's competence to stand trial?

10

GENERAL EDMONDSON:

Certainly.

The process is

11

initiated by an application to determine competency which

12

must state facts sufficient to raise a doubt, not even a

13

bona fide doubt as required by Pate v. Robinson and the

Drope case, but just a doubt as to the competency of the

16

That application can be brought by the accused,

by a relative of the accused, by a friend of the accused,

by a person with whom the accused resides, by a person in

whose house the accused lived, or certainly by accused's

counsel.

21

If the application is determined to raise a

legitimate doubt, or even a doubt as to the defendant's

The defendant or any of those parties that I

mentioned have the right to demand a jury trial to

determine whether there's even a doubt as to his

QUESTION:

But then who makes the determination

of whether the defendant is competent or not after the

Oklahoma has done with respect to the defense of insanity

2

on the merits at trial casts a great deal of doubt in my

3

mind concerning the necessity of the standard that

4

Oklahoma has adopted with respect to sanity to stand

5

trial.

6

You're willing to accept the burden of proving

7

to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that this individual

8

was sane 2 years ago when he committed the crime, but you

9

say it's too onerous to accept the burden of proving to

10

the jury by -- or not even proving to the jury.

It's too

11

onerous to have the defendant prove to the jury by a

12

preponderance of the evidence that he's sane today.

13

It seems to me sanity 2 years ago is a lot

14

harder to prove, and the State accepts a much higher

15

burden with respect to that.

16

GENERAL EDMONDSON:

Justice Scalia, to some

17

extent that emphasizes the risk that Oklahoma feels on a

18

determination of present competency, where the incentive

19

to malinger or to create symptoms is much greater, in our

20

estimation, than the prescience of the defendant to try to

21

create those kinds of manifestations at the time he's

22

committing an offense.
QUESTION:

But that doesn't make sense, because

he walks.

GENERAL EDMONDSON:

Well, at least he's acquitted of the

crime.

GENERAL EDMONDSON:

QUESTION:

8

On a

finding of not guilty by reason of insanity --

4
5

No, Justice Stevens.

That is correct.

I mean, he doesn't have the

criminal -- whereas in this case it's only a temporary
delay in the trial, and you can in the meantime medicate

10

him, and treat him to try and restore his competency, so

11

it seems to me the cost of losing on the insanity is much

12

heavier for the State than the cost of a temporary delay

13

in the trial, in this proceeding.

14

GENERAL EDMONDSON:

The cost may be heavier,

15

Your Honor, but we feel that the ability to prove present

16

sanity at the time of the commission of the offense, when

17

the defendant will not contemporaneously be trying to

18

manifest symptoms of incompetence, but will simply be

1

carrying out the commission of an offense, is a manageable

20

burden for the State of Oklahoma.

21

We feel greater jeopardy, particularly in a

22

serious case, being able to meet on a preponderance level

23

the ability of fabricated symptoms by a defendant falsely

24

claiming to be incompetent.

to the fairness of the system the other way.

In terms of the allocation

He says there are a lot of good

things.

He says that ultimately, if you apply this

standard of proof, the only difference between that and

4

what, 48, or 46 States do, the preponderance, is that a

5

very large number, a significant number of not -- of

6

people who weren't faking will be in prison, and that's a

big harm to the system, and the need for that in Oklahoma

is very small -- not nonexistent, but small, because the

other people, the people that you wrongly got off the

trial who were faking, you put them in the mental hospital

anyway for the most part, or they recover and you try them

later.

Now, that's -- he's saying the harm to the

Yes.

So in fact it's not just 25 to 25.

The line up is less favorable to you than that.
GENERAL EDMONDSON:

Justice Souter, there are 25

11

that use the preponderance of the evidence.

12

States may or may not allocate a burden, but we're talking

13

about the level of proof.

Some States don't say what the

level of proof is at all.

is not an evenly balanced division among the States.

I come from one of those, and

That is

But it is accurate, isn't it, that of

the States that place the burden on the defendant, only

5

four place that burden to a degree of clear and

convincing.

7

The others have a lesser burden.

GENERAL EDMONDSON:

That is correct, Justice

8

Souter, except Oklahoma does not place it on the

9

defendant, Oklahoma places it on the party that raises it,

10

and there could be instances where the State of

Oklahoma - QUESTION:

12

But if a party other than the

defendant raises the question and wants to commit the

Must the party also prove a danger to himself or t,he

community?

17

GENERAL EDMONDSON:

That is correct.

But the defendant need not prove the

danger of that kind in order to establish incompetence to

stand trial.

GENERAL EDMONDSON:

QUESTION:

That is correct also.

1

2

3

Because there are different issues in

the case.
GENERAL EDMONDSON:

But interestingly, in

4

Oklahoma's statute we incorporate in title 22, our

5

criminal provisions, the provisions out of title 43 on

6

involuntary commitment and, at the post examination

7

competency hearing stage, if the jury or the judge

8

determines that this individual is incompetent, is not

9

capable of regaining competence within the foreseeable

10

future, and is a person who is mentally ill as defined

11

under title 43 and is dangerous, then that same hearing

12

can result in the civil commitment under a clear and

13

convincing evidence standard mandated by Addington.

14

QUESTION:

Yes, but the issues are sufficiently

15

different that you could not say that in the routine case

16

of the criminal defendant seeking to establish his own

17

incompetence, if he prevails at the hearing he will not

18

necessarily be civilly committed.

19

GENERAL EDMONDSON:

I certainly would not say

20

that that would be a routine decision, Justice Stevens.

21

would say in a case, for instance, like this one, where

22

there are allegations of mental illness and where there is

23

evidence of dangerousness, had there been a finding that

24

this defendant was incompetent and unable to be restored,

25

there may very well have been also a finding that he

GENERAL EDMONDSON:

If I were facing a potential

13

I don't know whether a typical defendant would or not.

GENERAL EDMONDSON:

Well, there's a meshing -- I

recognize the fact that if you had defendant's burden

being preponderance to show incompetence, State's burden

12

being clear and convincing to commit, that there is in

fact a kind of gap between them in which some might fall.

These things obviously, by nature and by
definition --

QUESTION:

Yes, well, that would be very

difficult to tell, whereas the question that I raised

would be very easy to answer.

We'd just have to look at

the courthouse door and see who was walking out, and I

11

take it that there's no indication that was happening to

12

the degree of raising a systemic problem.

13

GENERAL EDMONDSON:

I cannot answer that

14

historically, Justice Souter, and my experience as a

have led any trier of fact to conclude that this defendant

found that this defendant was malingering and fabricating

his symptoms.

I agree with you that the cold reading of the

QUESTION:

Yes, but the likelihood of

10

malingering is just one of the facts the trier of fact has

11

to take into consideration in reaching the ultimate

12

conclusion, and it necessarily follows, as I understand

13

the Oklahoma system, that there at least exists the

14

possibility that there are a class of people who are more

likely than not incompetent.

Taking into account malingering and all of this,

more likely than not they are incompetent, and therefore

No, they've had the hearing, and

the safeguards preserve the substantive due process rights

of the defendant while still protecting against the false

findings of incompetence based upon malingering.
QUESTION:

4

General Edmondson, is there any

5

evidence in the record or any references to studies in the

6

record to indicate that in the last 20 or 30 years juries

7

or judges as fact-finders have in fact been getting

8

hoodwinked either by malingerers or by psychiatrists?

9

And I'll be candid to say -- I was a trial judge

10

once, and I'll be candid to say that I thought juries were

11

very good at smelling this sort of thing out and I never,

12

as a trial judge, had the impression that juries were

13

particularly impressed with psychiatric testimony at all,

14

and I - - is there any indication that in fact the practice

15

of deception was more successful than I was observing it?
GENERAL EDMONDSON:

16

Judge -- Your Honor, there

are, of course, studies about the effects of malingering,

QUESTION:

Even the psychiatrists can tell.

5

QUESTION:

You got that right.

6

GENERAL EDMONDSON:

None were presented in the

7

context of this trial below, and I doubt if it would be

8

very easy to get a collection of jurists who were willing

9

to say that they were in fact hoodwinked by an accused who

10
11

was falsely claiming incompetence.
I would suggest that in the context of this case

12

the accused might have been well advised to demand his

13

jury trial because the jury would not have had what the

14

court had, which was the repeated statements by defense

15

counsel that in their opinion the defendant was faking,

16

and I doubt if counsel would have made those same

17

statements, which they were required in candor and under

18

disciplinary rules to tell the court, I doubt if they

19

would have made those same statements to the court - - to

20

the jury, had a jury trial been demanded.

21

Now, whether the jury under those circumstances

22

would still have denied the finding of incompetence is

pure speculation.

but if he really had demanded a jury trial, wouldn't the

State have had the opportunity to require his counsel to

testify after there being a substitution of counsel?

4

GENERAL EDMONDSON:

The case law and the

5

statutes of the State of Oklahoma are absolutely silent on

6

this.

7

provide that there are circumstances in competency

8

proceedings where counsel might not only be a witness but

9

might be the best witness, and I do know as a matter of

QUESTION:

So probably you could have gotten it

in front of the jury if it had become a jury issue.
GENERAL EDMONDSON:

I don't know the answer to

even if counsel becomes a witness as to the manifestations

of his client, he cannot be inquired as to communications

with his client over his objection.

If there is that

to have available that fundamental right you have to show
