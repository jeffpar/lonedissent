We'll hear argument

Mr. Baran.

Is that correct pronunciation?

MR. BARAN:

That is correct.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAN WITOLD BARAN

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. BARAN:

11
12

Mr. Baran.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The Colorado Republican Party, like any party,

13
14

has a lot to say about issues and candidates, but when it

15

starts talking about congressional issues and

16

congressional candidates it becomes subject to a Federal

17

law that limits that type of core political speech.

18

the inception of this case, the Colorado Republican Party

19

has asked that this Federal law, section 441a(d)(3), be

20

declared unconstitutional because it needlessly prevents

21

our speech, speech that we are ready, willing, and able to

22

engage in.

From

23

The FEC has also accused my client of violating

24

this statute by virtue of financing a radio advertisement

25

known as Wirth Facts Number 1.

The FEC would like my

1

Client punished for this alleged violation.
Thus, this case presents two important issues to

2

3

the Court.

The first issue was alluded to in this Court's

4

opinion in Buckley v. Valeo 20 years ago.

5

does the First Amendment permit Congress to limit a

6

political party's speech, including speech that contains

7

express advocacy in support of the party's own candidates?

At issue is,

If this Court upholds such a limit, then the

8

second issue is raised, which is, are political parties
10

entitled, at the very least, to clear guidance as to which

11

of its speech is subject to a spending limit and which

12

speech is not?

13

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Baran, I thought there was

14

another possible question here, which is whether the

15

statute as presently drafted covers this expenditure at

16

all.

17

One could -- this was an advertisement, as I

18

understand it, paid for by the Colorado political

1

committee at a time when there was no Republican nominee

20

for the Senate and, indeed, not officially a Democratic

21

nominee, and one could read 441a(d) as not covering that

22

at all.

23

Now, what if we think that's the situation?

24

we reach some constitutional issue, or can we just say,

25

gee, the statute doesn't cover it, and we'll postpone

Do

1

those bigger issues for an occasion when it does?
MR. BARAN:

2

If the Court reached such a

3

decision, Justice O'Connor, it would still leave section

4

441a(d) as limiting some form of speech, speech by my

5

client.
QUESTION:

6

Well, it would, but what do you think

7

our doctrines are on reaching constitutional issues

8

unnecessarily?
MR. BARAN:

9

I believe that in prior cases

10

involving restrictions on campaign speech the Court has

11

addressed specific statutory limitations, including, of

12

course, most expansively in the Buckley decision, but it

13

did so also in the NCPAC decision in terms of evaluating a

14

particular statute under a declaratory judgment request by

15

a party such as my client.
QUESTION:

16

You had a separate counterclaim

17

asking for declaratory judgment and making a facial attack

18

on the statute so that even if we found against the

19

Government's claim, against the Republican Party, we would

20

still have to adjudicate the disposition that was made of

21

your claim against the Commission, which was a facial

22

challenge, as I gather.

23

MR. BARAN:

Yes, Justice Scalia, that is our

24

position.

25

was part of our answer.

We've had a separate discrete counterclaim that

1

the district court focused on that issue as well as the

2

other issues.

3

QUESTION:

And your grievance here is not just

4

that you were punished for this violation, but you don't

5

think you should be subject in the future to this

6

provision at all.

7

MR. BARAN:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes, that is -For purposes of the counterclaim, is

it your position that subsection (d) covers any

10

expenditure that the party might make which is not a

11

coordinated expenditure?

12

MR. BARAN:

That is the interpretation of the

13

statute that we have agreed with the Government on, that

14

this limitation as it was intended, and certainly as it is

15

applied by the Federal Election Commission, applies to

16

both coordinated contributions which are, in fact,

17

coordinated with the candidate and also contributions that

18

may not factually be proved to be coordinated.

19

QUESTION:

Well, I thought the Government's

20

position was that all of your expenditures were

21

coordinated.

22

MR. BARAN:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. BARAN:

25

As a de jure matter, yes.
Yes.

Well, do you agree with that?

Well, we concur with the

congressional judgment that a de jure coordination is good

policy, because it precludes what would otherwise -QUESTION:

2

No, but I just want to know what your

3

position is in the litigation under your facial challenge.

4

Do you agree with the Government that every expenditure

5

you might make that could be subject to subsection (d) is

6

a coordinated expenditure?

Well, we - If it's a matter of --

If you agree that it's a matter of

law, it is, what's left?
MR. BARAN:

16

Well, we have what everyone seems to

17

acknowledge is a unique relationship with candidates.

18

It's unlike other -QUESTION:

19

Yes, but I thought you took the

20

position here that this wasn't a coordinated expenditure.

21

It was at a time when there wasn't even a nominee, and it

22

was an independent expression of viewpoint.

Now, I understood from your briefs that was your
position.

Have you given that up?

Justice O'Connor, that whether -- there was no inquiry by

2

the Federal Election Commission as to whether or not this

3

particular expenditure was coordinated.
QUESTION:

4

No, but this is the facial challenge.

5

It doesn't matter.

6

under (d), do you take the position that every expenditure

7

is a - - every expenditure that you might make, subject --

8

that could be subject to that as a matter of law is a

9

coordinated expenditure?
MR. BARAN:

10
11

For purposes of your facial challenge

We accept that proposition, Justice

Souter.
QUESTION:

12

Well, Mr. Baran, you can't just walk

13

in off the street and make a facial challenge to a

14

statute.

15

some way, certainly.

16

MR. BARAN:

You have to show that the statute affects you in

Well, I don't believe there's any

17

dispute that my client, the Colorado Republican Party,

18

wishes to and indeed does engage in express advocacy in

19

support of its candidates.
QUESTION:

20

But you say even though we find the

21

statute wouldn't apply to the activities that you've been

22

challenged on here, nonetheless you can challenge it

facially?

QUESTION:

2

3

Yes, but you have to have some sort

of standing to challenge a statute even facially.

4

MR. BARAN:

Well, we are a State committee, as

5

defined by this statute, which specifically applies to

6

State political parties and specifically limits our

ability to spend money for some defined speech.

QUESTION:

Now,

In this case you did not name -- you

10

did not name the Democratic candidate that you were

11

opposing because the Democratic candidate hadn't been --

12

or the Republican candidate that you were favoring because

13

the Republican candidate hadn't even been named yet, isn't

14

that right?

15

But in a future case, you might want to go

16

beyond what you did in this case and actually favor a

17

particular Republican candidate, isn't that right?

18
19

MR. BARAN:

That was the claim in the district

court when we made the - -

20

QUESTION:

And this provision would prevent it.

21

MR. BARAN:

I don't think there's any dispute

22

that this provision would apply to us or any other State

committee that wished to engage in covered speech.

1

MR. BARAN:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.
Even if you won with that, you'd

3

still be subject to the limitation that you cannot support

4

a Republican candidate except within the limitations of

5

421(d).

6

MR. BARAN:

7

QUESTION:

That is correct.
But even if you made the expenditure

8

that Justice Scalia referred to, you still take the

9

position that it may be treated, as the Government says,

10

as a coordinated expenditure.

11

MR. BARAN:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, Justice Souter.

Does it follow from that -- and I'm

13

not sure that I'm understanding the terms that everybody

14

uses, so forgive a question that maybe I shouldn't have to

15

ask, but does it follow from your position that if

16

everything that you might expend should be treated as a

17

coordinated expenditure, that therefore every expenditure

18

you make should be treated for constitutional purposes as

19

a contribution to someone?
MR. BARAN:

20

It's our position that it should be

21

evaluated in two ways.

22

how is it labeled under the statute and, of course,

23

Congress has provided certain labels which may, in fact,

24

have - -

One is, of course, what is it --

No, but I thought we've gotten

1

beyond.

I thought we've gotten to the point of your

2

saying, any such expenditure which could be covered by

3

(d), about which we are complaining in the facial

4

challenge, is a coordinated expenditure.

5

So taking that as the point from which the

6

question starts, does it follow from that that every

7

expenditure in question here should be treated for

8

constitutional purposes as a contribution to someone?

9

MR. BARAN:

It should be treated for

10

constitutional purposes under the strict scrutiny that

11

this Court requires, whether --

12

13
14

QUESTION:

Well, how about a yes or no answer?

Should it be treated as a contribution or not?
MR. BARAN:

We don't believe that it should be

15

treated as a contribution in terms of a shorthand

16

resolution of whether or not this satisfies First

17

Amendment - -

18

QUESTION:

Then explain to me the sense of

19

coordinated expenditure that you're using, because I take

20

it you are not using coordinated expenditure to mean

21

coordinated with a particular named candidate, because at

22

the time in question here, and I suppose at other times,

23

there won't be one, so in what sense is it a coordinated

24

expenditure?

25

MR. BARAN:

I believe the answer, Justice

1

Souter, is that it's a coordinated expenditure by virtue

2

of the predicament or situation that political parties

3

in - - are in that no one else is in.

4

QUESTION:

No, but tell me what you mean by

5

coordinated expenditure.

6

it, and as you understand the Government is using it.

7

MR. BARAN:

Define the term as you are using

Well, as I'm using the term, it can

8

be in two contexts, because they are used interchangeably.

9

One is a reference to a factual determination under a

10

provision of section 441a as to whether or not there has

11

been consultation with a candidate and coordination with a

12

candidate.

13
14

At the same time -QUESTION:

But that didn't happen in this case,

I take it.

15

MR. BARAN:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. BARAN:

Er - There wasn't any candidate.
There were three nameless candidates

18

which were referred to in the record, and which are cited

19

in the passages of the Government - -

20

QUESTION:

Well, would it be proper in this

21

case, then, and hence in considering the facial challenge,

22

to consider the expenditure as being coordinated with them

23

and to treat them as candidates?

24

MR. BARAN:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice -Would that be fair?

MR. BARAN:

2

QUESTION:

Yes,

I think --

All right.

If that is fair, then,

3

and that's the sense in which you are using coordinated

4

expenditure - -

5

MR. BARAN:

6

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm.
Then why isn't it the case that every

7

expenditure that would be subject to your facial challenge

8

is one which for constitutional purposes should be treated

9

as a contribution,

from which it would follow that,

in

10

judging the facial validity of the statute, we're really

11

talking about a statute that regulates contributions

12

rather than expenditures.

13
14
15

Maybe there's some point in the logic that I'm
going astray, but I don't see where it is.
MR. BARAN:

I don't believe that the

16

contributions - expenditure dichotomy that's articulated in

17

Buckley falls neatly into this type of situation --

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. BARAN:

20

QUESTION:

Well, then I'm --- by virtue of our -I'm just having trouble understanding

21

the argument, because I thought you had -- you have agreed

22

that it's a coordinated expenditure, that it's coordinated

23

in the sense that it is to be attributed at least to the

24

three, or perhaps to the ultimate winner of the three, and

25

I don't see, once you get to that point, why we're not,

MR. BARAN:

It does not result in a conclusion as to

QUESTION:

Well, it -- I'm not saying what the

conclusion is.

10

MR. BARAN:

11

QUESTION:

I understand that.
I'm just saying, what is the problem

12

about which we must come to a conclusion, and it seems to

13

me that, based upon the premises that you agree to, it

14

must be a problem about contributions.

15

MR. BARAN:

I would say that it could be in the

16

same context as a limit by - - on a candidate which, of

17

course, was reviewed by this Court in Buckley, and whether

18

the candidate spends his or her own money, or whether a

19

candidate does it in coordination with his or her campaign

20

committee doesn't seem to have any constitutional

21

significance once the analysis is conducted of strict

22

scrutiny regarding what kind of speech and what kind of

23

spending is affected by the restriction.

We reserved this precise question in

Buckley, did we not?

MR. BARAN:

I believe that is correct, Justice

QUESTION:

So evidently we did not deem that, if

it is considered a contribution, that's an end of the

matter.

10

That would be our position and,

was with respect to a Fifth Amendment equal protection
claim.
QUESTION:

11

I take it it's your position that

even if it is treated as a contribution, the limit is

13

still unconstitutional.

14

your case away, necessarily, by doing that, but is it fair

15

to treat it as a contribution for analytical purposes

here, based on your premises?

MR. BARAN:

I'm not suggesting that you give

I think it presents difficulty

18

either way because of the nature of the party, the nature

MR. BARAN:

They do not nominate candidates.

2

There is a legal and substantive distinction between

political parties and other participants.

4

distinction doesn't necessarily automatically lead to a

particular constitutional result, but it is a difference

that I believe must be acknowledged, and --

9

QUESTION:

Now, that

So it's like a candidate expenditure,

you're saying.
MR. BARAN:

I believe the closest analogy to

10

this limit is with respect to the relationship of a

11

candidate to his or her own campaign, and the campaign is

12

the candidate's own effort.

13

In this case, in fact, we are being portrayed

14

as, I think one of the amicis called us a joint venturer

15

with the candidates, which is --

16

QUESTION:

But there's this difference, is there

17

not, Mr. Baran, that one who contributes to the candidate

18

is not thereafter blocked from also contributing to the

party, so you can't just put them all in the same pot.

20

MR. BARAN:

MR. BARAN:

Only if you do not designate or

MR. BARAN:

MR. BARAN:

I don't believe that is the case,

16

Justice Kennedy.

17

It has to meet separate criteria legally.

18

A political party is separately defined.

Not only in the Federal Election Campaign Act,

19

but under virtually every State law, there are provisions

20

that specify what a party is, and a party obviously has to

21

have some continuity, and it must have some demonstration

22

of support.

23

It must have nominated candidates, which

candidates then have attracted some level of voter support

as a practical matter go out of existence, or under
virtually every State law, whoever they nominate do not
automatically qualify for the ballot, so there is an
entire statutory body of law at both the Federal and State
level that deals with parties differently.
And that difference is accountable for the fact
that, unlike any other group, they join together, they
call themselves something, they select their members to
run for office, and they present them to the public.
And what this statute does is, it says, well,
once you have done all that, and you want to tell not just
the public but you want to even tell party members why
they should support the candidates you have nominated, the
Federal law says you can only do it up to a limit, and

If the party has all those attributes of what we can

loosely call a State actor, perhaps it should be subject
to more restrictions, quite properly so, than a group of
citizens who form a PAC.

characterizes political party speech as the State's
speech, in that we are actually speaking for ourselves and
our adherents, and hopefully with the support of the

QUESTION:

But that's even more true of private

MR. BARAN:

that of a PAC, is it different from that of a corporation

And our position is that the answer has to be

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DREW S. DAYS, III
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
GENERAL DAYS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I wanted to take a few minutes to just clarify
the scheme that's at work here under the campaign act.
Under the act, an expenditure is defined as

22

something that's extended for purposes of influencing an

23

election, and expenditures are considered coordinated

24

expenditures where a political party is concerned, and if

25

they are coordinated expenditures, then they are viewed as

contributions, which would then be covered by the

2

contribution limits and the doctrines that this Court has

3

announced.

4

The petitioners have accepted this scheme, and

5

accepted that their expenditures should be viewed as

6

coordinated expenditures, so they've accepted this as a

7

theoretical matter.

8

that on this record there's evidence of actual coordinated

9

expenditures.

10

But I would like to point out also

The party chairman in this case admitted that

11

even though there wasn't a Republican candidate at the

12

time, that he was coordinating with all three Republican

13

candidates, and certainly the Federal Election Commission

14

has held for some years - -

there was no candidate nominated, but the party chairman

was coordinating with all three candidates.

QUESTION:

So the Republican Party in power had

not nominated anyone, but several people were angling, or

25

seeking the nomination.

GENERAL DAYS:

1

That's correct, and the Federal

2

Election Commission has pointed out that there's nothing

3

in the act that requires that there have been a nominee

4

selected before this principle applies.

5

itself refers to candidates, it does not refer to

6

nominees, and there are parts of the statute where the

7

Congress has used nominee when it intended to make that

8

point.

The statute

That's not the case in this particular situation.
So we're -- in analyzing this particular

9
10

situation, faced with a coordinated expenditure that is a

11

contribution, it's a form of contribution, it strikes us

12

that the petitioners have refused to accept, Justice

13

Ginsburg, the distinction that this Court has drawn for

14

many, many years, since Buckley, between limiting

15

contributions and limiting expenditures.

that light, it constitutes an expenditure.
To be sure, it's coordinated with the candidate.

2

3

They're sort of saying the party and the candidate are

one.
GENERAL DAYS:

5

Well, I understand their

6

position, but this Court has held that if we're talking

7

about contribution limits, Congress had a compelling

8

justification for imposing such limitations in order to

9

prevent corruption or the appearance of corruption.

So

10

the question is, are the limitations that are imposed on

11

coordinated expenditures in the form of -- or

contributions in the form of coordinated expenditures by

parties subject to that same type of analysis --

rejected that argument and nevertheless saw that as a

12

Mr. Chief Justice, I respectfully

disagree.

I think that what this Court was addressing in

14

the Massachusetts Citizens for Life was the question of

15

how expenditures should be defined, and what this Court

16

concluded was, 1) expenditures in the form of independent

expenditures should be viewed as covered by the act only

O'Connor, what the Federal Election Commission has done in

interpreting the act has 1) concluded that any

really an authorization for the parties to spend more

regular provisions of the act.

2

That is, in this case, it could have spent

3

$100,000, the Republican Party, the petitioners, but

4

decided not to do that, so the contribution limit is one

5

that has to be evaluated using the principles that this

6

Court has announced in Buckley and other cases, and what

7

we are arguing is that Congress' limitation on

8

contributions by political parties is consistent with that

9

norm.

10

Although parties and candidates may share some

11

agreement, there's no reason to think that if, as the

12

petitioners want, there would be unlimited contributions

13

made by the party, that that might not stimulate

14

corruption, or at least the appearance of corruption.

15

And secondly, if this were an open spigot, so to

speak, there might be room for evasion of the individual

Mr. Chief Justice, I suppose one

QUESTION:

curious things about the position that petitioners have

couple of statutory issues that were raised.

Before you get to that, Mr. Baran,

let me tell you one thing that's really troubling me.

it true that it doesn't make a whole lot of difference?

Is

7

Does this make any real difference to

MR. BARAN:

10

Any time the decisionmaking of a

11

speaker becomes his or her own decision as opposed to the

12

Government's decision, it matters, and in practical terms

13

this does allow the political parties to make their

14

decisions based on where they think their political speech

15

would be most effective.
QUESTION:

16

As a practical matter, it would give

17

the parties through this form of speech an influence and a

18

control over candidates which in the last few decades they

19

have lost.

MR. BARAN:

That's the practical effect, isn't it?
It makes them more relevant than

QUESTION:

Isn't that what's really at stake?

2

That's why they want to engage in this kind of speech.

3

You want to restore party discipline.

4

MR. BARAN:

Justice Souter, political parties

5

believe they have a proper role in public debate about

6

campaigns and about issues, and about -- that's what party

7

platforms are about.

8

are all about, and this section tells the parties they can

9

only engage in that public debate up to a point.

QUESTION:

That's what nominating candidates

influence your candidates to support Republican positions

more than they otherwise would.

(Laughter.)

19

MR. BARAN:

Yes.
You're ashamed of that.

I'm too sensitive to perhaps the

20

jargon of some, and I don't mean you, Justice Souter,

21

that, you know, having clout is a pejorative term, and it

22

does allow them to say more and hopefully to have more

23

persuasive effect.

I would point out that with respect to this
assertion that this spending is highly theoretical, the

record is fairly clear that with respect to the 1986

2

election cycle the Colorado party spent $1.1 million for

3

all of its activities, so it is theoretically possible,

4

was then, is today, to spend money, if that were the

5

party's decision, for the type of speech in excess of the

6

limits as provided here.
With respect to when an individual is a

7
8

candidate, which is a very important question raised by

9

Justice Ginsburg, I point out that the definition of a

10

candidate in the Federal Election Campaign Act is any

11

individual who has raised or spent more than $5,000 in

12

campaign funds.
That means that every person across a street is

13
14

a candidate under the act almost the day after election

15

and, in fact, Congressman Wirth, before he became a

16

candidate for the Senate, was, prior to that time, between

17

1984 -- the 1984 election and up to the point where he

18

declared his candidacy for the Senate, he was a candidate

19

for reelection to the House of Representatives.
QUESTION:

Which section defines candidate that

way?
MR. BARAN:

That is section 431, which is a

definitional section of the act, Your Honor, and there is

24

a discrete definition of a candidate.
