CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF I. MICHAEL GREENBERGER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GREENBERGER:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents a question of constitutional

12

13

analysis of section 10 of the 1992 Cable Act, which in

14

turn amended provisions of the Federal Cable Act of 1984

15

that dealt with public and leased access channels on cable

16

systems.

17

It is important to note that public and leased

18

access channels are not a creation of the Federal

19

Government.

20

Broadcasting case just 18 months ago, cable companies owe

21

their very existence to municipalities giving them by

22

contract the rights of way in their community to lay and

23

string their cable.

agreement.

As this Court noted in the Turner

That's encompassed in a franchising

As part of that franchising agreement, that

contract between the municipal government and the cable

2

company, it had become a practice in the sixties,

3

seventies, and eighties for municipalities, without any

4

inspiration from the Federal Government or requirement by

5

the Federal Government, to insist as a condition of

6

allowing entrance of the cable companies and allowing them

7

to speak in the very first instance, that they set aside

8

channels for the public, and those channels were supposed

9

to be used and are used on a first come, first served,

10

nondiscriminatory basis, free of editorial control and, in

11

fact, in the usual case -QUESTION:

12

May I ask you on that one point, is

13

it clear that those channels are offered pursuant to this

14

section within the meaning of the statute we're looking

15

at, when the locality imposes those conditions?

16
17

MR. GREENBERGER:

In other words, does section

10 apply to these channels?

18

QUESTION:

Well, it's the part of subsection (h)

19

that precedes section 10 which was in the statute all

20

along.

language?

23

It says, any cable service offered pursuant to
Does what you described fit within that

I want to be sure.
MR. GREENBERGER:

Yes.

It is definitely -- I

think there's no dispute between the parties that public

and leased access channels are covered by -5

QUESTION:

Even if these restrictions you

2

describe were imposed by the locality rather than the

3

Federal Government?

4

MR. GREENBERGER:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. GREENBERGER:

Yes.

Okay.
As well as insisting upon

7

leased public access channels, as we noted in our reply

8

brief, by 1982 over 350 jurisdictions, municipalities, had

9

insisted that leased channels be set aside.

Those are

10

channels which can be used by people who are interested in

11

doing commercial television and can't get their

12

programming on a regular cable channel.

13

In 1984 --

QUESTION:

instance of municipalities --

You say this came, too, at the

16

MR. GREENBERGER:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Yes.

-- rather than the National

Government?
MR. GREENBERGER:

That's correct.

There was a

20

general feeling and a fear on the part of municipalities

21

when they opened their city for the laying and stringing

22

of cable that they were allowing a kind of monopoly, or at

23

least a bottleneck, into their community with regard to

24

the speech over the cable system, and they wanted to let

25

people unaffiliated with the cable company -- that is, the

1

public in general and people who wanted to use leased

2

access -- to come on and be able to use that free of

3

editorial control by the cable operator.

4

In fact, with regard to public access, most

5

nonprofit public access corporations are appointed by the

6

municipal government itself.

7

responsible for it.
In 1984, when Congress first got involved in

8

9

They're the ones who are

regulating cable, they looked at this process, made

10

extensive studies, had findings in the legislation that

11

this was a good thing, they sanctioned -- they did not

12

require, but they sanctioned the practice of

13

municipalities having pubic access channels, and they did

14

require that they be free from editorial control, but that

15

was already a condition in the franchising agreements

16

themselves.

17

QUESTION:

18

they sanctioned it?

19

Well, what do you mean when you say

MR. GREENBERGER:

They said that communities may

20

have public access programming.

21

require it.

22

didn't say how you had to have it.

23

They did not say, we

They did not say you have to have it.

QUESTION:

2

Are you making this point in order to

3

lead up to your State action argument?

you're laying the groundwork for?
MR. GREENBERGER:

Is that what

Yes, I am leading up to that

point, because --

7

QUESTION:

Because it seems to me there might be

8

State action even if the Government had enacted this

9

statute in the very first instance.
MR. GREENBERGER:

10

I agree with you, Justice

11

Kennedy, and I will address that point, but the one thing

12

I want to make clear is that in banc court of appeals and

13

the Solicitor General's brief refuses to acknowledge what

14

is clear from the record and nobody disputes, is the prior

15

history of there being no editorial control by cable

16

companies over public and leased access.

17

didn't want it.

get on free of editorial control.

They wanted their citizens to be able to

QUESTION:

19

The cities

Well, but you refer to the in banc

20

court.

21

and only two of them agreed with the proposition that

22

there was State action, so two of the dissenting judges

23

thought there was no State action either.

Only -- there were four dissenting judges below,

mistake I think that the nine judges made who didn't agree

with us below is they refused to recognize -- the in banc

2

said the 1984 act took away editorial control in the first

3

instance, it was required by the Federal Government, and

4

all the 1992 act did was restore editorial control.

5
6

The only persons who challenged that were the
two dissenting judges who dissented across the board.

7

Now, our position is the 1992 act, which is a

8

floor amendment without hearings, without studies, without

9

reports, without House consideration, and handled in a

10

matter of minutes on the floor -QUESTION:

What does that have to do with

QUESTION:

Yes.

14

QUESTION:

Does that have to do with the

11

anything?

constitutionality of it?

16

MR. GREENBERGER:

17

QUESTION:

It certainly --

I thought Congress, so long as it

18

passes the words by majority vote, the words can come from

19

nowhere as far as we're concerned.

20

MR. GREENBERGER:

Justice Scalia, when Congress

21

acts against the prohibition of the First Amendment that

22

Congress shall make no law, if it's a content-based

23

discrimination, which we argue this is, there must be a

24

compelling interest and the least restrictive means.

25

QUESTION:

I understand all that.

MR. GREENBERGER:

1

Now, this Court said in Sable,

2

and the plurality repeated again in Turner, that it's not

3

an agency proceeding but there must be some record

4

somewhere, either in the legislative history or in the

5

bill itself -- Congress often makes findings in bills as

6

they did in the '84 act -- that there is a compelling

7

interest -QUESTION:

8

10

You mean, you're saying that the bill

itself has to make a finding that there's a compelling
interest?

11

MR. GREENBERGER:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GREENBERGER:

What I'm saying --

I don't think we've ever held that.
Mr. Chief Justice, I think

14

that this Court has been flexible and said both in Sable,

15

which is the majority opinion of this Court, and in the

16

plurality in Turner, that Congress can do this any way it

17

wants, but when it treads on the rights of the First

18

Amendment it has an obligation to let this Court know some

19

way whether there's a compelling interest and whether the

20

least restrictive means --

21

QUESTION:

Well, it may have to make factual

22

findings, but you can make factual findings in a bill that

23

originates on the floor.

24

Justice Scalia that there's something wrong with a bill

25

that originates on the floor --

MR. GREENBERGER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

I didn't understand that was the -- I agree with you

completely that the findings can be in the bill on the

7

floor and, of course, in this legislation, there were no

8

such findings.

QUESTION:

Wait, I'm -- the findings have to be

MR. GREENBERGER:

QUESTION:

MR. GREENBERGER:

They can be anywhere.

In the floor debate?
In Sable -- I know that you

14

had a separate opinion in Sable, Justice Scalia, but in

15

Sable eight justices of this Court said somewhere in the

16

floor debate, in the hearings, in the bill, somewhere,

17

this Court has to be told that Congress has a compelling

interest.

Justice Scalia, that it can only -QUESTION:

2

It seems to me that a bill that comes

3

to the floor, which has so clearly a compelling interest

4

that it is immediately adopted by acclamation, you're

5

telling me that bill is weaker than one which is debated

6

on the floor.

7

MR. GREENBERGER:

The minority is protected not

8

by acclamation votes but by an explanation that there's a

9

compelling interest, and this Court has insisted that the

10

Congress, when it act pursuant to the First Amendment, if

11

it has a content-based statute, which this statute is,

12

that it outline -- not posit a disease, as Justice Kennedy

13

said in the Turner Broadcasting case, they have to show

14

that there's real harm, and they have to show, if it's

15

content-based discrimination, that the least restrictive

16

means are used.

17

In this case, section 10(a) and 10(c) provide

municipalities didn't want to get involved in this

MR. GREENBERGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, in the

3

Sable case, Justice White said that they could go about it

in any way they want to, but they have to - -

5

QUESTION:

Go about what?

Are you saying that

6

the Congress has to make a finding that what it's doing is

7

the least restrictive way?

8

MR. GREENBERGER:

9

It doesn't have to make a

finding, but it somehow has to allow this Court, when it

10

makes a review, and this Court has frequently said it has

11

independent judgment over what Congress does, not de novo

12

review in this area, but an independent judgment.

13

It has to tell this Court why they're making a

14

law that's abridging freedom of speech, and if it's

15

content-based discrimination, what they have to tell this

16

Court is that there's a real harm, a compelling interest,

17

and that the least restrictive means are being used, and

18

Sable so holds.

19

QUESTION:

You're telling me that Sable holds

20

that Congress has to find that what it's doing is "the

21

least restrictive means"?

22

MR. GREENBERGER:

I - - Sable does, and Sable

23

follows many precedents, Mr. Chief Justice.

24

there must be a record, and --

from which this Court could make that determination is

2

quite different from saying that Congress has to make the

3

determination.
MR. GREENBERGER:

4

No, it's -- the cases make it

5

very clear that it's Congress that's abridging the speech,

6

and Congress must make the record - -

MR. GREENBERGER:

-- and this Court reviews the

record.

10
11

Well, but --

Including, in your view, a finding

that what we are doing is the least restrictive means?

12

MR. GREENBERGER:

13

QUESTION:

I --

I don't recall any case in which I've

14

seen, in the 20 years I've been on the bench, that I've

15

read a record where Congress has said we find what we're

16

doing is the least restrictive means.
MR. GREENBERGER:

17
18

to say it with those exact words.

Your Honor, they may not have

Well, what -- then what are we coming

to?
MR. GREENBERGER:

But they have to say -- for

22

example, in Sable, which dealt with dial-a-porn, which is,

23

we believe, basically a much more serious indecent problem

24

than we're dealing with here, but in Sable the Court said

25

there they had an existing means to regulate the

1

problem -- credit cards, access codes -- and Justice

2

White, speaking for substantial members of this Court,

3

said that in order to put a total ban in effect, which is

4

what Sable did, Congress must somewhere explain to this

5

Court in a meaningful way why the existing regulation is

6

no longer the least restrictive means.
QUESTION:

7

The trouble that I'm having with

8

this, and you may come to this later, in which case at

9

some point -- I just -- is, it seems -- I'm having -- I

10

find this very difficult, this case, in part because it

11

seems to me there are First Amendment rights on both

12

sides.

13

It isn't just that there's a First Amendment

14

right of a person who wants to originate a program of a

15

certain kind and those who want to perhaps see this

particular program.

17

as an editor of a person who provides transmission.

No, I don't feel the same way,

Do they -- how -- that's important,

because it's a question of what framework we think

3

about - -

4

MR. GREENBERGER:

As I mentioned originally, and

5

as this Court■recognized in Turner, to be able to speak in

6

the first instance, cable companies had to come to

7

municipalities and say, we want to get on your property,

8

we want to lay and string cable, before they had any

9

rights to speak.

10

And the municipalities universally -- and

11

Congress recognized this in 1984 -- universally said,

12

fine, but you've got to set aside space for us, public,

13

unaffected -- it's just like a subdivision.

14

set aside parks for the public.

15

set aside some of your channels.

16

QUESTION:

You've got to

They said, you've got to

Now, why -- look, I'm not certain

17

that this is a correct way to view it, but they are people

18

who provide to other people lots of messages, and they

19

have to, of course, use a cable, and NBC has to use a

20

piece of property where they broadcast through the air.

21

The air was controlled by the public, the spectrum was

22

controlled by the public, so is the cable place controlled

23

by the public.

QUESTION:

7

MR. GREENBERGER:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. GREENBERGER:

I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.

Yes.
The First Amendment rights are

10

being dealt with in a completely different case that's

11

like the must-carry case that this Court handled in

12

Turner.

13

So far, the United States Government has taken

14

the position that if the cable operators have any rights

15

with regard to public access and leased access, the

16

discrimination against them is content neutral because

17

there's no content involved, it's first-come, first-

18

served, and the district court has so held.

19

The United States, when it gets up here, has to

20

tell you that it is arguing these cable operators don't

21

have the rights on leased access.
In the Turner case, we had a much harder

22

23

question.

24

the new law makes now that applies across the board to all

kinds - MR. GREENBERGER:

3

Well, with regard to public

and leased access specifically, it did not affect these

5

regulations but did give the cable operator the

6

independent power to ban editorially for obscenity,

7

nudity, or indecency, which would not be affected by this

8

case.

9

With regard to all other channels on the cable,

10

it gave in sections 504 and 505 a right to the parent or

11

the cable subscriber to call in and ask that the cable be

12

blocked from its home.

13

Now, it's -- I will tell you, Justice O'Connor,

I don't pretend to be an expert.

15

that statute about whether you can only block things you

don't subscribe to, or whether you block things that you

And basically, with regard to State action, our

can ban for obscenity, indecency, and now nudity.

QUESTION:

Okay.

So we're faced with a

statutory regime in which it's not the case that the

statute is blank and suddenly Congress says, by the way,

you can censor for indecency.

in which Congress has said, you may not censor, you may

not exercise any editorial control, but you may exercise

it for indecency.

What we've got is a scheme

MR. GREENBERGER:

That's exactly right.

11

Now, one other thing that's important, the cable

franchise agreements won't let us do this.

14

agreements are off of 30 years in the making.

cable operators said, well, in (a) and (c) you gave us

discretion, but if we're bound by the contracts we can't

use our discretion, and the FCC construed the statute and

19

said that Congress intended to preempt not only future

20

franchising agreements, but franchising agreements that

21

were already in existence, and in 1984, Congress was so

22

worried about the expectations in the contracts between

Of course, it's kind of a curious

QUESTION:

So there would be a real incentive

2

for them, then, to think that this is a dandy scheme

3

because they can keep it off the nonaccess channels and

4

make more money by selling their own.

5

MR. WALLACE:

The leased access channels are one

6

which the cable operators also collect a fee from the

7

users of, and that fee can be adjusted based on how many

8

viewers are attracted, what kind of commercial rates the

9

programmer may be able to charge, et cetera.

10

QUESTION:

And those channels are blocked, I

11

take it, unless you pay the fee.

MR. WALLACE:

14

That is --

That's how the cable owner makes his

profit on it.

MR. WALLACE:

come into your home.

MR. WALLACE:

As far as I'm aware.

I'm sorry, I misunderstood.
The lease is a fee-paying

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, I understand your point

10

about the cable operators up to a point, and it's this, if

11

the statute were simply, you can ban it if you want to,

12

that's your judgment, but the argument, as I take it, on

13

the other side is, it isn't pre-choice for the operator.

14

By putting this, or block into, you're pushing the choice.

15

Government is steering the choice in favor of ban rather

16

than to make available.

MR. WALLACE:

addressing that is what we see as the scope of

What Congress thought was in the public

1
2

interest, at least judging by the provisions it enacted,

3

is that because of a consideration this Court recognized

4

in Turner Broadcasting, it's to the advantage of the

5

public to have a multiplicity of sources available to

6

provide programming and therefore the access programming

7

itself, which has to be from unaffiliated sources, that

8

the cable operator is required to carry, is something that

9

serves the public interest.
But Congress was also concerned that an

10
11

operator, a cable operator who is providing these services

12

should not be required against its will to become a

13

purveyor of indecent programming over its system.

14

the one with the direct contact with the consuming public,

15

and providing the service and selling the service, and so

16

Congress thought that the operator should have that

17

option.

18

It is

And our view is that the First Amendment does

19

not require Congress to sacrifice one of those aspects of

20

the public interest to the other, that it can allow this

21

kind of programming to be available on access channels but

22

at the operator's discretion in order to serve both

23

aspects of what Congress reasonably concluded is in the

24

public interest.

for the bill that is under the law as enacted, it is

Was this argument made in the briefs?

10

that the act makes it more clear who is accountable for

But I've been trying to lay the groundwork,

then, to get to the question that Justice Ginsburg put to

me, which is really the argument that was before the court

of appeals.

appeals didn't have to address any First Amendment

intention based upon just the redistribution of authority

itself, and that's why the court of --

10

I mean, what I've said so far is consistent

QUESTION:

But isn't it -- the most vulnerable

11

part of your case is the or block option, because the

12

argument is made, I think loud and clear, that the

13

Government isn't being a neutral arbiter.

14

It is making it tough to give the customer the

15

choice, because it says, if you do, you have to first

16

block, and then you have to turn on, instead of saying,

17

make it available, if the customer doesn't want it, the

18

customer will tell you.

19

MR. WALLACE:

Well, that goes to the 10(b)

20

segregation and blocking requirement, which we have argued

21

is not subject to the strictest scrutiny, but it can pass

22

MR. WALLACE:

State action question in the attack on the conferral of

9

discretion on the operator in 10(a) and 10(c).

10

QUESTION:

It's not the question I meant to

11

address, Mr. Wallace, because I'm powerfully confused by

12

talking about State action when you're dealing with a

statute, and a statute that concerns speech, so that

-- and I don't know how State action

got into this.
MR. WALLACE:

I have explained that of course

19

the readjustment of discretion itself is governmental

20

action that is subject to First Amendment restrictions,

21

but what the argument below was on 10(a) and 10(c) is that

22

while, on the face of it, the operator would be the one

23

deciding whether or not to carry the indecent programming,

24

that could have been the way the 1984 act was written in

25

the first place.

1

It isn't the change in the act that is so

2

crucial here to their argument.

3

that that choice is one where other provisions of the

4

statute and the statutory scheme so weigh on the choice,

5

the Government's thumb is so heavily on the scales

6

encouraging the operator not to carry it, that the private

7

choice has to be attributed to the Government, and is part

8

of what is implicit in the enactment.

9

What they are arguing is

The mere fact that Congress has exercised its

10

commerce power and made rules to govern the relations

11

between private parties that preempt any State law to the

12

contrary is not something unique to this statute.

13

true of any exercise of the Congress' power.

QUESTION:

It's

I would like to understand what your

15

position is on the pushing the cable operator to make one

choice, that is to ban, and also putting the subscriber,

18

list yourself as someone who wants to subscribe to

indecent programming.

problem of possible stigma, but this is something that the

2

cable operator is required to keep confidential.

3

just a way of ordering services that are offered, and

4

those services have been ordered by large numbers of dial -

5

a-porn customers in New York City, for example, as we've

6

pointed out, and as the Second Circuit found in its Dial

7

decision on that, Dial Information Services.
The arguments that are made seem to us not to

8

9

It's

satisfy the test that this Court has laid down.

What --

10

the starting premise on this kind of inquiry about whether

11

a private action can be attributed to the Government is

12

that you can't just start off saying that the Government

13

is required to prohibit, is required by the First

14

Amendment to prohibit a private person such as the

15

operator from refusing to carry it, because that would

16

really be an indirect way of saying that private conduct

17

is itself subject to the First Amendment if the First

18

Amendment requires certain action on the part of the cable

19

operator.

20

So what the Court has said is that the

21

Government can normally be held responsible for a private

22

decision only when it has exercised coercive power or has

23

provided such significant encouragement that the choice

24

must in the law be deemed that of the Government rather

25

than the private actor.

did not impose any legal obligation or material inducement

How much notice does he get?

It

shows up in the weekly TV guide, or whatever it is, we're

18

going to show a certain movie, and they want to see it.

19

How do they - - everybody has to expect

20

MR. WALLACE:

They would have had a blanket -- a

21

notice on a blanket basis that indecent programming on the

22

segregated channels would be made available to that

23

subscriber, and they will get it the way they would get

24

HBO if they're paying the fee for HBO, and the channel

25

would be available to them.

In respect to that, I've one question

on this.

sake of argument I agree with you on that, just for the

4

sake of argument, that they're treating -- they're giving

5

the channels, the cable operator the same kind of

6

discretion in respect to this patently offensive material

7

as NBC, ABC, or newspapers normally have, all right.

8

would take care of (a) and (c).

9

Let me assume that (a) and (c), suppose for the

Now, let's look at (b).

That

That's your assumption.
In respect to (b), I

10

take it the status quo is that a person has a locked box,

11

and he can turn off any indecent program that any cable

12

operator sends, but if the cable operator doesn't

13

originate that program but it comes over a leased channel,

14

then the lock box is irrelevant.

advance.

It's not a question of

Rather, there it's automatically,

All right.

Now, I want to know what sense of

justifying, because there are First Amendment interests on

21

both sides, a rational basis test, how could it be

22

rational, or anything a little beyond rational, if you're

23

a little tougher, to say that 62 channels for their

24

indecent material, it's of course a system where the

person at home turns a key to block it, but for the eight

channels that are leased, in fact to get that the person

at home has to write and give his name 30 days in advance?

Now, I just don't understand.
Edwards' point, I think --

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

9

That was Judge

Right --

-- and I just don't understand the

rationality of that.
MR. WALLACE:

In the first place, the status quo

is not that most consumers have a lock box.

10

QUESTION:

No, no, but --

11

MR. WALLACE:

It's that they can get a lock box

12

if they know of the existence of it and know that there's

13

reason to have one because indecent programming may be

14

coming in which they may not even be aware of.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. V7ALLACE:

17
18

-- lock box?
If you ask for it, and most

consumers do not have a lock box.
The problem that the sponsors of this

19

legislation found was over the access channels, where

20

programming is very unpredictable because you've got

21

different programmers on each hour or half-hour.

22

never know what will be coming over the access channels,

23

and that's where most of the unwanted, uninvited indecency

24

would crop up that there was concern about protecting

25

children from.

You're not going to see it over NBC or PBS

and so on.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Wallace, what's an example of an

access channel in this region?

4

MR. WALLACE:

I don't know of an example in this

5

region.

6

things like the Montgomery County, or one of the

7

university channels that use them for educational

8

programs, and they have been much less of a problem of

9

indecency taking viewers by surprise and suddenly cropping

10
11

What -- well, of course, the PEG channels are

up.
The commercial access channel that's recounted

12

in the record in some detail is Channel 35, the Time

13

Warner channel in New York City, which has practically

14

nonstop indecent programming on it put on by a variety of

15

programmers who come on a first-come, first-served basis.
