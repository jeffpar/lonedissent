ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE DALY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. DALY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
James G. O'Connor had a successful career with

12

the Consolidated Coin Caterers Corporation until the

13

summer of 1990, and at age 56 he was terminated.

14

replaced by a 40-year-old employee.

15

He was

Two weeks before the termination decision was

16

announced to him, and arguably on the day that it was

17

made, his boss came to his office and he said, O'Connor,

18

you are too damn old for this kind of work.

19

little brief colloquy after that, he got up and left.

20

After a

Mr. O'Connor was terminated despite having an

21

exemplary record, both historically and recently.

22

most recent performance evalued was commendable.

23

He had at the end of the preceding year received

24

the largest performance bonus of anybody in the company.

25

He had a better record than his replacement, who had a

1

slightly below average performance evaluation for the

2

preceding year, and who throughout their career had ranked

3

lower in the company salary class classification.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Daly, the question on which we

5

granted certiorari

6

was whether a plaintiff can allege a prima facie case

7

under the Age Discrimination Act by showing that he was

8

replaced simply by a younger person, or does he have to

9

show that he was replaced by someone outside the protected

10

class.

11

MR. DALY:

Thank you, sir, I --

12

QUESTION:

I think some of the facts that you're

13

talking about would be relevant perhaps in the trial court

14

or the court of appeals but less relevant here.

15

MR. DALY:

Well, I appreciate that.

I state

16

them briefly thus because they are such an important

17

background and they focus the importance of the issue,

18

which, as you say, is whether this plaintiff

19

yis going to lose the benefit of the McDonnell Douglas

20

presumption because the person who replaced him is 40

21

rather than 39.

22

QUESTION:

I'm not sure why he needs the

23

presumption, given the facts you've stated.

24

has his employer saying you're too old for this job, does

25

he really need a McDonnell Douglas presumption?

I mean, if he

Wouldn't

•

that be enough to establish a prima facie case?
2

MR. DALY:

In the Fourth Circuit in this case,

3

it was not.

The Fourth Circuit ruled that he did not have

4

a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas because his

5

replacement was not under 40.

6

QUESTION:

Well, I know under McDonnell Douglas

7

he wouldn't have one, but what does it take to establish

8

enough to survive a motion for summary judgment?
MR. DALY:

9

In the Fourth Circuit it takes nexus,

10

and they held that he did not have nexus because, even

11

though under the record it's quite possible that the boss

12

came in and said you're too old for this kind of work on

13

the very day that the decision was made, since he was
fired 2 weeks later, the circuit court said there's not

15

enough nexus.

16

causation.

17

And for that reason, this very meritorious case

18

is dependent precisely and only upon the McDonnell Douglas

19

paradigm in order to succeed.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Daly, I thought that the Fourth

21

Circuit said that that was just a sporadic comment,

22

bantering.

23

few isolated comments, they said.

That's clear evidence of intent.

QUESTION:

8

That's smoking gun
That's a dead

And I take it -- correct me if I'm

wrong -- that if you prevail in your argument on the prima

10

facie case and you obtain a reversal, then you're hoping

11

to be able to trial, and then you can talk about all this

12

evidence.

13

MR. DALY:

That's correct.

14

QUESTION:

All right, but then maybe we should

15
16

What we want is --

get back to the prima facie case.
MR. DALY:

Thank you, Justice Kennedy.

The

17

problem with the under-40 replacement is -- there are

18

several problems with it.

The first problem is that it

19

gives irrational results.

You have a 65-year-old replaced

20

by a 40-year-old, you don't have a prima facie case.

21

have a 41-year-old replaced by a 39-year-old, you do have

22

a prima facie case.

23

QUESTION:

You

Well, do you take the position that,

24

under the McDonnell Douglas framework, a plaintiff has to

25

show that he was replaced, or she, by a younger worker, or

•

do you adopt what the SG appears to be arguing, that a

;

plaintiff doesn't have to prove that he was replaced at

3

all in the McDonnell Douglas framework?
MR. DALY:

4

one we need to prevail on to prevail in this court is the

6

first one, that you just need a younger replacement.

8

QUESTION:

But obviously you're going to have to

articulate what's required.

You have no position --

9

MR. DALY:

I --

10

QUESTION:

-- on which is the better approach?

11

MR. DALY:

Our position is that all you need to

12

do in this case is to say that the replacement was

13

younger, and leave for a later day the case that's not
presented, which is the case of whether there needs to be

15

any showing about the characteristics of the replacement

16

at all.

17

QUESTION:

Is your position as uncompromising as

18

it sounds when you say you need only allege replacement by

19

a younger person, or do you mean that there must be a

20

replacement by a person sufficiently younger so that it

21

might reasonably be the case that age had been the reason?

22

If somebody 55 is replaced by somebody 54, are you going

23

to say that's enough?

24
25

MR. DALY:

Yes, although that's not the case

presented here.

QUESTION:

I realize.

2

MR. DALY:

It's a difficult line to draw, as all

3
4

lines are difficult to draw, but -QUESTION:

Or another way to put it would be

5

that the result is irrational, which is what you charge

6

the -- your opponent's position would be.

7

that this is any less rational, to say that firing

8

somebody 54 and replacing them with somebody 53-1/2

9

establishes a prima facie case.

10

MR. DALY:

I don't see

That's just not rational.

It really plays into the alternate

11

argument that you shouldn't require anything at all.

12

is a characteristic that sometimes is not within the

13

knowledge of the person who is replaced.

14

didn't know, for instance, who replaced him when he first

15

came into my office.

16

Mr. O'Connor

We only found it out in discovery.

But as to your question of the 56-year-old who

17

is replaced by the 55-1/2-year-old, I understand that

18

creates some difficulties at the edges.

19

creates more difficulties not to do it that way.

20

start talking about substantially younger, then you've

21

just made a litigation minefield.

22

This

QUESTION:

I think it
If you

As I understand the effect of this

23

prima facie case, it is to entitle the plaintiff to

24

judgment if the employer does not come forward with an

25

explanation.

Isn't that correct?

MR. DALY:

1
2

That is the correct statement, along

with St. Mary's.
QUESTION:

3

Is there no due process limitation

4

upon that?

I mean, you're telling me if I fire someone

5

who's 41, within the protected class, and you don't even

6

know who I replaced him with -- I might have replaced him

7

with someone 60, you say -- that's enough to establish a

8

prima facie case, the mere fact that I fired somebody 40,

9

and if the employer doesn't come up with a reason for

10

firing him --or, I mean, maybe he just got up on the

11

wrong side of the bed.

That's not a reason.

12

He just doesn't come up with a reason.

13

I don't want to come up with a reason, and you think that

14

we can give judgment for the plaintiff in a case like

15

that?

IS

MR. DALY:

Precisely yes.

He says,

That's nothing more

17

than what Mcdonnell Douglas says.

18

than what mandatory rebuttable presumptions do every day.

19

QUESTION:

That's nothing more

That seems to you like due process of

20

law.

established by a preponderance of the evidence, arguably

22

established by a preponderance of the evidence, that the

reason you fired this person who was 40 was that he was

1

employer articulates no explanation, which is the very

2

unusual case, that presumption would establish enough to

3

go to the jury and if the jury believed, on that evidence

4

alone, that there had been age discrimination, then under

5

this Court's precedents and the test we announced, you

6

could get a judgment, just as --

7

QUESTION:

Have we held that the presumption

8

applies, that the McDonnell Douglas presumption, the prima

9

facie case rule, applies in an ADEA case?

10

MR. DALY:

No, you have not held that.

11

QUESTION:

I take it that the respondent -- and

12

correct me if I'm wrong, how you interpret his brief --

13

doesn't take issue with that.

14

that the McDonnell Douglas prima facie case rule should

15

apply in an ADEA case, and we've never held that, have we?

16

MR. DALY:

No.

Both parties seem to assume

There's a dictum in the dissent

17

in the St. Mary's case that assumes that.

18

circuits have held it.

19

McDonnell Douglas prima facie case paradigm applies to age

20

cases.

21

v. Pons case says that these statutes are drawn from the

22

same fundament, and basically McDonnell Douglas is a

23

method of organizing the proof in a discrimination case.

All 12 circuits have held that the

All of the parties agree with it.

think about it.
Basically, what you're saying is that we're

2

3

making an empirical judgment that most people that are 40

4

years of age or older and that are terminated are

5

terminated by reason of their age.

6

difficult.

7

some other criteria before the prima facie case applies.

9

I recognize that there are some other tests,

MR. DALY:

8

I find that rather

Well, I don't think you're making

that much of an empirical judgment, because as a

10

litigation practicality, once -- there's almost always a

11

statement of, an articulation of a reason by the employer.
QUESTION:

12

Why would there be, because this

13

applies not just to dismissals, it's also refusals to

14

hire, isn't it, and it's also when you reduce force and

15

you have two people doing the job of four, and so why -- I

16

mean, and it's the same problem whether or not you are

17

interested in the question before this Court, because

18

somebody 40 years old is not hired, and they hire somebody

19

39-1/2 years old.
The employer -- you say to your employer, what's

circumstances you're saying McDonnell Douglas requires

this to go to the jury, so for -- I mean, there's no other

evidence in the case?

MR. DALY:

Well, is it very odd that people

sometimes hire people where there are very equally

qualified, and one is a few months older than the other,

and you don't really know why, you just thought this was a

10

little better, this person, you're not sure?

11

really?
MR. DALY:

12

Is that odd,

I'm sure it happens, but the function

13

of the presumption is to set out the generality of cases

14

in which we have identified factors that, as a due process

15

matter, allow you to say with some assurance that it is

IS

more likely than not that there's been a prohibited

reason.

QUESTION:

Mr. Daly, you said that all of the

circuits adopt the McDonnell Douglas test, but they don't

22

and some of them don't -- some of them say, the person

that and say, and there must be a decent interval distance

25

in the age of the person not hired or not promoted and the

1

person hired or promoted.
So to say that it's McDonnell Douglas and the

2

3

circuits are uniform gives a false picture, does it not?
MR. DALY:

4

To that extent, you are correct that

5

the circuits have not absolutely adopted the McDonnell

6

Douglas test as written, except for the First Circuit in

7

the Loeb case and the Banco Santienda case most recently.

8

They say that you don't consider the age of the

9

replacement, or the characteristics of the replacement at

10
11

all.
Nine other circuits, and sometimes the Sixth

12

Circuit, have one or another form relations younger,

13

substantially younger, younger enough to create an

14

inference of discrimination.

15

My position, the petitioner's position, is that

16

simply younger is the best choice of those various

17

competing formulations.

18

QUESTION:

It embraces the case that a couple of

19

my colleagues are talking, where someone 55, 56 is

20

replaced by someone 55, where it certainly isn't a

21

rational presumption, it doesn't seem to me.

22

MR. DALY:

When someone 56 is replaced by

someone 55, it is entirely possible that the motive is age

discrimination.

replacement is a flawed proxy.
In a large corporation, if a middle manager gets

2

3

terminated, sometimes you call Human Relations and you

4

say, send me another middle manager, and sometimes there's

5

a large gap of time.
QUESTION:

6

But are you saying that it is the

7

most logical assumption, if someone 56 is replaced by

8

someone 55, that there's been discrimination because of

age?

MR. DALY:

Yes.

outside the protected class, period?
MR. DALY:

That's correct.

We prevail under

3

that standard.

4

would allow us to prevail, we particularly argue in favor

5

of the younger standard, as opposed to the younger enough

6

to create an inference, or the 10-year standard, which was

7

proposed by somebody.

8

9

Out of all the possible standards that

But you are quite correct, we'd prevail on any
of the above standards, as long as you don't adopt the

10

irrational under-40 standard which, of course, is just a

11

road map to how to avoid the application of the statute.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Daly, I want to get clear --

13

going back, I guess, to your original answer to Justice

14

Scalia's question, I want to get clear on what you think

15

happens in applying the so-called prima facie case rule,

16

or presumption rule.

17

As I understand it, you don't take the position,

18

and I don't know that anybody's taking the position that

19

if the employer -- if the employee simply proves

20

qualification, continuing existence of the job and, let's

21

say, replacement by a younger person, that that entitles

22

the employee to judgment.

23

The employee is not entitled to anything at that

24

point, as I understand it, except, under McDonnell

25

Douglas, a reason from the employer, right?

1

MR. DALY:

Yes, exactly, an articulation.

2

QUESTION:

Okay.

Now, if the employer stands

3

mute and says, I don't know why, then you take the

4

position, and I guess McDonnell Douglas does, that

5

considering the employer's incapacity to give a reason,

6

which does not trench on the forbidden category, that is

7

enough to get to the jury, right?

8

MR. DALY:

Right.

9

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, if the employer does

10

give a reason, as I understand it, therein -- and let's

11

say in this case an age-neutral reason -- all that does is

12

dissolve the presumption, and whether you get to the jury

13

or don't get to the jury is going to depend on other

14

things, I suppose.

MR. DALY:

Right.

It's going to depend on what else you

That's correct.
Well, you agree with the court of

that it would require a finding that that person's age,

2

not someone else's age, be they 25 years younger, or 6

3

months younger, but that the plaintiff's age played a

4

difference in -- made a difference in that decision, and

5

not only played a part, but had a determinative influence

6

in that.

7

The problem with simply talking about younger,

8

whether it's substantially younger or any younger, is that

9

that focuses excessively, in our view, upon the age of a

10

younger person.

that's what he's --

QUESTION:

Well, if we're going to resort to

would think could properly lead the factfinder to infer

9

MR. SPEARS:

I don't see how these distinctions

All we're saying is that those

10

distinctions alone should not be sufficient to establish a

11

prima facie case.

12

If the plaintiff, for example, shows

circumstantial evidence of a different treatment based on

the plaintiff's age -- it could be other experiences the

QUESTION:

Well, you keep talking about that.

8

The McDonnell Douglas so-called factors are several in

number and, as I understood it, anyway, the Fourth Circuit

20

thought everything was met except there was not an

21

allegation of replacement by someone younger than 40.

22

MR. SPEARS:

Well, there was an allegation, and

23

that was the heart, the center of the plaintiff's case,

24

and they felt, because the actual replacement was within

the protected age class, that did not meet its test.

1

May I ask a question about -- we're

2

arguing all about McDonnell Douglas now.

3

Douglas, as I read the opinion, did not require, as an

element of the prima facie case, that you prove that the

replacement was not a member of the protected class.

There's nothing to that effect in the McDonnell Douglas

opinion.

think has occurred, and said different claims, different

occurred, employment opportunities with other employers,

3

and because that was the claim of the plaintiff, therefore

4

the court designed the prima facie test around those facts

5

and contingents.

6

That's what McDonnell Douglas directs, I think,

7

in footnote 13, Justice Ginsburg, and that flexibility is

8

exactly what the Fourth Circuit I believe has

9

demonstrated.

10

QUESTION:

The one requirement of McDonnell

11

Douglas that hasn't been emphasized very much in the

12

argument so far is one of the elements of the prima facie

13

case is to prove that the person is qualified for the job,

14

which then you say, why did you fire him?

IS

generally raise the question, why did you fire a qualified

16

person, and one possible answer is, well, he's a member of

17

a protected class, and then the employer comes in and says

18

otherwise, it's not true.

19
20

But it's important that the plaintiff must prove
that he or she was qualified for the position.

21

MR. SPEARS:

MR. SPEARS:

Justice Ginsburg, the court did get

to that because of the Rule 56 summary judgment motion.

6

Justice Ginsburg, the entire case

But isn't that the issue on which we

granted cert?
MR. SPEARS:

7

That is the issue on which we

granted cert, but I don't think that can be viewed in a

9

vacuum here with regard to why the plaintiff lost.
QUESTION:

10

Well then maybe, if plaintiff lost,

11

if that's an irrelevant question, if plaintiff lost

12

independent of the answer to that question, then I suppose

you're telling us we should not have granted review.
MR. SPEARS:

upon, whether you should or shouldn't.

We just assume for a minute -- this is where I'm actually

Suppose I were to assume

against you that this thing of considering the 39-year-

sense, and the reason that you -- it's the protected class

13

versus the nonprotected class, actually it doesn't make

14

any sense.

Suppose I thought that.

15

I'd still have to say whether you make out this

16

prima facie case if there's a substantial age difference,

17

or you made it out if there's any age difference, and

18

that's what they were -- both the SG says substantial, I

think, and a lot of them say substantial in the circuits,

anyway, but your opponent has said no, any age difference.

Now, I would have thought substantial, until I

heard him argue.

Then he said, look, it doesn't matter

that much if there's only a year difference.

It just wants to focus upon one

In Hicks --

QUESTION:

Because I think you're probably right

that ordinarily when an employer fires someone who's been

15

says is, when you're replacing a 65-year-old you have to

give a 67-year-old as much of a chance as 50-year-old.

And you cannot discriminate between the two.

QUESTION:

Franklin was right.

we want to do, and employers do that, too.

7

thing that McDonnell Douglas is addressing is, in fact, an

8

admittedly very strange situation in which the employer

9

can't come up with any reason at all.

That's all I'm saying.
Isn't it fair to say that -- Benjamin

And the only

And in that case, when qualification has been

10
11

proven, when the existence of a job has been proven, when

12

we will assume some age differential has been proven, all

3

McDonnell Douglas is saying is, there's something very

4

strange here if he can't come up with any reason at all,

5

and therefore the reason probably is the age -- in this

6

case, the age differential.

That's all McDonnell Douglas is saying, isn't
it, and is that so contrary to the laws of nature?

realities of life are necessarily implicated in that.

You're simply basing your position on

the fact that a line has got to be drawn somewhere or your

presumption starts getting useless.

Well, not that a line has to be

drawn, but the line drawn by Congress is the appropriate

line, not some other arbitrary or different line.

MR. SPEARS:

QUESTION:

-- drew the right line.
But not because Congress intended

that there would be no liability under the age act in the

event that the person hired was, himself, within the

MR. SPEARS:

That's not our position, and

there's an EEOC guidance on that.

morning was the third mode that the Fourth Circuit used,

was found lacking under all three of these measures.

The Fourth Circuit readily accommodates the

McDonnell Douglas paradigm if it has to be used to the

realities of life.

We think that's important.

Footnote 13 to McDonnell Douglas indicates, and

the facts and contentions of the parties, and we think
