ORAL ARGUMENT OF LENARD G. WEISS

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WEISS:

10
11
12

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The issue here is,

can the court of appeals

13

refuse, on jurisdictional grounds,

14

interlocutory, qualified immunity appeal solely on the

15

grounds that it is the second such appeal?

16

to hear an

There are two Bivens claims pleaded in this case

17

before the Court, one, a job termination claim that the

18

plaintiff says he has a constitutionally protected

19

property interest in his contingent employment with

20

Pioneer Savings and Loan, and was deprived of due process

21

when that - - when Pioneer terminated him, and the second

22

claim is that he had a constitutionally protected liberty

23

interest in pursuing other employment in the financial

24

services industry which was impaired by the stigmatizing

25

circumstances of his departure from Pioneer.

On the first interlocutory appeal to the Ninth

1

2

Circuit in this case, following a motion to dismiss and

3

prior to discovery, the Ninth Circuit did three things:

4

it announced its categorical one-appeal jurisdictional

5

rule, it affirmed the district court's denial of qualified

6

immunity as to the job search claim, the first claim, and

7

it revived a previously dismissed job termination claim.
Excuse me, I may have misspoken.

8

9

It affirmed

the job search finding by the lower court and revived the

10

job termination claim, which had been dismissed on a

11

statute of limitations basis.
On remand, after full discovery, petitioner

12

13

moved for summary judgment on his qualified immunity

14

defense to the Bivens claims, and that motion was denied

15

on both claims.
In the Ninth Circuit, the Court dismissed

16
17

petitioner's second interlocutory appeal for lack of

18

jurisdiction solely on the basis of its previously

19

announced one-appeal rule.
I would like to make several

20

points.

First,

21

this case fits squarely within the appealable orders

22

criteria of the Mitchell case.

23

rule effectively emasculates the qualified immunity as

24

immunity from suit, pretrial and litigation burdens of

25

suit.

Second, the one-appeal

3

Thirds, the concerns over abuse and judicial
economy are misplaced.
QUESTION:

Well, how many times is a district

4

court expected to entertain a motion for summary judgment

5

in the same case?

6

MR. WEISS:

Normally, I -- normally a summary

7

judgment motion in the same case will only occur on one

8

occasion, and normally the district courts that I practice

9

in front of are very careful about scheduling when summary

10

11

judgment will occur and will not occur.
QUESTION:

So your question arises when there's

12

been an appeal from a motion - - a denial of a motion to

13

dismiss, then the second time around on summary judgment?

14

MR. WEISS:

Precisely, and usually it comes up

15

in the context of a motion to dismiss, because the

16

question is whether the law is settled or not, and

17

sometimes that is a relatively easy question to answer.

18

Perhaps it would have been in this case.

19

thought so.

We would have

20

If it does -- if that's not clear, then you have

21

to go through some discovery, at least, and go through the

22

motion for summary judgment stage.

23

QUESTION:

In that kind of case, where there's

24

an argument at the motion to dismiss stage, and yet there

25

is some indication that further pleadings and discovery

1

will elucidate the issues, does the district court have

2

the authority to say, I want all summary judgment motions

3

relating to sovereign immunity deferred until 6 months of

4

discovery has gone by, I'm not even going to rule on the

5

motion to dismiss, or must he rule on the motion to

6

dismiss?

7

MR. WEISS:

A question I'm not certain of the

8

answer, Your Honor, but I believe the court must respond

9

to the motion to dismiss.

10

It is an attack on the

pleadings --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WEISS:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- prediscovery.
Well, wouldn't you argue that,

14

because I mean, one of the things that -- or wouldn't the

15

argument be that one of the protections is a protection

16

against discovery, so if that's going to be the case, then

17

necessarily the argument would be, rule on the motion to

18

dismiss first?

19
20

MR. WEISS:

Certainly in the context of

qualified immunity --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. WEISS:

Yes.
-- which this Court seems to have

23

made clear is an important remedy or defense, and a

24

protection from the rigors of litigation, of which

25

discovery is the worst, perhaps.

Turning to my first point, if this case were

1

2

the -- if this were the first interlocutory appeal in this

3

case, it would clearly be -- it would fit squarely within

4

the category of appealable orders described by this Court

5

in Mitchell and in Cohen, so if this were the first

6

appeal, no question in our view --

7

QUESTION:

You use the term, interlocutory

8

appeal.

9

final judgment, in fact.
MR. WEISS:

10
11
12

Actually, you do contend it's an appeal from a

Honor.

Under 1291, that's correct, Your

This is a variant on that -QUESTION:

And having used that word, it prompts

13

this question in my mind:

14

rule might be right -- I don't know -- and then you've had

15

one appeal the first time, could you have asked the

16

district judge for a 1292(b) certification to get an

17

interlocutory appeal, as you use the term?

18

MR. WEISS:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. WEISS:

QUESTION:

assuming the Ninth Circuit's

Yes.
You could.
You always have -So there's always at least a

22

safeguard in a really unusual case that perhaps you could

23

get a second bite at the apple.

24
25

MR. WEISS:

Well, as this Court probably well

knows, it is very unusual for 1292(b) certifications (a)

1

to occur at the district court, and even far rarer for

2

them to occur at the court of appeals level.

3

Both courts have to exercise their discretion,

4

and in one of the articles we cited by Professor Solemini,

5

he points out, I believe, that something less than 5

6

percent of the cases in which the district court actually

7

certifies, less than 5 percent of those are actually

8

accepted by the court of appeals so it's not a very
practical - QUESTION:

10

No, because -- that's because there

11

is a sort of a basic policy disfavoring piecemeal

12

appeals --

13

MR. WEISS:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Sure.
-- that either -- that's the

background.
MR. WEISS:

Which is also one of the underlying

17

philosophies behind the Cohen rule and its application in

18

qualified immunity cases.

1

QUESTION:

If you have a cases in which there's

20

a motion to dismiss, and there's an appeal, and the

21

alleged Government defendant loses the appeal, and then

22

there's more discovery and he appeals again, in a way you

23

can say that the second factor of Cohen has not been

24

satisfied, because the defendant takes the appeal on the

25

first go-around on the theory that this will be

1

dispositive of the case, and he's wrong.
MR. WEISS:

2

Well, he's wrong because as a matter

3

of law the court has found that the law is settled or

4

unsettled.

That's the only issue on a motion to dismiss.
Following discovery, the issue turns as to

5
6

whether or not the behavior of the Government defendant

7

was reasonable behavior in light of that settled law.

8

It's a different issue after -QUESTION:

But my point is that the defendant

10

was wrong on the first appeal, because it didn't

11

conclusively dispose of the case.

MR. WEISS:

Well, but the thing he's trying is a

different thing.

He's trying a different issue on the

The

1

court of appeals says, yes, it does.
So now you go back, and now you can only get a

2

subset of the facts, and once again the defendant says the

4

same thing.

5

The district court says, yes, it does.

6

Now, can he get another appeal?

Of course.

7

course it's a little bit different.

of the facts that were there in the complaint.

MR. WEISS:
QUESTION:

10

Of

Now you have a subset

It'S -But if that's enough, I don't see --

11

my problem is, I don't see how that satisfies the separate

12

issue.

13

There are four -- I -- we just wrote on this

14

last year, and what I'm having is seeing how this -- the

15

two appeals there satisfy the test that came down in

16

Cohen, that it should really be quite separate from the

17

rest of the case.

18

That means really very separate.

MR. WEISS:

Well, of course, it is if you - if

19

your first appeal is following a motion to dismiss on the

20

pleadings and you're dealing only with the pleadings, you

21

now have a developed record, and in this case there are --

22

several facts emerge from tie record --

23

QUESTION:

Yes, and if, in fact, you then have a

24

56(f) response to a motion for summary judgment, and then

25

1

get a few more, and then there's another 56(f), then we

2

get another affidavit, and I mean, you could have 50

3

appeals on that theory, couldn't you?

4

MR. WEISS:

I think that's purely theoretical.

5

It's not -- the only thing --

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. WEISS:

I've seen a lot of 56(f) cases.
Well, the only thing that's

8

appealable on the second qualified immunity appeal is

9

whether or not the behavior of the Government defendant

10

was objectively reasonable or not, given the settled law.
QUESTION:

11

Each time the difference is not the

12

legal -- the only thing that's changed is the facts that

13

you take as the predicate for asking the question.

14
15

MR. WEISS:

Well, in the Johnson case, the facts

were heavily disputed.

The law --

QUESTION:

First, you take the facts as they are, might be

We could have no dispute as to facts.

stated in the complaint, which is vague.

19

MR. WEISS:

20

QUESTION:

Correct.
The only difference is, later on the

21

56 motion there's a subset of facts, those that could be

22

proved, given discovery, and the third time, after you

23

went back under 56(f), you have a slightly different

24

subset of facts, so what's changed is the factual

25

predicate.

MR. WEISS:

1

I think the rather

I think the

2

response to that, Your Honor, is that district court is

3

going to say -- and they all do this, as I'm familiar --

4

on 60 -- or 6 months from now in a scheduling order, we

5

will have motions for summary judgment, period, thirty

6

days from now we'll have motions to dismiss, and in

7

between we'll have discovery.
And that's the way this is handled in any court,

I thought, Mr. Weiss, that your

facts, and hence a totally different issue of law.

MR. WEISS:

2

QUESTION:

Well, it is -The decision based on just the

3

pleadings is simply a decision that when you say, I was

4

seriously injured, that states a cause of action, because

5

conceivably some facts could be brought out that show that

6

that's enough.

8

What happens at the later stage is that the
serious injury consists of no more than depriving you of

MR. WEISS:

12

QUESTION:

13

In this case -And that's a different issue of law,

whether that is something that can be sued on.

14

MR. WEISS:

Exactly.

In this case, as an

15

example, concerted action by defendants is alleged in the

16

complaint.

17

After discovery is completed -- completed in

18

this case, the only evidence of any kind of concerted

action is a unilateral sending of Mr. Behrens' letter to

MR. WEISS:

QUESTION:

MR. WEISS:

Not at all.
No.
In the first instance, the court

5

found -- improperly, we think, but found that there was

settled law here.
QUESTION:

8

There --

you've been talking on a highly abstract plain -MR. WEISS:
QUESTION:

10
11

Can you come back to that, because

Yes.
-- and I'm having difficulty

understanding the basic underlying claims.

12

There are two Bivens claims.

13

MR. WEISS:

14

QUESTION:

15

them, or are they different?

Correct.
Does the same law govern both of

I know one is for losing a job and the other is

16
17

for the inability to get a future job, but what law --

18

what is the content of the substantive rule that applies

1

to each of those claims, the same rule, different rule, or

20

what?
MR. WEISS:

21

They are derivative, one of the

22

other.

The underlying issue was a resolution by the

23

Federal Home Loan Bank that said this savings and loan was

There followed from that the hiring of

Mr. Pelletier.

There followed from that Mr. Behrens'

4

letter saying that he ought to step aside pending an

5

investigation that was underway for Mr. Pelletier's

6

previous employer, Beverly Hills Savings, which had gone

7

under at that point.
So then Mr. Behrens' says, you've caused me to

8

be fired.

That's a job loss, suing for due process

10

violations there, and in addition, because people learned

11

of the circumstances of my departure, I've also had my

12

reputation stigmatized by that fact, and I'm entitled to a

liberty interest in that reputation.

Correct.

QUESTION:

-- right?

MR. WEISS:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
And on the motion to dismiss, you

argued there is no such constitutionally protected
property interest because the employment was subject to
Federal regulatory approval.
MR. WEISS:

Correct.

There was also a statute of limitations argument
which was sustained here.

That issue --

QUESTION:

So is that issue still here, or gone?

MR. WEISS:

That issue has never been on appeal

on the question of qualified immunity.
The job termination claim, because it was
dismissed the first time on statute of limitations
grounds, when it went to the Ninth Circuit the first time,
the Ninth Circuit said, district court, I think there's
some recent law that changes the statute of limitations,
and when it went back down on remand after the first -- so

As this case shows, there are clearly

because it cuts off valid qualified immunity defenses even

You must have known they were there.

Why didn't

you -- the silence is deafening with respect to those.
MS. PILLARD:

Well, this really -- I may have

21

created some confusion on this, but it goes, I think, to

22

the issue that Justice Souter raised about whether,

23

because the immunity right is a substantive right, could

it be contracted, the right to appeal denial, be

25

contracted by rule-making?

We certainly think that that would be the

procedure.

If the court were to arrive at the conclusion

that it's not a substantive right, it would be most

appropriately done by rule, but I also don't think that it

He did argue it.

The court of appeals decided

not to reach it, and fortunately the court of appeals in a

the plaintiff was unable to raise in an interlocutory

that the right to an interlocutory appeal here, which is

to eliminate the trial entirely.

7

because you'll lose the case, perhaps, but I thought the

8

theory was that there is a rule under Cohen, which
governed Mitchell, which says that you only get the appeal

10

if the thing you're appealing on resolves an important

11

issue completely separate from the merits, which is

12

effectively unreviewable.

13

So the first time a person appeals from the

separate and conclusive compared to his later appeal for

denial of summary judgment.

QUESTION:

Then you are looking at

But if it's not that important, why

did we recognize it in the first place?

8

MR. REES:

We recog -- I'm sorry.

9

This Court recognized the qualified immunity

10

issue the first time and allowed an interlocutory appeal

11

as an exception under Cohen because after balancing those

12

issues they thought it was important not only because of

13

the defendant's right to avoid discovery, but also the

14

defendant's right to avoid trial --

QUESTION:

Mr. Rees --

16

MR. REES:

-- and it was a single appeal issue.

17

QUESTION:

The -- you start out with a one-

18

appeal rule, and that has the kind of a flavor of a

19

legislative measure rather than a court-type doctrine, and

20

then, well, I asked Ms. Pillard why didn't the Government

21

seem to think this was a matter for rule-making, and she

22

said, well there's this Mitchell -- but there have been

23

privileges before, most famously perhaps the work-product

24

privilege, that start out with a court doctrine.

in the Federal rules after.
So why isn't the appropriate thing now for the

2

3

courts to use the rule-making authority that Congress gave

4

them rather than to say, oh, we're going to pick a one-

5

appeal rule or a two-appeal rule, and we're going to try

6

through adjudication to have that kind of a legislative

7

field rule.
MR. REES:

8

9

We do not disagree with the court's

power to fashion a rule which allows the escape route for

10

the exceptional case, be it under the rule-making power,

11

be it under 1292(b), be it under the power that says,

12

except in extraordinary circumstances there's only one

13

appeal, because one appeal will resolve the purely legal

14

issue and protect the rights of the governmental defendant

15

to avoid both discovery and trial while at the same time

16

protecting the interests of the plaintiffs and the

17

judicial system, because every time there is an appeal,

18

there is a cost in this system, and there is the cost of

19

the system of taking these seriatim appeals.
QUESTION:

20

There -- surely there are deterrents.

21

I mean, if it is frivolous it can be sanctioned, can it

22

not?

MR. REES:

After the fact.

MR. REES:

2

Well,

it doesn't help the plaintiff,

3

and I think if - - Justice Scalia,

look at this case, where after 7 years we're still not up

5

to an appeal -- or, a trial, and we've still only done one

that was involved has been abolished, all the witnesses

have scattered to the four winds -QUESTION:

In addition to sanctions,

QUESTION:

Yes, but that's the first place where

3

Congress -- it was even before adding to the 1292.

In

2072, Congress in 1990 gave the courts authority which

they've never used to deal with the 1291 type.

Yes.

- - type.

10

MR. REES

And I've said, I believe that it is

11

perfectly permissible to utilize the rule-making authority

12

to handle the problems with the exceptional case and give

13

the governmental defendant who has a legitimate claim for

14

a second interlocutory appeal that opportunity, and I

15

think it can be done under rule-making, I think it can be

16

done under case interpretation, just the same way Mitchell

17

allowed the interlocutory appeal in the first instance,

and I think it can -- the escape valve is there --

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose they would argue that

it's not because it's actually the stronger of the cases

2

that wasn't ruled upon, but not only that, I mean, the

3

fact of the matter is, it's not going to conclusively

determine that issue, because Mr. Behrens will still go to

He will go to trial with regard to that.
At best, the only thing that the second appeal

is going to do is reduce the scope of the issues to be
tried, and probably not do that terribly effectively.
QUESTION:

And that's not enough, you say,

under -- to invoke the exception -- the Cohen exception.
MR. REES:

Well, under this Court's reasoning,

14

as this Court did it in Johnson and in Mitchell and in

15

Cohen, and in Digital --

16

QUESTION:

The problem is, if that's not enough

No.

Why not just -- why not all issues?

Well, we're not allowed to take the

MR. REES:

Then you would have had --

I could have asked for a 1292(b)

No.

No, Your Honor.

That was a

misstatement by Mr. Weiss, I believe.

The actual claims

here are substantive --a substantive due process claim

and a procedural due process claim, both of which claims

asserted both a liberty and property interest.
The only thing that happened with regard to the

you make one claim that will survive a qualified immunity

MR. REES:

No.

What I'm saying is, at the point

the appeal should resolve

So so long as one of the claims is

you've got one good claim, you can thereupon pile on as
