ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. SHEEHY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHEEHY:

8

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, good

morning, members of the Court:
The Court has granted review in this case on two

10
11

issues.

12

Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure supersede

13

the forthwith service requirement of the Suits in

14

Admiralty Act?

15

First, does the 120-day service requirement of

Number 2, if not, does the district court have

16

authority to extend the time for service provided under

17

the Suits in Admiralty Act under appropriate

18

circumstances?

19

Petitioner Henderson submits to the Court that

20

the answers to both questions are in the affirmative, and

21

would request this Court to reverse the judgments of the

22

lower courts and remand this case for trial on the merits.

23

First, the 120-day requirement in Rule 4

24

supersedes the forthwith service requirement of the Suits

25

in Admiralty Act.

1

There are three basic reasons for this

z

conclusion.

3

is procedural, so it was invalidated by the Rules Enabling

4

Act when Rule 4 was amended in 1966 and 1982.

5

Number 1, the forthwith service requirement

Second, a holding that the forthwith requirement

6

prevails would violate and frustrate congressional intent

7

and the policies underlying the act and the Federal Rules

8

of Civil Procedure.

9

Finally, even if the forthwith service

10

requirement is not procedural, the 1982 amendments to the

11

Federal rules were done by direct legislative action, so

12

they would invalidate the forthwith requirement.

13

QUESTION:

Well, the Rule 4(j) as I read it,

14

Mr. Sheehy, simply says that if a complaint is not -- if

15

service is not made on a defendant within 120 days it

16

shall be dismissed.

17

120 days in which to serve a complaint.

18

MR. SHEEHY:

It doesn't say you invariably have

Mr. Chief Justice, I think that the

19

legislative history and the comments made by the advisory

20

committee, et al. indicate that the 120 rules, there is no

21

exception to it, and that in fact the parties have 120

22

days to serve - -

25

QUESTION:

Well, and to what extent are we -- do

we defer to legislative history in this area?
MR. SHEEHY:

Your Honor, because in 1982 this

-L

particular rule was reviewed to great extent by Congress,

2

as the Court is aware, the submission by the Court was not

3

adopted in total by the Congress, and there was a review

4

by the Congress and this very issue was discussed, namely,

5

under what provisions would the 120 days be put into the

6

rule.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SHEEHY:

9
10
11

It was discussed by whom?
There is a - - Professor Siegel in

his analysis of the rules, the advisory committee, and the
judicial conference.
The original submission by this Court to

12

Congress for the 120-day rule, the 120 days was there.

13

There was a suggestion by this Court about service by

14

mail, which eventually was changed, and there was also no

15

submission by this Court of a good cause extension.

16

What happened is, Congress, upon suggestions by

17

lawyers, particularly in California, concerned about the

18

certified mail provision and also about the fact that

19

there was an absolute 120-day shall-be-dismissed

20

provision, and the -- there were suggestions made that

21

were discussed by Professor Siegel --

22

23
24

QUESTION:

Well, how does that bear on how we

read a written rule?
MR. SHEEHY:

Well, my point exactly is that the

rule itself says, and I think the Government has conceded

1

in its brief on page 20 that there's a clear implication

2

that a party has 120 days to serve under Rule 4, that

3

there are no exceptions for it, it's not a guideline, it's

4

not a suggestion, but a party has 120 days, and I think --

5

QUESTION:

Well, but there certainly is room for

6

another statute, which we have here in the Suits in

7

Admiralty Act, to have a different requirement, and you

8

can read both statutes and give effect to both, that for a

9

suit in admiralty it has to be served forthwith, and if

10

it's not a suit under that act, then you might have a

11

longer time.
I mean, that is the argument the Government

12

13

makes, and it certainly is one that is plausible, isn't

14

it?
MR. SHEEHY:

15
16

With all respect, Your Honor, I

disagree.

17

Let us assume for a moment, just to make it a

18

little bit clearer, that instead of forthwith, the act

19

would have said 50 days, or a particular number, so it

20

becomes clear.

21

says the Government can be sued in 50 days in admiralty,

22

the Government in all cases can be sued in 120 days.

23

effect --

So in effect, we have one statute that

1

What it says is that if a service is

2

not made on a defendant within 120 days, it shall be

3

dismissed.

It doesn't say you invariably have 120 days.

4

MR. SHEEHY:

5

understand the Court's position.

6

legislative history of this, the discussions that were

7

going forward, indicate that there was an attempt to have

8

a bright line rule and to make uniform service in terms of

9

time upon all defendants.

a party has 120 days before the Court will dismiss the

case, and the way that I think that --

QUESTION:

I think the way that the statute

If we disagree with you on the

reading, then what are you going to argue?

19

MR. SHEEHY:

Well, if you find there is no

20

conflict, then the Rules Enabling Act probably does not

21

apply.

22

Now - QUESTION:

But then that would be a question of

23

first view for us, because the - - as I understand it, the

24

district court and the court of appeals threw it out

25

because they said it doesn't matter what Rule 4 means,

1

service must be made forthwith.

2

on your first point.

3

It's only if you're wrong

If Rule 4 takes over all service against the

4

United States, then we have an argument about what 4, Rule

5

4 means.

6

question before us is, is the admiralty statute, does it

7

survive Rule 4?

8

limit for serving the United States, or was Rule 4 meant

9

to cover all service on the United States?

10

But the first question, I thought the only

May there be more than one way, one time

Is there any other instance besides this

11

admiralty provision where there's an instruction for

12

serving the United States other than Rule 4?

13
14
15

MR. SHEEHY:

Your Honor, I am not aware of any.

I am not aware of any.
And my point in the enactment of Rule 4 and the

16

history of Rule 4, especially in the 1982 amendments, is

17

that because the marshalls were being taken out of the

18

process and prior to 1982 it was more or less a due

19

diligence standard under Rule 4, governed, of course, by

20

the parameters of the statute of limitations and also

21

motions to dismiss for want of prosecution, this issue

22

really did not arise very often.

23

In 1982, when the marshalls were taken out of

24

the process to a large extent, there was then a suggestion

25

that we have a time limit in order to make sure that there

1

was not undue delay, and I think that it is clear in the

2

discussions in the various committees that there was a

3

search for a bright line test and also a search for a time

4

that would take the discretion out of the hands of the

5

district court.
And, in fact, there was a discussion and a

6

7

comment by a Member of Congress, and it's cited in the

8

brief, having to do with the fact that we want to avoid

9

extended and protracted litigation over the ambiguity of

10

the time frames of Rule 4.
QUESTION:

11
12

But I've got a question about your

case that perhaps you can explain to me.

13

Could you not have said, we don't want to get

14

into this whole problem that time has run so long and

15

there have been snafus with the clerk's office, we're

16

still safe under the 2-year statute of limitations, we'll

17

just dump that first complaint, file a new complaint,

18

serve it forthwith, and we're still under the 2-year

19

limit.

20

Why wasn't -- could you have done that?

21

MR. SHEEHY:

I think the trial counsel probably

22

could have as a technical matter.

I suspect -- two

comments.

MR. SHEEHY:

QUESTION:

11

But you could have in August of '93.
Well, the statute of limitations -It hadn't run yet, had it?
Well, the statute of limitation

would have run August 27 of 1993, so therefore, it was --

7

10

Number 2

Right.
It was very close.
So on August 1 you could have done

this.
MR. SHEEHY:

Probably so.

Trial counsel I

12

suspect believed that he had 120 days in which to serve,

13

and therefore there was no need to dismiss and to refile.

14

But Your Honor is correct, and I think it's

15

available to most litigants in this situation, you can

16

dismiss and assuming that the statute of limitations

17

hasn't run, start all over again.

But the Attorney General had received notice by

mail pursuant to the statute back in May.

time, and again, I was not trial counsel, but I suspect

2

that what happened is, once the trial judge granted that

3

extension, there was no reason for counsel to believe that

4

he had to file the suit all over again.
QUESTION:

Well, it would have been safer if he

had.

MR. SHEEHY:

Certainly the duplicate effort

would have been safer.

There was something else about why

this was filed in Galveston rather than Houston.

that all - -

13

MR. SHEEHY:

What was

Your Honor, I don't think it's in

14

the record, but if I can make a couple of comments.

15

First, Galveston is the port city for Houston.

16

Galveston court generally handles, and are very

17

experienced in admiralty law.

18

The

The particular Federal judge there, Judge Kent,

19

was a lawyer who practiced admiralty in the trial court.

20

I don't think there is any prohibition between filing it

21

in Galveston versus filing it in Houston.

22

part of the Southern District of Texas.

23

with all respect to the judges in the Houston Division,

24

Judge Kent is extremely familiar with admiralty cases.

25

They are both
But certainly,

Secondly - - I hesitate to raise this in light of

1

the issue that we're here on, but also the docket is much

z

quicker in Galveston than it is in Houston, in large part

3

because of the criminal docket in Houston, in the Federal

4

courts there.
Thirdly, the operator of the vessel was Lykes

5
6

Brothers, and they are located or have an office in

7

Galveston.

8

9

And again, I did not make the decision, but
those are explanations as to why, and I think rational

10

reasons why, the case was filed in the Galveston Division

11

rather than the Houston Division, although I think as a

12

matter of law it really doesn't matter much, because they

13

are both part of the Southern District of Texas.

14
15

QUESTION:

we have held that the Federal rules supersede a statute?

16

MR. SHEEHY:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Are there cases from this Court where

Yes, Your -Or is this the first -- would this be

the first case?
MR. SHEEHY:

This is the first case of which I'm

20

aware that reaches this specific issue about where you

21

have a Federal statute dealing with service and the Rule 4

22

after the 1982 amendments.

23

certainly deals with the issue about whether Federal

24

statutes, Federal rules supersede State law in diversity

25

cases and I think, Justice Kennedy, certainly we can look

I think Hanna v. Plumer

12

i
2

to those cases for some guidance.
QUESTION:

But what about other rules, the

3

Federal rules of Appellate Procedure, Federal Rules of

4

Criminal Procedure, have any of those been deemed -- or

5

the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, because it contains

6

the supersession provision.

7

those rules to supersede a statute?

8

9

MR. SHEEHY:

Have we ever interpreted

Well, in the class action case, and

it was the American Pipe & Construction v. Utah where the

10

Court was interpreting Rule 23, having to do with class

11

actions, there was a question as to whether the class

12

certification process would toll the statute of

13

limitations of a Federal statute.

14

And in that case this Court held that, in fact,

15

the procedures and policies underlying Rule 23 were such

16

that the Court did have the authority to toll the statute

17

under Rule 23, the class action.

18

people who would be members of the putative class, would

19

have the right to sue dating back to the filing of the

20

original class certification action.

21

That is, that class,

So in that particular case, the Court held that

22

Rule 23 allowed that tolling even though the petitioner

23

had argued in that case that it should not because the

24

remedy and the statute of limitations were contained

25

within the same statute.

1

In addition, not exactly directly on point to

2

Your Honor's question, but in the Sibbach case there was a

3

question about Rule 35 having to do with physical

4

examinations, and there was an argument in that case that

5

the rule dealing with physical examinations was not

6

permissible because, in fact, it was such a fundamental

7

matter -- that is, the examination of the body -- and the

8

Court held that in fact it was a proper rule under the

9

Rule Enabling Act.

10

QUESTION:

I'll look again at American Pipe.

11

Did it say that the statute was superseded, or that the

12

rules would just be used to elaborate on the tolling

13

doctrine that's always available under a statute of

14

1imitations?

15
16

MR. SHEEHY:

Well, with all respect, it probably

held -- did not hold that there was a direct conflict.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SHEEHY:

Yes.
The Government -- I'm sorry, the

19

American Pipe had argued that, in fact, the statute

20

required one thing, and the rule could not be used to

21

circumvent that.

22

In truth, I think what happened was the Court

23

held that there is no direct conflict and, therefore,

24

Rule 23 could be used and the court was not bound by the

25

legislative intent in that case 'cos it was not clear,

1

because it was not clear.
To answer Your Honor directly, this particular

2

3

issue dealing with the forthwith requirement or a

4

requirement in a Federal statute and Rule 4 to my

5

knowledge has not been directly addressed by this Court,

6

and I think it is a result of several things.

7

Number 1, most of the Federal statutes do not

8

have this type of provision in them, and Number 2, that

9

Rule 4, since it was amended in 1982, has the 120-day rule

10

requirement.

11

The fundamental premise, and I agree it is --

12

QUESTION:

Counsel, may I go back to the

13

colloquy you were just having?

14

the contemplation of Congress that there could be laws

15

that would be displaced by the rules.

16

says.

17

all laws in conflict with the rules, or laws governing

18

procedure in conflict with the rules shall be of no

19

further force and effect once the rules take place, so it

20

was Congress saying, if there are any laws governing

21

procedure, those are displaced by the rules.

That's what 2072(b)

It says, the rules can't deal with substance, but

22

MR. SHEEHY:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. SHEEHY:

25

There is certainly within

Yes, Your Honor.
If there's a conflict.
Yes, and that was going to be my

next followup response to Justice Kennedy.

i

The reasons, I suspect, this has not come up is

2

because the Rule Enabling Act is clear in this area, that

3

if there is a conflict between a prior procedural statute

4

and a rule, the rule is going to prevail and, in this

5

particular case, it is our position that the forthwith

6

requirement is clearly procedural.

7

It has to do with the way that a party is

8

brought into litigation, and I am not aware of any

9

situation where a method or timing of service could be

10

considered anything other than procedural.
Once we get to that conclusion, that is, that

11

12

the rule is procedural, and we get to the conclusion that

13

there is a conflict, which I believe is clearly supported

14

by the legislative history and the committee reports

15

underlying the 1982 amendments to the Federal rules, then

16

it is our position that the Rule Enabling Act in effect

17

gives the priority to Rule 4.

18

QUESTION:

Well, may I ask, if we got that far,

19

and I don't know that we do, section 2072 of the Rules

20

Enabling Act refers to adoption of rules by the Supreme

21

Court.

22

so presumably subsection (b) doesn't apply here.

23
24
25

This was not a rule adopted by the Supreme Court,

MR. SHEEHY:

Your Honor, there are two ways we

can go at this.
First, our third point is that, in fact, this

MR. SHEEHY:

anyway, in the view of petitioner, it is clear that what

7

was intended in 1982 was to have a bright line test, and

there is no exception in Rule 4 for admiralty cases.

There is no indication of any type that Congress intended

to except admiralty cases from the provision of Rule 4.

Let's assume that we're dealing with two statutes.

This would be a repeal by implication.

MR. SHEEHY:

That's right.
I mean, that's the conclusion that

we're driving towards, and one way we reconcile

Don't you think that the

admiralty statute, or the statute dealing with suits

against the United States, covers a much more specific

situation than the general Rule 4?

13

MR. SHEEHY:

Yes, it does in terms of service,

enactment of Rule 4 and the 120-day service requirement

going to prevail, whereas if it's not a 2072(b) rule, and

we're going to treat it as a congressional statute, we'd

say that it wouldn't prevail, and that would be very odd

3

MR. SHEEHY:

But I think as a natural result of

the forthwith requirement there was a recognition that the

forthwith requirement gave rise to situations where the

6

cases were dismissed short of the merits because of an

7

uncertainty as to what forthwith meant, and there is a --

8

the second half of this is, there is a disagreement and a

9

misunderstanding as to the very definition of forthwith.

10

We have a disagreement between the Eleventh

11

Circuit and the Fifth Circuit as to exactly what it means,

12

and it's -- and so not only do we have an ambiguity in the

13

text itself of forthwith, or the meaning of forthwith, we

14

have an ambiguity as to how many days does it mean.

15

And I don't think there's any question that

16

because of that ambiguity and the lack of a bright line

test, there is a situation where lawyers representing

18

parties in admiralty do not know exactly if something has,

17

court's position I thought was, if the rule covers it, it

18

governs procedure in the Federal courts.

19

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think the question whether

20

a particular State rule should be incorporated into

21

Federal practice is a fundamentally different one from the

22

question of whether a Federal statute passed by Congress

23

specifically intended to regulate the filing -- the

24

service of complaints in the Federal courts should be of

25

no further force and effect.

It's a serious thing to reach the conclusion

that an act of Congress has been impliedly repealed, more

serious than to say that a State rule which is primarily

QUESTION:

Mr. --

QUESTION:

Is there -- there's another instance,

-- it's the question that I had asked counsel for the
petitioner.

I don't know of any other instance where

10

there's a separate instruction for how you serve United

11

States where the Rule 4 on service is not the instruction.

12

Is there another statute, other than this admiralty

MR. STEWART:

QUESTION:

No.

So it is one of a kind.
That's correct.

Mr. Stewart, do you know of any cases

19

in the district courts or the courts of appeals in which

20

the 120-day requirement has been read as you have read it,

21

as being merely an outer limit rather than as establishing

22

a right?

23

MR. STEWART:

Well, there -- I remember reading

24

one district court case in which the plaintiff raised both

25

title VII and State law claims, and the complaint was

served within 120 days, but the district court held that

2

it had not been served -- the plaintiff had not exercised

3

diligence in filing the suit as promptly as it could have

4

-- in serving the complaint as promptly as it could have

been filed, and held that the lack of diligence was

dispositive as to dismissal of the State law claim but not

as to the Federal law claim.

QUESTION:

Leaving a State law claim aside,

then, I take it your theory has never recommended itself
to any lower court.
MR. STEWART:

Well, the lower court simply

haven't passed on this question one way or the other.
QUESTION:

But why would it be?

I mean, if you

14

tell your children, if you don't make your room tidy by

So then they clean up their room,

conceivable reason could there be for the - - what reason

21

would there be when you have a set of rules which say at

22

the heading, statutes to the contrary, laws to the

23

contrary are to be wiped out, and you also have a specific

congressional statute here, don't we at least have to have

some reason, some theory why Congress would have wanted

]_

this to survive, and I can't think of one.
I mean, as far as my knowledge of this is

2

3

concerned, the reason that they had this forthwith at the

4

beginning was because at that time the marshalls served

5

after you filed the complaint, and so it was always

6

forthwith, and they didn't want that rule to govern

7

because it happened the particular admiralty rules

8

required you to arrest the defendant, and that wouldn't be

9

very happy when the U.S. was the defendant, and therefore

10

they wrote this word into a statute at a time when it made

11

sense.
Now it makes no sense, and so, unless it makes

12

13

some sense, why wouldn't we assume that Congress wanted

14

this new statute that they passed with uniform rules to

15

apply?

16

have had for not wanting to get rid of this now out-of-

17

date requirement?

18

So what sense is it, what reason could Congress

MR. STEWART:

Well, it was certainly the case in

19

1920, and I think it is still to some extent the case,

20

though not as greatly, that admiralty cases are different

21

in the sense that the witnesses are ordinarily likely to

22

be seamen, they may be transient, they may take off at a

23

moment's notice, it's a little bit more difficult to put

24

your case together after the fact, and Congress had that

25

evidence before it in 1920, and the question of whether

changes in the modern world have made that notion

2

superfluous is really one for Congress rather than for --

3

QUESTION:

Well, is there any indication that

4

their reason for passing this word forthwith was other

5

than what I said?

6

That is, is there any reason to think that their

7

reason for putting forthwith in the statute related to the

8

fact that sailors might leave port, as opposed to the fact

9

of what I'd said, that the normal practice was, the

10

marshall made the service, it always happened forthwith,

11

the admiralty rules which had the libelant make the

12

service didn't really seem to work because of the

13

arresting requirement, and therefore we'll write the rule

14

forthwith, because that's what always seems to happen.

15

That's one theory.

16
17

The other theory is the sailors are going to run
back to England or something.

18

MR. STEWART:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. STEWART:

Well --

What's your view of it?
Under the old rules, it did not

follow automatically upon service of a libel in personam

22

in admiralty, that the person would be arrested.

24

in the rule.

the consideration of the Suits in Admiralty Act that it

was particularly important to have admiralty suits

promptly disposed of because of the possibility of sailor

requirement was inserted earlier on, pursuant to a brief

colloquy between the proctor in admiralty and the

As to why it still might make sense, we do think

12

there is still a need on the part of the Government,

13

albeit a lessened need, to have service as promptly as

14

possible both in order to accumulate evidence and in order

15

to assess as accurately as possible the scope of its

16

contingent liability.

17

QUESTION:

I was going to ask you if the Justice

18

Department had ever recommended that Congress put the

courts out of their misery by repealing this statute.

your recommendation.

MR. STEWART:

Well, we would disagree with that.

2

First of all, the requirement that the complaint be served

3

forthwith is not buried in an obscure provision of the

code.

petitioner's trial counsel had to read in order to know

that he had a waiver of sovereign immunity.

It's in section 742, the same section that

I'm running into this technical problem.

So this is -- it's not a case about

Attorney.

21

MR. STEWART:

QUESTION:

23

That's correct.

When did the United States have

actual notice of this lawsuit?
MR. STEWART:

that the Government as a Government had notice, and that

2

was in May of 1993.

3

QUESTION:

So we're not talking about actual

4

notice to the U.S.

5

could have been cured by withdrawing one complaint and

6

filing another, no substantive difference, and yet the

7

United States is insisting that this is somehow under

8

subject matter jurisdiction.

9

We're talking about something that

MR. STEWART:

It really is very strange.

Well, again, part of your

10

question, in essence, goes to the wisdom of requiring

11

plaintiffs in suits against the United States to serve

12

both the United States and the Attorney General, and a

13

plausible argument could be made that service on the

14

Attorney General should be good enough.

15

The Congress that passed the Suits in Admiralty

17

rules require - -

QUESTION:

I wasn't questioning that.

MR. STEWART:

I mean, that is not the way it's

4

done even under -- where Federal Rule 4(j), or now 4(m),

5

is the only requirement.

6

That is, it may often be the case that a suit is

7

filed way before the statute of limitations is going to

8

expire, and the person may delay for more than 120 days

without good cause and may have his suit dismissed even

though he could have dismissed on his own and moved for

13

That's not an anomaly that's unique to

I think our basic point is that in the

In any particular --

that a private party wouldn't gain?

Why does it matter

whether these enormous number of suits first come to your

attention within 10 days or 120 days?

MR. STEWART:

I mean,

And I think -- I think perhaps the

6

stronger argument for making a different rule for the

7

United States would be that every potential maritime

8

defendant has this interest to some degree, but as to

9

suits against private parties, it may often be

10

impracticable to locate a defendant immediately.
QUESTION:

11

Yes, but of course, the United States

12

has the same interest in all the litigation against it.

13

It really doesn't differentiate the Federal tort claims.

14

Let me ask you another question that --

MR. STEWART:

16

QUESTION:

17

this one out first.

18

that you can say the requirement of -- the permission to

Second, we would say that application of that

Wouldn't it help you out of this

11

problem you have if you simply thought that later enacted

statutes of Congress which specifically say that they're

13

overturning laws to the contrary, or imply it because of

14

the rule, do overturn laws to the contrary, and unless

there is some good reason why this earlier law would be

MR. STEWART:

We have no problem with that

formulation.
QUESTION:

All right, and then the only -- the

20

reason that you've come up with for thinking that it is

21

meant to survive is because it had to deal in part with

22

the disappearing seamen witnesses, although that wasn't a

23

strong enough reason for the rules makers to deal

24

similarly with private people whom the SAA was designed to

25

treat the Government similarly to.

the later -- well, you see the point.
MR. STEWART:

I see your point, but in our view

7

the Suits in Admiralty Act requirement simply is not in

8

conflict with the Federal rule, and we have to presume

9

that Congress used that phrase for a reason.

That is,

10

Congress could have said in the Rules Enabling Act, all

11

laws governing procedure in the Federal courts or all laws

12

governing the subject matter covered by these rules shall

13

be of no further force and effect.

5

But Mr. Stewart, that was done before

6

there were Federal rules, and one can understand why there

7

are no other laws in conflict, because when the rulemakers

8

first came up with the Federal rules, the admiralty rules

were separate, so the civil rules saw that there was no

other way of serving the United States.

fluctuate greatly depending upon national emergencies or

3

need for transport generally, so it's not the case that

4

people employed by MarAd typically stay employed by MarAd

The one point we do want to stress is that to

7

say that these two provisions are in conflict, and to

8

state that as a general proposition, would, we think, have

9

highly disruptive effects on other areas of law, both in

10

terms of conflicts between Federal statutes and in terms

11

of Federal preemption of State law.
That is, if it were the case that whenever

12

13

Federal and State law generally govern the same subject

14

matter, and the Federal law prohibited -- permitted

15

something that the State law prohibited, the State law was

thereby preempted because the two were in conflict.

It seems to me that the two cases are very close.

requirement being in section 2 of the act.

The argument

9

is, is that procedure is in section 3, substance is in

3

section 2.

4

registered mail is, in fact, procedural, falls into

5

section 2 and therefore casts great doubt on the argument

6

that there should be a distinction based on the location

7

of the forthwith requirement in the statute.
Number 2, the point that Justice Souter was

9

The concession that the certified mail and

talking about, namely, a reason why the Government should

10

be treated differently in admiralty, something about

11

locating sailors, et cetera, three quick points.
Number

12

, no reason to treat the Government

3

differently than private parties in that context, because

4

all parties have that problem.

5

Number 2, there is no reason to treat the

Government differently in admiralty cases versus any other

cases that the Government may be involved in.

If there's going to be problems

we have a forthwith requirement, the statute of
