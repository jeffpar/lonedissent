ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. FLAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

✓

We'll hear argument

In Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence

12

Congress delegated to this Court the power to recognize

13

new evidentiary privileges consistent with the principles

14

of the common law as interpreted in the light of reason

15

and experience.

16

Even before Rule 501, when this Court had full

17

common law power to recognize privileges, the Court was

18

very parsimonious in the privileges that it would

19

recognize.

20

for trade secrets, a common law privilege for informants,

21

a common law privilege for military secrets.

22

rejected a news gatherer's privilege, and an accountant's

23

privilege.

The Court recognized a common law privilege

presented in the petition for certiorari.
I think the question here is that the agreed

12

question is whether there should be a Federal privilege

13

for this kind of evidence, and this kind of evidence that

14

we're focusing on is not confidential communications about

15

dreams or feelings.

16

QUESTION:

Well, is it different in kind from

17

the kind of evidence that would be privileged under the

18

clinical -- under a privilege for clinical psychologists?

Does the social worker here learn something different in

As a general rule, I think a legislature

could make a rational distinction between social workers
and clinical psychologists and psychiatrists.
QUESTION:

Because?

MR. FLAXMAN:

Because they'd be different kinds

of therapy.
QUESTION:

Well, what is the difference?

MR. FLAXMAN:

Well, I think as a rational

distinction a legislature, could say that a psychiatrist
and a clinical psychologist are going to be more concerned
with psychic reality, and a social worker would be more
concerned with helping somebody deal with their - - the
problems that they're facing.

I mean, that sounds very sensible

just based on the language we're using.

As a matter of

It's --

It sounds like a reasonable answer,

but is it true, I guess is what I'm saying.

That's correct.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Flaxman --

11

QUESTION:

The brief of the American Psychiatric

12

Association I take it, correct me if I'm wrong, supports

13

the Respondent here, and they don't ask that we draw the

14

line that you're suggesting in this colloquy with Justice

15

Souter.

MR. FLAXMAN:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. FLAXMAN:

That brief --

Or am I incorrect?
No, I think you're absolutely

19

correct, but I think they're incorrect in reading the

20

record in this case.

support the claim that there was psychoanalytic counseling

22

going on with the social worker and respondent Redmond.

The record in this case doesn't reflect anything about the

that formal psychiatric or psychoanalytic sessions are not

2

necessarily different in their objectives than clinical

3

counseling in the more ordinary sense, assuming there's an

4

aura of confidentiality about it, where the

5

confidentiality is expected on both sides.

6

MR. FLAXMAN:

No, I think, and I -- perhaps I'm

7

misreading their brief, but I think they make a

8

distinction between psychoanalysis and counseling.

9

Psychoanalysis is dealing with psychic truth.

Not with

10

what really happened, but with a person's feelings and

11

emotions and dreams about what happened, and about

12

someone's childhood.

13

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Flaxman, I take it you

14

would not extend in a Federal case a privilege to a

psychiatrist.

MR. FLAXMAN:

That's our primary position, is

that the confidential interest -- and we concede that
there are confidential interests in counseling and
therapy.
QUESTION:

And yet all 50 States recognize some

form of privilege in this area.
MR. FLAXMAN:

Well, some of the -- they

recognize some form of privilege.

Some of those

privileges amount to nothing more than the balancing test,
the district judge's, the trial judge's discretion that
we're seeking in this case, and the States have made
different exceptions, and many States -QUESTION:

Now, the court below didn't adopt a

clear rule of, there is a privilege and that's that.

It

went on to balance the need for the evidence?
MR. FLAXMAN:

Well, the court below adopted a

very unconventional definition of cumulative.

It said, I

think, that because there were four witnesses who were
family members of the deceased, and one police officer on
the other side in the civil rights case, our learning what
the police officer told the social worker, our learning
that the police officer had had memory problems, would be
cumulative.

In the area of privileged

communications, do the Federal courts typically engage in

1

a balancing in determining whether to apply the privilege

2

or not?
MR. FLAXMAN:

3
4

‘the Second Circuit has expressly adopted a balancing test,

5

and describes the privilege that it was adopting as

6

nothing more than a requirement that the district judge

7

balance the privacy interest with the opponent's need to

8

know.
QUESTION:

9

✓

The one circuit that has recog --

Well, that's really not much of a

10

privilege, is it, because if everything is going to be

11

balanced at the time the evidence is sought to be

12

admitted -- the time the privilege is supposed to work is

13

when the person either feels free or does not feel free to

14

confide to the professional therapist.
MR. FLAXMAN:

15

Well, we're not .seeking

16

disclosures about confidences about feelings or about

dreams.

That's -- the district judge said that's all we can get.

it's not always easy to separate those from an account of

the magistrate judge who supervised the deposition of the

was very clear that we could ask, what did you say about

the incident, and when we tried --

5

QUESTION:

It

Mr. Flaxman, correct me if I'm wrong

6

about this, but I thought that part of what you were

7

asking did involve mental impressions to the extent that

8

you were asking for the notes of the social worker.

9

MR. FLAXMAN:

The notes of the social worker

10

only came up after the respondent testified that she could

11

not recall any of her conversations with the social

12

worker.

13

QUESTION:

Are you now conceding that mental

14

impressions of the social worker, mental impressions

15

reflected in her notes, are things to which you do not

16

have access?

17

MR. FLAXMAN:

As a matter of relevancy, that's

18

correct, and the district judge said that we could not get

19

her notes when he was ruling on the relevancy qxiestion.

20

The district judge said we could get notes that relate to

21

conversations about the incident.

QUESTION:

It was after --

But the conversations, the notes, mix

in, as lawyer's notes do, the social worker's own mental

impressions with things that the patient or client said

about what happened.

I thought you were saying, we want

11

MR. FLAXMAN:

We objected to that.

contents of conversations with the social worker.

20

After hearing and observing the character and

demeanor of the witness, the district judge said, these

22

denials, these I don't recalls are wholly incredible, and

the only way to refresh her recollection is to review all

QUESTION:

3

It was sanctioned for this meeting.
The propriety of that particular

4

resolution I'm not sure is before us, or that the Court is

interested in, but it seems to me very odd.

6

for you to ask a witness, have you talked to your

7

attorney, and the unprepared witnesses will say, oh, no.

It's standard

Well, everybody knows that that's incredible,

8

but if the witness responds in that incredible way, that
10

isn't an open door to then inquire about all the

11

conversations with the attorney.

MR. FLAXMAN:

13

That's correct.

helping somebody change their recollections of an
incident, to going into therapy.
QUESTION:

Mr. Flaxman --

QUESTION:

You say an attorney isn't always

interested in changing someone's recollections of an
incident?
(Laughter.)
MR. FLAXMAN:

An attorney should not be helping

somebody change their recollections and commit perjury,
and if an attorney does that, then the attorney is subject
to sanctions.
If a therapist does that, and helps somebody
sleep at night after they aid a horrible thing, then the
therapist has:.succeeded.
The goals of therapy are quite different than
the goals of an attorney.

An attorney is ultimately

answerable to the court as an officer -QUESTION:

Mr. Flaxman, you said earlier that

the privilege recognized by some States, which amounts to
a balancing of the importance of the information versus

I mean, it's different from the rule

MR. FLAXMAN:

It's an absolute privilege.
No.

Well, I think all of the

that someone is dangerous, or that there's a child abuse

admission.

10

There are no absolute privileges in

psychotherapy in any State in this - -

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. FLAXMAN:

And that includes Alaska and Arizona?
That's correct.

There are always

13

instances where a therapist has to -- is required by law

14

to make disclosures, and so there can't be this guarantee

15

of absolute privilege which the American Psychiatric-

16

Association would urge and would seek.

In enacting Rule 501, Congress declared that the

Federal courts are to look to reason and experience in

11

determining evidentiary privileges.

12

rule as evidenced both in the legislative history and as

13

acknowledged by this Court in the Trammel decision was not

to freeze the law of privilege as it existed but to allow

again in line with reason and experience.

The intent behind the

Now, it is true, as Mr. Flaxman has mentioned,

18

that decisions of this Court have counseled caution in

19

terms of the recognition of privilege.

20

Court has also stated that when a privilege promotes

21

sufficiently important interests to outweigh the need for

22

probative evidence, recognition and implementation of a

privilege is proper.

MR. FELDMAN:

I wanted to get to the second

point, which was that in our brief we suggest that the key

question is whether a confidential relationship is formed,

10

and that question, since States are the primary level of

11

government that governs the relationships of

psychotherapists and patients, as with most other

professions, the question of whether a confidential

MR. FELDMAN:

MR. FELDMAN:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

It would --no more --

Okay.

But the reason I -- let me

tell you why I ask the question.

7

Part of the premise of your argument is, the

8

value of recognizing the privilege depends upon the value

9

of the confidentiality in the relationship.
Now, we can't tell what the value of the

10
11

confidentiality in the relationship is unless we go State-

12

by-State and find out which States have strong privileges,

13

which States have just weak privileges.

14

And so I guess what we would have to do is to

J . «.

say, well.,

16

privileges, that would probably justify our recognition of

17

the strong privilege, but if a majority of the States have

18

a weak privilege, it wouldn't do any good for us, at least

19

in those States, to recognize a strong privilege because

20

it would have no effect on the relationship.

worker would have to say, I can't guarantee much.

Is that what we should do, is sort of do a nose

count and find out whether we're going to get much for our

privilege or a little for our privilege?

I think not quite.

What the
