ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY B. GUTMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

MR. GUTMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is a copyright infringement case.

It was

brought and tried under that statute and none other.
It is our position and the issue before the

14

Court that the First Circuit committed error here when it

15

held that section 102(b) of the Copyright Act precludes,

16

as a matter of law, protecting the separable original

17

expression contained in the menus of Lotus 1-2-3.

18

holding was not based upon the finding of fact that there

19

was any merger in this instance of the expression in those

20

menus with any idea or process or method.

21

This

Judge Keeton in the district court made fact

22

findings exactly to the contrary after trial and the First

23

Circuit said -- and this is in the petition appendix at

24

2la -- that it was accepting that fact finding as correct.

25

And clearly there's no finding that any of it was clearly

erroneous, so there's no First Circuit -QUESTION:

And that fact finding found some

protectable expression I take it.
MR. GUTMAN:

4

Protectable expression and a lack

5

of merger, Your Honor, and originality.

6

Keeton conducted t:he trial on all of the elements under

7

102(a) as set out in Feist, and on each of those grounds,

8

our menus passed muster.

9

did not reject any of that fact finding as clearly

10
11

Frankly, Judge

The judge -- the First Circuit

erroneous.
Rather, the First Circuit reached its conclusion

12

by failing to apply or by applying incorrectly the

13

idea/expression dichotomy.

14

ground for a reversal on remand, without reaching any of

15

the other issues that have been briefed in this case.

16

QUESTION:

This error is alone sufficient

I thought the First Circuit also

17

found it was a method of operation and therefore not

18

patentable.

What they found was that because it provides the

means - - these menus provide the means by which users

5

control and operate Lotus 1-2-3, it is therefore part of a

6

method of operation.

7

the First Circuit made no effort to determine whether

8

there was expression that could be distinguished or

9

separated from the method of operation.

10

The error -- the error -- was that

That's the

fundamental error here.
This Court taught in Feist that the

idea/expression dichotomy applies in every case and that

it is not an option.

And isn't the problem that the First Circuit had

problem, but a problem of saying that something which is

MR. GUTMAN:

Respectfully, I would disagree,

12

Justice Souter.

13

Copyright rarely provides black and white answers or

14

bright lines.

15

It's -- it is an analysis case.

The issue in each of these cases - - and this is

16

the heart of the idea/expression dichotomy -- is to look

17

at the works and determine whether the portions that are

18

at issue are portions that cannot be -- to which the

19

protection may not extend, in the words of 102(b), because

20

they are a system, a method, et cetera.

21

What we are talking about in this instance is

22

words, whose only function and purpose is to inform the

23

user as to what functionality is available in the program

and how to access it, that is, which keystrokes to use in

1

Well, part of what troubles people I

suppose is that if you have a little menu command and all

it says is exit, block, move, et cetera, maybe those are

What is it about the Lotus program that

This was the subject of the trial

in the district court, Your Honor, and Judge Keeton was

mindful of the Court's decision in Feist.

We have an

10

unlike Feist where one took a given set of names and

11

simply alphabetized them which did not have that minimum

spark of creativity that the Copyright Act requires.

In this instance, the creators of Lotus 1-2-3

beyond having made the decisions as to what functions the

15

program should perform, all of which Judge Keeton clearly

16

provided was not protected.

was part of the unprotected idea, and we did not seek to

get him to rule otherwise on that subject.

19

the program performs are not protected.

The functionality, he said,

The functions

20

Even taking that as a given, what Judge Keeton

21

found was that the creators of 1-2-3 had a vast array of

22

choices in terms of how they would present that

23

functionality to the user and that's where the expression

24

is.

But at a certain level it seems to me

that the expression necessarily merges with the function

MR. GUTMAN:

6

There's no question, Justice

7

Kennedy, that there are certain menus and certain user

8

interfaces that would be far too simple to pass the Feist

I'm not quite sure what it is that you say

MR. GUTMAN:

14

But it's more than creativity, sweat

Well, if I may use the inelegant

15

analogy of sweat, I believe that what the Feist case

16

established is that not all sweat has equal impact under

17

copyright law.

18

That's clear after Feist.

sweat, expressive’sweat, spending months, as the authors

20

of 1-2-3 did, considering dozens and dozens and dozens of

21

different iterations of a menu structure and of precise

22

words to use and their placement to find what you think is

23

the best way of presenting it is precisely the kind of

24

creative activity which I think does pass muster under

Feist.

It's the work of the author,

This is not a close case under

Two, because there is not a merger of the idea

15

or functions of the program and the expression in these

16

particular menus.

17

Now, the way Judge Keeton made that judgment was

18

based on a factual record before him which included dozens

19

of different spreadsheet programs, all of which provided

20

fundamentally the same functionality, but which had very

21

different menus.

22

Indeed, the single -- if one had to rely on only

a single bit of evidence to refute merger here, I would

rely on the infringing work itself, Borland's program

QUESTION:

So,

Mr. Gutman, may I ask you one thing

that I think was very much on Judge Boudin's mind?

6

You have just explained that (b) doesn't exempt

7

wholesale anything you could call a method of operation.

8

Sure, it's a method of operation but it has expression,

9

and you have to separate the expression out just like you

10

do with an idea, with a procedure, anything else.

11

all binary in that respect.

12

They're

But Judge Boudin said the user has put in a lot

13

of the user's own sweat orwhatever

to develop something

14

new, and that something is

15

macros.

17

--to customize a whole set of things for the user's own

work, unless the user can resort to the Lotus commands.

in theform

of allthese

And those macros were not created by Lotus 1-2-

It was the user, working with this machine, to get up

The user can't extract that, the user's own

20

So, I noticed something in your reply brief.

21

You said, of course, for the user this would be a fair

22

use.

23

can one look at this and say what Borland is doing is

24

facilitating the user's fair use?

25

There would be no infringement for the user.

MR. GUTMAN:

So,

Well, I think, Your Honor, that the

1

user and Borland stand in very different positions for

2

fair use purposes.

3

example, if a user wanted to convert a 1-2-3 macro so that

4

it would work in Quattro Pro and the conversion was

5

required, there is much that that user could do for his or

6

her own personal purposes that I think would fairly easily

7

qualify as a fair use.

8

What the user does in terms -- for

When a competitor makes a wholesale

9

appropriation of your entire menu structure, which is the

10

communicative core of the user interface of the program -

11
12

QUESTION:

But that's my question.

Is - - can

13

the user - - how can the user with all these macros make

14

use of them with the Borland spreadsheet?

15

MR. GUTMAN:

Well, that brings me - - the user

16

can rewrite the macro or convert it as necessary even if

17

3orland had done none of what it did in infringement.

18

But that does bring me naturally to the second

19

point I wanted to make, which is because the First Circuit

20

dealt the way it did with copyrightability, it never

21

reached the next step which is infringement.

22

And there were two separate active infringements

23

here on the part of Borland.

One was copying the words on

24

the screen, the menus themselves.

25

mid-litigation development and the subject of our

1

supplemental complaint, was this macro key reader, which

2

was an internal translator.
Now, there may very well be different issues.

3
4

There are different issues in terms of infringement

5

between those two different acts of infringement, and the

6

First Circuit never reached any of those.

7

QUESTION:

May I ask you something about the key

8

reader?

9

providing the key-reader wouldn't be enough because all

10

you could do with the key reader was run your macros as

11

is, that in order to modify them, you would have to have

12

access to all the commands.

13

Do I - - one of the briefs suggested that just

MR. GUTMAN:

Or to fix them.

And if -- what

14

that point makes, which was made by a number of the amici,

15

Your Honor -- what that illustrates is exactly our point,

16

that the purpose of the menus is to inform.

17

reason they would want the words -- if someone -- let me

18

back up a step.

19

The only

If someone wanted, having already purchased

20

Quattro Pro and being a Quattro Pro user now, not only to

21

convert a 1-2-3 macro so that it could be used in Quattro

22

Pro, but to keep writing it as a 1-2-3 macro, which

23

wouldn't make sense once you've switched -- even if

24

someone wanted to do that, what the argument of the amici

25

is is that, well, you'd still need to look at those words

1

of the menu in order to understand what you were doing.
And the response to that is, if so, it is only

2

3

because the function of those words is to inform.

4

could get the samq information out of a piece of paper or

5

a 1-2-3 users manual which, as a former 1-2-3 user, you

6

pres umab1y have.

QUESTION:

Mr. Gutman, a moment ago you said

8

something about a finding of infringement.

9

over your question presented.

10

You

I just read

I don't see that it

presents anything about any question of infringement.
MR. GUTMAN:

11

That's exactly the point.

That's

12

exactly the point, Mr. Chief Justice.

The infringement

13

issue, which is where these two different points come up

14

is not before the Court and wasn't addressed by the First

15

Circuit.
«

16

So, my point is if I am correct, if our position

17

is correct, that the First Circuit made a - - an error in

18

interpreting 102(a) and its relationship to 102(b) and

19

there's a reversal on remand, the First Circuit can then

20

deal with the infringement issues, at which point it may

21

or may not decide that the key reader is different from

22

the menus.

23

I mean, we understand and recognize that the

24

protection on the key reader, that the issues are

25

different and that the arguments are not as strong there

1

because the expressive content is not as strong.

2

is not an issue that this Court has before it because, as

3

the Chief Justice just pointed out, the issue raised in

4

the petition and the only issue dealt with by the First

5

Circuit, and thus before the Court, is the issue of

6

copyrightability and this fundamental issue of the

7

relationship between the two pieces of 102.
UESTION:

8

But that

But assuming -- I assume the 469

words are in English and they each express something, but
10

I take it that the genius of what Lotus did was to work

11

out ways of organizing and presenting in a certain order

12

possible functions of a computer, possible functions of

13

certain programs.

14

edit, and that's a lot of work.

15
16

they worked out, does it?
MR. GUTMAN:

18

20

They did that.

Copyright doesn't protect the ingenious system

Let's put file first and follow it with

UESTION:

Well -That's the last thing copyright has

in mind.
MR. GUTMAN:
UESTION:

Well -And if that's so, the question then

22

comes down to whether one can easily or reasonably easily

23

use their system, unless something else protects it,

24

without using their words.

general that kind of an issue.
MR. GUTMAN:

3
4

I'm trying to get you to discuss in

Certainly.

I would not agree that

the words are the system, Your Honor.
QUE TION:

5

No, no.

The system is calling up

6

certain kinds of commands in a certain order.

7

use a different word.

You could

You don't have to say file, but

it's the most natural word to use or it is a natural word
9

to use.

I don't want to get into an argument about that.
What I'm trying to work out is - - the analogy

10
11

that I've been using, which no one likes, is I could

12

invent a system for organizing a department store:

13

floor, women's; second floor, men's; third floor, boys.

14

Within the department store, floors, pants here, trousers

15

there, shirts there.

16

et cetera.

17

The genius is in my system, not the words on the sign, and

18

you have the right under the copyright law to tie up the

19

system by copyrighting the words gentlemen, ladies, and

20

saying, oh, you could use Caballeros, you could use damas,

21

you could use monsieur.

Within the shirts, dress, not dress,

And I could have little signs over each one.

MR. GUTMAN:

I mean, you see?
I understand the point of the

23

question, but in this case it's not correct.

Borland's own product -- again, this is -- Borland's own

product is a refutation of the point because they did

I mean, the genius of this was

not just that you could -- you had a system of access.

was which words came first, what order they're presented

Is that what Borland was able to do?
MR. GUTMAN:

Borland provided exactly -- exactly

-- the same functions.

MR. GUTMAN:

By - - well, the answer, Your Honor,

would be that they would do it the way everybody else who

them succeeded, some of them failed.

QUESTION:

But is it the purpose of copyright

law to throw up that kind of obstacle to the use not of

24

some expressions, but to the use of a person who invented

MR. GUTMAN:

I understand the worry, Your

Honor, and where we have a different perspective is that

we don't believe we are trying to protect the system.

QUESTION:

We

In order to refute that point, do the

12

wrong because the function has merged with the expression.

13

Is that the only way they can win?

available under the copyright law.

QUESTION:

2

Let me ask you an entirely different

kind of question, and it goes to this point of whether it

is indeed possible to draw the line that the First Circuit

drew between program and menu.
The respondents pointed to evidence that that is

6

7

what Congress intended to do, and they did this at page -

8

- I wrote it down -- page 37 of their brief by referring

9

to the CONTU report and said that the CONTU report

10

apparently expressly referred to the copyrightability of a

11

source code, an object code, and possibly the flow chart,

12

and that's where it stopped so that it would be reasonable

13

to read the 1980 amendments as expressing Congress'

judgment that this material would be copyrightable and

that anything beyond that need not be.

MR. GUTMAN:

It's not, Your Honor, because CONTU

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY L. REBACK

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

6

7

MR. REBACK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court: .

8

Pursuant to the patent and the copyright clause

9

of the Constitution, Congress enacted two regimes for the

10

granting of private monopolies.

11

regime, the grant of private monopoly is done in a wholly

12

indiscriminate, uncritical, unexamined way, and under the

13

other regime, the regime of patents, grants of private

14

monopoly are made following an exacting examination and

15

the satisfaction of very high thresholds.

16

One regime -- under one

Now, as Judge Boudin explained below, because of

17

the way Congress set up the first regime, the regime of

18

copyright, it's used for subject matter where the damage

19

to society by a mistake in grant of protection is not all

20

that great, where the problem of overprotection is not

21

something that we should really worry about because even

22

if we mistakenly grant protection, the next author can

23

always make a near substitute.

24

QUESTION:

25

Is there any reason to think that

Congress was of this view that was expressed by Judge

1

Boudin?
MR. REBACK:

2

3

Yes, I think so, Your Honor.

I

think so for several reasons.

4

The first is that 102(a) of the statute -- the

5

statute formerly read in 1909, all the writings of an

6

author.

7

the language was changed to make it clear that not all

8

writings are copyrightable, but rather that there is a

9

separate ambit for things that we don't worry about

And that created confusion in the case law, and

10

overprotection and a regime of patents in which we do

11

worry about that.

12

That's the language that is expressly intended to keep

13

copyright from undermining the patent system.

That's most directly set out in 102(b).
«

14

QUESTION:

Well, it shows a narrowing certainly,

15

but I would not think just the one citation you make means

16

that Congress adopted the view the Judge Boudin expressed.

17
18

MR. REBACK:

Well, Judge Boudin had a variety of

things to say in his opinion.

19

But the point that 102(b) is intended to prevent

20

overcompensation to the first author I think comes through

21

from the language of the statute itself.

22

doesn't read the idea of a system is uncopyrightable.

23

If we apply that, 102(b), to the Baker v. Selden

2

situation, Selden may have had a terrific system, but

3

people had no way to use that system, or at least to use

4

it efficiently, until he put some textual labels on it.

5

The same is true of Lotus' system.

6

can use systems is through some kind of textual label, and

7

the teaching of Baker v. Selden to us is that the bare set

8

of words, through which people use or manipulate or

9

operate a system, that's on the uncopyrightable side of

10

The only way people

the line.
That's what 102(b) does.

11

It prevents the

12

copyright law from undermining the ambit where we care

13

about overprotection, where a mistake in grant of

14

overprotection would do real damage to society because

15

there's not adequacy of near substitutes.

to express this?

MR. REBACK:

Not in this case.

I read --we

read the statute as saying that with respect to the things

in 102(b), Congress has decided that the protection of

those things through the regime of indiscriminate grants

with respect to the things in 102(b) that there is such a

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GUTMAN:

9

Thank you.

Mr. Reback conceded that a musical score or a

10
11

choreography would be protected by copyright even though

12

the score instructs the player in how to play his or her

13

instrument, even though the choreography instructs the

14

dancer in where to move his or her feet and body, and even

15

though they can be memorized like the keystrokes of Lotus

MR. GUTMAN:

The music exists even if there's no score.

The music is not a work of commercial

MR. GUTMAN:

Does your case depend on that,

protection to commercially useful works.
