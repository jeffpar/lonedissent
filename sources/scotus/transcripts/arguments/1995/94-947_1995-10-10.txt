ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
For almost 30 years, the National Labor

11

Relations Board consistently and repeatedly has held that

12

a person who applies for or holds a job with an employer

13

that he intends to try to organize, and who will be

14

compensated by a union for his organizational activity, is

15

an employee within the meaning of section 2(3) of the

16

National Labor Relations Act.

17

That section is set forth on page 2 of our

18

brief, and was last interpreted and applied by this Court

19

in its 1984 decision in Sure-Tan Incorporated against the

20

NLRB, and we are content to use the words of this Court in

21

Sure-Tan in describing this provision, and I'm quoting now

22

from page 891 of Volume 467 U.S., the breadth of section

23

2(3)'s definition is striking.

24

to 'any employee'.

25

the act squarely implies

The only limitations are specific exemptions for

agricultural laborers, domestic workers, individuals

2

employed by their spouses or parents, individuals employed

3

as independent contractors or supervisors, and individuals

4

employed by a person who is not an employer under the

5

National Labor Relations Act.

6

The Court then concluded that undocumented

7

aliens are not among the few groups of workers expressly

8

exempted by Congress, and they therefore plainly come

9

within the broad statutory definition.

10

QUESTION:

Is it your position, Mr. Wallace,

11

that if a person does not come within any of those

12

exemptions and is "hired" he is therefore an employee?

13
14

MR. WALLACE:

Well, that is the conclusion that

the Court reached, and it is our --

15

QUESTION:

I asked what your position --

16

MR. WALLACE:

Our position is that he is

17

therefore an employee unless there are reasons, in

18

interpreting the National Labor Relations Act, why an

19

implied exemption should be found, a question for the

20

board to address initially, and the only example in which

21

this Court found an implied exemption was the case of NLRB

22

v. Bell Aerospace which involved managerial employees, and

23

the Court in reliance upon the legislative history of the

24

Taft-Hartley Act and its overruling of this Court's

25

decision in the Packard case by adding to this list of

exemptions supervisors has -- that Congress had relied on

2

the notion that managerial employees would be excluded

3

sort of a fortiori from supervisors, and that the board

4

had always, while not holding them not to be employees,

5

had always placed them in separate bargaining units from

6

other employees.

What the board has --

So he -- that person is an employee.
That doesn't mean that he has to

be hired.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose he -- the company, not

knowing this, goes ahead and hires him.
MR. WALLACE:

Then he's subject to all of the

24

company's work rules and duties of loyalty.

25

the company hires him, he's even more so an employee.

Of course if
The

Court resolved in the 1941 decision in Phelps Dodge that

applicants are within the statutory coverage because

MR. WALLACE:

But isn't that a --- protects applicants from

QUESTION:

Isn't that Exhibit A, what I'm

talking about, of inconsistent loyalties?

he intends to blow the place up that night.

He'll perform the work for a day, but then

MR. WALLACE:

This is -- of course it would be a

13

breach of duty, whether it would be because he wanted to

14

do it of his own volition or whether because of loyalty to

15

some other group.

16

It would be a breach of duty.

What the board -- the board has pointed the way

17

to the proper analysis of these issues in the companion

18

case of this very case.

19

together, this case and Sunland Construction Company,

20

which is cited in all of the briefs, and there the board

21

held, after writing an opinion identical to the opinion in

22

this one until the last few paragraphs -- reaching the

23

conclusion that applications of this kind are employees

24

within the meaning of the act, the board held that

25

nonetheless it would not be a violation, an unjustified

discrimination under 8(a)(1) or 8(a)(3) for an employer to

2

refuse to hire a paid union organizer in the discrete

3

context of an ongoing strike situation in which the paid

4

union organizer would have a duty to support the work

5

stoppage in an attempt to coerce the employer, a

6

legitimate attempt under the law to coerce the employer to

7

accede to the union's demands.

And the employer would have an equally
legitimate right to want to hire replacement workers who

10

might be nonunion members, might be outside the bargaining

unit, might be outside strike-breakers --

QUESTION:

-- of other kinds to try --

Mr. Wallace --- to carry on their operations.

-- why wouldn't the same reasoning

17

that you've just explained to us for the strike exception

18

apply to the person who is under an agreement with the

19

union to walk out when the union blows the whistle?

20

isn't there that same inconsistency?

21

MR. WALLACE:

Why

Because while that is a rule of

22

the voluntary organization, section 7 of the act protects

23

the right of workers to have voluntary organizations,

24

including their right to make reasonable rules of conduct

25

for their members, but you're talking about a future

contingency, and when the time comes, under this Court's
decision in Pattern Makers and the rationale of this
decision, each individual can decide for himself whether
he will in fact adhere to the union rule -QUESTION:

But that's different, Mr. Wallace.

Different -- the worker can decide for himself.

The

worker who is under an agreement that the worker will walk
when told to by a third party -- let's say the third party
were not the union, but a competitor.

The applicant has

an agreement with the competitor that he will, if he gets
this job he'll stay on it till the competitor says, walk
out.

Can such a person qualify as an employee when, going

in, he has that agreement with a competitor?
MR. WALLACE:

He would definitely qualify as an

employee, although the rationale of Sunland might apply.
This is not an uncommon hypothetical.

There can

be employees who have been suspended from their job who
have an agreement with the employer that they will return
when recalled and retain their seniority and retain their
advanced pay scale status, so they have an economic
incentive to return to this competing employer.

In the

meantime, they've been laid off, they need a job, they go
to another competitor, and take the job.
They're -- of course they're an employee.
They're covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act.

8

Tell me --

MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

10

That has always

-- that the board looks to.

-- what you're saying about someone

11

who has an inconsistent obligation, whether that coincides

12

with the approach that Judge Williams took in the Willmar

13

case, or is it different?

14

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I think the board's approach

15

and the approach that Judge Williams took on behalf of the

16

D.C. Circuit in the Willmar case are substantially

17

identical.

18

but in Willmar, the D.C. Circuit said that yes, these are

1

employees, and we leave for another day whether the

20

employer would be justified in treating them differently

21

under 8(a)(1) or 8(a)(3), in other words in not hiring

22

them.

23

There may be some differences in articulation,

It was shortly thereafter that the board decided

24

Town & Country and Sunland, and it reached opposite

25

conclusions on the question left for another day,

1

depending on whether there was an ongoing strike or not,

2

because the board did not regard it as an irreconcilable

3

conflict of interest under the National Labor Relations

4

Act for an employee to have a loyalty to his union and to

5

the voluntary right of self-organization and to the

6

employer.

7

That's what the -QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, did the board rule

8

expressly on the provision of the salting resolution that

9

the employee would walk when told to by the union?

I

10

wasn't aware that the board had ruled specifically on

11

that, as distinguished from being paid by the union.
MR. WALLACE:

12

The focus before the board was on

13

the compensation question.

14

that relied more strongly and responded, and their amici

15

are relying more strongly on the salting resolution

16

itself.

17

It was the court of appeals

So the board did not address a contention

18

specifically based on the salting resolution, but it did

19

discuss the question of control, which is what that

20

argument is based on, and pointed out that any paid union

21

organizer, as the board calls anyone getting any form of

22

compensation from the union with a duty to organize, would

23

still be subject to the employer's direction and control,

24

to his work rules, to the obligations to perform his

25

duties in an acceptable manner for the employer and,

1

indeed, what the board found is that someone in this

2

situation has an added incentive not to perform in a

3

substandard manner or to do any act that would warrant

4

discharge, because that would defeat his opportunity to be

5

on the premises and to engage in his organizing campaign

6

during off-work hours.

7

So far from finding any conflicting duties --

8

because after all he's subject to the same rules of no

9

solicitation during work time or in work areas.

at lunch break or after work is over.

MR. WALLACE:

15

It's done

You don't really

Mr. Wallace --- in the classic sense for two

different masters under the Restatement.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, can an employer

16

legitimately adopt a hiring policy to the effect that we

17

will not hire anyone who moonlights for another employer,

18

or who has another job, including a job for the union,

19

it's just our policy not to hire people who do have, or

20

may have a second job?

21

MR. WALLACE:

So long as it's a neutral policy

22

that is not directed at antiunion animus.

23

a particular factual setting a pretext for the denial of

24

rights under the act.

1

be such an employer policy, and it could include even

2

employment by the union, as in this context.

3

Absolutely.

Any neutral across-

4

the-board policy requiring a commitment to work for a

5

certain duration of time, asking whether there are

6

obligations to any third party that might interfere with

7

future duties in any way, certainly asking whether there

8

was an obligation to anyone --

9

I

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

Would you say this -- this would be

10

answered no, that last question.

11

question, put to a union organizer, would be answered no,

12

whether there's any conflicting obligation to someone else

13

that would interfere with duties in any way.

14

MR. WALLACE:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

You say that that

Well, I --

You say the union organizer can stand

up and say no.
MR. WALLACE:

Well, that depends on what the

18

neutral policy of the employer is.

19

that they want everyone to swear that they have no

20

obligation to --

21

QUESTION:

If the employer says

Well, no, I'm just talking about the

22

question that you put.

You said that the employer may ask

23

applicants whether he has any commitment to a third party

24

that would interfere with duties in any way, and as I

25

understand your presentation to us, you think that the

1

union organizer can answer that question honestly, no.
MR. WALLACE:

2

That is true in the context of

3

this case, where you have employment at will, where either

4

the employer or the employee has a right to leave at any

5

time.

That's the only possible -QUESTION:

6

Now, what if it were a term contract.

7

I mean -- but that -- would people who are -- sure.

8

- suppose it's a term contract for 3 years, and he has the

9

same arrangement with the union that he'll quit when the

10

You -

union tells him to.
MR. WALLACE:

11

The employer could definitely ask

12

whether there are any conflicting obligations that would

13

result in premature departure and failure to observe the

14

term.

15

QUESTION:

But suppose he doesn't ask?

Would

16

that, the existence of that conflict not be a sufficient

17

reason for dismissal?

That's not this case --

1

different, though, because there his obligation to the

2

union might indeed require him to break a duty, a

3

commitment to the employer.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace,

it would be different in

5

terms of whether the employer has a right to discharge

6

him, but would it be different with respect to the

7

question of whether he was nevertheless an employee during

8

the period of the service.

9

MR. WALLACE:

Precisely what I was about to say.

10

He would still be an employee as an applicant for the job,

11

but it would raise the Sunland question.

12

The Sunland contention that this was justified

13

discrimination was never raised before the board in this

14

case, and it would have been hard to raise it in this case

15

because at the time the adverse action was taken, the

16

employer here did not know of the salting resolution, did

17

not know of the union compensation.

18

QUESTION:

I'm not sure, Mr. Wallace, that I

19

fully understand your example, or your statement, or your

20

concession that an employer with a neutral purpose,

21

say, can ask, do you have any conflicting obligations to

22

any other employer or organization?

let's

23

Now, suppose the answer to that is yes,

24

member of the union, and I'll strike if they tell me to do

25

that.

I suppose he's mandatorily entitled to employment.

MR. WALLACE:

obligation, because the union --

3

QUESTION:

That is not a conflicting

Well, suppose an employer interprets

4

it that way.

It isn't because of the labor laws, the

5

National Labor Relations Act.

6

MR. WALLACE:

7

QUESTION:

That is correct, and --

So I think you have to amend your

8

statement to say that if the reason for an affirmative

9

answer to the question, do you have a conflicting

10

obligation, is a primary loyalty to the union that that is

11

a supervening reason that entitles the employee to be

12

hired, I should think.

13

MR. WALLACE:

That is a question for the board,

14

and it reached the opposite conclusion in Sunland

15

Construction, which is the only case in which it has

16

reached the opposite conclusion in the discrete context of

17

an ongoing strike.

18

QUESTION:

Oh, that would be an ongoing strike.

19

MR. WALLACE:

20

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, so —

Surely you don't mean that union

21

membership, which imposes certain duties which can be

22

enforced, I take it, by a cause of action for damages, et

23

cetera, is grounds for nonemployment?

24
25

MR. WALLACE:

I would not anticipate that the

board would readily expand Sunland Construction.

QUESTION:

1

Well, I would not anticipate the

2

board could do that consistently with the National Labor

3

Relations Act.

4

MR. WALLACE:

Well, of course, that question

5

would be subject to judicial review if the board attempted

6

to do it.

7

What I'm trying to point out is that that is the

8

proper analytical approach to questions of whether refusal

9

the employer did not know of the salting resolution or the

This is a way to get around the McKennon v.

You just say, well, they're outlaws ab initio, now that we

employee definition here doesn't involve that, and United

still alive, and I don't know why it wouldn't be in

MR. WALLACE:

We argue that deference is

10

appropriate here, as the Court stated quite explicitly in

11

Sure-Tan.

12

both the board and the court of appeals looked toward

13

various provisions of the Restatement of Agency to say

14

what common law principles would shed light here.

We are dealing here with a situation in which

MR. WALLACE:

Well,

the common law of agency

really does not answer the question of how do you apply

these principles in the context of a labor management

section 7 rights and its rights under section 8.

11

Mr. Wallace,

I thought your first

argument,

though, was that this statute has a plain

13

meaning that everything that isn't excluded is included.

question of deference, right?

16

MR. WALLACE:

Well,

then you don't have any

I did point out one implied

17

exception that the Court found in the Bell Aerospace case,

18

and what I was about to say at that point in my argument

19

was that the Court's opinion in Sure-Tan, after saying

20

that the undocumented aliens fall within the plain

21

meaning,

22

interpretation that they should therefore be covered was

consistent with the purposes of the act and entitled to

It is --

But what is equivalent -- you seem to

be not wanting to put the Chevron label on it.
MR. WALLACE:

I'm very happy with what the Court

8

said in Sure-Tan.

The task of defining the term

9

employee -- and I'm looking at page 891 of that opinion --

10

is one that "has been assigned primarily to the agency

11

created by Congress to administer the act," and the Court

12

went on to say, and I'm quoting from the Court's opinion,

13

"the board's construction of that term is entitled to

14

considerable deference and we will uphold any

15

interpretation that is reasonably defensible."

QUESTION:

Did Sure-Tan come down before or

after Chevron?

the Court:

conflict between employers and unions for the votes of

If it's an

They have to

leave immediately, and I believe that's -- I think that's

the distinction.

5

The board argues that the statute includes the

6

entire class of workers.

I don't believe that's the case.

7

I think that the board routinely makes distinctions

8

between employees and nonemployees in enforcing, or

9

interpreting this Court's decision in Lechmere, and I

10

think the Hearst case, referred to by the board, holds

11

that Congress didn't intend to have a sweeping inclusion

12

of a class of employees, and I think that the Sunland

insupportable.

MR. PEASE:

6

That is my understanding of their

position.

QUESTION:

Well, what is your position on

8

whether any deference is owed to the NLRB in defining a

10

In this case, the term is

MR. PEASE:

11

I believe that the board is due

12

deference when their interpretation is reasonable and

13

consistent with the policies of the act.

14

that it's reasonable for the board to exclude the

15

definition -- from the definition of employee the law of

17

I do not believe

I believe if you read the definition of the law

18

of agency, the Congress intended to retain the core of the

19

employment relationship as the basis for protection under

the act, and I think that the analysis that they have used

21

in effect would even exclude the managerial employee, and

2

agency into the definition of employee, and I -QUESTION:

3

Is there room for -- any room for

4

interpretation, or does the word employee have a plain

5

meaning?

6

MR. PEASE:

I do believe there is room for

7

interpretation, and I believe that Congress did intend to

8

expand on the law -- on the law of agency by adding the

9

language that it's not limited to an employee of any

10

particular employer, because I think they wanted to

11

include employees in several different -- with several

12

different employers in an industry.

13

QUESTION:

So your position is, there's room for

14

interpretation, but this particular interpretation is

15

unreasonable.

16

MR. PEASE:

That's correct, and I believe -- one

17

of the reasons that I think it is is that when Congress

18

went on to explain in the definition of employee, they

19

said that it included individuals who were out of work, or

20

whose work ceased because of a current labor dispute, or

21

an unfair labor practice, and who had not obtained regular

22

and substantially equivalent employment, which implies

23

that there are other situations which would not be

24

included, and it seems to me that what it does is, it

25

shows that they were trying to take -- retain the core.

Plus I believe that I think that the board's

1
2

decision in this case is inconsistent with the policies of

3

the act.

4

its purpose is to protect the right to organize, and the

5

board at page 8 of its brief says-that they interpret it

6

as, that it's to promote organization, and I would submit

7

that what the board is doing in that situation is it is

8

saying that there is a preferred choice, and that they are

9

going to go out and support that, and to give the status

I believe that the act says that the purpose --

10

of employee to a person who's contractually prohibited

11

from exercising the rights of an employee under section 7

12

of the act, and I think that that's inconsistent with the

13

1947 amendments to the act that said that employees had

14

the right to refrain from any of those activities.

15

I think that that set up two equally acceptable

16

choices, and the board was supposed to be an impartial

17

referee, and I believe in this case, they have moved from

18

that position, and for that reason I don't think that they

19

have due deference.

QUESTION:

21

partial here, as opposed to being neutral between

organizing and nonorganizing?

This person is an agent of the union, and they're

requiring to put him on the crew, which could mean that if

7

This could apply in

I think that the point that has been made --

8

it's made in Willmar, and it's a point that I would like

9

to address.

I touched on it earlier.

I believe that the

10

board is assuming that the union agents are entitled to

11

the protection of the act, and that their analysis begins

12

with the premise that these people are employees and

13

entitled to the protection of the act, and then the

14

question becomes, have they done something to lose that

15

protection?

16

I would submit to you that it is inappropriate

17

to assume that they are employees and to make this status

18

determination as we make it in other instances of

19

supervisors, independent contractors, make that

20

independent of the presumptions of protected activity,

21

independent of the motive of the employer for engaging in

22

activity that raises the question.

23

question, and therefore we would submit that it's

24

inappropriate.

25

Oh, just one more comment.

It's a status

1

control that the union exercised over the union agent in

2

this ca&q is illustrated by the supernatural persistence

3

he displayed in soliciting Town & Country employees in the

4

face of repeated rejection.

5

These employees were so upset by the pressure

6

that the union agent was putting on them that they were on

7

the verge of quitting, and this is another way that the

8

union can be effective without going the high road,

9

because they can focus on those employees who are opposed

10

to unionization and in effect force them off the work

11

force, which means either that they will be replaced by

12

someone who might be more favorable, or that they may make

13

it impossible for the employer to perform, and that

nonunion employer is off the job.

But the problem is, Your Honor, that

frequently the objective is not to organize in the

classical sense.

that they can get leverage on the employer to force them

2

to sign a contract or keep them out of the area, and that

3

unfortunately is what we find frequently happens

4

throughout the case.

5

I do want to emphasize that I believe the

6

Sunland case, the board's analysis in that case is

7

insupportable, and I believe that using a similar

8

analysis, an analysis that we espouse, that the law of

9

agency should be used to interpret the status of people

10

and determine whether they're entitled to the protection

11

of the employees, and that the board should abandon this

12

position and should return to a position of impartiality

13

that was intended by Congress.

it's the board's own opinion on page 37a of the appendix

were made before the board that paid union organizers will
