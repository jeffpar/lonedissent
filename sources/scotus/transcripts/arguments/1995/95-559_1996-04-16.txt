ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. KRAVITZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. KRAVITZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act makes

11

12

written provisions valid, irrevocable, and enforceable

13

except for grounds that apply for the revocation of any

14

contract.

15

In this case, however, the Montana supreme court

16

refused to enforce the parties' agreement to arbitrate

17

because it failed to comply with the heightened notice

18

statute that, by its plain language, applies only to

19

arbitration agreements and not to other contracts.

20

Respondents thus have tried to recast Montana's

21

notice statute as codifying some general principle of

22

unexpectedness, but that effort fails for two reasons.

23

First, Montana's law does no such thing, since it applies

24

to only one type of provision, arbitration agreements, and

25

it applies to them whether they're unexpected or not.

Second, the FAA prevents a court from refusing

1

2

to enforce the parties' agreement to arbitrate on the

3

basis of a State law principle that turns on the fact that

4

the subject matter involved is arbitration.

5

the FAA, a State may not decide, as Montana has decided

6

here, that a contract is fair enough to enforce its basic

7

terms but not fair enough to enforce its arbitration

8

clause.

9

Thus, under

Congress enacted the Federal Arbitration Act to

10

clear away judicial and legislative suspicion of

11

arbitration, in and so doing, Congress decided for itself

12

to determine the circumstances under which arbitration

13

clauses would be enforceable, unencumbered by State law

14

constraints.

15

To that end, the text of section 2 alone

16

determines the enforceability of an arbitration agreement,

17

and that text provides that arbitration provisions are

18

enforceable and valid and irrevocable, save for one

19

explicit, and explicitly limited, exception:

20

that exist for the revocation of any contract.

21

upon grounds

We believe that in determining whether or not a

22

State law or principle fits within that savings clause,

23

two considerations are paramount.

24

clause is an exception to a sweeping general rule of

25

enforcement.

First, the savings

1

not to allow the exceptions to swallow or undercut the

2

general rule.

3

Second, section 2 establishes a principle of

4

what I'll call rigorous equality for arbitration clauses.

5

They may be no less valid, no less enforceable, and no

6

less irrevocable than other contract terms under State

7

law.
As a result, this Court has identified two tests

8

9

that State laws or principles must pass before a law fits

10

within the savings clause.

11

general application.

That is to say, it must apply to

12

contracts generally.

Secondly, even if it is in theory a

13

general principle of law, the particularized application

14

of that general principle cannot turn on the fact that the

15

subject matter involved is arbitration.

16

QUESTION:

First, the law must be one of

Suppose that the State had a statute

17

which said that the following terms have to be in bold

Would that be a valid State law that's enforceable?

MR. KRAVITZ:

Depending upon the law, the nature

22

of the law and the things that are included, I think not,

23

and I think it would fail really under two principles.

24

First, unless the list was quite long, it would not apply

25

to contracts generally but just apply to a few things, and

ask yourself really the second -QUESTION:

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. KRAVITZ:

Of course, the more things you put

18

in it, the more it looks like a general principle, but

19

then you have to ask yourself, it seems to me, the second

20

test, which is, why does it make the list?

21

Why does arbitration make the list, and if it's

22

making the list because, of course, the court feels that

23

they're concerned about people arbitrating as opposed to

24

litigating disputes, they think that they're giving up an

25

especially important right, then, depending upon the size

and were general.

MR. KRAVITZ:

1

Well, it would -- for -- I believe

it would cause the same problems that we're addressing, if

I may explain.

litigation and arbitration, it begins to look more

Assuming that it applies just to both

However, what the State is saying in that

7

circumstance, the circumstance you're positing, is, okay,

8

well, we'll let you arbitrate, but you have to do it under

9

our rules, and I believe that when the court -- when the

10

States are permitted to start tinkering with the parties'

11

choices about how they wish to arbitrate, it raises many

12

of the same concerns.

13

QUESTION:

For example, if the court -Suppose -- do you have any doubt

14

about whether such a provision would be valid as to choice

15

of a court?

-- any choice of law to govern this

contract has to be put in -- on page 1?
MR. KRAVITZ:

The FAA does not speak to such

21

clauses, and certainly that would not run afoul of the

22

Federal Arbitration Act.

23

QUESTION:

Whether there's anything else --

Well then, you seem to be saying the

about choice of forum can apply to all other contracts but

2

not to arbitration contracts.

3

MR. KRAVITZ:

What I'm saying is, Your Honor,

4

and obviously the hypothetical you're posing is very

5

different from the statute, what I'm saying is that as the

6

States begin to tinker with the parties' choices of the

7

rules under which they'll conduct their arbitration, you

8

begin to raise the same issues.

9

For example, if I may, if a State said, okay,

10

you can arbitrate, but you have -- the arbitrators have to

11

be chosen from the voter rolls in a certain town, and you

12

have to have

5
6

2 arbitrators, and all the rules of evidence

have to apply -QUESTION:

What does that have to do with saying

choice of forum has to be on page
MR. KRAVITZ:

?

Because I think that to the extent

7

that one is tinkering with the choice that the parties

8

made of the method in which they're going to resolve their

9

dispute, that it raises the issue as to whether or not one

20

is trying to interfere with the parties' choice of

21

arbitration, or one is trying to do something else.

22

QUESTION:

Isn't the --

23

QUESTION:

Of course, one of the underlying

24

issues here is that in these cases typically one party

25

will say, I didn't make this choice.

I didn't know

anything about it. I signed this thing.
If we are concerned that this is happening more

2

3

and more, do the Federal courts have the authority to

4

develop a law of adhesion of contracts so that as a matter

5

of Federal common law, I suppose under the Arbitration

6

Clause, the courts could develop certain rules to protect

7

the parties?
MR. KRAVITZ:

8

9

Well, Your Honor, I believe that

the text of section 2 provides the answer to that, and

10

that text says that the written provisions are valid,

11

irrevocable, and enforceable, whether in State court or

12

Federal court, save upon grounds that exist for the

13

revocation of any contract, which is to say contracts

14

generally.

15

Now, this Court in Perry and in First Options

16

has said that you look to State rule, has made the choice

17

that -- let me step back, said as a matter of Federal law,

18

therefore, the arbitration agreement is valid and

19

enforceable.

20

The court has then looked to State principles of

21

general application on revocability, but it has done that

22

because the statute so provides, so I think that the court

23

would be prohibited from developing specialized rules

24

under some sort of Federal common law designed to impose

25

on arbitration agreements limitations that are not

There's something of a vacuum then,

isn't there.
MR. KRAVITZ:

8

9

Yes, even though the evil

thought --

6

7

Even though the evil sought to be

Well, but the law generally, of

course, is that all of the terms in a forum contract, an

10

adhesion contract are, in fact, presumptively valid, if

11

you put your signature on it, so that in fact the law of

12

contracts generally would say these are valid, and that

13

law of contracts generally is being skewed solely -- it's

14

singling out arbitration, and solely because of the fact

15

that it's arbitration involved as opposed to something

16

else.

17

And one must ask oneself, why is one skewing the

18

law that way, and it is because one is making a value

19

judgment that arbitration is perhaps less good than a

20

court proceeding, or the like, precisely the value

21

judgment Congress sought to take the way from both Federal

22

courts and State courts and State legislatures when it

23

enacted the FAA.

2

application to arbitration agreements to any degree beyond

3

their application to any other choice of forum agreements,

4

if we knew that there was no reason to suppose that it was

5

aimed at arbitration agreements, that it was being

6

enforced sort of evenhandedly with all choice of forum

7

agreements, and that there were plenty of choice of forum

agreements which were not arbitration agreements, in that

case we would say, that's general enough, and that

As far as its generality is

concerned, the one is the same as the other.

3

MR. KRAVITZ:

4

QUESTION:

5

That is correct.

And you would certainly not assert

that the latter is okay under the FAA, would you?
MR. KRAVITZ:

6

No, I would not, and indeed, just

7

to follow up on that point, it has been argued by the

8

respondents that this is just a notice statute.

9

doesn't affect the enforceability of these clauses.

10

This
But

that argument is simply not so.
This law, which is labeled a notice law, says

11
12

that arbitration clauses containing agreement without

13

notice are not enforceable, whereas the other terms in the

14

same agreement, without notice, are enforceable, so this

15

statute, which is nominally denominated in a notice

16

statute does, in fact, go to the enforceability of the

17

arbitration clause.

Are there other provisions -- what

other statutes or rules of law in Montana require other

kinds of clauses besides arbitration clauses to be typed

that a disclaimer of implied warranties has to be

That's a heightened notice statute.

I believe the respondents make reference to

8

retail instalment contracts requiring certain disclosures.

9

I don't believe they're underlined in capital letters.
But basically, we're talking about not the law

generally in Montana.
QUESTION:

12

Well, I mean, that would be the

question.

14

this, and this is not different, then I guess it isn't

just for arbitration, and if, in fact, this seems to be

quite different, or there are only a handful, then it does

seem different just for arbitration.

don't believe it is, but let's say it was even 5 or

0,

2

we're not talking about a coherent body of general law

3

applicable generally, we're talking about things that are

4

singled out, and why -- and they're singling out

5

arbitration in this statute in the same way in which

6

they're singling out other things and not applying the law

7

generally, because the law generally says that these

8

clauses, even if it's in an adhesion contract, even if

9

there's unequal bargaining power, if the signature's on

10

it, these clauses are -- everything else in that contract

is presumptively valid.

12

QUESTION:

You're saying that if there are

several other examples, but in separate part of the

statutes it still shows kind of an ad hoc approach to each

particular thing rather than a general feeling that all of

these particular things should be subject to heightened
notice.

But -If that were the general principle

announced, then you'd go to the second prong of our test,

which is, is it's application in that particular

arbitration, and the answer is no.

9

that there's no acceptance.
QUESTION:

But then it becomes complicated when

11

you get to examples in which there's a whole series of

terms upon which it may turn, and I think you're saying,

but I'm not sure, no matter how long that series might be,

go back to our -- the two tests that this Court has

identified?

as a law of general application, but it's -- the second

part is, why does it -- why is it being applied in this

For example, Justice Breyer, I'm not aware of

any principle in Montana law that waiving any

first page.

6

You can waive a jury trial -- you can waive

these things under Montana law, and nothing special is

8

required, but something is specially required of

9

arbitration under Montana law, and it -- and the court

10

explained why something special was required, and that was

11

because the court itself and the legislature were

concerned about citizens in Montana agreeing to a

procedure that that court felt was devoid of all

Court has done in its cases, which is to say, insist, as

2

the language does, that only laws or principles that apply

3

to contracts generally can be used to revoke an

4

arbitration clause, and it's important for really two

5

reasons.
The first is that, if you want to allow States

6

7

to add additional limitations, their own special rules or

8

processes for arbitration agreements, it inevitably

9

undercuts the enforceability of arbitration, and it makes

10

them -- puts them on a different footing than other

11

contracts, so it impairs not only the words -- violates

12

the words as such, but impairs Congress' intent that this

any other contract.

the parties intended that that was the result.

2

would a nonarbitration clause, and so if, in fact, the

3

court were overriding one clause of the agreement with

another clause of the agreement and doing so because

5

arbitration was involved as opposed to some other term,

then that would run afoul of the FAA in the same

circumstance, even when they chose Montana law in that

that is what courts have been doing with Volt, contrary, I

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

The issue presented in this case is whether a
Montana notice statute,

a statute which is aimed at

10

ensuring that parties know that they're signing a contract

11

that includes an arbitration provision,

12

the Federal Arbitration Act.

3

is preempted by

The Montana notice requirement is different from

4

all the State requirements that this Court has preempted

5

in the past because its function is not to prevent

6

arbitration but to help ensure that arbitration is

7

consensual.

8

The statutes preempted in Southland,

9

and in Terminex prevented the enforcement of arbitration

20

agreements so that there was nothing a person who wanted

21

to enforce arbitration could do to make sure that it would

22

be enforced.

23

Here,

on the other hand,

in Perry,

it's in the total

24

control of the person drafting the agreement to make sure

25

that the arbitration provision will be enforced.

MS. SIKES:

Suppose for a moment that Montana had not

adopted the statutory notice requirement, but we had

12

similar facts, so that the plaintiff had tried to sue --

13

had filed a suit in court, the defendant had sought to

14

stay litigation in order to compel arbitration, then the

15

plaintiff could have gone into court and said that the

16

arbitration was invalid under general contract principles

17

that unexpected clauses in contracts need to be

18

conspicuous.

19

And in that case, I don't think that would have

20

been prevented by the Federal Arbitration Act, because

21

what the Court would be doing in that case is applying a

general contract principle of unexpected -- of reasonable

expectations doctrine to the arbitration provision and

invalidating it, and that that's simply what the Montana

applied in sort of an undisciplined fashion by courts so

that it could be used to single out arbitration, or if it

was shown that it was applied in a way which, by whatever

set of principles, the State courts were -- tended to fall

12

heavily on arbitration, or if it could be shown that it

13

was intended as a common law rule really to apply to

14

arbitration and make it more difficult, we would say that

15

there was not, in fact, a sufficient generality there, and

that therefore the rule, the unexpectedness concept would

fail because it wasn't sufficiently general, and we just

don't know enough, I guess, even if we had the case that

The first is this, and it was the second point

1

2

that I made in my opening.

3

this statute merely codifies some general principle of

4

expectedness, which I don't think it does, but assuming

5

for a moment that it does, as Ms. Sikes has said, it still

6

falls under the FAA, so it would not be possible on remand

7

for the Montana supreme court to decide we're now going to

8

apply a general principle.

10

Regardless of whether or not

The general principle is

We're not going to call it a statute, we're

11

going to call it a general principle, and we're going to

12

find that this is unexpected because Montana has outlawed

13

arbitration for 100 years, and therefore no one in Montana

14

would expect such a clause, and this Court dealt with

15

precisely that issue in Perry.

16

In footnote 9 in Perry the Court said, you

17

cannot have a statute that singles out arbitration, but it

didn't stop there.

thing more.

20

general applicability, and in that case it was the law of

21

unconscionability, one can -- a State cannot decide that a

22

principle is violated on the basis of the fact that

23

arbitration is involved because after all, if that's what

24

could be done, then the courts could do that which this

25

Court has said the legislatures may not do.

It went on and said, but there's one

10

absolutely right, Justice Stevens, and let me say one

other thing.
The second point I wanted to make was that this

13

statute, Ms. Sikes says it's easy to comply with.

14

suggest to the court that the test that this Court has

15

announced is not whether it's easy to comply with, but you

have looked at what is required of other terms in the

17

contract.

I

And looked at from that point of view, which is

19

the point of view that the FAA requires, other terms in

20

this particular contract don't have to be in underlined

21

capital letters, it's only the arbitration clause that

22

must be, and so the fact that we might be able to comply

23

for this one clause doesn't satisfy the test.

24

that this Court has to look through is the lens as to how

25

other clauses are treated.

One final note is this.

This Court will read
