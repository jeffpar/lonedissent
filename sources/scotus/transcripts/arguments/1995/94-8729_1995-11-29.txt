Well, it makes it very difficult,

doesn't it, to decide this case when we don't know the

nature of the ownership or what rights a single co-owner

16

would have.

17

MR. HERPEL:

Well, I think it -- I'm quite

certain that the sole co-owner does not have the right to

wondered the same thing.

2

should take an assumption that the supreme court of

3

Michigan -- did the supreme court make an assumption,

4

namely the assumption that the ownership interest of your

5

client was such that she had an interest that otherwise

6

couldn't be touched, it was her property, she had an

7

undivided interest or some interest that was totally hers?
MR. HERPEL:

8
9

12

That much I'm quite sure of, Your

Honor.

10
11

I thought maybe we're -- that we

QUESTION:
we make?

So what kind of an assumption should

What kind of assumption did they make?
MR. HERPEL:

Well, I think that they clearly

13

made an assumption that she had a separately protectable

14

interest in this car, for which --

Sr

15

QUESTION:

So you're saying even if she had, it

16

was just like totally separate property under Michigan

17

law, she has under Michigan law something that's a 50-

18

percent separate interest, whatever that might mean --

19

MR. HERPEL:

20

QUESTION:

21
22
23

Yes, I would say -Well, I'm looking for the same thing.

What kind of assumption do we make?
MR. HERPEL:

Again, I would analogize it to a

tenancy in common.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. HERPEL:

Like a tenancy in common.
She had the interest that one joint

1

owner in a tenancy in common would have, or one tenant.
QUESTION:

2

Does one usually hold cars by tenancy

3

in common?

Isn't -- but in any event, he is at least

4

half-owner, and you can't impound half a car, and you

5

can't sell at an auction half a car, so in effect your

6

position seems to be that she, because she is half-owner,

7

can immunize him against having his property taken, is

8

that essentially your position?

9

MR. HERPEL:

No, Justice Ginsburg, we're not

10

contending that the State has no power to forfeit the

11

vehicle.

12

compensating Tina Bennis, the innocent owner, for her

13

interest.

14

What we are saying is they cannot do so without

QUESTION:

Well then, why can't -- but you're

15

not saying it would be enough to give her whatever

16

pittance was left from this sale after administrative

17

expenses.

18

MR. HERPEL:

Well, I would -- we would contend,

19

Your Honor, that so-called administrative expenses,

20

attorney's fees, prosecutorial attorney fees and court

21

costs, Detroit police costs, are not properly assessable

22

against her interest, that that -- as a matter of

23

constitutional law that it is improper to assess those

24

costs against her --

25

QUESTION:

Is it all right for the State to say

1

this vehicle is a public nuisance because of its use?
MR. HERPEL:

2

Well, the court -- the court

3

certainly exceeded traditional notions of what constitutes

4

a public nuisance.
QUESTION:

5

But didn't it -- suppose it had been

6

his car entirely, couldn't they have -- would there have

7

been anything unconstitutional about the forfeiture?
MR. HERPEL:

8

9

I don't think the Court has to find

that in this case, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

10

We've held in any number of cases

11

that there's not, that something that's used in the course

12

of committing a felony can be forfeited.

13

MR. HERPEL:

I agree, Your Honor, and I only

14

hesitated because the Michigan supreme court applied an

15

extremely novel interpretation of nuisance law, but I

16

don't want to be sidetracked on that issue, because the

17

focus here is on the forfeitability of her interest in the

18

car.

19

QUESTION:

Just before we get too far away from

20

the answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, if the State

21

can forfeit the husband's interest and in your position it

22

has to remit to the wife her interest -- I take it that's

23

your position.

24

MR. HERPEL:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, it is, Justice Kennedy.
Does the State have to compensate the

1

wife for the loss of use of the property, her portion of

2

the property while the forfeiture proceedings are being

3

conducted?

4

MR. HERPEL:

Your Honor, I guess that gest into

5

the issue of whether pre-hearing seizure is appropriate,

6

which is not presented in this case.

7

hearing seizure, which is what was accomplished here, is

8

appropriate, I don't know that she would have a claim for

9

the loss of use of the vehicle in that interim period, if

10
11

15

Assuming that pre-

that is your question.
QUESTION:

But doesn't that indicate the

necessity of having a forfeiture provision such as this?
MR. HERPEL:

I'm afraid I don't understand your

question, Justice Kennedy.
QUESTION:

Well, if the most efficient way, if

16

the only efficient way for the State to enforce its laws,

17

let's say, is to forfeit the offending vehicle, then the

18

forfeiture system is adequate, and all you're asking for

19

is that the wife's financial interest in the automobile

20

represented by her half of the equity be returned to her,

21

is that your position?

22

23
24
25

MR. HERPEL:

That's the position that we're

taking in this case, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

And in this case it's a 1977

automobile?

MR. HERPEL:

MR. HERPEL:

QUESTION:

c

6

That is correct, Justice -What kind of automobile?
It was a Pontiac sedan.
And so her interest would be about

what, would you say?
MR. HERPEL:

Well, presumptively it would be

7

50 percent of the resale value of the car.

I believe the

8

car was purchased approximately -- the record will show

9

that it was purchased approximately 1 month before the

10

forfeiture, and she did testify that she provided most of

11

the purchase money for the car, that there may be an

12

opportunity to rebut the presumption of 50 percent --

13

14

QUESTION:

MR. HERPEL:

16

QUESTION:

$600.
So we're talking about a claim of

$300 for her.

18

MR. HERPEL:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, at least $300.
Mr. Herpel, you referred to your

20

client as an innocent owner, and how do you define

21

innocent owner for these purposes?

22

Does

the record tell us that?

15

17

And how much was paid for it?

MR. HERPEL:

Well, Your Honor, there are -- we

23

propose a standard for defining innocence that we term the

24

negligent entrustment standard, which focuses on whether

25

the owner knew or should have known of the impending

alternative standard.

3

under either standard, either the all reasonable steps

4

standard proposed by the Solicitor General, or the

5

negligent entrustment standard, which focuses on whether

6

the owner knew or had reason to know of the illegal use.

7

The Solicitor General has proposed an

QUESTION:

We contend that she would prevail

Well, let's assume the standard is

8

negligence, what could she have done -- what if she knew

9

in this case that her husband was likely to resort to

10

prostitutes using the car, would she have had a right to

11

stop him from using it?

It's half his car.
MR. HERPEL:

But if the time of entrustment is

deemed to be the time -QUESTION:

Why is there an entrustment?

He's

MR. HERPEL:

I agree that after the creation of

the joint property interest there formally can be no

QUESTION:

Okay.

Let's assume we're at that

point, and she finds out that he's doing these things on

3

the way home, she would have had no right to stop him from

4

using the car, would she?

QUESTION:

That's correct.
What should she have done in order to

satisfy a negligence standard?

MR. HERPEL:

QUESTION:

14

Well, I mean -Are we assuming --- I -- if we're going to have a

negligence standard, does -- how would it be applied here?
MR. HERPEL:

15
16

Should she have called the

Well, Your Honor, if I may, I'd

just like to digress briefly that the focus --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. HERPEL:

Briefly.
-- is on the time of entrustment,

19

which in a joint ownership situation I think would be

20

deemed the time the joint property interest is created.

21

Now - -

23

QUESTION:

If she should have known at that time

that he was a scoundrel, that would suffice?

Yes.

I think if she knew of the

impending illegal use at that time.

2

Now, post entrustment --

3

QUESTION:

Specifically the impending illegal

4

use.

It can't be enough that this not a really reliable

5

person that I wouldn't trust the car with, Lord knows what

6

he'll do with it?
MR. HERPEL:

7
8

Justice Scalia, I think it should

be specific to the illegal use --

9

QUESTION:
MR. HERPEL:

10

Wow.
-- that gives rise to the

11

forfeiture under the statute.

12

QUESTION:

All right, but in any case, in this

13

case is there any evidence in the record that she knew at

14

the time the purchase -- the car was purchased that he

15

might use it in this fashion?

16

MR. HERPEL:

17

QUESTION:

No, to the contrary.
So your position is going to be, if

18

you win this case, that that's the end of the case, that

19

there's no evidence of negligence at that time, and

20

therefore what she may have learned, even if she had known

21

post purchase, would be irrelevant, and that that's the

22

end of the case.

23
24
25

She's entitled to her 50 percent share.

MR. HERPEL:

Certainly that's true in this

case -QUESTION:

Yes.

because the record shows that

MR. HERPEL:

1

2

there is no knowledge at any time up until the time of

3

illegal use, but I -- you know, the Court could pose

4

cases, hypotheticals --

QUESTION:

MR. HERPEL:

8

9

Right.
-- that if somebody acquired

May I ask you a different question?

Let's assume that at the time of the purchase she knew,

10

but she was not putting up any of the money and he simply

11

said, I'm buying this car, and I want the title issued and

12

so on, the registration issued to my wife and to me, and

13

he says to her, you have a half interest in the car, can

14

that half interest be taken from her on the assumption

15

that she knew at that time what he was likely to do with

16

the car?

17

MR. HERPEL:

18

QUESTION:

I would think it can be taken.
What should she have done?

She had

19

no role in the purchase of the car, and she had no role in

20

the transfer of a 50-percent interest to her.

21

she have done?

22

MR. HERPEL:

23

QUESTION:

24

that one, I think, isn't it?

What should

MR. HERPEL:

It could well be( Justice Scalia.

2

I think that --

3

QUESTION:

You answered the question.

You said,

4

this vehicle was purchased for $600, so that the -- what

5

we're talking about, you have conceded she doesn't get the

6

car, the State can take the car, so as a matter of

7

constitutional right, your argument is, she's entitled to

8

half of the value.

9

Well, if she bought it -- the total price was

10

$600, and they had it even for a day, then the value is

11

less than $600, isn't it?

12

MR. HERPEL:

Well, I guess it depends on how

13

good a bargain they struck initially, Your Honor, but

14

certainly that $600 is evidence of its value.

15

know that it's conclusive evidence, that perhaps --

16

QUESTION:

I don't

So when you said at least $600, or at

17

least $300, that means you're assuming they made a good --

18

a very good bargain.

19

MR. HERPEL:

Well, I guess what I was referring

20

to there, Your Honor, is I think in a tenancy in common

21

situation, which I analogize this to, there's a

22

presumption --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Why don't you say joint tenancy?

Why

do you pick the phrase, tenancy in common?
MR. HERPEL:

rights of survivorship that attach under the Michigan

2

automobile registration statute.

3

QUESTION:

Suppose that a State had a statute

4

which said that any registered owner of an automobile is

5

absolutely liable for damages that the automobile does in

6

a collision, and the husband gets in a collision, is the

7

wife subject to liability consistently with the

8

Constitution?

9

MR. HERPEL:

Well, I think the Court has taken

10

for granted the constitutionality of the co-called civil

11

liability statutes for automobile owners.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. HERPEL:

Why should this case be different?
It's different in two critical

14

respects, Justice Kennedy.

15

the tort system, and are designed not to punish but simply

16

to shift losses so as to facilitate recoveries, tort

17

recoveries by plaintiffs to compensate for injury.

18

First, such statutes arise in

Second, and perhaps most important, generally

19

speaking, the State would not be the plaintiff in such an

20

action, and the full machinery of the State with its

21

potential for oppression is not arrayed against the

22

individual.

about an application of the law to a situation that is

No, but I want to know what the

theory -- and this is -- Justice O'Connor was -- what is

the theory of the State's right to forfeit, and a moment

ago, if I understood you correctly, you said it has

nothing to do with the question whether the so-called

you are saying, I think, that it does depend on the right

to control, because the answer is different in the case of

the stolen car, and the answer is different in the case of

the rental car.

21

Is control relevant, or isn't it?

MR. ROBERTS:

Control is relevant only to the

I think Justice Souter's point is

That's correct.

Then why shouldn't the wife be in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD H. SEAMON

3

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

7

MR. SEAMON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to begin by discussing some of the

8

issues that I believe complicate what's already a

9

difficult constitutional question.

10

The first issue has to do with precisely what

11

rights co-owners have to control the property's use by

12

other co-owners.

13

issue of control is highly relevant under the all

14

reasonable steps standard that we propose.

15

That is not clear, and in our view, the

QUESTION:

So if the -- going back to the

16

argument that counsel on the other side made, if the co­

17

owner did not know at the time of acquiring ownership that

18

the property was likely to be used by the other co-owner

19

for a criminal purpose, and subsequently learns it, there

20

would be no right of control at that point.

21

There would be no fault, and it would not be

22

forfeitable.

23

owner's interest would not be forfeitable, on your theory.

25

The co-owner's interest, the innocent co­

suggestion of a negligent entrustment standard, because we

2

think that it's unrealistic to focus simply on the point

3

in time at which the property is transferred from one

4

owner to another or the time at which the co-owner's

5

property interest arises.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Seamon, where -- I mean, as an

7

original matter, if I were writing a statute I might well

8

buy your, you know, all reasonable steps standard.

9

seems like a good idea.
But we're not writing a statute.

Where do you

11

get it from?

I mean, where do you find it in our

historical tradition, or is it just that, you know, we

constitutional law.

Marshall wrote for the Court in 1808 that a property

should not be forfeited when the owner of the property

lacks the means to prevent the forfeiture.

1

MR. SEAMON:

That's right, and we see two lines

2

of cases, really, one of which includes Goldsmith, Grant,

3

Van Oster, and Calero-Toledo itself, which recognizes that

4

a property owner cannot avoid the forfeiture of property

5

that's been used illegally merely by showing that she

6

lacked knowledge or even reason to know of the illegal

7

use.

8

9

By the same token, there is another different
line of cases, of which Calero-Toledo is also a part, that

10

recognizes limitations on the Government's ability to

11

punish people.

It seems a rather significant

distinction.
MR. SEAMON:

It is a significant distinction.

18

The one exception I would note to that, but it's not a

19

forfeiture case, is the one we cite in our brief,

20

Southwestern Telephone & Telegraph Company v. Danaher,

21

which involved the Court -- in which the Court set aside a

$6,300 civil penalty against a phone company on the

grounds that the phone company had acted reasonably and

there was no wrongdoing that justified --

understand is how you put together your test with your end

2

result, because it seems to me that in many, many, perhaps

3

most marital situations, a person in Tina Bennis'

4

situation could do everything within her power to do, but

5

the law gives the co-owner the right to use the car

6

whenever and however he wants, so I don't see how the all

7

reasonable steps would work out to the disfavor of someone

8

in Tina Bennis' situation.

9

MR. SEAMON:
QUESTION:

10

It may be that -She has no power over him.

She could

11

say everything she wants and it's not going to do any

12

good.

13

MR. SEAMON:

Our view of the result, I suppose,

14

is in part based on presumptions about how the State law

15

operates in terms of the degree of control that a joint

16

owner can exercise over another owner.

17

Certainly, it would not be reasonable to expect

18

a co-owner to do anything that she didn't have a right to

19

do under the State law.

On the other hand, every citizen can take

21

certain measures to prevent illegal activity that comes --

that they learn about, including calling the police, and

MR. SEAMON:

1

It's very difficult to know in the

2

absence of knowing more about how much knowledge or reason

3

to suspect that use she had, which is unclear to us on

4

this record.

5

6

illegal use, but she did not show that she lacked a reason

to suspect that --

In our view, all that she showed in the

Would it have been a different case,

11

had no idea this was going on?

12

MR. SEAMON:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. SEAMON:

Yes.
That would be the difference.
Yes, but I would emphasize in

15

answering the question that it has a lot to do with the

16

nature of the offense involved here, which is I think

17

another complication.

18

I mean, it is reasonable to expect that a

19

husband who frequents prostitutes will hide that fact from

20

his wife and be able to do that successfully, but that may

21

not necessarily be true if a different offense is

involved, such as ongoing drug trafficking, and --
