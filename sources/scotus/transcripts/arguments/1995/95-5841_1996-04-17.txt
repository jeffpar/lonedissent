ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA BURGET WRIGHT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

You may

proceed.

Do you

MS. WRIGHT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case presents a question about when

18

seizures of motorists are unreasonable within the meaning

19

of the Fourth Amendment.

20

In the Government's view, probable cause of any

21

traffic infraction is a floor above which it is per se

22

reasonable to stop any motorist, but the ultimate test

23

under the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, not probable

24

cause, and given the potential for abuse of a mere

25

probable cause standard in the traffic enforcement

1

context, we believe that the probable cause standard does

2

not automatically strike the appropriate balance in each

3

and every case.

4

To contrast our position in concrete terms, if

5

the floor represents probable cause, or the string hanging

6

from the motorist's rear view mirror, or probable cause

7

that the motorist glanced at his watch or changed the

8

radio station, or probable cause that the motorist

9

signaled for only 2-1/2 seconds rather than 3 seconds

10

before changing lanes, and the ceiling is probable cause

11

is the most serious traffic infraction we can imagine,

12

then under the Government's view, the police have complete

13

discretion anywhere between the floor and the ceiling to

14

make a stop.

15

QUESTION:

Let me ask you this, if I may,

16

Ms. Wright.

Does the fact that the arresting officer is

17

in plain clothes and in an unmarked vehicle and that the

18

officer's observations are for a supposedly minor traffic

19

offense, do those factors all go into the pot in

20

determining under the Fourth Amendment whether the traffic

21

stop is reasonable?

22

MS. WRIGHT:

23

QUESTION:

If -Is there -- is that part of the mix

24

or not, or do we only consider what it is the officer

25

observed without considering the fact that it is an

2

unmarked vehicle and a nonuniformed officer?
MS. WRIGHT:

I think that if there is a policy

3

that takes in - - that incorporates those sorts of

4

concerns, what car the officer is in, or how the officer's

5

dressed, then I think they are relevant, because the

6

officer, under our view, would have to comply with the

7

departmental policies.

8

QUESTION:

9

MS. WRIGHT:

10
11

You mean a departmental policy?
Departmental, or possibly even

within their district.
QUESTION:

The officer was supposed to be in

12

uniform and in fact he was in plain clothes, then that

13

could be a factor in saying that the stop was not proper?

14

MS. WRIGHT:

If there was a policy that said

15

that traffic stops were not ever to be made by

16

plainclothes officers, yes, we think that would --

17
18
19

QUESTION:
forth explicitly.

It has to be a policy that is set
It isn't just the common practice.

I thought your argument was more than just an

20

explicit policy.

I thought that even though the officers

21

were neither prohibited by the letter of the law, nor even

22

by any explicit mandate of their department from making a

23

stop for a technical violation, if, indeed, it was the

24

practice that all of the officers of the department used

25

not to stop for technical violation, that would be enough

to render it violative.

2

Isn't that what you were arguing, or is it?

3

MS. WRIGHT:

Well,

standard practice,

5

of following that practice.

7

in essence the department has a policy

policy, then.

I think that if there is a

Okay.

That's what you mean by a

You just mean the standard practice.

MS. WRIGHT:

QUESTION:

Practice, correct, in the first -Now, what troubles me about your

10

argument is,

11

argument.

12

whether he could have stopped, or would have stopped.

13

it, you know, the woulda-coulda-shoulda

I mean, whether it should be -- you know,

To draw the line at would have stopped,

that is,

14

to require the officer to be following the standard

15

practice, seems to make a lot of sense if you only apply

16

it in these evidentiary exclusionary cases, where, you

17

know, they stop a car and find drugs, as here, and then

18

try to introduce the drugs.

19

But you can't limit that policy to that.

The

20

result of that policy would be that any officer in the

21

whole department who follows the letter of the law but

22

does not follow the general practice of the department

23

stops an innocent motorist, does not find drugs, but the

24

motorist gets mad and says, what do you mean,

25

for a broken taillight, and then sues the officer under

1983, or the department under 1983, and you are guilty of

2

a violation of the Fourth Amendment, isn't that right?

3

MS. WRIGHT:

4

QUESTION:

That would -There's no officer in the department

5

can act technically under the law if the rest of the

6

department is being more liberal, and he violates the

7

fourth Amendment if he does that.

MS. WRIGHT:

citizen would have --

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. WRIGHT:

That is correct, theoretically a

Yes.
--a civil suit, but I think we're

12

talking about an extremely small number of cases where

13

this is going to happen, because the sort of discretion

14

that's granted even under the would-have test is quite

15

large.

16

there's probable cause of a violation that is - - that the

17

police are authorized to and do, in fact, enforce.

18

We just set the threshold at the level at which

QUESTION:

But violation of the Fourth Amendment

19

is, you know, to my mind a big deal, and I don't go, you

20

know, tossing it around arbitrarily, and to say that every

21

time a policeman, although he's technically correct in

22

making a stop, is not as liberal as the rest of his

23

colleagues in the department, he thereby violates the

24

Fourth Amendment, does not strike me as true.

MS. WRIGHT:

Well, I think an analogy might be

QUESTION:

Well,

I think your answer to Justice

10

Scalia was candid, and I think is consistent with your

11

position, but I think it exposes some real difficulties.

12

In addition to the ones that the Justice mentioned,

13

seems to me that this makes certain traffic laws simply a

14

dead letter at the option of the police department.

15

MS. WRIGHT:

Well,

it

I think that's already what

16

in effect is happening.

17

that if this is the practice, then this is the standard

18

practice and the police need to stick within that standard

practice in order to have their --

QUESTION:

It's just recognizing the reality

But the police don't have the

21

authority to tell the legislature which traffic laws are

22

to be repealed.

Well,

it's not that it's repealed,

of course, and they can change their policy or practice

any time, but there's no - - the notion of full enforcement

1

is really -- there is no -- it's not even a myth any more.

2

Nobody believes that there's such a thing as full

3

enforcement.

4

The legislature doesn't fund the police

5

department to do full enforcement, so it's understood by

6

the legislature that there will be some selectivity in

7

policy, and the notion that -- all we're saying as far as

8

the civil remedy -- I don't think there's anything unusual

9

about the idea that when police act unreasonably, which by

10
11

definition they are in our situation, that they -QUESTION:

You say police are acting

12

unreasonably in your situation.

Now, was -- I take it

13

from what you say there's a departure from established

14

department policy in this case.

15

MS. WRIGHT:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. WRIGHT:

Correct.
What was that departure?
Well, the department has mandated

18

that traffic enforcement shall not be undertaken by

19

officers in unmarked cars or in plain clothes unless

20

there's an immediate threat to the public safety posed by

21

the violation, essentially one that would outweigh the

22

danger that's being posed by a stop by an unmarked car.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

And so in this case it was a

plainclothesman who made the traffic stop.
MS. WRIGHT:

Correct.

QUESTION:

1

Why on earth should that be a

2

violation of the Fourth Amendment, simply to depart from

3

department policy?

4

MS. WRIGHT:

Well, if the police are not

5

required to constrain their own discretion by maintaining

6

adherence to their own policies, then because of the

7

unique nature of civil traffic enforcement, and traffic

8

enforcement in general, they will have the same amount of

9

discretion as a practical matter as this Court found

10

improper in Prouse and unconstitutional in Prouse, and

11

that's why there has to - QUESTION:

12

13

Well, that was total discretion in

Prouse.

14

MS. WRIGHT:

Well, it's our position that as a

15

practical matter the police really have the same

16

discretion in the civil traffic area, and I don't read

17

the - -

18

QUESTION:

Well, but can you general -- I

mean,

19

we're talking about a holding that would presumably bind

20

courts all over the country.

Can you be that sure of what

I

21

the various police departments all over the country

22

prescribe?

23

MS. WRIGHT:

Well, it would -- obviously, the

24

conduct would be judged by whichever policies govern the

25

particular officer, whatever department he was in, and so

1

just as in Florida v. Wells, you know, opening a

2

particular container might be permissible -4

3

QUESTION:

So if a police department then said

4

that plainclothesmen as well as uniformed police can make

5

traffic stops, then this would have been perfectly all

6

right in that kind of a department.

7

MS. WRIGHT:

I think that's correct, assuming

8

there were not other policies that prohibited this

9

particular kind of stop.
QUESTION:

10

So a violation of the Fourth

11

Amendment is dependent on what kind of a policy that the

12

particular police department has.

13

MS. WRIGHT:

Well, I think that's exactly what

14

this Court said in Florida v. Wells, that a container can

15

be opened in one jurisdiction if there are policies

16

governing that, but not in another.

17

QUESTION:

Well, that was an inventory search,

18

which we've always said had to be personal to some sort of

19

a policy, and you say we should carry over that rule here.
Wouldn't it in fact, if your view is adopted,

20
21

wouldn't that lead to pretty elaborate testimony at, say,

22

a suppression hearing as to what the department policy

23

was?

24

take it your argument isn't limited to that.

25

interrogate officers about what was the practice.

Supposing there wasn't any written policy, but I

that be permissible?
MS. WRIGHT:

would be very difficult.

4
5

Yes, it would, but I don't think it

QUESTION:

It might not be difficult, but it

would be time-consuming.
MS. WRIGHT:

6

Not necessarily.

I mean, I think

7

that in most cases the issue will be resolved with the

8

officer who made the stop on the stand.
QUESTION:

9
10

As it was in this case.

Soto said, I

don't do this.

11

MS. WRIGHT:

12

QUESTION:

Correct.
But suppose instead of having -- the

13

plainclothes people who are supposed to spend their time

14

pursuing big crime and not traffic violations had said,

15

well, we know what we're supposed to do, so they radioed

16

the regular patrol cops, and the same thing happened, is

17

that the whole of your position?

18

It's only that the plainclothes people -- they

19

suspect that there's some drug trafficking but they

20

haven't got probable cause, and they see that this person

21

is not the best driver in the world.

22

regular cops on the beat, and the regular cops can stop

23

that car.

25

MS. WRIGHT:

They radio the

Well, it would depend on what the

policy was as to uniformed, marked patrol cars.

There

would be a possibility that for the particular violations,

or in the particular circumstances, that would also be a

If the violation was a string -t

4

QUESTION:

Well, if the patrol police that I

5

have in mind, their job is to patrol traffic violations,

6

and that's all they do, so they stop people who are

speeding, who go through a red light, don't signal, that's

8

what they do all day, every day.

9

people simply radio such a car to do the work for them,

10

If the plainclothes

then your Fourth Amendment claim evaporates?
MS. WRIGHT:

11

Well, not if there is a policy that

12

would prohibit or would - - would prohibit the marked car

13

from making a stop, if, for example, the violation was a

14

string hanging from the rear view mirror and the police

15

department had a policy that said, you shall enforce the

16

regulation about objects hanging from the mirror only if

17

it is obstructing the view of the driver.

18

QUESTION:

But in your case I take it your

19

answer is that you would lose if what had happened here is

20

Soto radioed a regular patrol car and the regular patrol

21

car said, you weren't paying full attention to your

22

driving, you turned without signaling.

on that.

know, we just don't know the answer to that.

Supposing you get an officer, the

arresting officer on the stand, and you ask him, did the

The officer says no, the department does not have a

think that this Court can be sure that judges aren't going

11
12

Was this a

Well, you know, it's not just any

deviation in your view, but a gross deviation?
MS. WRIGHT:

13

I think that's right, because

14

police have to have discretion to work within a range of

15

conduct.

16

We're talking about a threshold that's just

17

really just a little above probable cause.

are not the things that the majority does.
I mean, it may well be reasonable not to stop

cars that just have broken taillights) and that may be the

4

general practice in the particular police department, but

5

that does not automatically make it unreasonable to stop a

6

car that has a broken taillight, and other departments may

7

make that their practice, so why does it become

8

unreasonable within the meaning of the Constitution simply

9

by being atypical?
MS. WRIGHT:

10

Well, I think what we're saying is

11

unreasonable is deviating from the policies that govern

your conduct.

MS. WRIGHT:

not have the ability under the Fourth Amendment to simply

reasonable.

MS. WRIGHT:

That's our position.
So why is stopping a car with a

broken taillight unreasonable?

12

MS. WRIGHT:

13

QUESTION:

I -Just because this department as a

14

general practice, though it's not a command, it has chosen

15

the other reasonable thing it doesn't render the other one

16

any less reasonable, does it?

17

MS. WRIGHT:

Well, for the same reason in Wells

18

a container opening can vary, and even taking it back

19

farther from the policy, in some jurisdictions it's legal

20

to turn right on red, in other jurisdictions it's not.

21

Stopping someone in one jurisdiction is reasonable under

22

the Fourth Amendment.

23

QUESTION:

Stopping them in another is not.
Yes, but in the one instance the

24

conduct is criminal, in the other instance it's not.

If, for example, the regulation did not contain

1

But Ms. Wright, does the United

2

States v. Caceres -- I think that's the name of the

3

case - - did that speak to this problem?

4

MS. WRIGHT:

No, it did not, because in Caceres

5

the Court was very clear that there was no reasonable

expectation of privacy, and in fact, no constitutional

7

right implicated at all, so I want to make clear I'm not

saying that any regulation that the police happen to have

is going to automatically result in suppression, only

10

those that bear on the reasonableness of the officer's

conduct.

QUESTION:

Well, what would be the significance

13

of this case, just taking your narrow view, if the chief

14

of the department comes in and says -- testifies well,

15

yes, it's true they violated that prohibition on

16

plainclothes officers doing that, but the only reason we

17

have that prohibition there is that when plainclothes

that that is saying we enacted this reg to protect the

personal security of motorists, which is at the heart of

security of the officer --

QUESTION:

9

I think it --- and perhaps to prevent placing

motorists in positions in which they might be inclined to

10

fight, but there was no fight here, and the officer didn't

11

get hurt, and you know, we're still going to dock his pay

12

a couple of hours for doing what he did, because we - - you

13

know, we don't want to run these risks, but it has

14

absolutely nothing to do with our view of when it is or is

15

not appropriate to arrest for offenses as offenses.

16
17
18

Isn't that the end of your case if that position
is accepted?
MS. WRIGHT:

Well,

I don't think so, because the

19

degree of intrusion is -- the manner it's made in is

20

relevant to what the degree of intrusion is and what the

21

citizen's privacy interest is, so you would still have an

22

enhanced citizen privacy interest in a case where an

judge will have to take into account the violation of the

QUESTION:

So there isn't really that narrow a

view.

even when there is a regulation, and the regulation at

QUESTION:

MS. WRIGHT:

There could -It's still a totality test.
I think there could theoretically

be a case where the regulation was violated, but the --

15

but it was -- but if a reasonable officer would have

16

violated the regulation because of the circumstances, then

that would pass our test.

It all comes down to a basic reasonableness

inquiry, and I just -- you know, on a balancing I would

20

just again point out that the kind of cases we're talking

about are the marginal cases, where the Government can't

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
It's our position that the traffic stop of

8

petitioners in this case was valid, and that the judgment

9

of the court of appeals should be affirmed.

10

Under the Fourth Amendment, a traffic stop that

11

is supported by probable cause, as it was in this case,

12

and that was undertaken in a reasonable manner and scope,

13

as it also was in this case, is valid.

14

conclusion follows regardless of the subjective

15

motivations of the officers who made the stop, the

16

internal regulations of the department that divide up

17

duties among different police officers, or the standard

18

police practices that the officers in a given jurisdiction

19

may happen to follow.

20

QUESTION:

In our view, that

Mr. Feldman, is there any other area

21

where there is essentially no control over the officers

that are authorized by the probable cause that he has.
The officer in this case did not have probable

says, no warrant shall issue except upon probable cause.
The point of the Fourth Amendment is to say,

there is a society's interest in enforcing the law, and

14

there is individual expectations of privacy, and at the

point where there's probable cause to believe that a law

MR. FELDMAN:

Why doesn't that make

I think because the reasonableness

It doesn't turn on the particular practices

Where a law is violated, society, per se, has an
interest in taking the appropriate enforcement action.
QUESTION:

So I suppose you would say that if it

14

was not a policeman who made this stop but one of the

17

it's just a local law that has assigned these duties to

policemen and other duties to garbage men.

MR. FELDMAN:

I think that in that case there

purports to make a traffic stop does so whether --

I would start off by saying there may not be a Fourth

and let me say that this Court has repeatedly said, in a

In this case, there wasn't any doubt about the

MR. FELDMAN:

No, because I think -- well, with

one caveat that I'll get to.
In general, enforcing the law under the Fourth

10

Amendment, giving a traffic ticket to somebody who's

11

violated the law is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

12

It's a nonarbitrary action.

13

which is, the person violated the traffic stop.

14

Now,

There's a reason for it,

if there's a -- if the system of laws in a

15

given jurisdiction shows there's some offense that's

16

defined in such an odd way that it really is just a way to

17

let the officers in that jurisdiction get around --

18

circumvent the requirements of the fourth Amendment and

19

get a drug dealer on less than probable cause, there

20

might be some kind of problem with a statute like that,

And I would add that in this case, what

3

petitioners --we mentioned that possibility, that that

4

would be one consequence or one way of looking at

5

petitioner's view in this case, and the answer seems to be

6

that no, there's a whole Fourth Amendment law also of what

7

kinds of rules a police department has to have, and those

8

rules have to be specific, have to be specific enough to

9

guide the discretion of the officers in making traffic

10

stops with respect to each kind of traffic offense, and I

11

would also think the same rules would have to apply in all

12

other areas where police exercise discretion.

13

If a police goes to an open air drug market and

14

is trying to do something about it, and sees a number of

15

people dealing drugs, and picks one of them, I think the

defendant under their rule -- I don't see why the

17

defendant couldn't say, well, why did you pick this person

18

and not somebody else, and you have to have a rule to

guide that.

But let me make - - I had one other point I did

16

want to raise with respect to Justice Breyer's question,

17

and that is, there are numerous cases where, for instance,

18

State constitutions have been interpreted to extend

19

greater protections than the Federal Fourth Amendment, and

20

therefore, where a police officer's action under State law

21

was illegal, even though under the Federal Constitution it

22

met the standards.

23

Well, this Court's never suggested that all of

24

those cases now are also violations of the Fourth

25

Amendment because they're violations of State law.

There's a -- the role,

1

the primary role of State

2

law, and perhaps not the exclusive one, but the primary

3

role of State law is in defining what the offenses are.

4

It's basically Federal standards under the Fourth

5

Amendment that determine whether - - that determine what

6

actions are reasonable, and it's our submission that it is

7

always reasonable to enforce the law - - to enforce the law

when you have probable cause to do so.
QUESTION:

Right.
-- and there would be different

standards applied to them.
I think again this case is instructive.

20

In the

21

suppression hearing in this case the officers were asked

22

questions about whether they made the stop because the

23

defendants were black. The officers denied that they had,

24

and I read the judge agreed that those denials were

25

credible.

So this is a case where they can't meet the

1

2

applicable equal protection standard, which is was this

3

action taken because of the race of the defendants, but

4

they want to say, well, no, we can't meet that standard,

5

but the Fourth Amendment imposes more stringent standards.

6

I think our answer to that is that the Fourth

7

Amendment is related to the individual's expectation of

8

privacy, and society's interest in enforcing the law, and

9

it's not a Fourth Amendment defense to say, because

10

society hasn't -- well, I violated the law, or there was

11

probable cause to believe that I did, but because somebody

12

else also violated the law, and it wasn't enforced against

13

that person, then therefore the evidence has to be

14

suppressed and it's an unreasonable search and seizure.

most situations would-have would yield the same thing as

MR. FELDMAN:

I thought it turns out that in

Well, I would point Your Honor's

5

attention to the Tenth Circuit's decision, for instance,

6

when it originally had adopted a, quote, would-have test

7

and moved to a could-have test.

8

And one of the reasons it did was, it reviewed

9

its cases and found that they were all over the lot when

10

courts tried to figure out whose practice is it who we're

11

supposed to look at when we look at standard police

12

practices?

unit, or the traffic enforcement unit, or who?

1

adopted that test, the judge starts looking into just the

2

subjective motivation of the officer -- why did you make

3

the stop?

4

Would you usually have made the stop?
I think that's what it generally degenerates

5

into, and, indeed, if you look at the formulation of the

6

would-have test, it's whether the reasonable officer would

7

have committed the traffic stop if he had been

8

motivated -- really, it's if he had been motivated by a

desire just to enforce the traffic laws.
And really, what it is is, it's just a not very

10
11

precise way of trying to get a subjective motivation.

12

long line of this Court's cases have held that subjective

13

motivation is not the touchstone in Fourth Amendment cases

14

in contexts similar to this, and so you can't go look

15

directly at it, but by using things like the rules in this

16

case as a proxy for that, you're both way overinclusive

17

and way underinclusive.

18

A

One problem is that the disobedience of a rule

19

of the sort that's involved here doesn't necessarily show

20

that the officer was operating under any kind of pretext

21

at all.

22

for instance, a jurisdiction may have a rule that officers

23

from one precinct can't stop cars in another precinct.

24

There may be all kinds of reasons why an officer would

25

violate that rule that have nothing to do with whether it

might be a pretext or not.
On the other hand, it's also dramatically

3

underinclusive, because there may be all kinds of cases

4

where officers don't violate rules, but where they decide

5

to enforce the law in a discretionary situation in one

case rather than another because of a hunch, or because of

7

a belief that by doing so they may deter some -- or

enforce, or find evidence of some -QUESTION:

9

Mr. Feldman, are you saying -- going

10

back to my really basic question, if one has the notion

11

that probable cause doesn't act as the barrier in this

12

area, that it does in others.

13

what we have, and you can't have any probable cause plus,

14

is that - MR. FELDMAN:

15

Your view is, well, that's

I would -- that is our view.

I

16

think that if the real objection here is that the traffic

17

laws are too hard for people to enforce, and therefore

18

people violate them and subject themselves to traffic

19

stops on a regular basis, then the remedy is with the

20

legislature, which has obviously not passed an appropriate

21

set of traffic laws if that were true.

It's not with the laws, it's with the

discretion of the police officer.

laws that are only rarely enforced.

There are many

But in fact, the traffic laws are a good example

5

of where selective enforcement, where enforcing them

6

occasionally, can have a great deterrent value.

7

If you are out on a highway and thinking of

8

violating the speed limit, you can know for a certainty

9

that the police officers don't have the manpower to stop

10

every one of the cars in the heavy traffic around you for

11

that violation, but what you don't know is whether they'll

12

stop you, and that possibility of exactly that kind of

13

occasional enforcement is in fact what the traffic laws

14

depend on.

15

In short, I think that petitioners' arguments

are primarily directed towards interests that are not

protected by the Fourth Amendment.

the Equal Protection Clause.

reason to adopt a more lenient standard under the Fourth

Amendment.

problem with the traffic laws and not -- because perhaps,

if that's so, they erect too high a standard for people to

obey.

3

But under the Fourth Amendment, where someone

is -- where someone -- where the police have probable

cause to believe that a statute is violated, or a

regulation is violated, then that is all that the Fourth

Amendment reasonableness inquiry requires.
