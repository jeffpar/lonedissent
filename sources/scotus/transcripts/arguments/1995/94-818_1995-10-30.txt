ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This is a case about simple fairness.

12

petitioners were compelled under the threat of civil and

13

criminal penalties to produce Agent Orange.

14

required to produce it according to precise specifications

15

commanded by the United States Government.

16

The

They were

The specifications ensured that dioxin would be

17

produced, which the United States knew, and the Government

18

also knew, and the court of appeals expressly found that

19

dioxin is an extremely hazardous substance.

20

knew none of these facts, and the United States knew them

21

and declined to divulge any of that information to the

22

United States -- or, excuse me, to the petitioner.

Petitioners

23

The Agent Orange that was produced by the

24

petitioners was done so in strict conformity to the

25

requirements of the United States, and the United States

then used it in unheard-of concentrations and exposed

thousands of American military and others to the risks

that arise from the dioxin.

Who cannot recover against the

QUESTION:

8

I mean, I really find your simple

9

fairness argument a little hard to take in this field.

10

mean, if there's anybody who's been done out of simple

11

fairness, it's the soldiers who were injured by this

12

thing, and they can't sue, so haven't we abandoned simple

13

fairness in this field?

QUESTION:

Should we be outraged that the

17

companies cannot pass on their liability, when the injured

18

parties themselves can't recover?

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, at least some portion of

20

the injured parties, of course, are taken care of by

21

veterans benefits programs, and that was a decision the

22

court made a long time ago with respect to the --

MR. PHILLIPS:

1

But the

as I understand the

2

theory, Justice Scalia, the quid pro quo for depriving

3

soldiers of the ability to go against the United States on

4

a tort theory was because they have other remedies, and

5

therefore the Court interpreted the Tort Claims Act not to

6

prove -- not to allow recovery.

7

That says nothing, though, about what ought to

8

be the relationship between the contractors and the United

9

States.

It seems to me quite clear that in defining that

10

relationship you have to look to the basic law of -- the

11

basic Federal common law, and what rules make sense there.
QUESTION:

12

Well, but it's been established for a

13

long time, Mr. Phillips, that he who deals with the

14

Government must turn square corners.

15

matter of equity, or something like that, it's a matter of

16

waiver of sovereign immunity, which is always strictly

17

construed.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

That is, it's not a

That's absolutely correct, Your

19

Honor, but there's no question in this case that there's

20

been a waiver of sovereign immunity.

outlines of what's within those contracts based on

1

principles this Court has long followed in terms of when

2

do you imply either indemnification agreements or

3

warranties based on the relationship between the parties

4

and the course of conduct between the parties.

5

The litigation in this particular case arose in

6

the wake of the initial settlements that were done by the

7

petitioners after they were sued by the -- those who had

8

been exposed to Agent Orange.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, with respect to that,

10

suppose this case had developed that Judge Pratt's

11

acceptance of the Government's contractor defense had

12

stuck, that there had been no change of district judges,

13

and he had entered that judgment, an appeal is taken, and

14

the companies are concerned about how the court of appeals

15

would resolve the Government contractor defense, so they

16

settle, precisely the terms that we have before us here.

17

They settle, and then they want to be reimbursed by the

18

Government for the cost of that settlement.

19

have a claim then?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Would they

Yes, Your Honor, I believe they

21

would have a claim.

They would unquestionably have a

22

claim under an implied indemnification theory, because it

23

is well settled under standard contract rules that if you

24

are indemnified against losses, that whatever losses arise

25

out of your course of conduct, assuming you're an innocent

1

party, are recoverable.
QUESTION:

2

But the loss in what I've described

3

to you is their decision, their uncertainty whether their

4

victory in the district court will prevail.

5

they don't want to take a chance on losing on appeal.

6

They've won in the district court, and yet you say that

7

the Government would be responsible under the contract.
MR. PHILLIPS:

8

That's --

Yes, Your Honor, under an implied

9

indemnification, which is either a variant of Spearin, or

0

a concept that you ought to take directly from Ryan

11

Stevedoring, where the nature of the relationship between

12

the parties demonstrates the kind of control that we're

3

talking about here, where you have compelled production,

4

you have precise specifications, and you have superior

5

knowledge.

6

an ordinary agency relationship you would immediately

7

assume indemnification, and that --

8

In that situation, you would ordinarily -- in

QUESTION:

But if the law is as a Government

9

contractor you have a complete defense to the tort action,

20

if that's what the law is, and then the manufacturers say,

21

yes, we urge that that was the law, it was accepted by the

22

court that that was the law, but we know those courts of

23

appeals are not reliable, so we're going to settle rather

24

than risk a reversal.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

As I understand the standard

1

rules of damages in an indemnification arrangement, the

2

fact that you had to expend moneys under any circumstances

3

is recoverable against the indemnitor.

4

Now, the question is, were the expenditures

5

reasonable?

6

squandered the assets of the indemnitor?

7

That is, has the indemnitee in some sense

Now, in your hypothetical, you could argue that

8

you're getting close to that, because in some situation

9

where you have an absolute slam dunk winner, it may be

10

that it would be inappropriate to settle.

11

our case, obviously, that's not what we faced.

12

have a guaranteed defense, and we weren't even being

13

supported by the United States as part of that process.

14

In the facts of
We didn't

The other portion of why an indemnification fits

15

neatly into this whole arrangement is that under standard

16

indemnification law the Government would, as an

17

indemnitor, be in a position to step into the shoes of the

18

indemnitee and therefore take over the defense, and if,

19

under those circumstances the Government wanted to ensure

20

1) that no settlements would go forward that they hadn't

21

approved of, they could exercise that right, but they

22

would have to take over the defense under those

23

circumstances.

24
25

But it seems to me that that's just standard
indemnification law as it would apply in the facts of this

particular case.
Now, with respect to breach of warranty, the

3

issue is a little less clear because the causation

4

requirement between a breach of warranty and the

5

particular damages is less clearly supported by the

6

position that you're entitled not only to recover anything

7

that you spend in consequence of a judgment, but that

8

you're also entitled to any settlement that you reasonably

9

enter into.

10

I think part of the reason why it's less clear

11

is because you don't have the indemnitor there to protect

12

itself, and under those circumstances, the courts take, I

13

think, a much harder look at whether or not the particular

14

damages were caused by the particular breach.

15

But here, we're dealing with a situation of

16

summary judgment, and we've not had an opportunity to

17

prove any of those relationships under the circumstances

18

in this case, and I'm confident that if we get back to the

19

claims court and we can demonstrate that the

20

specifications create both breaches of warranty and

21

breaches -- and that the -- and indemnification rights,

22

we'll be able to demonstrate under the traditional common

23

law rules that otherwise would apply precisely how the

24

damages ought to flow.

QUESTION:

compelled within the meaning of section 101, that you had

2

been compelled to produce this stuff?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, we did allege that we had

4

been compelled to produce under -- that there were orders

5

entered under section 707 of the defense production - -

6

QUESTION:

Why should we get into

7

indemnification when you had a defense under 707 by virtue

8

of the compulsion?

9
10

MR. PHILLIPS:
QUESTION:

Well, I mean we argued that we --

I mean, leaving aside whatever under

11

other circumstances might or might not be implied, doesn't

12

your allegation, if it is accepted, entitle you to a

13

defense and, therefore, why should we get into implying

14

indemnification that you don't need?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I've two answers to that.

16

First of all, we tried that defense and it didn't succeed.

17

We asserted in the Agent Orange litigation that we should

18

not be held liable, that we should be held harmless, as

19

the provisions seemed to indicate, and were told that it

20

only swept to the extent of the priority, and protections

21

against the priority of contracts, not from the rest of

22

the damages that would flow from performance of the

23

particular contract, so it may --

QUESTION:

Should you be excused from litigating

your position on that?

In other words, I don't know how

1

that will ultimately play out, but it seems to me you have

2

a strong argument.

3

issue as far as you can, and go to the convenience of

4

implying this indemnification so that you don't have to

5

bother to litigate your 707 position?

6

Should we excuse you for carrying that

MR. PHILLIPS:

Let me step back for a second in

7

terms of the sort of convenience of an indemnification,

8

because I think it's quite clear that that's not a matter

9

of convenience, it's a matter of the basic way of

10

interpreting the relationship between the parties under

11

these particular circumstances.

12

QUESTION:

Well, regardless of whether you call

13

it a convenience or not, if, to the extent that we are

14

going to do any implying here, or find an implication, why

15

should we find an implication when, on your own

16

allegations, you have a defense under 707 and, secondly,

17

why shouldn't you have to litigate that point?

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, we did litigate that point

19

up to the stage where we faced a $40 billion claim, and at

20

that point we blinked.

21

reasonable litigating judgment.

22

QUESTION:

I think that is a perfectly

It may be reasonable, but if we have

23

to choose between allowing you to blink at the expense of

24

1

theory had you pursued your defense, why should we prefer

2

you to the Government?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think the basic reason is

4

that the Government contractor whose entire enterprise is

5

controlled exclusively by the United States is an innocent

6

party to this entire proceeding, and as between an

7

innocent party and a not-innocent party in an implied

8

indemnification arrangement, it's Hornbook law that you

9

favor the innocent party.

10

QUESTION:

Well, but my difficulty is, your

11

argument seems to be proving, if I accept it, that you do

12

have a defense under 707 and the question is, who should

13

be, in effect, relieved from establishing this.

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, you know, the other side of

15

that is that when we argued this, the United States did

16

not come in and argue that we were entitled to protection

17

under section 707.

18

We've never been -- never got the benefit of the

19

Government supporting our particular position.

20

QUESTION:

They didn't view that as a defense.

Well, by the same token -- I don't

21

know the answer to this, but did you request the

22

Government to take part in the settlement?

23

request the Government to take a position?

24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, absolutely.

litigation, and failed to -QUESTION:

2

Well, I assume it follows from your

3

position that if you would -- if the Government would have

4

to contribute to your settlement you would also logically

5

have a claim against the Government if you didn't settle

6

and ultimately won.

7

Government for your attorney's fees, I suppose.
MR. PHILLIPS:

8

9

You'd have a claim against the

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe that

that's standard indemnification law.
QUESTION:

10

Well, my goodness, why is that?

I

11

mean, even people who are prosecuted criminally by the

12

Government and expend, you know, hundreds of thousands of

3

dollars to defend themselves and are ultimately found

4

innocent do not have a claim for indemnification against

5

the Government.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

I understand that, Justice

7

Scalia, but those people also don't have a contractual

8

relationship with the Federal Government.

9

QUESTION:

Yes, but whether it's reasonable to

20

imply that term in a contract with the Government surely

21

is colored by the fact that the Government doesn't even

22

pay off when it's prosecuted you wrongfully and you have

23

to expend hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend

24

yourself.

QUESTION:

1

Would the same Government who doesn't

2

pay you off in that situation likely have entered into an

3

implied contract with you to pay you off in what seems to

4

me the much less heinous situation that you're complaining

5

about?

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

QUESTION:

8

9

Well, it's difficult for me to --

This is a different Government you're

talking about, it seems to me.
MR. PHILLIPS:

But I mean, under ordinary

10

indemnification rules, Justice Scalia, the party who has

11

the power to compel, the party who has the power to

12

require compliance, and the party who has superior

13

knowledge and who allows the innocent contractor to engage

14

those kinds of expenses is entitled to be indemnified.

15

QUESTION:

But this party is the Government.

16

The average party is not a party who has sovereign

17

immunity, and what terms are implied in a contract with

18

the Government surely is -- ought to be colored by the

19

fact that the Government usually doesn't pay people off

20

for litigating.

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, let me suggest there are

22

two answers to that.

23

to me the same argument would have been -- could have been

24

made and probably was made in Spearin, and this Court

25

nevertheless implied warranties arising out of the course

First of all, essentially it seems

1

of conduct between the parties and, therefore, it seems to

2

me the same argument that was available there didn't

3

prevent the Government contractor from being protected.

4

QUESTION:

Between the parties have you got any

5

case in the Spearin line where, not the parties to the

6

immediate contract was involved, but where Spearin was

7

successfully invoked to recover money paid to third party

8

tort claimants, as here?

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

The two closest cases on point in

10

that regard are the Traveler's Insurance case out of the

11

Federal Circuit and the -- or is it -- I'm sorry, maybe

12

the Third Circuit, and the Williams-McWilliams case that

13

we cited.

14

applied Spearin directly and said there's no reason to

15

restrict Spearin and the basic implied warranties that are

16

embodied in Spearin to be cut off based simply on contract

17

performance when to do so is to expose these individuals

18

to greater harms, and basically --

Those are two court of appeals cases that

QUESTION:

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Were they third party tort claimants?
Yes.

In the one case a person

21

fell off of a tower that had been improperly built

22

according to Government specifications.

23

QUESTION:

Well, I don't read Spearin to say

24

that the law of implied warranties is -- or indemnity is

just going to be incorporated bag and baggage into every

MR. PHILLIPS:

QUESTION:

4

Well,

I don't read that --

Spearin is a fairly limited case on

its facts.
MR. PHILLIPS:

5

Well,

the one thing that Spearin

6

says, and I think this applies just as well with the

7

warranty as it does with the -- excuse me, with the

8

indemnification as with the warranty,

specifications.
That's the rule of law that Spearin announced

11
12

and,

interestingly,

it derived that rule from a series of

13

State court cases applying just general common law

14

principles,

15

responsible for defects that the Government foists upon

16

you.

that it's a settled rule that you are not held

And in this case,

17

to go back to the implied

warranty component of the case,

the defect that we were

19

dealing with was that a process that,

20

exactly what the Government commanded you to do under the

21

contract, would create dioxin, and everyone concedes that

dioxin is an extremely hazardous substance,

that dioxin that the United States then used to defoliate

the jungles of Vietnam and expose thousands of people to

injury.

Mr. Phillips, how does the Defense

Suppose you were ordered to produce

2

rendered superfluous by the provision of a contract remedy

3

here, and I think that's wrong on two counts.

4

First of all, I think consistent with the way

5

the Court analyzed the relationship between tort claims

6

and contract claims in Hatzlachh, in Hatzlachh you recall,

7

that was the case of an implied bailment agreement and

8

there was also a tort claims immunity, and there was also

9

the right to go against individual officers in order to

10

recover, and the Court said the availability of that

11

remedy in no way undermined the ability to get a contract

12

remedy and, therefore, under the facts of our case, the

13

availability of a "remedy Boyle" shouldn't in any way

14

deprive us of what otherwise would be a valid contract

15

remedy.

16

I think the logic of Hatzlachh applies here

17

directly, but I also think the importance of Boyle is that

18

it require -- is that if we're right, and we are entitled

19

to be indemnified under these circumstances, what that

means is that the Government's exposure to liability will

You may have a different theory that

general maxim of law that you have to deal in straight

Well, certainly not based upon any

MR. PHILLIPS:

QUESTION:

5

Oh, no --

-- that assumes that, in fact, this

was implicit in the agreement that they actually made.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, and the argument is that

7

under ordinary contract principles involving

indemnification, the underlying assumption is, is that the

9

party who has control will indemnify the party who is

10
11

innocent and is exposed to particular injury.
QUESTION:

But is that general rule, taking it

12

on its face, plausible in the very case that you are

13

arguing in which you are acting under compulsion?

14

The -- whatever plausibility that may have,

15

whatever justifiability that may have as a general rule, I

16

suppose is premised on the assumption that you have two

17

parties who are capable of deciding whether or not -- each

18

of them are capable of deciding whether or not to deal

19

with the other, and yet the very premise of your argument

20

1

nature of the relationship between the United States and

2

the petitioners should cause the Court to deviate from

3

what the ordinary rules of contract interpretation would

4

be.

5

And the three arguments the Government put

6

forward are that this will interfere with the tort claims

7

remedies, and this Court specifically rejected that in

8

Hatzlachh, saying, we look at contract as a contract

9

issue, we look at torts as a tort issue, is there a

10

contract situation here?

If that's all you're looking at,

11

then we look to ordinary principles of Federal common law

12

contract law, and those principles, it seems to me, say

3

that when you have compulsion and specifications and

4

superior knowledge that there ought to be indemnification.

5

And when the defect -- remember, we were

6

compelled to make a product that was inherently dangerous.

7

That's the defect.

There's a

That there's a this-case claim or there's a

principle that there is somehow thousands and thousands of

Government contracts, and sometimes in silences in those

millions of different Government contracts that arise in

millions of different circumstances courts will imply

QUESTION:

Did you

MR. PHILLIPS:

6

There was an allegation of a

7

taking in the Thompson complaint, but until we are not

compensated under the contract theories, there wouldn't be

a basis for saying we had not received just compensation

this.

matter of straightforward contract interpretation.
Second, it would be unnecessary, because even on

2

3

petitioner's view of the facts, because of the existence

4

of the Government contractor defense to tort liability,

5

there is no unfairness here in this kind of situation, and

6

third, it would be unwise, because it would permit exactly

7

the kind of cost - shifting to the Government that this

8

Court has held would impermissibly undermine the

9

Government's retention of immunity from suit for exercise

10

of its discretionary functions.
Now, we start out by saying what we all know

11

12

here.

13

warranty or indemnity running from the Government to the

14

suppliers.

15

look at those contracts is a warranty running from the

16

supplier to the Government that the product would be free

of defects in manufacture and design.

There's nothing written in these contracts about a

22

as the Court has pointed out, is an argument for a

do what was done here, an argument that the Government

Well --- I think, the claim.
-- and do you -- does any logical

reason occur to you why they wouldn't prevail on the

14

MR. DuMONT:

I have two answers.

1) I think it

15

would be a much better claim than the claim they have

raised here.

2) The context of this, of course, is requiring

citizens to do things in time of war that help the

Government in prosecuting its war effort.

MR. DuMONT:

Well, I'm not sure I can sort them

out, but let me try to direct my answer to one of them,

12

which is the notion of wouldn't it be reasonable to

interpret the contract in light of all the surrounding

circumstances.

Well, I think our answer to that is, of course

that is say, look, there's a difference between breach of

2

contract in which the officer had the authority to enter

3

into the contract, and we're talking about breach damages

4

which are relatively reasonably bounded by what the

5

original contract was about, what the original

6

appropriation was about and so on.

7

between that and an open-ended sort of indemnity

provision.

There's a difference

9

That's the line the Federal Circuit has drawn,

10

which, of course, is the court that is primarily charged

11

in the claims court, the courts that are primarily charged

12

with making sense out of this area.

3

Now, the other thing I would point out, when the

4

Government -- when Congress decides it wants to give

5

indemnities, it does so specifically, and with great care:

6

50 U.S. Code section

7

exactly the kind of situations that we're talking about

8

here with defense contracts, gives the Secretary of

9

Defense, the President, broad authority to enter into

43

provides for indemnities in

20

contracts without regard to normal terms like the Anti-

21

Deficiency Act, but it requires procedures.

Now, petitioners never asked for it.

Those

procedures weren't complied with.

MR. DuMONT:

QUESTION:

5

MR. DuMONT:

6

7

What provision is that you're relying

That's 50 U.S. Code section 1431.
Thank you.
And it's discussed at some length

in our brief at page 40, footnote 23.
There is another provision just -- I could go

8

on, but there's another provision -- this one is not cited

9

in our brief -- 10 U.S. Code section 2354, which happens

10

11

to have to do with military R&D contracts.
If you look at that one, you'll see again a kind

12

of careful structure.

13

talks like an indemnity, and Congress put it there

14

specifically.

15
16
17

It looks like an indemnity, it

Now, the Government does not impliedly agree to
indemnify people for open-ended liabilities.
Now, another reason why, and this, I think, goes

18

back to your point about, when we're interpreting a

19

contract with the Government we think about what the

20

Government might have had in mind, and in this case the

21

Government would have had in mind that it is immune from

22

tort liability for injuries that allegedly arise from the

23

exercise of its discretionary functions.

24
25

Now, the Court made it very clear in Boyle that
the discretionary function exemption in tort law covers

design decisions for military equipment.

2

Now, we're not saying, under Hatzlachh, that

3

that precludes the Court from reading this contract to

4

include an indemnity or warranty provision, but it

5

strongly suggests to us that the Government would not have

6

wanted to enter in, sub silentio, to a warranty provision

7

that would have completely vitiated that important

8

immunity.

9

QUESTION:

But I take it that their basic point,

10

in the lower courts, was yes, yes, that's quite right, but

11

you see, here we are trying to look at an implied, is

12

there a term to reimburse us implied in fact, and we argue

13

the Government had superior knowledge as to the danger.

14

We look at indemnity contracts and tell you that

15

indemnitors normally are liable when they won't take over

16

a lawsuit and then they force the other person to go and

17

litigate it, though they could come in and run it the way

18

they think it should be run.

19

Look at that policy, and look at the policy of

20

707, and when you put all those things together, you will

21

see there's some kind of implied term here.

22

I'm looking at it most favorably to them, and

23

what I don't see in the lower courts is a court, like the

24

Fed Circuit, that ever passed on that, and I don't see the

25

facts in the record that would permit them to pass on it,

1

and that's why I'm back to thinking -- indeed, what the

2

Fed Circuit said is it, in footnote 8 it hinted that

3

footnote -- both footnote 8 and the other thing and 707

4

discussion seemed to turn on errors of law that you seem

5

ready to admit are errors of law.

6

That is, the -- this problem of the causation,

7

and the problem of 707 being limited to just

8

prioritization of contract, and I'm not positive you admit

9

that, but you see, what I'm trying to get at is, don't we

10

have to send this whole thing back if we think those are

11

errors of law?

12

MR. DuMONT:

13

Now, I do want to be clear that I don't believe

14

No, you don't.

we've conceded either of the points that you --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. DuMONT:

All right.
-- that you mentioned.

I mean, our

17

position is that although an argument under 707 raised as

18

a shield would certainly be a vastly stronger argument

19

than the one they've raised here, it was -- it's been

20

rejected by the three courts that have considered it, and

21

we consider that to be the right answer.

22

QUESTION:

I don't mean it's a shield.

They're

23

looking to the policy in order to decide whether, among

24

other reasons, there is an implied-in-fact --

trying to do here.
Now, I must say I agree with the implication of

3

a question I believe was from Justice Souter, which is

4

that, if anything, the existence of that shield provision

5

in the Defense Production Act shows that Congress thought

6

about this issue, and they resolved it by giving

7

contractors a shield of whatever scope it turns out to be

8

and there is, therefore, even less reason to think they

9

authorized their contracting officers to enter into broad

10

indemnities that would just simply get rid of the reason

11

for having that shield provision in the first place.

12

should they bother to invoke that when they've got an

3
4

Why

indemnity from the Government?
Now, to your other point, petitioner's counsel

5

keeps talking about the law of indemnity as though it were

6

perfectly clear that if this were a contract between

17

private parties, an indemnity would be implied.

I'm not

8

at all sure that that is correct, or that they have

9

established that.

20

But in any event, if you look at any of the

21

circumstances where the Government provides warranties and

22

there's an executive order after 50 U.S. Code

23

I mentioned before, that goes into great detail about how

24

to do indemnities.

25

they look like an indemnity clause in a sophisticated

indemnity, and then they give the indemnitor all sorts of

rights to participate in the defense, or control of the

7

Now, of course, there wasn't anything like that

Now, they say they asked us to participate in

8

the settlement.

That's fine they asked us to do that, but

9

we had no liability.

That was our position from the

10

beginning, that we were not liable, and we effectively

11

stood apart from the rest of that litigation until it was

12

settled.

3

We did not participate in the settlement because

4

we thought we had no liability.

5

and I don't know why it should be implied or inferred from

6

that that we had made some sort of contractual commitment

to pay them for whatever they decided to settle for.

unfairness, and I believe that is not an argument that is

of, and their -- our submission is that if you look at the

way Government contracts have always been interpreted, the

to do things, then we are very, very far away from

If the Government is being perfidious, the last

Now, we've talked about why it's unreasonable as

a regular contract matter to imply this, and you've talked

petitioners allege it to be with a defense to tort

Our general position is that 707 --

Now, I think that points out -- I'm sorry.

2

Well, I think that points out why -- the fundamental

3

difference between the Government contractor defense and

4

petitioner's theory as a sensible way of resolving this

5

problem, because the Government contractor defense in

6

those circumstances prevents liability on the part of the

7

manufacturer if it's really something that should have

8

been the Government's responsibility, but it also saves to

9

the Government its immunity from that suit, so neither

10

party is liable and a loss lies where it falls, which is

11

the result of the tort immunity.

12

Now, under petitioner's theory, on the contrary,

13

what you get is a direct pass-through.

14

recover from the manufacturer, and the manufacturer then

15

recovers from the Government, so the Government -- so the

16

manufacturer is now protected, but the public policy

17

underpinnings for the Government contractor defense have

18

now been vitiated, because the Government ends up paying

19

the substantive liability, and as Justice Scalia pointed

20

out, under any circumstances the attorney's fees for

21

defense of the tort action, so --

I guess I wasn't paying attention a

is narrower than the scope of the compulsion under 101,

defense, would you please remind me of how that played

2

out?

3

there were some proceedings before Judge Weinstein where I

4

understand the Government didn't simply stand aside, but

5

it argued affirmatively against the Government contractor

6

defense.

7

Judge Pratt said, I accept that defense, and then

MR. DuMONT:

It's important to understand the

8

sequence here.

Judge Pratt rendered summary judgment.

9

withheld the final judgment in order to give the

10

defendants the benefit of certifying the class before he

11

entered it.

12

He

As it turned out, he then relinquished control

13

of the case.

Judge Weinstein took over, and he simply

14

revoked the prior summary judgment.

\
15

Now, as far as I understand it, he did not

16

question the availability of the defense, he questioned

17

whether it could be established without trial, so he

18

revoked the summary judgment.

19
20
21

Now, he then -- eventually the parties settled.
That case went away.
Now, he -- Judge Weinstein at the same time, you

22

have to understand, had revoked the summary judgment that

23

had been granted to the Government on grounds of Feres and

24

the discretionary function exception, so he was bringing

25

everyone back in and saying, I'm going to send you to

trial and we're going to find out what happened here, and

2

then we'll sort out the legal issues after the trial.

s
3

Now, after the settlement, and after that

4

litigation was effectively over, there was opt-out

5

litigation of the people who opted out of the class, and

6

they brought -- their proceedings were continuing, and

7

those proceedings, at the behest of the manufacturers,

8

including Thompson and Hercules, Judge Weinstein also went

9

back on his ruling on the third party liability claim as

10

to certain people who were not servicemen but were

11

relatives of servicemen.

12

So in that context, we filed a motion saying,

13

listen, if you are talking about a group of plaintiffs,

14

and you're telling us that the Government is not immune as

15

a matter of tort law, then there's no reason for the

16

Government contractor defense.

And so if you're going to do that to us, then it

seems like you shouldn't have the Government contractor

That's section 1 of our submission.

Now, section 2 of our submission is several

22

reasons -- and it's in the Joint Appendix.

to you -- several reasons why there might be factual

1

Judge Pratt, Judge Weinstein, or the Second Circuit, ever

2

suggested that there was doubt about the availability of a

3

Government contractor defense if you established the

4

factual prerequisites for its application, and I think

5

that's quite important.
Just to sum up, again, we think that it's

6

7

unreasonable as a matter of contract law to think that the

8

Government would have agreed to this kind of indemnity.

9

It is unnecessary if a Feres justification is required

10

because of the existence of the Government contractor

11

defense and perhaps Section 707, and it would be quite

12

unwise, because it would gut the Government's immunities

3

in a way that this Court specifically rejected in

4

interpreting the Government contractor defense itself.

2

and essentially did not defend the court of appeal's

3

interpretation of the Defense Production Act.

4

On that basis alone, you ought to vacate and

5

send it back to allow us an opportunity to demonstrate the

6

precise contours and the nature of the relationship

7

between the indemnification and breach of warranty claims

8

that we think this Court has already acknowledged and

9

recognized can be readily implied in the ordinary

10

contracts, and that ought to be applied -QUESTION:

11

12

Mr. Phillips, that argument, if this

were a court of error correction, if this were a court of

3

appeals and errors, that might be a very sympathetic

4

argument, but in terms of the question on which we granted

5

certiorari, the law that we are making not for this

peculiar case, but for the class of cases, how does

7

that --

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Ginsburg, I would answer

that by reference to Justice Breyer's question, when he

20

said that people who deal in Government contracts, and I'm

21

not one of them, look at things like Spearin claims and

22

Helene Curtis claims and other claims, and the truth is,

23

what this Court ought to hold in the context of this case

24

is that this is a Hercules and Thompson claim, where you

25

have compulsion, and specifications, and superior

just to imply within the contours of that contract that

3

there will be an indemnification.

4

QUESTION:

It is perfectly fair and

I take it it isn't that you're asking

5

that you'd like us to hold that, but I take it that

6

technically you'd say the question is whether the Fed

7

Circuit should have an opportunity to ask the district

8

court to find the facts so that one can decide whether or

9

not that should be so.
MR. PHILLIPS:

10

I think, though, the Court could

11

hold that if the facts are as I've described them to

MR. PHILLIPS:

All right.
-- I understand that, but the

18

rule of law ought to be one in which we have an

19

opportunity to recover, and that the remedy that the

20

Government offers us, the Government contract defense as

21

our sole opportunity to protect ourselves, was revealed as

22

plainly in this case as it can be revealed is inadequate.

23

There are gaps.

It doesn't cover everything,

24

25

controlling party and an indemnification arrangement on a

Government contract or any other contract, the appropriate

2

course is to find that the innocent party is indemnified

3

and to hold the Government liable.

Under that theory of law, which I think applies

here, I'd ask the Court to reverse and send it back for

further proceedings.
