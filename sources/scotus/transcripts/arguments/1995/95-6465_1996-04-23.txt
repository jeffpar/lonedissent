ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN M. STATSINGER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STATSINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
By requiring jury trials in all criminal

10
11

prosecutions, the Framers made a lasting statement about

12

the structure of Government and the balance of political

13

power.

14

power to convict does not belong to the State, it belongs

15

to the people themselves.

16

In cases where the threat to liberty is dire, the

The Framers regarded the jury trial as such a

17

potent instrument against Government oppression that they

18

included the guarantee in the Constitution not once, but

19

twice.

20

These bedrock political values, the plain

21

language of the Sixth Amendment guarantee, and this

Court's decisions construing the Sixth Amendment, all

point toward a single conclusion.

split up into two separate prosecutions.

But wouldn't be if the counts were

MR. STATSINGER:

That is correct, Justice

Ginburg -- Ginsburg.
QUESTION:

5

So if we accept your view in order to

6

make anything but sort of a farcical rule we would have

7

to, I suppose, have a rule of compulsory joinder.
MR. STATSINGER:

9

respect, Justice Souter.

I disagree with that, with all
The reason is that in the first

10

place it strikes us as very unlikely that the Government

11

would seek to sever counts in order to circumvent this

12

rule.

13

Government derives a benefit from joining counts, and has

14

every incentive to join them and not to sever them.

15

The reason is that -- for that is that the

QUESTION:

Well, it may, it may not.

I mean, it

16

may get a benefit if the evidence, in fact, is common to

17

all of the counts, or all of the separate indictments, but

18

if the Government really wants somebody to do the maximum

19

amount of hard time, I suppose even under the guidelines

20

there's some reason to believe the total will be greater

21

if they're tried separately.

22

So the Government might be under conflicting

23

motivations and it might in some cases decide to sever,

24

and I would suppose if it does, unless we have a

25

compulsory joinder rule, then the rule that you argue for

1

is not going to be of any practical effect.
MR. STATSINGER:

2

I continue to disagree with

3

that view.

4

joining counts would outweigh those concerns, because the

5

Government would get not only the administrative

6

convenience of a single proceeding, but it also does

7

derive a tactical advantage from joining the counts in the

8

first place.

9

I think that the value to the prosecution of

The finder of fact gets to hear evidence that

10

the defendant is, in essence, a worse defendant, because

11

he or she has committed more than one offense, and there's

12

also the possibility of some sort of spillover that might

13

bolster some of the weaker counts.

14

QUESTION:

You, at any rate, are not arguing for

15

a compulsory joinder rule along with your view of the jury

16

trial requirement.

17

MR. STATSINGER:

I am not, Mr. Chief Justice.

18

To the extent necessary, we believe that the Due Process

19

Clause might give sufficient protection to protect against

20

that kind of abuse.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Statsinger, how does your -- how

22

does the rule you're urging square with the proposition

23

that you cannot avoid jury trial requirement by committing

24

that you will not ask for a sentence of more than 6

25

months?

I mean, can the prosecution, by making that

1

commitment and the judge, by saying at the outset, I -- it

2

is understood that whatever -- eve if the defendant is

3

found guilty he will not be sentenced by more than

4

6 months, can you eliminate the jury trial by doing just

5

that?

6

MR. STATSINGER:

7

QUESTION:

No, you cannot, Justice Souter.

Now, why would that be consistent

8

with the rule that you're urging here?

9

what it means is, by subtracting you can't avoid the jury

trial.

12

Why, by adding, should you require it?

I

1

propositions are not in conflict, and the reason is

2

because the way this Court has defined criminal

3

seriousness for jury trial purposes is by looking at the

4

authorized penalty regardless of whether it's the

5

authorized penalty for a single serious offense or for the

6

aggregate authorized penalty of petty offenses.

7

Once a case is serious, it is serious in the

8

same away, regardless of whether it is serious by virtue

9

of aggregation or serious because of the authorized

10

penalty on a single -QUESTION:

11

Well, so then it's not just the power

12

of the judge that you're concerned with, it's the

13

dignitary or the interest or the stigma that's attached to

14

the crime.
MR. STATSINGER:

15

That is a component of this as

16

well.

17

result, in order to extinguish the jury trial, the

18

defendant is still left with the possibility of the

19

conviction on more than one count, which itself carries

20

not only a stigma but other collateral consequences, and

21

indeed, it appears that the core of the jury-trial right

22

was protection against the conviction power, and that

23

there was less concern per se about the sentencing power.

2

have focused primarily on the potential for incarceration.
MR. STATSINGER:

That is true, Mr. Chief

3

Justice, but I think the important distinction between the

4

Court's prior cases and this case was that in each of

5

those cases the defendant was only being tried on a single

6

count, so in a sense the question never arose in those

7

cases, but it is our position that --

10

QUESTION:

So you say there's a lot worse stigma

being convicted of two counts than one?
MR. STATSINGER:

It may not be a lot, Mr. Chief

11

Justice, but I believe that there is some, and I -- again,

12

I -- this is not our exclusive justification for this.

13

believe there are other justifications for allowing this.

QUESTION:

We

That has to be your principal

15

justification if the judge says, or the prosecution says

16

at the outset that 6 months is the maximum.

17

taken out of play, then what are you left with, other than

18

this stigma argument?

19

MR. STATSINGER:

If that's

Well, we are left with the

20

stigma, and we are left with the possibility of an unfair

21

or an unjust conviction in the first place.

22

The reason why this Court has, and the Framers

23

have always preferred jury trial is because they were

24

viewed as the fairest mechanism for adjudicating the facts

25

in a criminal case, and a defendant who comes before a

1

court could reasonably view a jury trial, even today, as

2

being a fairer proceeding than a bench trial.

3

QUESTION:

Well, but if that's logical, why did

4

the Court ever say that a jury trial doesn't carry over to

5

misdemeanors?

6

misdemeanor trial where your maximum sentence is 3 months?

7

I mean, should you have an unfair

MR. STATSINGER:

The Court -- the Court did that

8

for two reasons.

It looked back at common law history and

9

found that there was a historical basis for saying that a

10

trial on a single petty offense could be tried without a

11

jury.

12

There also appears to be, particularly in

3

Duncan, some concern about the administrative convenience,

4

the balance between administrative convenience and the

5

possible threat to a defendant, but again, that balance

6

was struck in cases where the defendant was only being

7

tried on a single count, and that balance has been struck

8

only in cases where the defendant's sentencing

9

consequences are 6 months or less.

20

And in this case the balance is tipped in the

21

other direction because the sentencing consequences --

22

regardless of the promise, the sentencing consequences at

23

the beginning are -- were well in excess of 6 months.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, why do you say regardless of

the promise?

1

MR. STATSINGER:

I say that because the relevant

2

measure of criminal seriousness has always been what is

3

authorized rather than what is actually imposed.

4

QUESTION:

Well, so you say the sentencing

5

consequences, and it is quite an abstract thing.

6

doesn't have anything to do with the maximum sentence

7

which this particular defendant might face.

8

9

MR. STATSINGER:

It

That is correct, Your Honor.

Perhaps I used the term injudiciously.

The Court has

10

always focused more on the authorized sentence rather than

11

the likely or possible sentence, or, indeed, even the

12

actual sentence imposed in a particular case.

13

QUESTION:

And the reason for that was, as we've

14

said in recent cases, the judiciary should not substitute

15

its judgment as to seriousness for that of a legislature,

16

which is far better equipped to perform the task.

17

Now, when you string together a bunch of

18

offenses, each of which the legislature has found to be

19

not serious because the sentence is under 6 months, how

20

does that create a new legislative judgment that this case

21

is now serious?

22

legislative judgment remains the same, no matter how many

23

legislated crimes you string together.

24
25

It doesn't.

MR. STATSINGER:

It seems to me the

Justice Scalia, the legislative

judgment that we are discussing is embodied in section

1

3584(a), which authorizes consecutive sentences on

2

multiple counts.

3

a substantive authority on the Court to impose --

It is our view that that statute confers

4

QUESTION:

I see.

5

MR. STATSINGER:

I see.
-- consecutive sentences, and

6

that it reflects a judgment that the commission of

7

multiple offenses is a more serious transgression than the

8

commission of a single offense.
Indeed, it is the same judgment that goes into

9
10

authorizing a -- the particular penalty for any single

11

offense.

12

it is setting the maximum penalty for the worst possible

13

instance of that offense.

14

In either case, what the legislature is doing is

The maximum penalty for a single offense

15

represents the authorized consequences in the worst

16

possible case.

17

multiple offenses authorizes a particular sentence for the

18

worst possible instance of that combination of offenses.

19

Similarly, the authorized sentence for

So it is our view that the judgment embodied in

20

that statute is identical to the judgment that the Court

21

has always looked to, or at least since Duncan has always

22

looked to in determining criminal seriousness.

23

I believe that this is also consistent with the

24

plain language of the Sixth Amendment itself.

25

the Government takes the view that the jury-trial right is

Although

1

what they call offense-specific, or attaches only to

2

categories of offenses, that is not borne out by the

3

language of the Sixth Amendment, which says that the right

4

attaches in all criminal prosecutions.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Statsinger, I have a question --

6

I don't know whether it goes to standing, but this

7

sentence here was probation, right?

who got probation, no jail time, want to risk a new trial

before a jury when the end result of that could be jail

Why would a defendant

time?
MR. STATSINGER:

11

I don't think it is a standing

12

question.

13

that we view the likelihood of an increased sentence,

14

assuming he were convicted on retrial, as very slim, and

15

the North Carolina v. Pierce line of cases we think

16

protects Mr. Lewis from a more severe sentence should the

17

case be retried and should the retrial end in a

18

conviction.

19

I think that the answer to that, Your Honor, is

But the jury-trial right has always been viewed

20

as a structural right, or an absolute right, that is not

21

contingent or affected by the sentence actually imposed.

22

Certainly the defendant in Duncan, who received 60 days

23

when he was facing 2 years, must have made that same

24

calculus, and made the decision that the core importance

Perhaps you'll argue that this is

quite irrelevant either way, but I have no sense of how

11

burdensome this rule that you propose would be on all of

12

the State courts.

13

magistrates' courts, municipal courts all over the

Prosecutors like to have multiple charges, misdemeanor

varieties and so forth, but it seems to me this might be a

QUESTION:

But that doesn't go to the State

court situation that Justice Kennedy was asking about.

5

MR. STATSINGER:

That is correct, Mr. Chief

6

Justice, but I have looked at that as well.

One of my

7

amici has indicated that their research indicates that at

8

least 30 States already grant, either by statute or State

9

constitution, a jury-trial right that is broader than what

10

the Sixth Amendment requires.

11

that the number is more like 34, so we are, in fact,

12

talking about a very small number of States to begin with.

QUESTION:

My own research indicates

We're talking about 17 or 20, I

guess.

MR. STATSINGER:

Roughly 17 or 20, Mr. Chief

Justice.

17

I might add that I think the real instance where

18

that burden was looked at and rejected was in Duncan, when

the court applied the jury-trial right to the States in

the first place.

the appropriate one, and that there certainly has --

MR. STATSINGER:

This is just an

question, Mr. Chief Justice, but I believe that the answer

to the question is that it will not have a tremendous

MR. STATSINGER:

Even if it is, Justice Kennedy,

the possible consequences to a defendant who has a large

7

certainly with respect to what the Sixth Amendment really

means and the core values that it contains, a society in

which large numbers of defendants are subject to many

I do agree with that, and

again,

view on that, and I think that the record in this case

actually serves as a good illustration of the dangers of

1

prosecution was serious enough to trigger the jury-trial

2

right in the first place.

3

In that case, the Court concluded that a trial

4

on joint petty counts, in that case contempt counts, was a

5

serious one when the aggregate penalty, petty penalties

6

exceeded 39 months, and I don't think that there can be a

7

meaningful distinction between Codispoti and what was

8

happening here in terms of the preliminary question of
whether the case was serious.

10
11
12

It is true that the Codispoti decision did not
involve a pretrial sentencing stipulation -QUESTION:

Well, except that if our guideline is

13

for determining seriousness what the legislature

14

determines is serious, then Codispoti has no relevance for

15

us, because the legislature hadn't made that

16

determination.

17

MR. STATSINGER:

It does, Justice O'Connor,

18

because the Court has repeatedly said that the actual

1

sentencing decision in a contempt case represents the

20

identical judgment to the legislative judgment in- a

21

statutory offense case, so it is our view that in a sense

22

the Court has turned to the sentence imposed, actually

23

imposed in contempt cases as a substitute for the

24

legislator's judgment, but the court has always viewed

25

them as equivalents.

QUESTION:

1

Add that in Codispoti each individual

2

sentence was for less than 6 months, so when you combine

3

that with Blanton, you have a series of 6 months offenses.

4

That's your argument, isn't it?

QUESTION:

ahead.

Yes, Your Honor.

All right, so that's -- and -- go

I just wanted to see that that was --

8

MR. STATSINGER:

Oh, yes.

9

Our position is that a series of six amendments,

10

when -- 6-month counts, when joined, triggers a jury

11

trial.

12

because if each individual trial on a single petty offense

13

falls outside of the Sixth Amendment, then any individual

14

one does.

When they are tried separately, they do not,

15

Moving back to the pretrial sentencing

16

stipulation again, there is a secondary reason besides the

17

policy behind the Sixth Amendment that I think indicates

18

that such a stipulation procedure should not be authorized

19

in this case, and the reason is that it is inconsistent

20

with this Court's decisions that have refused to hold that

21

the sentence actually imposed can deprive someone of a

22

jury trial.

23

The relevant question is, and always has been,

24

whether a serious sentence was authorized by the

25

legislature, and the Court has consistently held that a

judge cannot trump that view of seriousness, and in fact

2

the Court has had many opportunities to look at this rule

3

and has never changed it.

4

QUESTION:

Maybe I should ask, because the thing

5

that I find difficult with Codispoti is, it seems to me

6

that Codispoti's -- you have cases that stand for the

7

proposition if you have more than a major -- minor

8

offense, you have to have a jury, all right, and here we

9

have only minor offenses.
Codispoti seems to stand for the proposition

10
11

that if you add them all up and they add to more than

12

6 months, you have to have a jury, right?

13

MR. STATSINGER:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

All right, so why isn't the obvious

15

answer to that here, well, the Constitution forbids your

16

client from being punished by more than 6 months.

End of case.
MR. STATSINGER:

Well, the Court -- certainly

19

the Court has never held that in the context of statutory

20

offenses, even though it has in the context of contempt

21

cases, and I think one problem with that is that it would

22

have the, in a sense, perverse result of granting a

23

broader Sixth Amendment right to contempt cases than for

24

statutory offense cases.

25

Why?

MR. STATSINGER:

1

Because the contempt cases

where the counts were -- the contempt cases where the

3

counts were stacked would always trigger a jury-trial

4

right unless there was such a promise.
QUESTION:

5

There need be no promise.

The

6

Constitution forbids a person tried for a series of minor

7

offenses, each of which has a maximum, from going to

prison for more than 6 months.
If they try to put him in for more than 6

months, he's released on habeas.
MR. STATSINGER:

11
12

I see your point, Justice

Breyer.

13

Again, we continue to believe that the

14

constitutional provision at issue here has never operated,

15

and has -- has never operated on -- by looking at or

16

considering the sentence actually imposed or to be

3

you get a jury trial if you're going to be put away for

4

more than 6 months.

5

QUESTION:

That's where you start, and in addition to that,

Codispoti.
I suppose your response is that the

6

Constitution says you get a jury trial if it's a criminal

7

prosecution.
MR. STATSINGER:

8

9

That is an excellent response

to that.

10

(Laughter.)

11

I may do that.

And it was a response to that

12

that was developed by considerably wiser individuals than

13

me who were very, very concerned not only with the

14

sentencing consequences but with the power to convict.

15

And that rule, while providing a measure of

16

security to defendants, does not change the core value,

17

the possibility of the abuse of State power, the

18

possibility of a conviction that is itself unfair or

L9

unjust because the common sense and -- the common sense

20

community values and the impartiality of the jury wasn't

21

brought into the case in the first place.

22

And I think it's relevant to note at this point

23

that, although the Court has not decided a very large

24

number of cases in this area, it has approved of bench

25

trials either implicitly or explicitly in a number of

them, but a significant number of those cases, even though

2

the Court approved of the bench trial, the Court reversed

3

because the proceeding itself was unfair for some other

reason.
And I think that in a sense speaks to this

particular concern, that the Court has always viewed jury

trials as better, a fairer way of adjudicating the facts

8

in criminal cases, and -QUESTION:

9

Well, that might be persuasive if the

10

reason bench trials were reversed here was because there

11

was no evidence to support the judgment conviction, but I

12

take it that's not what you're saying.

13

I mean, a judge presides over a jury trial just

14

as well as a bench trial and can make all sorts of errors

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MS. PILLARD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

7

In our view, any case involving only offenses

8

that Congress has defined as petty may be tried without a

9

jury.

Petitioner has no right to a trial by jury because

10

both of the offenses in this case were defined by Congress

11

as petty.

12

Petitioner acknowledges that the United States

13

could have charged him with the same offenses in two

14

separate informations and tried him without a jury in two

15

separate trials.

16

separate seriatim trials before the same judge on the same

17

day, and he could have been sentenced to a total of a year

18

in prison in the two proceedings.

19

he would have had no jury right in that situation.

In fact, he could have been tried in

In petitioner's view,

20

The petty character of obstruction of the mails

21

is unchanged by the prosecutor's decision in this case to

22

try the two counts together.

Of course, it's true that in the

24

examples you give, those would have been separate

We believe there's no basis to

petitioner's textual argument that the constitutional

reference to criminal prosecutions means that the

11

The petty offense exclusion has already made

clear that criminal prosecutions exclude prosecutions of

crimes, and this Court's cases have made clear that

20

crimes, as specified in Article III, and the criminal

21

prosecutions as specified in the Sixth Amendment, are

22

limited to serious crimes.

23

Therefore, petitioner's argument reduces to

24

arguing that serious offense prosecutions are covered by

the Sixth Amendment.

It doesn't support the weight he

Under the petitioner's theory, the criminal

3

prosecution theory also makes no sense, because under his

4

theory an individual charged with two petty crimes that

arising, one a couple of months later than the other,

might happen to go to trial separately, that individual

I mean, prosecutors don't

MS. PILLARD:

-- are too busy to do
to me.

The basic point, though, is that

4

you look not to the prosecutor's decision under Rule 8

5

whether to join or not to join, but the established

6

methodology for determining which offenses are serious is

7

to look to the legislative assessment of the seriousness

of the offense or the offenses, and the prosecutor's

decision whether or not to join is not a legislative

assessment.

But can you not say the legislature

MS. PILLARD:

No, and that follows on the

response that petitioner's counsel gave to Justice Scalia.

8

Petitioner's counsel relies on section 3584, which

authorizes consecutive sentencing.

However, that provision is not a prosecution-

That provision applies equally to the

is that because that legislative authorization, 3584,

MS. PILLARD:

That's precisely right, it doesn't

petitioner concedes, are not subject to the jury right,

And, of course, they're not subject

to it because they're not one prosecution within the

meaning of the Sixth Amendment.

MS. PILLARD:

Moreover, I would point to this

10

Court's language in Blanton v. Las Vegas, in which the

11

Court pointed to the relevant legislative determination of

seriousness as the determination that the legislature

includes within the definition of the crime itself that in

it's looking at that offense as the unit and setting the

Ms. Pillard --

QUESTION:

Well --go ahead.

6

QUESTION:

Thinking of an analogy to the Seventh

That's right.

7

Amendment on the civil side, there's a whole string of

8

cases in this Court that said the old idea that the judge

9

could set the order of trial by putting the equitable

10

claim before the legal, that didn't fly because the jury-

11

trial right was so basic that whenever there was a choice

2

the legal cla^m had to be treated first so that the jury

3

would preempt the judge.

4

Now, if that's the mind set that was supposed to

5

bring to jury trial the Seventh Amendment, why shouldn't

6

it be the same in the Sixth Amendment, and you say well,

7

you could argue it as the prosecution is the unit, you

8

could argue it as the crime is the unit, but in view of

9

the importance of jury trial, you take the prosecution as

20

the unit, and if the two add up to more than 6 months, you

21

get a jury trial.

22

MS. PILLARD:

Justice Ginsburg, in the criminal

area as well, where a collateral estoppel issue would

arise and where the jury right would apply to the separate

1

But I think the broader point, whether the

2

importance of the jury right requires a jury right here,

3

is clearly refuted by the common law antecedents of the

jury right, that those were the antecedents that the

Framers had in mind in excluding the petty offenses from

The Court's categorical distinction between

Alternatively, we've argued that to the extent

that the Court does believe that the total aggregate

MS.

PILLARD:

I think the premise of the

aggregation theory is that the accused has a right to

but

1

you're looking at an actual result for the individual

2

defendant.

3

And so the bottom line is that if a case is

4

tried to a judge without a jury, a multiple petty offense

5

case, no sentence in excess of 6 months may validly be

6

imposed under this theory, and Justice Scalia is right to

7

point out this is an alternative theory.

8

We believe that as long as all the petty

9

offenses in a particular prosecution are, in fact,

10

legislatively determined to be petty, that no jury right

11

attaches in that situation, but if you disagree with that,

12

and believe that our aggregation model applies, it follows

13

from that aggregation model that the actual limitation in

14

this case of the sentence to 6 months should obviate any

15

jury-right problem.

16

There's an inherent tension within petitioner's

17

position between its -- between petitioner's reliance on

18

the prosecution as the unit and on section 3584 as the

19

legislative determination whether that unit is serious.

20

As I mentioned before, Congress has not and does

21

not speak to prosecutions.

Congress speaks to individual

22

offenses, and all petitioner can point to to say there's a

23

legislative determination regarding the seriousness of a

24

prosecution as a whole is the statute 3584, but that

25

statute speaks equally to offenses that are not

encompassed within a single prosecution.
In view of this Court's established analysis and

3

its common law antecedents, the only sensible way to make

4

jury trial determinations is to make them on an offense-

specific basis with reference to the legislature's

determination of penalty within the definition of the

particular offense itself.

very rough, anecdotal -- in the range of perhaps 30

It's also worth noting that it's extremely rare

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN M. STATSINGER

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. STATSINGER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

I did not get an opportunity to address our view

8

of the common law procedures in this area, and I did want

9

to take a moment to address them, since it is our position

10

that to the extent there is any evidence of common law

11

practice in this area at all, it does not support the

12

Government's position.

13

The Government has produced no historical

14

evidence that a common law court of summary jurisdiction

15

could exceed its jurisdictional limits simply by virtue of

16

the joinder of petty offenses, yet that is what the

17

Government is asking this Court to permit now.

L8

Since Baldwin, there has been a jurisdictional

L9

limit on the triability of bench trials to 6 months, and

20

the Government is asking the Court to allow joinder to

21

exceed that jurisdictional limit in a way that was never

22

approved of or contemplated at common law.

23

QUESTION:

Do you know whether at common law at

24

the period that would be relevant for us, which would be

25

the time of the founding, that justices committed to

1

prison or to jail as punishments as distinct from simply

2

incarceration awaiting trial?

3

MR. STATSINGER:

It is our understanding that --

4

at least, it is now widely accepted historically that

5

common law justices did have the power to send people to

6

the local jail but not to prison.

I under --

I mean, if that developed afterwards,

MR. STATSINGER:

We would be willing to accept

that there was the authority, even before --

16
17

Well, that would matter.

then it wouldn't be comprehended by the Sixth Amendment.

14
15

That's --we don't have a rough

QUESTION:

I know you would be willing to accept

it, but do you have any authority to that effect?

18

MR. STATSINGER:

19

What it is safe to say is that even assuming

20

there was that authority, and that we assume that as a

21

general framework common law summary courts could

22

incarcerate people for no more than 6 months, they

23

couldn't get around that by virtue of joinder, so to the

24

extent there is a common law basis to this argument at

25

all --

We do not, Justice Souter.

1

QUESTION:

And what cases do you have for that?

2

MR. STATSINGER:

We don't have cases, Justice

3

O'Connor, we have an absence of cases suggesting that the

4

procedure didn't exist.
It is our view that if the Government is going

5

6

to invoke the common law, it has the burden of

7

establishing common law principles that are -- were widely

8

enough accepted to be assumed into the Sixth Amendment,

9

and we don't see any such common law practices that would

10

support the Government's position in this case.
QUESTION:

11

You don't consider relevant to this

12

problem that we have that in the old days, 1791, this

13

would not have been a petty offense, it would have been --

14

this offense would have been a rather serious offense.

Oh, I consider that extremely

relevant, Justice Ginsburg.

L8

this case should have been tried by a jury in the first

place.

20

I think that could

I don't think that the Court has completely

21

abandoned the notion that even a single offense, even if

22

only a petty sentence is authorized, that even a single

23

offense, if it were serious at common law and can be

24

easily established as such, I think that there's still an

25

opening, even in Blandon, that a situation such as that

QUESTION:

Suppose a State legislature said that

if the prosecution in its discretion, at its option, goes

before, say, a municipal court and consolidates offenses,

joins offenses, that in that case the sentence for all

8

combined offenses will be no more than 6 months.

9
10

MR. STATSINGER:

If that were a legislative

Yes, but that if the prosecution had

the option, it elected the option to go to another court,

that the offenses would be greater.

result there?

15

MR. STATSINGER:

What would be the

Well, consistent with our view

16

that it is the legislative judgment that is paramount, we

17

would have to defer to the legislative judgment and

conclude that in that circumstance there would be no jury

trial.
