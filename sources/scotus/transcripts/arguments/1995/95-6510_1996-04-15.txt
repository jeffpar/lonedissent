CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

4

now in Number 95-6510, Coleman Wayne Gray v. J. D.

5

Netherland.

6

Mr. Olive.

7

Mr. Olive, the Respondents contend that the

8

points you're raising here were never really raised in the

9

supreme court of Virginia.

10

Sometime during your argument,

would you address that?

11

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK E. OLIVE

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

MR. OLIVE:

Certainly, Your Honor.

14

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:

15

Truth is discovered through fair process.

Truth

16

is forever lost when an attorney in a case through capital

17

sentencing proceedings, for example, utilizes tactics

18

which violate moral standards of fair play.

19

In Coleman Gray's capital sentencing proceeding,

20

the process was not fair, and the truth will be forever

21

lost unless this Court reinstates the district court's

22

judgment that the State may not mislead defense counsel

23

regarding the determinative issues at trial.

24
25

The Commonwealth's position in this case before
this Court is that you can mislead.

It's not disputed

that there was misleading, and the answer to the

2

misleading is, so what?

3

can do that.

4

off as a result of it.

The State

The Commonwealth did it, but you're no worse

QUESTION:

5

That doesn't matter.

Well, I don't think the answer is

6

that, so what?

I think the answer is, is that it's not

7

clear that you asked for a continuance, or that that was

8

the appropriate remedy.
As I read the colloquy in the trial court, both

10

on the morning and the afternoon of the first day of the

11

sentencing hearing, the discussion was on the Watkins case

12

and whether or not this type of evidence is proper at all,

13

and it's certainly open to interpretation that the

14

attorney made a strategic choice not to ask for a

15

continuance.

16

the way through, and a continuance might have actually

17

hurt him because the prosecution would have had even more

18

time.

That way he could preserve the objection all

1

So that's my concern.

20

MR. OLIVE:

Let me address that, Your Honor,

21

first with the comment that I've searched the respondent's

22

brief and can't find in there the proposition that this

23

did not happen, that the prosecutor did not mislead on day

24

1 and then progress in the misleading on the subsequent

25

days.

1

But the part of the record which I'll be

2

referring the Court to, of course, is December 2nd and

3

December 6th, and there were three separate requests, Your

4

Honor, at that --at those points in time for the State to

5

identify what would be introduced under the preferred

6

practice under Peterson.

7

When they got to the day where the Commonwealth

8

came in and said, we've changed our mind, there was a

9

discussion about Watkins, and the discussion about

10

Watkins, from the point of view of defense counsel, Your

11

Honor, was the comparison between Watkins and what was

12

going on in this case.

13

And the specific point was made that in Watkins,

14

where murders were introduced at capital sentencing,

15

defense counsel in those cases, in that case was also

16

defense counsel in the case that was being introduced, and

17

there was a charge, and defense counsel knew, had notice

18

of what the facts were involved in that case, and so the

19

Watkins argument really was twofold.

20

1.

Yes, this evidence is admissible, but in

21

Watkins, it was admissible against an attorney and a

22

defendant that were prepared.

23

The argument in this case, and making the

24

contrast with Watkins, was specifically that -- and I'll

25

give the quote from the record, page 777, it was

3

participating in representing the defendant.

But contrast this case, page 780.

There

The defense

in this case, Your Honor, was taken by surprise.
QUESTION:

Well, am I correct that trial counsel

7

objected to the admissibility of the Sorrels evidence

8

regardless -- on the independent ground that it was

9

improper --

10

MR. OLIVE:

11

QUESTION:

12

Both.
-- regardless of the matter -- of the

amount of time he had to meet it?

13

MR. OLIVE:

14

QUESTION:

That was one ground.
All right.

And if that's one ground,

15

it seems to me that that was the objection that was made.

16

It's true that they talk about, that you didn't

17

have time, but there was no request for a continuance.

18

MR. OLIVE:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. OLIVE:

Well -And that could be a strategic choice.
The direct quote, and to me the

21

letter -- at least the spirit, if not the letter of the

22

request is on page 780 of the record, and this is after

23

Tucker testified.

24
25

We were prepared for that.

That is, the information that the Commonwealth
told us they were going to introduce, the Tucker

1

statements, we were prepared for that, that's all right,

2

but we're not prepared for this, and the court's response

3

to, you're not prepared, could have been to grant a

4

continuance if they were entitled to be prepared, or to

5

exclude the evidence.

QUESTION:

7

MR. OLIVE:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Was there a motion for a continuance?
The words -You can answer that question yes or

no.
MR. OLIVE:

No, there was -- the words, we move

11

for a continuance, were not spoken, but under the

12

circumstances of the case, it could hardly be interpreted

13

to me in any other fashion.

14

support for, we're not prepared to go forward, as a motion

15

for a continuance --

QUESTION:

At least there is record

Mr. Olive, where did the district

17

judge get this notion.

18

the defense plea for additional time to prepare, the State

19

trial court proceeded without a break.

20
21
22

The district judge said, despite

That implies that there was a request comparable
to one for a continuance.
MR. OLIVE:

And those record citations are to

23

the State court trial record that are in the opinion at

24

that point.

QUESTION:

But there was no explicit plea for

additional time, as distinguished from exclusion.
MR. OLIVE:

2

It is quite true the words were not

3

spoken, please continue this case, but I -- the -- it has

4

the same effect, and let me say why -QUESTION:

5
6

But it's not just yet, it's that the

words were spoken, please exclude this evidence.
MR. OLIVE:

7

That's correct, but the court was

8

placed -- the court was observing defense counsel in a

9

predicament, and the court had been there from the

10

beginning of the predicament to the -QUESTION:

11

Maybe the court should have sua

sponte proposed this alternative.

13

possible argument you have.

MR. OLIVE:

I mean, that's another

I think that -- that's true, and

perhaps it is a due process violation when the court --

Was that or any other series of

arguments addressing this point developed in the Virginia

18

courts?

MR. OLIVE:

On direct appeal, the issue of

whether there should have been a continuance or not, or -QUESTION:

Yes, whether you were derelict, or

22

trial counsel was derelict in failing exclusively to ask

23

for a continuance.

MR. OLIVE:

25

QUESTION:

No.
Was that developed?

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

MR. OLIVE:

That was not developed, and the

2

reason -- to me, a fair reading of this record is, you

3

turn to a judge and you say, Your Honor, we need a

4

continuance in this case because we are not prepared, and

5

in this case, the ruling is the law of the Commonwealth of

6

Virginia, which is, that does not state a basis for a

7

continuance because you are not entitled to be prepared

8

under Virginia Commonwealth law.

9

QUESTION:

Well, that would be clear, perhaps,

10

if you had moved for a continuance, but I don't know that

11

the trial court is required by the Federal Constitution to

12

come to the rescue of an attorney who makes these

13

statements but doesn't move for a continuance.

14

MR. OLIVE:

The Federal district court judge

15

found as a matter of fact that what was being said, the

16

spirit of what was being said was, we need more time to

17

prepare, and under Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, even

18

when the court is looking at a paper record, Federal

19

district court is looking at a paper record --

for exclusion.

But what is the paper record?
It'S -I mean, there seems to be a request

That's the only thing.

basically says this evidence is admissible whether you're

2

ready or not, then a continuance is superfluous.

3

continuance could not show anything to the judge that

would be of any moment.

MR. OLIVE:

On appeal to the -Was the objection on appeal that this

evidence was not admissible, or was the objection that you

10

should have been given more time?

11

the appeal record is that you said it was not admissible.
MR. OLIVE:

12

The only thing I see on

Oh, on the appeal record at pages --

13

the direct appeal brief, at page 3 and maybe a little bit

14

before that, again, defense counsel and appellate counsel

other reasons, it should have been excluded.

We weren't ready, and that's --

QUESTION:

But you -- so you didn't argue -- you

didn't argue in the supreme court of Virginia that the

trial court should have granted you a continuance?

MR. OLIVE:

That is not contained in the -- the

17

language of it, directly, is not expressly contained

there, Chief Justice.

QUESTION:

But the --

20

QUESTION:

On this same line, it appeared to me,

21

reading the Fourth Circuit opinion, that the CA4 was just

22

dealing with the claim and with the district court's

23

holding that your client was entitled to notice of all of

24

the sentencing evidence that was to be used.

25

to be what the CA4 dealt with and what the district court

That seemed

1

2

dealt with.
MR. OLIVE:

The district court actually dealt

3

not with notice but with prosecutor misconduct or

4

deception with respect to what the issues would be.

5

What the district court expressly focused on and

6

found was not that it was a failure of notice, but that it

7

was the prosecutor violating his unequivocal pledge and

8

ambushing the defense through tactics after violating --

9

planning to violate his direct promise,

10

J.A. at 350,

11

direct promise.

12

and this is the

and the prosecutor planned to violate his

So it was not so much in the district court an

13

issue of notice as an issue of a prosecutor taking away

14

someone's due process rights by saying we're going to do A

15

and then actually introducing the issue of B.

16

Now,

in the Fourth Circuit,

it is quite right

17

that the respondent was successful at calling the issue

18

one of notice and actually going so far as to call it one

19

of discovery of every piece of evidence, which has never

20

been the complaint in this case.

21

The complaint has always been, we were told on

22

day 1 that X was going to happen, and we were told on day

23

4 that Y was going to happen,

24

misstatement.

25

proof on one of the most inflammatory cases in the history

and X was an intentional

It intended to deflect us in developing

1

of the Tidewater area, and the reason that that tactic was

2

utilized is because the case couldn't be proved in a fair

3

proceeding.
The Commonwealth came to this proceeding and

said to defense counsel, we're going to do A.

6

7

there's no proof that Coleman Gray committed the Sorrells

8

crime.

9

going to go about proving it is deflection --

10

If we let

The only way we can prove it by the way we're

QUESTION:

Well, but what the district court

11

found was that the constitutional defect in the penalty

12

phase hearing was that Gray was confronted and surprised.

13

It violated Gray's right to fair notice and rendered the

14

hearing unreliable.

15

Now, the district court went on to talk about

16

the prosecutor's tactics, but in its description of what

17

the constitutional violation was, it was a violation of

18

the right to fair notice, and that seemed to be what the

19

Fourth Circuit dealt with, certainly, in its opinion.

20

So it does appear that the present focus of your

21

argument before this Court is somewhat different, namely,

22

before us a focus on whether the defendant has a right to

23

rely on the avowal of the prosecutor that all that would

24

be introduced were the defendant's statements, and because

25

of that, find a due process violation, and that does seem

to be something that was not the subject of the holdings

2

below.
MR. OLIVE:

3

In the district court at page 352 of

4

the Joint Appendix, the district court does talk about

5

notice, but the district court also refers to the moral

6

standards of fair play after describing what can only be

7

described of, if you accept it as correct, not especially

8

moral, a plan to violate a direct promise to defense

9

counsel.
QUESTION:

10

Yes, but it described the

11

constitutional violation as the violation of lack of fair

12

notice.

13

MR. OLIVE:

But when I go on in that sentence,

14

the district court Judge Spencer is saying the

15

Commonwealth's Attorney, Ferguson's tactics, and that's

16

not a matter of notice, per se, violated the moral

17

standards of fair play and violated the Due Process

18

Clause, so to me that is -- what went awry here was,

19

indeed, notice, but this is notice plus.

20

This isn't even very difficult.

This is

21

intentional misleading.

or not someone was given 3 days, 2 days, 4 days, or 30

23

days, and whether due process requires --

It's not just a matter of whether

Yes, but it has to be that, because

let's assume that there was deliberate deception.

doesn't follow from that that there must be some kind of

MR. OLIVE:

QUESTION:

We ask what

Well -Is there a request for a continuance?

Is there a request to exclude the evidence?
Here, the thrust of the argument made in the

State court was that the evidence had to be excluded, and

9

now you're shifting ground.

10

MR. OLIVE:

I -- my position on the State court

record, like the district court's position on it, and I

12

don't think it's an unreasonable one, is when I stand up

13

and say, I'm not ready, the judge knows that I'm asking

14

for a couple of things.

Either give me more time, or keep

That's the only two ways of interpreting I'm not

further you -- the further away you get from prosecutorial

misconduct, from knowing lying, the more you back into

Teague.
The closer you can bring your case to that, to

that the prosecutor said one thing knowing he was going to

doesn't bar this, but as you get away from that, certainly

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. McLEES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Stated simply, the essence of Mr. Gray's

20
21

position is that the common -- is that the Constitution

22

required exclusion of this Sorrell murders evidence

because of what was, at the very worst, a discovery

24

violation.

Now, if it was reasonable for the trial court to

1

conclude that the Constitution did not require exclusion

2

of that evidence, then the ruling that Gray is asking for

3

today would be a new rule in Federal habeas corpus, and it

4

cannot be announced in review of a State court judgment.

5

We submit that it was eminently reasonable for

6

the trial court to conclude the Constitution didn't

7

require exclusion of this evidence.

8

reasonable even today, much less in 19 --

9

QUESTION:

It would be

Well, if the finding were -- and you

10

may dispute this, but if the finding were that the

11

prosecutor intentionally misled defense counsel as to what

12

evidence he intended to use, and that that misleading was

13

important in the preparation of the defense and was relied

14

upon by the defense, that wouldn't be a new rule, would

15

it?

16

MR. McLEES:

Well, if it were a straightforward

17

application of the Donnelly test -- Donnelly v.

18

DeChristoforo, where prosecutorial misconduct, if it

19

infects the entire proceeding with unfairness, amounts to

20

a due process violation -- if it were simply a

21

straightforward application of that standard, no, Your

Honor, it would not be a new rule.

QUESTION:

MR. McLEES:

Some kind of hybrid -He tries to say, I have both here.
He tries to make it a hybrid claim,

10

and for that reason we submit it's a new rule, but even if

11

it were simply a matter of applying Donnelly, not only is

12

it contrary to what his conception of his rule is, it

13

wouldn't be cert worthy for this Court to simply decide if

14

the facts of this case met the Donnelly standard.

15

But even if this Court addressed the Donnelly

16

standard, that requires a showing that the misconduct, or

17

what the prosecutor did, rendered the proceeding

fundamentally unfair.

of that sort is not the prosecutor's good faith or bad

The proceeding that we're talking about here

5

MR. McLEES:

6

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Your claim is that assuming there was

7

an intent to mislead, that it was important, as Justice

8

O'Connor put it, to the preparation by the defense to meet

9

the issues raised at sentencing, that that would not

infect the fairness of the entire proceeding, sentencing

My argument, Your Honor, is that on

intentional misleading, you cannot find that it infected

19

the entire sentencing proceeding with unfairness for

misconduct, he had no notice of it in advance, and Melvin

All right.

There was a claim which

people have called the inadequate notice claim.

8

MR. McLEES:

9

QUESTION:

Right.
Okay.

Let's forget the content of

10

that claim for the moment, but there's something called an

11

inadequate notice claim.

12

Now, my reading of this suggests that the

13

district court in this case said such claim was

14

consistently raised in the State courts and is not

15

procedurally defaulted, that also in your brief in that

16

court you said, inadequate notice was raised on direct

17

appeal and in State habeas corpus, that in one of the

18

State habeas corpus proceedings they said, or you argued,

19

I guess, that you -- or conceded that the inadequate

20

notice subclaim was raised on direct appeal and in State

21

habeas corpus, that the State habeas corpus court found

22

that number 9, which is the inadequate notice claim, was

23

decided adversely at trial -1

MR. McLEES:

2

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Okay.

So that's why they never -- so

3

then the only question is -- and you never said anything

4

to the contrary in any brief in the Fourth Circuit.
So now we can try to divide that inadequate

5
6

notice claim into two parts, I guess.

7

the claim of, it was inadequate notice and therefore they

8

should have kept the evidence out, versus the claim that,

9

it was inadequate notice and therefore they should have

10

given us more time.

11

right?

12

MR. McLEES:

13

QUESTION:

One, we could say

That's what you want to do, is that

Well -Or, I mean, I've never met in any

15

seen that people divided things that finely.

MR. McLEES:

18

for me to see how we should go off on these procedural

19

bars, and whether it was adequately raised and so forth.

20

That's my problem.

21

MR. McLEES:

Well, because -- because, Your

22

Honor, whether you characterize it as an inadequate notice

23

claim or a prosecutorial misconduct claim, or some hybrid

24

combination of the two, the bottom line is, what effect

25

did it have on the penalty trial?

Did it render the

QUESTION:

the notice claim.

deals with how much the defense has a constitutional right

to know about the evidence against him and when, and the

other is Langford v. Idaho, that -- which he never cited

Mr. McLees, before we get to specific

cases, there's one overall problem that's troubling me

8

about saying, I told all the facts about what happened,

9

and I pinned some kind of general due process label on it,

10

but not necessarily the right one, and then I think about

11

how civil proceedings are, where we know, if you don't ask

12

for the right relief but you're entitled to it, Rule 54(c)

13

says you get it, and yet we seem to be demanding this

14

persnicketiness in proceeding on the criminal side, when

15

it's a question literally of life or death.

16

to me that there's something out of sync there.

17

MR. McLEES:

It just seems

Well, if it's a question of whether

18

the defense attorney had to expressly ask for continuance,

there's a reason why we draw a fine line between asking

for a continuance and objecting and asking for

exclusion --

12

discretion to grant a recess for continuance if the

QUESTION:

Do you think there's anything -- the

lawyer for the defendant did say he was unprepared to meet

the evidence.

That much is clear.

MR. McLEES:

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Do you think there's anything in the

10

record that suggests that the judge would have granted a

11

continuance if he'd been specifically asked for it?
MR. McLEES:

12

I don't think that there's anything

13

that suggests that he would not have granted the

continuance, but I think the shoe has to be on the other

foot.

QUESTION:

I mean, he does have a duty to

terminate the proceeding as promptly as he can with a

MR. McLEES:

QUESTION:

MR. McLEES:

Well -Or he could have given him 3 days.
If you take Mr. Gray at his word,

he would have said, Your Honor, no amount of preparation

what they said in their State habeas corpus petition.

that the

MR. McLEES:

No, because still, to show

fundamental unfairness of the proceeding, he, Mr. Gray, as

a habeas corpus petitioner, would have to show how the

result -- how the proceeding would have gone differently,

6

how the result probably would have been different had the

evidence either been excluded, or had he been granted the

8

continuance.

9

First of all, defense counsel who defended

10

Mr. Gray at trial had, after the jury penalty trial in the

11

first week of December 1985, they had 2 months between

12

that time and the sentencing hearing before the judge

13

alone in February 1986, within which they could have

14

investigated the Sorrell murders, uncovered whatever they

15

wanted to say about Timothy Sorrell, and presented that to

the trial judge in support of a motion for a new penalty

Wrongly admitted, it's

shouldn't have admitted this evidence because there was

with you, what he calls it at the beginning is a motion.

exclusion, but it's somewhat ambiguous in that first --

15

would your normal experience in Virginia practice suggest

that under those circumstances the judge would think the

he's never asked for it?

Mr. McLees, I want to follow up on

this business of meticulousness in pleadings, because it

seems that it turns entirely on the lawyer appointed to

Well, they could have done so, but

20

what reason would they have done so if their understanding

21

was that the only thing they had to do was to discredit a

22

snitch?

23

MR. McLEES:

Well, because, Your Honor, that's

24

not the position they took at the time.

25

the Court looks at the record of the -- when they asked -48

At the time, if

1

on the Monday morning, when they asked the prosecutor what

2

evidence he's going to present in the penalty phase, they

3

say, we have good reason to believe you're going to put on

4

evidence connecting Mr. Gray with the Sorrell murders,

5

that he may have -- evidence that he may have told some

6

other people he committed the murders.

7

absolute dynamite, and we need to be prepared for that.

8

So even the snitch testimony they regarded as

9
10

This evidence is

absolute dynamite.
QUESTION:

Well, but they only prepared for the

11

dynamite that they understood they were going to be

12

exposed to, and there was no reason that I know of on the

13

record why they would have been -- why they would have

14

prepared for any other dynamite.

15

MR. McLEES:

But even after the penalty phase

16

proceeding, they didn't investigate the other -- they

17

didn't investigate the Timothy Sorrell angle and present

18

that evidence to try to get a new trial, because they

19

concluded that they had adequately --

20

QUESTION:

No, but I think this goes back to

21

something that was raised before.

You have never claimed,

22

I think, that they are barred from making the argument

23

they make now because in the period after trial they did

24

not go into -- they did not make an investigation and come

25

forward with evidence that they would have presented.

MR. McLEES:

2

QUESTION:

We have argued that.
Is that in your brief in opposition?

3

Because I mean, if that's the case, and that amounts to a

4

waiver under Virginia law, and that was preserved, then we

5

certainly shouldn't have taken this case, but I -- I don't

6

have the brief in opposition in front of me, but I didn't

7

think you made that argument.
MR. McLEES:

8

9

I believe we did, Your Honor.

We

made it in our Fourth Circuit brief.
QUESTION:

10

But you think in the brief in

11

opposition to this Court you said, they are barred because

12

they did not make an investigation in the 2-week or 2-

13

month period, whatever it is, after the trial, and come

14

forward with a proffer of evidence?

15

MR. McLEES:

I believe we did.

We said they

16

could have been done then, and therefore could have been

17

presented on direct appeal.

18

QUESTION:

Well, would you agree that if you

19

didn't make it in your brief in opposition, that that

20

would not be an appropriate subject for us to get into

21

here?

22

MR. McLEES:

Not as a procedural bar, but as it

23

reflects to the fundamental fairness of the sentencing

24

proceeding, it's still relevant whether it's a procedural

25

bar or not, because it shows that -50

QUESTION:

1

Well, but you in effect, then, are

2

saying that the trial judge should have made a fundamental

3

fairness judgment based upon evidence which the defendant

4

had no reason, based on the prosecutor's representation,

5

to have been prepared to present to the trial judge, and

6

therefore the -- in effect, the -- any ruling by the trial

7

court will either stand or fall depending on what is

8

developed after trial.
MR. McLEES:

9

Is that your argument?
Not exactly, Your Honor.

What I'm

10

saying is that as a habeas corpus petitioner, it is

11

incumbent upon Mr. Gray to show what difference all these

12

alleged violations make, and how the proceeding --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. McLEES:

15

You mean, in State habeas?
In State habeas and in Federal

habeas.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. McLEES:

18

QUESTION:

Okay.
Even if we -But there again, if you did not raise

19

that in your brief in opposition, it seems to me you're

20

raising a matter which goes to a procedural bar, and if

21

you didn't raise it in the brief in opposition, I'm not

22

sure why we should get into it.

23

MR. McLEES:

Because I think it's relevant, Your

24

Honor, to a showing of prejudice, to showing -- if you

25

just look at this case on the merits -51

QUESTION:

No, but you let us -- in effect, if

2

you didn't get into this in the brief in opposition, you

3

let us take the case on the assumption that there wasn't

this kind of prejudice-bar problem.

MR. McLEES:

6

QUESTION:

Well --

7

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. McLees.

8

Mr. Olive, you have 4 minutes remaining.

11

I see my time has expired.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK E. OLIVE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. OLIVE:

The respondent has not contended

12

that the request or lack of a request expressly for a

13

continuance, or the failure to have developed any

14

information about the Sorrells crime after sentencing, or

15

before sentencing, after the jury verdict, constitutes an

16

adequate and independent State court ground for this Court

17

to observe, because there are no cases that so state.

18

There is no Virginia case that says, if you want

19

this sort of evidence to be excluded, or you want more

20

time in order to address this evidence, you have to move

21

for a continuance instead of moving for exclusion.

22

QUESTION:

23

deciding that issue?

24

MR. OLIVE:

25

QUESTION:

Well, do you feel we should be

Do you feel that that is a decision

1

that we should make as to whether, in fact, it would

2

constitute a bar, or wouldn't constitute a bar?

3

MR. OLIVE:

4

QUESTION:

I don't think it's in the cas.
Okay.

Was it -- you may recall my

5

question, my last question to counsel which adverted

6

specifically to the obligation to investigate for post

7

trial relief.

8

in the brief in opposition?

9

Was that issue raised as a basis for a bar

MR. OLIVE:

I don't recall.

I do recall that

10

there has never been any contention by respondent that

11

there is any requirement in the State of Virginia that a

12

person do this, these things, in order to avoid a bar.

13

There are no such cases.

14

And I would like to address Justice Kennedy's

15

earlier question about tactics and strategy.

16

counsel testified below, and they testified that they were

17

blown away by this, and that they wanted -- I can't quote

18

that they said, we wanted a continuance, but certainly the

19

spirit of their testimony, and I can't call it all, bring

20

it all to mind at this point, was that they needed time,

21

and this was not a trick or a strategy on their part, and

22

they went into great detail about how devastating this was

23

to them.

24
25

QUESTION:

Defense

Why didn't they make that argument on

habeas, then, on State habeas?

Why did they say on State

QUESTION:

Well -That's what they said.

Do you want

me to read it to you?

MR. OLIVE:

QUESTION:

10

-- no amount of time would have done

us any good?

5

7

Well --

MR. OLIVE:

I think -- no.
That's what they said.
I know what that says, and I think

11

that that was hyperbole about how devastating the case was

12

about Sorrells.

13

a devastating case, and I think that that is hyperbole.

14

If you read the newspapers, that case is

QUESTION:

I don't think it was hyperbole.

I

15

think it was a devastating case, and I think the defense

16

wanted to keep that evidence out.

17

MR. OLIVE:

18

QUESTION:

19

Absolutely.
I don't think it would have made any

difference to the defense if it had 3 more days.

20

MR. OLIVE:

21

QUESTION:

I think that -I think they wanted above all things

22

to keep that evidence out, and it's very important, it

23

seems to me, that we not let an argument that wasn't made,

24

a request that was not made to the States, later be made

25

to Federal courts when it turns out that the trial

strategy employed by the defense has not produced the

2

result desired.

3

MR. OLIVE:

They wanted it excluded, but if they

had the evidence that was unearthed in the Federal

district court, it would have been a powerful tool against

it.

were tied with respect to --

It was a devastating case only because their hands

8

QUESTION:

Mr. Olive, can I ask you kind of a

9

question about Virginia law?

What is the threshold, if

10

any, that limits the prosecutor's ability to put in in a

11

penalty hearing evidence of some other murder that you

12

have very little reason to believe the defendant

13

committed?

14
15

MR. OLIVE:

At the time of this trial, there was

no threshold.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. OLIVE:

No threshold at all.
No, and now there's no threshold,

18

but there is a notice requirement.

19

a certain quantum of proof.

20

QUESTION:

You don't have to have

But could they put in, and just say

21

give notice -- I'm going to serve notice that I'm going to

22

prove that the Unabomber committed a lot of crimes?

23

MR. OLIVE:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. OLIVE:

Yes, Your Honor.
That would be enough?
Yes, Your Honor.

what the law is in the Commonwealth, and that stating that

I am not prepared to address this is not a grounds for
