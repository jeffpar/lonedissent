ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. PAUL NEEDHAM

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS/RESPONDENTS

ZICHERMAN, ET AL.
MR. NEEDHAM:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

12

On September 1, 1983, Muriel Kole lost her life

13

as a result of the wilful misconduct of Korean Air Lines.

14

Suit was instigated in the Federal District Court pursuant

15

to the Warsaw Convention, and loss of society damages were

16

awarded by a jury.

17

Loss of society damages, it is our position,

18

pursuant to Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention, are

19

damages sustained.

20

1934.

21

It is our position that based on the plain meaning of

22

those words, damage equals loss, and loss equals loss of

23

society.

24
25

That is a treaty entered into force in

The phrase is damage sustained, or dommage survenu.

This is consistent with French civil law, and
this Court in Saks said that French civil law plays a role

in determining the interpretation of the word, dommage

2

survenu, and when the phrase dommage survenu, or damage

3

sustained, is used, there was no pecuniary restriction.

4
5

QUESTION:

The world adopted French civil law

when it subscribed to the Warsaw Treaty?
MR. NEEDHAM:

6

No, it did not, Your Honor, but

7

French civil law is one indication of the meaning of those

8

words at the time it was drafted.

9

did not attend, it was in French, and the French civil law

10

and continental jurists drafted it, and in Saks this Court

11

says that -QUESTION:

Since the United States

I don't understand.

the meaning of dommage, or do we not?

Do we look to French civil law for

We do.

We do, and French civil law governs.
It governs --

And the Warsaw Treaty adopted French

civil law.

MR. NEEDHAM:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. NEEDHAM:

It did --

It seems to me very unlikely.
It did to the extent -- this Court

23

in Saks said that you look to French civil law because

24

that's the law that was used when it was drafted, and

dommage survenu in French civil law includes both dommage

moral and dommage material, which is both the pecuniary-

2

damages and the moral damages.

3

QUESTION:

Every element of damages that French

4

civil law includes can be recovered under the Warsaw

5

Treaty, and every element of damages that French civil law

6

does not permit to be recovered must be excluded?

7

MR. NEEDHAM:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Now, is this French civil law as it

is amended from year to year, or is it the French civil
law that was in effect at the time the -MR. NEEDHAM:

11
12

Yes, Your Honor, and I think --

I believe it would be the French

civil law that was in effect at the time.

13

QUESTION:

In effect at the time --

14

MR. NEEDHAM:

But more than anything, Your

15

Honor, it's the plain meaning, because this Court in

16

interpreting treaties, and in the Chan case this Court

17

looked at plain meaning, and in the Chan case, Your

18

Honor - -

19

QUESTION:

If we are to take seriously your

20

argument that French law, French jurisprudence controls,

21

then what mustn't we take into account all of French law,

22

that is, how it in fact applies in France, and no matter

23

how many elements of damages -- of damage would be

24

included in the word dommage, still, there are no juries

25

in France, and awards on all of the items are more modest

1

than they are in the United States.
So can you pick the part of the French law that

2

3

you like, that is, the list of what's included in damages,

4

but leave out the fact that the recovery is likely to be a

5

lot lower if you have the same case before a French trier?
MR. NEEDHAM:

6

We look at French civil law to

7

determining the meaning of the phrase, dommage survenu,

8

and we note that they did not restrict it to pecuniary

9

laws.

That's the main thrust of our argument, not that

10

the entire convention is governed by French civil law, but

11

that the definition of -QUESTION:

12

I just -- if -- let's just say pain

13

and suffering would be an element, but in fact pain and

14

suffering damages awarded in French cases do not compare

15

with the size of awards in this country.

16

of the French law that would apply, if, indeed, French law

17

controls?

18

MR. NEEDHAM:

Isn't that part

If French law controlled

19

everything, that would the case, Your Honor, but in this

20

case we are before you on loss of society, and the narrow

21

question is whether the phrase dommage survenu in French

22

law, the phrase dommage, includes loss of society or

23

dommage moral, and we contend that it does.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Needham, the Warsaw

Convention also contains Article 24, and under Article 24,
6

1

which refers back to Article 17, where you find the phrase

2

dommage survenu, it appears to leave the level and nature

3

of damages under the Warsaw Convention subject to

4

limitations and law of the signatory nations.

5
6

7

Article 24, subsection 2, has to have some
meaning.
MR. NEEDHAM:

Well, Your Honor, we would contend

8

that subsection 2 of Article 24 refers to the procedural

9

matters to the State, and it reads that without prejudice

10

to the questions as to who are the persons who have the

11

right to bring suit, and what are their respective rights

12

-- rather than saying what are their rights, what are

13

their respective rights.

14

And our reading of that is, respective meaning

15

what are their rights vis-a-vis one another.

16

their rights, who has standing to bring the suit, who may

17

recover, what special questions go to the jury, and that

18

the plain meaning doctrine still applies, the plain

19

meaning of the word.

20

What are

And this Court in the Chan case looked very

21

closely at the Warsaw Convention, in Article 3, where it

22

says ticket delivered, and said it could not substitute

23

the phrase, a conforming ticket delivered, or a regular

24

ticket delivered, and we contend in this case you would

25

have to insert the phrase, dommage material survenu, or

1

pecuniary damages.

2

QUESTION:

Well, what about a signatory State

3

that does not permit a cause of action after death to a

4

survivor, only to the estate of the decedent?

5

Article 24 refer us back to who should recover under the

6

law of the signatory State?

7

MR. NEEDHAM:

Would

I think it would to the extent

8

that that State decides who may bring the lawsuits and who

9

is entitled to have which question submitted to the jury.
QUESTION:

10

Isn't that a strange, strange system

11

you're -- I mean, French law governs what damage may be

12

recovered, but local law governs who gets the damages.

13

Why would anyone create a system like that?

14

bizarre.
MR. NEEDHAM:

15

It seems so

Well, reading through the minutes,

16

Your Honor, the United States was not present.

17

civil law countries, common law countries, and the

18

convention has a whole series of very, almost conflicting

19

terms.

20

QUESTION:

You had

No, I understand that, but I never

21

look at that stuff anyway, but it seems to me if you have

22

alternate interpretations of the text, you shouldn't

23

impose the one that creates a bizarre result, and it seems

24

bizarre to me that French law should determine whether

25

there can be recovery, but local law shall determine who

gets the recovery.

MR. NEEDHAM:

2

3

That's what you're arguing.
Well, Your Honor, I would

submit --

4

QUESTION:

That can be avoided by interpreting

5

Article 25 as Justice O'Connor suggested it could be

6

interpreted.

7
8

MR. NEEDHAM:

Well, when the Warsaw Convention

wanted a reference to local law, they were very specific.
In Article 21, Article 28, Article 2 , they said local

10

law, go to local law.

11

argument, and we think that that is consistent with the

12

damage cap.

13

So that's our -- that's our

This is a unique treaty where there is a damage

14

cap, and when this treaty was negotiated, at the time it

15

was negotiated there was great concern about the airline

16

industry not staying in business.

17

that any large liability lost and they'd be out of

18

business.

1
20
21

QUESTION:

There was great concern

Did the French -- did French law

determine the meaning of misconduct in this case?
MR. NEEDHAM:

It did not.

There is a specific

22

provision in Article 25 that you can use the phrase,

23

wilful misconduct, or whatever equivalent you have in your

24

local law, and in that case they were very specific about

25

going to local law.

(800) FOR DEPO

1

But it's interesting to note, even in its

2

infancy when there was great concern about the viability

3

of the airline industry, even then the Warsaw Convention

4

determined that if there is wilful misconduct there is no

5

pact, so even at a time when they were very concerned

6

about being able to attract capital, very concerned about

7

being able to get insurance, even at that time they

8

concluded that if there was wilful misconduct there was no

9

cap, and if there's wilful misconduct and there's no cap,

10

then there are limited damages, and we contend to deter

11

the wrongful misconduct, and because there is a deterrence

12

factor, and because there are not punitive damages

13

available, this Court must allow a broad range of

14

compensatory damages.

15

To have a cap off so there's wilful misconduct

16

that needs to be deterred, and then to graft on some

17

restrictive interpretation of the phrase, dommage survenu,

18

would give the airline a double layer of protection that

19

it did not negotiate --

20

QUESTION:

Was there not a report that a

21

company -- at the time that the Warsaw Convention was

22

originally drafted that said there were the two problems,

23

the who and the what damages, that they couldn't

24

successfully resolve and both were referred to local law.

25

The two questions, what persons in the case of death would

1

recover and what are the damages subject to reparation,

2

the report accompanying the treaty said it wasn't possible

3

to find a satisfactory solution, so those questions were

4

not regulated by the convention itself.

5

Now, you're telling us that dommage must mean

what it means in the French law.

time of the drafting that says that.

8

any practice abroad with respect to the interpretation of

9

this treaty that everyone looks to the French civil law to

10

see how it should be construed?

MR. NEEDHAM:

There's no report at the
Are you relying on

I'm relying more on the plain

12

meaning of the words, and the plain meaning of the words

13

as they appear in the treaty.

14

QUESTION:

However, if this Court.

Am I correct that all of the foreign

15

courts that have grappled with this except one have

16

applied local law rather than French law --

20

Well, there's the --

-- and that one court was overruled

by statute?
MR. NEEDHAM:

Well, that one court is Preston v.

22

there's the Israeli case which this Court cited with some

23

disfavor in Floyd when it awarded emotional damages,

good jurisprudential policy to give it a wide meaning.

2

However, if this Court concludes --

3

QUESTION:

Why was that?

Did they say why it

was good jurisprudential policy to give it a wide meaning

rather than a narrow meaning?
MR. NEEDHAM:

I don't know.

It concerned the

the court concluded -QUESTION:

10

They had no

Jurisprudence favors plaintiffs

11

rather than defendants, is that the jurisprudential

12

principle?

13

MR. NEEDHAM:

Well, I think the principle is

14

that a treaty with a cap such as this, when the cap is

15

off, that the good jurisprudential policy is to give the

16

plain meaning of the words and to give adequate

17

compensation.

18

This Court --

QUESTION:

That may be perfectly -- the plain

19

meaning of the word sounds fine.

20

sounds fine, but what you're saying is, in effect, we put

21

a thumb on the scale, that, you know, if you have an

22

interpretation that perhaps is evenly balanced between a

23

narrower and a broader one favoring plaintiffs, you favor

24

the broader one.

25

Adequate compensation

Why on earth is that?

I favor the broader one in this

In that very unusual instance, and one of the

8

amicus briefs points out there's only eight reported cases

9

of wilful misconduct since 1934, when that occurs the cap

10

should be off.

11

nothing else, there should be a broad range of

12

compensatory damages to deter the wrongful misconduct and

13

to allow compensation to the plaintiffs, who suffer under

Yes, Your Honor, and the treaty

says that the airlines or the carrier may not invoke that

and that sort of thing, that you just bend every effort to

maximize the plaintiff's recovery.

MR. NEEDHAM:

We do not, Your Honor.

We say in

this particular case that there is no grief, there are no

MR. NEEDHAM:

We do.

QUESTION:

11

do you suppose, in this case?

12

Could you file suit under Korean law,

MR. NEEDHAM:

Well, there was -- there's one

part of the Death on the High Seas Act that allows you

under 7 -- section 764 to use the law of the carrier.

15

That may be one possibility, to use Korean law.

concludes that the damages under the Warsaw Convention are

controlled by French civil law but rather by the law of

applies, not Korean law, U.S. law of some sort.
MR. NEEDHAM:

3

Well, that was not in our

particular case, and I believe they were talking about the

list of beneficiaries and who are the proper parties to

bring the cas, and they looked to the Death on the High

by Korean Air Lines to make this a DOHSA case, to make

this a Jones Act case, is simply inappropriate.
The Jones Act and the Death on the High Seas Act

were passed in 1920.
QUESTION:

5

But that's not -- that, I take it, is

6

not the argument.

The argument is, how do you fill in

7

this term, and if we reject your argument that it has a

8

plain meaning, then there are several sources of law you

9

could consult.

You've mentioned some of them.

You can

10

look at the laws of other States, you can look at general

11

maritime law, but why isn't the most appropriate reference

12

a statute passed by Congress meant to deal with tragedies

13

of a similar kind?
MR. NEEDHAM:

14

Your Honor, the statute passed by

15

Congress, and this Court in Alves said that it was hastily

16

enacted, it was not the product of attentive judicial

17

review, and was merely to fill a gap for death on the high

18

seas.
It is a pecuniary law statute.

19

It is an

20

employment-related compensation statute that was designed

21

to compensate the bread-winner who may have been injured

22

on the high seas.

statute that was passed to fill a gap.

MR. NEEDHAM:

Do you have a citation?
I do, Your Honor.

The citation on

Alves is 446 U.S. 274, and the particular page, on page

6

282 to 283, that states that DOHSA and the Jones Act

7

should not be accorded overwhelming analogical weight in

8

formulating remedies under general maritime law because

9

they were hastily enacted within days of each other, yet

10

are hopelessly inconsistent and not the product of

attentive judicial review.

MR. NEEDHAM:

Well, in Miles this Court did

21

apply it, but I think Miles is very distinguishable,

because you had a Jones Act seaman, and I think what this

MR. NEEDHAM:

that trumps the treaty obligation that comes 14 years

10

later.
QUESTION:

That's true if the treaty refers to

couldn't reach a settlement, or whatever.

Okay.

Now, my question is really Justice O'Connor's.

I then go to Article 24.

This would all happen 12 years

7

ago.

8

to say that you apply the local law.

to say.

Twelve years ago we'd look to Article 24.

It seems

That's what it seems

I grant you it's a little ambiguous, but I would

10

have thought at least there's a chance you'd apply local

11

law.

12

And at that point I'd ask, what does a court in

13

the United States do, and I guess the first question that

14

a court in the United States would have under, were there

15

never any Warsaw Treaty, would be, oh, I have an accident

16

in the Sea of Japan with a Korean airplane shot down by

17

some Russians, and the only American connection is the

18

identity of the victim.

19

So I would have wondered whether American law

20

would be applied by an American court, and my question is,

21

what happened?

22

happened, or is that question in the case, or what is the

23

law that applies under American law?

In other words, it's a normal rule of

conflicts that even if you have an accident that happens

No, no, I'm talking about without the

I would imagine that the first question would be,

10

if Article 24 applies and you're supposed to use local

law, what the treaty tells you to do is pretend there is

would be, what law applies for an American court?

QUESTION:

I was making the assumption that

Article 17 is ambiguous and doesn't give you the clear

answer that you think, that Article 24 says, courts of the

world, apply your own law when you decide the meaning and

12

shape out who gets to what kinds of damages.

13

On those assumptions, what am I supposed to do?

14

MR. NEEDHAM:

Under those assumptions you are

supposed to apply, I would contend, a Federal common law

you wouldn't get caught in this hodge podge of conflicting

to me as I read the papers in this case that both of you

MR. HARAKAS:

In the action that was pled

here -- there were actions pled under the Warsaw

Right.

MR. HARAKAS:

Now, under the Death on the High

Now, with respect to the choices of law issue,

there is the Harris case from the Ninth Circuit where the

MR. HARAKAS:

1

Exactly.

You could have a Warsaw

2

Convention case, but then there can be -- there's nothing

3

in the convention that would preclude you from applying --

4

doing a choice-of-law analysis, and in fact the drafters,

5

when they were drafting the convention, were unable to

agree to that specific issue because of the very different

7

views with respect to which law do you apply, and -QUESTION:

So that issue is not before us.

And may I ask, just to get one

thought sorted out in my mind, here, under American law,

your argument is the death occurred on the high seas, so

the statute -- the statute applies.
If the death had occurred, say, in flight over

your view?

No, Your Honor.

that in that situation, that if you want to have a desire

for uniform law, because the convention does -- is a

Once you decide you're not going to

interpret dommage the way the French do, it seems to me

you've abandoned any desire for uniform law.

Well, that's correct with respect

10

to -- at the international level.

The drafters never

accepted the fact that they cannot come up with one

3

and where do you read in the Warsaw Convention some notion

4

that the law of the signatory State has to be uniform in

giving the answers to those questions?

6

MR. HARAKAS:

Well, there's no specific

7

provision in the convention because when they were

drafting the convention I don't -- the drafters were not

9

looking to the Federal system that we have in our country,

10

11
12

13

in any specific country.
Of course, the United States had only sent
observers to the conference.

They were more concerned --

they were looking at nations as a whole, and what happens

14

domestically, the drafters didn't address that issue, but

15

when you look to the convention, I think in our system it

does create -- it is a Federal treaty, and it should be

interpreted at the Federal level with one consistent,

uniform law.

MR. HARAKAS:

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Where we thought that there ought to

be this uniformity, and that wasn't a watery death, so

5

they had some Federal common law, general maritime law,

6

which is a little more giving than DOHSA, right?

7

MR. HARAKAS:

That's correct, they did look to

general maritime law, and the problem with that case is,

9

they looked to Gaudet as representative of general

QUESTION:

And Lockerbie is not California.

Well, the Lockerbie --

You could say that Lockerbie properly

came out the way it did without necessarily saying that if

the crash -- if Lockerbie occurred in California,

California law wouldn't --

22

MR. HARAKAS:

You could do that, and in our case

that is a necessary determination to be made in our case,

The only point I'm making here is that, if the

1

2

Court wants to address the Lockerbie case in order to come

3

up with unified rule as what the Lockerbie court was

4

concerned with, then the proper rule should be taken from

looking to other Federal wrongful death statutes.
QUESTION:

6

Can I ask you -- I'm not -- one

7

puzzle that I have in my mind still, which maybe you've

8

just answered to Justice Scalia, is how does this work in

your -- in your mind, the treaty refers you to, say, the

10

Eastern District of Iowa, or whatever it is.
Now, we're in the Eastern District of Iowa, and

11

12

the first thing that they have -- say, that judge there is

13

a Federal judge, and the treaty said judge, you apply the

14

law you would apply normally without the treaty.

right?

16

MR. HARAKAS:

That's

That's right.

Okay.

So why isn't the first thing

18

the judge would do is say, the first thing I have to

19

decide for a case where the accident happens over in

20

Japan, in the international sea, to the Korean Airline

21

with an American passenger, is, what law applies, all

22

right.

23

Now, why isn't that in this case?

MR. HARAKAS:

Can you say,

we all agree that the law of Tibet applies?

I think all parties have

MR. HARAKAS:

No, of course -- parties can't

agree to tell the court what law that --

7

QUESTION:

Yes, all right, so the first thing

8

the judge in Iowa does is, he gets out the Death on the

9

High Seas Act.

The Death on the High Seas Act gives

10

anybody in the world a right of action if they're killed

11

on the high seas.

12

MR. HARAKAS:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Okay.

So there we have in the court

14

of Iowa, we have a person from Italy who was killed in an

15

airline accident in Korea by a Japanese, so the first

16

thing -- or in the Sea of Japan, so the first thing I'd

17

wonder is, what law applies.

18

MR. HARAKAS:

What law would apply there?

Well, in that case, then, you

19

could -- if the parties brought it up, you could make a

It's the real situation.

The judge

in Iowa picks the page up, chapter 21, Death on the High

that is that the Death on the High Seas Act does give the

Mr. Harakas,

I'd like you to go back

1

situation in defining local law to be not only the -- not

2

the conduct-regulating rule, but the choice-of-law rule,

3

which could then get you over into some other system, and

4

then you must ask, is it the whole law, including the

5

choice-of-law rule?

6

So in many legal contexts, local law is

7

understood to mean not the choice of law rule, but you go

8

directly to the conduct-regulating rule, or the damage-

9

setting rule.

You do not go to the choice-of-law just so

10

you will avoid this kind of problem that conflicts

11

teachers sometimes call the rondure.

12

MR. HARAKAS:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

So in the Warsaw Convention, is there

14

nothing that tells us whether local law means whole law of

15

the country, or substantive law of the country?

MR. HARAKAS:

The -- there's no specific

provision saying that in those terms, but with respect to

20

I think when you look to, let's say Article 28,

or other various provisions, it's always referenced in

22

terms of the law of the court where the action is pending.

MR. HARAKAS:

I would say it would include the

want to deal with that issue, because every time they

about looking into foreign laws, the pleader does have the

3

option to bring in elements of foreign law within the

4

Death on the High Seas Act.

5

I think here, when you have an international

6

crash on the high seas, and you do have a Death on the

High Seas Act that is applicable, that does give the court

jurisdiction, and at that point, the elements of damages

But if other courts in a number of

other cases would, and would apply foreign law, then this
case has less significance than it would otherwise.

4

MR. HARAKAS:

I don't think so, because even

with respect to the application of foreign law, if the

don't get into now because I don't think you have to, but

if it does, then the issue comes down to, what are those

were killed were not from the United States.

everything arose on the high seas, and that's enough to

trigger the applicability of the Death on the High Seas

Act.

QUESTION:

And the plaintiffs here were

Americans.
MR. HARAKAS:

The plaintiffs here were

Americans, in this case.

22

QUESTION:

23

I think the light is dawning.

24
25

So your point -- it's been slow, but

You're saying when you sue under the Death on
the High Seas Act there's a specific provision, section 4,

that tells you whenever a right of action is granted by

2

the law of a foreign State, you can sue on that one, so a

3

person who doesn't mention that is a person who is deemed

4

to have forgotten by that one -- forget it, cut it out --

5

and therefore wants American law to apply.

6

MR. HARAKAS:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. HARAKAS:

9

You have the option --

Is that --- under the Death on the High

Seas Act.
QUESTION:

10

You have your option, but you have to

11

state what your option is, and unless they refer to

12

section 4, they must be taking the American option.

13

MR. HARAKAS:

14

QUESTION:

15

That's correct.

That's your point. I've got it.

Thank you.

16

MR. HARAKAS:

Thank you, Your Honors.

17

The only other point that I just want to stress

18

here is that in developing this law in this case, I think

19

this case is very similar to the Higginbotham case, where

20

the Court was faced with the same question that the Second

21

Circuit faced.

22

under DOHSA, or the law developed by the Court in Gaudet,

23

and in Higginbotham the Court said, you cannot use Gaudet

24

to allow loss of society damages where the Death on the

25

High Seas Act applies.

Do you apply the law chosen by Congress

All those precedents following Higginbotham and

1

2

Miles show the restrictive nature of the Gaudet remedy,

3

and in fact Gaudet has been limited specifically to its

4

facts with respect to, it only applies in territorial

5

waters, and it only applies to longshoremen.
The Second Circuit didn't address that issue in

6

7

looking to Gaudet, and just adopted Gaudet as a general

8

representation of maritime law today, and I think the

9

Second Circuit was incorrect in approaching the issue in

10

that manner.
QUESTION:

11

But you -- but if I understand your

12

argument correctly, you do say there should be one uniform

13

Federal rule that applies not only to high seas but to

14

territorial waters and to accidents over land, and if

15

that's so,

16

be -- if there is a uniform law, why we aren't free to

17

choose between the alternatives.

18

MR. HARAKAS:

I just don't quite understand why that should

Well, I'm saying in our particular

19

case, I don't think we have to go any further than just

20

looking to the context of our case in DOHSA, but if the

21

Court is concerned with the uniformity issue, I think

22

there is room to develop a uniform rule, but I don't think

23

we -- in the context of our case we have to go any further

24

than DOHSA --

then we might have a lot of different

alternatives to apply.

MR. HARAKAS:

Right.
And then when you're looking to

the rule of what should be the uniform rule, you should

look first to the Federal statute to see is there a

directly applicable statute,

and even when there isn't a

is there a policy in similar

It's pecuniary

QUESTION:

2

Do I remember the Second Circuit case

3

in this decision, this case correctly in that the Second

4

Circuit, wrong or right, was saying that in these

5

international air disasters, when they come into U.S.

6

courts and you apply the provision of the treaty that

7

says, local law applies, the Second Circuit thought that

8

that ought to be one local law whether the crash occurred

9

in Scotland on land, in the Sea of Japan, or over

10

California?

11

not?

12

3
14

5

That was the Second Circuit's view, was it

MR. HARAKAS:

Yes, Your Honor, it was, and

that's where I think they ran into trouble in trying to
find what this uniform law is, and they adopted -QUESTION:

Well, they didn't.

They thought the

6

general maritime law, as declared in Gaudet, was a very

7

fine reference.

8
9

MR. HARAKAS:

That's what they did look to, but

I think you have to -- when you're applying and looking

20

for Federal law, it's just the general maritime law

21

doesn't have a life of its own.

22

I think the Court's decisions in Miles and

23

Moragne showed us that the general maritime law is derived

24

from the maritime statutes.

25

many statutes out there, we have to look at those statutes

Because today there are so

1

for guidance, and those statutes direct the court and

2

control the latitude that a court has in fashioning a

3

remedy or recognizing a remedy, and I don't think the

4

Second Circuit took those considerations into account.

5

They viewed general maritime law as something separate and

6

distinct from those maritime statutes.

QUESTION:

May I -- are you finished with

your -- may I ask this question?

9

It just --we think --we tend to think of

10

international air crashes like this as almost always

11

occurring over the high seas, because of all the

12

international flights, but at the time the convention was

13

adopted, is it not true that the typical case would be one

14

flying between different countries, and the action would

15

be most apt to occur over land?

16

MR. HARAKAS:

Within Europe, that would be true,

17

but beyond that I think the drafters noted the issue --

18

they foresaw, because Lindbergh had just crossed the

Atlantic in 1927 --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF W. PAUL NEEDHAM

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS/RESPONDENTS

ZICHERMAN, ET AL.

5

MR. NEEDHAM:

6

Mr. Chief Justice,

7

The United States signed the Warsaw Convention.

8

Thank you.
and may it please the Court:

They are treaty-bound to follow that convention.

9

One of the fundamental purposes of that

10

convention was to deter wilful misconduct.

11

there has been a finding of wilful misconduct.

12

In this case,

At the time that the Death on the High Seas Act

13

was passed into law,

14

There was no cap of any kind, and in this particular case,

15

when,

But the people who are guilty of the

wilful misconduct were the flight crew, weren't they?

19
20

there was no contemplation of a cap.

MR. NEEDHAM:

Well,

the flight crew,

and that

gets imputed to Korean Air Lines, which is the defendant.

21

QUESTION:

Yes, but the flight crew,

I suppose

22

they have a pretty good deterrent whatever the damages

23

are.

Convention was to put a lid on the damages, wasn't that

2

the main purpose of it, so that the then-infant industry

3

would be able to grow up?

4

MR. NEEDHAM:

That's absolutely true, but even

5

then, they said no lid when there's wilful misconduct, so

6

as concerned as they were then about judgments --

7

QUESTION:

Yes, well,

I thought the purpose was

8

rather to put a lid on damages but, when the conduct was

9

so bad, they were going to allow it to be handled the way

10

11
12

tort litigation was handled generally.
MR. NEEDHAM:

And that -- that is this case,

Your Honor, and in this case, to award loss of society,

3

and we believe that Federal common law is correct, we

4

believe loss of society is there in Federal common law,

5

and we believe to attach a financial dependency

6

requirement to loss of society is inappropriate.

7

The love and affection and mutual benefit you

8

have in a family does not depend on how much money changes

9

hands, and we disagree with the financial dependency --

20

QUESTION:

Counsel, I have one question.

I hate

21

to ask at the last minute, but the complaint had Count I,

22

a suit under the Warsaw Convention, Count II, a suit under

23

the Death on the High Seas Act, in which it asserts that

Korean law is applicable.
