ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD T. BERGERSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BERGERSON:

10

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
In 1984, after 10 years of careful study,

11
12

Congress responded to growing criticism of Federal

13

criminal justice systems by creating the United States

14

Sentencing Commission.

15

eliminate unpredictable, unequal, and unfair sentences

16

which had marred Federal criminal law for decades.

17

The task of the commission was to

To achieve this goal, the commission was vested

18

with broad factfinding resources, staffed with jurists and

19

leading experts in the sentencing field, and structured to

20

interact symbiotically with the courts and other branches

21

of Government so as to evolve predictable and

22

proportionate sentencing practices throughout the Federal

23

courts.

24
25

This case offers this Court an opportunity to
define the role of the commission in such a way as to

fulfill the express intentions of the Congress which
created it.
‘
in 1989.

Meirl Neal was convicted of trafficking -in LSD
Section 841(b) of title 21 requires a mandatory .

1'0-year penalty for trafficking in 10 or more'grams of a
mixture of LSD.

At the time Mr. Neal was sentenced,

neither the sentencing guideline nor the code contained a
definition of the term, mixture.
In this case, and under the rule later announced
by this Court in Chapman v. United States, the relevant
mixture was held to consist of the blotter paper onto
which the LSD was placed for purposes of sale and
distribution.

Under this definition, Mr. Neal received a

sentence of 16 years imprisonment.
Four years after Mr. Neal was sentenced, the
Sentencing Commission conducted hearings on whether the
sentencing practice used in his case could be reconciled
with section 841.

The hearing was required under the

commission's 1984 enabling legislation which chartered it
and made numerous reference to its absolute and abiding
duty to eliminate unwarranted sentencing disparities in
Federal criminal cases.
Congress equipped the commission with numerous
tools to achieve this result.

This-.Court in Chapman held that

'in answer to the question of whether/ to include blotter

paper in the weighing of LSD, in answer to the specific

8

question, does mixture or substance refer to pure LSD,

9

this Court held that one must include the blotter paper

10

because Congress adopted a market-oriented approach for

11

purposes of sentencing under 841.

12

The commission has, after thorough exploration,

13

factfinding and hearings, reinterpreted the term mixture

in light of the realities of the market.

interpreted it as in Chapman?

QUESTION:

MR. BERGERSON:

There was language in Chapman

which was not necessary to the resolution or solution of
the case which said that all the blotter paper should be
weighed.

that it could be modified to.reflect something less than
full weight?
-

--MR. BERGERSON:

No.In- Chapman, the issue

before the Court was whether the phrase, mixture or
substance, ’referred to pure LSD’.

The commission ’had not

yet spoken .to the issue, nor had any other agency, nor had
Congress spoken, and the term had no fixed common law
meaning.

Accordingly, the Court was obligated to use the

plain meaning of the word.
What we are arguing in this case is that the
plain meaning of the word has changed in light of the
commission's thorough factual exploration into what that
plain meaning -QUESTION:

And the meaning couldn't be plain.

If the meaning was plain, it wouldn't have changed.
MR. BERGERSON:

Well, but the meaning can change

in the context of the statute, because the statute refers
to the drug market.
QUESTION:

Well --

MR. BERGERSON:

And that's what the commission

studied, was the drug market.
QUESTION:

Well, what if in a totally different

context this Court had said we take the plain meaning of
the word employee, in a case that Justice Breyer wrote for
the Court a few weeks ago, and then a great convention of

lexicographers came along and said, well, we really want
to get to the bottom of this thing, and we now think that
employee means something different, could the next party
come along and say, well, this case should be modified
because you are wrong in deciding what employee meant?'
MR. BERGERSON: . No, because there is no
congressionally delegated convention of lexicographers
tasked with precisely the task that you've outlined in
your hypothetical.
QUESTION:

But Congress could do that.

That's

the only thing lacking, really, right?

Congress can have

this Court second-guessed all the time.

All it has to do

is designate a particular convention of lexicographers,
just as here it designated a certain aggregation of judges
and scholars who could be commissioners.
MR. BERGERSON:

If Congress designated a

convention of lexicographers with the same thoroughness as
it did -QUESTION:

Right.

MR. BERGERSON:

-- the Sentencing Commission,

then the answer would be yes.
QUESTION:

Gee, I feel a lot less important than

I did before.

decided cases, isn't it, that another body could in effect
overrule our decisions?

In fact, it's contrary to that

case back in 1790, the pension .case.
MR. BERGERSON:

_•

-•

,;-

Your Honor, this is not a case

of stare decisis, and those cases all deal ’with' 'stare'
decisis, and it's not a case of stare decisis for two
reasons.

First, the language in Chapman which is

problematic here, the language which talks about weighing
all the blotter paper, was not necessary for the
resolution of the Chapman case because the question
presented in Chapman was simply answered by saying that
the mixture includes blotter paper.
QUESTION:

Did the length of the sentence in

Chapman depend on the actual weight, including the weight
of the blotter paper?
MR. BERGERSON:
QUESTION:

Yes or no.

MR. BERGERSON:
the statute did.

What was at issue in Chapman --

The length of the sentence under

The guideline sentence in Chapman was

not directly challenged.

It was simply tracking along

with the mandatory -QUESTION:

So that the answer is yes, the

sentence depended on the actual weight of the mixture or
substance.

QUESTION:

Did it exercise that power, assuming

it had it? .

_>

-♦

I mean, what's stopping me in this at the moment

5

is it says, nonetheless this approach does not override

6

the applicability of mixture or substance for the purpose

7

of applying any mandatory minimum sentence, and then it

8

cites Chapman, and then it cites 5Gl.l(b), and in 5Gl.l(b)

9

it says, when a statutory minimum sentence is greater than

10
11

the maximum guideline, apply the statutory minimum.
Now, I know you could find some ambiguity in

12

that, but it's hard to find more than ambiguity, and what

13

it sounds as if they're saying is, we're changing it for

14

purposes of the guideline, but the mandatory minimum in

15

the statute of course trumps the guideline, and there's

16

nothing here that suggests we're changing that in any way.

17

18

point of view.

I would respectfully disagree

20

with that interpretation.

First of all, it is proclaiming that the

It does not

1

override the statute for purposes of setting a mandatory

2

minimum.

3

Second, 'in light of the 1 history, as I've

4

outlined in my reply brief, of this amendment, the

5

commission is simply proclaiming the process by which it

6

reached its result.

7

QUESTION:

But if I were on the commission and

8

were doing this thing, which is pretty radical, trying to

9

change a case of the Supreme Court, interpreting a statute

10

of Congress, which I can't remember an instance where the

11

commission would try to do that, wouldn't the commission

12

at least tell people what they were trying to do and

13

explain it, rather than putting a sentence in the

14

guideline that implies to an ordinary reading the

15

contrary?

16

MR. BERGERSON:

Well, the sentence is in the

17

commentary to the guideline, and to the degree that it's

18

inconsistent with the guideline it's not binding on this

19

Court under this Court's Stinson decision, but my

20

submission would be that the guideline is plain enough and

21

the delegation to the commission to do what it did is

22

plain enough that the commission need not have said

23

anything, and simply proclaiming that it is trying to be

24

consistent with section 841 and this Court's reasoning in

25

Chapman is nothing more than the commission's own

Congress is, they don't make these numbers up.

What they

11

do is, they go to experts, particularly DEA, and they say

12

to DEA, what should we do here to get our intent, so there

13

was at some point some representation from DEA to Congress

14

that would have told them how technically to write a

15

statute that's going to achieve a particular objective.
But the particular objective was to put big guys

16
17

and big deal gangs in jail for 5 years or 10 years, 5

18

years medium, and less than 5 years, itty-bitty, all

right.

20

Now, what is the definition of this?

Did

21

Congress have in mind that a fairly big-sized expert, or

22

drug guy, or LSD guy was a person with 125 doses, or a

23

person that was trying to sell 2,500?

found out from DEA and there would have been pamphlets,

MR. BERGERSON:

In the Chapman dissent there is

7

a footnote, footnote 12, which indicates that if you strip

8

away the paper, then the doses become equivalent for all

9

the drugs listed in section 841(b).

That led the arguers

10

in Chapman to believe that it was likely that Congress

11

simply did not take into account the paper, but that issue

12

has been decided.

13

What we're saying now is that the DEA had equal

14

input into the commission's definition, and that the

15

commission's definition was done with reference to all the

16

provisions of the statute.

17

QUESTION:

Yes, but this is quite later.

At the

18

time that this statute was passed, the DEA was going and

19

telling the commission and Congress about the same thing

20

as to how to write it, and so what I'm trying to figure

21

out is, there must be a manual or something somewhere that

22

refers us to whether it's 125 doses that looks -- defines

23

a fairly big guy, or 2,500 doses.

24

and what is it?

That's the key to this,

What matters is whether you're trying to put the 125-dose

You can have any kind of weighing system you

want, do it in a thousand different ways, but what's the

10

MR. BERGERSON:

In answer to Your Honor's

11

question, the DEA did not provide input to Congress on the

12

question that Your Honor has asked.

13

to Congress on the precise weight of pure LSD.

14

The DEA provided data

However, if one looks at the statute and

15

construes it as a whole in accordance with the

16

jurisprudence of this Court, it is clear that Congress

17

intended to punish these drugs in pari materia.

18

The relevant language of the statute is not

19

simply mixture or substance, but all the other references,

20

to 10 years, different doses, different quantities,

21

absolute quantities of drugs that yield roughly equivalent

22

doses, and one assumes that the commission was correct in

23

interpreting the statute to mean that what Congress wanted

24

was to go and have LSD punished at roughly the same level

25

as the other drugs.

I would clarify it to say the Sentencing

the binding that takes place in a matter of degree is that

portion of the paper that should count, because they would

Now, I guess in that sense the commission, while

it couldn't legally bind the courts, could tell the courts

some information that might be relevant to them in

hour, and which we've been talking about since the Chapman

2

case.

3

The place is to inform the courts of the

4

realities of criminal sentencing, and that's why this case

5

is before this Court now.
The commission recognized in this case by a

6

7

factual finding of great quality and depth that the

8

sentencing in LSD cases was irrational and not consistent

9

with the statute as it interpreted as a whole, but more

10

than that, it defined the reality of what mixture or

11

substance containing LSD means in accordance with the

12

market realities of 841.

13

this Court, and it said it wasn't doing so, but it did

14

give a new plain meaning to the word.

It didn't purport to overrule

This Court recognized that the commission had

15
16

precisely this place in the scheme of things.

17

asking the Court to do is to allow the commission to do

18

here what the commission does all the time, which is to

19

establish binding guidelines for sentencing in criminal

20

cases.

21

What we're

Our position is that .4 milligrams of LSD is a

22

mixture or substance containing LSD within the meaning of

23

section 841(b) in light of the realities, and that under

24

this Court's jurisprudence, deference should be paid to

25

what the commission has done.
