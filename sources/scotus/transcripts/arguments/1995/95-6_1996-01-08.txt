ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

This case involves the proper interpretation of

12

section 2 of the Safety Appliance Act, which is quoted on

13

page 2 of the petitioner's brief, and which states that it

14

shall be unlawful for a railroad to use on its line --

15

excuse me -- any car not equipped with couplers coupling

16

automatically by impact, and which can be uncoupled

17

without the necessity of men going between the ends of the

18

cars.

19

In this case the respondent, a switchman at the

20

rail yard in St. Louis, Missouri, injured his back while

21

attempting to pull a drawbar into alignment that had

22

become misaligned almost certainly as a consequence of

23

having been disconnected from a prior car on a curve.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, was the drawbar

technology essentially the same at the time the statute

i

was enacted as it is today?
MR. PHILLIPS:

2

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

I don't

3

think there's much in the way of a significant advance

4

since 1893.
QUESTION:

5

And so at the time that the statute

6

we're reviewing was adopted, it was necessary for the

7

drawbar to be physically adjusted at times between the

8

cars.

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, I believe

10

that's correct.

11

case, that if you accept the notion that any misaligned

12

drawbar violates the Safety Appliance Act, then every

13

railroad has been in noncompliance with that act since

14

1898 when it went into effect, which means that every

15

railroad has been subject since 1898 to $100 fines for

16

every such violation, which might have actually saved the

17

Federal Government its budget problems today, but clearly

18

would have done so on the back of the railroads in ways I

19

don't think Congress intended.

20

As the D.C. Circuit said in the Lewis

What we have here is an injury that falls far

21

afield from what Congress had in mind in 1893 when it

22

acted to protect railroad workers from the possibility of

23

being crushed between railroad cars as a consequence of

24

the old-fashioned link and coupling devices used.

25

QUESTION:

Could you just refresh my memory?

If

the employee doesn't recover in this suit, what recovery

2

does he have?

3

Is there a workmen's compensation scheme?

MR. PHILLIPS:

There's the Federal Employers'

4

Liability Act that would have been available to him had he

5

chosen to bring that action.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

That, of course --

Can he still bring that action?
I would assume at this stage it's

8

too late, that the statute of limitations would have run.

9

It seems to me it was a conscious choice by the employee

10

in this case to bring this action exclusively under the

11

Safety Appliance Act and to do so to obtain the benefits

12

under State law, the --

13
14

QUESTION:

Do you have to show some negligence

under FELA?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

He would have to show some

16

negligence under FELA, and respondent has steadfastly

17

avoided any effort to attempt to do that in this case.

18

QUESTION:

So, if there's an on-the-job injury

IS

with no negligence, is there ever a workmen's compensation

20

scheme?
MR. PHILLIPS:

21

Not to my knowledge, no, Your

22

Honor.

23

that stands out in this particular way.

24
25

The required negligence -- it's the only scheme

On the other hand, of course, unlike most
workers' compensation schemes, where there is a fairly

As a consequence of that, employees

The Jones Act picks up on the same

So, it's for seamen as well as railroad workers.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

that's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

8

9

QUESTION:

The seamen have the same --

You mentioned the Lewis case and as

far as fines are concerned, you're certainly right, but

10

what do you make of this statement in Lewis that the

11

railroad's duty is, as far as the worker is concerned and

12

the worker's injury -- it's a duty not just to provide

13

proper equipment, but to guarantee its performance.

14

seems to say the -- there can be no fine against the

15

railroad but there is a guarantee to the worker.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

That

I guess I would have two

17

responses to that, Justice Ginsburg.

18

the extent that that suggests that there might be some

19

potential claim as a matter of negligence or even a claim

20

under the Safety Appliance Act where the only evidence is

21

a malfunction and no evidence put forward by the railroad

22

as to why the malfunction occurred, that is, to show that

23

-- simply a case of a misaligned drawbar or an unopened

24

knuckle -- sure, there could be recovery under those

25

circumstances, although I wouldn't expect that to happen

First, I think to

very often.
The alternative, though, is it's difficult to
3

square the broader understanding of that language with the

4

statutory scheme because it's reasonably clear to me that

in order to recover under - - through FELA for a Safety

simply because you end up ultimately obtaining your

You cannot stretch the Safety Appliance

10

recompense through FELA as a technical matter.

11

to me you'd have to conclude that a misaligned drawbar is

12

a violation of section 2.

13

QUESTION:

It seems

Are you saying politely that Judge

14

MacKinnon was incorrect to the extent that he said that

15

the -- that there is a guarantee of the performance?

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think you can justify that

17

statement in the very limited sense in which this Court

18

has in the past recognized that if all the proof you have

IS

is a malfunction and nothing else comes in, there could be

20

liability under those circumstances.

21

that's what his statement means, I don't have any quarrel

22

with it.

23

To the extent that

To the extent he goes beyond that, you're right,

24

Justice Ginsburg.

didn't agree with him.

Well, you say that if there's just a

malfunction and no evidence produced on the part of the

railroad, there could be liability.

theory or the explanation of liability there?

5
6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Why would there be liability in

that situation?

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

What would be the

Yes.
Well, this Court's decisions

suggest that there are essentially two ways to demonstrate

10

a violation of the Safety Appliance Act:

11

been a malfunction of the coupler or there has been a

12

defect in the coupler.

13

either there has

In the malfunctioning situation, what the Court

14

says is, we will presume, if it malfunctioned, that it had

15

something to do with an equipment failure.

16

But what the Court said quite plainly in

17

Affolder was that that presumes in the first instance that

18

the couplers were set to operate normally, and if the

19

couplers were not set, in that case by the way, opening of

20

the knuckle -- in our case I submit by way of aligning the

21

drawbar so that the knuckles would in fact connect -- then

22

it seems to me, as the Court said in Affolder, we would

23

have a good defense under that circumstance.

24
25

So, really the way the particular problem arises
simply is a technical kind of pleading problem.

If there

That's correct, Mr.

We have no malfunction and we have no defect.

close.

defies the language of that statute.

That

this is not

a statute that imposes operational restrictions on how

3

railroads go about their business.

4

about going between two cars does is fairly describe the

5

type of coupler that Congress meant to require in 1893.

6

And a little bit of history here goes a long way to giving

7

content to that particular phrase.

8
9

What the language

What we knew at the time was that in 1893
automatic couplers were fairly new to the scene, and

10

Congress did not want to mandate any particular type of

11

coupling and uncoupling mechanism.

12

describe the type of a device that it wanted implemented

13

by 1898, and therefore what the -- as the Court again in

14

the D.C. Circuit said in the Lewis case, what we know is

15

that that independent requirement about going between cars

16

is not itself an independent prohibition under the act.

17

It simply wanted to

Part of the reason we know that it can't be

18

really a significant independent requirement under the act

19

is it doesn't even modify, by its own terms,

20

coupling.

21

Now,

the fact of

this Court has applied that language to the

22

coupling as a reasonable,

probably Congress'
