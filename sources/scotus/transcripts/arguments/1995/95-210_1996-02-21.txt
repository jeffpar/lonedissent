ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES P. ROBERTS, III

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
During the 200-plus years of our country's

12

history, agriculture has undoubtedly changed dramatically.

13

Over the years, it has become more mechanized, more

14

specialized, and a much larger business.

15

here today in 1996 before this Court, the process of

16

catching chickens remains one of the most rudimentary

17

agricultural processes that one can visualize.

18

using nothing but their two hands manually catch chickens

19

and place them into cages in order that these chickens can

20

be delivered to market.

21

Yet, as I stand

Workers

One would not think that it would take much

22

analysis to conclude that these workers are agricultural

23

laborers, yet the parties, including us, spend pages and

24

pages of our briefs discussing whether Holly Farms is a

25

farmer when it sends its chicken -- sends its live haul

1

crews to the farms of the independent growers.

2

We spend pages discussing whether catching

3

chickens is -- or whether chickens can be harvested.

4

spend pages discussing whether the live haul crews are

5

acting in some way in a relationship with the processing

6

plant, perhaps proving that lawyers and sometimes judges

7

can make issues that are quite simple seem complex.

Fortunately,

I don't have to rely on common

sense here today, because we have a statute that Congress

(Laughter.)

15

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor.

I think in this

16

case we see that common sense does equate with what

17

Congress has done.

18

a common sense argument.

19

We

I just wouldn't want to be making only

However, what we have is a statute -- and if

20

nothing else from my argument becomes clear today,

21

it will be clear that the chicken catchers and the

22

forklift operators are at a minimum engaged in secondary

23

agriculture within the meaning of section 3(f).

I hope

That

MR. ROBERTS:

1

Well,

I think the truck drivers

2

are a much more difficult question.

I think that the

3

issue there turns on whether Holly is a farmer, because

4

their activities do not take place on a farm.
I think logically it makes more sense to address

5
6

the chicken catchers and the forklift operators first,

7

because the issue in our opinion is much clearer on those,

8

and if we prevail on the chicken catchers and the forklift

9

operators then, even if we lose on the live haul drivers,

10

that undermines the board's bargaining unit.
QUESTION:

11

But can we see them -- can we solve

12

this case by just thinking of chicken catchers without

13

knowing the employer involved?

14

Now, suppose Holly Farms didn't ever hatch any

15

chickens.

It was only in the slaughtering and processing

16

business.

So it goes to the farms, it sends its trucks

17

and teams to the farms, they pick up the chickens, they

18

haul them to the slaughterhouse or the processing plant,

19

and they don't -- they're not even in the farming business

20

at all.

21

processing.

22

They just pick up the chicks for slaughter and

MR. ROBERTS:

And if those were the facts, the

23

chicken catchers and forklift operators would still be

24

agricultural laborers, but the live haul drivers would not

25

be agricultural laborers in our opinion, under the facts

that you have posed.
How do we know that?

3

We can look at the statute

itself, which is found at page 3 of the blue brief.
QUESTION:

4

Well, you rely on the fact that the

5

chicken catchers and the people who put them in cages are

6

doing the work on the farm.
MR. ROBERTS:

7
8

QUESTION:

And therefore under the secondary

agriculture prong of that statute.
MR. ROBERTS:

11

12

We

think --

9
10

That's correct, Your Honor.

That's our position, is that at a

minimum, while we contend --

13

QUESTION:

And you take the position that

14

Bayside, that Bayside case did not deal with that aspect

15

of the statute, where the work was done on the farm.

16

MR. ROBERTS:

That's absolutely correct, Your

17

Honor.

18

was no contention in that case that their work was

19

performed on a farm, so the sole issue was whether Bayside

20

was a farmer, which also applies to our --we concede that

21

that applies to our live haul drivers, but not to the

22

chicken catchers.

23

Bayside dealt with feed haul drivers, and there

QUESTION:

Okay, and so as far as the driver is

24

concerned, we would have to conclude that Holly Farms has

25

regained its status as a farmer for you to prevail as to

1

them.
MR. ROBERTS:

2

We believe that that's the correct

3

analysis, Your Honor,

4

and the forklift operators and we look at the statute,

5

which is on page 3 of the blue brief,

6

includes,

7

any practices performed by a farmer or on a farm as an

8

incident to or in conjunction with such farming

9

operations,

among other things,

it says agriculture

the raising of poultry, and

including preparation for market.

Now,

10

but if we take the chicken catchers

we know that the chicken catchers and

11

forklift operators work on a farm, because that is

12

conceded.

13

live chickens constitutes preparation for market because

14

the board really does not dispute that, and the Secretary

15

of Labor has specifically defined those tasks as being

16

preparation for market.

17

We also know that catching,

caging,

and loading

We also know that the activities of the chicken

18

catchers and the forklift operators are incidental to

19

farming because section 3(f)

20

preparation for market is an activity that is, per se,

21

incidental to farming.

22

specifically states that

The only remaining question is,

is it related,

23

incidental to or in conjunction with such farming, and we

24

know that the answer to that question is yes, because the

25

chickens that are caught,

caged,

and loaded onto the

1

trucks are the same chickens that are raised on the farms

2

on which the truck drivers work, so under the plain

3

language of section 3(f), it is clear that the chicken

4

catchers and forklift operators at a minimum meet the

5

secondary definition of agriculture.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, one could accept that

7

that's a perfectly reasonable reading of the statute, but

8

isn't there some respect that we owe to the contrary

9

interpretation of the NLRB and its ruling in this case?

10

MR. ROBERTS:

We don't believe that in this case

11

the board's opinion is entitled to any deference on the

12

chicken catchers and forklift operators, because the issue

13

in our view is that that's the only reasonable

14

interpretation of section 3(f).

15

We also contend that the board's interpretation

16

of phrases such as incidental to farming operations is

17

contrary to this Court's prior decisions in Maneja and

18

Farmers Reservoir, so we think that there's a principle of

19

stare decisis that applies here, too.

20

We also take the position that their

21

interpretation is contrary to the Secretary of Labor's, so

22

for a variety of reasons we think that the board's

23

interpretation in this case is contrary to the plain

24

language of the statute and not reasonable.

I'm referring right now to the chicken catchers

and the forklift operators.

2

analytically they are separate from the live haul drivers,

3

and that the two groups do not necessarily rise or fall

4

together.
QUESTION:

5

I must emphasize that

Yes, and would you be able to say the

6

same thing with respect to the line haul drivers, that

7

that is your interpretation is the only reasonable one?

8

MR. ROBERTS:

9

QUESTION:

It's hard to say that, isn't it?

MR. ROBERTS:

10

We don't --

Our position on the live haul

11

drivers is that the statute is not specifically ambiguous

12

but it does require interpretation and, had the board made

13

a choice in this case between Holly and the independent

14

grower, that choice might have been entitled to

15

reference -- I mean, to deference.

16

But what's happened in this case is, unlike

17

Bayside, where the board took the position that the

18

independent grower was the relevant farmer, the board

19

denies in this case that the independent grower is the

20

farmer.

21

Farms is the farmer, so what we have is the inescapable

22

conclusion that these chickens, which are still on the

23

farm, have no farmer, and that's the basis for our

24

argument, is that --

25

It takes the -- and it also denies that Holly

Not necessarily, because Holly,

12

or they can be acting incidentally to Holly's farming

It's our position that they're doing both.

We think that that is one

possibility that, you know, could be argued, but the

problem is --

4

QUESTION:

Well, why isn't that same possibility

open to the chicken catchers?

Because the statute, Your Honor,

7

specifically defines preparation for market of

8

agricultural commodities raised on that farm as being

incidental.

QUESTION:

10

No question about that, but this --

11

doesn't this go to the point of incidental to such

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

It --

And I mean, there is at least a

15

reasonable position, isn't there, to the effect that if

16

the chicken catcher is hired by a slaughterer as opposed

17

to being hired by the farmer, the one who literally owns

18

the henhouse with the chickens in it, that that would be a

19

reason for saying it is not incidental to such farming, it

20

is incidental to slaughtering?

21

I mean, that's a possible position, isn't it?

22

MR. ROBERTS:

We don't think that under any

23

reasonable interpretation, because what that -- if you

24

adopt that interpretation, then it leads to the conclusion

Well,

possibility in play, and that is the possibility that when

the person who hires and sends the chicken catcher is

neither the farmer, nor an independent, but a slaughterer,

and the work is being done as a preparation for the

slaughterer's slaughtering, that in fact the incidental

character goes to slaughtering and not to farming.

reasonable interpretation, Your Honor, that Congress -- we

don't think that was Congress' intent.

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, because the language

2

employed by the slaughterers.
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, the interpretation that you

3

pose is one posed in the board's brief, but it was not

4

posed by the board in its decision, and it's directly

5

contrary to the board's decision in Produce Magic, where

6

the board held that an independent harvester who went from

7

farm to farm providing services for lettuce growers was

8

not an agricultural laborer, even though the work was

9

performed on a farm, because he wasn't a farmer.

10

So the board has read the statute in a manner

11

which prevents anybody other than a farmer from ever

12

performing secondary activities.

13

QUESTION:

But the point is, the statute can be

14

read in a way that does not have that effect and still

15

lead to the board's conclusion here.

16

MR. ROBERTS:

Only by adopting a logic that is

17

specifically contrary to what the board has held in

18

another case, and we don't think that that would be a

19

reasonable method for doing it.

21

proposition that a particular activity can only be

3

QUESTION:

All the statute requires is that it

be incidental to the farming operation.
MR. ROBERTS:

The board has effectively imposed

4

a solely or exclusively requirement into section 3(f)

5

which is not warranted by the act.

6

If you look at the court's decision in the sugar

7

cane case in Hawaii, Maneja, where they specifically dealt

8

with railroad workers who transported sugar cane from the

9

fields to the processing mill, the court clearly viewed

10

that activity as being incidental to farming even though

11

the purpose and the ultimate destination of the sugar cane

12

was the employer's processing mill where the sugar cane

13

was going to be processed into sugar and molasses.

14

So it seems clear from that decision that the

15

question of whether something is related to farming is not

16

a question of whether it has any relationship to

17

processing but how is it, and is it the kind of activity

18

that we would view as being reasonably related to the

19

farming operation.

20

QUESTION:

And I suppose that you'd have a real

21

problem with any farmer who has an integrated operation,

22

not only farms but slaughters, and then if these people

23

who catch his chickens are doing things that are

24

incidental to both operations, they presumably would not

25

be entitled to the exemption.

QUESTION:

3

Well, that's correct, Your Honor.

Which is just like the case you

describe.
MR. ROBERTS:

4

Well, I think that one problem

5

with the board's interpretation is it leads to a detailed

6

analysis of the business relationships between the

7

different employers, and we read section 3(f) as focusing

8

primarily on the nature of the work, and under the

9

board - QUESTION:

Suppose that you had -- suppose I go

11

into the business of supplying water to people who are

12

I live in the city, I get my water from the city

worker, is that right?

No, I don't think so, Justice

I'm sorry, Your Honor, I didn't --

Just as they are saying that he is

not the farmer, you are saying that he is.
MR. ROBERTS:

We're saying that both are.

We're

saying that you can be -- in this particular case, the

6

activities of all these workers can be incidental to both

Holly's farming operations and to the grower's farm --

8

it's -- remember, the statute speaks of the farms.

9

The operation, the farming operations that take

10

place on the farm, those operations were the grower's

11

operations in raising the chickens.

12

by definition, that's related to the farm's farming

activities.

That's the other issue.

We're

talking about the -MR. ROBERTS:

Our position, though, is, is that

18

in addition to that, Holly has resumed its status as a

19

farmer because it holds title to the chicks, it actually

20

performs the delivery, or the catching, the caging and the

21

delivery, and as the board points out in its brief, the

22

grower provides a service for Holly.

23

QUESTION:

Well, wait a minute.

If it was an

independent contractor who did the catching-caging, you

wouldn't say that he became a farmer, would you?

You'd

to farming on the farm.

3

MR. ROBERTS:

4

QUESTION:

Because that --

So the mere fact that Holly did the

catching-caging doesn't reconvert Holly to a farmer.

6

just means that Holly is doing work incidental to farming.

7

MR. ROBERTS:

It

Well, Your Honor, and the case you

pose would be one where the entity had no previous farming

9

status with regard to those chickens.

only distinction that you can rely on.

Honor, is that Holly owns the chickens.

The example you

2

pose would be one where the chickens were not owned by the

independent contractor, so they would have no relationship

whatsoever to these particular chickens.
So we think it is a material distinction that

MR. ROBERTS:

bears on the fact that it shows that the relationship that

Holly has to the chickens -- by itself, I would agree with

you that that would --

hatching of chicks.

MR. ROBERTS:

And it performs -- and another

11

argument that I've not really had time to address is that

actually harvesting the chickens within the regulations of

because under any scenario, as you see this case, the

chicken catchers and the forklift person have to be

agricultural laborers.

4

MR. ROBERTS:

Obviously, that is our position,

5

and it's our -- I would agree it's our strongest argument,

and that's why I keep emphasizing you have to separate the

two.

Analytically they are distinct, and if -- if the

It's the statutory language that

That's correct, and we -- but we

15

believe that in terms of determining whether an activity

16

is incidental to the primary farming operations that are

17

going on on a farm, it's important to determine whether

18

it's connected with some broader process.

19

In this case, the chicken-catching operations

20

are connected with the broader process of slaughtering and

21

dressing the chickens for market.

That's not a necessary premise of

The statute really asks only one question, and

10
11

that is whether the activity is incidental to the primary

farming operation, and that's the only question that has

to be answered.

We're saying the chicken catching and the

21

Anybody who's ever worked on a farm knows that.

your argument, or the argument of the board is just a real

Yes, but again I would go back to

focus on the particular farming operations that we're

We would say that the time spent on

both farms, on both kinds of farms would not be incidental

otherwise the same as they are in this case.

QUESTION:

And so then if

of their time doing this, the result would be that they

would be farm workers then, or not?

MR. SEAMON:

That they would not be farm workers

there, and again, it is because of the way in which this

The board's

Holly Farms owns some of these farms, their work would

still be part of the processing operation.

Again, we're simply relying in part on

they organize the work.

11

what you're saying?

12

that the farms owned by Holly Farms did not have any kind

You could say that it's incidental to such farming, and

MR. SEAMON:

That's right, or in that -All right.

Now -- now, that is a

little counterintuitive, because you'd think he's going

out there and picking up the chickens out of the thing the

6

same way each time, and you can't quite turn to the

7

contract on that, I don't think, because you can write the

contracts, or that same contract with any of the three and

you'd come to different results, and therefore it must

turn on something, and I take it you'd think it turns on

the deference that we owe somebody.
And so that's my question.

12

Who do we owe that

deference to, and exactly what?

that solves this under the FLSA, because I take it that

to, I guess, is what do the FLSA administrators think

about this, and I have some regulations, and they talk

about transporting plant employees, they talk about

about going into the coop and picking them out, or going

have they made it?
MR. SEAMON:

There are a series of regulations

of the Department of Labor that address this situation.

The basic regulation has specifically addressed the

MR. SEAMON:

That's quite possible, and this

MR. SEAMON:

QUESTION:

Isn't that right?
Yes, that's right.
So the question is whether catching a

4

chicken and putting him in a coop so he can be taken to

5

market is the equivalent of feeding hogs or not.
MR. SEAMON:

6

And I think it's clearly not,

7

because if a firm were engaged simply in the work of going

8

from farm to farm catching chickens, it wouldn't be

9

ordinary to call the person who owns that business a

10

11

farmer.
QUESTION:

All right, so if in fact the -- I

12

mean, you have to draw the line somewhere, and I guess

13

people would think that transporting the chicken, coming

14

and just taking the chicken and bringing it to the

15

processing factory, that's fair enough to call not

16

17

of feeding the hogs, because he's actually picking the

QUESTION:

7

MR. SEAMON:

Okay.
And it is quoted towards the bottom

8

of the page of our gray brief on the merits, page 27.

9

It's 29 C.F.R. 780.143, and it's block-quoted.
The fact that a practice performed on a farm is

10

11

not performed by or for a farmer is a strong indication

12

that it is not performed in connection with the farming

13

operations there conducted, and in order to decide whether

14

the work was done for a farmer -- as Justice O'Connor was

15

suggesting, in a sense, of course, the removal of chickens

16

is done for the farmer, but in certain cases it's more

17

accurate to say that it's done for the benefit of the

18

processor.

19

of the processing plant, the testimony of petitioner's own

20

witness calls the process --

At least that's true when the crew works out

QUESTION:

21

But again, it's probably done for

22

both.

23

in order to continue his business of growing more, and the

24

processor needs to get them in order to process them, and

25

they both benefit, and it's incidental to both.

The farmer needs to get rid of the mature pullets

MR. SEAMON:

1

Whether the -- we would say that

2

you have to look at some additional factors in that,

3

however, and one of them would include the fact that there

4

is a good reason why these chicken catching operations are

5

employees of the processor rather than employees of the

6

farmer.

The chicken processing operation --

7

QUESTION:

But under the statute, if it's on the

8

farm, it doesn't matter who the employer is if it's on the

9

farm and incidental to or in conjunction with such farming

10

operation.

That's all that's important.

11

the employer.
MR. SEAMON:

12

It's not who is

But the incidental-to requirement

13

requires you to look at the relationship between the

14

activity to be classified and the primary farming

15

operation that goes on on that farm, and in looking at the

16

relationship between those two activities, I would submit

17

you also have to look at the relationship between the

18

parties.

19

Are the same employees who are actually doing

20

the raising of the chickens also doing the catching of the

21

chickens?

22

between the two types of work, and it may very well be

23

relevant, because it is the farmer's employees who are

24

doing the catching, to say that is incidental to the

25

farming.

In that case, there's a very close correlation

QUESTION:

1

Well, it's crystal clear that the

2

language of the statute was included to bring in, for

3

instance, the independent thresher and so forth.

4

never contemplated that it had to be an employee of the

5

farmer.
MR. SEAMON:

6

It was

And that independent contractor is

7

described in the legislative history as limited to doing

8

nothing but going from farm to farm threshing wheat for

9

the farmer.

In that situation, the firm is working under

the direction of the farmer.

13

QUESTION:

Since by hypothesis it

But don't you suppose the farmer here

14

has to tell the chicken catchers the chickens that are

49 years old are in that particular area --

QUESTION:

Days old.

QUESTION:

-- or 49 days old --

(Laughter.)

19

QUESTION:

-- are in that particular area, those

20

are the ones you have to go catch, and you go in there and

21

get those?

22

MR. SEAMON:

The record doesn't make that clear.

23

In fact, the record doesn't indicate any interaction

24

whatsoever between the independent growers and the

25

chicken-catching crews, and that is one of the factors

that we believe is relevant.

QUESTION:

But Mr. Seamon, we assume they're not

going to show up at the farm and have the farmer just

QUESTION:

Watch out for the red one.

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

8

(Laughter.)

9

QUESTION:

Why -- it seems to me that this

10

brings us back to a question that Justice Scalia has posed

11

a couple of times.

12

Going to the reg on page 27, here are good

13

reasons to say,

in the abstract, or just looking to common

14

language usage,

that the chicken catcher in this case is

15

doing it for the farmer, and there are good reasons to say

16

that he's doing it for the processor, but what we've got

17

is a regulation here that says,

18

make the choice between those two possibilities, one of

19

the things you look at is who holds title to the chicken.

20

MR. SEAMON:

21

QUESTION:

if you want to know how to

That's right.
And why don't you -- I mean, why --

22

don't you have a fair argument saying,

23

have tie-breakers somewhere,

24

what they are,

25

look, we've got to

somebody's got to figure out

and this Department of Labor regulation has

and therefore defer to the

1

regulation, admitting that as a matter of language it

2

could go either way?
MR. SEAMON:

3

And certainly title is relevant,

4

and the Court could decide to make title a tie-breaker,

5

and the board --

6

QUESTION:

And we ought to defer to it.

7

QUESTION:

And you always assume that the tie

8

has to be broken.

It seems tome that your

9

acknowledgement that independent contractor's employees

10

when they engage in this business are engaging in

11

agriculture.

12

that you don't have to be incidental to one or the other,

13

you can be incidental to both.

14

It seems to me that acknowledgement admits

Surely those people, when they do that work, are

15

doing it incidentally to the independent contractor's

16

business of catching and cooping chickens.

17

doubt that it's incidental to his business, and there's

18

also no doubt that it is incidental to the farmer's

19

business.

20

acknowledges it.

21

You acknowledge that.

There's no

The Government

So, you know, just taking that one example, it's

22

clear that you can be incidental to both, so all of your

23

pains to demonstrate that it is incidental to the

24

processing business lead you nowhere.

25

admit it's incidental to processing, but it's also

incidental to farming.
QUESTION:

2

Is the purpose of the statute

3

relevant in respect to that,

mean --

if it's all right -- I

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

6

QUESTION:

That the -- nobody -- is there some

7

authority that -- I mean, the purpose of this statute is

8

to let employees organize, and you don't want to let them

9

organize where they just work for farmers because the

10

farmers didn't have the -- they were poorer.

They were

11

poorer, and that's why they didn't have to pay the labor

12

act wages either, or the FLSA wages.

13

and when somebody works for a big company, they're not

14

under any assumption they're poorer.

They were poorer,

15

I mean, that would be a -- does that come into

16

play anywhere in this -- I mean, is there some authority

17

that says we can't take into account the purpose of the

18

statute?

19

MR. SEAMON:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SEAMON:

May I answer?
Yes.
The purpose of the statute is

highly relevant.

24

of farmers and not processors.

Mr. Roberts, you have 3 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES P. ROBERTS, III

3
4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ROBERTS:

Just a couple of quick responses

5

on some of these regs which have been referred to.

6

ignored several that I think have to be interpreted in

7

conjunction with the ones that he cited.

8

9

In particular, section 780.150(k)

-- excuse me,

151(k), the Secretary of Labor defines the poultry,

10

hauling, grading, cooping and loading poultry are

11

operations that are incidental or that constitute

12

preparation for market.

13

He's

Also, 780.126, which is cited by this Court in

14

Bayside, specifically says that the activities of a

15

processor when performed on the farm, it envisions this

16

very situation we have here, where the processor has title

17

and is dealing with an independent grower, because this is

18

a very common arrangement.

19

employees can be engaged in secondary agriculture to the

20

extent that they are working on a farm.

21

It says that the processor's

So if that statute, if that regulation has any

22

meaning, then the board's position that it's incidental, I

23

mean, the processing argument could be made there, too.

24

it's always incidental to processing in some way if it's a

25

processor, yet this regulation clearly envisions that a

1

processor's employees who work on a farm can be engaged in

2

secondary agriculture.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ROBERTS:

Plus the case --

What was the number of that again?
Excuse me?

It's 780.126, plus the

5

case that's cited in there by the Secretary of Labor is

6

Johnston v. Cotton Producers, which is a Fifth Circuit

7

case, but it's cited with approval, and in that case, it

8

dealt with a retail store, which -- the leg speaks of

9

retail stores and processors in the same language.

10

At one time retail stores would hold title to

11

the chickens and then basically perform services for the

12

farmer, and they say in that case that, specifically that

13

chicken, a guy who caught chickens and loaded them on the

14

trucks was engaged in secondary agriculture to the extent

15

that his activities occurred on the farm, so the board's

16

position boils down to the fact that it simply -- that

17

it's going to Holly's processing operation, which is

18

inconsistent with this regulation, it's inconsistent with

19

Johnston, it's inconsistent with Maneja, in which the

20

destination of the sugar cane was the processing plant,

21

but that didn't deter the Court from saying that the

22

activities were incidental to farming.

23

So the board has just gone way beyond

24

interpret -- you know, reasonable interpretation of a

25

statute in saying that it can only be incidental to

6

Mr. Roberts, why do they debeak

I didn't know they did that.

MR. ROBERTS:

Why do they do

I think it's to actually -- they

don't take the whole beaks off.

8

9

for certain, but I think the purpose is to prevent them

They actually trim them

from harming themselves or each other in some way, that --

you know, with the beaks pecking each other, or attacking

each other, or something of that nature.

I don't have anything further.
