ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL BENDER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. BENDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In 1989, Congress enacted FIRREA, the Financial

12

Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act in an

13

attempt to deal with the calamity - - one might more

14

accurately say catastrophe -- that had befallen the

15

savings and loan or thrift industry in the United States

16

during the decade of the 1980's largely because of a rise

17

in interest rates at the beginning of the 1980's and then

18

because of the risks that S&L owners took in order to make

19

more money to deal with the losses that were caused by the

20

rise in interest rates.

21

S&L's are invested in - - were invested in long

22

term low interest things, mortgages.

23

interest rates go up their profit and loss picture tends

24

to go down if they're stuck with those long-term debts.

25

Primarily when

During that decade, about a sixth of all the

S&L's in the United States, about 500, had to either be

2

closed or absorbed into other S&L's because they were

insolvent, because they failed.

end of the eighties.

5

occurred in 1987 and 1988.

6

That accelerated at the

About half of those failures

The costs of that failure are enormous.

The

7

cost in money to the insurance fund -- which is in turn,

8

was in turn mostly financed by premiums that the banks had

9

to pay, and so when the insurance fund loses the banks

10

have to pay more premiums, and that spirals the losses --

11

the cost to the insurance fund was over $40 billion in

12

those closings.

13

The cost in public confidence in the industry is

14

probably even greater.

15

banks and what that can cause, and when large numbers of

16

institutes, one in six, have to start being closed, there

17

is an enormous problem of possibly failing public

18

confidence.

19

$1.3 trillion invested in S&L's, and S&L's in turn are

20

there because Congress put them there in order to help the

21

housing market, and the housing industry, and make housing

22

affordable.

backs some insolvent banks in order to prevent them from

2

failing.

Isn't that what this is all about?
MR. BENDER:

3

It's not clear who induced whom in

4

these transactions.

5

QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

6

QUESTION:

I thought they did it in order to

7

save the Congress from having to appropriate more money to

8

pay the depositors who would have lost money.
MR. BENDER:

9

They did it for a number of

10

reasons.

11

during the 1980's to close as few banks as possible and to

12

have them absorbed into other banks because the insurance

13

fund had a limited amount of money, and if that money runs

14

out, Congress either has to appropriate money, which it

15

has very rarely done, or the premiums have to be raised on

16

the insurances.

17

It was the policy of the Federal bank regulators

The fund is primarily funded by premiums that

18

the banks pay.

19

problem that you have of losses becomes even greater.

20

policy, then, was to try to keep the banks alive.

21

The banks have to pay more premiums.

QUESTION:

The

In any case, whoever induced whom by

22

doing what these banks did, the claims on the insurance

23

fund were drastically reduced.

24

respect to every one of these failing banks, I take it.

6

Yes.

They were reduced until -- the

problem in effect was deferred until FIRREA was passed.

7

MR. BENDER:

Well, the problem reappeared before

8

FIRREA was passed, because if one bank, if one S&L absorbs

9

another, which has happened in one of these three cases,

10

and the other two people came into the industry who hadn't

11

been in it before, and took over a failing thrift, they

then often take great risks.

eighties.

QUESTION:

17

MR. BENDER:

But one of -Don't assume that just because one

18

bank is absorbed by another that deals with the problem.

19

That's a way of putting the problem off.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

One of those risks was the object of

the contracts in these three cases.
MR. BENDER:

I want to talk about the contracts

23

in these three cases, but I think the right context to

24

talk about it in is the context of what Congress did and

25

why they did it in FIRREA and whether that amounted to a

What Congress did in 1989 to deal with -- to try

3

to deal with the crisis, they did a number of different

4

things.

enormous amount of money in the fund, $100 billion to try

6

to increase public confidence and make the money

7

available.
The thing they did that's most relevant, or

9

They, for example, for the first time invested an

directly relevant to this case, is, the reason banks

10

become insolvent is because they lack capital.

11

that's almost a truism.

12

regulators during the eighties had permitted banks to

13

continue to exist with zero or negative capital by

14

counting things like the goodwill involved in this case as

15

capital.

These banks that -- the

It's not capital, it's a fantasy.

16

I mean,

It's actually

17

a loss that's on the books of the bank you acquire, but

18

they -- you're right, that by -- the strategy was to not

19

close the banks, and in order to do that they permitted

20

them to count as capital things that were not capital.

21

That is a very risky situation, because --a number of

22

reasons.

The people who own those banks, if they have no

24

capital in them, having nothing to lose by taking risks.

things it did in FIRREA as a way of dealing with this was

No, go ahead.

event, I take it it is fair to say, was exactly the event

5

that the parties assumed might happen when they made their

6

contracts.

7
8

9

MR. BENDER:

Exactly.

Congress had changed

capital standards many times over the years.
QUESTION:

Doesn't that fact defeat the

10

Government's attempt to bring this case essentially under

11

the impossibility doctrine, because the impossibility

12

doctrine, if I understand it, assumes that the parties

13

assume that the event that did happen was not something

14

that was going to happen.

15

assumption that was false, whereas in this case, it seems

16

to me, each party had made the very assumption that turned

17

out to be true.

1

defense, I understand it, rests upon the assumption that

2

the act or event that makes it impossible to perform, and

3

hence excuses performance, is an act or event which each

4

party assumed would not happen, whereas in this case, each

5

party assumed that it might very well - MR. BENDER:

It might very well happen.

Mr. Bender, are you relying on

impossibility or unmistakability?
MR. BENDER:

We're relying on the fact that

there was no promise here - -

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. BENDER:

The unmistakability doctrine?
The unmistakability doctrine is a

14

doctrine of construction of a contract, and that

15

doctrine --we don't think that doctrine needs to be used

16

here at all.

17

to that in a second - - there is no promise such as the

18

plaintiffs say.

If you just read the contracts -- I'll get

are claiming.

The plaintiffs claim --

Well, may I -- just before you leave

the --my question is - - I take it your answer is yes,

we - - each side was assuming that this might very well

happen, and that was part of the object of contracting.

contracts should be read and are only sensibly read as not

making the promise that the plaintiffs say they make,

3

namely a promise that that wouldn't change.
QUESTION:

Well, no, it wasn't necessarily a

promise that that wouldn't change.

what would happen to these banks if it did change.
MR. BENDER:

It was a promise about

The promise that they allege is

8

either that Congress would not toughen capital

9

requirements to increase the required solvency, or that if

10

it did, these banks would be exempted from that, and the

11

issue in this case is whether there is a promise like

12

that.

13

QUESTION:

And you want to convince us that

14

these bankers and lawyers who signed this agreement put

15

themselves in a visibly insolvent state at a time when

16

there was clearly a crisis in the S&L industry and

17

Congress was clearly going to take some action, visibly

18

put themselves in an insolvent condition without any

19

commitment on the part of the Government to not count that

against them for purpose of shutting them down.

8

If the contract had had a clause

specifically allowing the Government to do what it's done

10

in this case, it is impossible for me to believe that the

11

parties would have entered into the transaction.
MR. BENDER:

12

13

I would look at that a different

way.

14

If it is so vital to these acquirers that they

15

be guaranteed that they can continue to count this capital

16

even though Congress changes the rules to require real

17

capital rather than phony capital, if it's so important to

18

them, you would think that they would get a promise to

19

that effect.

There is no promise here anything like that.

QUESTION:

Well, isn't that where the

unmistakability doctrine comes in, that people are not

doctrine is where -- what's the line as to where it

21

applies and where it doesn't?

22

applies if the Government promises to sell somebody 2 tons

23

of oil, and then what happens is an environmental reg

apply?
MR. BENDER:

I think it applies when somebody

12

suggests that Government officials have made a promise

that Congress will or will not regulate for the public

14

interest in a certain way.

15

It certainly applies when somebody says that

they will or will not regulate in things that have to do

with safety.

Well, wait, if the Government says --

Only in that situation.
No, there are two kinds of promises

that they are alleging, that they could allege that would

One is that Congress won't do it, and the other

is that if Congress did it, it would exempt them from the

11

and it doesn't surprise me.

12

QUESTION:

So, but --

13

QUESTION:

Isn't there a third possibility,

14

Mr. Bender, that even if they are not exempted in the

15

sense of being able to enforce their agreement

16

specifically to allow them to act contrary to the

17

regulation, isn't there a third possibility, and that is

18

that the risk of loss if that happens falls on the

Government, not on them, and that's why it seems to me

important that we're dealing with a damages action here

Are you arguing to any extent that

there was no authority in the executive branch to make

such an agreement, or are you saying, yes, they could make

MR. BENDER:

We are arguing that there was no

And even though mortgages are like, 30-year

it please the Court:
What Mr. Bender refers to and what his reply

hypothesized thrift which does not exist on this record.

not admissible.

19

doctrine, Mr. Hollingsworth, require a little bit

20

different focus on that?
I mean, as I understand the doctrine, it would

mean that even though, if you take the reasonable man

MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:

Mr. Chief Justice, the

2

unmistakability doctrine requires a clear promise, and

3

clear authority, and interpreting the clear promise, this

4

Court's precedents have held that the Court can look to

5

the plain meaning and can interpret the plain meaning of

6

what the parties intended from the language of the

7

contract and from the circumstances under which the

8

contract was made.

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Then what does the unmistakability

doctrine add to the ordinary law of contracts, then?
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:

It requires a clear promise,

12

a clear promise in a contract where you're dealing with

13

the Government where there is a regulatory promise at

14

issue, and of course --

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Does that rule out any promise by

implication?
MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:

No, it does not, Your Honor,

18

and if the Court refers to page 32 of our brief, the Court

19

will see the references to cases in which the course of

20

dealing with the parties is also used to construe the

21

plain meaning of the contract.

22

QUESTION:

Well --

23

MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:

Now, that may not be the

24

same as implication.

5

And the second thing that's important on page

607, Justice Scalia, is a requirement that Glendale shall

submit a stipulation, a stipulation that goodwill

resulting from this merger shall be determined, which

means shall be determined now and for the future in

accordance with a regulation, memorandum R31b, in effect

at the time.

QUESTION:

Well, the letter from -- a letter

from Glendale's accountant doesn't really sound like what

would be a binding, explicit promise on the Government.

MR. HOLLINGSWORTH:

Well, the Government

requires that Glendale's accountant, Glendale's agent

No, Your Honor, it is the

MR. COOPER:

That's the Statesman contract.
What about Winstar?
With respect to this particular

provision, Winstar had a virtually identical provision.

But the wording that I want to call the Court's

Yes, but there's several pieces of

MR. COOPER:

Yes, Your Honor, and I think that

2

the courts below well and correctly understood what

unmistakable means.

4

The unmistakable doctrine, unmistakability

5

doctrine, Your Honor, truly, if reduced to a sound bite,

is simply that the Government cannot be held to promises

that it doesn't make.

MR. COOPER:

2

Well, Your Honor, I think that it

3

is a canon of construction designed to aid this Court and

4

other courts in divining the true and genuine intent of

5

the contracting parties.
QUESTION:

6

Well, then it should be applied to

7

everybody.

8

determining the true intent of the parties?

9

Why limit it just to Government, if it aids in

MR. COOPER:

Well, Your Honor, I think the one

10

feature that it does bring is that when you are talking

11

about a contract such as what was alleged in Merrion and

12

what was alleged in the POSSE case, which they rely

13

prominently on, that is, a contract that would, indeed,

14

surrender a sovereign authority, there the taxing

15

authority in Merrion, the Court approaches that with some

16

skepticism, and so it requires that a clear expression of

17

that promise take place.

18

Your Honor, I am happy to live with the

19

unmistakability doctrine in no matter how rigid a

20

formulation except theirs.

21

Your Honor, for the purpose of saying a clear and plain

22

promise, even coupled with provisions like I have read to

23

you, is inadequate, because it isn't also coupled with the

24

further promise that we will not breach those promises.

QUESTION:

MR. COOPER:

Yes.
Thanks.
I see that my time has almost

expired, so let me close by simply saying this.

The

question before the Court is whether these contracting

parties are simply going to remain in the places that they

are, with the Government holding $24 million of my

10

client's money in its pocket, and with my clients with a

11

contractual oath.

If there are no additional questions --

QUESTION:

Precisely what did the Government

promise?

continue to do -- what it boils down to is, they promised

That's right.
Mr. Cooper, if you seek damages for

frustration, restitution, you still have to show a

That is to say, the measure of

10

damages doesn't particularly help us here, does it?

11

either case there has to be a contract that was A,

12

breached, or B, frustrated?

13

MR. COOPER:

Yes, Your Honor.

In

You at least have

14

to show that the parties attempted but failed to enter

15

into a binding contract.

QUESTION:

So is the contractual inquiry and the

In fact, in the

that the Government can't -- even if this contract was
