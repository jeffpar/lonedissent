ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH P. MAZUREK
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
GENERAL MAZUREK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Few matters are so troubling to modern society

14

as the vexing correlation between intoxication and

15

criminal behavior.

16

a violent act could not rely on his voluntarily

17

intoxicated condition to exculpate his conduct.

18

the Montana legislature, exercising the power

19

traditionally left to the States to prevent and deal with

20

crime, returned to that common law tradition.

21

At common law, a person who committed

In 1987,

It changed its substantive criminal law by

22

enacting a statute which precludes a defendant in a

23

criminal case from relying upon evidence of his own

24

voluntary intoxication from escaping personal

25

responsibility for his actions which ensued.

QUESTION:

Did the supreme court of Montana

agree with you that the substantive law had been changed?
GENERAL MAZUREK:

Mr. Chief Justice, the supreme

4

court of Montana did not address that issue.

The

5

supreme -- that issue was raised by the State in its

6

supplemental brief to the supreme court.

7

court's analysis skipped over the fact that the

8

legislature had passed the statute, or changed the statute

9

from its former provision, did not analyze the --or

The supreme

interpret the statute, rather, proceeded directly to the

11

due process analysis.

12

QUESTION:

Well, I thought the supreme court of

13

Montana found that under the statute the defendant had to

14

be proven to have acted knowingly and purposely.

15

GENERAL MAZUREK:

Justice O'Connor, that's true,

16

the statute requires the defendant - - requires the State

17

to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant

18

acted purposely and knowingly - -

Well, do you agree that under the

statute the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that the defendant acted knowingly and purposely?
GENERAL MAZUREK:

Yes, Your Honor, we do agree,

and we agree - QUESTION:

And if there were evidence that the

14

defendant at the time of the alleged crime had passed out

15

from voluntary intoxication, under the statute that

16

evidence could not be brought in by the defense.

QUESTION:

Sure.

2

GENERAL MAZUREK:

No, it would not.

It would go

3

more likely to -- it would -- the fact that the defendant

4

was unconscious would tend to show that he would -- may

5

have been physically unable to commit the act.

6

that's what this defendant raised the issue of voluntary

7

intoxication for, to say -QUESTION:

8

In fact,

Well, what about insanity in Montana?

9

Can a defendant bring in evidence to show that his mental

10

condition was such that he couldn't have acted purposely?
GENERAL MAZUREK:

11

Yes, Your Honor.

Under

12

Montana law a defendant can -- we do not call it insanity.

13

We call it mental disease or defect.

14

negate the purposely or knowingly element by proof of

15

mental disease or defect, but that is a much different

16

situation than what we have here.

GENERAL MAZUREK:

19

There was strong --

How about involuntary intoxication?
-- support for that

tradition -QUESTION:

A defendant may

How about involuntary intoxication,

GENERAL MAZUREK:

22

No, Your -- Justice Stevens,

23

we believe that's clearly excluded under the statute,

24

because it would not involve knowing consumption of the

25

alcohol.

In other words, he could rely on such

evidence?
GENERAL MAZUREK:

He could rely on such evidence

4

to show that he did not knowingly introduce the alcohol,

5

and that would excuse his conduct, yes.

But if I may --

QUESTION:

So intoxication can be relevant to

Your Honor --

Montana itself says that, because

involuntary intoxication is deemed sufficiently important

1

do you think, in any criminal case that a defendant has a

2

right to produce evidence that is relevant in his defense?
GENERAL MAZUREK:

3

We would --we don't believe

4

that there is as broad a right to introduce all relevant

5

evidence as the Montana supreme court suggests.
I think this Court has looked at - - the cases on

6

7

which the State court relied and on which respondent

8

relies, such as Chambers and Crane, in those instances,

9

the evidence being offered by the defendant was, in fact,

10

exculpatory under State law.
The circumstances surrounding a confession, or

11
12

procedural rules, were deemed arbitrary in the Chambers

13

case to - - and prevented the defendant from bringing in

14

evidence that another individual had confessed to those

15

crimes.

16

In those instances, the evidence which was

sought to be introduced was legally relevant under State

18

law by the State's -- legislature's determination it is

19

not legally relevant in Montana, and that is consistent

20

with the common law traditions, and based on valid public

21

policy reasons the correlation between -QUESTION:

22

Well, I mean, you couldn't say,

1

GENERAL MAZUREK:

2

QUESTION:

We could not.

All right.

So here what you've said

3

is, it's legally necessary to prove the person did have

4

purpose or intent, and here is some evidence that will

5

prove to the contrary but it's legally irrelevant, i.e.,

6

you won't let him present the evidence that is highly

7

likely to prove to the contrary, so what's the

8

justification for that?

9

GENERAL MAZUREK:

The justification, Your Honor,

10

for that position is first and foremost the tradition of

11

the common law, which denied any exculpatory value and, in

12

fact, there is some evidence that intoxication was

13

considered an aggravating factor.

14

And the example I guess I would give in this

15

case is the facts that -- on which purpose and knowledge

16

could have been inferred by the jury; the fact that Mr.

17

Egelhoff, with his own pistol, which had previously been

18

in the glove compartment, placed two well-placed shots

19

from a pistol into the heads of the two victims, he

20

attempted to evade detection after -- twice.

21

Once, a physician who was attempting to provide

22

assistance, he spoke with the -- the physician was so

23

scared he left the scene.

24

camera from a - - very deliberately kicked a camera out of

25

the defendant's -- or, excuse me, a detective's hands.

At the hospital he kicked a

1

All of that would -- or, those are logical to

2

show that this defendant acted with purpose or knowledge,

3

again directing the Court to the State's definition of

4

those -- of purposely and knowingly.

5

He must be aware of his conduct or aware that

6

there exists a high probability.

7

would tend to indicate that this was a deliberate shooting

8

of these two people, a person who, even though he may have

9

been intoxicated, and we don't know --

QUESTION:

All of the facts in this

But the supreme court of Montana

11

based its decision not on lack of evidence, as I

12

understand it, but on the instruction it was given.

13

GENERAL MAZUREK:

Mr. Chief Justice, there is a

14

comment in the decision that the instruction may -- might

15

have --a jury may have been misled into believing that

16

the State's burden had been reduced.

17

defendant acted purposefully and knowingly.

offered in support of that conclusion by the State

legislature.

QUESTION:

Is it --

2

QUESTION:

General Mazurek, the argument, or

3

suggestion at least is made by the people on the other

4

side that you could accomplish what you want to accomplish

5

without skirting, if not confronting some of these

6

constitutional problems if the State had simply passed a

7

statute saying, anybody who is intoxicated and who kills

8

another human being is guilty of first degree murder.

9

Or they could have said, anyone who does it

10

except while driving a car, to preserve the negligent

11

homicide case, but it could have made intoxication plus

12

causing death a crime.

13

The suggestion is, no problem.

Why shouldn't the State do that and, if you

14

know, why didn't the State do that?

15

GENERAL MAZUREK:

The State -- the State made

And so that creates a difficulty for you,

3

because it certainly is, in fact, relevant to those two

states of mind whether someone is intoxicated or not,

whereas if you were to have a statute that says, look,

That's a quite different disposition from anything else

them, then hold them to the reasonable doubt standard.
Here, the State court never really got to the

question of whether there has been a change in the State

law, because it simply jumped to the conclusion that, to

6

the extent that there had been one, it was barred by

7

Winship.

8

In our view that was, in a sense, putting the

9

cart before the horse, because it was using a test from

10

these case -- from this Court's cases that is directed at

11

the last step of the analysis as the first step, and what

12

it should have done to start with the analysis rightly was

to recognize that the proper test was whether this change

in the substantive conception of criminal liability was

consistent with the history and tradition of our people,

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes, they do, but what they do is

21

that they have a conception of knowledge and purpose from

22

which the effects of voluntary intoxication have been

23

extracted, which is not all that different from how the

24

common law dealt with the concept of malice aforethought.

1

law being completely intoxicated was as relevant in a

2

logical sense to whether one could form malice

3

aforethought.
QUESTION:

4

Can you tell me, Mr. Estrada, has --

5

what -- has the State here said in effect that this

6

knowledge and purpose is usually present in the

7

intoxicated person, and the jury can usually find it

8

despite the fact of the intoxication, or has it said that

9

we don't care about conscious purpose if the person is

10

intoxicated?

It's not clear to me the logical and the

11

common sense basis for the common law rule that you're

12

proposing.
MR. ESTRADA:

13

Well, let me indicate two possible

14

points.

15

really goes not so much to intent but to capacity to form

16

intent and, in that sense, it is a sort of evidence that

17

is not about the defendant himself but about hypothetical

18

third party.

19

The first point is that evidence of intoxication

It says, in effect, given certain medical data

20

most people would do X.

21

about the specific person, other than by inference that he

22

may be in the norm.

23

It doesn't really say anything

The second point is that a legislature could

24

reasonably conclude that the effects of voluntary

25

intoxication are not relevant to the law's conception of

1

intent,

in the sense that in the ordinary case the effect

2

is to remove inhibitions.
It doesn't keep people from being able to think

3
4

and choose, and to say that you're going to explain,

in a

5

way, how intoxication made it difficult to invoke

6

behavioral controls or to grasp how grave the conduct was

7

is one way of saying why the intent was there but not

8

really saying that it wasn't.

9

QUESTION:

In a way --

Is that a fair answer to Justice --

10

isn't the question whether you can determine whether the

11

intent was there or not, not why, or - - and is it not true

12

that if a person -- if the defendant got on the stand and

13

said I thought I was shooting at a pink elephant, or,

14

take Justice Scalia's example,

15

was totally intoxicated at the time, no one would ever

16

believe him.
MR. ESTRADA:

17

to

if he's not able to say he

Well, he can use the intoxication

18

to explain his current inability to have a complete

19

memory.

20

that because most people who have had a similar number of

21

drinks would have been intoxicated and impaired,

22

own intent was lacking.

23

What he is not allowed to do is to tell the jury

Now,

that his

let me hasten to say that that doesn't mean

24

that the State gets to prove that he is guilty of the

25

crime merely because he was drunk.

There may be cases, as

At the same time, in a case like this the State

can point to evidence in the record to show that this one

He has no

and in that sort of a case the State would have a very-

tough time showing that he was capable of knowledge and

purpose.

You have the same person who you happen to know

has ingested the same amount of alcohol in another

videotape, and he is taking aim at you, and he is shooting

and cocking his eye and saying something like, I got you

now, and he hits you in the middle of the forehead.

that I think are fairly significant.

2

The first one is that earlier in the day he had

QUESTION:

I've one question which I say, in

many cases this will work out fine, but some it might not.

13

I take it if you wilfully, intentionally get blind drunk,

14

and you run into a pedestrian in a sidewalk going 5 miles

15

an hour and kill him at 4:00 in the morning, you'll

16

probably be found guilty of first degree murder.

If you get similarly, absolutely blind drunk,

and you drive at 95 miles an hour, in the middle -- you

19

drive 95 miles an hour and run into somebody because

you're going too fast, you won't get convicted, right,

because there's no purpose, there's no knowledge.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. GERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Montana supreme court has authoritatively
construed the Montana law in this case.

This instruction

prevented the consideration by the jury, as it decided
whether or not there was reasonable doubt as to James
Egelhoff's acting purposely or knowingly, of evidence
that, as a matter of State law, negated those elements.
The jury's task is to ascertain the truth.

It

cannot do that if relevant evidence going to the proof of
an element of the charged offense is excluded from the
deliberations of the jury, the considerations by the jury
during its deliberations.

MS. GERMAN:

No, and the statute that existed

that the jury may consider intoxication.

It said

14

What happened in '87 is the jury was precluded

from considering it for any purpose, so when we get into

Egelhoff, certainly we could have presented and we did

present the evidence to prove that he was physically

incapable of acting, but the State introduced it to prove

that he was a violent drunk who killed with no motive.

that they can't do that.

but does not convict them of first degree murder if, blind

want to be clear about what I think they're saying the

to.

What's wrong with their justification?
MS. GERMAN:

Well, I'm not -- again, I can't get

12

away from this.

The Montana supreme court has interpreted

13

the statute that is -- that Mr. Egelhoff was charged with

14

here as requiring proof of the specific mental states, and

15

you can't do that if you don't allow the evidence of

16

intoxication to come in for the jury to consider it.

17

The jury does not have all of the relevant

18

evidence that they need, and in the Montana supreme

19

court's interpretation of its own statutes, this Court, as

20

I understand it, is bound by that interpretation.

21

QUESTION:

Ms. German, do I understand that the

22

argument you're making is, the State could make this

23

conduct as the same degree of culpability as now, so this

24

case is about form, that it didn't do it in the right

form, but they could accomplish exactly the same result

2

drunk the jury has got to be told that because it always

3

goes to culpability?
Are we dealing with pure form, or is there some

substance at stake?
MS. GERMAN:

6

Well, it's not pure form, and I

7

guess in response to your first -- the first proposition,

8

there is nothing in the Montana supreme court's opinion

9

here that prohibit's the jury, or the legislature from

10

doing what you suggest.

11

Now, they could write a statute that results in

12

a serious penalty being imposed on a person who commits a

13

crime when drunk without proof of any other mental state.

14

QUESTION:

15

MS. GERMAN:

Then why isn't it pure form?
Because in -- as has been recited

16

by this Court in fairly recent decisions, even when a case

17

exists where a person is absolutely guilty -- I mean, the

18

proof beyond them is overwhelming, we do not allow the

something different, and that difference is, two people,

That is not irrational in the sense of going to
