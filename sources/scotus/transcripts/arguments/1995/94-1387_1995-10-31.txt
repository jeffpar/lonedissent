MR. BARTLETT:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. BARTLETT, III
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11
12

13

Thank you.

MR. BARTLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This is a maritime collision case.

That means,

14

as the Third Circuit acknowledged, that substantive

15

admiralty and maritime law applies.

16

Where the Third Circuit went astray, however,

17

was in holding that maritime law does not supply the rule

18

of decision.

19

It does.

That rule is the general maritime law death

20

remedy announced by this Court in Moragne, and because

21

this is a maritime case, the choice of law analysis is

22

that of American Dredging.

23

First, Moragne.

24

QUESTION:

25

Do we actually know what difference

it makes as to what this particular plaintiff recovers

1

which view prevails?
MR. BARTLETT:

2

Well, of course, the damages

3

issues, the exact elements of damages issue was not

4

accepted by this Court, although it was one of those that

5

was --we asked the Court to address.
QUESTION:

6

So at this stage, we're deciding a

7

fairly abstract question, and conceivably it might not

8

make any difference, is that correct, that Puerto Rico

9

might have the same rule as the general maritime law?
MR. BARTLETT:

10

I believe you are addressing, in

11

that sense, an abstract question, yes, and, indeed, the

12

damages issues can go either way, depending upon what

13

State law you're applying, not just Puerto Rico or

14

Pennsylvania, but my own State of Maryland, would have

15

differences between those.
QUESTION:

16
17

Do the definitions of the primary

duty possibly differ, depending on the rule we adopt?
MR. BARTLETT:

18

I do not believe so.

The primary

19

duty would be, of course, set out in the various liability

20

theories.

21

or accepts and recognizes all of the various theories for

22

product liability -- strict product liability, negligence,

23

and warranty -- but that would not be the case, say, for

24

example, were the plaintiff or the victim to have died in

25

the territorial waters of Delaware.

In this particular case, maritime law addresses

Delaware does not

1

recognize strict liability in tort product defects, so

2

negligence would be there.

3

QUESTION:

So when we're deciding this case, I

4

assume we should consider that the consequences of our

5

decision may have some bearing on how the primary duty

6

will be defined in other cases that come before us.

7

MR. BARTLETT:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Certainly --

Or are you just confining your

argument to questions of damages and remedy?
MR. BARTLETT:

No.

I think -- Yamaha is a boat

11

manufacturer, but it stands in the shoes of any potential

12

maritime defendant who could be sued for the death of a

13

"civilian."

14

shipbuilder.

15

It could be a shipowner.

QUESTION:

It could be

Yes, but isn't there this difference:

16

you really wouldn't have a seaworthiness claim with this

17

particular article, would you?

18

MR. BARTLETT:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. BARTLETT:

21

22

No.

Seaworthiness is a -

Which is what we had in Moragne.
-- has a theory of liability that

is only available to a Jones Act seaman.
QUESTION:

Well, theoretically you could have a

23

seaworthiness theory of absolute liability for passengers,

24

couldn't you?

25

MR. BARTLETT:

Well, the strict liability theory

1

is certainly an absolute liability theory, so if it was a

2

claim that the ship or a passenger on a ship was injured

3

by some defect or defective design of the ship or the

4

boat, then you would have an absolute liability theory

5

under which the plaintiff could recover, but it would not

6

be the unseaworthiness theory.

7
8

9

QUESTION:

In this case we have a negligence

theory, don't we?
MR. BARTLETT:

We have a -- we have negligence

10

but there's also a claim in strict liability, which this

11

Court recognized as being viable under maritime law in the

12

East River case.

13

QUESTION:

You contend that marine preempts the

14

negligence theory, don't you?

15

MR. BARTLETT:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. BARTLETT:

No, I don't.

Oh.
First of all, I think Moragne

18

precludes the remedy of State wrongful death, but it

19

doesn't preempt any theory along those lines, so --

20
21

QUESTION:

Because, as Federal common law, we

can adopt that theory.

22

MR. BARTLETT:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

What theory is that, Your Honor?

Any theory that is not -- you say it

doesn't preempt a particular theory of liability.
MR. BARTLETT:

Correct.

QUESTION:

1

And the answer to that is because we

2

can make up common law, Federal common law, and adopt a

3

different theory.

4

MR. BARTLETT:

And you have.

Certainly in the

5

East River case you adopted a common law rule that was

6

based upon looking at what the States did, what the

7

Restatement says, and you adopted in essence the 402(a)

8

section absolute strict liability for product defect, and

you said -QUESTION:

reasoning.

Your reasoning is that because State law is

precluded.

In Moragne there were

There was the Florida negligence

21

MR. BARTLETT:

Yes.

And Moragne held that the

2

MR. BARTLETT:

3

QUESTION:

Correct.

Do you contend that if the same two-

4

count complaint were filed today, that the negligence,

5

State law negligence theory would be preempted?

6

MR. BARTLETT:

Yes, because I believe the

7

Moragne theory of recovery adapts itself, or allows itself

8

to go forward under any theory of liability, be it strict

9

product liability, be it negligence --

10
11

QUESTION:

Even though it was not preempted in

Moragne itself?

12

MR. BARTLETT:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

And even though Moragne, even going

14

back to The Harrisburg, said the way we got into this mess

15

in the first place was that they sued too late on the

16

State claim.

17

19

MR. BARTLETT:

Yes, well, The Harrisburg, of

course, held that there was no wrongful death remedy.

Yes, but let me just understand this

background of the case.

water deaths.

1

The Harrisburg said there was none under the general

2

maritime law.
QUESTION:

3

So when the Death on the High Seas

4

Act was passed, everyone understood that for inland

5

waters, as distinguished from overseas, that their State

6

law remedies would apply.

7

MR. BARTLETT:

That was because, I believe, that

8

the Congress, when it passed the Death on the High Seas

9

Act, was providing the remedy where there was none.

10

It

was solving the problem --

11

QUESTION:

Right.

12

MR. BARTLETT:

13

QUESTION:

-- that was presented to it.

Right, and then we get Moragne, which

14

involves an unseaworthiness claim, and this Court is

15

adding something that didn't exist before, a Federal

16

maritime law claim for the unseaworthiness for the benefit

17

of a longshore worker, and that's what Moragne itself

18

does.

19

It adds something.
Now, you are saying, but without saying so,

20

implicit in Moragne is also a subtraction, and how do you

21

get to the subtraction?

22

don't see in the decision itself anything that says and,

23

not only are we creating this seaworthiness that the

24

States don't know about because they don't know about

25

seaworthiness doctrine, but we are also taking away what

I see what Moragne added, but I

1

everyone understood was in place up until now.
MR. BARTLETT:

2

I think the logic of Moragne is

3

such that you can only read it as providing a uniform

4

death remedy that is to apply to the exclusion of State

5

wrongful death statutes.
QUESTION:

6

Well, Mr. Bartlett, to put it another

7

way, it seems to me for you to prevail we would have to

8

extend Moragne, because it didn't really cover this.
MR. BARTLETT:

9

It only went to the

10

unseaworthiness theory of liability, that's correct,

11

but - QUESTION:

12

3

I mean, it seems to me you'd have to

extend it.

4

Do you see any room in State territorial -- in

5

territorial waters for both admiralty law and State law,

6

depending on the circumstances?

7

MR. BARTLETT:

No, I don't.

I believe the

8

Moragne remedy provides both a wrongful death remedy and

9

several of the lower courts have also held that it can

20
21

provide a survival -QUESTION:

Well, there's a division of opinion

22

on whether Moragne should be extended to this, but it --

23

what is the Federal interest in uniformity in connection

24

with a jet ski accident in territorial waters?

uniformity?

Why isn't that much closer to traditional

2

State negligence actions, where State law should govern?

3

I mean, territorial waters encompass navigable

4

waters within a State, do they not, rivers, lakes, so

5

forth, and up to 3 miles out to sea.

6

talking about?

7

MR. BARTLETT:

Yes.

Is that what we're

Well, this Court in

8

Foremost and Sisson held that admiralty jurisdiction

9

extended to all navigable waters, and certainly where a

10

recreational boat collision, as was the case in this case,

11

was involved.

12

QUESTION:

Well, there can be admiralty

13

jurisdiction in territorial waters, we've so held, but

14

perhaps it's limited to where there's really a Federal

15

interest, where there are seamen involved, or longshoremen

16

and harbor workers, or something of that sort.

17
18
19

Is it necessary that it extend -- admiralty rule
of law extend to recreational boating accidents?
MR. BARTLETT:

I believe it is, because the

20

Constitution, Article III, section 2, spoke to the

21

exclusive jurisdiction of the courts, and with that this

22

Court has held time and time again that that power meant

23

that the Federal courts were to fashion this general

24

maritime law, exactly what this Court did in Moragne.

now to admiralty jurisdiction.

2

please, but I had thought that for many years admiralty

jurisdiction has been a forum for enforcing any number of

State rules and State primary duties.

MR. BARTLETT:

QUESTION:

Tell me if I'm wrong,

Sir --

I mean, it seems to me that we're

mixing up jurisdiction here with the source of the primary

allowed to overcome that presumption, if you will, that

There are certain situations that this Court has

QUESTION:

Mr. Bartlett, I think you conceded,

18

and you were very forthright in this, that pre-Moragne,

19

the law that was applied in cases like this was State law,

20

State wrongful death acts, State survival acts, and you

21

are not suggesting now, are you, that that was an

22

unconstitutional course?

23

MR. BARTLETT:

Not at all.

I believe that was

24

this Court trying to, without specifically overruling The

25

Harrisburg, nevertheless allowing a remedy.

The Harrisburg was a wrong decision.

This Court

2

later in Moragne said it was.

3

without overruling Harrisburg, this Court allowed the

4

State wrongful death statutes to ameliorate, as it were,

5

the harsh effects of the Harrisburg rule.

6

QUESTION:

But in the meantime,

On your theory, is there any role

left for the enforcement of a State rule on a kind of

QUESTION:

What about the death of a swimmer?

MR. BARTLETT:

It would depend on how the

swimmer died, Your Honor.

5

For example, I would contend that if a boat in

6

navigation was the force that caused the swimmer to die,

7

then admiralty jurisdiction would be present, and

8

substantive admiralty law would apply.

If the swimmer, on the other hand, was just
swimming from shore with no relationship --

Two swimmers collide.

MR. BARTLETT:

Excuse me?

Two swimmers collide, no -- State law

can apply in that case.

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. BARTLETT:

the State certainly has

an interest, but so does the Federal Government.

you'll find in this area that there are specific statutes

and regulations.

legislation and regulations that cede certain

responsibilities to the State.

is disturbed by allowing State law to control this kind of

myself depend upon.

or whether

1

you say, this is a maritime tort, exclusive jurisdiction

2

of which is given to an admiralty court, saving to

3

suitors, but that's a remedial and not a positive

4

question.

5

But so -- for we have an admiralty tort under

6

Federal law, but by the way, we'll borrow State law,

7

which, of course, is what we should do, unless it's

8

hostile to statutes.

All right, so I don't understand why it makes a

difference, but I did think of an example where it would

If the answer to that question is yes, and I

suppose that what's been happening in personal injury

cases is they've been borrowing the entire State action,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL A. ENGELMAYER

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

9

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. ENGELMAYER:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Our position is twofold.

12

First, the general

13

Federal maritime death remedy applies to the death of any

14

nonseaman in territorial waters within admiralty

15

jurisdiction and, second, that remedy may not be

16

supplemented by State remedies.

17

Let me begin very briefly with the first point.

If Moragne didn't decide it, what

did?
MR. ENGELMAYER:
QUESTION:

What decides the --

Decide your view.

MR. ENGELMAYER:

Right.

What decides the

displacement of State remedies issue is the settled
principle noted by this Court in Tallentire that State law
may not apply where it would change substantive admiralty
law.
That has applied in the context of remedies both
where the remedies were developed by statute, as in the
cases of Tallentire and Chelentis -- excuse me, Tallentire
and Gillespie, dealing with the statutory death remedies
under the DOHSA and the Jones Act.

It's applied in the

context of injury in the Chelentis case -- where this
Court developed a substantive maritime law that said at
the time that only maintenance and cure were recoverable
by seamen, and therefore State remedies were precluded
where they sought full indemnification, and that same
principle -QUESTION:

You say Tallentire decided --

MR. ENGELMAYER:

Yes.

I think Tallentire is,

well, factually not on point, as a matter of legal
principle on point, for this reason.

1

Tallentire, after establishing that there was no

2

affirmative preservation of State death remedies on the

3

high seas then had to confront the issue of whether, under

4

settled principles of admiralty law, whether there was any

5

room for a conflicting State damages remedy.

6

The Court held that there was not, and the Court

7

stated the operative principle -- I believe it's on pages

8

223, 222, 224 -- that the State law cannot change

9

substantive admiralty law.

In this case --

10

QUESTION:

Well, what's the substantive

11

admiralty law here?

12

here, assuming admiralty jurisdiction to begin with,

Aren't we addressing the question

should there in fact be a substantive admiralty rule to be

4

applied, and therefore to displace State law?

addressing a different question?

Aren't we

threshold issue I meant to address, which is just what is

the scope of the general --

is addressed, Tallentire isn't on point, or we can't tell

21

whether it's on point.

MR. ENGELMAYER:

I agree.

Let me explain why I

believe that issue is settled.

the specific problems accommodating unseaworthiness to

2

have been no reason to overrule The Harrisburg, which was

3

a negligence case, and the Court throughout Moragne made

4

clear that it was reluctant to -- that it felt that the

5

bar to recovery in death cases had been anachronistic,

6

whereas the Court put the point, barbarous, and so it

7

wrote that an action does lie under general maritime law

8

for death caused by violation of maritime duties.

9

duties include no negligence, the duty of due care.

10
11

There would

Those

That's in the Kermarec case from 1959.
And so our point here is that there is no reason

12

the maritime death remedy should not apply to when the

13

person killed by maritime tort just happens to be a so-

14

called recreational boater.

15

QUESTION:

In this case, I get the sense we

16

don't know what the State remedies are, and we don't know

17

what the admiralty remedies are.

18

MR. ENGELMAYER:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Right.

So we're talking about a very

abstract proposition that may make no difference at all.
MR. ENGELMAYER:

Conceivably, although I think

22

at the end of the day the issue would be, are State

23

remedies precluded because they are inconsistent with the

24

Federal maritime remedy, so while it's possible at the end

25

of the day a State remedy could apply, that is only

6

QUESTION:

It seems to me that we have two

7

choices to make.

8

MR. ENGELMAYER:

9

QUESTION:

Right.

If we agree with you, we displace a

substantial body of State law on products liability

11

personal negligence, et cetera, in all death cases, areas

12

in which States have very substantial expertise, very

3
4

well-developed bodies of law.
If we agree with the respondent, we displace the

5

rules of most of the circuit courts that have ruled in

6

this area, but it seems to me that it's asking the Federal

7

courts to begin developing, to continue to develop

8

wrongful death rules in territorial waters where we don't

9

really have that much of an interest.

20

MR. ENGELMAYER:

Let me address those first as a

matter of precedent, second as a matter of policy.
With regard to precedent, the Federal courts in

The interest is that Article

18

MR. ENGELMAYER:

Right, and I think historically

19

the reason between The Harrisburg and Moragne, why State

remedies were picked up, was akin -- was simply because

21

there was a gap in Federal remedial coverage, and the

That remedy is measured by

I think you also make the more

general point, if I understood your answer to my earlier

question, and that is, Tallentire applies because Moragne

requires you -- requires the Federal admiralty courts to

develop substantive law in this area.

MR. ENGELMAYER:

QUESTION:

Exactly.

There is no choice left.

We may not

know what it is yet, but there is no choice but to develop

it.
MR. ENGELMAYER:

I couldn't put it better, and

essentially the lower Federal courts for 25 years have

fleshed out the Moragne remedy in the nonseamen

2

apply for nonseamen, nonlongshoremen, State law?

3

I mean, there may be a curlicue that they lop

4

off, but that's why I don't understand what this is about,

5

because the normal thing would say, just as we did in that

6

range, or whatever it is, borrow State law, unless the

7

State law is -- what happens in personal injury cases?

8

The only time I have to look it up in that case, it looked

9

as if what I was supposed to do was, here it is, an

10

admiralty cause of action, it doesn't concern a seaman,

11

doesn't concern a longshoreman, so I should borrow State

12

law, and I would borrow State law unless it was

13

inconsistent with some admiralty principle.

14

Now, isn't that what you should do even aside

MR. ENGELMAYER:

that punitives shouldn't be picked up, and nobody's really

MR. ENGELMAYER:

I think the Wahlstrom case, to

11

the extent that any court of appeals deals with this

12

systematically, does -- that's out of the Second

13

Circuit -- does address the issue.

14

I suppose the point, though, is that if the

Federal damages remedy in this quadrant of territorial

It might

No, Your Honor, it doesn't for

to death on the high seas, there's the Death on the High

18

Seas Act, and for longshoremen or harbor workers there is

another Federal statute, and so when -- cases like Miles

there was a comprehensive Federal statute, and this Court

said in every one of those cases, we are not in a position

in, in Moragne itself, they referred that question to the

The Pope and Talbot case and some others have

suggested that State law cannot apply where it would be

principle of maritime law that would be applicable to this

As Justice Kennedy said, there's no Federal

interest in the regulation of this kind of jet ski

of the opinions of this Court, cited by the petitioners

Well --

Let me ask you -But I don't think -- Congress has

not addressed the issue except in one respect, Your Honor,

10

and I will point this out.

In 1980, Congress passed a

11

statute which is applicable to this case, or to a limited

12

part of this case.

13

It said that the statute of limitations for all

14

maritime torts is 3 years -- death, personal injury, high

15

seas, territorial water -- and I think that's evidence

16

that when Congress has seen a need for uniformity, a need

17

for clarity, it has come in and superseded both Federal

18

statutes and State statutes.

19

QUESTION:

Yes, well, we've never felt that we

20

had judicial authority to create statutes of limitations.

21

We've always looked to State law for those, even in areas

22

where it's a Federal cause of action, so that would

23

explain that statute rather readily.

Well, Your Honors applied laches

2

Well, I mean the Congress would not

have expected us to adopt a statute of limitations.
But I want to get to another question.

You said

that at least State law is well-known, whereas we'd be

5

making up new Federal admiralty law.
Well, I suppose it's well-known if you know what

State laws apply.

note that here you're seeking to apply Pennsylvania law to

9

an injury that occurred in Puerto Rico.

Now, is that a matter of Federal -- I

have guessed that?

There is, of course, another aspect which the

9

plaintiffs, the petitioners don't want to talk about, and

10

that is, the theory of displacement of Moragne is that we

11

are -- we take the Moragne cause of action and apply it.

12

If you do that literally, what you have done is, you must

13

have applied the doctrine of unseaworthiness, because

14

there is no case that I know of which displaces something

15

with nothing, and that is, presumably if this case is

16

governed by Federal law of Moragne it is the law of

unseaworthiness.

And then the question is, how does one determine

19

the seaworthiness or unseaworthiness of a jet ski, and I

20

suggest to you that simply is a further reason that if

21

you're talking about uniformity, you've got to take the

22

good with the bad, which in this case would be

23

unseaworthiness, and it ought not to be an inquiry of the

24

Federal courts when we have had for more than 100 years

25

perfectly adequate State law remedies.

The only reason that they are here is not

because they're complaining that States are imposing

primary conduct obligations that are inconsistent, but

because they want to pay less, and they think they can do

it by doing it that way.

never, to my knowledge, decided that question.

to that question must be the same.

that -- to have a regime under which the question of
