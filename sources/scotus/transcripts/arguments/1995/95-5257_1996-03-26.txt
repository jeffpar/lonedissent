ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT G. LeBELL

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11
12

MR. LeBELL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the Court:
We believe this Court should maintain the de

13

novo review standard for Fourth Amendment warrantless

14

cases as it has previously done in First Amendment cases,

15

Fourth Amendment cases, Fifth Amendment cases, and Sixth

16

Amendment cases.

17

We believe that the recently enunciated decision

18

in Keohane is instructive in how the principle is evolved

19

in determining that de novo review is appropriate in

20

warrantless Fourth Amendment cases.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. LeBell, it seems to me in --

22

either the magistrate or the district judge made a finding

23

of fact as to credibility.

24

particular finding be reviewed de novo, would you?

25

MR. LeBELL:

You wouldn't suggest that that

No, Justice Rehnquist.

I believe

1

that that is historical fact, and that an historical fact

2

determined below is to be given deference.

3

issue with is the determination, legal determination

4

whether the law was correctly applied, and that mixed

5

question of law and fact we believe should be accorded de

6

novo review.

7

QUESTION:

What we take

We believe that there are three sound

8

reasons why de novo review should be accorded warrantless

9

Fourth Amendment cases.

First of all, historically this

10

Court has given de novo review for constitutionally

11

enshrouded issues.

12

Secondly, de novo review furthers the appellate

13

directive of developing the law, making consistency in the

14

law, and basically in error-correcting, and thirdly, we

15

believe that the decision, or, strike that, the de novo

16

review standard is consistent with the principles

17

enunciated in Gates v. Illinois.

18

This Court has in the past addressed issues that

19

are encapsulated in the Fifth Amendment, and basically it

20

has determined that de novo review is appropriate.

21

In the Keohane decision, this Court basically

22

said, although the issue of voluntary -- strike that, of

23

custody is fact-laden, in other words, the issue is a

24

question of what facts occurred during the course of the

25

custody, still we believe that the question of whether, in

1

fact, the person was in custody for the purposes of

2

Miranda requires de novo review.

3
4
5

QUESTION:

That was Federal habeas, though,

under a statute, wasn't it?
MR. LeBELL:

That is correct.

It was a question

6

of whether there was a presumption of correctness under

7

2254(d), but still the Court --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. LeBELL:

This is a direct appeal.
That is correct.

We do not believe

10

that the differentiation between a habeas action or a

11

direct appeal should in any way prevent this Court from

12

according de novo review or plenary review in Fourth

13

Amendment warrantless cases.

14

QUESTION:

Well, I can see why you argue

15

naturally for plenary review, but I don't see how you

16

could derive much support from a holding that was based on

17

the Federal habeas statute, which this isn't.

18

MR. LeBELL:

I believe I'm looking at the words

19

that were enunciated in that decision.

20

case was also backed up in this Court's decision in Ker,

21

this Court's decision in Beck, Carroll, and Brineger, all

22

of those --

23

QUESTION:

24

you to rely on, then.

25

MR. LeBELL:

Those cases, that

Maybe those would be better cases for

Certainly.

Those Fourth Amendment cases that have been

1

2

previously been decided basically, whether the Court

3

actually spoke the words de novo, it certainly conducted

4

an independent review.

5

In the Ker case, in fact, the Court said that

6

when it is to be -- it's considering a constitutionally

7

enshrouded issue, and specifically Fourth Amendment, it's

8

going to be an independent review, and the importance of

9

that is to assure that the Fourth Amendment as a

10

constitutional right is, in fact, upheld.
Similarly, the Court decided the same principle

11
12

13

in Beck.
In Carroll and Brineger, again, those two

14

decisions were based on a fundamental reevaluation of the

15

law and, based on that reevaluation of the law, some of

16

the cases were overturned, and some of them were affirmed.

17

In the Cortez case, which was a case decided by

18

this Court, the lower court determined that the decision

19

satisfied the definition of clearly erroneous.

20

got to this tribunal, this Court showed no deference to

21

the clearly erroneous determination and, in fact, reviewed

22

the determination de novo.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

When it

You -- what court made the

determination of clearly erroneous in Cortez?
MR. LeBELL:

The lower court.

QUESTION:

1

2

The district court, or the court of

appeals?

3

MR. LeBELL:

No, the court of appeals, and upon

4

reviewing the district court's decision determined that

5

there was no clear error, and therefore it affirmed the

6

decision, and this Court then reversed, showing, in

7

essence, no deference to the decision by the court of

8

appeals.

9

QUESTION:

Well, surely there are no aspects of

10

Fourth Amendment doctrine, be it the lawfulness of the

11

stop, the lawfulness of the search that follows the stop,

12

that couldn't and wouldn't have been developed had we used

13

the de novo -- pardon me, a clearly erroneous standard of

14

review in the circuit courts all this time.

15

MR. LeBELL:

It is our position -- you're

16

correct that certainly the law will develop.

17

that the law can most effectively develop through the de

18

novo review standard.

19

QUESTION:

We believe

Well, doesn't it develop in the same

20

way?

21

Amendment search and seizure would look any different

22

today had we been proceeding under a clearly erroneous

23

review standard?

24
25

Do you really think that the doctrine of the Fourth

MR. LeBELL:

I believe it would look

differently.

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. LeBELL:

Why is that, and in what respects?
I can point the Court to this

3

particular case, where the circuit, or the circuit court

4

of appeals specifically said, we find this to be a close

5

case, but because we are bound by the clearly erroneous

6

standard, we're going to have to affirm, and that was in

7

light of the fact that on two occasions the district court

8

reversed the finding of the magistrate judge, who had

9

listened to 4 days of testimony, reversed the finding of

10

11

probable cause.
QUESTION:

But that's going to be the case where

12

there are multifarious factors, and there, a court of

13

appeals may well reverse the district court, but to assume

14

that that's of any use to the system you have to posit a

15

following case that has the same multifarious factors,

16

which doesn't very often happen.

17

Where you have a single factor, like one case we

18

had 9 or -- 8 or 9 years ago involving whether it's an

19

unreasonable search when an officer who is in a room

20

lawfully sees a turntable in plain view and opens it up,

21

you know, turns it over to look at the bottom to get the

22

serial number, that issue -- couldn't that issue be

23

decided just as well and established just as well under a

24

clearly erroneous standard?

25

legal issue.

It's an isolated, discrete

MR. LeBELL:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. LeBELL:

I do not believe so
Why not?
-- and I don't believe so because

4

it's my understanding and my concept of Fourth Amendment

5

development that there's a waxing and a waning.

6

some entrenchments, there are some developments based on

7

technological changes, based on societal changes, and in

8

order to allow for these changes I think that each case,

9

in and of itself, has precedential value.

10

QUESTION:

There are

Well, tell me -- tell me how the

11

turntable case could not have been decided just as well

12

under a clearly erroneous standard.

13

MR. LeBELL:

If the court had, I assume in that

14

particular case looked at the facts and determined that

15

those didn't satisfy probable cause.

16

QUESTION:

Well, the lower court simply held

17

that if -- that the police officer is lawfully in the

18

room, this isn't a search and seizure because it's a

19

minimal disruption, and whether you apply clearly

20

erroneous or de novo, the fact is that it's clearly

21

erroneous to say that a minimal disruption is not a

22

disruption.

23

MR. LeBELL:

That is correct.

However, if the

24

court had been -- not had its hand tied, and had allowed a

25

de novo review, it could have perhaps addressed other

1

issues, and it could have considered it in light of

2

some --

3

QUESTION:

It really seems to me that the only

4

advantage for making law that de novo review contains is

5

an advantage when you assume that the very same

6

multiplicity of factors will be replicated in the future,

7

which doesn't very often happen, it seems to me.
MR. LeBELL:

8

Justice Scalia, I would disagree

9

with that proposition, because I believe that each of

10

these cases, while they are specific and of paramount

11

importance to the litigants, ultimately have a place in

12

the compendium of cases that result in changes in the

13

Fourth Amendment.

14

QUESTION:

Well, take this case.

Judge Posner's

15

opinion was very, very helpful and lucid.

16

operating under a different standard, the one that you

17

contend for, de novo review, would he have said anything

18

different?

19

emerged that would be more helpful to the system?

20

If he had been

Would any different legal positions have

MR. LeBELL:

My response would be, I don't know,

21

because he was bound by the clearly erroneous standard.

22

can speculate, and my speculation would be in his

23

discussion of the NADDIS, the use of NADDIS, whether

24

NADDIS was appropriate, whether there should be more

25

discussion of NADDIS, whether the defendants should have

been allowed access to the hard copy of the NADDIS, same

circumstances, perhaps this was an occasion the drug

MR. LeBELL:

9

QUESTION:

Well -- sorry.
Yes, Justice Breyer.
Were you finished?
I'm done.
The -- what I thought -- I agreed

10

with Justice Kennedy, I thought where the issue is one of

11

elaborating the law, elaborating it, there, certainly the

12

court of appeals, apparently, as Judge Posner did, feels

13

free to do that under the deferential standard, and that's

14

certainly appropriate.

15

statistics, and elaborating the law.

16

It's a very interesting opinion on

We're only talking, I take it, where it's pure

17

application of a label to a set of facts.

18

we're talking about?

19

MR. LeBELL:

20

QUESTION:

21

Is that what

We're talking about a situation -The application of a legal label to a

set of facts?

22

MR. LeBELL:

23

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Well, in that respect, should we not

24

pay more attention to district courts that deal with these

25

things regularly, that understand the sort of impossible11

1

to-set-down-in-writing factors, and try to prevent too

2

many absolute elaborations by appeals judges, who know

3

less about it?

4

MR. LeBELL:

I would like to reserve 2 minutes.

5

I don't believe that the district court in this

6

position -- in this particular case, nor in any other

7

case, is better suited to decide -QUESTION:

8

9
10

If you want to go ahead, you go

ahead, because there's other people who could answer that,
I realize, if you don't want to --

11

MR. LeBELL:

I can answer the question.

12

I don't believe that the district court in this

13

case, or in any other case, is better suited to make an

14

application of the fundamental legal principles to the

15

facts.

16

In fact, Salve Regina, decided by this Court, is

17

instructive in that respect, in that the courts of appeals

18

are better situated because of their fundamental acts,

19

because of their institutional values, that they can

20

pause, they can reflect and spend the time, once the facts

21

have been developed below, to address the legal concepts

22

and develop those legal concepts.

23

So I don't believe that deference of the legal

24

decision could be accorded the district courts, especially

25

in this particular case, where the district court

1

basically, without hearing a single witness, and on the

2

first occasion with only hearing one transcript which

3

emanated out of 4 days of testimony, reversed the

4

decision, which was a well-reasoned decision by the

5

magistrate.
I realize that under the Magistrate Act that the

6

7

court was entitled to do that, but I think it was

a

inappropriate.
QUESTION:

10

Absolutely.

I think that is de novo,

isn't it?

11

MR. LeBELL:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, it is.
But you take some offense at the

13

district court reversing de novo the magistrate, but you

14

want the court of appeals to reverse de novo the district

15

court.

16

MR. LeBELL:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. LeBELL:

Well -I find that -- you know.
-- I think that when you talk about

1

a de novo review that's allowed under the Magistrate Act,

20

I think it is assumed that there's going to be full

21

compliance, and clearly, the first time round, when Judge

22

Randa reviewed the appeal by the petitioners, there was

23

not a de novo review as it was contemplated by the

24

Magistrate Act.

25

I would reserve my last few minutes.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CORNELIA T. L. PILLARD

4

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

5
6

MS. PILLARD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

7

Our position is that determinations of

8

reasonable suspicion and probable cause to search without

9

a warrant are subject to de novo review in the courts of

10

appeals, and there are three closely related reasons why

11

de novo review is the correct standard here.

12

First is the role of the courts of appeals as an

13

expositor of the law.

14

justify a stop or a search is a very general standard, and

15

it's only through the process of case-by-case adjudication

16

that specific content over patterns of cases can be given

17

to the --

18

QUESTION:

The level of suspicion required to

Well, why do we need specific content

19

to be given?

20

suspicion, and just have an ad hoc decision in every case?

21

Why do we need more elaboration of the law?

22

Why isn't it sufficient to say reasonable

MS. PILLARD:

I think there are two reasons for

23

that, Justice Rehnquist.

24

uniform standards from court to court, and the second is

25

the need of law enforcement in applying those very general

First is the need to have

1

standards to have some guidance as to what those standards

2

mean, and this case is a good example of that.

3

Because the court of appeals applied the clear

4

error standard, we're left not really knowing what the

5

court of appeals itself thought was the correct result.

6

It thought that the district court's decision fell within

7

a range of permissible results, but we don't know whether

8

the court thought it was ideal, and that leaves law

9

enforcement officers, when they do confront this type of

10

situation again, not knowing whether, if the district

11

court in the other -- in the second case were to suppress,

12

would the court of appeals reverse that or not.

3

So we're left with a more murky standard than we

4

would have if the court of appeals had affirmed under the

5

de novo standard.

6

law enforcement officers --

7

QUESTION:

We'd have clearer guidance, and Federal

Oh, undoubted -- I mean, if you say,

8

you know, whether once in a blue moon you wouldn't get

9

clearer guidance, I'm sure you would, but that argues for

de novo review in every case.

improvement in legal certainties.

22

MS. PILLARD:

You'd get some marginal

We think that it's worth the

23

effort that in de novo review you do get clearer guidance

1

issues, is that the position you take?
MS. PILLARD:

2

We're here arguing that you do

3

this for reasonable suspicion and for probable cause, for

4

the reasons that this Court has used in analyzing the

5

standard of review question, that we think there is

6

important precedent to be generated, and that the guidance

7

that that gives to law enforcement is very helpful.

8

enforcement -QUESTION:

9

Law

Well, I suppose that just as the

10

courts of appeals have to bring some unity to the district

11

courts, we have, you know, a lot of courts of appeals.

12

suppose we should grant a significant number of petitions

13

for certiorari for the same reason in these cases to

14

decide whether probable -- you know, no particular issue,

15

but just whether this combination of factors is enough to

16

constitute probable cause.

17

General would urge us to accept cert in a fair number of

18

cases.

19

MS. PILLARD:

I

I suppose that the Solicitor

We're not arguing for a change in

20

the certiorari standard.

It may be that there are

21

situations where you see a repeat pattern, airport stops,

22

bus stops, or traffic stops without a traffic violation,

23

where the Court will think, this is something that's come

24

up so many times --

25

That's a simple, isolable issue which

1

would come up under clearly erroneous review --

2

MS. PILLARD:

3

QUESTION:

Well --

-- like the turntable example.

If

4

there is a single factor that is improperly used, clearly

5

erroneous will get that, won't it?

6

MS. PILLARD:

It's true that some general rules,

7

under the outlines of the Fourth Amendment standard will

8

emerge under the clear error standard, but the plain

9

review doctrine is a much more distinctly legal doctrine.

10

Here, people are really focusing on the application of

11

this very general probable cause standard, and how do we

12

give that content.

13

It's important to note that the experience of

14

the Federal Government in training our officers, the FBA

officers -- FBI officers and the DEA agents is that in

16

training them on what the content is of probably cause and

17

reasonable suspicion, they have to teach by illustration.

They take the kinds of circumstances that these officers

19

run into, and they give them decided court cases to show

MS. PILLARD:

are very much guided by one another.

QUESTION:

I think you're right that if the

2

Seventh were talking solely about the application of a

3

label to a set of facts, if circuit courts do it you will

4

get better precedent.

5

I agree with you.

That also has a down side.

There will be less

6

flexibility in the law, and the other down side, which I

7

don't know how much weight to give it, is that district

8

judges would then feel that they have to really write out

9

every last detailed fact, including matters of mood and

10

that -- very hard to write down.

11

What they do now very often is, they just say,

12

probable cause, that's it, and they don't feel they have

3
4
5

to go and write every last little bit down.
So how do we weigh that?

On the one side,

you're right about it being more binding precedent.

On

16

the other side, it's going to be quite a complicated thing

7

in many cases to try to write everything down -- you know,

8

every last little detail-- because the three judges up

9

there who know nothing about it are going to start second-

20
21

guessing it.
So that's an administrative -- I mean, I'm sort

that that's something that is going to be less likely to

be lost here in the translation, and you know, the

countervailing concerns are that these are followed as

you might mention them.

them.

I've had some opportunity to cover

They are the guidance that's needed by law

10

enforcement, and the uniformity of the law, that the

11

Fourth Amendment should not mean different things in

12

different courtrooms simply because one judge takes a

13

position that a certain quantum of information amounts to

14

reasonable suspicion and another judge dealing with

identical facts --

The last reason surely proves too

much.

Well, determined really that you

don't have the kind of VP fact patterns that create any

kind of meaningful disuniformity from courtroom to

10

So it was more that when you look at the whole

12

than when you deal with the kinds of patterns of crime

13

that law enforcement are investigating where they see the

5

MS. PILLARD:

Well, in Carroll and in Beck the

6

standard, and I think in practice you see in analyzing the

cases that the Court has exercised its own judgment and

not referred to the need to defer to any district court,

11

Is it different from the standard

12

that's used when the Court is determining whether a

MS. PILLARD:

It is different.

In Illinois v.

15

Gates, the Court said that there should be deference in

17

Now, it's -- it doesn't necessarily follow from

18

Gates that the court of appeals defers to the district

policy favoring warrants, a strong Fourth Amendment policy

22

that a search pursuant to a warrant is the preferred form

of privacy intrusion, and so to that extent, when you

24

don't have the magistrate issuing the warrant, you don't

have that form of deference.

follow that by saying, nonetheless, that isn't the way the

2

lower court viewed it and even though we think it would

3

have been better if they had concluded another way, we'll

4

let it stand, or they're going to say, yes, we think they

5

applied it rather badly, and it's so bad that we're going

6

to call it clear error, in which case they're not really

7

going to be following a clear error standard at all,

8

they're going to kind of jump into de novo whenever they

9

want to come up with an illustrative case, while still

10

11

calling it clear error.
Isn't that the kind of, sort of protean court of

12

appeals review that we're going to get, either a lot of

13

dicta, or a lot of departure from doing what we're saying

14

we're doing?

15

MR. ISAKOFF:

Well, it's certainly possible that

16

you could get that kind of review.

17

this could be the occasion for defining what a court of

18

appeals is supposed to do in performing a clearly

19

erroneous review, and when I was talking about questions

20

of law perhaps affecting the analysis of the probable

21

cause issue, I think of Justice Scalia's example of the

22

turntable, with whether or not you've got something,

23

whether it amounts to a search.

24
25

It seems to me that

That narrow question can be considered to be a
legal question, when you pick up the turntable and look at

1

the thing that's not in plain view.
QUESTION:

2

Yes, but the question in that case

3

was the degree of intrusion, and you're going to say,

4

well, there was just a wee bit of intrusion when he looked

5

under it, and therefore it was clearly erroneous to say

6

that you had not sort of departed from your reasonable

7

standard.

8

strikes me as sort of crossing the line into de novo

9

review, even though you're not saying that's what you're

10
11

That's kind of tough.

I think that that

doing.
MR. ISAKOFF:

Well, you -- there may be a

12

distinction between whether something constitutes a search

13

for purposes of whether you pick the de novo or clearly

14

erroneous review versus probable cause or reasonable

15

suspicion determinations.

16

And part of the reason for that is the history

17

that was recited by this Court in Illinois v. Gates, where

18

this Court had attempted to look for recurring fact

19

patterns and to try to develop a set of rules that would

20

provide the kind of guidance that opposing counsel have

21

suggested is provided in each one of these highly fact-

22

specific cases.

23

And the Court's experience was that it was

24

becoming impossible to kind of draw these distinctions on

25

appeal, and that we have to adopt a totality of the

1

circumstances rule specifically recognizing that these

2

fact patterns really do vary from situation to situation

3

and that, while you think you may be identifying a common

4

fact pattern, in fact there may be many, many variables.

5

QUESTION:

But that gets us into the different

6

issue which Ms. Pillard raised, and that is, there is a

7

good reason to have a more intrusive review standard when

8

one is reviewing a warrantless search than in the case of

9

a search with a warrant and therefore, even though it may

10

in fact, and I'm not sure I am convinced of this, but even

11

though it may, in fact, be more difficult, really, to do

12

de novo review, there's a good reason to do it in order to

13

preserve that distinction, isn't there?

14

MR. ISAKOFF:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. ISAKOFF:

Well, I --

You want to encourage warrants.
I think that there's a point that

17

is lost in that argument Ms. Pillard made, and that is

18

that nobody is talking about adopting the clearly

19

erroneous standard of review on appeal, of deferring to

20

the actions of a police officer.

21

that unless the police officer was clearly erroneous,

22

we're going to permit the evidence in.

23

Nobody is suggesting

extensive even than considered by magistrates, and the

2

whole point of it is that you're deferring not to a police

3

officer but to a district court.

4

And in terms of encouraging the exercise of

5

warrants, the very fact that there might be uncertainty in

6

the Seventh Circuit in this case as to whether or not,

7

when you have all of these circumstances, were they ever

8

to arise again, suggests that these police officers, if

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Isakoff, this is a typical sort

3

of a mixed fact-law matter, isn't it, probable cause and

4

reasonable suspicion?

5

MR. ISAKOFF:

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

And we certainly have traditionally

7

at least said that mixed questions of fact and law will be

8

reviewed by the appellate court on a de novo standard.

9

MR. ISAKOFF:

Well, I think that that's not

20

quite correct, Your Honor.

I think that in habeas corpus

21

cases, where you are defining what is a fact issue by

22

2254(d), which then goes back to Townsend v. Sain, and

23

where you're looking at how much you're going to give to

24

the State courts to do without independent Federal review

25

there, I think all -- in all of the situations where

1

you're looking at juror bias or that kind of thing, you

2

are saying mixed questions of fact and law are subject to

3

de novo review by a Federal district court in habeas

4

corpus, okay.

5

That's one situation.

But the other situation, even though it's the

6

same type of issue, I submit has been resolved differently

7

by this Court, that the criterion that the Court has used

8

is, who's in the best position to decide the question, and

9

is the decision going to be of precedential significance,

10

because as long as you're going to have three judges spend

11

their time trying to scratch their heads and decide

12

whether the court was right or not in close cases, you

13

ought to at least be getting something for it.

14

And I would suggest also that we are talking

15

about the close cases by definition, since it's only in

16

the cases where two permissible results could be the

17

outcome that there's a difference between the de novo

18

standard and the clearly erroneous standard, so it's hard

19

to see how you're going to get very many precedents coming

20

out of just those close cases.

21

QUESTION:

I had thought that our Bose line of

22

authority on the First Amendment, where we said that in

23

that area we will review these mixed questions de novo, I

24

had thought that was somewhat by way of exception, that we

at least implied that ordinarily that would not be the

case.

2

MR.

ISAKOFF:

Certainly the Bose and the

3

Hardhanks decision that followed it and Justice Stevens'

4

very clear language was that this was a unique interest

5

that's being protected by the actual malice standard,

6

this Court in particular has an obligation to be sure that

7

this core value of being able to criticize public

8

officials be given the fullest protection.
I would submit that,

9

that

in contrast to the probable

10

cause and reasonable suspicion type determinations, which

11

are specifically nontechnical in nature,

12

least this Court has giver, guidance perhaps in a series of

13

cases,

14

different type of issue, and I would agree that it is an

15

exception.

16

that until at

that the First Amendment cases simply pose a

QUESTION:

Is it -- this is -- I can't work out

17

how this makes any difference whether it's decided one way

18

or the other.

19

that the -- we're all agreed that any kind of question of

20

law that would require an elaboration of the law as

21

contrasted with simply applying a label to a set of facts

22

is for the court of appeals --

That's my basic problem.

23

MR. ISAKOFF:

QUESTION:

I mean,

Correct.

So we're only talking

about applying a label to the facts.

Now, if you were to lose on this, is this what

would happen?

Normally the district judge just says, the

panel was askew.

The defendant looked nervous.

There was an odd light shining through.

In the one case you're -- because

The panel was askew.

They don't

There is no way to say how much --

MR. ISAKOFF:

QUESTION:

Well, in fact --

-- in writing, and then as long as

10

that's true, we defer anyway at the court of appeals.

11

Whether you call it deferring on the basis that there

12

could be different factual findings on subtleties, or

13

whether you call it deferring on the ground that we're

14

supposed to give reasonable weight to their ultimate

15

finding, who cares?

16

MR. ISAKOFF:

Well, the difference, I think,

17

Justice Breyer, is that the -- you're supposed to be

18

reviewing a totality of the circumstances kind of a

19

judgment, and it seems to me that the district court is in

20

the best position because he's at least had the chance to

21

ask how askew, or even look at how askew, and then

weighing all of that together --

really is in the better position to do it, and then these

2

cases that are close, you're not really getting the

3

precedentially significant decisions out of the court of

4

appeals.

5

QUESTION:

Well, courts really were never

6

troubled with this problem until either some appellate

7

judges school said let's figure out what the standard of

8

review is, and then we say, well, it's deferential, or

9

it's de novo.

10
11

Courts never bothered to think about that

for a long time, and they got along fine.
MR. ISAKOFF:

Well, it's interesting, Your

12

Honor, because I think-that courts of appeals, whether

13

prompted by this Court or otherwise, have been paying much

14

more attention to standard review issues.

15

I know that, for example, the Third Circuit has

16

a rule that in every brief you must have a little

17

introductory section on the standard of review, and I was

18

in an oral argument last week where I was listening to

19

somebody else's case and they were saying, well, you know,

20

we might come out one way if it's abuse of discretion and

21

another way if it's de novo or if it's plenary.

22

And I think the courts of appeals are paying a

23

great deal of attention to it, and frankly I think they

24

are highlighting an issue of, you know, Federal judicial

administration here, really, who is in the best position

to decide these questions.
QUESTION:

2

3

Mr. Isakoff, doesn't this very case,

though, illustrate that the court of appeals sometimes is?

4

I'm really puzzled by the significance of the

5

labels, too, as are other people, but if I ever saw a nice

6

precedent it was Judge Posner's here, because he said, if

7

you have these four, five factors, and you didn't have the

8

two NADDIS hits, it wouldn't be enough.

9

So now the district court knows that this one,

10

two, three, four, five, if that's all you have, it's not

11

enough.

12

this is described as deferential review.

13

puzzling.

14

It's a really nice precedential decision, and yet

MR. ISAKOFF:

It's very

Well, I think what's deferential

15

is when you get to the bottom line, because the bottom

16

line in this case I think is arguably close.

17

I think at the point where if you leave out the

18

NADDIS hits and all you've got is an automobile in

19

Milwaukee with California license plates in December, and

20

that's all you've got, then what the court of appeals is

21

essentially saying is, if you found probable cause or

22

reasonable suspicion on that basis alone, we would be

23

saying that's clearly erroneous.

24
25

And I think that it underscores, frankly, that
the whole notion that the court of appeals must be

exercising de novo review in order to have this expositor

2

of the law function is wrong.

3

QUESTION:

Do you think maybe something like

4

this has been going on at least before we got the courts

5

of appeals got to the point of articulation, that in most

6

cases they did engage in deferential review?

7

Every once in a while they would get a case in

8

which they would say, the trial court seems to be straying

9

pretty far from what we generally think of as probable

10

cause here, and we've got to take this case as an

11

illustration to show that they should have analyzed their

12

facts differently, or concluded differently, or whatnot,

13

and in those cases they engaged in de novo review.

14

were selecting cases for de novo review, and that's the

15

way we've gotten along the way we've gotten along.

before we got to the labeling era, and b) would there be

21

anything wrong in leaving it that way and saying yes, you

22

can pick one out once in a while?

23

Would there be anything wrong with leaving a

MR. ISAKOFF:

Well, the only problem with

picking one out, Your Honor, is that I don't think the

courts of appeals have the luxury that this Court does of

2

picking and choosing the cases that come before it.
QUESTION:

No, I'm not saying that they pick and

3

choose the cases that come before them, but they do seem,

4

I think -- I'm guessing -- that they really did exercise

5

some discretion in deciding just how picky a standard to

6

apply when they did review them.

7

And if the reason for saying, in some cases

8

we're going to be fairly deferential but in others we're

9

going to be very picky because we think something can be

10

gained by using this as an illustration, if that's a

11

legitimate ground of choice, would it be wrong for us to

12

leave them to maks that choice, even though they have to

13

review, on one standard or another, every case that comes?

14

MR. ISAKOFF:

Well, I think Your Honor makes a

15

good point that, whether you call it clearly erroneous or

16

de novo review, the ultimate bottom line is, are you going

17

to -- do you think that the district court's in the better

18

position or not.

19

But I think that the development of these labels

20

has come to the point where these concepts have enough

21

meaning that when you've got the development of the law to

22

the point where probable cause and reasonable suspicion

23

have, and you see that it's a fact-bound area that resists

24

specific rules, that it's appropriate specifically to tell

25

the courts of appeals that this is an area where we think

1

that the district courts are in the better position, and

2

we don't think that in most cases you're going to have

3

much precedential significance to drawing the line in

4

these close cases one way or the other because these

5

situations are not going to arise exactly the same way

6

again.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Isakoff, can I ask you a question

8

that occurred to me listening to your opponents?

She

9

suggested that what this Court has, in fact, done in cases

10

like Brineger and all the airport search cases where they

11

reversed and so forth, they just explained -- the court

12

explained its conclusion why there was, in fact, probable

13

cause, and usually reversed in most of those cases I

14

remember.

15

But they never said anything about a deferential

16

standard.

17

imply that the Court itself, this Court, has applied a de

18

novo standard.

19

They just went ahead and did it, which seems to

MR. ISAKOFF:

Well, I think that -- I think

20

there's some truth to that, particularly when you go back

21

to cases as far as Brineger and before you had the history

22

that led up through Aguilar and Spinelli to Illinois v.

23

Gates, where I think there may have been a recognition

24

that the probable cause and reasonable suspicion

25

determinations were really not susceptible of the kind of
42

1

precedential significance that I think in Brineger the

2

majority of the Court found, and in that case, it was

3

different from that, Justice Stevens.

4

In that case, they lined up the facts in

5

Carroll, and they lined up the facts in Brineger, and they

6

said, unless we're going to say that this is for the trial

7

court to decide, we can't distinguish these, and therefore

8

we must reverse, and Justice Jackson in dissent made the

9

very point that I'm frankly arguing for today, which is

10

that the difference is that we only said in Carroll that

11

it was permissible to make this finding, and I think

12

that's a big difference.

13

In this case, I would affirm because it's

14

permissible, but you didn't have to find it, and I think

15

that that dissent was very prescient.

16

picked up the theme that later drove the Court's decision

17

in Illinois v. Gates to reject Aguilar and Spinelli.

18

I think that it

So I think that the law has progressed somewhat,

19

in that I think there is something useful to be said to

20

the courts of appeals and in response, I believe to

21

Justice Kennedy, there was a question, I believe whether

22

the Court should take into account deficiencies that a

23

clearly erroneous rule would have.

24
25

I would suggest that certainly that that would
not be a justification in and of itself.

I would suggest

1

that where the district court is in a better position to

2

decide the question and the courts of appeals are not

3

really making precedent, that it's certainly not

4

unreasonable to give the guidance to say, look, you don't

5

have to try to make these fine distinctions on appeal,

6

particularly since you weren't there to raise what

7

additional questions might have come to mind like, how

8

loose was the panel, and so on.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Isakoff, do you think it's

10

appropriate to have a different standard, whatever the

11

label is, to review more closely in a case where there is

12

no warrant?

13

MR. ISAKOFF:

I think that the district court,

14

in reviewing the case where there is no warrant, is not

15

going to be applying nearly the same kind of standard that

16

you would be doing on review of a magistrate's order.

17

other words, the district court will be using the word de

work of the police.

who's had the opportunity to ask the questions, to develop

2

the record as he or she sees fit, who is in a position to

3

make the kind of weighted assessment, and where you're

4

really not going to be getting -- look, if the district

5

court is wrong, and is clearly wrong, or has made a legal

6

error that affects the analysis or has said something

7

isn't a search when it is a search, then the clearly

8

erroneous standard is perfectly adequate to correct that.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Isakoff, this case presents a

10

situation where the magistrate made one finding of fact

evidence directly, made a different one, changed the

result.

QUESTION:

18
19

Well --

To whom should the appellate court

defer?
MR. ISAKOFF:

The appellate court should defer

to the district court for the following reason.
The district court was obliged, by reason of the

20

statute and this Court's decision in United States v.

21

Raddatz, to make a de novo determination, and as long as

22

he was not rejecting any credibility findings of the

23

magistrate, it's settled that he does not need to rehear

24

that testimony.

25

He certainly read, and it's clear that he did,

the testimony of the one officer who had felt this loose

panel and whose testimony was really the pivot point of

3

this case, and you know, we've -- the court in Anderson v.

4

Bessemer says you've got to defer to the trial court among

other things because the trial court's the one who

develops the expertise of doing this kind of fact­

QUESTION:

8

9

Is there any split of authority in

the circuits, to your knowledge, that turns on this

peculiar situation of the district court differing from

the magistrate?
MR. ISAKOFF:

13

Not that I'm aware of, because --

and I honestly don't know the answer to that.

QUESTION:

There's a lot of authority in the

the analogy, you'd say look, the reason that one wants to

1

there, and he listened to the story unfold, and that gives

2

him a degree of expertise in these matters, but there's

3

none here.

4

MR. ISAKOFF:

Well, there's two points.

First

5

of all, the expertise the Court was talking about in

6

Anderson v. Bessemer wasn't talking about expertise in the

7

particular case, but because that's the district court's

8

every day job, and the second point is that even though

9

the district court here chose not to hear any testimony,

10

he was certainly in a position to do so if he wanted,

11

which is not an option that was available to the court of

12

appeals.

13

QUESTION:

But as a court of appeals in this

14

case you'd say, what in heaven's name does the district

judge know that I don't know?

16

may know quite a lot that I don't, but not the district

17

judge.

18

MR. ISAKOFF:

Certainly the magistrate

There's no question that when you

19

look at this particular case you could reach that

20

conclusion and decide that, well, we ought to maybe have

21

one standard for when the district court hear's the

22

testimony and another standard for when the magistrate

23

hears the testimony, and yet another standard for when

24

they disagree with one another only on the label but not

25

on the credibility.

and the name of the case doesn't come to mind right now,

conclusion.

MR. ISAKOFF:

QUESTION:

7

Oh, I --

As -- do you understand that to be

the process of deference that goes on?
MR. ISAKOFF:

8

I certainly do not -- I'm not

9

aware of any decision of this Court that has suggested

0

that the deference is limited in the manner Your Honor

11

suggests.
I have certainly read Illinois v. Gates as

12

3

saying that there's a substantial basis for the warrant,

4

we're going to defer to the magistrate's decision to issue

5

it, and when you consider that that was then followed by

6

United States v. Leon, where a police officer acting, you

know, with a facially valid warrant is going to --

But that was a different policy,

I mean, that was the get-the-warrant policy as

opposed to the standard-of-review policy.

22

different policy because I --

policy --

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

3

MR. ISAKOFF:

-- that in both cases the Court

4

was coming very strongly, as it has historically, in favor

5

of encouraging people to get warrants.
QUESTION:

6

No, wait a minute, maybe I misspoke.

7

I thought in Leon the deference was to the capacity of the

8

police officer to believe that the warrant he had was a

9

validly issued warrant, so that it was in that respect

10

that the policy was different, isn't that correct?

11

MR. ISAKOFF:

QUESTION:

13

MR. ISAKOFF:

Yes.

I mean --

Okay.

you're looking at a police officer who knows that he has

lied to the magistrate --

MR. ISAKOFF:

Right.

Right.

-- that that would be a different

thing, but I think in both cases that there's no

suggesting has been limited to simply filling in the

blanks.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT G. LeBELL

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

5

MR. LeBELL:

It was suggested by Justice Souter

6

that in the past the practice has been by the circuit

7

courts of appeal that basically it's an ad hoc basis, and

8

that the determination whether it's going to be clearly

9

erroneous, or where it's going to be de novo, is sort of

10

on, we're going to call them as we see them, and I think

11

that's -- and the question was posed, why couldn't that

12

just continue to work.

13

I don't believe it could continue to work.

14

First of all, it --

15

QUESTION:

16

Has -- do you think that's what has

been going on --

MR. LeBELL:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. LeBELL:

As a practical matter?
-- prior to the labeling era?
Yes, Your Honor, I do.

As a

20

practical matter, that's precisely what has been going on,

21

and I think the resultant effect is that there is no

22

continuity in decisions, and there's a disparity in these

23

decisions and the application of Fourth Amendment

24

principles.

25

More importantly, it was posed by counsel that

1

perhaps this should be an opportunity for the Court to

2

more clearly define the definition of clearly erroneous,

3

as was announced in Bessemer.

4

I don't believe that there is any more workable

5

standard by which to determine when something is clearly

6

erroneous or is not.

7

setting a certain specific value, and basically what it

8

comes down to is a court of appeal judge saying, I think

9

this is clearly erroneous, and I think it's a totally

There's no way to quantify by

10

subjective standard, and I think it's unworkable in the

11

sense of saying we should leave it on an ad hoc basis.

12

Counsel also alludes to the principles

13

enunciated in Gates v. Illinois, and it is our position as

14

petitioners that to accord the clearly erroneous standard

15

in warrantless Fourth Amendment cases would be

16

inconsistent with the principles of Gates.

17

In Gates, obviously the Court, citing Ventresca,

18

was trying to encourage police officers, the front line

19

law enforcement individuals, to rely on the warrant.

20

now say to police officers, or send the same message,

21

well, if we're going to -- if you're going to rely on a

22

nonwarrant situation, basically we're going to accord the

23

same deference to that decision, I think it's --

But it's not his decision.

judge who favors them.

I'm not sure whether they'd be on your side or
It helps the district judge who

MR. LeBELL:

I believe that when the Court based

6

Gates on the belief that law enforcement officers were, in

7

fact, going to rely on warrants because they had been

8

given deference, I believe that principle was appropriate,

9

and I also conversely believe that the exact opposite

10
11
12

message is going to be disseminated by police officers.
QUESTION:

Why -- I mean -- and they pick the

judges they go to for the warrants, whereas they don't

3

pick the judge that's ultimately going to make this

4

determination.

MR. LeBELL:

Sometimes they pick the judges that

they go to for warrants.
