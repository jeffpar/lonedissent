ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL BENDER

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

11

MR. BENDER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
VMI, the Virginia Military Institute, was

12

established by the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1839 as a

13

State college for young men between the ages of 16 and 25.

14

Initially, its students were cadets who were assigned to

15

guard the State militia arsenal in Lexington, Virginia,

16

where VMI is located.

17

VMI since that time has remained a State

18

institution and in 1989-'90, for example, it contributed,

19

the State contributed about $10 million to VMI's operating

20

budget, that's about 35 percent of the budget, and the

21

Board of Visitors of VMI, which decides things like its

22

admissions policy, is appointed by the Governor and

23

confirmed by the legislature.

24
25

Although it has remained a State institution in
that way it has also, at the same time, enormously

broadened its educational mission so that it's no longer

2

just a place to produce cadets for the military.

3

today only about 15 percent of VMI graduates enter the

4

military.

5

medicine, engineering quite a lot, public service quite a

6

lot.

7

Indeed,

VMI graduates enter the professions, law,

While restricting VMI to men might have been

8

inevitable, indeed required at the time VMI was initially

9

established because the military at that time was all

10

male, as VMI's mission has broadened that's obviously no

11

longer true.

12

men, and continues only to admit men until this day.

13

VMI nevertheless has continued only to admit

During the 150 years or more of VMI's existence,

14

it has developed what everyone concedes is a unique,

15

adversative method of education.

form of education.

The VMI degree has, through that unique method,

become a very valuable asset in two ways, I think.

Many

people to hire.
QUESTION:

As you read the findings of the

3

district court and the assessment of those findings in the

4

court of appeals, what is your understanding of those

5

courts' conclusions as to the extent to which the

6

adversative method would be altered and affected by the

7

admission of women?

8

9
10

11
12

MR. BENDER:

I think there's general agreement

on what would have to be changed by the admission of women
in physical terms.
I think there isn't agreement about how to
characterize that.

For example --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BENDER:

There is not?
There is not agreement about how to

15

characterize the change.

16

for example, general agreement that for privacy reasons,

17

if women were admitted to VMI there would have to be an

18

opportunity for women and men to go to the toilet, to

19

shower, to dress, without being seen by members of the

20

opposite sex.

21

QUESTION:

I think the main -- there is,

Do we have the institutional

22

competence at this level and are we required in order to

23

decide this case to make our own assessment of the extent

24

to which the adversative method a) would change and b)

25

whether that change would be detrimental to the school?

MR. BENDER:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. BENDER:

4

No.
Is it for us to decide?
No, I don't think that's necessary-

in this case.

5

As you say, another change that is said would

6

have to occur is a change in the adversative method, and

7

that is something that I don't think is true, and that you

8

can only reach that conclusion that a change would have to

9

be in the adversative method by accepting certain

10

stereotypical characterizations of men and women.
QUESTION:

11

Didn't both of the lower courts make

12

that finding, that the effect of admitting women would be

13

to destroy the adversative method?

14

MR. BENDER:

15

QUESTION:

16

Yes.

I --

Now, you say that's wrong, but both

of the lower courts found that, didn't they?

17

MR. BENDER:

They -- that finding was based

18

entirely on a stereotypical view of women and men which

19

says that women - - men cannot administer the adversative

20

method to women, women would not be able to survive with

21

the adversative method.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. BENDER:

24

It was not based on expert testimony?

MR. BENDER:

-- exactly those characterizations.
I see.

All of these experts are --

can be dismissed as stereotypical.
MR. BENDER:

No,

they can't be dismissed as

stereotypical, Justice Scalia.
What does stereotypical mean?

When

7

anybody comes out and says something that is what?

What

8

makes it stereotypical?

6

9

QUESTION:

MR. BENDER:

It means what the experts really

10

said, which is not that all women can't do this, but that

11

most women can't do this, and we are willing to accept the

12

finding that most women can't do this.

13

The question in this case is whether, because

14

most women can't do it, you are constitutionally -- the

15

State is constitutionally entitled to exclude all women - -

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. BENDER:

18

QUESTION:

As I recall the experts --- even those women who can.
-- it was not that women can't do it,

19

it was that it would interfere with the kind of

20

relationship among the students that produces the

21

adversative method,

22

the same kind of adversariness that men and men or,

23

perhaps, women and women would, that the sexual difference

24

would make a difference.

25

that men and women would not engage in

QUESTION:

MR. BENDER:

6

That's right.
Well, I don't think, just as in the

area of race - -

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. BENDER:

9

It has to do with whether men will

And is that stereotypical, too?
Just as in the area of race, an

institution would not be able to remain uniracial by

10

saying, if you let black people into VMI, white students

11

would not feel comfortable in applying the adversative

12

method to them, or the other way around, if you let white

13

students into an all-black institution that has an

14

adversative method, black people will not feel comfortable

15

in applying the adversative method to them.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. BENDER:

18

can't.

19

Mr. Bender -Just as that cannot be used, this

Excuse me.
QUESTION:

It's a predictive thing, isn't it?

20

It's never been tried, so these are opinions of what might

21

be.

22

MR. BENDER:

What I'm saying is that even if you

23

accept them as opinions of what might be, 1) that they are

24

not opinions that are universal - - no one could say that

25

men universally would not be able to use the adversative

method on women, and to me more fundamentally it rests

2

upon men having a certain perception of what women are

3

capable of.

4
5

QUESTION:

And do you want us to make that

predictive judgment?

6

MR. BENDER:

7

QUESTION:

No.
As -- to the extent we're talking

8

about the remedy, I suppose we'd have a certain leeway to

9

do that.

10

11
12

MR. BENDER:

I don't want you to make the

predictive judgment.
I think what this Court is called upon to decide

13

is whether a State institution can model its program and

14

its exclusion of women on the assumption that there are

15

certain things that women can't do in general, there are

16

certain things that men will not do with women because

17

those men think that women are not capable of that, can

18

model its institution and its educational method on the

19

notion that this educational method, developed by men,

20

emphasizing what they think of as manly qualities, is a

21

place that women can't go, so that women cannot

22

demonstrate that they have the same qualities.

23

QUESTION:

Can it model it on the assumption

24

that many experts testified to that single sex education

has certain advantages - 9

the adversariness,

Well, why isn't that alone enough to

then?

Never mind the military, never mind
it's a men's college.

MR. BENDER:

Because, Justice Scalia,

in this

10

case what we have is not simply a single sex institution

11

for men and a single sex institution for women that are

12

equal in their treatment of their students,

You're not

1

challenging, then, the ability of a State to run a single

2

sex college.

3
4

MR. BENDER:

No, we are not challenging --we

are not -- it may be difficult --

5
6

That is not part of your argument.

QUESTION:

What it says here is that it's a

single sex military adversarial college, is that --

7

MR. BENDER:

That one is that, and that the

8

other is quite a different thing which teaches different

9

values and which teaches different capabilities in the

10

students.

11

In thinking about this case, Justice Scalia --

12

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Bender, we have two

13

separate questions, I think, one whether the original

14

finding of the lower courts that there was an equal

15

protection violation here of the Constitution for Virginia

16

to have VMI but no comparable program for women, whether

17

that was a correct determination and, secondly, I think we

18

have to decide whether Virginia's proposed remedy of the

19

development of the Mary Baldwin College program is

20

constitutionally adequate as a remedy.
And the discussion thus far doesn't really

21

22

direct us to either of those questions, and I notice that

23

in your brief the Solicitor General urges the Court to

24

adopt the highest standard of strict scrutiny to decide

25

this case.

Does your case depend on that?

MR. BENDER:

No.
Can it be decided, as the lower

courts did, on the basis of intermediate scrutiny --

MR. BENDER:

QUESTION:

6

MR. BENDER:

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- as the Court has done in the past?
Yes, absolutely.
Well, why is this case singled out,

then, for urging us to adopt some different standard?

What advantage is there - -

10

MR. BENDER:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BENDER:

:

The Court --- to that?
Justice O'Connor, the Court has

13

said repeatedly, I think on five different occasions over

14

the last 10 years or so, that the question of the standard

15

to be applied to gender discrimination is an open

16

question, and so we thought that the question might come

17

up of asking us what we thought the right standard is.

Well, it's not exactly an open

question in the sense that the Court has decided a number

of cases.

And if you look at Mississippi

to articulate a standard.

-- not only, Mr. Bender, is there

seems to me that strict scrutiny is inconsistent with what

with you for just a moment that you say there are certain

decide before deciding whether all gender classifications

would be subject to strict scrutiny.

the Court has made the decision that racial

classification, racial separation is inherently unequal.

5

The Court has never faced that question except in the

Vorchheimer case, which was affirmed by four to four, as

to whether the same thing is true in the gender area.

You're -- you started by

saying that single sex schools would be okay so long as

MR. BENDER:

Mr. Bender --- and we're going to have a single

sex school for women which is a nursing school.
QUESTION:

-- may I ask you specifically with

5

respect to this case, do you have any quarrel with Judge

6

Phillips, who said in dissent that if we were starting

7

from scratch we could have in this area what we couldn't

8

have in the race area, that is, genuine freedom of choice

9

plan, where you would have a VMI for both sexes, and you

10

would have a military academy for men and a military

11

academy for women, and we're starting them all on the same

12

day, and they all have equal funding and equal engineering

13

and math programs.

Would that be constitutional?

MR. BENDER:

We have no problem with that.
Then why doesn't -If they're equal.

understand it is coeducational, and we have VWIL, which is

19

one sex, and VMI, which is the other sex.

20

that fit --

MR. BENDER:

Why doesn't

Because they are enormously

different programs, in two ways.

One, the nature of the

program is different.

7

MR. BENDER:

The planning documents --

-- says that it's not appropriate

for most women.

Our point is not --we don't quarrel

9

with, because I think it's unknowable, whether it's

10

appropriate for most women or not most women.

11

is that it is inappropriate to say to a particular woman

13

because you're a woman.

Our point

In thinking about this case, Justice Scalia,

15

I've tried to relate it, as we're all trying to relate it

16

to our own situations and things we're familiar with.

17

I've tried to relate it to something that I've had some

18

experience with, which is legal education.

19

And I thought, what if a State set up a State

20

law school in 1839, all for men, because at that time only

21

men could be lawyers, and over 150 years it developed an

22

extremely adversative method of legal education, the

23

toughest kind of Socratic teaching, tremendous time

24

pressures, tremendous pressures in exams, tremendous

25

combativeness by the faculty, tremendous competitiveness

among the students, and developed a reputation for that.

2

And the graduates of that school -- and it was a

3

place that was known as hard to succeed at, and a third or

4

so of the people flunked out in the first year, and the

5

graduates of that school who survived that process became

6

known as expert leading lawyers and judges in that State

7

and Nationwide.

8

9

And then as women came into the legal profession
and started to apply to the school, to ask it to change

10

its admission policy, the school made a judgment that most

11

women really wouldn't be comfortable in this environment,

12

and the faculty would have trouble cross-examining them in

13

the same way they cross-examine women, and other students

14

would have difficulty relating to them in the same

15

competitive way, and so it's better not to let women into

16

the school.

17

What we'll do is, we'll set up a new women's law

18

school, and it won't have the tough Socratic method, it

19

will have a much warmer, a much more embracing

because Justice O'Connor has asked the question, an

We are saying that the State of Virginia, or the

Commonwealth of Virginia had three choices.

20

eliminate single sex education at all, altogether, by

21

allowing men -- by allowing women into VMI, and I will

22

come back to this point, but that would change the system

23

at VMI, and there wouldn't be single sex education.

24

other words, it would deprive both men and women of the

25

benefit of single sex education.

understand it.
What Virginia has decided, and the experts, both

8

9

the Government's experts and the private experts agree,

10

that single sex education is valuable for some young

11

people of both sexes, and there's no stereotypes

12

whatsoever made in that conclusion.

13

And so then Virginia has decided that as a

14

matter of education - - and this Court has said that the

15

most important function that a State can perform is

16

educating its young citizens.

17

educating its young citizens and performing that important

I don't think that that has been

MR. OLSON:

1

And I'd like to answer that

question.

3

answer to that question is best answered this way, is that

4

because we are each different, we each respond to

5

different educational methods and different educational

6

stimuli.

7

It's a very good question.

I think that the

The West Point program is designed to create

8

officers of the United States.

The VMI program is

9

designed to create leaders and adults who can operate in

10

the civilian or in the military world, who have a sense of

11

responsibility, the same goals, in other words, that the

12

VWIL program is set up to do.

13

The fact is that some young people do very well

14

in a coeducational program, and come out the other end to

be successful.

Mr. Olson, I think you're saying not

20

that there is a distinctive difference in the product, but

21

that there is a distinctive difference in the method of

23

that really does not answer the question.

QUESTION:

Let me put the question, or subsume

the question in something else.

4

It is -- isn't it true that the district court

5

judge never made any finding that there was a difference

6

in the kind of leadership product, if you want to use that

7

term, that VMI produces from what West Point or Annapolis

8

or the other military schools --

9

MR. OLSON:

That's correct, but it did make a

10

finding that this system and this methodology works for

11

the people that go to that school, and that --

12

QUESTION:

Okay, which goes to the point which

13

you made quite candidly, that you are resting your case

14

essentially on the position that this is a valuable method

15

of education because it serves a distinct group of people.

16

You are not resting your case on the proposition that it

17

is necessary to produce a distinctive kind of leader who

18

is produced by it and can only be produced by it.

19

MR. OLSON:

20

QUESTION:

I agree with you, yes.
Well then, why couldn't you say

21

exactly the same thing about ethnic or racial or any other

kind of -- religious, I mean, somebody could have a

certain curricula in a certain way, and once they're in

2

here they'll change the nature of that curricula because

3

they won't have the same backgrounds, et cetera, and

4

therefore we will use this unique kind of curriculum,

would be some truth to that.

of this thing?

group, any kind of a group.

13

That may be true

Isn't the answer to that, so what?

You'd have

14

to show that it's important enough to maintain this

shows it's important enough to maintain that --

QUESTION:

I don't mean to be facetious about

it, either.

that is so important about it that enables you to say to a

young woman I'm very sorry, even though you want to go

8

there and you want this result, you can't?

9

I want -- I'm serious about it.

MR. OLSON:

What is it

The answer -- the experts testified,

10

and people who are professional educators, who have spent

11

their life in education, saying that the system could not

12

exist.

13

It would fundamentally have to be changed.

The answer is that it works,

Justice Breyer, in a single sex environment for young men.

exactly identical to that, the people who spent their life

It will not work.

But if it --

13

QUESTION:

-- there's no stereotype, but isn't

14

it the case, as Justice Breyer said, that if you are going

15

to justify your system by its distinctness, then you

16

always have a built-in justification, because you can say,

17

if you change it, it's no longer distinct, the value is

18

gone, and that's why, it seems to me, under middle tier

19

scrutiny, you've got to say the distinctness is worth it

20

for some other reason.

21

MR. OLSON:

The distinction -- the

22

distinctiveness is worth it because young people educate

23

differently and we must, in this society, find ways to

24

educate them successfully, and we must develop systems,

Now, that is worth it.

I thought you

could, consistently with your position, and that is, if

you've got a school system in which everybody says the

results are terrible for everybody, and the school system

made a decision that in fact they would get better results
