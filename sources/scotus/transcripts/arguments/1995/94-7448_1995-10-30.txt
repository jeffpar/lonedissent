ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN E. UNTEREINER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. UNTEREINER:

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

These consolidated cases present the question of

12

what it means to use or carry a firearm both during and in

13

relation to a predicate drug trafficking offense.

14

Section

25(c) of title 18 of the U.S. Code

15

makes that conduct a crime punishable by stiff, mandatory

16

minimum sentences ranging from 5 years to life

17

imprisonment without release.

18

Petitioners Roland Bailey and Candisha Robinson

1

were each convicted of violating section

20

sentenced to 5 years imprisonment on that count.

21

convictions were upheld by a narrowly divided D.C. Circuit

sitting en banc.

carrying a small firearm known as a Derringer during and

2

in relation to the predicate offense of possession of

3

cocaine with intent to distribute it.

4

Her section 924(c) conviction rested almost

5

entirely on the fact that the Derringer was found unloaded

6

and in a holster inside a locked footlocker in her bedroom

7

closet.

8

touched the firearm, or that the firearm played any role

9

in any sale of narcotics.

There was no evidence that Ms. Robinson ever

QUESTION:

10

Mr. Untereiner, was -- are

petitioners in either of these cases challenging the

12

instructions on the law that were given?

13

MR. UNTEREINER:

14

QUESTION:

15

18

So in both cases it amounts to a

sufficiency of the evidence question for us?

16
17

No, we are not, Your Honor.

MR. UNTEREINER:

That's correct, Justice

0'Connor.
QUESTION:

And would you tell me what you think

19

the word carry means?

20

cases did the indictment or a jury have to decide whether

21

a weapon was being carried.

Apparently, in neither of these

included uses or carries, and so did he instructions in

2

this case.
We maintain that by carry, Congress meant to

3

bear on one's person.

5

QUESTION:

You don't think that under this

6

statute that a gun could be carried in the trunk of a

7

car - -

3

MR. UNTEREINER:

9

QUESTION:

-- for purposes of this statute?

MR. UNTEREINER:

10

No, we don't --

No, Your Honor.

We believe

11

that at most that would be transporting the weapon and, in

12

fact, if you look at section 924(b), Congress included the

13

word transport there, and we think there's a difference

14

between carrying and transporting.

15

The only discussion of this in the lower court's

16

opinion was in the dissent, and Judge Williams went

17

through an analysis why that was, at most, transporting.

18

QUESTION:

But if we agreed with you -- in the

19

Bailey case, if we agreed with you on use, we'd have to

20

remand, wouldn't we, because the lower court -- with the

21

exception of the one dissenting opinion, the lower court

22

didn't get into carrying.

23

MR. UNTEREINER:

Your Honor, we think that the

24

Court can and should reach the issue of what it means to

25

carry -5

QUESTION:

Yes, but we'd be doing it in the

first instance.
MR. UNTEREINER:

You would be, Your Honor,

that's correct, but we think the meaning is relatively
clear, of the word carries, and this Court is fully
capable of deciding what that means.
QUESTION:

Except that this Court operates as a

court of review and not first -MR. UNTEREINER:

Well, that's true, Your Honor.

It's possible that the Court could remand that issue, but
we think that the issue is presented in this case, and the
Court could also decide it.
Moreover, what the Government really tries to do
in this case is to ignore the word carry.

I think the

Government would like the Court to forget that the word
carry is in the statute, and the reason for that is fairly
simple, and that is that the Government's interpretation
of the word use reads the word carry -- carries out of the
statute.
According to the Government, whenever someone
possesses a firearm so that it emboldens the possessor, or
might be available for protection or security, that is a
use, and we submit that whenever someone carries a
firearm, the firearm is also available for use, and it
also emboldens the person, so if the Government is right

1

that Congress meant, by use, what it says, there really

2

would have been no need to include the word carries in the

3

statute.

4
5

This Court has repeatedly said that statutes
must be read so that every word is given some effect.
QUESTION:

6

Well, Mr. Untereiner, what is your

7

view as to the meaning of uses and the meaning of carries

8

in that phrase?
MR. UNTEREINER:

9

We suggest that the word use

10

means, to actively employ to carry out the predicate

11

offense.

12

discharging it, brandishing it, displaying it --

13

By active employment, we mean firing the weapon,

QUESTION:

Well, how about our opinion in the --

14

wasn't it in the Smith case where we said if you -- that

15

you use a weapon if you barter it for some drugs?

16
17
18
19
20

MR. UNTEREINER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

That's -- that was this Court's holding in Smith.
We think that that holding is fully consistent
with our definition of use.
In Smith, the Court held that trading a firearm

21

during and in relation to the predicate offense of

22

attempting to possess cocaine, trading a firearm for the

23

cocaine was a use of the firearm, and we think that was an

24

active employment to carry out the predicate offense.

25

QUESTION:

Well, how about a strategic placement

2

with whom the defendant is dealing in the case of a drug

3

sale has some notion of the power available to the

4

defendant at that time?

5

MR. UNTEREINER:

6

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor,

I think --

Some kind of -- I don't know how to

7

describe it better than a strategic placement of the

8

weapon.
MR. UNTEREINER:

9

I think if the weapon were

10

placed in an open area,

11

would fall within the meaning of active employment as we

12

understand it.
QUESTION:

13
14

and that

It doesn't have to be held in the

hand.
MR. UNTEREINER:

15
16

it would be displayed,

That's correct.

That's

correct.
But the Government makes much of placement.

says that possession plus placement should be enough to

qualify as liability for use,

MR. UNTEREINER:

That's right.

Within the

QUESTION:

10

You

At least shown -- it has to be at

least shown.
MR. UNTEREINER:

11

That's correct, and the reason

12

for that, if it's displayed, it's actually having an

13

effect in carrying out the predicate offense, whereas if

14

it's hidden somewhere, all it does is embolden the

15

possessor, and emboldening, we submit, really doesn't add

16

anything to possession.

17

QUESTION:

You mean, you would say the same if

this were a crack house with machine guns strategically

placed, to use Justice O'Connor's phrase, at various

points where they could be easily turned on anybody who

you have to draw a line some point, and so you want to

show that there was an actual, active employment, that it

was being used.

Suppose in the crack house example they had two

MR. UNTEREINER:

14

QUESTION:

No, that's correct.

Well, don't you concede, or isn't it

at least consistent with your theory to concede that there

can be an overlap between use and carry?

there's simply got to be a distinctive element in use as

There could be an overlap, and there

could have been an overlap in Justice Scalia's example.

Indeed, there is an overlap

under our theory of the statute and under the Government's

theory of the statute.

MR. UNTEREINER:

QUESTION:

Possibly.

If --

So in your view, use is broader than

carry.
MR. UNTEREINER:

No, Your Honor.

We think that

6

in general use is narrower than carry.

7

Congress -- that use means to actively deploy the weapon

8

as an instrument of the predicate offense, and carry was

9

intended to pick up a residual category of cases where the

10
11

That's what

weapon was not actually deployed.
QUESTION:

But I thought in your -- the

12

hypothetical about the weapon being visibly displayed it

wouldn't necessarily have to be on one's person.

14

it wouldn't be carried, but then it would be used.

In Smith,

QUESTION:

1

Your definition of carry is it's on

2

your person, because you excluded having it in the trunk.

3

Having it, say, in the seat next to you in the car

4

wouldn't do.
MR. UNTEREINER:

5

Well, we actually have two --

6

we have an alternative definition of carries which is

7

slightly broader, but nonetheless would not be a basis for

8

upholding Bailey's conviction under carry.

9

QUESTION:

But you want to concentrate here on

10

use, as I understand it, and from what you've been saying,

11

am I correct in gathering that use means, as you define

12

it, something perceivable by another human on the

13

premises?

14

MR. UNTEREINER:

It's activity with the -- it's

15

some kind of activity with the weapon that carries out --

16

assists in carrying out the predicate offense.

17

QUESTION:

In other words, a concealed weapon

18

can't be seen, so you say that's carry but not use.

perceives?

MR. UNTEREINER:

7

QUESTION:

That's correct.

I suppose you'd say you could use a

weapon without carrying it by having some remote -- remote

mechanism of discharge.

You could have a spring trap, or

all sorts of ways, have the gun fired from the other side

MR. UNTEREINER:

That's correct.

well that there's a difference between using a firearm and

7

merely intending that the firearm be used, or involving a

8

firearm in a predicate offense.

9

The Government's theory, however, would collapse

10

that, and essentially is based on the premise that

11

Congress doesn't know how to distinguish those things, and

12

rather, when it says use, it includes all of those things.

13

I'd like to say a little bit also about the Rule

14
15

of Lenity here.
QUESTION:

Before you get to that,

16

Mr. Untereiner, may I ask you how your definition, your

17

active definition of use, fits in with one of the

18

underlying crimes, and that's possession with intent to

19

distribute, which is a passive crime, no activity

20

involved, so how do you get an active use tied together

21

with such an offense?

22

MR. UNTEREINER:

Justice Ginsburg, it's quite

23

possible, we think, that a firearm can be actively

24

employed in a predicate offense of that kind.

brandish a firearm to ward off a rival drug dealer who's

You can

1

trying to take away the drugs, you could fire it, or you

2

could brandish it at the police who are trying to arrest

3

you, so it's quite possible that active employment goes

4

together with even a passive drug crime such as possession

5

with intent to distribute.
The Rule of Lenity is an important principle in

scope is uncertain should be reversed.

1

MR. UNTEREINER:

2

Well, I think in Smith, Your

3

Honor, the Court was looking at the statute as a whole,

4

and I think here again the language of section 924(d) was

5

significant because of this distinction between -- well,

6

the fact that that made cross-reference to crimes that

7

clearly involved trading firearms, and I think that, and I

8

think the Court, the majority in Smith was also somewhat

9

troubled with the possibility that bludgeoning someone

10

with a firearm might not be a use under the dissent's

11

theory.

Those considerations really --

No, we don't think that -- we think Smith is fully

consistent with our theory of active employment.

It may be, but with the argument

subsection (d), the forfeiture provision, where the word

reference to crimes where a firearm was traded, and I

that --

you agree that the trading of a firearm is an active use

If a

MR. UNTEREINER:

1

We think that that, the

2

language that, Justice Scalia, you've just read strongly

3

supports our position, because -- for a number of reasons.
Number 1, it shows that the phrase -- carry or

4
5

otherwise possess shows that carry is a particular kind of

6

possession, and that the only kind of possession that

7

Congress has made a crime under 924 (c) is carrying,

8

whereas the Government, I think, suggests that other kinds

9

of possession would qualify as use under 924 (c) .
The second half of that, discharge or otherwise

10
11

use, I think suggests under the various cannons of

12

construction that this Court otherwise applies that use is

13

a -- that discharge is a kind of use, and it must be of

14

the same kind, that the broader category, use, refers to a

15

kind of employment of the weapon that discharge is an

16

example of, and I think that's fully consistent with --

17

indeed,

18

of the statute.

19

I think it supports our active employment reading

We'd like to also remind the Court that, when

20

all is said and done, this case is really about a choice

21

between two sentencing regimes.

22

Guidelines, there's a two-level enhancement for possession

23

of a firearm, so really, if the Court accepts our argument

24

in this case, it doesn't mean that conduct like that

25

involved in this case will go unpunished.

Why should we prefer one to the other

MR. UNTEREINER:

Well, I think, Your Honor, that

10

the Court should strive not to read use in

11

that simply eradicates another provision of Federal law,

12

namely, the two-level enhancement provision.

Circuit supports you or is against you?
MR. UNTEREINER:

2

I think that case is clearly

3

distinguishable for two reasons, number 1, that was a case

4

about carrying.

5

that did not make that distinction, and seized on this

6

later language in that opinion that talked about

emboldening.
Number 2, the case was not about sufficiency of

8

9

A lot of the subsequent cases that cited

the evidence.

If you read that case carefully, you'll see

10

it was a case about an instructional error, and the court

11

reversed because the instruction was deficient, so any

12

statement in that case about the sufficiency of the

13

evidence, I mean, there was some discussion in there, but

it's not necessary to the outcome of that decision.

MR. UNTEREINER:

Because in -- because you

The predicate offense in Smith was attempt to

possess cocaine.

8

to trade what was in that case the machine gun for the

drugs, so we think that falls squarely within our

That attempt was carried out by offering

time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17
18

19

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Our position is that a firearm is used within

20

the meaning of section 924(c) when the defendant puts or

21

keeps it in a place where it is available to protect

22

himself during drug trafficking operations and to embolden

23

him to commit that offense, and we believe that, applying

24

that definition, the evidence was sufficient in both of

25

these cases to support petitioners' convictions.

1

QUESTION:

Is that an intentional part of the

2

crime, and that we infer that intent from all the

3

circumstances?

4

MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct, Justice Kennedy.

5

The jury was instructed that the use of the firearm had to

6

be knowing and intentional, and the evidence in this case

7

was sufficient for the jury to draw the inference that

8

Roland Bailey had the 9 millimeter Smith & Wesson

9

automatic pistol in his trunk to protect his possession of

10

cocaine and the proceeds of that drug trafficking, and

11

that Candisha Robinson had a Derringer in a locked foot

12

locker in her apartment bedroom, where drugs were kept and

13

from which drugs were dealt both on the day of the drug

14

trafficking crime that was charged in the indictment and

15

on the previous day.

16

So the jury could readily draw the inference

17

that the defendant, or the defendant's agents perhaps, in

18

Candisha Robinson's case, had put the firearm in that

19

place so that it would be available if the need arose

20

during the drug trafficking crime that was charged in

21

section 924(c).

22

QUESTION:

There was -- in Robinson's case, were

23

the drugs that were part of the transaction taken out of

24

that foot locker?

25

MR. DREEBEN:

The jury could draw that

1

inference, yes, because there was a drug transaction

2

within about a half-an-hour of the execution of the search

3

warrant, and after the search warrant was executed,

4

cocaine was found, crack cocaine was found in the trunk in

5

the bedroom, so the jury could -- and marked money from

6

that transaction was also found in that trunk.

7

So the jury could readily infer that Candisha

8

Robinson's agent, Parker, had gone to the trunk and had

9

retrieved the cocaine from that place, and during that

10

time had the gun available to him for the purpose of

11

protecting him if the need arose.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, you're not -- the

13

Government's not making the argument, I take it, that

14

having a gun in a locked trunk when the drug transaction

15

is being completed is enough to constitute its use.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, neither -- Justice Scalia,

offense of distribution.

QUESTION:

1

Now, suppose I keep the drugs under

2

my bed, and I have the gun in a locked trunk two rooms

3

away, in a closet.

4

Is that sufficient?

MR. DREEBEN:

That may not be sufficient for the

5

jury to draw the inference.

6

adopted by the D.C. Circuit in this case, two facts were

7

required to be established before the jury could draw the

8

inference.

9

Under the standard that was

First, the drugs and the gun had to be in

10

reasonable proximity to each other.

11

to each other, so that there should be -- there could be a

12

reasonable basis for the jury to conclude that the gun was

13

in a place where it could serve the protective purpose,

14

and second, it had to be accessible to the defendant when

15

the defendant was handling the drugs or the drug proceeds,

16

so that the jury could reasonably conclude that the

17

defendant did, indeed, knowingly and intentionally put or

18

keep the firearm there for the purpose of protecting his

stash of drugs.
QUESTION:

20

So in the case in which the drugs

MR. DREEBEN:

QUESTION:

I think that that

Why do they use use -- why do they

3

employ use, rather than possess?

4

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the evolution of the statute

5

I think reflects that originally the word use was put in

6

the statute to define one branch of liability which is

7

probably narrower than the liability that's currently in

8

the statute.
Originally, in 1968, the statute was written to

9
10

prohibit the use of a firearm to commit any felony which

11

can be prosecuted in Federal court, or carrying a gun

12

unlawfully during a felony, and those were two very

13

separate kinds of liability.
In 1984, Congress decided to merge those two

14
15

forms of liability, and to delete the very specific

16

qualifications that gave use and carry different

17

connotations.
QUESTION:

18

But they still have -- the statute

19

still has the qualification that the use or the carrying

20

must occur during and in relation to a drug trafficking

21

crime, a specific crime.

22

MR. DREEBEN:

23

QUESTION:

That's absolutely correct.

Which seems -- maybe I'm missing your

24

point.

It seems to me that that qualification renders the

mode of use, or the mode of carrying, as the statute was

2

before the amendment.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

No, I don't think that it does.

4

In fact, I think that the formulation that Congress chose,

5

use or carry during and in relation to, is a very, very

6

broad way of describing the nexus.

7

QUESTION:

MR. DREEBEN:

9

QUESTION:

10

Well, that's broad -That's right.

-- but the word crime is very

specific.
MR. DREEBEN:

11

Well, it is, and it depends on

12

what the crime is, and if the crime is one that takes

13

place only in a very brief span of time, such as assault

14

on a bank teller with a deadly weapon, then indeed you

have to find that the use is during that crime.

MR. DREEBEN:

I think, Justice Ginsburg,

that if

the requirement is added, during and in relation to,

the verb possess would probably pick up the same scope of

liability that we are describing, but that's -- it would

purpose if it had said possessed,

crime to the statute in 1986, it spoke of manufacturing,

20

distributing, or selling, I believe, verbs that left some

21

courts -- at least it left a legal issue open to litigate

22

about whether possession with intent to distribute was, in

fact, covered.

interpreting it so broadly that it swallows up the word

than the current statute, and carry only applied when a

firearm was carried unlawfully.

specifically took those restrictions off, and it merged

That's because the firearms

QUESTION:

In the real sense of use them.

6

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think that this Court in

Smith adopted the broadest reading of use that's

8

consistent with dictionary definitions.
QUESTION:

9

It was an active use, and you have

10

suggested that one might say the gun that's hidden in my

12

equally say about a gun that one has bought and never

13

fired, I bought a gun but I've never used it, or I don't

14

use it.

Those are two uses of the word use.

15

If we have a Rule of Lenity and it's a criminal

16

statute, why don't we pick the narrower one, the one that

17

implies active use?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think for several reasons,

Justice Ginsburg.

doesn't justify creating an ambiguity in a statute.

First of all, the Rule of Lenity

One is, it's in my drawer, I've never fired it, but I say,

section 924(c), had its natural, broad meaning without

3

additional qualifiers that limited it, such as active use.

4

Congress --

5

QUESTION:

But that was an active use,

6

Mr. Dreeben.

To trade the gun for drugs is a form of

7

active use, is it not?

8

MR. DREEBEN:

It is true, Justice O'Connor, that

9

it involved handling the firearm and trading it, but it is

10

not the first use of a firearm that springs to mind, and I

11

think the Court quite correctly recognized that it wasn't.

12

QUESTION:

No, but --

13

QUESTION:

Yes, but if the distinction is active

versus passive, it was an active use to the extent we're

concerned about that.

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I don't disagree with that,

but I think -QUESTION:

there still can be an ambiguity as between active and

suggested?
MR. DREEBEN:

Because the Court resolved the

3

issue in Smith not by saying that this was an active use,

4

and that's a requirement of the word, but by adopting the

5

definition of the word use that one finds if one looks to

6

dictionaries.

n

QUESTION:

Well, perhaps we were imprecise, and

8

perhaps Smith can be preserved without any difficulty if

9

we simply now recognize that Smith was a choice between

10

two active uses, and what we have here is a choice between

11

active and passive.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I don't think that that

13

would be consistent with the rationale that Smith used in

14

order to decide the case.

15

Smith relied on the fact that use entails more

16

than paradigmatic uses of a gun, that it covers the

17

natural dictionary meanings, and that it applies when

18

English speakers can understand that the object is being

19

put or employed for some purpose and in this case, all of

20

those requirements are satisfied.

21

I contend that the petitioner's position here is

22

analogous to the position that was taken by the defendant

23

in Smith, that you should add words to the statute to

24

limit what Congress has written, and that is not a reading

of the statute -42

1

QUESTION:

May I ask you one question?

2

The thing that gives the statute its breadth is

3

its coverage of passive use -- I mean, passive possession

4

with ultimate intent to sell -- and I suppose under your

5

theory anyone who has drugs in his or her home on a sort

6

of permanent basis, intending to sell some from time to

7

time, and who carries a gun when coming home at night, or

8

in case somebody might be there to steal the drugs, would

9

always be using the gun in connection with the

10

transaction, which would seem to me to mean that if a

11

person was in California, carrying the gun as he always

12

carries his gun with him, and the drugs are at home in New

13

York and found during a search pursuant to a warrant, he

14

would be liable under the statute.

like that, but if it's necessary for the Court to find a

Justice Stevens, is precisely the distinction that I would

suggest.

6

Again, I don't think that in the context of this

looks for a hypothetical to distinguish the two, because

Congress clearly had a broad objective in mind.

Well, Congress had a broad -- but

Well, without more facts, it's a

5

little hard to say, but I would think that you're right,

6

essentially most of these cases will go to the jury, and

7

the reason they go to the jury is that the firearms are

8

found in strategic places where they facilitate the

9

offense, and they inject the very danger and hazards that

10

guns have in these kinds of transactions that Congress

11

wanted to prohibit, and that is why we have treated these

cases as uses, as have all of the regional courts of

Well, our position is that the

19

word use didn't change its meaning, but the word use takes

20

its meaning from context, and in the original version of

21

this statute, use was embedded in the phrase, used to

22

commit any felony, and the connotation of used in that

23

context may require a higher linkage or more prepositive

24

use of the gun to actually carry out the crime.

25

In 1984, Congress deleted that qualification.

They

say that that happened because that was grammatical, in

context, and then they quote some legislative history,

4

what people said at the time that suggested that when they

5

defined carry, because they focused specifically on carry,

6

so they had some stuff there that suggests that it wasn't

7

intended to make a big difference, omitting those two

8

words, to commit.

They deleted it, that's right.

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I don't think that; there is

any legislative history that specifically addresses the

meaning of the term use and attempt to define it.

Congress addressed in the legislative history was the

1

committee addressed in the legislative history.
MR. DREEBEN:

2

I stand corrected, Justice Scalia.

3

The Senate committee gave several examples in the report

4

of how it thought the new statute would work, particularly

5

in conjunction with the main purpose of the overhaul,

6

which was to reverse the results in this Court's decisions

7

in United States v. Simpson and United States v. Busic,

8

which prohibited the application of 924(c) when the

9

underlying predicate felony had its own enhancement

10
11

provision.
And in the course of discussing that change,

12

Congress gave an example of how you could commit armed

13

bank robbery and be subject also to the offense of using

14

or carrying a firearm under section 924(c), and they added

15

a footnote to make clear that even if you didn't do what

16

is paradigmatically done to commit a bank robbery with a

17

weapon, namely point it or shoot it, you could still be

18

liable under the carrying prong, and the footnote -- the

19

footnote then continues to explain that the carrying prong

20

was broadened because the unlawfully aspect of the former

21

branch of liability under that provision had been deleted.

22

None of that was devoted to determining what

23

kinds of uses fell within the statute.

24

the footnote was to explain the ways in which the statute

25

had been broadened, and the final sentence of the footnote

The basic point of

1

that I think you're referring to simply made clear that if

2

there's no conjunction at all between the carrying of a

3

firearm and the underlying offense, but it was just there

4

coincidentally, then you're not liable at all, and I think

5

read in context, that committee report doesn't shed much

6

light at all on this issue.

7

What does shed light on the issue, I believe, is

8

that when Congress amended the statute in 1984, it

9

eliminated the qualifications on carrying liability,

10

namely, unlawfully, and on using liability, namely, using

11

to commit.

12

They had given them different connotations.
And as for your hypothetical, Justice Breyer,

13

about what it would mean if you put an ad in the paper and

14

said, I'm selling a firearm, not used, that would also

15

certainly be true if you had acquired the firearm because

16

it had been bartered for drugs but it had been contained

17

in shrink wrap.

18

The meaning of the word use in section 924(c) is

19

a broader meaning than that which could be applied in some

20

other context.

21

QUESTION:

Could you comment on petitioner's

22

argument with respect to subsection (d) of the statute,

23

which uses the term, involved in or used?

24
25

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think that the Smith

opinion explained why Congress chose the broader form,

involved in, in that forfeiture provision.

false statements on an application to acquire a firearm

3

license, the firearm is involved in that offense, although

4

it wouldn't be used in the offense, I think, on anybody's

5

understanding of that word, so the fact that there were

6

broader and additional verbs that were put in the

7

forfeiture provision really doesn't shed any light at all

8

on the meaning of use.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN E. UNTEREINER

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

15

MR. UNTEREINER:

I think that Justice O'Connor

16

put her finger on a critical flaw in the Government's

17

theory in this case, and that is that its interpretation

18

of use reads the word carries out of the statute.

19

the Government conceded that, that under its theory the

20

word carries has no independent meaning.

QUESTION:
like that?

it's very hard to kill something without injuring it.

MR. DREEBEN:

QUESTION:

There are statutes --

And so also it's, you know, it's hard

to use it without carrying it, so it's just making clear

6

that I don't only mean the big thing, kill, but even the

less thing, injure.

thing, carry but not use.

what this statute meant.

Under the Government's

In other words -- and I think Justice Breyer's

question pointed to this.

17

this case that prior to 1984 use and carry had, as they

18

put it, a fundamentally different meaning than it had

19

after 1984.

20

The Government also concedes in

That theory, we suggest, simply does not hold up

21

if you look at the available evidence, and it's somewhat

22

ironic, because the possession with intent -- well, the

23

drug trafficking offenses were -- although they were

24

included in the 1968 version of the statute, they were

25

eliminated in 1984, and they were added back in 1986, and
