ORAL ARGUMENT OF GRANT WOODS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
GENERAL WOODS:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is an inmate access to the court case.

10

The

11

State of Arizona meets and exceeds the requirements of

12

Bounds v. Smith by providing at the time of trial 26 law

13

libraries at nine separate prison complexes across the

14

State.

15

As the prison population has grown from more

16

than 15,000 to 22,000 prisoners, we have added seven more

17

libraries, for a total of 33.

18

adequate legal resources to the inmates through these law

19

libraries, Arizona goes above and beyond the requirements

20

of Bounds by facilitating the use of legal clerks and

21

legal assistants to obtain books and to help in the

22

preparation of lawsuits.

23

In addition to providing

Also, we encourage inmates to take our classes

24

to teach them to read English, and we find interpreters

25

for non-English-speaking inmates.

We facilitate also

1

assistance from family, from friends, outside lawyers and

2

paralegals and other prisoner rights groups.
Although deference to State officials in the

3
4

area of prison administration is required by this Court,

5

the district court in this case has imposed an order which

6

micromanagers virtually every aspect of prison life in

7

this area.
Additionally, the district court has entered its

8

9

order despite a record that has not established an injury

10

warranting systemic relief.

11

is overbroad, overreaching, and far beyond the

12

requirements of Bounds.

13

QUESTION:

The result is that the order

Mr. Woods, what are the findings of

14

the district court that would support a system-wide

15

violation of Bounds?

16

there was a system-wide violation of the requirements this

17

Court set forth in Bounds?

Was there any express finding that

GENERAL WOODS:

18

We believe there is not, Justice

19

O'Connor.

20

difficult for a variety of reasons, but one reason is

21

because it's difficult to separate pure findings of fact

22

from the judge's order, from how he has extrapolated that

23

based upon, we believe, his misinterpretation of what

24

Bounds requires.

25

The record in this case is difficult, and it's

If the Court --

QUESTION:

Well, you take the position that

1

Bounds was an either-or situation, that the State can

2

provide a library or assistance?

3

GENERAL WOODS:

4

QUESTION:

5

Yes.

Well, Bounds said that in so many

words, didn't it?
GENERAL WOODS:

6

Yes.

Mr. Chief Justice, I think

7

it's important for the Court to look at the reasoning

8

behind Bounds, and how it's been --

9

QUESTION:

Well, if you do that, I certainly

10

think there is some indication that a prisoner who cannot

11

read or who does not speak English might not have

12

meaningful access to a library even if it were there, and

13

you want us to take the position that there's no

14

requirement to provide any assistance at all.

15

GENERAL WOODS:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

We

16

believe that's the proper reading of Bounds, although

17

we

18

QUESTION:

You take the position that, if a

19

prisoner is illiterate or is illiterate in English, that

20

that -- that the requirements therefore are still

21

satisfied so long as there is, in fact, a library in

22

existence to which the prisoner could resort if he were

23

able to read it, or a legal helper to whom he could turn

24

if he were able to communicate?

25

GENERAL WOODS:

That's correct.

We believe

1

Arizona goes far beyond the requirement of Bounds, but we

2

believe that the proper interpretation of Bounds is that a

3

law library, in and of itself, is enough.

4

QUESTION:

Well --

5

QUESTION:

So there is no obligation to an

6

illiterate prisoner.
GENERAL WOODS:

7

The obligation is really not an

8

affirmative duty.

I think what we're asking the Court to

9

do is apply - - as the courts generally have over the past

10

18 years, apply the strict interpretation of bounds and

11

the language of Bounds.

12

QUESTION:

Well --

13

QUESTION:

But that turns -- I'm sorry, I keep

14

interrupting Justice --

15

QUESTION:

Go ahead -- no, go ahead.

16

QUESTION:

This will be my last question.

17

That, it seems to me turns the requirements even

18

in the strict either-or sense into pure formalities.

19

We're placing books in front of someone who cannot read

20

them, and we're placing legal helpers in front of someone

21

who cannot communicate with them.

22

senseless.

23

GENERAL WOODS:

24

QUESTION:

25

GENERAL WOODS:

That seems utterly

Justice Souter --

Why isn't it senseless?
This is wy we believe it's not.

1

This is -- again, you have to look at the reasoning behind

2

Bounds, and we believe the reason the Court ruled the way

3

it did in Bounds is, the Court was saying that what we

4

have to do is put prisoners on similar footing as they

5

would be for access to the courts to people who are not

6

incarcerated.

7

The State has taken a step in their lives that

8

has put a barrier to the courts, and therefore we have

9

to - - we have an affirmative duty to provide something

10

there, in this case a law library.

11

QUESTION:

Well, suppose we don't agree with you

12

on the meaning of Bounds, because there certainly is

13

language

14

do you have afallback position?

15

in it that speaks in terms of meaningful access,

GENERAL WOODS:

Yes, we do, Justice O'Connor,

16

and the fallback position is that Arizona goes above and

17

beyond the requirements of Bounds.

18

facilitate legal clerks, legal assistants.

19

you have to go to what we're talking about, and the Court

20

has said in - -

We're asking you to reverse the

findings of the district court, because Arizona has met

the requirements set forth in Bounds.

You're not making that

Yes, we are making that

We don't think you have to get to that, but if

you find -- that is another fallback position.
Clearly , in this case, if you found that we

13

were not in compliance with Bounds, and that some

14

remediation was appropriate, then you have to look at the

15
16

scope of the injunction and, of course, when you look at a
litany of cases from Dayton through the recent Jenkins

17

case, you see that this case is a perfect example of an

18

overbroad order.

20

23
24
25

Rather than finding a specific systemic injury
and trying to resolve that specific injury, what this
district court judge has done has basically decided how he
would micromanage the prison, to the point where he
decides where people sit and when, who goes, and when they
go to the library.
Telephone calls is just one example I would give

QUESTION:

He's mandating by this

General Woods, was there a point --

5

ever a point, after finding constitutional violation, at

6

which the State was asked to come up with a plan to cure

7

the violation, or was this directly referred to a special

8

master?

9

GENERAL WOODS:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, what the

10

district court did was, we had a prior ruling from him in

11

the Gluth case which was just applicable to one prison

12

unit and, again, micromanaged the entire unit much as this

13

order does.

14

He told us that he - - his plan was to put this

15

order in place throughout the State, and he gave us the

16

opportunity to make any objections which we wanted to,

17

which we did, but the ball game was over at that point.

18

QUESTION:

But before that, isn't it usual in

19

these situations to give the State the first opportunity

20

to present a remedial plan?

21

GENERAL WOODS:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and

22

that's exactly what Bounds requires, is that -- that you

23

will give deference to the States, and the States will be

24

allowed to formulate their own plans.

25

QUESTION:

master?

GENERAL WOODS:

We anticipated that that would

4

be how -- the answer is yes, but we were not allowed to do

5

so.

wanted to the Gluth decision being imposed upon us State­

QUESTION:

15

GENERAL WOODS:

16

QUESTION:

We're --

Mr. Woods, Attorney General Woods -Yes, sir.

-- did you give consideration, or

17

have any of the people who have written in this field in

18

the scholarly community given any consideration to whether

19

or not the library requirement makes sense at all?

20

It seems to me that maybe libraries might be a

21

waste, and that there might be much better, more efficient

22

ways in which to provide prisoners some assistance.

23

GENERAL WOODS:

I think we've -- we've

24

considered that, and I think these things will change with

25

the advent of computers and technology changing, where the

old style law library may some day be a thing of the past,

2

but what the Bounds court told us was that we could choose

3

between a law library or - - and I believe the disjunctive

4

was used something like 10 times in the decision -- or

5

some other form of legal assistance.

6

Most States have chosen a law library, and --

7

QUESTION:

Well, I'm asking whether or not other

8

forms of legal assistance were considered by you.

It

9

seems to me you're defending your position, advancing your

10

position on the theory that your library facilities were

11

adequate.

12

have any other prisoners, prison systems taken the

13

position, that the library requirement is just fanciful,

14

what prisoners need are small books with forms and a

15

couple of people to tell them how to fill them out.

16

You have not taken the position, I take it, and

GENERAL WOODS:

I don't know specifically if

17

anyone has been bold enough to do that, Your Honor, in the

18

face of the Bounds decision.

for 18 years we're required to do a law library.

with too minimal of a plan for fear that it wouldn't meet

QUESTION:

Have there been any studies on the

4

effectiveness of prison libraries?

GENERAL WOODS:

i 6

8

Well, there have been -- there

have been commentators who have commentated upon it, but I
don't know that that's particularly persuasive.
I think that the Bounds court understood, we

have to assume that the Bounds court understood that there

10

are illiterate and not English-speaking prisoners in every

11

prison in the United States.

12

now, there always will be, and the point is --

13

QUESTION:

There were then, there are

General Woods, isn't it the case that

14

in Bounds the district judge would have preferred some

15

other form of legal assistance?

16

decided that the library was a better way for it to go.

17

This Court mentioned both, but the district court in that

18

case, I thought, had made it clear that he thought it

19

would be a much better idea to provide some form of legal

20

assistance other than Federal reporters, State reporters

21

on a shelf.

22

GENERAL WOODS:

It was the State that

I believe that's correct,

23

Justice Ginsburg, and this Court, as -- following the

24

direction that it has given ever since then, deferred to

In other words, you're defending your position,

10

or advocating your position based on the adequacy of the

11

library system.

12

GENERAL WOODS:

Yes, we have, and Justice

13

Kennedy, let me make it clear why we believe it is

14

adequate, and why this 18-year period of the States

15

complying with Bounds mainly with law libraries is

16

sufficient, and it's because we put people on equal

17

footing as to the people who have not committed crimes and

18

who are not in prison.

19

And then, what they can do on the outside, if a

20

person is illiterate, if a person doesn't speak English,

21

and they live in Phoenix but they haven't committed a

22

crime, they haven't murdered anybody, they're not

GENERAL WOODS:

Justice Stevens, I would apply

3

the Turner analysis here, because we do not allow them

4

simply to walk up and use the phone, because again, most

of the calls --

6

QUESTION:

No, I understand that, but are you

7

saying there was no evidentiary basis for a finding of

8

violation of constitutional rights in denying adequate use

9

of the phone?

It maybe should have been much less than

10

they allowed, but are you saying there was no evidence of

11

a violation at all?

12

GENERAL WOODS:

There's no evidence of a

13

systemic violation, because what we found was that there

14

were a - - I think there were two inmates who said that

15

their confidentiality was violated because they asked the

16

guard to leave the room and he wouldn't.

testified differently, but he believed the prisoner.

QUESTION:

right to make phone calls out of prison?

I don't believe you have that.

22

that we allow them to do that.

That's correct.

didn't want to do that you could simply -QUESTION:

Well, most of the argument in the

15

briefs is not about whether there was a violation, but

16

rather about whether he was overly ambitious in the relief

17

he granted.

18

GENERAL WOODS:

Well, I think what we tried to

19

point out when we talked about injury in the brief is

20

that, again, going back to Jenkins and Dayton, City of Los

21

Angeles v. Lyons where one, two or three instances when

General Woods, are you attacking --

you're saying the findings themselves were not sufficient,

or the evidence beneath them, because I think you told us

that these findings didn't originate with the judge, that

they were, indeed, I think you said verbatim what were

GENERAL WOODS:

GENERAL WOODS:

QUESTION:

Yes.

The -- following up on what Justice

21

Stevens said, as I read this, and your opponents say this,

at the heart of this decree -- there are a lot of

provisions to it, and I think your opponents, to my

reading, concede that some are overreaching, but at the

25

heart of it lie 261 prisoners who are locked up, and what

1

I think it found is, respect to those who were locked up

2

in solitary confinement, or whatever, that often they can

3

only ask for one or two law books at a time, and there are

4

frequently long delays, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, and

5

sometimes weeks before they get those one or two law

6

books.

7

That seems supported in the record, and your

8

opponents concede that we could modify the decree in that

9

respect, and they don't have to be escorted across the

10

place.

All they have to have, on page 39, is some

11

effective method, all right.

12

The second major part of this was the Hispanic

13

population, and possibly the illiterates, and as for the

14

Hispanic population, there are a lot of them, and there

15

are findings that the Hispanic people cannot read these

16

law books and are not given proper assistance of any sort,

17

such as organizing other Hispanic bilingual prisoners, and

18

the decree in that respect didn't require too much.

19

simply required that they get down to figuring out how

20

these Hispanic people systematically could rely on

21

bilingual prisoners to help them out.

22

All right.

It

At least as to those two key

23

matters, which I think everyone thinks are at the heart of

this, is there any argument that we - - I mean, why

Well --

Which is either to modify or to

affirm those two key provisions, and then systematically,

it wouldn't take too long, go through the other ones and

evidence?

GENERAL WOODS:

Your Honor, I think regarding

the lockdown prisoners, then I believe there clearly we're

11

QUESTION:

What they were complaining about --

12

GENERAL WOODS:

QUESTION:

GENERAL WOODS:

Yes.

-- was just what I said.
I understand that.

That means,

15

I believe, that you go to the Turner analysis and you have

16

to see in that case a whole variety of things, and also,

even under the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of injury,

you have to find injury.

Isn't that injury?

GENERAL WOODS:

If that was the case, Your

Honor, I think Arizona would have a bigger problem, but

5

that's not the case, and that is not even what this court

QUESTION:

7

What do you mean by a bigger problem?

8

Do you concede, General Woods, that a lockdown prisoner is

9

entitled to have law books, even for matters that have

10

nothing to do with a collateral attack on his conviction?
*

11

GENERAL WOODS:

12

QUESTION:

I think that --

Even for matters that have nothing to

13

do with the Constitution, he's entitled to that as one of

14

his basic needs like food, housing, shelter, medical care,

15

and a lawyer?

GENERAL WOODS:

16
17

Is -- you've made that concession?
No, I don't make that

concession.
QUESTION:

18

Well then, what about the -- wanting

19

law books either for collateral attacks on his conviction

20

or because he feels he's being treated in an unlawful

21

manner?

I imagine people don't read these books for their

22

health.

I assume they have a reason for wanting them.

23

GENERAL WOODS:

Once again, Justice Breyer, the

24

reason I point to first the necessity for systemic injury

25

is because the findings here by the judge were that many

times - - he used the word many - - they had to wait a

2

long -- longer period of time.

3
4
5

Also he found, though, that it's very clear the
policy in Arizona is they get their books within 24 hours.
QUESTION:

That may be the policy, but what he

6

found happened was that they are routinely denied physical

7

access, there are often long delays in receiving books,

8

and then there's a lot of testimony in that respect.

9

GENERAL WOODS:

Often long delays, the policy is

10

24 hours, and the record shows from the testimony that

11

that is generally what happens.

12

somewhere in a prison you can find 9 days, 7 days, the

13

Bureau of Prisons' own policy from their brief is 3 to 4

14

days, and we're doing 24 hours.

15

QUESTION:

The fact that sometimes

But General Woods, isn't it

16

inevitable that if the State takes the position that it's

17

going to comply with Bounds by having a library system,

18

that you're going to get decrees like this?

19

If I were a district judge, and I read the

20

requirement of the Supreme Court that you have to have a

21

law library, the first thing I'd do probably is make up a

22

list of the books that ought to be in the law library, and

23

how often it ought to be open, and all we're doing is just

24

arguing about details.

25

It seems to me that once you accept the

requirement of Bounds that you have an affirmative

2

obligation to provide a library, we're going to be talking

3

up here --we may disagree on exactly how long it ought to

4

be open, and how much of a delay is acceptable, but it

5

just seems to me the district judge is essentially correct

6

in most of what he said if there's an affirmative

7

obligation to provide a library.

8

9

GENERAL WOODS:

Well, we don't believe that --

that that is the case, that the case is that if we provide

10

a reasonably adequate law library that that's enough, and

11

you don't have to micromanage it from there.

If it pleases the Court, I would like to reserve
the rest of my - -

kinds of legal as opposed to factual issues here, that the

18

the required level of access and so on, and whether you

have an affirmative obligation.

The other one you've touched upon a couple of

times by reference to Turner, and that is, how do we

measure sort of what, kind of the reasonable level of

Did you go to the district court at any time and

to apply Bounds in the light of Turner, which sort of

look, we not only have to apply Bounds here, we have

to both sides of the equation.

GENERAL WOODS:

Did you

The answer is yes, we did, and I

think I - - it appears that the district court judge simply

had his own version of this expansive reading of Bounds

10

and never applied any other test whatsoever.
QUESTION:

11

Okay.

Would -- on what I'm calling

here sort of the second issue,

issue if you want to, do you believe it would be

appropriate for us to return the case to the Ninth Circuit

a consideration of Turner?

MS. ALEXANDER:

7

please the Court:
Before I start trying to talk systematically

8

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

about this case, I'd like to respond to a few of the
questions from General Woods' discussion.
First, I think the basic finding here was that

11
12

the vast majority of adult prisoners have no adequate

13

means to research and present their papers in court, and

14

that was made up specific findings and a number of

15

elements.

16

How the lockdown system - - the system as to how

17

the great majority of prisoners actually got the books

18

from the library, inability to use them, how the staffing

19

worked in the system, how the law clerks, who, by the way,

20

have no role in research, worked, how the supposed one

21

source of legal assistance worked, that is the prisoner

22

legal assistance, and what the sources for illiterate and

23

Spanish-speaking prisoners were.

24
25

I want to point out also that in the defendants'
reply brief they said that they were not challenging any

1

of the findings of the district court as clearly

2

erroneous, and I want to further point out that a number

3

of the findings, and these actually from the district

4

court, if one goes back, both parties submitted findings,

5

a number of the findings actually came from defendants.
I want to further say that I do not believe that

6

7

the order -- that the record supports a claim that the

8

State asked for some different form of developing the

9

remedy.

10

I do not believe that there is anything at all

that would support that.

QUESTION:

I thought that --

I thought that the claim was they had

been applied more narrowly shouldn't be expanded State­

wide .

MS. ALEXANDER:

Is that inaccurate?

MS. ALEXANDER:

Can you point me to that?
I would certainly agree that

there is no place anywhere in the court's findings in the

orders is breathtaking.

scope.

Your Honor, if I could take that

apart just a bit, I agree that the noise provision goes

too far, and I have no problem with just simply getting

rid of it, but the claim that somehow it prohibits their

QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Alexander, on a broader

level -- I think Justice O'Connor has raised this -- my

reading of the district court order and I believe of the

single citation to Turner.
Do you claim that - - let me ask you two

don't see where that comes from.

6

MS. ALEXANDER:

Actually I think Estelle,

Mr. Chief Justice, is a good illustration of how this

8

principle works, because there is no obligation for the

9

person who's bleeding on the street for the State to do

10
11

something because the State hasn't been involved in that.
But there is an affirmative obligation on the

In Bounds it comes from the fact

that the right of access to courts is the most fundamental

Quite literally and specifically,

Turner v. Satley describes Johnson v. Avery, the earlier

13

right of access case, as involving a First Amendment

petition right.

15

I notice that

I think the reason that one could describe it

16

best as a due process right is that it has various

elements.

elements, for a person who has already been convicted, of

petitions to redress grievances, and for those reasons I

So what, in your view, should this Court do if

Procedure.

There is evidence that those

How many instances of that were

Was it two?
MS. ALEXANDER:

12

Your Honor, that is a

13

misunderstanding that the defendants first put forward in

14

their reply brief.

15

If one looks at the findings of the district

16

court on this point, it's not that there were two

17

incidents, it is that prisoners, plural, were unable to

18

file their cases.

dismissed.

20

Prisoners, plural, had their cases

Now, it is the case that the judge cites on this

the evidence in this case showed.

other witnesses who testified to similar events, and I

some obligation, if he's going to give a system-wide

2

remedy, to say this is the reason I find a systemic

3

violation, that there were not just two prisoners who

4

failed to get their books, but that there were 26?
MS. ALEXANDER:

5

Your Honor, I believe that he

6

did make systemic findings, and given that the defendants

7

specifically say in their reply brief we are not

8

challenging any of the findings of the district court as

9

clearly erroneous, I think this issue is at an end.
QUESTION:

10

Okay, but if you say, prisoners are

11

not getting books, is it two prisoners, is it -- you can't

12

challenge that finding as clearly erroneous if only two

13

got it, because two is a plural, so you can't challenge

14

that, and yet it doesn't lay the groundwork for a systemic

15

violation.

16

MS. ALEXANDER:

Well, I think what I would see

17

as the missing step in this, the two, we disagree, that's

18

not what's involved, but in any event, these are cases in

19

which someone had actually had his or her constitutional

20

rights impaired, but the question the district judge ought

21

to be addressing is a different one, is there threatened

22

injury from the class when I see that these harms have

23

occurred, that this same system is operating the way I

would expect this flawed system to operate, and therefore

QUESTION

What if all the harms

QUESTION:

Ms. Alexander --

QUESTION:

No --

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't it satisfy the

Constitution if prisoners were allowed to file whatever

6

they want to file and provided access to forms so that

7

they could file, and secondly, they were also provided

8

access to legal advice, period?

else.

No books, no anything

They have the forms, you fill out a form, we'll

mail it for you, and moreover, you can have legal advice

12

about any particular issues you want to discuss, any

13

particular constitutional issues you want to discuss,

maltreatment in prison, your conviction was void for some

15

reason.
MS. ALEXANDER:

16

For some prisoners that might

well provide meaningful access, but for a prisoner who

18

cannot write, the opportunity to be given legal advice and

19

to be given form books just doesn't work to --

I'll add that, that legal advice and

the lawyer will fill out the form for you if you can't

write.

MS. ALEXANDER:

The -- in fact, I would say that

24

the best systems are those systems that rely on something

25

like that, rely on using direct sources of assistance.

2

So that would be good, and you could

get rid of the library.
MS. ALEXANDER:

3

Oh, absolutely.

We have no

4

attachment to law libraries.

5

libraries are not the best way to provide access, but in

6

some sense what Bounds does here is helpful, because it

7

gives us something to measure access by.
Does the prisoner have the access that is

Personally, I think law

equivalent to what a literate prisoner given access to a

law library would have?

standard.

That ought to be the appropriate

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GRANT WOODS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

GENERAL WOODS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

18

First, there were no -- there was no showing of

19

actual injury by any lockdown inmates.

20

Two would not be enough for a systemic remedy, but there

21

were none.

QUESTION:

It wasn't two.

I count 30 -- 29 in those footnotes.

GENERAL WOODS:

1

This is the question, Justice

2

Breyer.

We do not believe that delay is actual injury.

3

We're talking about whether somebody actually had a case

4

or a cause of action somehow impaired because of delay.
Prisoners, the one thing they have in abundance

5
6

is time, and if it takes 4 or 5 days and they have a

7

statute of limitations of 300 days, they are not impaired.
Secondly, Turner has to be applied to the

8

9

lockdown situation.

That, I think, is crystal clear, that

10

first Turner wasn't applied, and if it is applied, that

11

there is a legitimate penalogical interest in saying that

12

you can't have an unlimited amount of books in a cell,

13

that you can't have them for an unlimited amount of time,

14

and that our system, where - - which was place at this

15

time, and Exhibit 85 shows that legal assistance would go

16

and help these people if they were illiterate or if they

17

just wanted any book, that that is a reasonable system,

18

and Turner has to be applied to lockdown, and that

19

lockdown situation isn't just in Arizona, it's in every

20

prison, and in fact ours is better than the Bureau of

21

Prisons.
I think the whole point here -- I'd like to

22

23

conclude and ask the Court to consider what Arizona has

24

done and what most States has done is, we've met your

25

precedent.

We've said, we have a law library and it's an
