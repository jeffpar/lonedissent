CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

next in Number 94-1654, The Board of County Commissioners

5

of Wabaunsee County, Kansas, v. Keen Umbehr.
Mr. Patterson, you may proceed whenever you're

ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD PATTERSON

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PATTERSON:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is a First Amendment case.

12

It involves the

13

interest and the responsibility of local government in

14

making the decisions in the course of governing and in the

15

course of delivering government services that have an

16

economic impact on contractors.

17

interest of a contractor who engages in what I will refer

18

to as protected activity, activity protected by the First

19

Amendment, and for convenience I'd like to refer to that

20

as a local contractor, if I may.
QUESTION:

21

22

It also involves the

Mr. Patterson, it's not a case

involving any issue of political patronage, is it?

23

MR. PATTERSON:

No, it is not.

24

out.

25

could almost say it's the opposite.

This is not a patronage case.

We can rule that

In fact, I think you

QUESTION:

MR. PATTERSON:

3

QUESTION:

4

It's a free speech case --

In the context of an independent

contractor.

5

MR. PATTERSON:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. PATTERSON:

8

QUESTION:

9

Exactly.

Exactly.

With the county.
That's exactly what it is.

I thought our patronage cases were

decided as free speech cases under the First Amendment.

10

What were they decided under if it wasn't under that

11

provision?

12

MR. PATTERSON:

I think they were.

The question

13

I was asked was whether or not this was a patronage case,

14

and it's not.

15

It is a free speech case.

QUESTION:

Well, I understand that the free

16

speech in question was not free speech regarding partisan

17

politics, but why would that make any difference?

18

would you distinguish the patronage cases?

19

decided as First Amendment cases.

20

MR. PATTERSON:

Amendment case, and probably not.

22

Amendment cases -QUESTION:

They're

They are a form of First

21

23

How

They are First

So you think we could hold for you in

24

this case, but in a later case where the contractor says,

1

Democratic, we could allow that contract to be denied,

2

because after all, the speech in this case is partisan

3

political speech and it's okay to discriminate against

4

that.
MR. PATTERSON:

5

It depends upon how the contour

6

of the First Amendment right is defined in terms of the

7

language of the First Amendment, which uses the word,

8

abridging.
QUESTION:

MR. PATTERSON:

10
11
12

Well -To me, it comes right down to

that.
QUESTION:

One way to distinguish the cases like

13

Elrod and Rutan from this case, certainly, is to say that

14

on the other side of the ledger in the political patronage

15

cases, if I may refer to them as that, there was the

16

interest in political organization and that sort of a

17

thing that apparently is not present here.

18

MR. PATTERSON:

It is not, and I believe that

1

probably is the answer to the question over here, to

20

Justice Scalia's question.

21

This doesn't involve a question of party

22

loyalty, anybody's political philosophy.

23

First Amendment rights that were exercised were on other

24

subjects, that's all.

25

It doesn't.

The

Now, I think that the balance of these interests

1

is required by the fact that government, local government

2

in particular, in the course of making government

3

decisions and delivering government services, requires

4

them to make decisions that have an economic impact on

5

contractors and potential contractors.

6

When the contractor who exercises First

7

Amendment rights is adversely affected by a decision that

8

gives him the potential of saying, foul, you have harmed

9

me, and it is retaliatory against me, how is that conflict

10
11

to be resolved?
We suggest that the term of bridging really has

12

two different components.

One, of course, is the interest

13

of government.

14

perform the functions that is expected of it by the people

15

who voted them there to continue if they have to live

16

under the threat of intent determination, motive

17

determination litigation, and the question is, can it?

To what extent, and how is its ability to

18

The second component, I think, is the end result

19

of government action on the person who exercises his First

20

Amendment rights.

21

position that is no different and equal to the position of

22

his comparators in similar situations?

23

Is it an abridgement if he is left in a

QUESTION:

Now, you have acknowledged in your

24

response to the Chief Justice that this is to some extent

25

a balancing question.

It's not an absolute right.

you have in patronage cases, you say, a greater interest

2

on the part of government, you may not apply the same rule

3

you're urging on us here, and you may allow the

4

discrimination on a partisan basis, right?
MR. PATTERSON:

5
6

the same.

All right.

The core question is

It's the ability --

7

QUESTION:

But you balance to some extent.

8

MR. PATTERSON:

9

QUESTION:

Yes, you do.

You do.

Well, why don't you balance on the

10

other end as well?

You assert that this case is just like

11

a Federal employee, just like a government employee

12

case --

13

MR. PATTERSON:

14

QUESTION:

No --

-- and that, you know, similar

15

rules -- is having the Government contract as important as

16

having a Government job?

17

MR. PATTERSON:

The core interest of government

18

is essentially the same, the ability to continue its

19

services.

20

think are different because of the different legal

21

relationship and the different economic relationship

22

between contractors and Government and employees and the

23

Government.

The mechanics by which that are achieved I

the person asserting the First Amendment right.

2

being deprived of in one set of cases is employment by the

3

Government, which is livelihood, which is bread on the

4

table.

5

MR. PATTERSON:

6

QUESTION:

What he's

Okay.

Isn't that somewhat -- isn't that a

7

much greater interest than being deprived of a contract

8

with the Government?

9
10
11

MR. PATTERSON:

It is, and in -- that's

particularly true in this case.
QUESTION:

Well, why is it?

Why is a -- for

12

example, wouldn't it just have to say, it depends?

13

mean, why -- a temporary employee, somebody who is

14

provisionally hired for 6 months at a government summer

15

camp I take it is protected in that 6-month job by the

16

First Amendment.

MR. PATTERSON:

QUESTION:

It could be.

While McDonnell-Douglas, which

19

employs 400,000 people -- I'm making that up, obviously,

20

but their lifeblood depending on this contract, I take it

21

under your theory you have to concede that the First

22

Amendment would apply to what the 4-month employee at the

23

summer camp, there provisionally, might happen to say, but

24

on your theory it wouldn't apply to all of McDonnell-

California depends, so I mean, how can we say that one in

principle is more important than the other?
MR. PATTERSON:

Well,

I think that it's a

question of degree, and I believe this Court has

5

previously said that degrees -QUESTION:

But, remember, the Court has talked

about the First Amendment applying to protect probationary

employees.

MR. PATTERSON:

Yes, that's right.

People who don't have permanent jobs.

Who are there just for a moment.
I'm about to address that.

I

14

think the issue is whether or not he has been harmed as

15

compared with other equally situated comparators.

16

The employee who is shut out, or not given the

17

job for which he applies, sure, he's harmed, as compared

18

with other employees, but in this case, what happened?

This contractor -- and you have to go back into

the facts of the case.

between Mr. Umbehr and six cities, that's all.

paid him nothing.

1

that there are just certain contractors that are free of

2

the First Amendment --

3

MR. PATTERSON:

No.

My point is that in this

4

second component of abridgement, the contractor has to be

5

left in a position that is less than the position of his

6

silent comparators, and in this case he was not.

7

basic complaint was that the playing field on which he had

8

to compete with other contractors for the same business

9

was leveled.
QUESTION:

10

His

I thought this was a -- not a

11

rebidding of the contract, I thought it was a continuation

12

of the contract, and what your clients did was to cancel

13

it.

MR. PATTERSON:

That -- those were not the

facts, Your Honor.

They terminated it.

1

MR. PATTERSON:

2

QUESTION:

It would have.

So this wasn't a mere matter of, as I

3

think you were saying to Justice Breyer, of leaving this

4

contractor in the position that he would have been in

5

relation to other intending contractors, if your clients

6

had done nothing.

7

readjustment of the contractor's position.

8

9

It was, in fact, a considerable

MR. PATTERSON:

It was, because what the

readjustment that occurred was that he lost his

10

competitive edge that he had over other equally situated

11

contractors.

12

QUESTION:

May I go to a different question?

3

You alluded a moment ago to the Government interest.

4

the case of the Government's interest when dealing with an

5

employee, in the kind of obvious case, one is concerned

6

about the capacity of the Government to continue to

7

function administratively within government offices when

8

someone is disruptively criticizing.

9

What is the Government interest here?

In

How,

20

specifically in this case, was the county rendered at a

21

disadvantage in doing whatever it did in relation to trash

22

merely by the fact that this contractor was saying

23

critical things about them in relation to trash at open

24

meetings and all sorts of things.

25

less able to function?

Why were they rendered

(800) FOR DEPO

MR. PATTERSON:

1

The specific answer to your

2

question is that it had nothing to do with hauling trash,

3

because under this contract Mr. Umbehr hauled no county

4

trash and the county paid him nothing -QUESTION:

5

Well, regardless of whose trash he

6

was hauling, how was the county rendered less able to

7

function in doing the things that it did by virtue of this

8

criticism?

9

In other words, I'm saying how do you create a

10

parallel between this situation and Pickering, if you're

11

going to argue for a balancing test?

12

MR. PATTERSON:

It impaired their ability to

13

terminate what they perceived was a contractual

14

relationship that was no longer needed.

15

of the county's time.

16

QUESTION:

It took up a lot

They received no benefit from it.
Well, are we just arguing about facts

17

in this case?

18

saying, we didn't terminate the contract because of all

19

the nasty things he was saying, we terminated the contract

20

because we didn't need a contract any more.

21

In other words, the county is simply

MR. PATTERSON:

No.

That gets into the issue of

22

motive determination, which admittedly is a fact issue in

23

the event this is ever --

24
25

QUESTION:

Okay, so if that's not what the case

is about, let's assume that the speech was at least in

1

some respect a factor in the county's decision.

2

MR. PATTERSON:

3

QUESTION:

4

For here we assume that.

How did the remarks that he made make

it difficult for the county to function?
MR. PATTERSON:

5

If the county made the decision

6

that the service they were providing -- that is, getting

7

Mr. Umbehr and the six cities together on a contract was

8

no longer needed, the question is whether or not the First

9

Amendment empowers the contractor who uses his First

10

Amendment rights, to continue that practice even though

11

it's not -QUESTION:

12

No, the question is, how does it make

13

it hard for the county to function?

14

interest?

15

MR. PATTERSON:

What's the county's

Okay, it makes it harder for the

16

county to function because of the threat and expense of

17

motive determination --

18

QUESTION:

In other words, you're saying there

19

should be no recognition of a First Amendment right

20

because First Amendment litigation is difficult and

21

troublesome?

22

23

MR. PATTERSON:
begging the question.

QUESTION:

25

(Laughter)

No, I think that would be

I think it's a question -I do, too, but I --

QUESTION:

1

May I just ask you this, is it your

2

view that because First Amendment litigation is expensive

3

for the county, they have to prove their motive was

4

something other than retaliation for the speech, but what

5

if they wanted to have a policy that would remove the fact

6

issue and they just published an announced policy, we will

7

not do business with any trash haulers who criticize

8

members of the county board?

9

If they were very candid about their feelings,

10

we don't want to do business with people who criticize us,

11

would that be permissible?
MR. PATTERSON:

12

I think that would come very

13

close to a prior restraint, and my answer to that would be

14

probably not.

15

QUESTION:

Well then, the difference between

16

that case and this one is just one that you have to try

17

out the facts to find out what the real motive is in this

18

case, and the one I hypothesized, we all know what the

19

motive is.

20

MR. PATTERSON:

21

QUESTION:

22

But see, they've alleged the motive

similar to the one I describe.

23

MR. PATTERSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well --

That's true.

And it seems to me on a motion to

dismiss we have to assume those allegations are true, so

I'm not sure there's a distinction between my case and

this one.
MR. PATTERSON:

Well,

I think the difference is

this.

word.
QUESTION:

8

9

I think it's a question of how the contours of the

Now, that's the First Amendment

Mr. Patterson, the answer that you

just gave, it seems to me inconsistent with what you said

10

earlier about the level playing field, because if the

11

Government had this policy that applied equally to all

12

contractors, if you're going to be consistent with the

13

position you were taking, wouldn't you have to say, well,

14

that's okay, because they're all being treated the same?

15

MR. PATTERSON:

I think that's a different

16

issue.

17

that deals with the interest of the contractor.

18

there simply was that --

19
20
21

That's -- that goes to the component of abridging

QUESTION:

But if this contractor isn't harmed

in your view then no other question is relevant.
MR. PATTERSON:

Well, except that they -- that

is another question.

23

it's our contention that he has --

Then he wouldn't be harmed whether

talking about the facts of this case, in which I might say

contractors come in all sizes and shapes, some are very

I think --

rights and be critical of how the county used county

I think the difference lies in

No.

I think that the likelihood

but that's not what this case is here for.

20

MR. PATTERSON:

Well, as I perceive it, the

21

question here is how and to what extent the contour of

First Amendment right really is on the part of a

contractor in dealing with government with which he

2

concern, can define his own benefit for which, if he is

3

denied, he has the right to go to Government and say, pay

4

me my demand or pay my damages, take your choice.
QUESTION:

5

Well, but the contractor, the

6

governmental agency always has the right -- perhaps it has

7

to be pursued through litigation -- of saying, we are not

8

dismissing him, we're not discontinuing him because of his

9

speech, we're discontinuing him because of unsatisfactory

10

performance, or failure to perform.
MR. PATTERSON:

11

All right.

That would be a

12

reason.

13

that the Government in making decisions should be free of

14

that kind of threat of motive determination litigation if

15

there is objectively legitimate government reason for

16

making the decision they made.

17

That would be a reason, and what we suggest is

QUESTION:

Now, that's --

Why doesn't that argument apply to

18

any decision that the Government might make with respect

19

to any citizen on any subject?

20

Why should there be -- in effect, on that

21

argument, why should we conclude that there would be no

22

right, in effect, to criticize the Government, that the

23

Government would be able to take retaliatory action so

long as it had an objective basis for taking the original

25

action that the individual criticized?

MR. PATTERSON:

QUESTION:

MR. PATTERSON:

Well --

-- out of the system?
I think it's a question of

7

whether or not the contour of the First Amendment right of

8

the ordinary citizen who has no contractual right with the

9

Government is the same as the contour of the First

10

Amendment right of the contractor who does wish to do

11

business with the Government.

12

QUESTION:

Well, if you want to draw a

13

distinction between the citizen and the contractor, you've

14

got to start at least by identifying an interest on the

15

part of the Government which would justify, at least

16

arguably justify drawing that distinction, and the only

17

interest that I've heard in the course of this argument is

18

an interest in avoiding litigation.

19

Is there any other government interest, when the

20

Government is dealing with an independent contractor, and

21

I'm assuming in my question that it's not an independent

3

I think an argument can be made, and

feel free to differ, that the Government's interest in the

If you have an employee in the district

9

things are really balled up here, or something like that,

10

it really can impair the efficiency and operation of that

office as well as its reputation, but it seems to me if

12

you have an independent contractor saying things are wrong

13

with the --no one attributes those remarks to the agency

itself.

15

perhaps the county doesn't have the same interest in

wanting to present a united front among its employees.

It's much more of an adversary situation, and

MR. PATTERSON:

Oh, I think the threat to

government is different in a contractor situation than it

19

is in an employee situation, and you hit upon the exact

of litigation that's unmanageable, it's not a very good

2

demonstration.
MR. VAN KIRK:

3

No.

I think what is a good

4

demonstration, however, Your Honor, is the fact that these

5

claims are currently available, as we suggest, in a number

6

of circuits, and there still is not a flood of litigation,

7

and I think what actually occurs, independent contractors

8

generally are afraid of antagonizing what is not only the

9

sovereign but their business partners, and as a result

10

there is some limitation on their willingness to bring

suit.

MR. VAN KIRK:

We think not a Pickering-type

2

balance because it does not -- it underprotects speech in

3

this particular context.

4

QUESTION:

Each of this Court's --

Well, not necessarily.

We're living

5

in an age where government is trying to do more and more

6

government functions by way of private contracting, and

7

nonetheless perform services that government traditionally

8

performs, and when they contract with private people to

9

perform those services, why shouldn't the interest be very

10
11

much like that of an employee?
MR. VAN KIRK:

I think that that's true, in

12

those situations where we're dealing with independent

13

contractors that are essentially the equivalent of an

14

employee, there is no reason --

15

QUESTION:

And I suppose in connection with

16

trash-hauling we might think that that was a traditional

17

public function.

18

MR. VAN KIRK:

I would suggest there is a

19

difference between traditional public function and the

20

degree to which an employee or an individual is

21

incorporated within the Government's own operations, the

22

degree of interference that their speech may cause.

There's some nexus or connection between the speech and

the potential disruption.

QUESTION:

2

Yes, but if somebody comes around and

3

picks up my trash at home, I'm going to assume it's some

kind of government service being provided, so government

5

might have a real reason to treat even a private

6

contractor in that context like an employee.

7

MR. VAN KIRK:

I think that the Government has

8

some interest in considering the speech of independent

9

contractors.

It has a much less interest, in response to

10

your question about whether Pickering provides the

11

appropriate analysis, in situations like this.
QUESTION:

12

What if the public contractor, or the

hired contractor hauling trash in Justice O'Connor's

from, vote Republican, or vote Socialist, or something

like that, and the county says, we just don't want our

QUESTION:

9

You're saying, then, I think, that

when the independent contractor is not functionally like

an employee in the office that the only real issue is

whether the contractor is performing the contract or not.
MR. VAN KIRK:

13

Yes, that's absolutely correct,

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

Thank you, Mr. Van Kirk.

MS. BRINKMANN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to first address a number of

10

administrative problems that Justice Breyer asked about.

11

I think it's important to focus on that question on the

12

other side of the issue here, and that's the First

13

Amendment speech that's at issue here.

14

This is speech that lies at the core of the

15

First Amendment.

17

have information and to have an informed opinion about

18

government functioning because of their relationship with

19

the Government.

It's speech on matters of public

The Court recognized that --

22

Scalia's hypothetical with the contract guards?

24

the Government, their use of Government assets and

Government payments, to have access to the community which

When -Suppose they say, we don't want you

8

discussing any matters of public concern because you have

9

a special privilege, going in to homes, that we are giving

10

you, and we do not want you to exercise that on our

11

behalf?

12

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, we believe that the

13

Government certainly would have a right to terminate a

14

contract if that provision was necessary to the effective

15

performance of the contract.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

No, I will stipulate that out of the

hypothetical.
MS. BRINKMANN:

If it was content-based, we

19

don't believe that that is the kind of action that the

20

Government can take.

21

QUESTION:

What if the Government -- and I think

22

this is the direction Justice Kennedy was going in.

What

23

if the Government says, look, people who are having their

24

garbage picked up do not want to have to listen to

25

political harangues from you.

Don't talk about politics

That's not an answer to Justice

Yes, how about that term?

Don't talk

politics to homeowners when you're picking up their
garbage.

Violation?
MS. BRINKMANN:

We believe that because of the

12

content-based nature of it there would have to be some

13

kind of stronger Government interest.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

What's content-based about that?

Just don't talk any kind of politics.
MS. BRINKMANN:

I guess it's how you define

17

politics, Your Honor.

18

gossiping or other kind of speech that could have that

19

same effect and excluded political speech, that would be a

20

content-based restriction.

QUESTION:

If it permitted neighborhood

But in any case, that is for the --

22

Don't

you want to.

If it were limited to one topic

we think that would raise problems of content-based

QUESTION:

Suppose it would limit --

7

QUESTION:

And if there is no restriction on the

8

speech, then as between the Boy Scouts and the KKK the

9

Government can't discriminate between the two, right?

10

MS. BRINKMANN:

11

QUESTION:

Your Honor --

Assuming it's making no speech

12

restrictions, the Government can't say we'd rather have

13

the Boy Scouts do it?

14
15

MS. BRINKMANN:

I think that it really depends

on the contract we're talking about, Your Honor.

16

QUESTION:

It's a contract to pick up garbage,

17

and we know that there's going to be a lot of political

discussion, okay.

MS. BRINKMANN:

QUESTION:

No, the contract isn't that.

It's a

something like that, and it cannot decline to give that

MS. BRINKMANN:

interest is what's central to determining what analysis

should be applied in these cases.

16

18

QUESTION:

A good argument for restricting the

scope of Government.
MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, Your Honor, we believe

19

that the Government's interest in the performance of a

20

contract can effectively be protected by the Government

21

being free to take any action when the Government can

establish that it materially and directly impairs the

performance of the contract.

That's correct.

can't you?

That's correct, Your Honor,

I also think that on those questions -QUESTION:

It looks at the context of each case, and

QUESTION:

So you think the Pickering rule

applies to this -- to independent contractors?
MS. BRINKMANN:

No.

We don't think that the

8

deference that is given the Government's interest as an

9

employer that underlies Pickering applies here.

10

QUESTION:

Well, that's an extraordinary

11

argument for the Government to be making.

12

Federal Government is going to be getting the same

13

deference as a county commission, and it seems to me

14

extraordinary for the Federal Government to come in and

15

say, we don't think we get much deference under the

16

Constitution.

17

MS. BRINKMANN:

Certainly the

Your Honor, we -- the Federal

18

Government has no interest in having contractor speech

19

attributed to it.

20

As you pointed out earlier, one of the

21

differences in the Government interests between the

22

employee situation and the contractor situation is whether

23

the speaker's speech is attributed to the Government.

24

Government doesn't have any interest in policing

1

a very different situation with the employment context,

2

where the Government has the interest that Pickering

3

recognized.

4

QUESTION:

Well, when I think of all the

5

contracts the Government must have, the Federal

6

Government, I can't imagine that some situation wouldn't

7

arise where there's going to be some issue like this, and

8

you're saying, in effect, we want the most stringent rule

9

possible to be invoked against the Government, and here

10
11

you are a Government attorney.
MS. BRINKMANN:

I should restate my position,

12

Your Honor.

13

contracting situation is equivalent to an employment

14

context, Pickering should apply.

15

We think when the relationship in the

QUESTION:

Well, let's suppose a government

16

contract to provide security guard services in a public

17

housing project, do you think the Government can discharge

18

the contractor because the people are members of the

19

Nation of Islam, for that reason?

MS. BRINKMANN:

1

concern was a substantial motivating factor in the

2

Government's action, where the Government could establish

3

as a matter of fact that that speech materially and

4

directly impaired the performance of the contract.

5

In that particular situation, if it was in the

6

context where residents of that housing authority did not

7

believe that the security guards would prevent them, it

8

somehow impaired a trust relationship between security

9

guards and the --

QUESTION:

What test are we employing here, a

Pickering balance test, is that what you're arguing for?
MS. BRINKMANN:

It's a balancing test of the

interest between the Government and the speaker, but I --

14

QUESTION:

A Pickering-type test?

15

MS. BRINKMANN:

It's not Pickering in the sense,

16

Your Honor, that the inherent interest underlying

17

Pickering, the Government's interest in coworker

18

relationship, in supervisory discipline, and in the

19

functioning of a work place where they're all Government

20

employees there, that is a weight that is given a lot of

21

deference in Pickering.

22

I normally think that when people are talking

23

about Pickering balancing, that's always in the scale, and

24

that would not be in the balance when we talk in terms of

Government contractors.
