ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ZAIMES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. ZAIMES:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case, after all the briefing on a wide

12

range of issues, remains a statutory interpretation case,

13

and the guidance that this Court has previously given on

14

how to resolve such cases, particularly where Congress has

15

provided strict -- excuse me -- direct indications of its

16

intent in several ways, we think charts a very clear path

17

for how the case should be resolved.

18

Let me digress for just a moment to talk about

19

the facts in this case that are at this- stage undisputed.

20

They are -- this is still a pleading case, notwithstanding

21

the many twists and turns that it has been through.

22

The case concerns a small commercial property

23

located on a street corner in Los Angeles that was owned

24

by petitioners from 1963 to 1975.

25

the property to respondent in 1975.

The petitioners sold

tenant on the property for about 10 years before that,

2

since 1965, and had operated a Kentucky Fried Chicken

3

store on the property.
In 1988 respondent decided that it would

4
5

bulldoze, that Kentucky Fried Chicken store and bulldoze

6

also the strip mall that was alongside it and put a brand

7

new store on the property -- it was going to be a two-

8

story, art deco, specially designed store -- and in the

9

course of that work discovered contamination on the

10

property by refined petroleum product.

11

October 1988.

That was in

12

The respondent fully cleaned up the

13

contamination in a matter of months, by March 1989, and

14

gave notice to petitioners under the Resource Conservation

15

and Recovery Act, what we call RCRA in shorthand, in May

16

1990 .

17

It was not, though, until December 1991, more

18

than 3 years after the contamination had been discovered,

19

that respondent commenced its first aut-ion in State court

20

alleging in toto 10 different causes of action, most of

21

them sounding in common law, but two under State statutes.

QUESTION:

Was the cleanup done pursuant to an

order of the municipality?
MR. ZAIMES:

It was done pursuant to -- it was

done under the supervision of the County of Los Angeles,

was an order in effect at the time that the cleanup was

done, but they had general oversight -QUESTION:

Had a building permit been

conditioned on the cleanup?
MR. ZAIMES:

I don't believe that there

8

The --

9

QUESTION:

So, the respondent was under really a

10

legal duty to clean up the property, at least if the

11

building permit were going to be granted.
MR. ZAIMES:

12

I'm not sure if that is an

3

allegation of the complaint, but I believe that that would

4

have been the state of facts at the time that the cleanup

5

was done.

6

After two successful demurrers by petitioners,

7

that case went up on appeal to the State court and this

8

action was filed in the Federal district court in LA

9

alleging a single cause of action under-the Resource

20
21

Conservation and Recovery Act.

That was in May

992.

Now, it is Congress' intent in the citizen

22

supervision of that statute that we are here to determine,

23

and we believe that the congressional intent derives from

24

several sources, including the plain words of the

25

jurisdictional statement of the statute, other related

1

sections of the statute, the legislative history of the

2

statute itself -QUESTION:

3

Well, Mr. Zaimes, there are two

4

potential questions that I guess we might resolve, and I'm

5

not sure if we have to resolve them both or not.
One has to do with the statutory requirement

6

7

that an imminent and substantial endangerment be alleged.

8

MR. ZAIMES:

9

QUESTION:

10

Yes.
And that may possibly be decisive for

our purposes of this case.
The other has to do with what's recoverable,

11
12

assuming there is a valid claim made, and the extent of a

13

court's equitable authority.

What does that cover?

14

Are you going to address both those issues?

15

MR. ZAIMES:

16

issues.

17
18
19

I am going to address both of those

QUESTION:

And do we need to decide both in your

view?
MR. ZAIMES:

I believe you do-need to decide

20

both, and the primary reason that you need to decide both

21

is that part of the way that this case has come to this

22

Court is that there is a conflict in the circuits.

23

Ninth Circuit has fundamentally determined that as to the

24

second issue, what type of relief is available under the

25

statute, that a cost recovery action may be pursued.

1

Eighth Circuit has determined precisely the opposite.
QUESTION:

2

That's the question on which there is

3

a split of authority.

4

MR. ZAIMES:

That is the question on which there

5

is a split of authority.

6

split on the imminent and substantial endangerment.

8

QUESTION:

It is less clear that there's a

Doesn't the Ninth Circuit create the

split?

9

MR. ZAIMES:
QUESTION:

10

I'm sorry, Justice Breyer?
Doesn't the Ninth Circuit create the

11

split on the question of when the endangerment had to take

12

place?

13

MR. ZAIMES:

My recollection of -- the Ninth

14

Circuit says the endangerment can be in the past or in the

15

present.

16

QUESTION:

Right.

17

MR. ZAIMES:

Now, I'm not sure that the Eighth

18

Circuit reached the issue of whether it has to be past or

19

present directly.

20

analysis of whether there was an implied right of action

21

for damages in the case.

It relied more on the Cort v. Ash

In addition to the words of the statute, we have

I'm just not quite clear

because if we say that the Ninth Circuit was wrong about

when the endangerment must be, if we say it is an

imminent, yet-to-be-realized danger, why do we have to

4

answer any other question?

5

MR. ZAIMES:

6

The Ninth Circuit is then

Well, that resolves the situation,

7

Justice Ginsburg, for my client I agree.

8

that that resolves the remainder of the Ninth Circuit's

9

decision.

I'm not sure

If you were to only reverse -QUESTION:

We can decide this controversy only.

11

We decide a live case or controversy.

And your

controversy is over once you prevail on the point that

3

there was at the time this action was taken, that the suit

4

was brought, no imminent danger of any kind.

5

7

MR. ZAIMES:

That would resolve this case fully.

And the reason -QUESTION:

Or alternatively, we could attack it

8

from the other direction and could determine that there's

9

no cause of action for money damages.~

20

MR. ZAIMES:

21

QUESTION:

22

That is true.
And, therefore, it doesn't matter

whether or not this thing was prior or not.

MR. ZAIMES:

QUESTION:

The second way is -- the second point

is the one on which there is the conflict.
MR. ZAIMES:

The second point is the one on

which there is the clear conflict, yes.
Now, in addition, I will say that this case has

6

engendered a considerable amount of activity just since

7

the Ninth Circuit came down.

8

outside the record, but as a matter of policy, if the

9

Court wanted to resolve the issue of the -- of what RCRA

This is -- and I am speaking

10

entitles a person to do, it could reach both issues for

11

the reason that if it only resolves imminent and

12

substantial endangerment, then the likelihood of there

13

being recurring issues on what type of relief is available

14

is going to be great.

15
16

17

But the fundamental reason is there is a
conflict in the circuit but, Justice Scalia -QUESTION:

What if we had a case where there is

18

an imminent and substantial endangerment alleged and the

19

plaintiff says, I want an injunction and I want an order

20

that the defendant will pay the costs of future cleanup?

21

Is that within the court's equitable power?

22

MR. ZAIMES:

This is before -- this is an order

23

that the defendant would clean it up now or the order

24

would say, plaintiff, you may clean it up and we are going

25

to order defendant to pay that?

QUESTION:

MR. ZAIMES:

3

In the first instance, if the order were simply

Either way?

is entitled to issue that sort of order because what the

such person to take such other action.

contemplated by that is that the defendant is going to

And that's the fundamental basis of our

QUESTION:

13

What if the court makes exactly such

an order and says, defendant, stop what you're doing now,

16

defendant can't get its hands on the money to pay for it

17

or is just contumacious and whatnot.

And the defendant doesn't either because the

1

you're arguing.

2

MR. ZAIMES:

3

QUESTION:

Absolutely correct, Justice Scalia.
Then to go to the correct principle,

4

how could you in fact interpret this statute to say that a

5

plaintiff could never get monetary damages?
Suppose the gasoline station next to you is in

6

7

fact right now leaking gasoline through your wall killing

8

your chickens or whatever, and what you do is you have to

9

put up a barrier to stop it.

And at the same time, you

10

run into court and you say enjoin it.

11

enjoin it.

12

barrier to keep my chickens safe, and I'd like to be

13

reimbursed for that.

14

So, the court says,

You say I've spent $50,000 on the gasoline

Are you saying that that wouldn't be necessary

15

to give you the little extra money that you needed in

16

order to take immediate action within a few hours in order

17

to stop all your livestock from dying or whatever?

18

mean, normally in equity I think that kind of restitution

19

would be normal.

I

*

20

So, what's the argument on the merits that this

21

statute wouldn't give you that, even though that's not in

22

this case at all, a totally hypothetical?

23

MR. ZAIMES:

With all those assumptions, the

24

argument is that that is the way this statute is

25

structured.

1

QUESTION:

The word in the statute is

2

"necessary," and how would you say that that kind of

3

normal equitable relief, which is the principle you want

4

to argue for, never could be necessary?

5

MR. ZAIMES:

Well, with all due respect, Justice

6

Breyer, the wording of the statute is "order such person

7

to take such other action as may be necessary" --

8

9

QUESTION:

And it may be -- why isn't it

necessary in the circumstance, given the history of

10

equity, et cetera, to make at least the monetary

11

restitution necessary to clear up the absolute immediate

12

emergency action that the plaintiff took in order to save

13

the lives of his livestock?

14

MR. ZAIMES:

Fundamentally because our argument

15

is that that is not what Congress intended.

16

intended to --

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ZAIMES:

Congress

Why not?
Why?

Because in the broader scheme

19

of things, the citizen suit remedy in' this statute, as in

20

its predecessors, is designed to afford limited relief to

21

plaintiffs and not to have plaintiffs coming in with all

22

sorts of money damages claims --

23

QUESTION:

I agree with that.

That's why I say

24

-- you were arguing for the proposition never, and that's

25

what's bothering me.

Never.

QUESTION:

Mr. Zaimes, your second -- I mean, we

4

may be unfair to you in severing the two points as though

5

they don't overlap.

6

argument with regard to the damages point hinges upon your

assertion that this is a statute that is only intended to

8

prevent future harm.

9

past harm.

As I understand it, part of your

It is not intended to remedy for

10

MR. ZAIMES:

11

QUESTION:

That is true.
And in the hypothetical that Justice

12

Breyer just posed to you, what you were doing is

13

reimbursing the plaintiff for that past damage that he's

14

incurred for putting up the barrier.

15

that he would not be able to get that if we take the first

16

point in the case.

17

able to get that.

18

And there's no doubt

There's no doubt that he would not be

Once -- although he's put up the barrier, once

19

all of the oil pollution next door has’heen eliminated, he

20

has no cause of action at all, neither for putting up the

barrier nor for anything else.

22

And part of your argument is that these two

23

halves go together.

25

sense in allowing a court to give damages for something

MR. ZAIMES:

That is part of the argument and

3

that is what the statute provides, and that's

7

Number one, we as parties litigating and the

10

90-day notice provision and then by implication in some

2

So, presumably in a situation where you have hazardous

going in to remedy a hazardous waste situation.

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS

14
15

MR. MINEAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

16

The initial and controlling issue in this case

17

is whether a citizen plaintiff may seek relief under

18

section 7002(a)(1)(B) of RCRA if there is no current

19

endangerment at the time of suit.

20

clearly no.

We* think the answer is

Section 7002(a)(1)(B) provides that for judicial

21

22

relief in response to specific activities, namely, the

23

treatment, storage, and disposal of waste, that, quote,

24

may present an imminent and substantial endangerment, end

The statute's use of the term "may present"

1

2

indicates there must be a current endangerment at the time

3

the suit is filed.

4

section 7002(b)(2)(A), the so-called notice provision,

5

which requires the plaintiff to provide notice to the

6

defendant and also to the other government agencies of the

7

endangerment before filing suit.
Respondent attempts to avoid that construction

8

9

That construction is born out by

by arguing that the limiting clause requiring endangerment

10

actually refers to a description of the hazardous waste

11

and not to the antecedent activities.

12

however, will not afford that construction.

13

The statute,

Section 7002(b)(2)(B), which appears at the

14

bottom of appendix page 3 of respondent's red brief,

15

states that a citizen suit is precluded if the EPA is

16

taking action in response to, quote, activities that may

17

present the alleged endangerment.

18

clear that Congress was referring to the activities and

not the waste when using the term "endangerment."

QUESTION:

2

MR. MINEAR:

Thank you.
This -- the construction that we

3

urge here is not only consistent with the statutory terms,

4

but it is also consistent with the overall design of the

5

statute which is structured to abate existing hazards.
For example, the statute makes reference to

6

7

prospective remedies.

8

provision, as I discussed before, which provides for the

9

elimination of the hazard and the avoidance of the suit.

It also provides a notice

10

It also contains no statute of limitations respecting any

11

damage claims that would thereby prevent any stale damage

12

claims.

13

In addition, the legislative history supports

14

the construction that we urge.

15

198 describes the section 7002(a)(1)(B) remedy as a

16

limited abatement remedy.

17

For example, House Report

If you agree with us that the -- a citizen must

show a imminent and substantial endangerment at the time

19

of suit, then the Court need go no further in this case.

the court of appeals decision should be reversed on that

basis alone.

MR. MINEAR:

8

9
10

Well, I think there are two answers

to that.
First, I think it's important for this Court to

11

recognize that the preconditions for suit must be

12

satisfied before we get to the issues of remedy.

13

obviously, they are related, but I think it is -- it puts

14

the Court in a difficult position to address the question

15

of remedies where no such remedy could be afforded in this

particular case.

Now,

Second, if you do resolve the case on the first

issue, I think that might well cause the court of appeals

19

to reconsider its reasoning with regard- to the second

currently exists will dissipate as a result of your ruling

It's our view that all of them may

Congress is presumed to have known about at the time that

it enacted the statute.
The language of the statute in Porter and the

2

jurisdiction and authorization for any person, citizen, to

commence an action on his own behalf against all of the

named defendants under the conditions stated in the

statute.

6

this is where the Eighth Circuit was wrong.

So, we don't have to deal with Cort v. Ash, and

Now, we say that under the words of the statute,

injunction ordering in fact the cleanup of the property by

MR. ROMANO:

1

We believe that Congress --

Congress could have put the imminent hazard/endangerment

4

that the broadest possible remedies will be available to

deal with conditions of imminent and hazard endangerments.

It did not.

to imminent and hazardous conditions may arise not only

11

from hazardous substances, but also from solid waste and

QUESTION:

So, you say then he doesn't have to

7

MR. ROMANO:

We don't believe that the condition

8

of imminent and substantial endangerment has to be present

9

at the time of the filing of the lawsuit.

10

Now, we believe

that the statute supports us on this issue.
When Congress wanted to put a limitation on the

11
12

timing of the filing of the lawsuit in this statute, it

13

imposed them in section B of the statute.

14

no action may be commenced until several things have

happened.

within a period of 90 days the EPA or the State does not

bring the lawsuit.

12

MR. ROMANO:

MR. ROMANO:

It

If I understand Your Honor's

8

question, it deals with violation of standards or permit

9

1

Your Honor, we believe that when

Congress wanted to put limitations on when such lawsuits

3

should be filed, it put them under the actions prohibited

That language is not found over there.
What the petitioners are arguing is take some

MR. ROMANO:

You can bring an action under the

MR. ROMANO:

That's a good answer.
And -- thank you.

It may not win your case.

Well, the Government makes -- the

10

Government's position is an interesting position because

11

--we don't agree with that, obviously, and the reason for

12

that is, is that the Government says, okay, if you find

13

contamination, what you do is you have to start providing

14

notices to people, assuming you can locate all of those

15

people, before you do any cleanup activities.

16

only after you provided notice to all of the defendants

17

can you then follow with the filing of a lawsuit.

18

Only you --

We believe that such a reading of the statute

19

will really contravene the congressional purpose in

20

enacting the statute which is if you have a condition

21

which is by definition the worst type of environmental

22

contamination, what you would want to do is clean it up

23

and then work out the details as to who is responsible.

govern the statute provide all of the necessary

the lawsuit.
So, we believe that it is entirely appropriate

for the Court to hold that a plaintiff may, in the limited

circumstances where the contamination presents an imminent

14

and substantial endangerment to health and the

15

environment, do whatever is necessary to abate those

conditions, and then sue under this statute to recover his

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ZAIMES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. ZAIMES:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I'll

cover only three points in that 2-minute time, if I may.
First, I had begun to discuss the cases, the

v. Warner Holding and ending up more recently in Franklin

v. Wynnette County.

proposition that there was a broad equitable power in

5

Federal courts that can be called on in this situation.

Those cases are cited for the

6

And if we look at Porter as the beginning of

7

that line, Porter was a case in which the words of the

8

statute were much different from those here.

9

statute that allowed the court to issue an injunction or

10

Porter had a

other order, significantly broader than what we have here.
And the court in that case looked at the

11
12

legislative history and determined that the legislative

13

history of that statute, the Emergency Price Control Act,

14

was consistent with a reading that allowed the court, the

15

lower court, to order the apartment owner to reimburse

16

monies collected over the limit set by the Emergency Price

17

Act.

18

In the Franklin case, there was no congressional

19

guidance on the limitations of remedies under that

20

statute.

21

action had been found to be an implied right of action

22

under Cannon v. City -- University of Chicago.

23

the court determined was that there were four remedies

24

available where Congress has not spoken as to the nature

25

of the remedies.

Franklin arose under title 9 and the right of

remedies either.

3

Here we have an abundance of guidance.

We have

4

the language of the statute.

We have legislative history

5

of this and predecessor statutes and even of the CERCLA

6

amendments in 1986, all of which point to a very limited

7

reading -- limited availability of remedies under this

citizen supervision.

RCRA, which, as Justice Ginsburg notes, has a full

And we have a comparable statute,

10

discussion of the kinds of limitations that are placed on

11

plaintiffs seeking to recover their costs.

12

The second point I want to make with respect to

13

the contumacious plaintiff example, we must remember that

14

State law covers those contumacious plaintiffs in

15

abundance, as does CERCLA in all but petroleum

16

contamination cases.
