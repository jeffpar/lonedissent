CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in Case 07-1114, Cone v. Bell.
Mr. Goldstein.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

9

Justice, and may it please the Court:

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief

As this case comes to the Court, two things

11

I think are uncontested.

12

trial, the prosecution suppressed all of the evidence in

13

its files that went to the single most important

14

contested issue of the case, and that's whether the

15

defendant was a drug addict and committed the crimes in

16

an amphetamine psychosis.

17

The first is that at this

And the second is that as soon as the

18

Petitioner found out about the suppression, he presented

19

his Brady claim to the State courts.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In this There is also a

21

third thing that's uncontested, which is there is no

22

Brady claim on the merits.

23

in your question presented.

24

court of appeals concluded that there was no Brady

25

violation on the merits.

That's not at all included
The district court and the

I don't know what would happen

if we sent this case back.

2

again.

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

They would conclude it

Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

4

there are a couple issues that you've raised.

5

first address the question of whether it's encompassed

6

within the question presented on the merits, because the

7

question is, well, is this all just an academic exercise

8

because the procedural default holding wouldn't change

9

the ultimate outcome in the case?

10

Can I

The answer is that it is, we think, fairly

11

encompassed within the question presented, and I can

12

explain why, including with respect to the text of the

13

question presented.

14

The court of appeals in this case disavowed

15

deciding the merits of the Brady claim.

16

you to the petition appendix, and that is at page 22a

17

and again at 24a.

18

through what the court of appeals said at the very top

19

of 22a:

20

that Cone's Brady claims are procedurally defaulted and

21

not before this court."

22

And let me take

So I'm just trying to walk you

"We, therefore, will not disturb our decision

And then on 24a, at the bottom of the first

23

full paragraph, the last sentence:

24

Cone's claims are procedurally defaulted and we reject

25

Cone's request to reconsider his Brady claims."

by these interesting questions of federalism, however,

5

because in all events the documents discussed in the

6

On page 25a, they've been talking about those

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

"We need not be delayed

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

9

was not going to stop, and I was going to just point out

10

the dilemma that I faced when I wrote the cert petition.

11

So, on the one hand, they disavowed deciding

12

it, and then quite clearly there are some -- there are a

13

couple paragraphs there, you've start -- you've stated

14

one, the next paragraph says the same thing -- talking

15

about the merits of the Brady claim.

16

dilemma that I faced in writing the cert petition.

17

say they're not deciding the Brady claim, but then they

18

talk quite clearly about it.

19

So here's the
They

So I expressed -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but don't -

20

you've resolved your dilemma by not raising anything at

21

all about the merits in the question presented?

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I

23

disagree, and let me explain why.

If you go to the cert

24

petition, of course, which you have in front of you,

25

starting on page 26 5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, let's start on

2

page Roman xi, where the questions presented are.

3

There's nothing in there about the merits of the Brady

4

claim.

5

you have.

It's all about the procedural objections that

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and I -

7

the document, of course -- let's -- let's talk about the

8

text of the question presented, and then I'll give my

9

explanation.

So, the question presented it says is

10

"Whether Petitioner is entitled to Federal habeas review

11

of his claim that the State suppressed material evidence

12

in violation of Brady v. Maryland?"

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We thought I -- I guess what I

14

would say is you've got - habeas review of that claim

15

because the district court decided it on the merits and

16

the court of appeals decided it on the merits.

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

18

have explained why it is, and if I can then take you to

19

the rest of the body of the cert petition.

20

that I'm going to rely on is the question -- the issue

21

is, is it fairly encompassed within the question

22

presented?

23

the one I faced.

24

deciding the Brady claim, then it talked about it.

25

The doctrine

determining what's fairly encompassed, there are two

claim.

The one

Then starting on page 26, we

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

It seems to

me you either did not raise the question or you did.

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

10

Yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you did not, then

11

we don't address the procedural issues that you raised.

12

If you did, then also we have to resolve the question on

13

the merits, a very fact-specific Brady claim that we

14

would not normally take without reaching those

15

procedural issues.

16

issues are before us.

17

So, I don't see why the procedural

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, can

18

I -- can I answer the -- finish answering my question

19

about the body of the cert petition and then come to

20

this?

21

a couple of important points to make on your very

22

understandable question about what's fairly encompassed

23

within the question presented.

24
25

I'm glad to do it in whichever order.

I do have

The particular place that I want to point
the Court to, so starting on 26, we lay out our argument

about the merits, and then footnote 6 explains quite

clearly to the Court -- the Court sometimes has a

"Because the panel disavowed deciding the

13

merits of Petitioner's Brady claim in the language that

14

I quoted you to, and discussed the question only in

16

would not be permissible to state that issue as a

17

distinct question presented."

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

neither one is dicta.

about the merits of the claim, and our reply brief on

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So there's no

Justice Scalia, your

10

frustration about how long in this case is perfectly

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, I took Justice

Kennedy's question to be that this has been in the case

21

all along and hasn't been finally resolved, there isn't

22

a final judgment.

23

Justice pointed out, there is language in the court of

24

appeals' very first opinion in the case.

25

unfortunately only one sentence, but to be fair there is

You're quite right that, as the Chief

11
Alderson Reporting Company

There is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a sentence in the first opinion saying that it's not -

2

that Brady evidence is not material.

3

But I -- I did want to come back to why this

4

has been in the courts for so long.

When he presented

5

it immediately, Justice Kennedy, to the State courts,

6

the State told the State courts that it had been

7

previously determined.

8

It just wasn't true.

9

go off the rails, because we have been trying ever since

It -- it no longer defends that.
And that caused the whole thing to

10

the day that we got access to the materials to get one

11

full adjudication of the claim.

12
13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess it's -- my

questions and the questions and the points -

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- that was raised

16

about the time are related, because one reason these

17

things drag on interminably is that you are -- exactly

18

why you're raising this issue here, it's a procedural

19

nicety or a procedural difficulty that arose some time

20

ago in the State courts.

21

courts, both the district court and the court of appeals

22

have addressed it, and -- and that that's a good

23

jurisprudential approach to say, particularly in a

24

complicated case like this that is 26 years old, here's

25

our answer on this, but so that we don't have to go

But since then the Federal

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

through this again, if we're reversed on that, here's

2

our -- our alternative holding; and they said right

3

after the sentence I quoted, we said this before, and we

4

now say it again:

5

This is not Brady material.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Right.

So, Mr. Chief

6

Justice, it seems to me, though you and I might disagree

7

on what's fairly encompassed, we might have one piece of

8

common ground, and that is it's time to bring this all

9

to a close; that there really isn't a big benefit to

10

having Cone 4 and 5, and that's actually what we have

11

asked the Court to do.

12

Now we are not -

JUSTICE ALITO:

I thought what you asked us

13

to do was to reverse on the procedural default issue and

14

remand the case.

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We -- we do do that.

We

16

also say, however, that if the Court believes that the

17

Sixth Circuit has reached the merits, then this Court

18

should address what are the undefended -- the -- what

19

the Sixth -- the State does not contest are legal errors

20

in its assessment of the merits.

21

The Kyles -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That would -- that

22

would then depend on us agreeing to review a very

23

fact-bound, necessarily fact-bound, Brady question when

24

the questions presented focused on a procedural issue.

25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, first of all, Mr.
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Chief Justice, there -- we have two different sets of

2

errors that we think exist with respect to the Brady

3

claim.

4

encompassed, and I'll come back to it.

5

first point, we do identify what we think are clear

6

legal mistakes by the lower courts in -- whether it's a

7

holding or dictum, not to get into -- enter into that

8

debate, we explain that the Sixth Circuit avowedly split

9

the evidence into sort of four different silos or

I'm not avoiding the question of whether it's
But to your

10

categories, and we think inconsistently with Kyles v

11

Whitley, and we think the lower courts were wrong not to

12

hold an evidentiary hearing.

13

Now, those aren't fact-bound points; those

14

are questions of law, so we believe that it would be

15

perfectly appropriate for this Court to decide the

16

procedural question.

17

Sixth Circuit is not defended here, the idea that

18

previous determination amounts to a procedural default.

19

And then on the question of the merits, the Court could

20

decide those two limited legal questions and leave it to

21

the lower courts to decide the more fact-bound

22

questions.

23

The procedural holding of the

But we do think that the Court -- it is

24

actually quite sensible for this Court to not justify

25

the procedural question, given that it's a very weak 14

you some comfort there.

both sides of this thing.

is that the Petitioner right away presented what is a

very serious Brady claim to the State courts.

one shot.

State courts evaluate the merits of that Brady claim,

11

and then you find out other material later, and the

12

question becomes, how much deference you owe to the

13

State courts the first go-around.

14

This is a very different case.

The -- all

15

of this evidence in the file appeared at one time.

16

There weren't -- it wasn't split, and the only time a

17

Brady claim was disposed of was at the time this Brady

18

claim was disposed of.

19

mentioned became available to the Petitioner, right then

20

and there, he added -- there was paragraph 35 and

21

paragraph 41 of his post-conviction application that

22

were added within a couple months of each other.

23

State court right away, at the urging of the State,

24

said, oh, that's been previously determined, and I won't

25

consider the merits.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But your proposal would

5

be that they would never do it because you want to send

6

it back to the Federal district court, and it's -- and

7

if the State was laboring under misapprehension, it

8

thought that, because he brought up the issue twice, he

had somehow been defaulted, everyone can agree that that

10

didn't make sense.

11

But now you're proposing that the State

court will not be the one to look at these materials;

13

instead it will be the Federal court.

something that Judge Merritt said in his dissent that

indicated he thought that the State court ought to be

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

And we did present the

we don't have the power, it was disavowing it.

13

-- Mr. Chief Justice, even assuming that the court of

14

appeals had a whole section in its opinion saying, we're

15

deciding the merits of the Brady claim, my constraint

16

was, in framing the question presented, as I explained

in that footnote in the cert petition -- and I would

Indeed, the Brady issue, as

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

concern is not that you didn't brief the Brady claim; it

is that -- whatever the non-pejorative synonym for

9

purportedly presented a procedural objection and a

10

I was turning to the question of whether we

have a serious Brady claim and so the Court should have

20

some concerns here, and I really do think that we do and

21

that the passing observations about the lower courts

22

don't fulfill the duty to assess the merits of the Brady

23

claim fairly.

24

the whole reason that there was effectively a trial, was

the question of whether the defendant committed these

here about the evidence, not just that he was a drug

these killings, and there's a -- the first one, there's

a statement about the robbery right before the murders

confirming that the Petitioner -- he was asked, Did he

appear to be drunk or high?

he did because "he acted real weird."

The next one is that the day of the -- at

the jewelry store robbery that immediately preceded the

13

killings, that the Petitioner looked wild-eyed, and then

14

soon thereafter a police officer reports in Florida that

he looks "agitated" and "looking about in a frenzied

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you know, I'll give

you the first, that he appeared drunk or high.

19

pretty clear, but I think you tend to look wild-eyed

20

after you're running out after a jewelry store robbery,

21

and I think you're -- you're certainly inclined to look

22

"agitated" and "looking about in a frenzied manner" when

you've just committed two brutal murders.

evidence about drug addiction, could have also found

evaluate all of those and evaluate the prejudice against

25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Two points, Justice Alito.
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The first is that we say at the very least the Court

2

should make the Kyles point and the evidentiary hearing

3

point.

4

given your point about this is so complicated, there is

5

a lot of evidence here, one ought to compare that in

6

fairness to what the Sixth Circuit did, and the one

7

footnote that the Chief Justice has talked about with

8

the district court and whether they really did take a

9

hard look at the claim.

And the second is, I think to be fair to us,

I think it would be fair to us

10

to say, look, there are some legal errors here that this

11

Court can correct, and then the district court would be

12

the proper place, if it decides to have an evidentiary

13

hearing, to resolve the remainder of the claim.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me ask just one quick

15

question:

16

deliberately suppressed or negligently suppressed?

17

Is it your view that the evidence was

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Deliberately suppressed,

18

although it doesn't matter under Brady.

There was -

19

they turned over almost nothing, and this was the heart

20

of our case.

21

acts had been committed, and our defense was one of

22

insanity, and it was our only argument in mitigation of

23

the death penalty.

They knew that we were conceding that the

24

If I could -

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You recognize that a -- a

27
Alderson Reporting Company

1

defense like this, that the defendant was high on drugs,

2

that isn't ambivalent?

3

might react adversely to the defendant if he says I was

4

drunk on alcohol, that they might say this is a person

5

who put himself in this condition where his will could

6

be overpowered, this is a voluntary act, why should we

7

consider it, why should we consider it mitigating, we -

8

we could just as well consider it aggravating?

9

I mean, a jury, just like it

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It -- it could, and that's

10

why I think it's very important that our defense was

11

amphetamine psychosis brought on by post traumatic

12

stress disorder from honorable service in Vietnam, not

13

just that he was a target.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER L. SMITH
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As the Court has alluded in a number of

22

questions, both the district court and the Sixth Circuit

23

now twice have resolved -- have rejected Cone's Brady

24

claim on the merits, and we believe correctly so in

25

light of Cone's actions in the day surrounding the
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

murder, his statements about what he did and why he did

2

it, and more importantly the lower court's recognition

3

that additional evidence -

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask -- let me get

5

something on the table.

6

shows that this evidence was deliberately suppressed?

7
8
9

MS. SMITH:

Do you agree that the evidence

Your Honor, I don't think

there's been any -- any finding about the JUSTICE STEVENS:

But is there any

10

explanation for -- was there any explanation for it

11

other than the tactical explanation?

12

MS. SMITH:

There's no explanation in the

13

record, there has been no finding about whether the

14

evidence has been suppressed at all in this case because

15

both the district court and the Sixth Circuit decided as

16

a matter of law that the materials -

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It seems to be relevant

18

because if it was suppressed for tactical reasons, it

19

seems to me hard to say that the prosecution thought it

20

didn't make any difference.

21

MS. SMITH:

Well, again, there has -

22

there's been no finding on that, because each court, and

23

I think more than just in a passing statement, each

24

court that looked at it, both the district court and the

25

Sixth Circuit, have looked point by point, especially in
29
Alderson Reporting Company

the district court -

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What they -- one of the

3

first questions always troubles me in a Brady case is

4

the conduct of the prosecutor and the ethics of the

5

profession, the whole -- whole importance of the rule is

6

to be sure prosecutors perform their public function.

7

And I'm just wondering if there is any -- if this was a

8

case of just an honest mistake, it would be one thing,

9

but if it appears to have been a tactical decision and a

10

tactical program, it seems to me very difficult to

11

assume that the prosecutor thought it was really not

12

important evidence.

13

MS. SMITH:

Your Honor, I certainly

14

understand the Court's concern, and I'll just -- and

15

again reiterate, there has not been any finding on that,

16

but there is at least a suggestion in the record that

17

some of the evidence on which the Petitioner is relying

18

at this point actually wasn't suppressed.

19

this in our brief, specifically as to the witness Ilene

20

Blankman.

21

And we noted

All of the individual items on which the

22

Petitioner is traveling now were the subject of

23

cross-examination, so that at least raises the question

24

about whether -

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Blankman, that isn't the

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

concern.

The concern is simply this:

2

correct, that this whole trial revolves around whether

3

this individual is suffering post traumatic stress

4

disorder with these amphetamines.

5

If they're

They have two expert witnesses who say that

6

he's in very bad shape, everything the defense wanted

them to say; that's it.

9

That's their evidence.

On cross, the prosecutor gets both of them
to admit that they're basing their testimony on what the

10

defendant told them about his drug use.

At which point

11

the prosecutor says, let's talk to Mr. Roby, who is the

12

arresting officer, did you see he was on -- when you

arrested him, was he on -- did he look like he was on

There's your case.

22

Now, in fact in the files is evidence that

23

Mr. Roby, that very day of the crime and the next day,

24

sent out all-points bulletins saying he was a dangerous

25

drug user.

There is evidence in the files that Mr. 31
Alderson Reporting Company

that the FBI man sent out similar all-point bulletins.

2

There are three witnesses who have described the

3

behavior of the day as frenzied, and we have heard the

4

descriptions.

5

And you're saying that the lawyer, the

6

trained lawyer for the government, who knew this

7

information and knew the defense just what?

8

overlooked it by accident?

9

MS. SMITH:

Just

Just what?

Well, Your Honor, I can't speak

10

for the prosecutor's state of mind at the time, but I

11

will -- will state that the central question in the case

12

was not whether the Petitioner used drugs.

versus a drug seller was not the only argument the State

to turn this material over?

I'm unaware of any ethical

13

requirement that he turn it over, and I don't think

we don't think it was material, then it's certainly not

not -

matters that -

11

MS. SMITH:

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.

And -

-- have some relevance.
Wouldn't -- wouldn't he err

13

on the side of turning over the matters because Brady

14

leaves the materiality judgment, like all materiality

15

judgments, ultimately, to the fact finder?

16

to the fact finder, but the prosecutor is JUSTICE KENNEDY:

leaves the judgment for, furthering Justice Souter's

point, to the attorney for the defense.

21

that the prosecutor can preempt the role of the attorney

MS. SMITH:

Correct me if that's

4

the defense ultimately would make the decision how to

5

use the evidence that comes into his possession.

obviously, the prosecutor has to make an initial

judgment call about whether or not the evidence is going

8

to be material, given what he knows about -- about the

9

defense.

10

obligation to make an initial assessment as to whether

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Maybe I'm being -- but

6

Justice Breyer made the point, and made it, I think very

7

clearly, that although that evidence was in, the

8

argument here -- the argument that was made before the

9

jury in this case is that the witnesses upon whom the

10

defense was specifically relying, were witnesses whose

11

account of the defendant's drug use came solely from the

12

defendant himself.

13

Given that fact, wouldn't it have been

14

mitigating evidence to learn that other people, at times

15

relatively close to the events in question, without

16

being coached by the defendant, had concluded that he

17

was a drug user?

believe you have just made a statement to me that is

utterly irrational.

12

MS. SMITH:

Well, let me explain if I -- if

13

I may, and the reason I say that it is not mitigating is

14

because the -- the entire question in the defense and

15

for mitigation purposes is the defendant's state of mind

at the time of the murder.

prosecutor who said "baloney."

2

-- the prosecutor says:

3

a drug user.

He said the prosecutor

The defendant tells you he was

Baloney, he was a drug dealer.

4

The prosecutor deliberately tried to paint

5

this man as somebody who had a huge quantity of drugs,

6

which he did, and he was dealing in them.

7

the prosecutor tried to portray a man who was a cold

8

blooded killer, who didn't have any blurred vision.

9

I mean the -

And that line to the jury, "baloney" -- he

10

says he was a drug user -- that, it seems to me, is

11

exactly what the prosecutor wanted to do, which is to

12

tell this jury this guy's a dealer; he's not a drug

abuser.

MS. SMITH:

I think that the prosecutor

overstated in that portion of his argument, Your Honor.

JUSTICE BREYER:

You also had cross-examined

the two expert witnesses in order to show that they

didn't really know that this man was a drug user,

1

Souter, how you can say that this wouldn't at least be

2

useful information if -- even for cross-examination, and

3

I think more than that since you have three direct

4

witnesses.

5

But leaving that aside, there's another part

6

of this case that equally bothers me.

It seems to me

7

there was a lawyer for the State here that twice told

8

the courts that this matter had never been raised.

9

that so?

Is

Or maybe he said that the courts had decided

10

it because the State has taken absolutely inconsistent

11

positions, first saying that the trial courts decided

12

it, and they did decide it, but by accident.

13

thought that paragraph 41 referred to this claim when it

14

referred to an earlier claim.

15

They

So first they tell the courts -- and you

16

wouldn't know that unless you are pretty familiar

17

because there were a lot of words written.

18

the courts:

19

They decided it:

20

wake up to the fact that it wasn't decided, and then

21

they announce:

22

there's a case called Swanson in Tennessee that says

23

that you can raise a later claim if you have grounds for

24

not knowing of it in the first place.

Don't worry.

And next they

Oh, he waived it, despite the fact that

40

And he didn't

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So I see the State taking opposite

2

positions, and -- and what seems from the briefs

3

inconsistent with the State law, and I'm confused.

4

is it that happened in this case?

5

MS. SMITH:

What

Well, I -- I want to answer your

6

question, and I will answer your question, Your Honor,

7

if I could just say one thing about the Brady.

8

dispute that the material in question is relevant to the

9

defense and is relevant to the sentence.

We don't

10

We dispute that it's material.

11

think it's material in every court where the district

12

court and the sixth circuit have found it immaterial.

13

But on the -- on the -- the -- what has happened in

14

terms of the procedural defense, we have confessed that

15

there was an error by the State in the -- in the post

16

conviction court.

17

We don't

We agree that Tennessee law does allow -- it

petitioner could establish cause.

parts and subparts, made a mistake and read paragraph 35

23

same.

Now, the prosecutor

That was an error.

JUSTICE ALITO:

In his principal brief he
He never even reaches

If we read the -- can I ask

11

you this:

If we read the decision of the Court of

12

Criminal Appeals as having ratified the -- the district

13

court's -- the -- the lower court's treatment of the

14

procedural default issues, having rejected it on the

15

ground that it was previously decided, that would be an

16

instance in which a State court applied a procedural

17

default rule based on an undisputed error of fact.

18

In that situation, would it not -- wouldn't

19

it be clear that there was not an adequate, independent

20

State ground for the decision; and, therefore, no

21

procedural default?

22

wouldn't the appropriate step be on this very factual

23

Brady issue to send it back to the lower federal courts?

24
25

And if we were to find that,

MS. SMITH:

In answer to your first

question, yes, we don't disagree with the proposition
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that if a trial -- that if a State court refuses to

2

consider a claim on the basis that that claim has been

3

determined previously, that that would not be an

4

adequate basis for a procedural default in Federal

5

Court.

6

But we don't -- I don't think that this case

7

presents that scenario, and every court that has looked

8

at the Court of Criminal Appeals's decision has read

9

that decision as applying a waiver.

The District Court

10

read that decision as applying a waiver.

11

-- at page 112-A of the petition appendix, not only does

12

the District Court read it as a waiver, but the

13

Petitioner read it as a applying a waiver.

14

you note in that first sentence, as to the Brady claim

15

to the district court, Cone also attempts to argue that

16

those claims were improperly held waived by the court.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you look at

Because as

Well, "waiver," my

18

goodness.

First, I don't think it's impossible to say

19

"waiver" since he wrote the words in paragraph 41 that

20

make absolutely clear that they aren't waiving it.

21

is raising it.

He

22

Then, aside from that, the paragraph of the

23

district -- of the court of appeals's opinion says they

24

were already decided or waived.

25

best, for you.

So it's ambiguous, at

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So let's go back and see what the State

2

district court held, and I think that the State district

3

court held that it had been decided, not that it had

4

been waived.

Am I right?

5

MS. SMITH:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MS. SMITH:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

The trial court Yes.

-- held that.
Okay.

So there the cases

in this Court would say if a State appeals court writes

10

a matter -- something -- a sentence that is ambiguous so

11

you don't know whether it was decided:

12

they mean it was waived or mean that it was decided,

13

then the next best thing to do, which makes sense, is

14

look to the lower court to see what they actually did.

15

For example,

So we follow that rule, and we get to

16

exactly what justice Alito said:

17

they were holding that this has already been decided.

18

MS. SMITH:

That what they did was

I think that rule holds if the

19

petitioner has made the argument to the appellate court.

20

Here the Petitioner didn't make the argument to the

21

appellate court.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Don't you think at this

23

point the Petitioner is saying in -- in his briefs:

it's one thing; then they tell me another.

It wasn't until the 2007 opinion that the -

the sixth circuit even discussed this notion of previous

determination, and only then in response to what I think

23

was a red herring injected by the dissenting opinion

24

that somehow the -- the Court of Criminal Appeals's

25

decision stood for something different than what the
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

parties and the courts had been reading it all along.

2

The Court of Criminal Appeals -

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Could the explanation of

4

this language in the opinion be due to the fact that the

5

State first argued that it had already been decided;

6

then in later courts the State changed its theory and

7

announced that it had been waived?

8

MS. SMITH:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10
11

The State Isn't that why they're

writing about waiver?
MS. SMITH:

No, Your Honor.

The State has

12

consistently maintained throughout the habeas that the

13

-- that the Brady claim was either defaulted or waived.

14

In the answer to the petition, the State presented the

15

very argument that they're presenting today, that the

16

Court of Criminal Appeals relied on a waiver.

17

in the brief to the Sixth Circuit -

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In the -

Spell out the waiver in

19

light of what he said.

The first time he learns that

20

these -- cases, other cases cited and he has access to

21

the district attorney's file, he then files a habeas,

22

State habeas petition in which he said that the facts on

23

which his Brady claim rests have been revealed through

24

disclosure of the State's files which occurred after the

25

first conviction proceeding.

Those words are in the

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

affidavit -- right -- that came with the second

2

petition.

3

when he has explained it wasn't available to him?

4

So how could he possibly have waived this

MS. SMITH:

Well, I think to understand how

5

this -- how this could happen, the bottom line is that

6

he failed to demonstrate to the State courts why he

7

should -- he was properly before the court to begin

8

with; and when you -- when you raise a claim -- he

9

buried his claim among a hundred other parts and

10

subparts.

11

certainly didn't highlight it as such, and then he -- he

12

buried even further his explanation for a waiver in a

13

41-page affidavit filed six days before the State

14

court's ruling in this case.

15

If --if he had a legitimate claim, he

It was the first time in the entire case

16

that he mentioned anything at all about access to the

17

prosecutor's files.

18

judgment in the trial court he never even made the

19

argument in the Court of Criminal Appeals.

20

completely different theory about waiver, said that

21

waiver was personal, and should be -- should be judged

22

on a subjective standard rather than objective -- never

23

mentioned to the Court of Criminal Appeals any argument

24

whatsoever about access to the prosecutor's files.

25

Then when he got an adverse

He took a

It was on the basis of that argument that
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Court of Criminal Appeals held that the Petitioner

2

had failed to rebut the presumption of waiver as a

3

matter of law as to all claims that had not been

4

previously determined.

5

So that holding is an overarching holding,

6

it applies to every claim that was raised in the first

7

term and in the successive habeas position, and we think

8

justified the district -- it certainly was the basis of

9

the district court's default and as well, in 2001 was

10

the basis of the Sixth Circuit's decision.

11

Now, regarding the 2007 decision, we concede

12

that that decision could be read as presenting the

13

question 1, where this Court relies on a finding of

14

previous determination, but we don't think that's what

15

the court did in 2007.

16

ruled that it was not revisiting the Brady claim.

17

was a decision based on law of the case principles, and

18

to the extent that it discussed previous determination,

19

we don't think it in any way intended to modify its

20

earlier holding.

In 2007 the court specifically
That

21

In 2001 the Sixth Circuit clearly relied on

22

the waiver bar, and that's very evident on pages 62 and

23

63a in the petition appendix, and that's the basis of

24

the waiver.

25

situation in question 1 is even presented, although

So we don't even think that the -- that the

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

if -- to answer a question, in response to Justice

2

Alito's question, I think it would be -- would be an

3

absurd result that something that has been previously

4

determined is defaulted, but that's not the situation

5

here.

6

The Petitioner has never argued that it's previously

7

determined, and no court until this point has ever even

8

read the Court of Criminal Appeals decision as making a

9

previous determination finding.

10

The record shows it's not previously determined.

Everyone has accepted

the fact that that holding was a waiver holding.

11

So on that -- that's the basis of the

12

default, and the reason that he has defaulted is that he

13

failed to make that argument when he had -- when he the

14

opportunity to make it.

15

didn't make it.

16

on his waiver argument, he was making inconsistent

17

arguments.

18

novel, the claim that my post-conviction counsel didn't

discuss it with me.

presented in the Court of Criminal Appeals bears no

But all of this aside, it really is -- is
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

beside the point because at the end of the day, the

2

district court very clearly addressed -- and

3

specifically, not just in passing, but specifically at

4

various points in its -- in its opinion, the materiality

5

of each and every item of evidence.

6

He went through in detail a discussion of

7

the police teletypes, stating that -- that the jury

8

already was aware that he was a drug user.

wasn't any question whether he was a drug user; the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The question was

What -- what do you say to

14

the argument on the other side, that these various items

15

of -- of Brady material were averted to and were

16

discussed on a purely isolated basis; they were not

17

discussed in terms of their cumulative effect, which

18

Kyles v Whitley says is the standard.

19

response to that?

20

MS. SMITH:

What's your

Well, I think if you look at the

21

-- at the district court's opinion, I could that

22

argument could be made based upon the way the district

23

court treated the items.

24

did look at them in categories and separated them; but I

25

think if you look at the Sixth Circuit's opinion,

The district court certainly

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

certainly in 2007 where the court -- the court looked at

2

it in more detail, I think that it is clear that the

3

court cumulated the items and said as a whole that the

4

Brady materials don't undermine -- do not undermine

5

confidence in the verdict.

6

the Sixth Circuit treated them incorrectly, and -- and I

7

would note -

8
9

So I disagree that -- that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do -- do you agree the

prosecutor was arguing, when he said that he's a drug

10

dealer, that he was not a drug user?

11

conceded that he was a drug user?

12

Was it -- was it

I suspect it was not.

I said earlier it was, and it seems that it

13

was not, because he introduced one witness to say that

14

there were no -- no needle marks on his body, which

15

would suggest that he's trying to make the point to the

16

jury that this person doesn't even use drugs.

17

MS. SMITH:

Your Honor, I -- I think I've

18

noted earlier, I think that the prosecutor overstated

19

his case on that point, no question about it; but I

20

think there was ample evidence in the record indicating

21

that he was a drug user.

22

even noted there was proof of the fact that he was a

23

drug addict, that he was a drug user, that the evidence

24

was strong that he was -- that he was under the

25

influence of an amphetamine psychosis.

This Court even noted that,

51
Alderson Reporting Company

There were two

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

experts that testified to that.

On the other hand,

2

there were two experts for the State that said that that

3

-- that defense couldn't be supported.

4

So the question of whether he was a drug

5

user or not a drug user was really beside the point.

6

think the prosecutor eventually got around to that in

7

his argument.

8

whole, the bottom line of the argument was, and we

9

quoted it in our brief, "look at what he did, look at

I

When you look at the argument of the

10

his actions around this murder, and let that go to his

12

only is that -- he said, he specifically said he went

13

into this individual's home with the purpose of getting

14

fed, getting cleaned up and getting out of town, and

15

20

His actions are very calculated from -- from beginning

21

to end.

22

the question is what was going on at the time of this

23

murder, and by his own admission the reason that the

24

Todds are -- are not with us today is because they

25

ceased to cooperate; they became frightened; and he had

have the State, which is unapologetic about having

15

suppressed a whole bunch of evidence and about having

16

misstated the procedural history to the State court and

17

then to the Sixth Circuit.

18

Court's business is usually not to get into the weeds,

19

things like fact-bound Brady claims, and I think that

20

the Court can accommodate both the concern of the signal

21

that it would send in affirming the judgment in this

22

case and also the -- the bad precedent it might set by

23

getting into the Johnson pitfalls of this witness

24

statement and that witness statement, by resolving the

25

case as follows:

On the Brady claim, it seems to me that the

8

court of appeals, when it did discuss the claim, made a

9

couple of big mistakes the Court could identify and send

10

the case back.

The first is, when it talked about the

11

merits, it said we don't think this evidence would have

12

mattered because there was a lot of evidence at trial

13

that he was a drug user.

14

think in detail, the court of appeals, because its

15

assessment was kind of passing here, misunderstood that

16

when the experts said that, when the prosecutor turned

17

around and completely discredited that.

18

that colors the Sixth Circuit's assessment incorrectly.

But as has been discussed, I

And so I think

19

The second is the Kyles point, and the third

is the possibility that we're entitled to an evidentiary

hearing.

And so I think an opinion of this Court that

ruling and then went to the merits and only made those

three points and then left it to the lower courts to

what the State has done here and not getting into the

weeds of the claim.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is there anything in

7

the court of appeals' treatment of the Brady claim on

8

the merits that suggests it also treated them separately

9

in the different silos, as you put it?

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

We

11

point out that the court of appeals twice said, "We

12

consider the four different categories of Brady evidence

13

separately."

14

very hard to tell, its discussion is so passing here -

15

but it does go through this kind of evidence, say, the

16

FBI files or the police teletypes from Agent Roby, and

17

it says that wouldn't have been persuasive, and then it

18

turns to the witness statements.

19

that its overarching point -

And then when it did discuss them -- it's

But I would also say

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Where do they say

that they're only considering the categories separately?

"We take" -

"We will take up each category of documents separately

and discuss whether they are" -
