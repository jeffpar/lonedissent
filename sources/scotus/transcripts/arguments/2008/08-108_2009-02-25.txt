ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. RUSSELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In common usage to say that somebody

12

knowingly transfers, possesses or uses something is to

13

say that that person knows what it is that he is

14

transferring, possessing or using.

15

knowingly used a pair of scissors of his mother, I am

16

saying not simply that John knew he was using something

17

that turned out to be his mother's scissors or even that

18

John knew he was using scissors which turned out to be

19

his mother's, I am saying that John knew that the

20

scissors he was using belonged out to be his mother.

21

If I say that John

The same principle follows under the Federal

22

aggravated identity theft statute, which calls for a

23

two-year mandatory sentence for anyone who during and in

24

relations certain predicate -

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Doesn't that depend on the

context?

2

exactly the same usage and the person wouldn't

3

necessarily know about the ownership of the thing in

question?

MR. RUSSELL:

7

You can think of examples where you have

I haven't been able to think

And the government hasn't been able to come up

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How about so and so

stole a car that belonged to Mr. Jones.

I suppose you

10

could say that the person knew it was Mr. Jones' car,

11

but more likely somebody stole the car that turned out

12

to be Mr. Jones's.

13

MR. RUSSELL:

I think that that formulation

14

gives rise to a little bit more ambiguity in that

15

context.

16

Jones, it is not particularly ambiguous.

17

very least, this is a formulation that claim.

18

I think if you said stole the car of Mr.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But at the

You think he knowingly

19

stole the car that belonged to Mr. Jones, would that be

20

MR. RUSSELL:

Yes, I'm sorry if I left that

part out.
JUSTICE SCALIA:
"knowingly."

You left out the

Once you put in "knowingly" -

MR. RUSSELL:

I think if the statement is,
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you know, John knowingly stole the car of Mr. Jones,

2

that strongly implies that John knew that the car

3

belonged to Mr. Jones.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

I repeat, doesn't that

5

depend on the context that you say somebody says to you,

6

you know, a car was stolen from our street last night.

7

Oh, what car was stolen?

8

Jones.

9

doesn't necessarily mean that the person who stole the

11

Oh, it was the car of Mr.

He knowingly stole the car of Mr. Jones.

It

car knew that it was Mr. Jones's car.
MR. RUSSELL:

I do think that the

12

formulation that John knowingly stole the car of Mr.

13

Jones most naturally is understood to imply that John

14

knew whose car it was he was stealing.

15

We don't claim that the government has an

16

interpretation that's grammatically impossible.

17

just simply saying that by far the most common usage of

18

this kind of formulation, particularly in a criminal

19

statute, is that the knowledge element applies to the -

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

We are

Who did the mugger mug?

He

21

mugged the man from Denver.

You think that he knowingly

22

mugged the man from Denver.

Do you think that means

23

that the mugger knew that the man was from Denver?

24
25

MR. RUSSELL:

I think that is a more

ambiguous statement.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

MR. RUSSELL:

3

Why is it more ambiguous?
Because I think the "from"

preposition -

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

unambiguous.

6

unambiguous.

7

Why isn't it less

I thought your argument was that this was

MR. RUSSELL:

I think the possessive form

8

makes it, through common usage, unambiguous.

9

claim that it is grammatically impossible.

10

We don't
But we do

think that in ordinary usage people would understand -

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what if it isn't?

I

12

mean, suppose you had a statute, and the statute says it

13

is a crime to mug a man from Denver.

14

ordinance, by the way, because no one else would pass

15

it.

16

crime, I guess, we do normally apply knowingly to each

17

of them.

We think that as a matter of

JUSTICE BREYER:

I was thoughtfully trying
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to push you on to the next argument.

2

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, we do think that in a

3

criminal statute you ordinarily assume, this Court has

4

said that a conventional Mens Rea element extends to all

5

of the elements of the offense.

6

And Congress knows how to deviate from that

7

when it wants to.

It did so, for example, in the

8

statute that the Court construed in the X-Citement Video

9

case, where it referred to a person knowingly

10

transporting a visual depiction, comma, if that visual

11

depiction has certain characteristics.

12

recognized that that kind of formulation most naturally

13

is read to end the knowledge requirement as the comma,

14

if.

And this Court

15

Congress didn't do that here.

16

there is no textual indication that would lead one to

17

believe that it didn't intend anything other than a

18

completely conventional Mens Rea requirement in this

19

case.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In fact,

Mr. Russell, am I correct

21

in understanding that the government goes with you

22

almost all the way, and its only the last three words

23

"of another person," that they agree knowingly applies

24

to "without lawful authority," and that it applies to a

25

means of identification?

You have to know that it
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was -- you were using the means of identification.

2

MR. RUSSELL:

As I understand that is not

3

their position.

4

position.

5

the verbs.

6

that then, maybe it goes through "without lawful

7

authority."

8

goes halfway through the phrase "means of identification

9

of another person.

10

That's the back-up to their back-up

The first position is that it only applies to
Then they say, well, if you don't accept

And if you don't accept that, then maybe it

So, they do raise all three alternatives.

11

That last argument, I think, fails both for text common

12

usage reasons and in light of this tradition element

13

that we have been discussing.

14

something no textual cue that the knowledge requirement

15

stops halfway through the direct object phrase, "means

16

of identification of another person."

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Textually, there is

If the first -- this

18

alien's first effort to get papers that would qualify

19

for him, if I -- if I remember correctly, the first time

20

around he used an assumed name, not his own name.

21

MR. RUSSELL:

That's right.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He used a false date of

23

birth.

But the second time around, your case, he

But when the number turned out to be that

is because it turned out that those numbers had been

assigned to somebody else.

21

predicate offenses, and received very substantial

22

punishment for that, but it's not enough to show that he

Under our view, that's not

That's enough to show that he committed the

Would it be enough to go

to the jury on the hypothetical Justice Alito gives you?
MR. RUSSELL:

I think so.

I think the

government is free to present circumstantial evidence.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You agree that you could

21

go to the jury whenever there is an identity card that

22

does reflect the identity of a real person but there is

23

no other knowledge that the government's case is

24

introduced that shows -- that there is no other evidence

25

that the government has introduced showing knowledge?
10
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. RUSSELL:

If there is -- I think that

2

could be a component of circumstantial evidence case.

3

don't think it would be enough.

4

like this where -

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Particularly in a case

Suppose he has five

6

different cards with five different real people, would

7

that be enough to go?

8
9

MR. RUSSELL:

I don't think so in itself.

Particularly in a case like this where the person gets

10

up and testifies that they didn't know.

11

there is these numbers here -

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, no.

The fact that

No. The fact that

13

he testified, that doesn't have anything to do with

14

whether or not the case goes to the jury.

15

government make its case sufficient to resist the

16

motion -- the directed motion for acquittal if it just

17

puts in the fact that you have five identity cards and

18

there are five different people and they are all real

19

people?

20

MR. RUSSELL:

Does the

No, I don't think so.

And in

21

fact, the fact that they are five different people

probably tends to undermine the evidence.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You are making it very hard

24

for me to vote with you, I must say.

I thought you had

25

a pretty good -- a pretty good case.

But if you are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

going to say somebody who has five identity cards, faces

2

of individuals, presumably they are real individuals -

MR. RUSSELL:

I'm sorry, maybe I am

misunderstanding the hypothetical.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought that was the

6

hypothetical.

7

identity cards of real people, and -- and you don't know

8

that he knows that its the identity cards of a real

9

person, but he used it.

10

Five different -- the person has five

MR. RUSSELL:

Okay.

If there -- if these

11

are identity cards that have the picture of somebody

12

other than him on them -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. RUSSELL:

15

Yes.

Yes.

-- which is an unusual

thing -

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. RUSSELL:

Of course.

But if that's the case, then,

18

yes, I think that -- you know, that there would be -

19

that that picture belongs to the person whose number is

20

there, and that they could do that.

21
22
23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, no.

The ordinary You have to have

the further inference that he knows that.
MR. RUSSELL:

I think a jury could

24

reasonably infer that the person wouldn't -- would not,

25

that if you have an ID card with somebody else's name,
12
Alderson Reporting Company

somebody else's number, somebody else's picture, that

2

that belongs to somebody else.

I don't know -- he used his own

Did he use his own photograph?

8
9

In this case he had his own name.

MR. RUSSELL:
that question.

I don't know the answer to

I mean, Social Security cards don't have

pictures.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That was going to be my

12

next question.

13

Petitioner's own name but somebody else's number.

14
15

The next question is suppose it was the

MR. RUSSELL:
that's not sufficient.

I would tend to think that
Of course -

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, that would Even if he had five

18

different cards, all with his name, but all with the

19

identification numbers of other real people?

20

MR. RUSSELL:

Again, I would -- I would

21

think not.

I can understand that people could disagree

22

with that.

And of course, the government is free to

23

raise those kinds of arguments in other cases where this

24

comes up.

25

All of this goes the question of what does
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it take to show that somebody knows something.

The

2

question before the Court right now, and the only

3

question, is whether the government has to show that

4

knowledge at all.

5

government's principal argument, I think their strongest

6

argument is that reducing the mens rea requirements in

7

that way serves the purpose of facilitating prosecutions

8

and therefore protection of the victim, and we don't

9

deny that it had that effect.

And in this case, you know, the

And we don't deny that

10

this statute is directed at protecting victims, but that

11

could be said of an awful lot of criminal statutes.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if the defendant

13

chooses a name -- uses a name other than his or her own

14

name?

15

that, and doesn't know for sure that the name that's

16

chosen actually belongs to another person, but because

17

it's not an extremely uncommon name, has -- knows that

18

it's virtually certain that that name belongs to some

19

other person who is unknown to him?

20

violation?

21

I guess has a identification card made up with

MR. RUSSELL:

Is that a

I think -- again, you have

22

this issue of recklessness versus knowledge.

23

that in fact it belonged to it, if he used John Doe, it

24

turns out there are several hundred John Doe's in this

25

country, and it does raise a difficult question about
14
Alderson Reporting Company

If he knew

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

how this statute ought to apply when you are using

2

something that is so commonly identifying somebody, but

3

it's hard to say that its identifying anybody in

4

particular.

5

The definition of the means of

6

identification in this statute says that it has to be a

7

name or number that is capable of identifying a

8

particular person, so I think you get into questions

9

when you're talking about common names, about how the

10

statute -- whether the statute would be satisfied.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what if it's not an

12

extremely common name, but not an extremely uncommon

13

name?

14

Kevin K. Russell?

15

And what if it's -- what if the defendant chooses
Would that be a violation?

MR. RUSSELL:

You would have to show that he

16

knew that that was a name belonging to a specific

17

person.

18
19

JUSTICE ALITO:

He would have to know that

there is such a person.

20

MR. RUSSELL:

He would have to know that

21

there is such -- he wouldn't have to know me, but he

22

would have to know that there is such a person.

23

again -

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
Suppose he uses John Smith.

But

Does he have to know that?
Does it suffice that -- do

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

we have to show that he knows there is a John Smith in

2

the phone book, someplace in the United States?

3

MR. RUSSELL:

I think so.

I think he would

4

have to know who that John Smith was, but he would have

5

to know there is a John Smith.

6

kind of scenario does raise difficult questions about.

7
8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that -- I mean, that

But I want an answer to

the question.
MR. RUSSELL:

Well, I think the answer is

10

the one that I gave you, which I think is disputable,

11

but it's -- the answer is that he has to know that there

12

is a specific person named John Smith.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it can't be submitted

14

to the jury on the basis that anybody knows that there

15

is a John Smith?

16

MR. RUSSELL:

I think that -

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can -- can it go to the

18

jury without any other evidence other than the fact that

19

-- his possession of the card?

20

MR. RUSSELL:

If it's a sufficiently common

21

name that he ought to know that there is somebody

22

bearing that name, then yes, I would agree it would go

23

to the jury on that.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If the name said Anthony

Kennedy, would that go to the jury?
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

(Laughter.)

2

MR. RUSSELL:

I -- again -- it's hard to

3

draw lines here, but I think the ultimate question is,

4

you know, could a reasonable jury think that somebody

5

using that name has to know there is a specific person

6

with that name, a specific person with that name?

7

quite possibly they could.

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you give me an

example?

10
11

And

MR. RUSSELL:

It go to the jury.

An awful

lot of name examples would.

12

I think simply in this case, though, when

13

you are talking about a number, I don't think -- it's a

14

much harder case to say that simply having a number on

15

the card should -- should lead you to know that that

16

name very likely belongs to somebody else.

17

there are nine -- there are -- there a billion possible

18

combinations for security -- Social Security numbers,

19

and only about 400 million have been issued.

20

back -- I -

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In fact,

But to get

But if you say this goes

22

to the jury, it doesn't leave very much to your

23

knowledge argument.

24

MR. RUSSELL:

Well -

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, I suppose that

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

defense counsel can get up, say the government hasn't

2

shown that he knew this, and then the government says

3

that of course he knows it -- I don't think you have

4

accomplished very much.

5

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, it does.

I think the

6

jury still has to make the finding that he knew it.

7

in a case like this where my client testified that he

8

didn't know it, where the government didn't contest

9

that, didn't argue that there were substantial evidence

10

showing that he did know it, it's going to be

11

outcome-determinative.

12

In that -

that, and I don't know.

These are outfits that

specialize in making false identifications?
MR. RUSSELL:

Again, the record doesn't

21

disclose how sophisticated the operation was.

22

case it could just be a guy who does this; it could be a

23

very sophisticated operation.

24

over the place out there, in the real world.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In this

I think it's kind of all

Do you have any sense

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of -- because there are any people with false

2

identification papers, how many times it turns out to be

3

the number of a live person, and how many times it turns

4

out like it was in the first instance in this case; it

5

is just a number, a made-up number that doesn't belong

6

to anybody?

7

MR. RUSSELL:

I'm afraid I don't have a good

8

sense of that.

But just to be clear, in addition to

9

being able to just say on the face of the fact about the

10

identification that the government can present

11

circumstantial evidence to the jury, in a great number

12

of cases, particularly the kinds that Congress was most

13

concerned about, the way that they -- the defendant

14

obtained the identification and the way that they used

15

it provides powerful circumstantial evidence of

16

knowledge.

17

Somebody who breaks into a computer system

18

or unauthorizedly uses access to a computer system or

goes dumpster diving looking for IDs obviously knows

20

that they are going to end up with an ID that belongs to

21

another person, and if they use the ID to get into a

22

real person's bank account, then it is awfully good

23

information that they were aware that that was an ID

24

that belonged to another person, because there's no

25

sense in trying to break into the bank account of a

1

non-existent person.

And so we don't think that this is

2

a case in which the government faces some kind of

3

insurmountable burden in proving knowledge in a way that

4

is particularly different than -- than other kinds of

5

situations in which the law commonly requires the

6

government to prove what a defendant knew or did not.

7

To get back to the victim-focused nature of

8

this, you know, Congress could -- we don't dispute that

9

Congress could make a policy judgment that it would be

10

good to hold defendants strictly liable when they used

11

an identification that turns out to belong to somebody

12

else.

13

respect to sentencing enhancement provisions of the sort

14

that the government points to with respect to the

15

quantity of selling drugs in a school zone.

16

Congress makes that choice, Congress makes that clear in

17

the decks of the statute, so if you look at the drug

18

quantity of the school zone provisions that are in

19

appendix E and D of the yellow brief appendix, in

20

appendix D you see Congress establishes in subsection A

21

of that provision the "unlawful act," and it says it's

22

unlawful for any person knowingly to manufacture,

23

distribute, et cetera, a controlled substance.

24
25

Sometimes the law does.

Most commonly with

But when

It includes in that provision a knowledge

that the government has to show that they knowingly

manufactured something which turned out to be a

controlled substance.

5

direct object phrase "controlled substance."

Everybody agrees that the

You don't have to go on to

make your provision make any sense, that he knowingly,

11

you know, uses a means of identification.

MR. RUSSELL:

I disagree as matter of common

13

usage.

14

statute read that way, versus a statute that looks like

15

this one, which in subsection (b) lays out the facts

16

that are aggravating, that they are going to find

17

separately, the drug quantity in subsection (b) of 21

18

USC 48

But I think when Congress intends to have a

No, I guess --I

20

guess basically this is what I was trying to say earlier

21

as well.

22

modifier "without lawful authority."

23

MR. RUSSELL:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

You have in your statute in between there, the

Right.
So that means that

it can stop at a lot more number of earlier places then
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

can the statute you were just citing in appendix D.

2

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, to answer that question

3

-- and then I'd like to return to the school zone

4

example -- the fact that Congress put in "without lawful

5

authority" and enclosed it with commas I think simply

6

reflects that Congress understood that, by inserting

7

that phrase between transitive verbs and the direct

8

object, it was interrupting the natural flow of the

9

sentence.

And I don't think it means -- so the first

10

comma may tell the reader to pause, but the second comma

11

I think just as clearly indicates to the reader that the

12

flow of the sentence continues.

13

And so that I don't think you would say a

14

sentence that says, John knowingly used without

15

permission a pair of scissors of his mother's.

16

would still read that to mean that John knew that the

17

scissors he was using belonged to his mother.

18

insertion of the parenthetical I think indicates that

19

Congress knew it could put it at the end and not change

20

the meaning or put it here.

21

You

That the

But when Congress intends to write a statute

22

that -- that holds people strictly liable for

23

aggravating circumstances or writes something like the

24

quantity provisions where, in subsection (b), Congress

25

sets out the punishment that is deserving because of
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that aggravating factor, and it does not include a mens

2

rea requirement in subsection (b).

3

zone provision, Congress likewise has no mens rea

4

requirement with respect to the knowledge of the person

5

being in a school zone.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And in the school

What about the

7

government's argument in this case that Congress was

8

really going after people who have false identification

9

because of its concern to protect the victim, that is

10

the person whose number is misused?

11

is urging that we take a victim-centered approach to the

12

statute.

13

MR. RUSSELL:

So the government

I do think it's a fair point,

14

that this was a statute that was concerned with victims.

15

Lots of criminal statutes are.

16

read it -- Congress doesn't ordinarily enact even

17

victim-focused statutes without mens rea requirements,

18

and courts don't ordinarily narrowly construe them, even

19

though it's true that omitting mens rea requirements or

20

narrowly construing them furthers the purpose of

21

protecting of the victim.

22

more commonly, as the LaFave treatise that we cite to

23

you explains, we don't hold defendants criminally

24

strictly liable for all of the consequences of their

25

crimes.

But we don't ordinarily

In fact, by far more -- far

It gives the example of somebody who breaks
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

into a house intending to rob it and accidentally sets

2

it on fire -- you know, they're engaged in unlawful

3

conduct to start with -- and so they're not fully to

4

blame there, but nonetheless we don't hold them

5

criminally liable for arson because they didn't intend

6

it.

7

Now, Congress could make a choice.

Congress

8

could choose to hold that arsonist strictly liable -- or

9

the robbery suspect strictly liable for the arson, just

10

as Congress could hold defendants like Petitioner

11

strictly liable for the fact that he ends up using an

12

identification that belongs to somebody else.

13

But our point is simply there are reasons

14

why Congress might not do that, including the nominalist

15

kind of penalties that end up being meted out here,

16

where you have people -- two people with identical

17

culpability ending up with substantially different

18

punishments, or people with substantially different

19

culpability ending up with identical punishments.

20

You have the classic aggravated identity

21

thief who breaks into a bank account using a means of

22

identification he knows belongs to somebody else.

23

exactly the same sentence, under the government's view,

24

as somebody like Petitioner who just unknowingly used a

25

number in order to get a job.
24
Alderson Reporting Company

It's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Now, it's not impossible that Congress could

2

make that policy choice, but when it does it tends to

3

write statutes that look very different than this.

4

writes ones that look like -- that are quantity statutes

5

that I just read or the school zone statute.

MR. RUSSELL:

It

Is that a real

I think that's an open

11

question in the circuits.

Some circuits have said that

12

it has to be a means of identification belonging to a

13

living person, but that's -- that's not settled.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

MR. RUSSELL:

What is your view?

My view -- I mean, the statute

16

says "of another person."

17

presume that to mean a live person.

18

guess, it really doesn't matter to the outcome of my

19

case.

20

I think you would ordinarily

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But ultimately, I

a way, because I understand your theory is there are two

basic kinds of crimes.

where you are pretending to be somebody else so you can

2

get advantage of his credit and his assets and his

3

access to computers.

4
5
6

That's a much more serious crime.

Now, if it's a dead person, it seems to me
to be in the former category, rather than in the latter.
MR. RUSSELL:

That's true.

Certainly, using

7

the identification of a dead person doesn't impose the

8

kind of harms on real victims that Congress seemed to be

9

most focused on in this case.

And certainly, our

10

interpretation of the statute we don't think unduly

11

interferes with that protective function, precisely

12

because the government ought to, in a great many cases,

13

very easily show that the way that the person used the

14

means of identification shows that they knew that it

15

belonged to somebody else.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

His conduct would amount

17

to identity -- what did it say -- is there a crime of

18

identity fraud?

19

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, that's what we have been

20

using to refer to the underlying predicate offense here,

21

which is the misuse of the immigration documents.

22

that's -- that applies whenever somebody uses an

23

immigration document -- and there is another statute for

24

Social Security cards -- that doesn't belong to them.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18
19
20

MR. HEYTENS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
It is common ground that there are at least

21

three preconditions to liability under 18 U.S.C. section

22

1028A(a)(1):

23

commit one of the separate predicate felonies that are

24

specifically enumerated in subsection (c).

25

during the commission of that felony, the defendant must

First and foremost, the defendant must

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Second,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

use something that is in fact a means of identification

2

of another person.

3

identification of another person must itself be without

4

lawful authority and must have the effect of

5

facilitating the defendant's commission of the

6

underlying predicate felony.

7

And, third, that use of the means of

The question in this case is whether the

8

government must also show that the defendant was

9

specifically aware that the means of identification that

10

he uses to facilitate his underlying crime was that of

11

another person.

12

And the answer to that question is no.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Heytens, did the

13

prosecutor give the right answer to Judge Friedman in

14

the district court when Judge Friedman asked:

15

take two people and one of them gets false Social

16

Security cards and it happens that the number belongs to

17

no live person, and another person goes to the same

18

outfit, but the card that he gets does belong to a live

19

person -- he doesn't know in either case -- did the

20

prosecutor give the right answer when he said, when it

21

turns out to be a fictitious number, no two-year add-on,

22

but if it turns out to be a real number, two years'

23

mandatory addition?

24

the difference.

25

Where I

The prosecutor says, yes, that's

Was that the right answer?

MR. HEYTENS:

Yes, it was.
28

Alderson Reporting Company

If I could

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

explain, the first -- the reason that the first

2

defendant is not guilty, is that it is an absolute

3

precondition for liability under this statute that the

4

means of identification in question be that of another

5

person.

6

So there are no victimless violations of

7

1028(a)(1), because if we are having this conversation

8

at all, there was a real victim involved in the case.

9

The reason the second individual is -

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

If I could just interrupt

11

you, why does "of another individual" -- why can't that

12

be read to mean "of a person other than the person who

13

is using the identification," whether this other person

14

is real or not?

15

MR. HEYTENS:

Justice Alito, I think the

16

answer to that relates to the definition of "means of

17

identification," which is reproduced in the appendix to

18

our brief.

19

1028(d)(7).

20

means "any name or number that may be used, alone or in

21

conjunction, to identify a specific individual."

22

understand that, especially in conjunction with the

23

words "of another person," to require, at least under

24

1028A(a)(1), that we have to be talking about a real

25

individual.

I believe it's 4a.

That's 18 U.S.C.

The definition of "means of identification"

29
Alderson Reporting Company

And we

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Heytens, this raises

2

the question I was talking to your opponent about.

3

you think that Congress intended there to be a more

4

severe punishment for somebody who really steals another

5

person's -- knowingly steals somebody else's identity so

6

he can cash in on his credit and so forth?

7

me, arguably, that's the important difference.

8
9

MR. HEYTENS:

Do

It seems to

Justice Stevens, I agree that

a person who deliberately sets out to misappropriate the

10

identity of a known individual is almost certainly more

11

culpable than someone who does not do it but

12

inadvertently does so.

13

But I don't think that is controlling in

14

this case for a very important reason, and the very

15

important reason -- again, to go back to what I said at

16

the outset -- is we are not having this conversation

17

unless the defendant has already committed the predicate

18

felony, and he is subject to punishment for that

19

predicate felony.

20

predicate felony subjected Mr. Flores-Figueroa to a term

21

of up to 10 years of imprisonment, above and beyond the

22

two years.

23

For example, in this case, the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yeah, but I think -- I

24

thought that argument cut against you, because what you

25

are saying is everybody is on the hook.
30
Alderson Reporting Company

There's a basic

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

problem here, which iis -- I will call it identity

2

fraud -- and yet you get an extra two years if it just

3

so happens that the number you picked out of the air

4

belonged to somebody else.

5

MR. HEYTENS:

I understand how from the

6

defendant's perspective -- to use the Justice -- the

7

example that Justice Ginsburg used as well, but it may

8

seem from the defendant's perspective that he just so

9

happened to take a real person's number.

But I think

10

the critical fact here is that it not really seemed that

11

way from the perspective of the real individual whose

12

number he ended up using.

13

critically important fact.

14

And I think that's the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I think that's what

15

we normally bring into sentencing.

16

and that we don't impose mandatory.

17

sentences when the person does something, you know,

18

that's wrong and he knows it is wrong.

19

I mean, normally,
We impose mandatory

When harm occurs, and the harm wasn't known

20

or intended, you can take care of it if you are a judge.

21

You increase the sentence.

22

MR. HEYTENS:

That's the problem.
Justice Breyer, my answer to

23

your question and probably only of interest to those

24

members of the court who find legislative history

25

probative, but I think for those who do, the very
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

significant answer to that is that the one thing the

2

legislative history makes very clear is that at least

3

some members of Congress believed that judicially

4

discretionary sentences before this statute were enacted

5

were failing to adequately take into account the harm

6

suffered by real victims.

7

There is very clear legislative briefs to

8

that effect.

9

judge to take into account the impact -

10

The statement of just leaving up to the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- history, do you know

11

what people who are stealing identities of people who

12

have been bilked or -- I think that -

13

MR. HEYTENS:

I certainly agree, Justice

14

Stevens, that there is a portion of the House report

15

that lists nine specific cases in which Congress -- of

16

which some members of Congress -- people obviously

17

report -- made the judgment that people who would engage

18

in the sort of conduct that Congress wants to reach had

19

received short sentences under the previous regime.

20

There are nine specific examples given in the House

21

report.

22

I acknowledge freely that eight of those

23

nine examples very clearly by the description involve

24

individuals who must have known that they were using -

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why not just says

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

"means of identification," then?

2

write a statute that has elements and you put the word

3

"knowingly," and the knowingly is supposed to modify

4

some elements but not others.

5

statutes that do that.

6

I mean, it's odd to

I can't think of other

It's pretty peculiar.

off the last element.

12

that know -- it doesn't go all the way through, because

13

they repeat the knowingly requirement in those statutes.

14

First of all, Congress has

For example -- and it's the appendix to the

15

reply, Appendix G, at page 23A, the appendix to the

16

reply brief, that reproduces 18 U.S.C. 922(q)(2)(A),

17

which is a statute that repeats another one of the

requirements in the text of the statute, which under

Petitioner's argument doesn't make any sense at all.

would just -

have done is they have used "knowingly" at the

23

24

-- I'm not saying there are none, but I would like to

25

know what they are where "knowingly" doesn't modify

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

something there is strict liability for.

MR. HEYTENS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's going to be

jurisdictional -- probably jurisdictional hooks, like -

5

there could be -- there could be some.

6

see -- you tell me.

7

MR. HEYTENS:

But I don't

I will give you two.

There's

8

the statute that is at issue before this Court in

9

Morissette v. United States, and it's the statute that

10

was construed by the D.C. Circuit in an opinion by

11

Justice Ginsburg in United States v. Chin.

12

The statute in Morissette says, "knowingly

13

converts his use anything of value of the United

14

States."

15

had to have knowledge of the facts sufficient to make

16

his conduct a conversion.

17

property has an owner, that it is not abandoned, and he

18

has to known that the owner is not him.

19

In Morissette, this Court held the defendant

He has to know that the

But the lower courts have uniformly held

20

that under that statute the defendant does not need to

21

know that the property in question belonged to the

22

United States.

23

Or take the Chin statute.

The Chin statute

24

says "knowingly and intentionally uses, hires or employs

25

a person under the age of 18 to avoid detection of drug
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

trafficking crime."

2

In Chin the D.C. Circuit said in every other

3

court of appeals who have considered the question has

4

said the defendant does not need to be specifically

5

aware that the individual in question is less than 18

6

years old.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the reason for that is

8

that it is an equally culpable act where you steal

9

something off of a field than Morissette.

I agree the

10

Morissette case supports you, even though they relied on

11

it, which is interesting to me.

distinguishing between two equally culpable acts.

doesn't even make any difference whether he knew the

between "without authority" and "another person," that

the line seems even more obvious when the "without a

24

the real logic of the statute -- the real -- the

operative description is "a means of identification of

That's why, it seems to me, if you look at

the text, you could say, well, of course, the

"knowingly" has got to refer to the everything that

5

follows, both lawful authority and another person.

And that's why, it seems to me, if you are

All that is true, and that

It -- it seems to me

where the ambiguity is precisely -- is that none of us

25

doubts, I don't think, that what Congress is after with
41

this extra two-year mandatory is identity theft.

2

And where the argument lies is between did

Congress do this by punishing people only who intend to

4

engage in identity theft or people who, while not

5

intending to do so, have that effect.

6

MR. HEYTENS:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the issue.

I think that is And I don't thing I can

resolve that one way or the other from anything you have

It is rather hard to say.

So, therefore, suppose

10

I use the Rule of Lenity this way, which I am trying

11

out.

12

I am not buying it.
In the case of mandatory-minimum sentences,

13

there is a particularly strong argument for a Rule of

14

Lenity with bite.

15

minimums, given the human condition, inevitably throw

16

some people into the box who shouldn't be there.

17

this person should be there and we put him outside, the

So the harm by mistakenly throwing a person

outside the box through the Rule of Lenity to the

wrongly throwing him into the box is great.

provide powerful circumstantial evidence that he knows

there was a discreet measure of punishment that was

appropriate to reflect the presence of a real victim.

6

The fact that there is a real victim gets you two years.

You get whatever else you get on your underlying felony,

considerations about your crime, but the fact that there

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You -- you gave earlier

2

the felony murder example of the one who, the gun goes

statute was entirely victim-centered, because a person

culpability, two people who both intentionally attempt

to cause the death of another human being without any

about the three circuits that have gone either way.

10

You see this

First, as a -- as just a threshold matter,

11

this Court has said repeatedly that the fact that courts

12

have disagreed about the proper interpretation of a

13

statute doesn't suffice to trigger the rule of lenity,

14

because this Court almost never takes a case where there

15

is not a circuit split.

circuit split makes the statute ambiguous would mean

17

that the criminal defendant wins every time; and the

Court has not said that.

But -- but also I think where those courts

have fundamentally gone wrong is they have essentially

Justice Breyer, you asked if there were

5

examples of other statutes in which knowledge

6

requirements didn't extend to all the elements, but the

government gave two examples.

8

clearly an example with a jurisdictional element.

9

of the circuit courts that say that the knowledge

12

elements and jurisdictional elements don't extend -

13

don't require mens rea.

14

With respect to the Chin example, I do

15

acknowledge that there -- there is a decision that this

16

Court hasn't reviewed in which the D.C. Circuit says it

17

doesn't extend to the age of the victim.

18

within a category of special cases where courts have

19

treated the victimization of children differently, in

part because it's so difficult and nearly impossible to

group the defendant's knowledge of the age of the

That falls

That kind of practical barrier simply

MR. RUSSELL:

MR. RUSSELL:

That's right.

That's right.

With respect to

8

the victim-focused nature of this, again, it's true that

9

-- that criminal law takes into account both defendant

10

culpability and harm to victims; but the ordinary

11

resolution is to reserve punishment in the criminal

12

system for those who intend the harms that they inflict.

13

There are, of course, exceptions like felony murder.

14

the history of this points out, that kind of treatment

15

tends to be reserved for serious bodily injury or death

16

kinds of harm, and there is no reason to think that

17

Congress thought, although identity theft is serious,

18

that this fell within that kind of category of

19

exceptions.

20

where Congress relies on facts not known to the

21

defendant for sentencing enhancement, but as I've

22

mentioned earlier, it tends to write those statutes in a

23

way that makes clear that those enhancement factors are

separate and apart from the underlying events, and they
