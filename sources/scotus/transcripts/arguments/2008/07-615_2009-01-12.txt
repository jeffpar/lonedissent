ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BEDERMAN

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. BEDERMAN:

11

morning and may it please the Court:

12

Mr. Chief Justice, good

At the heart of this appeal is a matter of

13

statutory construction.

14

million in public funds under the Victims Protection and

15

Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.

16

is at the blue brief, page 11a, that a party electing to

17

receive such funds must relinquish rights with respect

18

to enforcement against property that is at issue in

19

claims against the United States before an international

20

tribunal or that is the subject of awards by such

21

tribunal.

22

Respondent received $2.3

TRIA provides, and this

The property in question here is the Cubic

23

judgment.

Respondent renounced rights to attach the

24

Cubic judgment because in case B/61 before the

25

Iran-United States Claims Tribunal at the Hague the
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

United States has demanded that any awards Iran receives

2

in its claim against the United States be set off by the

3

amount of the Cubic judgment.

4

the Cubic judgment is released from Respondent's lien

5

and is remitted to Iran's Ministry of Defense.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This can only occur if

Well, they could

7

have agreed that they have a bank account somewhere and

8

any amounts would be set off by that.

9

make that bank account at issue with respect to their

10
11

That wouldn't

claim.
MR. BEDERMAN:

No, in that scenario I agree

12

with you, Mr. Chief Justice, that that would not be

13

implicated, because I think the clear import of the

14

statutory language here that Congress is trying to

15

achieve is that being at issue -- as you'll notice, the

16

statutory provision in 201(c) is disjunctive.

17

to claims against the United States -- at issue in

18

claims against the United States before an international

19

tribunal, or that is the subject of an award.

20

think the disjunctive character of the statute might

21

indicate that the at-issue prong includes a broader set

22

of property than would be indicated possibly by the

23

"subject of an award."

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It refers

So I

So it doesn't matter

that Iran recognizes that this would be used to set off
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a judgment it might obtain, because you just said, well

2

they could -- a bank account could be used to set it off

3

and that's not sufficient.

4

MR. BEDERMAN:

Well, the mutual -- let me be

5

clear.

The mutual position of Iran and the United

6

States before the Claims Tribunal is that the Cubic

7

judgment, because it's related to a claim within the

8

tribunal's jurisdiction -- and I think that's a key

9

limiting principle here.

The United States would not be

10

entitled to set off amounts in bank accounts that are

11

attributable to other parties or other aspects that are

12

not implicated in claims or defenses before the

13

tribunal.

14

So clearly an examination of the tribunal's

15

jurisdiction and the relevant claims or defenses that

16

are before the tribunal is relevant here.

17

not espousing a position before this Court that any

18

inchoate property located anywhere in the world would be

19

blanketed with immunity under this provision.

20

necessary to reach that conclusion in order to find for

21

Petitioner here.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Petitioner is

It's not

The United States at some

23

stage told the tribunal in The Hague that the Cubic

24

judgment -- and now I'm quoting -- "has nothing to do

25

with matters before the international tribunal."
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

"Nothing to do with."

2

MR. BEDERMAN:

Yes, that is the language

3

used by the United States in a memorial before the

4

tribunal.

5

this is clear in the gray brief at pages 81 in note 32

6

and the gray brief at pages 83 to 85, and in the

7

lodgment, that if -- if Iran receives an award in case

8

B/61 it must be offset or set off, or "recouped" is

9

sometimes the language used in the correspondence

The United States has also indicated, and

10

between the two governments before the tribunal, by the

11

amount of the Cubic judgment.

12

I won't speak for the United States position

13

before the tribunal.

14

that, of course, Justice Ginsburg.

15

can interpret that remark is to indicate that obviously

16

before the tribunal is the issue of the United States'

17

obligations to Iran under the Algiers Accords.

18

Cubic judgment deals, of course, with the private

19

disposition of the contractual relationship between

20

Iran's Ministry of Defense and the Cubic military

21

contractor.

22

The United States is here to do
But the only way I

The

Now Respondents take the position that these

23

two make the matters unrelated.

But if you review

24

carefully the tribunal's jurisdiction as encompassing

25

both claims and counterclaims, and according to the
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Algiers Accords in the claims settlement declaration,

2

counterclaims include that which arises out of the same

3

contract, transaction or occurrence that constitutes the

4

subject matter of the claim.

stated before the tribunal as of this moment.

MR. BEDERMAN:

I'm sorry, I didn't hear the

first.

10

There is no counterclaim

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There is no counterclaim

in the case before the tribunal.

11

MR. BEDERMAN:

That's right.

The United

12

States did not file a formal counterclaim in case B/61,

13

but it has made a demand for a setoff.

14

tribunal rules, a setoff can be the subject of notice

15

under Rule 19-3 or an amendment or certainly comes under

16

waiver of objection provision in Rule 30.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And within the

I was going to ask that

18

question.

19

it is contemplated that there will be cases under the

20

rules, where the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal does

21

determine that there should or should not be an offset.

22

In other words, there are cases or at least

MR. BEDERMAN:

There -- there certainly have

23

been cases, if you are speaking of the tribunal's

24

earlier jurisprudence in terms of offsetting claims.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. BEDERMAN:

Yes, there has certainly been

2

ample tribunal precedent which the United States has

3

relied upon in making this demand for a setoff.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But assuming -- assuming

5

the tribunal takes up some such issue as Justice Kennedy

6

has mentioned, it will start with the assumption that

7

the Cubic judgment is in fact a valid judgment.

8

not look behind the Cubic judgment as such, will it?

9

MR. BEDERMAN:

It will

Of course, the validity of

10

the Cubic judgment does remain on appeal when the Ninth

11

Circuit -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that's an entirely

13

separate proceeding.

14

not been reversed through the appellate process that it

15

is going through, then the tribunal will take the Cubic

16

judgment as it finds it.

Assuming the Cubic judgment has

MR. BEDERMAN:

I would assume it would.

And

I assume JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

Doesn't it make it

pretty tough to say that the Cubic judgment is at issue?
MR. BEDERMAN:

No, Justice Souter.

If -- if

22

we understand Congress' -- I don't -- I think this

23

matter can be resolved by a straightforward textual

24

approach in looking at TRIA section 201(c).

25

though, if we are looking at congressional intent here,
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Evidently,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it is to protect the United States' litigation position

2

before the tribunal.

3

Cubic judgment would simply be allowing Respondent to

4

remove a source of money that would be available -

5

To allow the attachment of the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I mean, I think we

6

understand that.

And -- and it's clear that the United

7

States, in effect, is taking the position that that's

8

all we need to bear in mind.

9

the drafting of the statute did not go as far as it

But it suggests to me that

10

might have gone to protect the interests of the United

11

States.

12

MR. BEDERMAN:

I won't speak, of course, for

13

the United States' position.

14

is that where property has been identified to the

15

tribunal as being related to a claim or defense within

16

its jurisdiction, and the availability of that property

17

affects the relief that can be granted by the tribunal,

18

it is at issue.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Petitioner's position

Explain to me why it

20

would effect the relief?

Because suppose Iran doesn't

21

get the proceeds of the Cubic judgment, but instead a

22

creditor of Iran, in this case Elahi, a creditor gets

bill.

25

States equally get the credit whether the Cubic judgment

2

Elahi?

3

MR. BEDERMAN:

Well, obviously we await the

4

tribunal's award in this respect.

5

on the tribunal's past precedents, the benefit in terms

6

of finding a breach of the Algiers Accords as it would

7

or it must in this case to find in favor of Iran, would

8

indicate that the benefits accruing for certain setoffs

9

must ultimately come back to Iran in order to be

And I believe, based

credited in the way that you suggest.

11

I think it is an improper position to

12

suggest that if a creditor of Iran or Iran's Ministry of

13

Defense in this instance can claim or assert the lien so

14

that somehow it's credited to Iran's account, so to

15

speak, in calculating the setoff of the tribunal.

16

has not been the tribunal's jurisprudence in terms of

17

examining the implications of a breach by the United

18

States under the Algiers Accords.

cases -

And in a number of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

that I would just like clarification on.

22

that the Cubic judgment is on appeal to the Ninth

23

Circuit.

Would you -- something
You mentioned

It has been on appeal since June of '98?

24

MR. BEDERMAN:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That

Yes, ma'am.
And there are cross

2

judgment by the respective sides, and why is it pending

3

for ten years?

4

What are the positions taken about that

MR. BEDERMAN:

That has been a mystery to me

5

as well.

In fact, there has been a resolution by Cubic

6

Defense Systems and Iran's Ministry of Defense and as

7

soon as the Court renders its judgment in this case,

8

that matter will finally move to disposition.

9

bit odd that the underlying issue of Cubic's objections

It is a

10

to the district court's enforcement of the International

11

Chamber of Commerce or ICC arbitral award has pended for

12

so long.

13

made more sense to have disposed of those issues and

14

then allow the disposition of the liens to be resolved

15

by the Court.

16

I would have thought, logically, it would have

Essentially, it is Cubic's appeal

17

challenging aspects of the district court's enforcement

18

under the New York convention of the ICC arbitral award.

19

I think to the extent that there is a counterclaim it's

20

simply that there were some bases for support of the

21

judgment which Iran's Ministry of Defense would have put

22

forward in addition to the district court.

23

I understand in terms of the ruling of Judge Brewster

24

originally in the district court on this manner.

25

That's what

So, yes, it is unfortunate that the
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

underlying validity of the Cubic judgment still remains

2

open as a matter of appeal.

3

But again to return to your point,

4

Justice Ginsburg, in Cases 815 and 821 before the

5

tribunal this question of what would be the

6

implications, financial and otherwise, for the United

7

States being found by the tribunal to be in breach of

8

the Algiers Accords because of the failure of not

9

allowing the export of Iranian property or repatriation

10

of Iranian property to the United States has been

11

explicated.

12

tribunal has found the United States to be in breach of

13

Algiers Accords obligations.

14

And, in fact, in already one instance the

So again, I can't speak for what a ruling in

15

the tribunal would be.

16

the Iranian position before the tribunal would be that

17

in the instance that if Mr. Elahi or any other lienor

18

were successful in attaching the Cubic judgment that in

19

such a situation it should not be credited as a setoff

20

under these circumstances.

21

All I can suggest is certainly

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could -- let's assume

22

that the -- that Iran is able to execute on the Cubic

23

judgment.

24

States, given the 2007 blocking order?

25

Could it take the proceeds out of the United

MR. BEDERMAN:

Well, I mean, the issue of
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the secretary of state's October 2007 designation, which

2

I think is what you are referring to, is a late

3

development in this case.

4

three months after the Ninth Circuit's amended opinion.

5

Of course, that occurred

My submission to this Court is that the

6

appropriate disposition, assuming the Court well takes

7

Petitioner's position that Respondent has actually

8

relinquished its claim under TRIA, is to remand back to

9

the district court, because then we would have two new

10

sets of lienors, Mr. Raffi and Mr. Rubin.

11

before the district court that factual issues like

12

whether the designation of the "Ministry of Defense and

13

Armed Forces Logistics," which is what is actually named

14

in the blocking order, actually covers the Ministry of

15

Defense and Support for the Armed Forces of the Islamic

16

Republic of Iran, who is your Petitioner today.

17

It would be

The issue of whether designations cover

18

particular entities or aliases of entities is an

19

intensity factual one; the D.C. Circuit in the National

20

Council of Resistance case, Chief Justice Roberts, an

21

opinion you are well aware of at the D.C. Circuit.

22

These are intensely factual inquiries about whether

23

aliases of particular organizations are covered by

24

designations.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You mentioned -- you

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

mentioned that there were other claimants or others -

2

others who would like to execute -

3

MR. BEDERMAN:

Other lienors.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- other lienors -- other

5

attachments.

6

well, what would be the effect of those other liens?

7

And so, you said in the end -- well -

MR. BEDERMAN:

My understanding,

8

Justice Ginsburg, is in both the cases of Mr. Rubin and

9

Mr. Raffi, as far as I am aware, they have not made the

10

relinquishment election under TRIA as Dr. Elahi has done

11

here.

12

proviso, they would not be subject to the at-issue

13

question that is now before the Court.

14

And because they have not made the relinquishment

Iran's Ministry of Defense has other

15

substantive defenses against their liens, which we

16

appropriately presented before the district court.

17

The only submission I am making to this

18

Court at this time is that it is not necessary for this

19

Court exercising plenary authority to decide whether

20

it's a blocked asset.

21

because, notwithstanding the U.S. position, I think

22

there are questions of whether your Petitioner is a

23

covered entity under the -- under the designation, and

24

whether in fact it is the beneficial owner, whether

25

Iran's Air Force is the beneficial owner of this claim.

That is appropriate for remand

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And there are other substantive defenses that claim

2

retroactivity, as well.

3

it's appropriate -

4

So, again, I just don't think

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But going back to the main

5

issue, the only reason that this is at issue before the

6

Iran tribunal is because it might be a setoff in the

7

event of judgment in favor of Iran?

8
9
10

MR. BEDERMAN:
for setoff.

Yes.

Whether it is available

And again, I want to be clear that CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's the -- that's

11

the only basis for your argument?

12

broader suggestion that these are, to some extent,

13

substitute assets for the assets that are at issue?

14

MR. BEDERMAN:

I thought it was a

Well, I mean, that may be one

15

useful analytic in thinking about this.

16

imagining the interest of the Court in understanding the

17

tribunal's jurisdiction under the Algiers Accords and

18

what the tribunal has already ruled, and that's why I

19

think respectful consideration might be appropriate

20

here, inasmuch as the tribunal, in interpreting its

21

jurisdiction under the Algiers Accords, which is

22

essentially its organic instrument, has made a

23

determination in Case B/66 that the substantive

24

contracts at issue here between Cubic and the Iranian

25

Air Force are at issue in case B/61.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

I was trying in

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can you -- can you

2

articulate a general test in a sentence or two about how

3

you decide whether particular assets are at issue?

4

MR. BEDERMAN:

Yes.

I will repeat the one I

5

-- I rendered before because I think it is the most

6

useful analytic, and I -- I take no credit.

7

essentially Judge Fisher's analysis in the dissent

8

below.

9

has been identified to the Tribunal -- and certainly the

10

Cubic judgment and the proceedings that have occurred in

11

the Federal district court in -- in Southern California

12

and now the Ninth Circuit and now here have been

13

identified to the Tribunal in mutual representations and

14

undertakings by the parties.

15

been identified to the Tribunal as being related to a

16

claim or defense within the Tribunal's jurisdiction -

17

and I think that is the key limiting principle here.

18

That's -- there is a criticism that an expansive reading

19

of TRIA's "At Issue" provision will allow Iran and the

20

United States, as unlikely as it sounds, to mutually

21

collude to cover various properties and assets around

22

the world, I think noting that the -- that the Cubic

23

judgment is within the Court's jurisdiction as

24

understood under the Algiers Accords Claims Settlement

25

Declaration, Article 2, paragraph 3.

This is

As he indicated, that -- that -- where property

can be granted by the Tribunal.

4

hypothesizing here.

5

in cases like Owens Corning, Futura Trading and Computer

6

Services, that when you have a situation avoiding a

7

double recovery, that a setoff derived from collateral

8

proceedings, even absent privity of contract with the

9

sovereign seeking adjustment and with respect to

And, again, we are not

The Tribunal has already indicated

10

different causes of action, a setoff is still

11

appropriate within the Tribunal.

12

So it's both an avoidance of a -- of a

13

double-recovery rule and also a notion that a -- a

14

certain offset is -- is related as within the -- the

15

jurisdiction of the tribunal as arising again from the

16

same contract transaction or occurrence.

here there is no question, based on the materials that

case that Iran's position in respect to those

attachments is that those attachments, insofar as they

25

are valid and executed, require a setoff from whatever

we owe Iran or vice-versa?

2

MR. BEDERMAN:

My understanding, if you are

3

speaking of me characterizing the United States'

4

position -

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

I'm saying I take

6

it from something I have read in this that Iran believes

7

that if, in fact, it won a judgment and that judgment is

8

from someone like Cubic -

9

MR. BEDERMAN:

10

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- who they thought was

11

prevented from delivering planes because of the embargo

12

-- so it was relevant -- that that judgment, which they

13

get if they collect on it, should be deducted from other

it would use that holding against the United States and

that.

But that's not saying

there is now a new and independent reason why the asset

and we agree with Respondent on this point -- that as of

The Secretary of State designated the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

that that means that because it's a blocked asset, then

5

Dr. Elahi can get it, but Iran itself couldn't get it?

6

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Elahi, Respondent

Elahi, could get it if he had not relinquished his

rights to attach -

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

Yes.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

-- assets at issue

11

before the tribunal.

As of right now, the asset is

12

blocked and Iran could not repatriate it, as of right

13

now.

14

of right now it is frozen and Petitioner cannot

15

repatriate it.

Of course, blocking orders can be amended, but as

same consequence that is going to come from the fact

that I suggested before?

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, you are

8

right, Your Honor, that is the position of the United

9

States.

And earlier Your Honor quoted language from the

10

oral argument of the United States that the -- or maybe

11

it was one of our briefs -- that the Cubic judgment

12

is -- that the tribunal doesn't have to -

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14
15

It has nothing to do with

matters before the MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That is in the

16

context of our saying that, whether or not -- in the

17

view of the United States, whether or not Petitioner

18

ever collects that money, the United States is entitled

19

to an offset, and in fact, we believe it's a complete

20

defense to Iran's claim.

21

Of course, Petitioner's argument -- or

22

Iran's argument before the tribunal is that it is -

23

that the United States is entitled to a reduction of

24

liability only if Iran actual receives the assets.

25

that's why the language of the statute is written more
26
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

broadly when the litigation before the tribunal is

2

ongoing.

3

before the tribunal is not subject to attachment by one

4

who has relinquished, and that's because this Court nor

5

any other lower court in the United States is supposed

6

to pre-judge the merits of those respective positions.

7

Iran's position -- and it's on page 85a of the United

8

States' appendix -- is that the awarded amount, unless

9

received by Iran, cannot be offset against any relief

10

which the United States may be found to owe Iran.

11
12

At that point any property that is at issue

So that is Iran's position.

That is at

issue before the tribunal.

13

The Respondent would have the Court believe

14

that the proceedings in the tribunal are in the nature

as you and Iran get together and say this asset is at

issue in a situation where whether it's at issue or not

3

4

be a very self-serving legal test.

5

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, Your Honor, I

6

don't believe that this Court needs to consider what the

7

outer reaches are.

characterizes it, and this is at page, again, at page 85

9

of the U.S. appendix, that the Cubic judgment, quote

In this case, this is -- Iran

10

"constitutes an integral part of the remedy sought in

11

12

This isn't an offset or a counterclaim.

13

Justice Ginsburg, you previously alluded to the fact the

14

United States did not file a counterclaim.

15

because this is not some unrelated counterclaim the

16

United States has against Iran.

17

of Iran's claim against the United States.

18

in the view of the United States, Iran's claim entirely.

At the very least, it reduces the amount of Iran's claim

20

against the United States.

But what we can ask

is, can we conceive of -- and I think it's relatively

easy to conceive of -- an award of the tribunal that

says, the United States owes Iran $2.8 million; if the

Cubic judgment is received by Iran, the United States

12

owes Iran nothing.

13

the Cubic judgment is the subject of the award of the

And clearly, in that circumstance,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I don't know that it's the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

6

I think the previous 25 or so minutes has

7

demonstrated one sort of overarching fact, which is that

8

there is an enormous risk, if this Court decides to

9

interpret the language of this statute broadly, that it

10

will easily sweep beyond any kind of arrangements

11

between Iran and the United States in ways that

12

fundamentally, obviously, disadvantage the very people

13

that Congress clearly intended to benefit by this entire

14

statutory scheme.

This is a scheme that was designed to

16

provide remedies, recoveries, to the victims of

17

terrorism.

18

was discussed in the first 25 or so minutes of this

19

argument, the victims of terrorism are completely

20

shunted aside on basic -- on the basis of very technical

21

ways of reading it.

22

And somehow in the scheme of everything that

But if we go back to the language of the

23

statute, which is in the Petitioner's brief at 11a, it

24

talks about "enforcement against property that is at

25

issue in claims against the United States."
32
Alderson Reporting Company

So the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

notion that we would focus on the word "property," as it

2

relates to the tribunal and that the tribunal has in

3

front of it, is a natural consequence of the language of

that provision.

look at the logic is to review how often the United

equipment that we bought, or give us the economic value

of that.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, why is that

7

very different from this situation, where you have an

8

arbitration award saying that you, Cubic, owe the

9

equivalent of what you should have -- what you would

10

have provided to Iran, if there hadn't been the

11

revolution?

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, there are two answers

13

to that.

The first one is remember precisely what the

14

arbitration award is.

15

value of the asset.

16

rejected by the arbitrator.

17

for the value of a separate contract between Cubic and

18

the Canadian government.

19

specifically the arbitrator said with respect to the

20

underlying ACMR contract with Iran, that was mutually

21

walked away from by both parties, and then there was a

22

separate agreement that was entered into between the

23

parties, and that was the basis for the arbitration

award saying the value of breach of that secondary

agreement is the part that serves as the arbitral award.

Right.

So what is the -

7

it seems at the moment, frankly you could read it either

way.

that we blocked and they get some money, and they did it

Let's imagine that -- that Cubic sold some jets

10

under their contract, and they got 2 million dollars.

11

And suppose they said, we owe Iran this money, and they

12

pay Iran the money, and Iran puts it in a bank account

13

or buys the grocery store.

All right?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

It makes it simpler.

11

the question is, does Iran get it or does the United

12

States get it, in the situation where the two other

people -- leaving Elahi out of it -- can attach it.

consistent with the proper running, in the interests of

4

the United States, of the Iranian-American Claims

Tribunal.

6

That's a worthy goal, and that's

But it was to compensate them

And so this is just the kind of issue we

7

don't want to simply take away and let the victim have,

8

because there is a strong risk the tribunal will rule

9

against us, and we will have to pay it twice.

10

Okay.

That's the argument against you.

11

Now, what's the argument for you?

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

First of all -

Yes.
A significant purpose of this

15

entire exercise obviously is to provide redress to the

16

victims of terrorism.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's one, but 201(d) is a specific

19

statutory construction provision which seems to suggest

20

that Congress says that if there are doubts about how to

21

apply this particular provision, you ought to put the

22

thumb on the scale in favor of the victim.

23

you will give meaning to section 201(c)(4) of the TRIA

24

if you adopt a position consistent with our position.

25

So you do -

The reality is that given that there are two
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

more lienholders in line, none of this has anything to

2

do with Iran and with the way the tribunal is going to

3

proceed, because even if you were to say that Dr. Elahi

4

is not entitled to this, there is no relinquishment

5

claim with respect to the others, so this money is never

6

going back to Iran, under any set of circumstances.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

That creates the issue,

8

because the question is whether money that never goes

9

back to Iran, but rather goes to an attaching person, is

10

money that is or money that is not subtracted from the

11

amount that the United States owes Iran.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

And that question is the

before the commission.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

But the problem with this,

19

Justice Breyer, is that this is a relinquishment

20

provision.

21

limited resources, 20 percent of the judgment -- and

22

that is only 20 percent of the compensatory judgment and

23

completely lose the punitive judgment -- in return for

24

that you have to relinquish certain rights; and it seems

25

to me that Congress would not have adopted the a

It -- it is saying to us in return for these

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

provision that said and the rights you relinquish are

2

essentially unknowable under any circumstances and

3

extend to the ends of the earth.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

What I -

They are totally knowable.

5

They are totally knowable.

In order to decide what they

6

are all you have to do is to look at the issues before

7

the commission and decide whether those issues concern

8

specific, concrete property; that is, the property that

9

you have an interest in.

10

With my grocery store, with my bank account,

11

and with this claim, it is absolutely specific, and Iran

12

has put before the commission the question of whether if

13

you pay the money to an attaching person, we don't get

14

it, or we do get it.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

Justice Breyer That's what I gather.

Now

you can tell me I'm wrong on that if you want.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

The parties have been very

19

specific about it, and we cited in a series of

20

quotations about what is the property at issue here; and

21

the property at issue, Justice Breyer is the ACMR system

22

or the economic value of the ACMR system.

23

at issue in this case is the value of the Cubic

24

judgment.

25

the Cubic judgment specifically before the tribunal, and

What is not

First of all, there was an effort to bring

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it was rejected as having no jurisdiction, certainly no

2

jurisdiction over Cubic and then no jurisdiction over

3

the United States' part of the Cubic judgment because

4

that was not a contract between -

JUSTICE BREYER:
the ACMR system.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

They are trying to attach

the Cubic judgment.

10

They did They are trying to attach

The ACMR judgment is in Canada.

MR. PHILLIPS:

But that's the whole point of

11

this.

The property at issue before the tribunal is the

12

ACMR system, and indeed in 1981 when this was originally

13

brought what Iran wanted was the ACMR system.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that's one piece of

15

property.

16

is the judgment, and the way it's at issue is I take it

17

that two other people are saying, we attach it; Iran

18

says because they attach it, you don't subtract it from

19

the ACMR judgment; and we are saying, even though they

20

attach it, you subtract it, and therefore it's before

21

the tribunal as well.

22
23
24
25

The other piece of property that is at issue

That's my understanding at the moment, and
I'm asking you to explain why that's wrong.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Breyer, there is no

question that the fact that there are subsequent
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

lienholders in line affects the possibility, but I would

2

have thought it would only affect it in a way that is

3

positive for me.

4

doesn't have any relevance to the -- to the Iran

5

tribunal if we don't ever get the money; and the reality

6

is whether Dr. Elahi gets the money or the other

7

lienholders get the money, Iran is never going to get

8

the money, which says to me it's not at issue under any

9

theory of the case in front of the U.S.-Iranian claims

10

Because Iran is saying, look, this

tribunal.

11

And so that would be my quickest answer to

12

that; to the extent that you have other lienholders, it

13

simply means that there really is nothing at issue

14

there.

15

But it still seems to me that the better way JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why not?

I mean, the

16

question I raised before, why wouldn't the United States

17

be urging that it gets credit, whether Iran gets the

18

money or whether the people who are creditors of Iran

19

get the money.

20

be able to have -

21

In either case, the United States should

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, the United States

22

would still have that -- would still have that argument,

23

but it's not a claim against the United States, which is

24

what's required under the statute that we are dealing

25

with here when it's viewed that way.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But Iran might say in the

claim that we brought against you, the United States,

implicates a breach of obligations that you have that

7

United States would say, no, that's not true.

would have to examine the Cubic judgment.

it's at issue before the court.

MR. PHILLIPS:

And then the

So that means

No, I don't think there is

anybody whose going to -- well, maybe there is some

sense in which examining the Cubic judgment, but I don't

think the tribunal has remotely been asked to or will

14

under any circumstances be asked to review the Cubic

judgment.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There might be in the

argument that there are two obligations, and there is a

setoff or that there is a setoff.

20

There might -- there might be an

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I mean, I think there

21

is no question these are for two different obligations.

22

And I think that's why candidly the Court ought to

decide that this is not property at issue here, because

it is so clearly unrelated to the weapons system itself

or to any monetization of the weapons system.

Remember

the Cubic judgment comes from an arbitral award that

to do with a completely separate contractual undertaking

between the Cubic and the Canadian government -

substantial degree of argument on that point.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't know how there could

11

be an argument on that point, Justice Kennedy.

If you

12

read the opinion of the arbitrator, it is absolutely

13

clear that the -- that the underlying agreement between

14

Iran and Cubic with respect to the arms sale was

15

mutually terminated by the parties, and a new agreement

16

entered into in order to resell those properties to

17

Canada.

The opinion is crystalline in that regard.

18

And it was on the basis of the violation of

that separate agreement that the -- that Cubic was then

held to be liable to Iran for the $2.8 million.

Which is what they

I don't see that that adds anything to your

Well, it just says that you

6

move even further down the road from what are the

7

properties that are, in fact, at issue before the

8

tribunal.

Right, so Iran says,

look, you are not going to ship us the planes, whatever

11

it is, you are not -

You were not going

to give us the money, right?

dispute.

is ours.

Mr. Chief Justice, that -

that -- they may have been able to make that argument.

they made, which represents the property at issue in the

claims, is first, give us back the arms; and then two,

Well, why would

5

Cubic enter into a contract with Iran to give them money

6

if it wasn't taking the place of the money they owed

7

them in the original agreement?

8
9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the question was, they

were going to try to go forward in these arrangements.

10

And it was a, you know, complicated problem because you

11

couldn't tell whether or not you would ever be able to

12

send things back to Iran, et cetera.

13

perfectly happy to enter into an agreement where they

14

would say, look, we will just do the best we can and see

15

how it turns out.

And so, they were

16

I mean, in reality, the litigation in front

17

of the Ninth Circuit, obviously, on the Cubic judgment,

18

Cubic is screaming loud and clear that they don't think

19

they owe a nickel as a consequence of this arrangement

20

that there had been no breach of anything under any

21

circumstances, and that there is not a penny that's to

22

be owed.

23

unfortunate that this has moved in this sequence.

24

we don't really have -

25

And as counsel said earlier, it's in some ways

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
45
Alderson Reporting Company

So,

Do you know why it

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was pending for ten years?

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it was stayed as a

3

consequence of this other litigation -- as a consequence

4

of these proceedings in order to allow, I think in

5

general the Iran claims tribunal to -- to sort out, at

6

least, some portion of these issues.

7

be -- I mean, we have moved -- I mean, we are not a

party.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It would obvious

So the stayed

10

because it was at issue before the Iranian claims

11

tribunal?

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

I mean, the truth is

13

just as the issue was a more important issue for the

14

United States prior to the new blocking order, you know,

15

the questions that could potentially have arisen were

16

potentially more important to the claims tribunal at the

17

outset.

18

that there's no relationship between the two.

19

As the litigation has played out, it turns out

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, the -- the other

20

thing -- and I think this counts against you, but maybe

21

you have an answer to it, that there could be a lot of

22

property that was directly at issue in '79 or '80 that

23

Iran didn't get.

24

kinds of things happened with property, and you get more

25

of it or you get less of it.

And because they didn't get it, all

And during the interim

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

years all kinds of things happened.

2

And it could be that those transformations

3

at different times are directly before the tribunal,

4

irrespective to how much damages you are going to get,

5

and how much -- we can easily think of cases if we have

6

three or four hours.

But you see where I am going?

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Sure.
Now, I can understand

Congress in passing this statute having one of two

10

possible things:

11

arbitrary line here because it's a compromise, and what

12

we will do is, you can go ahead, victim, and seize

13

anything you want, as long as it doesn't narrowly fit

14

within this.

15

compromise.

16

One is say we are just going to cut an

That's a somewhat arbitrary line but a

MR. PHILLIPS:

But it also provides

17

protection for victims, right, and those are the people

18

who are the most -

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

The other way to look at it

20

is to say, well, what we that had in mind here is we

21

will pay these victims something; you know, they are

22

going to get something right from Congress right now,

23

because they are hurt.

24

don't want you taking action that will really affect our

25

liability to Iran.

But in return from that, we

And if it's the second, then we
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

needed broader definition; if it's the first, we don't.

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Breyer, I think the

3

Hague cases are the place to look in terms of trying to

4

understand this, because what it's what -- Hague, that

5

line of cases all involve efforts to seize consular

6

properties of Iran and all arose prior to the Accords,

7

and every one of those courts of appeals has concluded

8

that each of those properties is beyond the ability of

9

the courts to attach all of those properties.

10

And -- and it seems to me that what Congress

11

was concerned about was having inconsistent claims

12

potentially arise in both the district -- in federal

13

court in the United States and in front of the claims

14

tribunal.

15

So where you have a situation where the

16

claims tribunal says, look, that's a consular property

17

that belongs to the Iranian government, you should

18

return it, and have the United States have to show up in

19

front of that tribunal and say, oh, excuse me, but

20

unfortunately, we have been forced to sell that property

21

under a federal court order and the embarrassment that

22

arises from that.

23

Congress had in mind, or at least is clearly covered by

24

this and the case law or all the case law up to this

25

point that has dealt with it has consistently ruled in

That seems to me so clearly what

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

favor of the United States and Iran in that context.

2

But there is no reason to go beyond that context in

3

order to deprive the clear victims of terrorism of a

4

meaningful remedy.

5

And I think, Justice Breyer, just to be

6

clear about this, we got money back, to be sure.

7

substantial portion of the money we got back came from

8

the values of the properties that the United States

9

seized from Iran that they've used, they have leased out

10

embassies and stuff like that.

11

that comes out of the United States' fist.

12

A

And that is not property

So it's not reasonable to assume, as the

13

government does, that simply because these moneys were

14

paid out, that there is some huge relinquishment that is

15

required there.

16

sense for this Court to narrowly construe this.

It seems to me that it makes much more

17

I guess the last thing I would say in that

18

regard is, that insofar as we can tell, this case will

19

affect one party -- actually, I guess the other two

20

lienholders behind us.

But realistically, there are no

21

cases in the pipeline.

There is no other litigation

22

that is on going out there.

23

mean, it's kind of unusual for this Court, but this is

24

the only case that we can figure that this applies to.

25

This is a singular -- I

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, but the point

Official - Subject to Final Review

is, depending on how it comes out, once you give a

2

argument to the Iranians that they can raise with the

3

claims tribunal that will affect far more than your one

off the table.

13

But after the intervening

We are no longer defending the Ninth

MR. BEDERMAN:

If I can make just a few

19

points.

In response to Respondent counsel's assertion

20

that in the International Chamber of Commerce arbitral

21

award there's been so form of novation here, which makes

22

the connection between the ACMR and the Cubic judgment

23

somehow attenuated.

24

tribunal's -- the panel's discussion, this is at the

25

joint appendix at page 47.

I think that's -- by the

1

The panel makes very clear that under the

2

sales contract credit has to be given to Iran for its

3

advance payment.

4

salvage value of the ACMR.

5

indicating was that Iran was not entitled to specific

6

performance here, to make that ruling is not a finding

7

of a novation in the sense which would respond to

8

counsel using that phrase.

9

attenuation here.

10

Here you have a breakout of the
All that the panel was

So, I don't see the

Speaking to the assertion that, again, the

11

enormous risk presented by this case of the broad

12

construction of the congressional intent, I think if you

13

look carefully at the language at the blue brief at 11a

14

of the statutory construction provision -- that was part

15

of the colloquy between the Chief Justice and

16

Respondent's counsel.

17

completely reserves, if not begs the question of whether

18

the Cubic judgment is, quote, an asset otherwise

19

available under the section for attachment.

20

And if you read this, it

So, I think it completely doesn't answer,

21

one way or the other -- a finger on the scale, as

22

Respondent's counsel has evocably said, or some form of

23

command by Congress to this Court.

24

that question for the Court's analysis.

25

It simply reserves

In response to Justice Ginsburg's last
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question to Respondent's counsel, the one thing I would

2

point out to you again, is another clue in the statute.

3

If we look at the Victims Protection Act, which was the

4

predecessor statute here, section 2002(c), what Congress

5

wanted to protect is the right of the United States to,

6

quote, pursue these subrogated rights as claims or

7

offsets of the United States in appropriate ways.

8

So, again, Congress has contemplated the

9

notion that there will be a process of setoffs either

10

before the Iran U.S. claims tribunal or in some other

11

context, which I'm not sure I can imagine beyond what

12

response counsel has said.

13

broad remedial thrust of TRIA, which Petitioner is not

14

denying -- it's not our place to deny that -- is

15

nonetheless tempered by these carefully crafted

16

provisions in the statute.

So, to suggest that the

We would support, obviously, reversal of the
lower court's opinion.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:09 p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
