CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Baker.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. MILLER BAKER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9
10

MR. BAKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The principal question before the Court

11

today is whether nonparties to an arbitration agreement

12

that are otherwise entitled to enforce that agreement

13

under State law are foreclosed as a matter of law from

14

seeking relief under section 3 of the Federal

15

Arbitration Act.

16

Respondents' argument that section 3

17

forecloses such relief to nonparties is contrary to both

18

the text of section 3 and the structure of the FAA.

19

Nothing in the text of section 3 forecloses nonparty

20

enforcement rights, and under the structure of the Act

21

section 3 is a procedural device to enforce, rather than

22

a substantive limitation upon, State law arbitration

23

rights made applicable by section 2.

24
25

I'll begin with the text of section 3.
Under section 3, a stay is mandatory if the issue in
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

suit is, quote, "referable to arbitration under such an

2

agreement."

3

that determine whether or not an issue is referable to

4

arbitration under the agreement.

5

must be able to enforce the agreement.

6

plaintiff must be bound by the agreement.

7

the claim must fall within the scope of the agreement.

8
9
10

We contend that there are three elements

First, the applicant
Second, the
And, third,

Nothing in section 3 limits who can enforce
the agreement.

To answer that question we have to turn

to section 2.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Before you leave the

12

text, it says as you -- "referable to arbitration under

13

an agreement," but then it says "shall on application of

14

one of the parties."

15

parties to the litigation or parties to the arbitration

16

agreement?

17

MR. BAKER:

How do we know whether that is

Your Honor, it's -- it's clear

18

from the -- from the context it's referring to parties

19

to the action.

20

reference to parties, and it's parties to the

21

controversy.

22

action in which the section 3 stay is sought.

23

4, likewise, the companion enforcement provision, refers

24

to parties to the controversy.

25

Likewise, in section 4 there's a

So section 3 refers to parties to the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Section

And what -- what is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the "controversy"?

2

subject to arbitration or something else?

3

Is it the controversy asserted to be

MR. BAKER:

Well, "controversy" is in -- in

4

section 4, Your Honor, as opposed to section 3.

5

controversy in this case is a tort claim against various

6

defendants.

7

assert that they are entitled to enforce the arbitration

8

clause, and under that clause this controversy is

9

supposed to be arbitrated.

10

But the

And that -- the Petitioners in this case

Now, section 2 is the primary substantive

11

provision of the Act.

12

questions concerning the enforceability of an

13

arbitration agreement, including who may enforce that

14

agreement, are decided by State law.

15

decision in Perry v. Thomas recognized and applied this

16

principle.

17

Section 2 establishes that

This Court's

In Perry this Court remanded to State court

18

to decide the question of whether nonparties could

19

enforce an arbitration agreement.

20

Court instructed the lower court to apply State law to

21

determine the very question that's before this case,

22

whether non -- before this Court, whether nonparties

23

could enforce the arbitration agreement.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

In so doing, this

In practice, are there

decisions in which -- and I'm assuming that you are
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

right on the jurisdictional question -- in which a

2

nonparty to the arbitration agreement but a party to the

3

litigation has, in fact, succeeded in getting a stay

4

under section 3?

5

I mean, one question is -- and that's the

6

question on the merits -- assuming that a -- that a

7

party to the litigation, not a party to the arbitration

8

agreement, can come to court and say, court, stay the

9

action pending arbitration.

Have there been cases in

10

which section 3 stays have been issued on the request of

11

someone who is not party to the arbitration agreement

12

but is a litigant in the case?

13

MR. BAKER:

Yes, there have been, Your

14

Honor.

15

for the last 60 years it has been a recognized, settled

16

principle of FAA law that nonparties to an arbitration

17

agreement that are otherwise entitled to enforce the

18

agreement are able to seek and obtain stays under

19

section 3.

20

And there -- there are numerous cases.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In fact,

Well, the question -

21

ability is one thing.

It means they -- they have the

22

capacity to apply under section 3.

23

how in practice -- I mean, here's a case where you have

24

three parties together counseling a certain tax shelter.

25

One of them enters an arbitration agreement with the
6
Alderson Reporting Company

I was just wondering

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

enterprise that they are advising.

2

sophisticated players, do not.

3

The other two,

My question is, conceding jurisdiction, it

4

seems to me unlikely that a court would listen to two

5

such people who were perfectly equipped to get an

6

arbitration agreement themselves and didn't.

7

MR. BAKER:

Well, Your Honor, it depends

8

upon the facts and the law.

It may well be that those

9

nonparties have no arbitration rights, in which case a

10

section 3 stay would not be available -- available to

11

them.

12

The question is whether they have rights

13

under State law.

14

to enforce the arbitration agreement to which they are

15

not parties, then they are entitled to a section 3 stay.

16

If they do have rights under State law

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I -- I don't see that the

17

-- that the section 3 stay follows from that.

18

very well be that in whatever ultimate forum the case is

19

thrashed out in that the -- that the nonsignatories will

20

be able to enforce the arbitration agreement.

21

It may

The question here is whether they can get a

22

stay in midstream in order to litigate that as a

23

separate issue.

24

should not, that the stay right should be limited to

25

signatories, is that the policy of the -- the Federal

And one argument for saying that they

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Arbitration Act is to enforce arbitration agreements.

2

It is not a policy simply to promote arbitration under

3

all possible circumstances.

4

contracts because the contracts, in effect, were being

5

given short shrift before the act was passed.

6

It is a policy to enforce

If the policy is one to enforce contracts

7

and, as Justice Ginsburg said, they had a chance to make

8

an arbitration agreement and they didn't do it, then

9

that is a good reason to say the Federal courts will not

10

stay the proceedings in midstream for somebody who

11

didn't get the agreement that that person could have

12

gotten.

What is your answer to that argument?

13

MR. BAKER:

Section 2, Your Honor, sets the

14

policy of the FAA, and section 2 establishes that State

15

law determines the rights and obligations of nonparties

16

to an arbitration agreement.

17

--

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If nonparties have rights

Including -- and -- and

19

you're saying that that covers, in effect, even a point

20

of Federal procedure as to whether you get, in practical

21

terms, an interlocutory appeal.

22

State law?

23

MR. BAKER:

That's a question of

Your Honor, that brings us to

24

the question of appellate jurisdiction, but first let me

25

deal with the merits.

Section 3, as this Court has
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

recognized on various occasions, is a procedural device

2

to enforce the substantive policy of section 2.

3

no substantive component on its own.

4

Section 2 establishes -- settles the

5

question of who may enforce or is bound by an

6

arbitration agreement.

7

directing a court to look to State law.

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

It has

It settles that question by
Section 3 is -

And the question here is:

What is the procedure to be followed in a Federal court

10

when there is disagreement about that?

11

that is a question of State law strikes me as a stretch.

12

MR. BAKER:

And to say that

Your Honor, section 3 is a

13

procedural device to enforce State law arbitration

14

rights.

15

thing.

16

Section -- likewise, section 4 is the same

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why do you say that section

17

2 -- it isn't at all clear to me that section 2 says

18

State law determines whether somebody not a party to the

19

arbitration agreement can -- can enforce it.

20

MR. BAKER:

Your Honor, that was the reading

21

of this Court in the Perry v. Thomas decision in 1987.

22

This Court construed section 2 as being a touchstone for

23

choice of law and that section 2 required the court

24

concerning questions concerning the enforceability of an

25

arbitration agreement to look to State law to answer
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

those questions.

2
3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Including enforceability by

whom?

4

MR. BAKER:

Absolutely.

That was the

5

precise question before the court in Perry and this

6

Court remanded to the California Court of Appeals to

7

determine whether nonsignatories to an arbitration

8

agreement could enforce that agreement.

9

Court of Appeals on remand held that they could under a

The California

10

theory of agency, which is indistinguishable in

11

principle from the theory that Petitioners are asserting

12

here today.

13

Respondents' theory, their interpretation of

14

the Federal Arbitration Act, would wipe out six decades

15

of FAA case law recognizing that nonparties have

16

enforcement rights.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do we have any

18

situation -- and this one is really peculiar because the

19

one party who has the arbitration agreement with

20

Carlisle is now out of it, and is not going to get back

21

in, because -- is it Bricolage -- is bankrupt, so there

22

is an automatic stay of any litigation against

23

Bricolage.

24
25

The one party that has the arbitration
agreement is out of the picture, so you have an
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

arbitration agreement effectively with no one, that two

2

parties who have no arbitration agreement are trying to

3

enforce:

4

litigation joining in an ongoing arbitration brought by

5

either party to the arbitration agreement, and relying

6

on an arbitration agreement effectively without two

7

parties to it.

8
9

The difference between parties to the

MR. BAKER:

Your Honor, the bankruptcy of

Bricolage has no effect whatsoever on our rights under

10

State law to enforce the agreement.

11

but -

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It is what it is,

But if you have a party

13

to the agreement who is no longer in the picture,

14

doesn't that change things?

15

MR. BAKER:

Well, the Respondents might -

16

might contend so, and they -- they are free to argue on

17

remand the question of whether or not that bankruptcy in

18

any way affects our rights, whether we can prevail under

19

equitable estoppel in this case.

20

this Court, the question that we -- that the Court has

21

to decide is whether or not as a matter of law a

22

nonparty is foreclosed from seeking relief under section

23

3, and section 3 does not foreclose such relief because

24

section 2 establishes the principle that this -- that a

25

court is to look to State law to determine the question

But for purposes of

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

of who can enforce an arbitration agreement.
So we're saying that Respondents' theory of

3

the case would wipe out 60 years of FAA case law

4

recognizing that nonparties have arbitration rights.

5

Theories such as third party beneficiary, assignment,

6

agency, estoppel, including equitable estoppel,

7

assumption, successor in interest, none of those cases

8

can survive effectively if this Court were to affirm the

9

decision of the Sixth Circuit.

10

I will now turn to section 16 and the

11

question of appellate jurisdiction.

12

the court below, erroneously conflate the merits of the

13

section 3 issue with appellate jurisdiction.

14

you reject their interpretation of section 3,

15

necessarily their appellate jurisdiction argument fails.

16

But that -- their theory of appellate jurisdiction

17

nevertheless should be rejected on its own merits.

18

Respondents, like

Thus if

Under section 16, and that's found at page 3

19

of the blue brief -- an appeal may be taken from an

20

order refusing a stay of any action under this title.

21

This establishes a broad category of orders that are

22

immediately appealable.

23

signatory test to determine whether it had appellate

24

jurisdiction.

25

the Respondents concede.

The Sixth Circuit below used a

Now, this test is legally erroneous, as
For 70 years -- should be 80
12

years -- the Federal Arbitration Act has been understood

2

not to contain a signatory requirement.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May -- may I ask you this?

4

Let's assume State law said we -- we don't recognize

5

stays at this stage of the game.

6

give a stay to anyone.

7

MR. BAKER:

Therefore, we will not

Would State law prevail?
Your Honor, State law controls

8

the question of who may enforce the agreement, who has

9

rights and obligations under the agreement.

Sections 3

10

and 4 control the question of whether relief is

11

available in Federal court.

12

enforce State law arbitration rights may vary from State

13

to Federal Court, but the principle of who -

The procedural devices to

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

That's what I'm getting at.

16

you in this case?

17

substantive rights under the agreement are issues of

18

State law, but the question before us is not one of

19

ultimate substantive right.

20

an -- an appellate process open to them and they can

21

assert those substantive rights if they didn't get them

22

at trial.

23

But isn't that the problem?
Isn't that the problem for

Because you keep arguing that their

At some point there will be

The issue here is not substantive right.

24

The issue here is a procedural right, and it's a

25

procedural right which depends upon the terms of the
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Federal statute, and that's why it seems to me that it

2

may very well be that the Federal statute determines not

3

only the procedural right, the stay, but who may ask for

4

it, that being a sensible Federal question rather than a

5

State question.

6

MR. BAKER:

Your Honor, the premise of your

7

question drives a wedge between section 2 and section 3

8

that is inconsistent with this Court's -- Court's

9

decision in Bernhardt.

This Court in Bernhardt said

10

that section 3 cannot be read apart from section 2.

11

Section -- this Court has never characterized section 3

12

or section 4 as containing any substantive elements.

13

Such -

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And your argument depends

15

upon, as Justice Scalia pointed out a moment ago,

16

reading section 2 as in effect incorporating State law

17

for purposes of determining substantive rights.

18

MR. BAKER:

It absolutely does.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, but that still begs

20

the question whether the -- whether the incorporation of

21

State law to determine substantive rights controls the

22

question of what law determines procedural rights, when

23

a Federal procedural right is claimed, which is what is

24

involved here.

25

MR. BAKER:

That's -- that's correct.
14

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sections -- it is a Federal question as to what sections

2

3 and 4 require.

3
4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

the answer to the Federal question is independent of it.

5

MR. BAKER:

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

And regardless of State law

That's not correct, Your Honor.
Then I'm -- I'm missing the

logic of your argument.

8

MR. BAKER:

The logic of the argument is

9

that section 3 and section 4, as this Court has said on

10

several occasions, are devices to enforce the principle

11

of arbitration enforceability outlined in section 2.

12

Section 2 establishes the substantive principle here.

13

Sections 3 and 4 are mere procedural devices.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Under -

But they are Federal

15

procedural devices and State law could not contradict

16

them.

17

what if State law said there could be no stay?

18

agree at that point that of course the Federal law would

19

prevail?

20

That's -- that's what we got into when I said

MR. BAKER:

You

That would apply to -- that

21

would apply to the question of the -- the action in that

22

court, but in the Federal court the threshold -

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It would apply to what the

24

judge is supposed to do at that moment when somebody

25

says, I want a stay.

And the judge at that point
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

consults Federal law, not State law, doesn't he?

2

MR. BAKER:

That -- on the procedural

3

question of what procedural mechanism -

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

5

question.

6

to State law or Federal law?

7

He says:

Well, just stick to my

I want a stay.

MR. BAKER:

Does the judge look

The judge first looks to the

8

question of who can enforce the agreement, and to ask

9

that -- to answer that question, the judge has to look

10
11

to State law.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Why is that necessarily so?

12

I don't understand your answer to that question, or your

13

statement that your argument is dependent on the

14

resolution of that choice of law issue.

15

Are the courts of appeals unanimous on the

16

question of whether the enforceability of an arbitration

17

agreement by a nonparty is a question of State law?

18

think there's at least a Fourth Circuit decision that

19

says it's a question of Federal law, but why -- why do

20

we have to decide that and why is your argument

21

dependent on it?

22

Suppose that is, suppose that were a

23

question of Federal law, what would that -- it might

24

change the ultimate outcome of whether there's an

25

entitlement to a stay, but I don't see why it has any
16
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

effect on a question of whether there is jurisdiction.

2

MR. BAKER:

I don't think it has any

3

question -- effect on the question of jurisdiction, Your

4

Honor.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Nor does it mean that you

6

necessarily cannot enforce the arbitration agreement,

7

does it?

8
9

MR. BAKER:

It means that -- well, you have

to look to a source of law to determine whether a

10

nonparty has rights under an arbitration agreement.

11

aware of that Fourth Circuit case.

12

believe that the court was incorrect.

13

Court's decisions in Perry and ensuing cases make it

14

clear that State law determines the rights and

15

obligations of nonparties to an arbitration agreement.

16

That's a settled principle.

17

question that has to be -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm

Your Honor, I
I believe this

And so that is a threshold

But if you read section

19

3, if you interpret, as you do, the word "parties" to

mean parties to the litigation, then for purposes of

21

jurisdiction the only thing is, is this person a party

22

to the litigation?

23

a stay.

24

this equitable estoppel theory which is determined by

25

the State law is a merits question.

Yes.

End of case; they can move for

Then whether they're entitled to one because of

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

You are making a more complex jurisdictional

2

argument than I understand.

3

simple argument that section 3 says parties; that means

4

parties to the litigation; the -- the Petitioners here

5

are parties to the litigation.

Therefore, they can move

6

for a stay of the arbitration.

And then we go to the

7

merits and say, do they have a good reason for staying

8

the arbitration?

9

What's wrong with the

But you're presenting a more complex

10

argument on the jurisdictional point which I don't quite

11

understand.

12

MR. BAKER:

Your Honor, I'm not sure I

13

understand the question.

14

jurisdiction or jurisdiction under the FAA?

15

Are you referring to appellate

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

First, is there

16

jurisdiction -- yes, appellate jurisdiction.

17

if there's an application to stay, is that appealable?

18

Why isn't -- why isn't the answer clearly yes?

19
20
21

MR. BAKER:
clearly yes.

If you -

The answer, Your Honor, is

If we're talking about -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But your step -- you seem

22

to be involving some merits question of State law in

23

that question.

24
25

MR. BAKER:

Your Honor, I turned to the

merits first because the Sixth Circuit below erroneously

conflated two entirely distinct concepts.

Well, I'll start

All right.

Suppose it's somebody who has interest in the litigation

18

but is not a party either to the arbitration agreement

or to the litigation?

20

MR. BAKER:

If a -- if a party -- if a

21

litigant makes a section 3 stay and they claim no right

22

to enforce the arbitration agreement, that denial of

that stay would be appealable, all right, because

I'm asking of somebody

who is not a litigant, who can -- if somebody who is an

2

interested spectator moves for a stay of litigation to

3

which that person is not a party, and the court says of

4

course not.

5

Would that be reviewable on appeal?
MR. BAKER:

No, because they -- the

6

spectator is not even a party, Your Honor, to the

7

litigation.

litigation seeking a stay.

Section 3 contemplates parties to the

9

On the question of appellate jurisdiction,

10

if a litigant makes a request for a section 3 stay and

11

the stay request is denied, there is clearly appellate

12

jurisdiction under section 16.

13
14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That is -- in our view.
That's your

jurisdictional argument.

15

MR. BAKER:

That's our jurisdictional

16

argument.

17

and the denial of that request triggers appellate

18

jurisdiction.

The mere request for relief under section 3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And you're saying that's

all that's before us because it was thrown out -

21

MR. BAKER:

That's not all that's before

22

you.

The Sixth Circuit below conflated the question of

23

whether there's appellate jurisdiction with whether non

24

signatories can seek relief under section 3.

25

it's essential for the Court to reach the second

That's why

Official - Subject to Final Review

questioned presented, which is whether non-signatories

2

as a matter of law are foreclosed from seeking relief

3

under section 3.

4

The court below -- I'll turn back to

5

appellate jurisdiction to -- Your Honor.

The court

6

below used a fact-based test; that is, is the party

7

seeking relief a signatory to the agreement?

8

that cannot be the law.

9

establishes that you don't have to be a signatory to

That -

Eighty years of FAA law

11

violates this Court's rule that you look to categories

12

of orders, rather than the facts of a given case in some

13

appellate jurisdictions.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

In addition, it

What are the instances in

15

which somebody who is not a signatory might seem to have

16

a right to enforce it?

17

he's a third-party beneficiary of the contract.

18

there others?

I can think of one.

MR. BAKER:

6

Well, estoppel, and there are -

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know what estoppel is in

the law.

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. BAKER:

More precisely, it's equitable

11

estoppel, but the -- the practice treatises have entire

12

chapters devoted to -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know, but I haven't

14

unfortunately had a chance to read all the practice

15

treatises.

16

is the theory of equitable estoppel that allows someone

17

who is not a signatory to an arbitration contract to

18

have it enforced?

19

So could you explain to me quite simply what

MR. BAKER:

Yes, Your Honor.

The theory

20

here is that the Respondents asserted claims of -- of

21

concerted misconduct, of conspiracy against the

22

Petitioners, some of whom were -- one of -- well, none

23

of whom were signatories to the arbitration agreement in

24

Bricolage which did -- was a signatory to the agreement,

25

that claim of concerted misconduct, in our view, where
22
Alderson Reporting Company

the Respondents are relying upon the agreement, that is

2

the agreement that they entered into with Bricolage to

3

-- is a theory upon which they are now seeking relief

4

from us.

5

contains the arbitration clause was an instrumentality

6

for the fraud that was perpetrated on them.

7

that they are now estopped from seeking, claiming that

8

they are not -- not obligated to arbitrate under the

9

agreement.

10

They are claiming that this contract that

sound intuitively sensible.

5

I mean, I guess there are -- there'd

MR. BAKER:

Well, Your Honor, we're not

6

saying that that applies in every case.

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

Oh, okay.

There's more That's all I

wanted to know is what's the theory in this case.

Boy, that

MR. BAKER:

The theory of equitable

estoppel.
JUSTICE BREYER:

If that's the theory, I -

12

unless I think it always applies, I could just say I

13

don't have to decide about a third-party beneficiary.

14

MR. BAKER:

Your Honor -

some other things.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I just have to decide
Now -- so you'd better say

Well, of course, one of -

Well, Your Honor, give me One of the things you're

22

going to say is that, with all due respect, Justice

23

Breyer, this conflates the merits with the

24

jurisdictional problem, which is exactly the mistake

25

that the court of appeals made.

Is that your theory of

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the case?

2

MR. BAKER:

Well, that's -- that's the first

3

error of the court of appeals, but the court of -- the

4

second error of the court of appeals was to decide -

5

was to hold as a matter of law that section 3 does not

6

allow nonparties to enforce an arbitration agreement.

7

The question of the merits of equitable

8

estoppel is not before this court, Your Honor, and it

9

may well be on remand in the Sixth Circuit that -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

I wouldn't have asked my

11

question if you hadn't said we have to go beyond the

12

question whether they had jurisdiction and answer the

13

merits, which is whether you can in fact enforce it.

14

MR. BAKER:

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

16

MR. De MARCO:

17
18

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Estoppel is what you invoke when you have no

19

contract to invoke, and this version of equitable

20

estoppel is what you invoke when you have no arbitration

21

agreement to invoke.

22

I want to come to a question that was just

23

asked by Justice Breyer.

Section 3 mandates only stays

24

in aid of contract-based arbitration obligations.

25

are not fungible, these arbitration agreements.

They
They

cannot just be picked up by anyone and advanced as a

ground for arbitration.

7

The FAA does not require

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I thought the first

issue -- I never got past the first issue.

8

MR. De MARCO:

Yes, sir.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the first issue was,

10

does he have a right to appeal?

11

and to me section 16 says yes.

12

was denied, and it says an appeal may be taken from an

13

order refusing a stay.

14

stay; he appealed.

15

And I read the statute,
He asked for a stay.

It

So there's an order refusing a

Why can't he appeal?

MR. De MARCO:

Because the stay that he

16

requested was distinctly outside section 3, not as a

17

merits question, but so far outside question -- section

18

3 that we can say he should not -- that the stay was not

19

requested under section 3; it was not denied under

20

section -

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there any -- is there

22

any other example in the law -- I can't think of one -

23

where you say this party has so silly an argument, which

24

is really what you're saying -

25

MR. De MARCO:

Right.

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- that we don't even let

him appeal.

3

MR. De MARCO:

Yes.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

There are -

It seems to me I've gotten

5

a lot of appeals where the appeal, I don't think, is too

6

meritorious, but nonetheless I never heard of saying you

7

can't appeal.

8
9

MR. De MARCO:

Right.

There are sort of

what I would call the Trojan Horse appeals, where a

10

party actually has moved to compel discovery and they

11

characterized it as an injunction.

12

denied, they said:

13

the right under 1292(a).

14

discovery motion; that's outside of the injunctive area.

16

When that was

An injunction was denied; we have
The court of appeals is
No, that's a

And here why we're saying this, Your Honor,

17

we recognize what they say about the Behrens case.

18

is an instance where we're asking the Court to, in a

19

sense, pull the veil on these section 3 -

that, I got your first point.

with it.

23

This

As to that, if you did
I understand it.

I agree

As to the second point, you say -- I was

24

surprised because I hadn't quite taken that in -- that

we are now supposed to reach what we would call the

merits of the appeal.

2

co-counsel say:

3

my equitable theory is good or not.

4

the treatises, I have; which is a fair comment.

5

and all I want you to say is that sometimes, at least, a

6

third party could enforce a contract to arbitration that

7

two others make.

8
9

Now, there you just heard your

Look, you don't have to decide whether
You haven't read

The statute doesn't say he can't.

And -

The

statute doesn't say he has to be the one who signed it.

10

And if you think of a third party beneficiary or an

11

assignment, for example, you would think, of course,

12

there are other people, say an assignee, who could

13

enforce it.

14

MR. De MARCO:

Right.

And there's a reason

15

why those -- in those cases, the third -- I will call

16

them nonparties were allowed to enforce.

17

that by saying not all of those were -- we've heard a

18

lot about State law and Federal law.

19

are tightly grounded in Federal law.

20

Let me preface

Not all of those

But take your example of the third party

21

beneficiary, they cite a case called J.P.

22

which the woman was incompetent, the agreement with the

23

nursing home was signed as -- on her behalf.

24

that's clear in that kind of case that the nonparty is

25

asserting the right through the contract, because of the

contract, dependent on the contract.

2

Here, by claiming equitable estoppel not

3

only aren't the Petitioners asserting rights that flow

4

to them from the contract, because they have no

5

contract; they are actually saying -- this is the gist,

6

it gets back to your question, what's the gist of their

7

equitable estoppel theory.

8

13:

9

Respondents from claiming that they have no obligation

It's as we quote in footnote

The gist of it is that equitable principles prevent

10

to arbitrate with the Petitioners despite the lack of an

11

agreement.

12

Their very theory assumes that what section

13

3 says must exist is absent.

14

don't have an agreement of our own to assert, and

therefore, we need equitable principles to fill the

void.

from?

Their very theory says we

Now, where do these equitable principles come

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then you might say that

19

they haven't stated a claim on which relief can be

20

granted, but that is the merits question.

21

supposed to be dealing with the question of whether the

22

denial of the stay -- there was a denial of a stay -- is

23

appealable under section 16.

24

question I don't think you get into how meritorious

25

their claim was for the stay.

We are

MR. De MARCO:

Your Honor, the fact that

2

they have filed a motion, and as I referred to it, the

3

concern that we have, and I think the concern that

4

animated DSMC and Universal when they took up this

5

issue, was the Trojan Horse stay motion.

6

keep in mind not every stay that is filed pending

7

arbitration, a stay pending arbitration is necessarily

8

filed under section 3, because in footnote 23 of Moses

9

H. Cone this Court recognized another kind of stay

10

pending arbitration, and that's a discretionary stay.

11
12

We have to

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

And what is the

criterion for identifying a section 3 stay?

13

MR. De MARCO:

The criterion, Your Honor, is

14

that the right to the stay must be -- the right to -

15

the statute speaks in terms of referable to arbitration

16

under an agreement.

17

arbitration" is the arbitration obligation.

18

that means dependent on, because of.

arbitrability of it depends on a written agreement.

20

What does that mean?

JUSTICE SOUTER:

"Referable to
"Under" in

So the

And your -- and your

21

position is that the statute should be so construed that

22

only a signatory to the written agreement has a right to

23

the stay, indeed has a right to request the stay under

24

article 3?

25

MR. De MARCO:

Yes.

JUSTICE SOUTER:
saying that?

3
4

What is your reason for

MR. De MARCO:

Just to clarify, the statute

being section 3.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

MR. De MARCO:

Yes.
Yes.

The reason for that is

7

this Court has been very clear in its interpretations of

8

the FAA in general.

9

said, requires -- does not require parties to arbitrate

The FAA in general, the Court has

10

when they have not agreed to do so.

11

standard.

12

that signatory, which didn't have an agreement with that

13

nonsignatory, to arbitrate.

14
15
16

So that sets the

If there is no agreement, you cannot force

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, what do you do with

third party beneficiary assignment assumption?
MR. De MARCO:

All of those examples,

17

Justice Kennedy, in all of those examples the right to

18

enforce the agreement, let's say the right to procure a

19

stay based on the agreement, flows from the intention of

20

the parties to the original agreement.

21

The examples they use -- assignment, they

22

cite a case where there is -- there was an express

23

assignment, and in the assignment the Court said they

24

actually assigned the agreement with the arbitration

25

clause in it to the successor.

They cite an assumption

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

case.

It was an express signed assumption.

2

all cases of contract-based arbitration.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Those are

Well, in a way that was

4

where one of the parties, without the other party's

5

consent, say assignee, a third party beneficiary.

6

in a way it's a fortiori because the party who is

7

objecting, his or its own actions caused the agreement

8

to come into play.

9

Here

That's their theory.

MR. De MARCO:

Well, let me tease that out a

10

bit.

11

this equitable estoppel that has developed as an ersatz

12

form of equity principle, it is not tied to section 3

13

nor is it tied to State law.

14

ad hoc, so it's an amorphous concept that we've seen

15

develop over the last -

16

The -- one of the -- the problems in this area,

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is -- it is perfectly

Your proper -- I see this

17

is actually a pretty difficult question to me, and -

18

because it seems to me sometimes they have to be able to

19

enforce it, the assignee, the third party beneficiary.

20

MR. De MARCO:

Right.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

And now what I don't know,

22

is what they're doing, it's true that section 3 and all

23

the other sections, they talk about the agreement, but

24

they don't say that the individual who is asking for the

25

stay has to be the same person who signed it, as they
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

couldn't.

2

possible people in the case who hasn't signed it should

3

and should not be able to enforce it?

4

So how do we know which among all the

Their argument is look to State law, okay?

5

And your argument is derive some principles yourself.

6

Really.

7

MR. De MARCO:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Right.
And so, so -- is it

possible to answer this case by saying he's wrong in

10

thinking you always look to State law.

It may depend on

11

what the State law says.

12

question.

13

and let the courts below work that out first, knowing

14

that the State law is relevant but not always

15

determinative.

16

case law on this and we'll be in a better position to

17

figure out what the right answer is.

18

MR. De MARCO:

So that's the answer to the

You should have had your appeal.

Go appeal,

Then we'll get some -- we'll get some

Justice Breyer, the question

19

of arbitrability does not always depend on State law.

20

In Volt, in first options this Court said sometimes it

21

does, but it does when the issue is, was a contract

22

formed, is a contract valid.

23

interpret that contract?

24
25

How are we going to

Here where equitable estoppel is concerned,
that's not the consideration.

Therefore, because you

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

can -- you can interpret the contract until the cows

2

come home, you're never going to find the Petitioners in

3

it.

So that the question -

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you see it's a little

5

hard.

I can imagine a case where they're sitting in the

6

room drawing up the contract, they put it in the

7

arbitration agreement.

8

directly related to the room.

9

and say, hey, we have arbitration here, I hope everybody

There are four other people
The parties look around

10

understands everybody is going to have to do this.

11

they all say, okay, don't worry about it.

12

And

Now, I would say, hey, maybe they're

13

estopped.

14

contract.

And there they're going right through the

15

MR. De MARCO:

Right.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I hate to write the

17

words "equitable estoppel is never relevant."

18

rather write the words "I'm uncertain State law is

19

relevant policy."

20

always relevant.

21

I would

You know, it's not true that it's

MR. De MARCO:

I think the safest ground is

22

to clear up first this question of how arbitrability is

23

decided.

24

Is -- is there unanimity among the courts of appeals.

25

The Fourth Circuit case that I -- I think

And I think Justice Alito asked the question:

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was mentioned, I believe that's the Bailey case.

2

don't even think there is unanimity, unfortunately,

3

within the Fifth Circuit.

4

better view, I think, that is expressed in the Fourth

5

Circuit case is that when the issue that's pivotal is

6

contract interpretation, arbitrability in that narrow

7

sense, that's State law.

8

law.

9

I

But there -- the -- the

When it's not, it's Federal

And I think that's why you see these

10

equitable estoppel cases not talking at all about State

11

law.

12

equity that's being -

It is sort of an ersatz, ad hoc version of Federal

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

Federal law be even simpler than that?

15

proposed one, and -- and probably because I don't

16

understand the law well enough, it may -- may have been

17

simply simplistic.

18

Okay.

Why shouldn't the
And I -- I

But my suggestion was the -- the issue

19

before us should be construed narrowly as being the

20

question of who can ask for a stay.

21

that would be only a person -- or one possible answer to

22

that would be only a person who has signed the

23

arbitration agreement, because the Federal policy is to

24

enforce agreements, not force arbitration.

25

therefore, it is sensible as a matter of Federal policy
36
Alderson Reporting Company

And the answer to

And,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to say, we're not going to stop this trial in mid-track

2

for arbitration unless you who are asking for it to be

3

stopped signed an arbitration agreement yourself, and

4

it's that agreement that you're trying to enforce.

5

Now, that is maybe a -- a too simplistic

6

approach, but tell me what's good or bad about that.

7

MR. De MARCO:

I think that it's the correct

8

approach to say that we are not talking generically

9

about the enforceability of arbitration agreements.

10

are talking in the context under section 3 of an

11

existing lawsuit.

12

stay this lawsuit.

So it is a different enforcement

to my simplistic theory.
MR. De MARCO:

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

Okay.

That opens the door

Now -

16

18

We

Yes.
-- is it a good theory or a

bad theory?
MR. De MARCO:

It's a good theory because

20

then, once you've opened that door to the -- the ability

21

to ask for a stay, you must ask:

22

ground rules for asking for this stay?

Well, what are the

23

And while my friend continuously returns to

24

State law, our point is you don't depart from the terms

25

of section 3 itself, because section 3 itself tells you
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the circumstances under which the mandatory stay

2

provision applies.

3

when it is referable to arbitration under a written

4

agreement.

5

And those circumstances are only

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

But it seems to me

6

that that's not enough, because "under the written

7

agreement" leaves open the question of whether the

8

written agreement can be enforced right here and now by

9

getting a stay only by somebody who signed it or by a

10

third party beneficiary or -- or somebody dependent on

11

the contract plus some other legal theory.

12

My simplistic suggestion was:

Keep it

13

simple and simply say the -- "under the agreement" means

14

an agreement signed by you, and the reason we confine it

15

to an agreement signed by you is not because the phrase

16

"under this agreement" tells us that.

17

leaves the question open.

18

It doesn't.

That

We say it is going to be confined to an

19

agreement signed by you because that's really the -- the

20

nub of the Federal policy.

21

agreements, and we want to confine this extraordinary

22

remedy of a stay to people who went to enough trouble to

23

make -- and I don't know whether that's a good idea or

24

not.

25

your interest to say it's a good idea, but I may be

We want to enforce

And -- I mean it's favorable to you, so it's in

getting into trouble by that.

2

you to tell me.

3

MR. De MARCO:

And that's what I want

Well, that's consistent with

4

the Federal policy as this Court has expressed that

5

Federal policy.

6

Federal policy is not a general policy to encourage this

7

form of dispute resolution but, rather, it is to give

8

effect to parties when and if they agree to arbitration.

9

So I agree that that is, and should be, the starting

It has -- it has said repeatedly the

10

point of the analysis.

11

expressed in -- in Mitsubishi this way:

12

the intent of the FAA is to give effect to arbitration

13

agreements, to put them on an equal footing with all

14

other agreements, but not more so.

15

-- what Petitioners are asking for is a "more so."

16

Is -- and -- and it was

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That -- that

And I believe what

Mr. De Marco, can I ask

17

you this question?

In section 3 do you agree with his

18

reading of the word "parties," or do you think "parties"

19

just means parties to the contract?

20

MR. De MARCO:

With my friend's reading?

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

22

MR. De MARCO:

Yes.

Justice Stevens, I have to be

23

honest and say I'm concerned about that argument because

24

I think Congress has used the word "parties" throughout

25

the FAA rather haphazardly to mean three different
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

things, maybe four:

Party to the agreement, party to

2

the action, party to the arbitration, or party-like

3

person.

4

on that.

5

used in sections 3, 4, 5, 9, I would be concerned about

6

-- about resting on that.

And I would be concerned about hanging it on -

7

So my -- my answer is, because of the way it's

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You are concerned about -

8

does that mean you agree with him that "parties" means

9

parties to the action and not parties to the contract?

10

MR. De MARCO:

I -- actually in section 3

11

what I would say is it's equivocal, and the rest of the

12

FAA doesn't help us understand that.

13

an issue on which I would not hang my hat, because it is

14

equivocal.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

So it's an -- it's

What would you think about

16

saying that some parties -- some parties to the case who

17

are not parties to the contract can as third parties,

18

nonetheless, enforce arbitration?

19

examples, assignees, et cetera.

20

whether this is one of them, judge, the key question -

21

we can tell you what the key question is and what it

22

isn't.

persons who did sign the contract.

We have listed a few
When considering

What it is has to do with the intent of the

MR. De MARCO:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Something related to that.

We don't have to be specific.

2

MR. De MARCO:

Right.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

What it isn't is a case

4

management device.

5

would be for the judge is to -- is to -- let's send them

6

all off to arbitration if we can, and then I would not

7

have to worry about this case for a while.

8

back, and I'll figure it out.

Because what I think the temptation

that?

And come

So is that -- is that

What's your insight or guess on

13

MR. De MARCO:

I think it's -- it's correct.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm just looking for ways

15

of separating these sheep from goats.

16

MR. De MARCO:

Yes.

The only way, I think,

17

to give effect to what the Court said, which is nobody

18

is going to be forced to arbitrate when they haven't

19

agreed to arbitrate, is for judges to take section 3

20

seriously when it is proffered as the basis for a stay

21

motion and to -- and to apply it as -

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You -- you just told us

23

that section 3 was ambiguous.

24

reference to "parties" means parties to the arbitration

25

agreement or parties in the litigation.

You don't know if the

41
Alderson Reporting Company

So how can we

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

take it -- we take it seriously, yes, and say there's an

2

ambiguity.

3

proper reference, parties to the agreement or parties to

4

the litigation.

5

We don't know from the text which is the

MR. De MARCO:

Justice Ginsburg, by

6

declining Justice Stevens's invitation of sorts to read

7

"parties" a particular way, I did not mean to -- to

8

suggest that the referable -- issue referable to

9

arbitration under a written agreement is ambiguous.

10
11

don't think that's ambiguous.
I think as applied here in this case it's

12

clear that the -- the Petitioners' claim of

13

arbitrability does not flow, to use Justice Breyer's

14

terms, from that which the parties to the Bricolage

15

agreement intended.

16

to that agreement intended for them to be covered, as

17

would be the case with a third-party beneficiary or -

18

I

They don't claim that the parties

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the "parties" in -- in

19

section 3 means parties to the arbitration agreement,

20

would that mean that a -- someone who is not a party to

21

the litigation could file a stay motion under section 3,

22

someone who is not a party to the litigation but is a

23

party to the arbitration agreement?

24
25

MR. De MARCO:

If it were limited to parties

to the -- if it were interpreted as parties to the
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

arbitration agreement, then it would suggest that a

2

party outside the litigation -- let's say a party that's

3

conducting an arbitration pursuant to an arbitration

4

agreement could intervene.

5

That's what happened in DSMC.

The -- the -

6

one of the contracting parties intervened and said, we

7

are engaged in this arbitration.

8

this, what had been claimed to be, nonarbitrable

9

litigation.

10
11

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. De MARCO:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

Well, once they intervene,

they are a party to the litigation as well.

12

14

We want you to stop

Pardon me?
Once they intervene they

are.
MR. De MARCO:

There I think it was for the

16

limited purpose of seeking a stay.

17

point, though, that -- I -- I think we have to be

18

careful in -- in judging the -- a stay motion, to focus

19

on the language of section 3 under the under-written

20

agreement language, and when -- when that is the focus,

21

I think it's clear that theories such as equitable

22

estoppel, an outlier among all those theories that were

23

listed, assumption, assignment -- an outlier among

24

them -- uniquely says that despite the lack of a written

25

agreement to arbitrate, equity requires; equity says it
43
Alderson Reporting Company

I -- I take your

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

should be arbitrated.

2

incompatible with the language of section 3.

3

That -- that I think is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you would recognize

4

that there is some appeal possibility, because you

5

already said or at least you said in your brief that the

6

12 might -- let's get this question settled about the

7

equitable estoppel and going to arbitration; That the

8

district court in its discretion that could give a

9

1292(b) order and say I want to get this issue settled

10

on appeal before I go on with the case.

11

MR. De MARCO:

Correct.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

MR. De MARCO:

That would be all right.

There is an appellate pathway

14

and that is 1292(b).

That has always existed for

15

discretionary stays.

I think it applies when a party

16

attempts, perhaps labels its motion a section 3 stay,

17

but misses the mark by not truly grounding it in

18

section 3.

19

their pathway to interlocutory appeal ought to be

20

1292(b), particularly because section 16(b) indicates

21

Congress felt that was a compatible accommodation in the

22

stay -- in the arbitration context.

23

When it misses the mark, their outlet -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well -- the district

24

judge could say, I'm going to treat this as a 1292(b)

25

issue, and I'm going to grant the stay so that the court
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of appeals can tell -- can tell me what the law is?

2

MR. De MARCO:

That's correct, Justice

3

Ginsburg.

I want to be clear that the rule we propose

4

as to these claimants asserting equitable estoppel does

5

not preclude them from seeking a stay, even based on

6

equitable estoppel.

7

is one in the D.C. Circuit, in the post-DSMC era.

8

There's a case called Toledano in which the party was

9

asserting exactly the same theory that -- that

And the best example I can give you

10

Petitioners are, equitable estoppel entitles us to a

11

stay.

12

come down and said you cannot under section 3 predicate

13

a stay on equitable estoppel, because you are by

14

definition saying I am not subject to a written

15

agreement; that's the predicate for section 3.

And what the court said there is well, DSMC has

16

So what the District Court said in that

17

State -- in that case, it entertained the stay as a

18

discretionary stay, and it granted it.

19

the very same ground that my friend is insisting should

20

be the ground for a mandatory stay in the post-DSMC era;

21

it's a basis in the District of Columbia for a

22

discretionary stay.

23

It granted it on

It worked exactly the same way.

The difference was you --

you were true to

24

the language of section 3 and you were true to the

25

language of section 16(a)(1)(A); you don't have the
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

runaway stays in the D.C. Circuit that you have in the

2

Fifth Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit and to some

3

extent in the Fourth Circuit; and you don't have the

4

interlocutory appeals from those except under 1292.

5

I want to come back to a -- to a question

6

that was -- that was asked by Justice Ginsburg about

7

Bricolage.

8

picture, or does the fact that Bricolage is out of the

9

picture make a difference?

10

If Bricolage were, let's say, back in the

The only sense in which an issue in this

11

case was ever referable to arbitration under an

12

agreement in writing is under the Bricolage agreement.

13

Once Bricolage departed the case, that obligation that

14

Respondents may have had to arbitrate with Bricolage

15

became inoperative, and what I see Petitioners

16

attempting to do is to disaggregate that the obligation

17

that Respondents undertook to arbitrate with Bricolage

18

from Bricolage's reciprocal obligation, detach it, and

19

run away with it as if it's a fungible commodity and say

20

we are now owed this obligation, when -- contrary to

21

everything this Court has ever said.

22

That's not the way the FAA works, because

23

with the FAA the starting point as this Court said in

24

Mitsubishi is did the parties agree to arbitrate that

25

dispute?

And if we're talking about the -- the absence
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of Bricolage, I think we're -- we're dealing with a case

2

where even among the equitable estoppel cases, this case

3

will turn out to be an outlier because of Bricolage's

4

absence.

5

I say that because we're also dealing with

6

accountants who were their accountants for 25 years

7

before Bricolage came along.

8

firm that had a written retention agreement, had a

9

contract with them and didn't think to put it in that

We're dealing with a law

10

contract, saying, "oh, pay no attention to that, let me

11

show you this contract that they signed with someone

12

else."

13

It gets back to Justice Breyer's point:

14

I -- let's say I unilaterally published in The

15

Washington Post, "I am through with litigation,

16

henceforth I will arbitrate every dispute with every

17

other human being that I get involved in."

18

section 3 agreement to arbitrate.

19

If

That's not a

Agreement imports the notion of an exchange

20

of arbitration obligations, which we do not have here.

21

Bricolage is gone.

22

of this equitable estoppel argument is the absence of a

23

-- of an agreement to arbitrate should be overlooked

24

because of equity.

25

There's no question that the premise

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Bricolage did move to

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

compel, it did move for a stay, did make a section 3

2

application; and then it -- it became bankrupt and got

3

the benefit of the automatic stay in bankruptcy.

4

MR. De MARCO:

Right.

MR. BAKER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Therefore there is

Respondents have made a very important
48

concession that decides this case.

that under section 3 nonparties can enforce an

arbitration agreement through the mechanism of section

3.

of whether on these facts, these nonparty Petitioners

7

can actually enforce section 3.

That decides this case.

9

Respondents concede

This case should be

The Petitioners' quarrel is with the
doctrine of equitable estoppel.

They don't like it, but

10

there's nothing in the text of section 3 that allows

various doctrines or legal theories that nonparties may

They just think that on the merits we don't
That's

2

not have any ability to assert this theory of equitable

4

or detached from the existence of a written arbitration

5

agreement.

6

So -- so it's not completely separated from

I would like to turn to Justice Souter's

7

signatory test for allowing relief under section 3.

8

With all respect, this defies 80 years of case law

9

interpreting the Federal Arbitration Act.

It defies the

10

history of the Federal Arbitration Act.

It's settled

11

that Congress in enacting this Act, chose New York law,

12

and the New York arbitration act lad a much more

13

stringent requirement for arbitrating existing disputes

14

which required a signature.

15

Congress, as we outlined in our brief, did

16

not choose that section of the New York law as a model

17

when it enacted the FAA in 1925.

18

appellate jurisdiction is illusory because that is

19

denied; a nonparty with arbitration rights be forced to

20

litigate and lose the very things that arbitration is

21

designed to avoid -- that is, the cost and time of being

22

in litigation in a district court.

23

District Court will suffer the loss of judicial

24

efficiency by having to litigate -- litigate a case

25

before it or adjudicate a case that should be in
