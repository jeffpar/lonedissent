ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH M. ROSENSTEIN

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11
12

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The State of Alaska fully recognizes the

13

importance of DNA evidence.

14

defendants with pretrial access to that evidence and it

15

has postconviction procedures that give prisoners a fair

16

opportunity to retest that evidence should new

17

technology become available.

18

The State provides criminal

So this case really isn't about the

19

importance or power of DNA evidence.

Rather it's about

20

three things:

21

device for asserting in Federal court a right to

22

postconviction testing.

23

device because Mr. Osborne's claim clearly sounds in

24

Federal habeas corpus.

25

singular relevance to support a direct attack on the

First, it's about the proper procedural

Section 1983 is not the correct

The evidence he seeks has a

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

validity of his confinement.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, he's -- he's not at

3

this point.

4

don't know -- he doesn't know presumably -- exactly what

5

that evidence is going to show.

6

to be exonerating and it may not be.

7

All he's doing is seeking evidence.

We

The evidence may prove

Until one knows the tendency of the

8

evidence, one can't say that we have a Preiser problem.

9

So if -- if we don't have that kind of a problem, then I

10

don't see -- I guess I don't follow your argument that

11

this necessarily sounds in habeas.

12

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Well, Your Honor, the --

13

Mr. Osborne's case is comparable to Balisok v. Edwards,

14

where the Petitioner was seeking damages for -- as a

15

result of a biased hearing in prison.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.

And if he was

17

seeking damages in this 1983 action for false

18

imprisonment or imprisonment under an invalid

19

conviction, I would understand your argument.

20

he is saying in effect is:

21

this evidence has to say.

22

damages, and it's not seeking release.

23

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

But what

I want process to know what
And that is not seeking

That's correct, Your Honor.

24

It's not seeking damages, but the proof -- the

25

difference between this case -- the only difference
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

between this case and Balisok is that in this case the

2

proof is going to be happening in a laboratory; whereas,

3

in Balisok the -

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

The difference -- the

5

difference is that if he succeeds in this case in

6

getting access to the evidence, that doesn't get him

7

outside or even in position to go outside the prison

8

door.

9

And what he does with that later, if he finds it

All it does is get him some evidence to test.

10

favorable, presumably is necessarily going to be in

11

habeas.

12

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

13

simply a discovery request.

14

away from his underlying claim of actual innocence, his

15

--

16

But this -- his request is
He's split his -- his claim

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, he's got to because

17

he doesn't know whether he has any evidence of actual

18

innocence at this point.

19

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

But he -- to assert a claim

20

of actual innocence, he doesn't need to have the result

21

of a DNA test, and -

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23

just says:

24

it has to say.

25

He's not asserting it.

He

I want to get to this evidence and see what

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

But the -- this evidence
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

has a singular relevance, and his -- his true intent is

2

to -- is to assert -

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

4

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

-- a claim of innocence.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

He has a singular objective

6

in getting the evidence, but we don't know what the

7

evidence means.

8

that he is guilty, for all we know.

9

The evidence may conclusively prove

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

That's true, Your Honor,

10

but what this represents, what his request represents,

11

is a discovery request.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it's a -- that's -

13

that's a fair way of putting it, but what he -- I think

14

ultimately his strongest argument or his -- his basic

15

argument is this evidence is potentially so important

16

that the State has no valid interest in keeping me at

17

least from seeing it; i.e., testing it.

18

call that discovery if you want to, but it's something

19

very different from the normal discovery that goes on as

20

an ancillary process to a criminal prosecution.

21

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

And you can

Well, the State does have

22

an interest in -- in insisting that Mr. Osborne follow

23

the established procedures.

25

Oh, that may be.

7

it's a lot less -- what should I say -- a lot less

plausible a constitutional claim.

9

that I'd like to look at; I'm not saying it will prove

That he has -- you know It may help me;

I don't know which, but I'd like to see

Is that the only claim he's making?

If so, it's -

There's some evidence

me innocent.

I'd just like to look at this evidence.

11

Might, might not.

12

had thought he was making, which is the claim that this

13

-- this new scientific evidence will -- will prove my

14

innocence.

That's a lot weaker claim than what I

15

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, which is he doing

17
18

here?

Is he saying the latter or not?
MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Well, he hasn't -- he has

21

which is at joint appendix -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it's not a

23

constitutional claim of entitlement to evidence which he

24

asserts will prove his innocence, but rather a

25

constitutional claim to evidence which might or then

for the other side.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, we're assuming the

premise, though, in the questioning.

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Well, as this case started,

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

I can't answer whether the

17

State has a policy.

18

made jointly with the police, the crime lab, and the

19

prosecutors, and it depends, I would think, on the

20

status of the case as it proceeds after conviction

21

through direct appeal.

22

It seems to be a decision that is

JUSTICE BREYER:

What now?

As far as I

23

understand, there's a procedural problem.

I tried to

24

figure out the Heck line once in Balisok.

My impression

of it is that if, Mr. Prisoner, you're bringing an

5

you get out of solitary or you get out of prison, then

6

you go to 1983.

7

are complaining about an action or inaction by a State

8

official that violates a constitutional right.

9

But if what

But, by the way, if you're in 1983 you

Now, as I look at this case the prisoner, if

10

he wins, is not going to get out, and he is complaining

11

about the State violating a constitutional right by

12

refusing to give him DNA.

13

question is the question that's the heart of the case:

14

Does the State have a constitutional obligation to give

15

him the DNA?

16
17
18

It seems to me that second

So I would appreciate your telling me why it
doesn't.
MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Justice Breyer, the State

19

doesn't have an obligation to provide this evidence to

20

him because there is no -- a -- prisoners have no

21

Federal right to postconviction relief, and the State of

22

Alaska has provided procedures by which -- which Mr.

23

Osborne if he chose to use them could make available the

24

evidence that he seeks.

25

those procedures.

But he hasn't chosen to invoke

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Justice Breyer.

Just to clarify his

6

statement, he said that the State of Alaska provides a

7

means for him to get at this information; but if it did,

8

I think we wouldn't be here.

9

one of the few States that has no statute.

10

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So would you -- Alaska is

That's correct.
So what -- you say -

12

this whole controversy is whether the State is obliged

13

to give him this information; but you're saying it's

14

simply that he picked the wrong procedure.

15

I thought I heard you say just now; that there is a

16

means under Alaska law where he could get this DNA

17

postconviction.

18

Alaska procedure is?

That's what

So would you please explain what the

19

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

20

Alaska has a postconviction relief statute

21

and that is at page -- starts at page 10a of the blue

22

brief.

23

claim for -- for postconviction relief when there exist

24

material facts -- I'm quoting from Alaska Statute

25

12.72.010.

And under that statute, a prisoner can assert a

Postconviction relief is available when a
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

person claims that there exists evidence of material

2

facts not previously presented and heard by the court

3

that requires vacation of the conviction or sentence in

4

the interest of justice.

5

Now, if Mr. Osborne were to state a

6

cognizable claim under that statute the Alaska rules of

7

court then apply the full civil rules pertaining to

8

discovery as of right to the applicant.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Has there been any case

10

in Alaska where a defendant postconviction was, in fact,

11

able to get DNA testing under the procedure you just

12

described?

13

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Well, Your Honor,

14

there's -- there was one case and it's cited in the

15

yellow brief, Patterson v. State, that a prisoner did

16

apply in court and was granted access to the DNA

17

evidence, but then it came to pass that the evidence had

18

been destroyed by that time.

19

So in that case the relief was granted, but

20

through the destruction of the evidence no testing was

21

possible.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you give me some idea

23

of how many cases there are in, say, the last 10 years

24

in which in State postconviction proceedings the

25

convicted prisoner has asked for DNA evidence?

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

I believe Three?

300?

Less -- we did an informal

4

search and found seven cases where there were actual

5

requests; and I believe that five of them involved court

6

cases, the one that I have just mentioned where the

7

relief was granted, and I believe the remaining are

8

pending decision.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, that relief

10

would require him to assert his innocence, wouldn't it?

11

He would have to bring a habeas corpus action claiming

12

that the State has no business holding him because in

fact he's innocent?

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I don't know that they're

22

arguing with you on that score.

What they are saying --

23

I think what they're saying, and this goes to a variety

24

of Justice Scalia's question, is that under the Alaska

25

statute in order to get to the evidence, or indeed in
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

order to make his -- his postconviction claim, he's got

2

to claim that the evidence of material fact requires

3

vacation of the conviction or sentence.

4

His argument is, I don't know whether it

5

requires it; because I haven't been able to test it.

6

What I want is to test it.

7

And as I understand it, under this

8

particular statute, he has no chance of doing so because

9

he can't tell you in advance what the test is going to

10

show.

Isn't that correct?

11

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Justice Souter -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, first tell me whether

13

that's correct or not.

He doesn't know what the test is

14

going to -- he doesn't know what the test is going to

15

show; so -

16

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

That is correct.

17

-- he cannot say that it

requires vacation of the conviction; isn't that correct?

it, and say, I am absolutely innocent.

problem existed that Justice Souter is -- is raising.

it?

25

The second is the Alaska court decision.

And the undergrowth first

16
Alderson Reporting Company

And my

Official - Subject to Final Review

impression is that Alaska refused the test because,

2

among other things, they couldn't say -- they said the

conviction rested primarily on eyewitness testimony, and

they have a bunch of reasons.

a matter of fact, tried to blow apart those reasons.

Suppose I agree with the Ninth Circuit.

Then my question is this:

Does the Constitution of the

defendant?

something we think which would be very difficult to do,

12

3600, which do require that perjury -- that perjury

statement to be made in order to -

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you think there's a

15

constitutional right to establish innocence in some

16

cases where there is new and -- evidence that could not

17

previously have been discovered, that has a high

18

likelihood of exonerating?

19

MR. KATYAL:

Well, this Court has struggled

20

with that and so far has said no.

21

position is Herrera v. Collins.

22
23
24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm asking for your

MR. KATYAL:

Our position is that the logic

of this Court's precedents is that there is no right at

present to actual innocence.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Katyal, the -- the

3

right that they're asserting may be located not in

4

procedural, but in substantive due process.

5

what I would like you to comment on is what the

6

government's or any government's interest, the United

7

States or that of a State, may be in, in effect, in

8

denying that there should be such a right.

9

What I -

And this question occurred to me when I was

10

going through the briefs:

11

Federal for your sake -- what if the United States had

12

imprisoned an individual who came forward and said:

13

Nobody realized it, but I was an eyewitness to the crime

14

for which X is -- is -- has been convicted and is

15

currently being incarcerated; and, in fact, I saw that

16

crime committed and he did not commit it.

17

arrives at this individual's prison and says:

18

talk to the guy.

19
20
21

What if -- we'll make this

X's lawyer
I want to

Would the United States have an interest in
saying, you cannot talk to him?
MR. KATYAL:

The United States wouldn't -

22

wouldn't have an interest as a -- would generally permit

23

as a matter of prosecutorial ethics access to -- if the

24

United States knew that there was some exculpatory

25

material that it had within its purview, it would turn
25

that over.

2

It just wouldn't be a constitutional JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, you know, prisoners

5

guy has some axe to grind.

6

We don't know whether in the

But the question is, would the United States

7

have any legitimate interest in saying to X's lawyer,

8

you can't even talk with him?

9

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I think that it would -

10

it would have to -- if it adopted such a rule and

11

allowed the talking in any situation -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MR. KATYAL:

14
15
16
17

Why wouldn't it?

Let me talk about DNA, for

example.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why do you need a rule, I

guess is what I'm saying.
MR. KATYAL:

Let me talk about DNA.

18

reason why with respect to DNA is it's a no-cost

19

proposition for a defendant to say:

20

I want to get tested -

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

22

MR. KATYAL:

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The

Hey, I'm innocent,

Oh, okay -

-- So that's why Are you starting with the

24

premise that the United States would not have a

25

legitimate interest in my hypothetical in saying, you
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

can't even talk to him?

2

MR. KATYAL:

Well, it depends on the

3

circumstances of the hypothetical and whether or not

4

there's some -- whether or not it would open up the

5

floodgates, I guess, to other requests and so on.

6

With respect to DNA, there is -

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, let's assume that if

8

you let this guy talk to -- X's lawyer talk to this guy,

9

other individuals may say, boy, I can have my moment in

10

the sun, too; I'm going to claim this.

11

assume the worst case there.

You know, let's

12

Would you still say, would the government

13

still say, we have an interest for that reason in not

14

even letting him talk to him?

15

MR. KATYAL:

It's possible, because there -

16

it may be that as a policy matter they will allow it.

17

But as a matter of constitutional law, Justice Souter,

18

this Court has repeatedly said -

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I haven't gotten to the

20

constitutional law yet.

21

whether there would be a legitimate interest in saying

22

no.

23

I just -- I just want to know

I mean, you can see MR. KATYAL:

Again, there may be because of

24

floodgates or other reasons.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But for the You mentioned the

27
Alderson Reporting Company

floodgates.

There are seven cases in this State in the

2

whole history of Alaska.

3

(Laughter.)

JUSTICE STEVENS:

5

Is that right?

That's

floodgates?

6

MR. KATYAL:

Seven thus far,

7

Justice Stevens.

8

constitutional right to DNA for all 50 States, there

9

would really be, I think, quite a dramatically different

10
11

If this Court were to recognize a

result.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Especially, I would assume,

12

one constitutional right in which you do not even have

13

to assert your innocence.

14

MR. KATYAL:

Precisely.

So we're talking

15

about seven in one State right now, but I think the

16

numbers could be great.

17

when they passed 3600, which said there has to be

18

something to lose on the stake of defendants, so that

19

they can't come in, like Mr. Osborne, and have

20

questionable statements as to whether they're actually

21

innocent or not.

22

That was what Congress said

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why can't you do this?

23

Look at the consensus of the statutes in the States and

24

the Federal Government and say there's a range of

25

appreciation here, and there is a right but it catches
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

only the outliers?

2

is that the outlying States would have to bring

3

themselves into conformity with the outer reaches of

4

whatever the set of statutes is now in all the other

5

States.

6

And so, the worst that would happen

MR. KATYAL:

Because, Justice Breyer, that's

7

not the way this Court approaches due process questions.

8

Were it, for example, non-unanimous jury verdicts, which

9

two States have, would be impermissible.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

instance in which there are outliers is

12

unconstitutional.

13

other reasons it might be unconstitutional; namely, you

14

have a good way of proving guilty or innocence, and if

15

that's so, the practical problem is not great.

16

solve the practical problem in the way I just mentioned.

17

I'm not saying every

I'm just saying in this instance for

MR. KATYAL:

You

But you enter the thicket of

18

practical problems, it seems to me, Justice Breyer, when

19

you do that, because the 44 States that have these

20

statutes do it in a variety of different ways with

21

respect to perjury requirements, felonies versus

22

misdemeanors, who gets access, who pays for it, do they

There's a host of policy questions that

So the constitutional right

is bring yourself within any one of them, unless that

2

any one of them is a real outlier, which you can make as

3

an argument that you will never win?

15

It is absolutely undisputed in this case

that there is a DNA test that Mr. Osborne seeks that

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, there was a

19

more reliable one at the time of trial as well, and his

counsel made the tactical decision not to use it

21

because, I assume, she was concerned it would show his

22

guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

MR. NEUFELD:

1

test I assume you are referring to, is not actually more

2

reliable.

3

didn't get used -- even the prosecutor didn't want to

4

use it as well, Mr. Chief Justice, because they felt

5

that the evidence was so degraded that if they tried

6

using that test there was a grave risk that it would

7

destroy all the evidence and not get any result.

8

that's why they chose that DQ alpha test, which is more

sensitive, albeit not as discriminating.

10

It's more discriminating.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the reason it

And

But what was the reason that

11

Respondent's counsel provided for not requesting that

test?

13

MR. NEUFELD:

Respondent's counsel said that

she was doing it for strategic reasons, although I think

it is quite important that Mr. Osborne at all points

said he wanted the testing, okay, and that his counsel

additional testing.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let's assume for the

sake of argument that there is some constitutional right

22

to obtain DNA evidence for testing postconviction.

23

Would you still -- would you say that that right

includes the situation where, A, the prisoner refuses to

25

assert under penalty of perjury that he or she is

decision at trial not to seek DNA testing at all or not

3

to seek the most reliable form of DNA testing that was

5

MR. NEUFELD:

Justice Alito, first of all,

he was never asked in this pleading to assert his actual

Indeed, Your Honor, to respond directly to

your question, to both of your questions, If this Court

21

decided, as Justice Scalia mentioned before as well,

22

that one requirement of this right is that a person

That is what the Innocence

if you go tomorrow and file a piece of paper and swear

7

on that piece of paper you're innocent, Alaska will give

8

you the DNA.

He said it, but I don't

isn't binding.

15

MR. NEUFELD:

Well, they took the same

position in the trial court in Alaska.

17

he is not entitled to DNA testing under the

requirement is not sufficient.

4

MR. NEUFELD:

5

need the swearing requirement, because he has previously

asserted his innocence; but what's most important

7

here -

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but the whole

point is that, Justice Ginsburg brought out the point,

10

that he hasn't asserted his innocence under oath.

11

there's no cost to him for asking for the DNA evidence.

12

If there's -- if we're writing up a new constitutional

13

right and we require as part of that that he assert his

14

innocence under perjury, and if he fails to do that,

15

he'll be prosecuted for perjury, that might at least put

16

some limitation on the number of people who can assert

17

the right.

18

articulated a materiality test for DNA testing; and they

said, like you're saying:

should be adopted as a matter of constitutional law.

position is, is that the test that they're calling for

You -- you were asked a

question earlier what it was in effect about the Alaska

frustrating.

18

the requirement to claim innocence was the problem,

although they did require that; but that the -- that the

real problem was that you not only had to claim

innocence; you had to be in a position to claim that the

You are correct; and

Justice Souter, they never ever said in -- in their

innocence.

that -- which is why the only rational test is the

Catch-22 or cart before the horse that you're referring

overwhelming than it was here.

the evidence to be very compelling evidence of guilt or

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You will see cases where

And you will see cases

where the defendant maintained that the defendant was

innocent.

Now, whether this was a requirement imposed

10

by Alaska or not, it seems to me you cannot point to the

practice of the other States and say Alaska must have

the same practice.

When, in fact, you don't comply with the

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Whether 1983 requires it

depends in part on whether we recognize a free-standing

right to test DNA evidence.

4

that sounds to me like substantive due process and

5

rightly so.

As I -- as I conceive it,

One condition for recognizing a substantive

due process right could be that the individual claiming

perjury one way or the other, either before the parole

just because he won't file a new piece of paper in which

accuracy does your constitutional right no longer apply?

9

MR. NEUFELD:

Well, the constitutional right

10

doesn't apply with a -- with a level of accuracy.

The

11

constitutional right applies in prohibiting the State

12

from arbitrarily preventing you access to the evidence.

13

There's a very compelling record -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, just so to

15

follow up on that -- so you -- if -- if the evidence

16

showed that there was -- would show that there was a one

out of two chance that your client was innocent, then

18

you think you still have a right -- a constitutional

19

right of access to that evidence?

20

MR. NEUFELD:

No.

I think the reason you

21

have it here, Your Honor, is that Alaska concedes -- I

powerful that if he gets a favorable result, it is

Well, I know it's slightly

outside the record, but just this week the National

what the limit of the constitutional right you're

22

asserting is.

23

MR. NEUFELD:

I'm trying to figure out

The limit is -- the limit is

24

-- it's the same limit, if you will, that the Innocence

25

Protection Act articulated and at least 41 of the States
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that passed acts have articulated, and by common law the

2

other States all gave DNA testing, the ones that didn't

3

have a statute, with the sole exception in the country

4

being Alaska, is if there's either a reasonable

5

probability that the DNA tests will -- that a favorable

6

DNA test result can prove innocence, okay, and you did

7

not -- you know -- that's the standard if you will,

8

okay, to get the test.

9

I would point out that I could understand

10

people having some disagreement about where that bar

11

should be in terms of how much proof of innocence the

12

test would provide.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

How can this constitutional

14

right be limited to DNA evidence?

I presume that there

15

are -- that there may be other scientific advances in

16

the testing of physical evidence, and if that happens,

17

why wouldn't the right apply to those as well?

18

in -- advances in detecting fingerprints or testing

19

fibers or all sorts of other things?

20

MR. NEUFELD:

Advances

Well, again, fibers didn't do

21

any better than fingerprints.

In fact, they did a lot

22

worse in the National Academy report issued last week.

23

I do think, however -- and I would hope that the day

24

comes that will be more truth machines like DNA, which

25

will make it easier for factfinders to have dispositive

to be very special.

7

But right now, there's

We'd like to give people -

JUSTICE ALITO:

I'd like to get back to the

8

second part of the question I asked at the start, which

9

you never really got a chance to answer:

Would it be

10

unconstitutional for a State to say that a -- a prisoner

11

can get postconviction access to DNA evidence, but not

12

where it appears that the prisoner is gaming the system?

13

Not where the prisoner declined at trial to ask for DNA

14

testing for a tactical reason because there was a chance

15

that the DNA evidence would be inculpatory?

16

be unconstitutional?

MR. NEUFELD:

Well, first of all, in this

18

case, that didn't happen.

counsel to the defendant.

MR. NEUFELD:

forwent the DNA testing because they JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But can we get an answer

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

to Justice Alito's question -- a hypothetical, the one

2

he put -- could you put that condition on a statute or a

3

rule consistently with the constitutional of the United

MR. NEUFELD:

you couch it in the loosest terms that Justice Alito

did, namely, "gaming the system."

don't want the DNA test; we'll shoot the dice; we're not

going to have the DNA test.

testing?

I still don't have the

I would say, yes, in

21

much the same way that the Innocence Protection Act says

22

if a defendant expressly and voluntarily waives on the

23

record a right to that DNA testing, which is so

24

fundamental because it goes right to the core of

25

everything, innocence versus guilt, then it would not be
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

unreasonable to prohibit him from having the DNA test.

2

But that was -

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

With the different questions asked, I have lost where

5

the answer is.

6

constitutional right if he forewent the test at trial,

7

or it is not?

9

You say it is still part of the

MR. NEUFELD:

What I'm saying is it would

not be an unconstitutional restriction like the

10

Innocence Protection Act if the State of Alaska required

11

-- which it does not now because there is no legislative

12

scheme but in the future required -- that the -- a

13

defendant who doesn't want DNA testing has to

14

voluntarily and explicitly waive that on the record.

15

That -- the voluntary and knowing waiver is a

16

requirement in the IPA, and if -- if Alaska did

17

something like that, I think that would be -- that would

18

not be irrational.

19

However, I must point out in all honesty

20

that there are a number of people who are mentioned in

21

the exonerating briefs such as Eduardo Velasquez and Mr.

Tony, whose lawyers did just that.

MR. NEUFELD:

You have to

10

appreciate that at this point in time, when there's a

11

discussion about, you know, what a prize -- and it is

12

our position that this action ends, if you will, okay,

13

and the Court grants him access to the evidence under

14

1983.

15

And as was pointed out earlier during the

necessarily hold out that much reliability for that

either, Justice Roberts.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's a good point.

8

What -- how long under the Constitution does the State

9

have to retain this evidence?

10

MR. NEUFELD:

Under the Constitution there

11

is no duty under current law to preserve the evidence.

12

We -

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Would that be a

corollary of the constitutional right you are asking for

somebody else specifically says, I want to do DNA

procedure in whatever court to commence that action, and

then, and only then, the other side goes out and

destroys the res that is the subject of that litigation.

At that point I think that would be in bad faith.

I am just wondering if there

would be any objection to an absolute rule that says

what:

After two years, after one year of conviction?

4

MR. NEUFELD:

No -- no objection.

But on a

5

practical level again, what we're seeing is that States

6

all over the country want to preserve this evidence, not

7

just for the wrongful conviction cases but also to

8

enable detectives who are working cold cases to have

access to evidence.

10

And if the evidence isn't there any more,

11

they can't work them.

So we're seeing a movement across

one point.

MR. NEUFELD:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I take it he is not now in

MR. NEUFELD:

I believe he is in custody -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

MR. NEUFELD:

Not for this offense?

Well, I -- I think what

21

happened is -- and I -- and I -- I can't swear to this

22

-- is -- is that he was -- he got a conditional release

23

on the other matter.

24

was violated as well.

25

And then the conditional release

MR. NEUFELD:

That's right.
But he's not now in

custody for this offense.

5

MR. NEUFELD:

He's -- he's not, but I don't

think that would make a difference in the outcome.

7

Certainly, if a person had a death warrant in one State

and then they were charged in another State, they would

still have a liberty interest in the outcome of that

other case.

MR. NEUFELD:

Was he released on

I -- I believe he -- he was

14

released on what's called conditional release.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

And was his

confession a necessary predicate to that release?

17

MR. NEUFELD:

Well, under Alaska law one of

the key requirements to get parole is that you accept

responsibility for the crime.

that he was given six more years to serve on the -- on

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH M. ROSENSTEIN

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I -- before you start,

5

would you -- I want you to clear up the question that

6

Justice Breyer asked.

7

make the declaration under perjury that he's innocent.

8

I understood you to say that would enable him get

9

discovery, not necessarily to say he would get the DNA

10

evidence.

11

Assume on remand he would now

Am I right?
MR. ROSENSTEIN:

If he were to file a new

12

application for postconviction relief with an affidavit

13

that the civil rules of discovery would apply, and he, I

14

believe, would be -- be able to obtain the evidence that

15

he seeks.

However -

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18
19

How about Would you resist that

request?
MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Well, there are -- there

20

are possibilities of procedural default.

21

that would be for the court -

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right.

And

You cannot confirm that

23

you would acquiesce and recommend that he get the DNA

24

sample under those conditions?

25

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

I -- yes.

62
Alderson Reporting Company

I -- I believe I

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

could.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you would still want

3

to leave yourself open to make the objection that he had

4

a chance to get this at trial and -- and -- and decided

5

not to get it.

6

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

As I say -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wouldn't those objections

8

continue to apply?

9

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

I'm -

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, it -- it seems to

11

me that -- that all -- all that you have to concede is

12

that there is some means for him to get into court, with

13

those -- those exceptions that other States make; and

14

other States make an exception for gaming the system.

15

So, so long as he can get in in habeas corpus it seems

16

to me you can very well leave for later whether you are

17

going to concede that even though -- even though he

18

didn't ask for it at trial, he can get it now.

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

That's true, Your Honor.

Right.
Once those were cleared

away then he would be able to -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the net result is that

15

it is perfectly clear to me from the argument that you

have not conceded that if he now files the paper, he

will definitely get the DNA.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I want to clear up But you -- you referred

23

to the civil rules, and in discovery, in criminal cases

24

as in civil cases, it -- ordinarily you have to prove

25

that you have a basis for a claim.
64
Alderson Reporting Company

Like you don't get

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

on the civil side discovery before you can pass the

2

12(b)(6) threshold that you have stated a claim.

3

Are you giving that up here?

Because he's

4

seeking the discovery but he hasn't established that he

5

has a tenable claim.

6

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Justice Ginsburg, Mr.

7

Osborne by filing an affidavit that would accompany his

8

application, that would -- I think that would operate to

9

state a claim.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would there be instances

11

when you, as the Attorney General of Alaska, would waive

12

procedural defaults, in order to determine if there was

13

guilt or innocence in a case where DNA conclusively

14

proved it, simply pause of your interest in not

15

confining innocent people?

16

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

That -- that's conceivable,

17

Your Honor; but in -- in Mr. Osborne's case, he's had 14

18

years to step forward and declare his innocence as any

19

truly innocent -

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All you're can say in

21

answer to my question is, to your particular approach to

22

your duties here, is that that's conceivable?

23

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

It is.

24

Because I don't think that the mere existence of the

25

possibility that DNA could exonerate is necessarily
65
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sufficient -- a sufficient basis to then do the testing.

2
3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

This is where I -

look.

4

He files a new piece of paper.

Now, if

5

you're going to oppose that, on the ground that it

6

wasn't procedurally correct, one; on the ground, two, he

7

didn't ask for this DNA at trial, though he might have

8

met with the charge, what was at issue at trial is

9

something very different; three, that he wasn't

10

guilty -- you know, too much evidence against him, met

11

with the claim, there wasn't much evidence against

12

him -- okay, we have the case in front of us; we'll

13

decide it.

14

But if you're prepared to concede "I'm not

15

going to raise those things," then their client has what

16

he wants -- the DNA.
