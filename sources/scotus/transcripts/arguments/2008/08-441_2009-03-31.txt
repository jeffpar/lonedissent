Mr. Schnapper.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The court of appeals erred in holding that

12

the plaintiff had to have direct evidence in order to

13

obtain the specific instruction at issue in this case.

14

This Court's decision in Desert Palace makes

15

two important points that are relevant today.

16

the Court noted that this Court had at no time imposed a

17

direct evidence requirement without an affirmative

18

directive from Congress to do so.

19

noted that Congress, when it wished to impose heightened

20

standards, had done -

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

First,

Secondly, the Court

Excuse me.

That -- that

22

statement may be wrong depending upon how you read Price

23

Waterhouse, might it not?

24

we've never imposed such a requirement.

25

think Justice O'Connor's opinion was the determinative

The first statement, that

3
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, if you

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

opinion in Price Waterhouse, then -- then we had.

2

MR. SCHNAPPER:

3

Honor.

4

Palace.

5

regard.

That was not the view of the Court in Desert
Desert Palace may have misspoken in that

6
7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It was dictum.

They may

have been wrong.

8
9

That -- that's true, Your

MR. SCHNAPPER:
think they are right.

Well, we -- we'd like to

I mean, we think they are right.

10

But of course, as you say, that is, in a sense, one of

11

the questions before us.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but -- I just want

13

-- you said that the Court has never imposed a burden of

14

proof-shifting requirement absent a directive from

15

Congress?

Are you -

16

MR. SCHNAPPER:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

No.

I -

Or maybe -- maybe I

misheard.

19

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, I may have misspoken,

20

Your Honor.

What the Court said was that this Court had

21

never imposed a direct evidence requirement -

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

MR. SCHNAPPER:

24
25

All right.
-- in the absence of an

affirmative directive from Congress.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
4
Alderson Reporting Company

There is some

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

disagreement among the parties, of course, what "direct

2

evidence" means, whether it means direct as opposed to

3

circumstantial, or direct in the terms that for example

4

Judge Collatin put it in the decision below.

5

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Your Honor, there is not a

6

difference between the parties.

7

that.

8
9
10

We take no position on

There is a considerable variety of views about CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

us we never required direct evidence, but you are not
taking a position on what direct evidence is?

11

MR. SCHNAPPER:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

right or you may be wrong.

14

what we're dealing with.

15

So you are telling

MR. SCHNAPPER:

The I mean, you may be

But we kind of have to know

Yes, the Court hasn't put

16

those two things together in the way you did.

I think

17

that's fair.

18

didn't define direct evidence.

19

clear in that sense exactly what the Court meant.

20

think it's fair to say it certainly meant that the Court

21

hadn't required direct evidence in the sense of

22

non-circumstantial evidence, but -

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The Court's statement in Desert Palace
It's not -- it's not
I

Well, in your

24

petition, you asked -- you used the phrase "direct

25

evidence," and I just want to know in what sense you
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

mean that?

2

MR. SCHNAPPER:

We -- it's our view that no

3

special evidence is required to get the instruction in

4

this case.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there a variety of

6

views among the circuits on what Justice O'Connor meant

7

by the term "direct evidence"?

8

Price Waterhouse either.

9

MR. SCHNAPPER:

10

It wasn't defined in

No, it was not, Your Honor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So there is a range of

11

views on what it means, starting from direct versus

12

circumstantial, to something like strong evidence.

13

MR. SCHNAPPER:

There is a range of views on

14

that, but our view is the burden on the plaintiff is to

15

show by a preponderance of the evidence that in this

16

case age was a motivating factor, but it's not required

17

to show it by any particular kind of evidence or to show

18

it by strong evidence as opposed to merely evidence

19

sufficient to establish that by a preponderance of the

20

evidence.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Price Waterhouse was a bench

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Yes.

trial, wasn't it?
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SCHNAPPER:

I believe so, yes.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, would the -- if there

3

is a direct evidence requirement, it may arguably cause

4

a great deal of problem when the trial judge has to give

5

an instruction to the jury, because then the -- the jury

6

will first have to decide whether a particular type of

7

evidence is present in the case before it can tell

8

what -- who has the burden of proof and what the

9

standard is, but if Price Waterhouse is understood

10

simply as a way for a judge conducting a bench trial to

11

look at the evidence, does it present any of the

12

problems that have been identified with the Price

13

Waterhouse -- that interpretation of Price Waterhouse as

14

applied to jury trials?

15

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, it wouldn't present

16

the same -- there are special problems applying it to

17

jury trials.

18

evidence is simply wrong for a number of reasons.

19

the least, the Court would have to finally resolve what

20

direct evidence means in this particular context.

21

We think that the requirement of direct

JUSTICE ALITO:

At

Well, if it's just an

22

instruction to a judge conducting a bench trial, it

23

could mean that if the judge sitting as the trier of

24

fact finds that there is direct evidence, strong

25

evidence supporting the plaintiff's claim, then the
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judge will need to have strong evidence, stronger

2

evidence on the other side in order to rule against the

3

plaintiff.

4

work out in that situation.

5
6

It's not hard to figure out how it might

The problem comes when it has to be posed in
the form of a jury instruction.

7

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, it's a particularly

8

serious problem there, but if you were to announce this

9

as a rule, you would -- I think the time has come to

10

explain definitively what "direct evidence" means.

11

courts of appeals are in wide disagreement about that,

But Desert Palace was a

Title VII case, wasn't it, under the 1991 amendment to
Title VII?

11

MR. SCHNAPPER:

It was.

But that part of

12

the reasoning of the case is not based on the language

13

of Title VII other than the absence from Title VII of

that specific language.

heavily against the Court's inferring, and that part of

But your -- your position,

you rest heavily on the argument, I think, but there is

no textual support in the ADEA for a heightened evidence

25

isn't it true there is no textural support for shifting
9
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the burden of proof at all?

2

you can -- can convince us of the first proposition

3

without confronting the second.

4

MR. SCHNAPPER:

I mean, I don't see how

Well, this Court has on a

5

number of occasions allocated the burden of proof among

6

the parties, including to a defendant, without a

7

specific textual basis.

8

in Burlington Industries v. Eller, where the Court's

9

opinion places on the defendant the burden of

The Court did so, for example,

10

establishing an affirmative defense in certain types of

11

sexual harassment cases.

12

for that.

13

There wasn't a textual basis

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, of course,

14

affirmative defenses, usually the burden of persuasion

15

is on the party asserting the affirmative defense.

16

MR. SCHNAPPER:

In Justice -- in the case of

17

Price Waterhouse, Justice White characterized this

18

allocation as the burden, as an affirmative defense.

19

But this sort of thing routinely with regard to the

20

allocation of burdens.

21

with regard to heightened evidence requirement.

22

It does not happen routinely

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I take it the only issue

23

that you have raised before us is whether the evidence

24

that does raise a burden on the defendant's part has got

25

to be, whatever this means, direct or not?
10
Alderson Reporting Company

That's the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

only issue?

2
3
4

MR. SCHNAPPER:

That's the only issue before

the JUSTICE SOUTER:

Am I right that the only

5

source of argument for the proposition that it does have

6

to be direct evidence is Justice O'Connor's opinion,

7

separate opinion?

8
9
10
11

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, that has been the

primary basis for the argument in the courts below.

I

think Respondent has other arguments as well.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

There are arguments about

12

the need for substantial evidence.

13

direct evidence goes back to the separate O'Connor --

14

O'Connor opinion.

15

MR. SCHNAPPER:

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the argument for

That's certainly the origin.
And are you -- I mean,

17

we're going to hear about this.

18

an argument to the effect that that should not be

19

regarded as the controlling opinion, and if that is the

20

source of it, that is the end of the issue.

21

going to get into that?

22

Are you going to make

Are you

Well, I would be happy -- I

would be happy to get into it, Your Honor.

I think you should.
As -- as Justice Ginsburg

pointed out, there are -- there were actually six

2

members of the Court in Price Waterhouse who concurred

in the result.

requirement and said there were no limit on the type of

6

evidence that could be used.

Justice White said that the plaintiff's

burden was to show that in that case gender was a

9

substantial factor.

10

He didn't say substantial evidence

was required.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

As I understand the White

12

opinion, it had nothing to do with the character of the

13

evidence.

14

persuasiveness of the evidence; is that correct?

15
16

It had to do with the degree of

With due respect, no, Your

It had to do JUSTICE SOUTER:

18

what "substantial" means.

19

that?

20

Then I don't understand
What do you think he meant by

MR. SCHNAPPER:

The "substantial factor" was

21

somewhere on the scale of a very unimportant factor or a

22

very, very important factor, which is separate from how

23

clear the evidence was that it was a small or large

24

factor.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In your response to

2

Justice Souter's question you said you're only focusing

3

on the direct evidence threshold.

4

evidence is the threshold to give you the benefit of

5

shifting the burden of persuasion of the employer, is it

6

really fair for you to be able to say, we are only going

to take out one side of the behalf, we are going to

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, the -- the Price

13

Waterhouse plurality and Justice White didn't see two

14

aspects.

15

of the evidence that in the case gender was a motivating

16

factor, and for five members of the Court that was

sufficient.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I understand the

21

difficulty of figuring out who is controlling in -- in

22

Price Waterhouse.

23

my understanding -- I understand it has been applied in

24

different ways.

25

when they say "the Price Waterhouse approach," which is

But at least as it has been applied,

My understanding of what people mean

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that there is a higher showing of evidence, direct

2

evidence, whatever -- people don't agree on what that

3

means.

4

persuasion shifts to the employer on the issue of

5

causation.

6

But if you meet that showing, then the burden of

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Your Honor, that is

7

precisely the issue on which the lower courts have been

8

divided.

9

and have taken the view that there is no special

Some courts have expressly rejected that view

10

heightened standard of any kind.

11

that it is required.

12

Other courts think

That is what we are -- what -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, Mr. Schnapper, there

13

is a difference -- and I think it's critical to your

14

case -- between what is called the prima facia case that

15

the plaintiff would make under the McDonnell Douglas

16

test and proving by a preponderance of the evidence that

17

in this case age discrimination was a motivating factor.

18

I think you must concede that in order to fit within

19

this double motive frame you must show not simply a

20

prima facia case, but by a preponderance of the evidence

21

that the discriminatory factor was a motivating factor.

22

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Yes.

We -- we are obligated

23

to do that, and the -- the defendant has argued below

24

and would, I think, on remand still be in a position to

25

argue that we didn't have enough evidence to meet that
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

burden.

2

But that question isn't before us.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can -- can one know if

3

you've met that burden before the case goes to the jury?

4

That is, when -- when the case starts out, it's unknown

5

whether you have established by a preponderance of the

6

evidence that age discrimination was a motivating

7

factor.

8
9

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, whether there is

sufficient evidence is often tested by a motion for

10

summary judgment.

11

that issue, before trial.

12

before trial -- and -- and frankly is often known only

13

to the jury -- is whether the jury will conclude that

14

the defendant acted with two motives or one motive.

15

That -- that isn't something you would normally be able

16

to -- to resolve before the case went to trial or even

17

during the course of the trial.

18

So courts do look at that matter,
What -- what isn't knowable

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, correct me if I am

19

wrong.

I assume that in a jury case that simply was

20

left to the jury, and the instructions would be

21

something like this:

22

shown that age was a motivating factor, then you look to

23

the next question.

24

shown that he would have fired the plaintiff anyway?

25

Isn't that the way it works?

If you find that the plaintiff has

And that is:

MR. SCHNAPPER:

That's the -- that's the way

it works.

that is the way it works in -- in a Title VII case

Yes, that's the way it works.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's

Well, in -- in response

8

further to Justice Ginsburg's question, and I think

9

Justice Souter's, too, is there -- are there any

10

tactical difficulties or strategic difficulties that

11

counsel face if they don't quite know which way the

12

burden is going to shift before trial:

13

number of witnesses you have waiting in the hallway or

14

-- this -- this would be after summary judgment.

15

MR. SCHNAPPER:

18

their differing instructions a week before trial, the

19

instructions were resolved at the end of trial.

that happens all the time.

What happened here in terms of jury

That -

Sometimes if the parties don't know how the

their tactics, but that happens every day in trials.

That -- that was the

basis for their reversing and remanding.

14

that it would have reached the same" -- "in the absence

the judgment reversing this case in part and remanding.

With respect to the employer's burden, however, the

20

objective evidence."

21

Rather than merely requiring

And he disagreed with that.

MR. SCHNAPPER:

All right.

There -- there

were a number of different issues in the case.

23

first, the court of appeals had held that when the

burden is on the employer to show it would have made the

17

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

burden with clear and convincing evidence.

2
3

The plurality and Justice White, the whole
court rejected that.

4

Secondly, the plurality suggested that the

5

employer in response would have to have objective

6

evidence.

7

evidence standard has not been followed by the lower

8

courts in -- in the wake of that.

9

Justice White rejected that and the objective

The third question was whether the burden

10

should be placed on the employer.

On that issue the

Court was divided six to three.

-- is do you need any kind of evidentiary special

15

showing to get to a mixed motive; and, if so, is it non

16

circumstantial evidence or evidence that directly ties

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

It is the

Could I ask you this?

Do

19

you think that there is a tenable distinction between a

20

mixed motives case and a non-mixed motives case?

21

every employment discrimination case that gets beyond

22

summary judgment, aren't there mixed motives at play?

23

MS. BLATT:

In

I think there is a lot to be

24

said for that argument, and this is a very difficult and

25

unsettled question under Title VII.
19
Alderson Reporting Company

I think what would

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

be on the table if this Court ever had an appropriate

2

vehicle -- and this certainly is not the appropriate

3

vehicle to get into this question -- there would be

4

several options on the table.

5

view suggests, which is after summary judgment you could

6

get a motivated factor instruction that the jury would

7

be permitted to find both impermissible and permissible

8

motives.

9

You could have what your

You could also have a special verdict form

10

that asks the jury:

Do you find that there were two

11

causes, one of which was an impermissible factor?

12

you could have a situation which I think prevails in

13

trial courts now -- and it has been the EEOC's practice

14

-- which is -- and it's not the most analytically clean,

15

but they basically give the instruction, either a

16

determinative cause or motivating factor instruction, on

17

what they think best fits the evidence.

And

18

And I think it's important for the Court to

19

understand, as we -- the law exists now under Title VII

20

and under all the other anti-discrimination acts, there

21

are two regimes out there.

22

regime and a determining factor regime.

23
24
25

There is a mixed motive

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Couldn't -- couldn't any

Title VII case be presented in either framework?
MS. BLATT:

Yes.

But this is -- I will also

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

give you, which I think is important especially when you

2

write your opinion, the three reasons why you should not

3

resolve this very difficult question in this case.

4

the first is that it wasn't pressed or passed on below

5

or raised in the brief in opposition and did not receive

6

full briefing by the parties and all the amici.

7

And, second, just as you left this issue

8

open in footnote 1 of your opinion in Desert Palace,

9

Judge Collatin writing for the court recognized this

And

10

precise issue in footnote 3 of the court's opinion on

11

petition appendix page 12, saying:

12

direct evidence requirement, we are going to have to

13

figure out when is it appropriate to give a motivating

14

factor instruction, absent the -- the language,

15

expressed language in Title VII?

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

MS. BLATT:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Assuming there is no

Why don't you -

The third reason I will let you get

19

your third reason in in a minute, but why -- do you

20

really think it's fair to pick one part of a complicated

21

test that the court has constructed and say, well, this

22

one doesn't make any sense, and pull it out?

23

maybe it only makes sense in the context of the whole

24

construct, or maybe none of the elements actually make

25

sense.

I mean,

But it seems to me very artificial to focus on
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

one aspect and say, let's fix this, without assessing

2

what its impact is on the rest of the text.

3

MS. BLATT:

I see your point, even though

4

that is exactly what you did in Desert Palace.

But

5

Price Waterhouse is a two-decade-old decision.

We're 20

6

years past that and it has been essentially codified in

7

Title VII.

8

"fix this" under the Age Act, every -- the bulk of the

9

discrimination cases fall under Title VII, and a

So no matter what you do to, quote unquote,

10

motivating factor instruction is codified, and you

11

unanimously held in Desert Palace there is no special

12

evidentiary requirement.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That was -- that was

14

because -- that was because of the 1991 Act which

15

addressed Title VII and quite deliberately left ADEA

16

out.

17

MS. BLATT:

Unless you overrule Price

18

Waterhouse, which would be an upheaval in the law, and

19

certainly -- this wouldn't be the appropriate case to do

20

it, all the courts of appeals have unanimously held

21

under the Age Act and under a wide variety of State

22

statutes and other Federal discrimination statutes that

23

the Price Waterhouse burden-shifting framework applies.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You are asking us to

overrule the aspect of Price Waterhouse involving direct
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

evidence, at least if you look at Justice O'Connor's

2

opinion.

3

MS. BLATT:

I don't think you need to decide

4

that question.

5

said, well, there is language in our opinion that may

6

have been confusing or it's not clear what the holding

7

is, but we henceforth are going to clarify, here's what

8

the law is.

9

In a lot of other contexts, you have

You did it in the recent crack cocaine case

10

in Spears, you did it in your nude dancing case, and you

11

did it in a case called Jefferson v. City of Tarrant

12

County, an opinion Justice Ginsburg authored, that you

13

said:

14

cases make clear, and there is lots of reasons why you

15

would not impose a direct evidence requirement, however

16

you define that term.

17

Well, there is language here that substantive

Since Desert Palace, there is a decision of

18

Sprint/United v. Mendelsohn.

And I think that case a

19

fortiori forecloses all the arguments made by the other

20

side that, well, even if it doesn't mean

21

non-circumstantial evidence, it must mean something that

22

is highly relevant to the issue of discrimination.

23

Sprint/United you said we're not going to have a per se

24

rule about what is relevant to prove discrimination.

25

The Court said the same thing in Reeves.
23

I think that

was a unanimous decision.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- what would

3

be the position of the Solicitor General on just saying

4

let's get rid of all these artificial court

5

constructions and say this is like any other case, the

6

plaintiff has the burden of persuasion and the defendant

7

can come up with what defenses he has, including that, I

8

did this for some other reason, it wasn't because of

age, and the jury looks at it and decides who they

believe?

MS. BLATT:

You would still have the same

12

issue as you have under the constitutional regime of

14

Solicitor General in Price Waterhouse itself argued

15

something different that no Justice adopted.

16

a standard of causation that no one -- no one was

persuaded by.

with the burden shifting approach, and three of the

19

Justices would have applied a straight "but for"

difference in the way cases actually come out?

9

Have there been studies on the

MS. BLATT:

No.

Let me just say two

10

responses.

Not that I have seen empirical.

I can tell

11

you the EEOC's experience, and that is they sometimes

12

prefer a "but for" all the burden being on them and

13

sometimes they prefer the motivating factor instruction.

14

And despite what Respondent points out, they have some

15

defendants that think they like the affirmative defense.

16

And sometimes counsel just agree on what the

17

instruction should be.

18

of a problem, although there is a lot of confusion about

19

this kind of case, where the defendant is insisting on

20

one instruction and the plaintiff wants another

21

instruction, and that's what Judge Collatin is reserving

22

in a footnote saying:

23

sort this out.

And it hasn't caused that much

On remand I am going to have to

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Regardless of what the

parties may prefer, isn't it likely that the jury,
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

regardless of instruction, is going to say something

2

like this:

3

the boss's mind when he fired the person, and the boss

4

comes in, regardless of the instructions, and says the

5

guy's work was no good, he got late -- he arrived late

6

and so on, the jury is going to say:

7

fire him because he was old or because he didn't come to

8

work on time?

9

If we find that -- that age really was in

Did they really

They are going to do the same thing that

they are going to do on the burden-shifting instruction,

think what the Court should start with the assumption

issue is, if -- if we are saying do we ditch Price

something to the effect, what difference does it make?

25

MS. BLATT:

Well, I don't think you can
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

ditch Price Waterhouse as a practical matter, because

2

you are going to create -- I mean -- massive confusion,

3

not only under the Age Act, but under the Americans with

5

variety of labor statutes, disciplinary statutes -

Well, you can do that, but all

the problems you think you are solving, you are going to

have to face them in Title VII.

discrimination law, and you have two standards of

causation in that statute right now.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

your third point briefly.

It's essentially this, that this is complicated,

difficult under Title VII.

Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

2
3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

4

It does seem to me in some ways the

5

Petitioner and Respondent in this case are ships passing

6

in the night because the issues here are unbelievably

7

complicated.

8

this Court I have not seen one area of the law that

9

seems to me as difficult to sort out as this particular

10

I will say in 25 years of advocacy before

one is.

11

That said, I would hope that the Court would

12

seize upon this as an opportunity to provide some

13

significant clarity in the law, rather than seize this

14

as an opportunity to decide this case on the potentially

15

most narrow ground, which, frankly, as far as I can

16

tell, will not only not decide this case, ultimately,

17

but certainly will not do anything to resolve the mass

18

confusion that seems to exist among the lower courts.

19

So, I would urge the Court not to evaluate

20

this case strictly on the question of whether direct

21

versus circumstantial evidence is the appropriate way to

22

proceed.

23

on which the Eighth Circuit decided this case.

24
25

In part that's because that is not the basis

The Eighth Circuit said that it interpreted
Justice O'Connor's separate opinion calling for direct
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

evidence as talking about a specific link between the

2

proof -- in the proof of the discriminatory

3

considerations and the adverse action that was taken.

4

So, direct versus circumstantial doesn't even -- you

5

know, if you remand to evaluate non-circumstantial

6

evidence, you are still not going to be in a position

7

where that is going to affect the outcome.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

As I understand the court

of appeals, it said that Justice O'Connor's opinion was

10

the controlling opinion, it was the decision on the

11

narrowest ground; therefore, the lower courts ought to

12

take that decision as the law made by Price Waterhouse.

13

Then there's a question of what did she mean

14

by direct evidence?

15

certainly did say Justice O'Connor's opinion states the

16

law of Price Waterhouse, and that was the basis on which

17

their decision turned.

18

But I think the Eighth Circuit

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, then -- of course, they

19

go on to say what they think that decision means.

20

there is no question, Justice Ginsburg, that that is the

21

basis for that holding.

22

But

So, I mean, I suppose the Court could say,

23

no, we disagree with the basis of Price Waterhouse as

24

Justice White's separate concurring opinion, which,

25

frankly, I think it is -- you know, having read it more
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

times than I care to admit, is not exactly clear as to

2

what he thinks the appropriate standard would have been.

3

At least Justice Ginsburg's provides the formulation

4

that the lower courts can use to try to provide some

5

kind of a jury instruction -

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

(Laughter.)

10
11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice O'Connor.

Did I say Ginsburg?
Yes.

I'm going to hear about this

one.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

But the problem -- you know, the -- but the

15

fundamental problem is, it's just simply not clear what

16

Justice White's opinion means.

17

courts have seized upon an opinion that at least

18

provided serious guidance that they could embody into a

19

jury instruction.

20

I apologize.

And therefore, the lower

It goes to the point that Justice Alito was

21

making, which is that, it's one thing when you are

22

dealing with bench trials and what do you ask the judge

23

to do, it's something fundamentally different when you

24

are shifting the burden of proof.

25

Justice Kennedy asked the question does it
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

make a difference tactically, and the same question

2

Justice Souter in some ways was asking and the answer is

3

clearly it does, and you can see it in this case.

4

Here's a situation where the defendant prior to the

5

trial shows up, or when the jury gets selected.

6

statement says there is going to be no evidence of

7

actual age discrimination in this case.

8

tried on that theory.

9

there is going to be no evidence of age discrimination

Opening

The case is

The basis for the judgment that

10

in this case is the discovery, extensive discovery that

11

has taken place, where there is no statements by anyone

12

talking about age, no other employee who believes that

13

he or she had been ever been affected by age.

14

of this very abstract claim and the notion that somehow

15

there is no better explanation for what happened except

16

for age.

17

It's all

You go through the entirety of the trial

18

saying to the jury, there is no evidence of age, there

19

is no evidence of age discrimination, and then at the

20

last minute, not because you have asserted an

21

affirmative defense -- because we didn't assert an

22

affirmative defense -- one is foisted on us by the jury

23

instruction that the plaintiff asked for in this

24

particular case that says that if there is a motivating

25

factor, if you can prove a motivating factor -- which it
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is interesting to get to the specifics of a motivating

2

factor, which means it played a part or a role, which is

3

about as minimalist as you can have it -- then the

4

burden shifts and we then have the burden to prove that

5

we would have taken the same action notwithstanding age.

6
7

Well, that's a very different inquiry, and
when you go to the jury at the end you can't conceive -

23
24

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, I don't believe he would

be required to enter judgment on the defendant.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Because all that would

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have been proved was there is one motivating factor

2

there, but not necessarily a decisive one.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, but I -- it does seem

4

to me that the jury -- it would be fair to ask the jury

5

to decide which of those two considerations probably

6

played the greater role.

7

I think taking it to the jury is one thing.

8

the burden of proof to insist that we prove that the -

9

that the nondiscriminatory ground was the primary reason

But I think -- and that's why
Switching

10

for the decision is -- is an inappropriate way to

11

proceed because there is no basis in the statute for

12

that.

13

that there was discrimination because of.

The plaintiff still retains the burden to prove

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But he has only proved

15

that it is one of two possible motivating factors, but

16

that is sufficient in your view to get to the jury.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

I would think that that would

18

be sufficient to get to the jury, because I don't think

19

we have to prove -- I don't think the plaintiff has to

20

prove, you know, obviously, beyond a reasonable doubt or

21

anything.

22

that those are the two grounds, and I think in some ways

23

that -- that is the sort of common sense basis on which

24

Price Waterhouse was decided.

25

it's important -- if -- you know, the Chamber of

I mean, I think the jury could fairly say

2

Stevens, on this multi-member decisionmaking body.

3

you know, it seems to me if you look at cases like Mt.

4

Healthy and Price Waterhouse, those are all cases where

5

you have multi-member decisionmakers, and some of whom

6

may have expressed some biases and others of whom

7

clearly didn't, and how do you deal with that situation,

8

which impresses me as fundamentally different that the

9

situation here where you have a single supervisor

And

10

dealing with a single employee and where the case is

11

tried on the theory that there has been no

12

discrimination whatsoever, and it's up to the jury to

13

make that determination at the end, and at the last

14

minute we have the jury instruction that shifts the

15

burden to us notwithstanding that -

Now, he already fired Smith because he was too old.

4

I take it he can make the defense:

5

have been fired anyway; that isn't the reason I fired

him, but he would have been fired anyway, and he can get

off.

next instruction -

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.
-- it says a -- "Plaintiff's

10

age was a motivating factor if plaintiff's age played a

11

part or a role in the defendant's decision."

12

motivating factor" is a very narrow formulation -

13
14
15
16
17

JUSTICE BREYER:

So "a

Fine, okay, all right,

fine.
MR. PHILLIPS:

-- as instruction in this

particular case.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Perfect, perfect.

I didn't

18

want to complicate it, but that may work in your favor

19

to complicate it, and I want to be fair.

20

(Laughter.)

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Fine.

It played a part.

22

It did have a role:

Age motivated in part.

Now why

23

isn't that the end of the matter?

24

statute that says age shouldn't play a role in.

25

Because we have a

5

It was an understudy, a

It "played a role" if it would have made a
"Played a part," it would have made a

So we have an action, other things being

6

equal, that should be illegal under this statute.

7

then, just as in the first case, we give the employer a

8

defense:

9

age there in your mind, you would have done it anyway,

If you can show that in the absence of that

10

which means the mix of motives would have been

11

different, then you get off.

12

But

So, if in the first case we in fact say it

13

should be on the -- burden should be on the employer,

14

why shouldn't it be in the second case?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I mean -- in the first

16

place, saying that something is a motivating factor or

17

played a role is, as a sufficient basis on which to

18

impose liability, is flatly inconsistent with what this

19

Court has said numerous time.

20

said it in Reeves, it said it in Hazen Paper, it said it

21

I think last term in the Kentucky case, where it says it

22

has to play a role and be determinative.

23

standard the Court has announced over and over again in

24

age discrimination cases.

25

It said it in Burdine, it

And that's the

The "a motivating factor" formulation does
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

come in Title VII, but that's because of the 1991

2

statute that specifically frames the argument in terms

3

of "a motivating factor."

4

here is that, unless the Court deviates from the

5

historic practice, which is if you are in civil

6

litigation the plaintiff retains the burden of proof

7

throughout the process -

8
9

So the -- the bottom line

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Price Waterhouse

deviated -- that was -

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

I'm sorry?

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We have these two regimes

12

out there.

13

everything should follow that pattern, but to do that

14

you have to overrule Price Waterhouse, which gave

15

recognition to the mixed motive framework that comes out

16

of Mt. Healthy.

17

You are reciting McDonnell Douglas and say

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, my basic point on Price

18

Waterhouse is that it seemed to me reasonably clear that

19

a majority of the Court, whether you -- whether you rely

20

upon Justice White or Justice O'Connor -- clearly didn't

21

intend for the jury -- for the burden of proof to shift

22

willy-nilly.

23

the rule, narrowly defined.

24
25

But it's supposed to be an exception to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the reality Mr. Schnapper recognized

when I asked this question, how does this differ from
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the prima facie case that you make under McDonnell

2

Douglas and -- he said:

3

preliminary showing; we have to establish by a

4

preponderance of the evidence that the prohibited

5

discrimination was a motivating factor.

6

We don't have to just make a

MR. PHILLIPS:

Played -- played a role.

7

There is no question about that, Justice Ginsburg.

But

8

that is not much different, frankly, from a prima facie

9

showing.

The truth is if you only make a prima facie

10

showing and the defendant doesn't show up, you will have

11

in fact satisfied your burden.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, you will get to the

13

jury and if the jury accepts all your evidence, the jury

14

can find in your favor.

15

prima facie showing and what has to be shown here is,

16

the jury must actually find, based on your at least

17

prima facie evidence, that age was a motivating factor,

18

and until the jury makes that finding, if it is properly

19

instructed, it doesn't get to the question of whether

20

the defendant has any burden to show something in

21

response.

22

But the difference between a

Isn't that correct?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, there is no question --

23

I mean, although again what a motivating factor means is

24

still to my mind extraordinarily narrow in this -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Phillips, let me

just MR. PHILLIPS:

-- or limited in terms of

what is required here.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm not quite sure I

5

understand one thing.

If it's a motivating factor, it's

6

enough to get by summary judgment and get the case to

7

the jury, but the -- the defendant will still win, if I

8

understand all this, if he -- if the defendant proves,

9

yes, I did do and it may have had an influence on it,

10

but he would have fired him anyway.

11

can prove under Mt. Healthy that, yes, he thought about

12

age and that -- what raised the issue and everything

13

else, but after he got all through, he was clear he

14

fired him because he was a lousy salesman -

And if he -- if he

But, Justice -- and he wins.

Clearly he would win under

those circumstances, but the problem there is JUSTICE STEVENS:

So he does not lose just

because you say it's a motivating factor.
MR. PHILLIPS:

No, he doesn't lose, but the

22

question is, what do you do once you make that finding?

23

Do you, in fact, at the plaintiff's behest, shift the

24

burden of proof to the defendant?

25

thing, and the Solicitor General, you know, has properly

I mean, it admits one

Alderson Reporting Company

identified that in some instances the defendants as a

2

tactical matter are willing to accept as an affirmative

3

defense and -- and pursue the course you just

4

articulated, Justice Stevens.

5

But that's not what happened in this case.

6

We were not prepared to accept the idea that age played

a role.

8

that.

prove that the defendant's factor played a role.

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

So is the law here -- am I

5

wrong about ordinary tort law?

it that well.

7

special?

8

of those three?

9

hope not.

10
11

Possibly.

I don't know

Is it that I -- is it that this area is

Is it that there are cases so you can say any
I am prepared to be totally wrong.

MR. PHILLIPS:

I

I am always reluctant to say

that, Justice Breyer.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

You can say that.
I think that, in ordinary

14

tort law, the standard of causation is both a

15

combination of "but for" and proximate causation, so -

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I think "played a role"

17

combines at least the necessary condition, but I don't

18

know -

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23
24
25

Well, I don't think -- if you have to -- that's a fair "Played a role" -- how did

it play a role if it was not a necessary?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Ginsburg, at least as

I read the difference between the plurality opinion in
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Price Waterhouse and -- and all of the other opinions in

2

that case, Price Waterhouse's plurality said a

3

motivating factor is actually a standard below "but for"

4

causation.

5

"but for" causation as a requirement under the Age

6

Discrimination and Employment Act.

7

Justices seemed to not -- not accept that.

8

seems to me the very -- yes, the basic holding of the

9

plurality -- again, not of the Court -- is that

The plurality was unwilling to accept even

The rest of the
But that

10

something less than "but for" causation is required.

11

would be delighted, candidly, if the court would go back

12

to just "but for" causation as the element of age

13

discrimination because I think, if you get to that

14

point, you get out of this business of trying to figure

15

out at what point do you shift the burden.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I

If you -

But that question -- I

17

think it can't be before us.

We would certainly want to

18

know what the government's position is on it.

19

Blatt was very clear that the government is not taking a

20

position on that issue today.

21

did not so much as mention McDonnell Douglas.

22

anybody to think that was at stake, that that regime,

23

which you later clarify in your Respondent's brief, you

24

think should be the sole test?

25

this case when it's not in the brief in opposition and,

And Ms.

How could that come into

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

therefore, it's not in the Petitioner's brief and it's

2

not in the government's brief?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, to be clear about this,

4

I'm not pushing so much the, quote, McDonnell Douglas

5

framework as I am Burdine, Hazen Paper, and the other

6

cases that talk about "determinative factor."

7

we're saying is -

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
following that same formula.

10

following that litany:

11

reason -

12

And all

But your line is
All those cases are

prima facie case, discriminatory

MR. PHILLIPS:

Determinative factor, right.

13

I think the answer to the question, Justice Ginsburg, is

14

the -- the way the Chief Justice asked the question,

15

which is, how sensible is it to pull the one thread out

16

of -- out of the Price Waterhouse analysis, assuming

17

that Justice O'Connor speaks for the Court in some

18

sense, you know, without examining how that plays in,

19

given the underlying theory of the case?

20

that's a perfectly valid point.

21

additional briefing is warranted, then it would seem to

22

me the right answer is to -- is to call for additional

23

briefing, but I think -

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I think

If the Court thinks

The Solicitor General

says, well, this is going to affect Title VII.
45
Alderson Reporting Company

It's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

going to affect all kinds of other acts.

2

watershed.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, Justice Kennedy,

4

clearly it's going to affect Title VII.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

This is a

You -- pardon me?

Clearly is it going to affect

Title VII.

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Because it's statutory.

Right, because there's a

10

specific statute that defines it as a motivating factor,

11

shifts the burden, and creates an entire remedial regime

12

that doesn't exist under the age discrimination statute.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let's -- let's assume we

14

have authority to incorporate the Title VII

15

jurisprudence into the ADEA area as a matter of choice.

16

Are there reasons why there should be distinctions

17

between the two regimes?

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think the primary one

19

is the 1991 amendment, where Congress clearly changed

20

the language in Title VII.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are there reasons of

22

administration or fairness other than -- I recognize

23

that one is statutory and the others would -- would be

24

our case law.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it seems to me it's
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

beyond that.

2

powers problem when you say it's statutory because,

3

again, Congress very consciously decided to modify Title

4

VII, created a complete regime.

5

stretch for this Court not only to modify the standards

6

in a way that would change substantive liability but

7

would create the -- the affirmative defense as a

8

remedial component of it.

9

I mean, there's almost a separation of

JUSTICE ALITO:

It would be a bit of a

Well, in addition to that,

10

Mr. Phillips, isn't age more closely correlated with

11

legitimate reasons for employment discrimination than

12

race and other factors that are proscribed by Title VII?

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Both Congress and this Court

14

have recognized precisely that as a problem.

15

there are reasons to treat age discrimination

16

differently from other forms of discrimination.

17

again, you know, there's no question that if you revisit

18

Price Waterhouse, it will change some -- the Americans

19

with Disabilities Act and some of the other provisions.

20

I mean,

But,

But the reality is, if you are talking about

21

a mess to begin with, the truth is the lower courts are

22

in a state of -- of disrepair at this point in any

23

event.

24
25

And it's even shown in this case.
I mean, the truth is the Eighth Circuit has

three different formulations of Justice O'Connor's
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

evidence standard:

2

substantial evidence, substantial factor.

3

a district court judge sitting in the Eighth Circuit,

4

you can pick any one of those -- those three to go with.

5

circumstantial, strong evidence, and

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if you are

Can I get back to

6

Justice Stevens's hypothetical?

7

making a decision; one says it's because of age and the

8

one says it's because of something, and -- a legitimate

9

factor -- and you acknowledge that could get to the

10

You have two people

jury?

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

Yes, I believe it could.
And is it under an

instruction that simply says "because of"?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes -- I mean, if you were

15

asking me how I would decide that case, yes, I think it

16

ought to be -- it ought to be because of.

17

Now, if the Court wants to formulate some

18

greater specificity of how the causation standards

19

apply, that's fine.

20

the Court would do well to go back at least to the

21

notion of "but for" causation as embodied in the Age

22

Discrimination and Employment Act.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24
25

But, at a minimum, it seems to me

Well, but I mean -

you say MR. PHILLIPS:

It has never rejected that as
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a Court.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You say "but for"

3

causation, but my understanding of Justice Stevens's

4

hypothetical is that it's going to be very hard to say

5

that one would not have had -- the discrimination, the

6

alleged action, would not have happened but for one

7

factor or the other if they are just two different

8

factors.

9

say because of?

10

You would just leave that up to the jury to

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- it seems to me juries

11

are asked to make that kind of a decision.

12

Justice Souter:

13

lawyers.

14

I agree with

Juries are a lot smarter than the

Well, but not only that,

but the jury would be free to say, well, there were both

clauses, and the one was illegal.

20

And in those situations -- look, Justice O'Connor's

21

analysis of this certainly -- certainly plays to a kind

22

of gut feeling.

23

illustration of it, even maybe more so, when you say:

24

We are firing you for two reasons; one of them is

25

completely invalid, and the other is completely valid.

When you -- and Mt. Healthy is a good

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

What are you supposed to do in that situation?

2

But it seems to me that under -- under

3

normal civil litigation rules, and the ones that

4

Congress clearly had in its mind, the approach you would

5

take under those circumstances say that's enough to get

6

you to the jury, but that's not enough to force the jury

7

to be instructed that they have to rule in favor of the

8

plaintiff unless the defendant can show that but-for,

9

that -- that no matter -- regardless of the

10

discriminatory animus, they nevertheless would have

11

taken precisely the same action.

That, to me, is the

burden of proof shift?

16

where there's no assertion of an affirmative defense -

17

whereas, I think, Justice Stevens, in your situations,

18

there were -- you know, most likely you would expect a

19

defendant to say, I want to accept that burden because I

20

think I can in fact prove something.

21

It's about under what circumstances does the
And -- and in a case like this

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I know, but inevitably in

22

these cases the employer is really -- whether he calls

23

it an affirmative defense or -- or just a regular

resistance to the plaintiff 's case, the issue is:

-- would he have fired him anyway?

And -- and if he -

if -- if that's what the jury believes, you can take

2

Justice Breyer's view and say that's -- that's not a

3

sufficient defense because they acted illegally.

4

But if you are allowed that, you are saying

MR. PHILLIPS:

And you win despite the

There -- there is no question

10

about that.

11

Who bears the burden of proof?

12

all of those decisions of this Court that say that

13

the -- that the -- that the burden to -- to show that

14

age, or whatever, was the determinative factor rests

15

throughout on the plaintiff?

16

And it is -- again, the only question is:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And what do you do with

But those weren't -

17

those weren't thought of in the mixed motive framework.

18

And what you want to do is get rid of the mixed motive

19

and say in a discrimination case there should be only

20

one regime, and the plaintiff should have the burden of

21

persuasion from start to finish.

22

McDonnell Douglas did.

did, which you acknowledge by not even bringing this up

24

until the brief on the merits.

4

question.

5

The statute has taken care of it in 1991.

She urges us not to touch this

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think you have to go

6

back to the -- to the question that Justice Alito posed

7

actually, to say -- when -- when he asked her:

8

you -- how much sense does it make to think about mixed

9

motive versus other motive?

How do

Isn't it true that by the

10

time the case gets to the jury everything is mixed

11

motive, because there is going to be the claim that this

12

was -- and this is a great illustration of that concept.

13

There is a claim that age was the basis for the

14

decision, and there is a claim that there are any of a

15

thousand other possible reasons that are out there, and

16

age just didn't happen to be one.

17
18

And under those circumstances the question
is:

What's the reasonable way to proceed?

19

Now, Justice Ginsburg, I apologize that we

20

didn't raise this specifically in the brief in

21

opposition.

22

primary position that was taken by the other side was

23

that this Court essentially can ignore or should

24

overrule a portion of Price Waterhouse as a consequence

25

of the -- of the intervening Costa decision.

On the other hand, the reality is that the

52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And it seems to me under those

2

circumstances, if you are going to put the issue of the

3

validity of Price Waterhouse -- whatever it means -- at

4

issue, then it seems to us a reasonable response on the

5

merits to say, well, you shouldn't do it as -- as a -

6

in isolation.

7

inquiry, and you ought to take a step back and say,

8

maybe we haven't gotten this right in the first place,

9

particularly given the difficulty of the lower courts in

That that's a completely artificial

10

trying to figure out exactly what Price Waterhouse

11

means.

12

Whose is the controlling opinion, and how do

13

you allocate these burdens and under what circumstances?

14

And given that the lower courts are in disarray, it

15

would seem to me this is a situation where I don't know

16

whether this is the best vehicle or the worst vehicle,

17

but it is certainly an appropriate vehicle for the Court

18

to step back and evaluate it.

19

And if the Court is concerned about whether

20

it has enough information to allow it to assess what

21

would be the -- the significant impact of revising Price

22

Waterhouse, then it seems to me the right answer would

23

be to ask the parties to -- to brief that in addition to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I assume -- and I

assume the government, because it would certainly be

informative to know what the agency responsible for the

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- I don't disagree with

6

that, Justice Ginsburg.

I -- I don't think there are

7

any -- any guidelines out there that speak directly to

8

this specific question.

that the Solicitor General could speak for the EEOC,

But, obviously, to the extent

10

that would -- I am not denying that that would -- that

what it should not do in this case is take the -- the

very narrowest way of vacating and remanding.

Because

if it follows that course, nothing will move.

Nothing

will have been achieved by all the work that has been

and circumstantial evidence.

at some point is going to have to evaluate beyond the

21

quality of the evidence what quantity of evidence is

22

appropriate under the circumstances.

But I think what the -- what the

And, therefore, the Court

It seems to me the Court has that in front

of it.

The jury instruction in this case shifted the

burden way too early or on -- on way too little showing.

version.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

no question about quantitative evidence here.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, there is a question

about the adequacy of the jury instruction.

8

We can't -- I mean there is

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The adequacy of the jury

instruction, but there isn't a question as to whether

10

the issue should have gone to the jury in the first

11

place.

12

Right.

No, I don't -- there

It's not before you.

motivating factor, meaning that it played a role, is a

sufficient basis on which to trigger the -- the burden

narrowest basis on which this Court could affirm by

21

simply saying that Justice White's opinion requires a

substantial showing.

clearly doesn't accomplish that, and, therefore, the

Court should set that aside, or the Court should affirm

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

We are in agreement with the government that

11

the Court should decide the -- the narrow question

12

presented and not revisit Price Waterhouse.

13

respond to the question from Justice Breyer -- and I am

14

going to summarize to some extent materials which were

15

referred to in footnote 18 of our reply brief.

16

If I might

The Court ruled that there was a

17

circumstance, very well established, which under tort

18

law but-for causation was not the standard.

19

was the situation in Cory versus Havener, which is the

20

leading case in this area in which there were two

21

causes, each sufficient to have brought about the

22

result.

either cause could be held liable.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Don't those cases involve

3

two independent physical causes of an event, not the

4

breaking down of human motivation into -- into separate

5

factors?

6
7

MR. SCHNAPPER:

it's the analogous area of tort law.

8
9

Well, it's -- it's -- but

JUSTICE BREYER:

What they are trying to

say, which is -- which is making me think -- it is a lot

10

about -- we have a human being who did certain acts.

11

And we know this.

We know that human being had a mix of

That's the end of it.

But then we are going to let someone off if

17

we imagine a different, but hypothetical, situation.

18

The hypothetical is where the bad motive isn't there.

Well, it's hard to prove what human beings

would do in a hypothetical situation that isn't the real

And I take it that's the reason we have

Is there an analogy to that in tort law?

MR. SCHNAPPER:

25

The -- the problem that

comes up with multiple causes is it is hard to
57

reconstruct what would happen.

And there is a long line

2

of cases, including a number of decisions by Learned

3

Hand in 1938, one which we have cited, Transportation

4

Management, in which the lower courts have agreed that

5

where multiple factors are involved it's reasonable to

6

put the burden on the defendant which -- of sorting it

7

all out.
