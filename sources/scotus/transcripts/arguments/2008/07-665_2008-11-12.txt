ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY A. SEKULOW

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. SEKULOW:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Tenth Circuit erred when it held that

12

the First Amendment Free Speech Clause forces Pleasant

13

Grove City to accept and erect on its property a private

14

party's donated, unattended, permanent monument.

15

The decision suffers from two constitutional

16

defects:

17

Ten Commandments monument constitutes private speech

18

rather than Government speech is wrong.

19

the monuments on display in Pioneer Park have been

20

selected by the Government, are owned by the Government,

21

controlled by the Government, and are displayed on

22

Government property.

23

it is free from the traditional free speech constraints

24

of the First Amendment.

25

First, the court's conclusion that a donated

Second, the court compounded its error by

further concluding that Pioneer Park is a traditional

2

public forum for the erection of permanent, unattended

3

monuments by private parties.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Sekulow, you're

5

really just picking your poison, aren't you?

I mean,

6

the more you say that the monument is Government speech

7

to get out of the first, free speech -- the Free Speech

8

Clause, the more it seems to me you're walking into a

9

trap under the Establishment Clause.

If it's Government

10

speech, it may not present a free speech problem, but

11

what is the Government doing speaking -- supporting the

12

Ten Commandments?

13

MR. SEKULOW:

Well, the Ten Commandments

going to say it's Government speech and you have an

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I suppose it depends on

14

what the Government speech consists of, what it is the

15

Government is saying about the Ten Commandments.

16

Government is saying the Ten Commandments are the word

17

19

national heritage, that's something else.

There is a 36-year history

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Sekulow, can I just

2

ask:

3

raise the Government speech argument?

4

At what point in the litigation did you first

MR. SEKULOW:

At the Tenth Circuit.

The

5

Tenth Circuit, the existing law in the Tenth Circuit in

6

the Summum line of cases mandated a private speech

7

determination, even if the speech was controlled or

8

known by the Government, if it originated with a third

9

party.

As soon as we were before -- and under Tenth

10

Circuit rules that's binding, of course, on the district

11

court and on the panel.

12

But even in the panel brief, we raise the

13

issue of Government speech and the Court addressed it

14

both as to -- and, Justice Kennedy, going back to your

15

point -- both as to Government speech and to the speech

16

selection cases of Forbes, Finley, and American Library

17

Association.

18

to what's at issue here.

24

that there is.

25

that there is -- is in fact a mixture, that it is both

I will assume and I do indeed assume

Isn't the tough issue here the claim

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Government and private.

2

continuing to be private speech I take it is simply the

3

Eagles identification with the presentation and their

4

espousal of what the monument says.

5

think we ought to deal with the mixture issue.

6

MR. SEKULOW:

And the argument for its

How -- how do you

Well, I think the fact that it

7

originated, that the monument originated by the Eagles

8

as a third party, doesn't in any way take away from the

9

fact that in this particular case, and in most cases

10

involving donated monuments, which, as the United States

11

would point to, most of the monuments in parks are

12

donated by or originated with third parties -

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They probably are, but most

14

of them -- and you correct me if I'm wrong here.

15

don't suppose that most of them -- most of them contain

16

as part of -- in a prominent place in the monument

17

itself contain the statement that, you know, this is the

18

gift of or the position of or what-not of X, Y or Z,

19

whereas this monument does.

20

MR. SEKULOW:

But I

Most of them, Justice Souter,

21

do actually have statements.

In fact, a perfect example

22

would be at Gettysburg National Military Park a number

23

of those monuments, most of them, are donated by or

JUSTICE SOUTER:

coming.

3

MR. SEKULOW:

I hope not.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But tell me, what is the

5

criterion that we should use to decide what the

6

significance of the private identification is?

7

MR. SEKULOW:

I think the key should be, as

8

this Court alluded to in Johanns, the issue of control,

9

who controls the message ultimately here.

And the fact

10

is the Statue of Liberty originated by the

11

Franco-American Union -- was originated by a third

12

party.

13

that point title transfer.

The United States by resolution accepted it.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If that -- if we accept

15

that there is Government speech, I think Justice

16

Souter's question is isn't this really the Government

17

endorsement of the Eagles' message?

18

are all over this monument, their symbol of the eagle,

19

and the Eagles want it to be known that this is their

20

monument.

21

the district court there, wasn't the statement, well,

22

this -- Texas did this in recognition of the good work

23

that the Eagles do in preventing -- - help try to

24

prevent juvenile delinquency.

25

At

I mean, the Eagles

Indeed, I think in Van Orden wasn't the -- in

MR. SEKULOW:

Right.

And I think that

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

actually points to why that once it's controlled and

2

owned by the Government the fact that it originated in

3

the third party, Justice Ginsburg, changes the equation

4

for ownership and control to the Government.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, if it does, it

6

changes it, as I understand your answer, by eliminating

7

the private aspect of the speech.

8

answer to me is it's not a mixture.

9

MR. SEKULOW:

10
11

So that your real

It's not.

mixture the moment the Government accepts it.

that's kind of in the background of the case?

2

MR. SEKULOW:

Sure.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Assume you didn't have the

4

policy that you do have, but it was perfectly clear that

5

the city decided not to put up this monument because it

6

disagreed with the message of the monument.

7

call it Government speech or private speech, would that

be permissible?

That's what they did.
But it doesn't seem to me

7

that you have to make the Government speech argument for

8

you to make the argument that you just made.

9

MR. SEKULOW:

No, not necessarily, because

10

even under the speech selection cases -- I mean, that's

11

correct -- Governments make determinations of what they

12

are going to put in their parks to communicate a

13

message.

14

where the Tenth Circuit panel was incorrect and

15

Respondents are incorrect:

16

the Government actually creating a forum or a venue for

17

speech -- and a perfect example of that would be here,

18

with ownership and control vesting in the city.

19

different in that situation than the typical equal

20

access case, where the Government merely opens up its

21

facilities for a variety of viewpoints, Justice Stevens,

22

and then cannot engage in content-based or

viewpoint-based -

2

4

hides the ball in effect and says in effect, we'll -

5

we'll let monuments be placed on -- we will accept

6

monuments from people who want to place them on our

property if the monuments have some kind of an arguable

8

historical connection or a connection with people with

long association with the community, as long as they

But if the city

10

have that sort of criterion in mind then they can select

11

any way they want to?

12

MR. SEKULOW:

Justice Souter, there is a

13

fundamental difference between opening up a forum,

14

taking acres of a park and saying everybody gets to go

15

in, and another situation where the Government is

16

clearly controlling it not for a subversive reason.

17

I think the evidence in these cases, in these series of

18

cases, pointing to Justice Kennedy's concern about what

19

does it mean for future cases, here it is

20

uncontroverted:

21

injunction ultimately was issued by the Tenth Circuit

22

disregarded or at least cast doubt on the declaration of

23

the park administrator, who had been involved in city

government since 1972, who stated -- and it can be found

on pages 102 through 104 of the joint appendix -- that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It goes to the same thing,

doesn't it?

7

the message or whether it's the Government creating a

8

limited public forum for the presentation of only those

9

messages that it thinks are important, it comes to the

10

I mean, whether it's the Government stating

same thing, doesn't it?

11

MR. SEKULOW:

Well, it depends on -- if it's

12

a limited public forum, certainly limited public forums

13

can be based on subject matter and speaker identity.

14

This Court said that, said that consistently, Cornelius

15

and Perry.

16

public forum appears to be more of a non-public forum

17

type of analysis, certainly.

18

public forum, it could be limited in that regard.

19

So in that context, and now that limited

Even in the designated

I think that points to the confusion of what

20

took place here.

The Court in our view conflated those

21

two issues, the issue of forum and Government speech.

22

And while they're both separate basis upon which we

23

believe the Tenth Circuit opinion could be reversed and

24

vacate the issuance of the injunction, the reality is

25

that in this particular case once title passed and
17

owner and effectively controlled.

The second is that this -- even if it was

subcategories in a very absolute way.

3

this what it is -- it's a mixture of private speech with

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, as a matter of the Free

Speech Clause, there are no limits on the Government's

6

ability to speak freely.

7

Clause, the Establishment Clause, perhaps the Due

8

Process Clause, there might be thought to be independent

9

checks on the Government's speech.

Under the Equal Protection

But the Free Speech

10

Clause, whatever else it does, does not prevent the

11

Government from speaking freely.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It seems to me the

13

Government could disfavor homosexuality just as it could

14

disfavor abortion, just as it can disfavor a number of

15

other things that in -- in many States people are free

16

to do.

The Government can disfavor all of it, can't it?
MR. JOSEFFER:

The Government would be

powerless to do anything if it cannot first formulate

19

and then express its own viewpoints.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why is that the answer to

21

the -- the question?

Why isn't the answer to the

question that monuments generally are not -- the

erection of monuments generally are not a forum?

is a fundamental difference between the speaker's corner

2

3

And if you have the unusual situation where

4

you are have a monument that is really analogous to a

5

forum, then the forum analysis would be applicable.

6

to apply it to something like the Washington Monument or

7

the Jefferson Memorial is ridiculous.

8

MR. JOSEFFER:

9

When the -- when the

Government -- and this is a point I started on earlier.

10

When the Government is acting as a curator as in the

11

museum context, normal forum principles do not apply.

12

But

In Forbes, for example, this Court held that

13

when the Government acts as a public broadcaster it

14

normally can engage in viewpoint discrimination outside

15

of an exception for candidate debates.

16

the same point applies here to monuments, I think, for a

17

combination of three reasons.

18

And the -- and

First, the Government has an overwhelming

19

interest as a property owner in not being saddled with

20

structures it does not want; second, the limits on the

21

availability of public space you refer to; and, third,

22

the Government's sovereign interest in using monuments

23

on its own property to tell its own story, as the

24

Federal Government has done here on the Mall.

25

It's similar to, for example, a sculpture
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

garden or -- and -- a sculpture garden where the

2

Government can choose what sculptures to put in the

3

sculpture garden without necessarily having some

4

overriding theme or overriding reason.

5

If I could give two examples of that, in

6

Meridian Hill Park here in Northwest D.C., between 15th

7

and 16th streets, the Government chose to accept and

8

place a variety of privately donated structures that

9

have no evident connection to one another.

10

They cover

people as diverse as Joan of Arc, President Buchanan -

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

But suppose they only

accept Democrats who are sculptors, and they reject all

13

the Republicans?

MR. JOSEFFER:

As a matter of policy

--

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, what in the First

not stop that?

The Free Speech Clause on its

own force does not prevent the Government from speaking

freely.

22

the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, It is hard to see

23

how the Government would have a legitimate governmental

24

interest in pure partisan activity.

25

But as a matter of rational basis review under

But the Free Speech Clause, what it does is
27
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that it -- it limits the extent to which the Government

2

can regulate other people's speech.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, under the Equal

4

Protection Clause would -- if you wrote an Equal

5

Protection Clause opinion, you would end up saying it's

6

content-based.

That's the First Amendment.

MR. JOSEFFER:

If it's Government speech,

though -

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I don't think that

10

can you avoid the hard part by saying, oh, other

11

amendments of the Constitution might apply.

12

of the question is whether the Government may

13

discriminate based on content, and that's a First

14

Amendment question.

15

MR. JOSEFFER:

The heart

But when the Government is

16

speaking or when the Government is acting as a curator

17

as with a museum or a sculpture garden or a library or

18

here, the Government is absolutely entitled to make both

19

content and viewpoint-based distinctions.

20

you get the absurd result -

content and viewpoint discrimination in this context.

What you are, in effect,

saying -- and this may be -- I don't mean I think this

is necessarily the wrong answer -- but you're, in

9

effect, saying, yes, you can find instances of

10

Government speech in which there is clearly a -- a

11

private identification consistent with it, but the only

12

appropriate analysis is the analysis for government

13

speech.

14

one or the other; and it is -- it is the Government

15

aspect which controls the First Amendment purposes.

16

That, I take it, is your answer?

17

You can't have it both ways, you've got to pick

MR. JOSEFFER:

Yes.

And when we are talking

about physical objects that constitute the speech,

that's oftentimes the case in museums, sculpture

MR. JOSEFFER:

no less absurd, because we've been doing it in public

fact, there are thousands of privately donated monuments

and sculptures in public parks across the country, and I

suspect a great many of them don't have some formal

disclaimer on them saying "I am the United States and I

Government speech has ever been thought to work.

example.

Just by chance yesterday I was taking a walk

in a little neighborhood park , and I saw that there was

a monument -- a small monument, donated, and it says

18

right on there donated by a private neighborhood

association to commemorate a number of people who were

20

killed in the 9-11 attack on the Pentagon.

21

searched the town records or the county record and I

22

don't find any resolution saying they adopted this

monument as their monument, does that mean that if I

would like to put up a monument in the park to

25

commemorate loved ones who died, or people who I

respect, I have a First Amendment right to do that?

MS. HARRIS:

three separate reasons.

4

that the Government -- even privately donated monuments

5

often involve a great deal of Government involvement at

6

the front end, when they are created.

7

works in partnership with private donors to create the

8

content of that monument.

9

No, Your Honor, and really for
First of the all, it may be

Well what if the situation

10

is a neighborhood association prepared this; they said

11

we'd like to display it in the park; and the county or

12

the town says fine, go ahead and do it?

13

MS. HARRIS:

Even under those more usual

14

circumstances there would be two things the city could

15

do to keep you out of their park.

As I said, they could

16

adopt the monument that is there.

The other thing any

17

city can do is adopt some kind of a content-neutral ban,

18

or a content-neutral limit, on the number of private

19

displays it wants to have in its park.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ms. Harris, we -- we need a

21

clear rule here.

22

the cities for that matter to investigate in every case

23

what the degree of the Government's involvement in

for the Government to make clear that it has adopted a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

You're saying the last

generation had much more freedom than the present one?

5

MS. HARRIS:

I'm saying that as long as it

6

does it on a content-neutral basis, because it is

7

genuinely concerned about aesthetics, space constraints,

8

clutter in its parks, a city can enact a ban or a limit

9

on the number of displays; and if that has the effect of

10

grandfathering in existing displays -

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can we go back to -- your

12

basic premise is this is a public forum, in any and all

13

instances; and we do have, certainly in the speech area,

14

demonstration area, from time immemorial public parks

15

have been places where people can speak their minds.

16

But I don't know of any tradition that says people can

17

come to the park with monuments and put them up if they

18

will, so long as they meet the equivalent of time, place

19

and manner.

20

So you're making an assumption that from

21

time immemorial, monuments, just like speeches, can be

22

presented by anyone who wants to.

23

MS. HARRIS:

No, Justice Ginsburg.

24

Monuments are different from speeches and because

25

monuments are different, the Court has held that unlike
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

oratory, a city can decide to close its parks entirely

2

to all private unattended displays.

"We've heard enough speeches; no more speeches."

If that -- it that is so,

what is the point of using the public forum analysis at

Because here the city has not

The city has not closed -- it has not made

10

the decision that it will bar all private unattended

11

displays.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That -- that may mean that

13

you have the foundation for a -- a speech discrimination

14

argument -

15

MS. HARRIS:

That -

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- but that would not be

17

the answer if we were dealing with a -- a traditional

18

public forum in -- in the sense that the Court's cases

19

have used the term.

20

MS. HARRIS:

Oh, I think -

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So it seems to me that your

22

use of public forum is just by kind of remote analogy

23

here, and I -- I'm not sure that it's helping you or

24

would help us if we used it as criterion for decision.

25

MS. HARRIS:

Oh, I think it may be helpful,
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

Justice Souter, because once we know that we are talking

2

about a public forum, we know that access cannot be

3

limited on a content basis.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, your -- you can

5

stick with it as long as you want; that's what the -

6

the Tenth Circuit did, but suppose that we were to say

7

that we were unconvinced by the comparison between

8

speeches and parades on the one hand and monuments on

9

the other, so we did not apply the public forum analogy.

10

Would that be the end of your case?

11

MS. HARRIS:

Oh, no, Justice Kennedy.

Even

12

outside a public forum, in any context -- even in a

13

museum or library -- in any context in which the

Government is regulating private speech, it may not act

in a way that is designed to suppress one particularly

prefer certain viewpoints over others, but here the city

2

has consistently refused to adopt the content of this

3

monument as its own, and it is still disclaiming

endorsement of that monument.

5

justification for that Government speech exception is

6

that sometimes, as the United States has said, the

it's not doing that here.

24

if this case were being litigated under the

25

Establishment Clause, it wouldn't be critical whether
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the monument were actually Government speech, because

2

the Establishment Clause can be implicated by the

3

Government's interaction with private speech as well.

4

That said, I do not think it's the case that anybody who

5

came across this monument would know that the Government

6

is speaking.

7

The monument says it is presented by the

8

Eagles.

It has the Eagles emblem.

The mayor himself

9

testified in his deposition that he thought the monument

10

was owned by the city, because it's the Eagles and not

11

the -- I'm sorry; was owned by the Eagles, because it is

12

the Eagles and not the city that maintains that

13

monument.

14

I think there is a very real question about

15

what people would think here and if those perceptions

16

are important the easy way to clarify it is for the city

17

to step up and adopt the monument as Government speech,

18

which it won't do here.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't merely allowing the

20

monument to be built on public property sufficient

21

acceptance?

22

like to put up a monument in your front yard, and you

23

said sure go ahead, do that, aren't you accepting

24

that -- whatever the monument says, in a sense?

25

If somebody came up to you and said I'd

MS. HARRIS:

Your Honor, my front yard is
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

different from a public park, and that matters because

2

when all the Government has done is said sure, go ahead,

3

put your monument in our park, that's all the Government

4

ever does when it administers access to a public forum.

5

If it's doing it on a content basis, that's a problem.

6

The Government -

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but it doesn't -- it

8

doesn't have to do that, say, for time place and manner

9

restrictions for access to a public forum if it really

10

is a public forum.

11

here.

12

There is something more involved

This is closer to the case of the individual

13

who says sure, put the McCain sign on -- on my lawn.

14

one is going to doubt that the person whose house is

15

there is in favor of McCain; and -- and it seems to me

16

we are in the same situation with the monument in the

17

city.

18

MS. HARRIS:

Again, I think because it's a

19

public park and because public forums are always used

20

for the expression of -- of ideas that the Government

21

does not necessarily agree with -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We do not -- there is no

pervasive understanding or non-pervasive one, I would

3

have thought, in the United States that anyone who wants

4

to display a message in granite in a public park can put

5

it there.

6

if the granite monument is there, the city or whatever

7

has said, yes, we approve it, put it there.

8
9

No one assumes that.

MS. HARRIS:

Everyone assumes that,

The city in this case -

everybody may assume that, and they would be right.

The

10

city in this case did say, yes, we approve that monument

11

and not that one.

12

can't.

13

That is the First Amendment problem that the Government

14

--

15

So you can put yours up, and you

That doesn't solve the First Amendment problem.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It may create the First

16

Amendment problem, but it seems to me, going back to

17

Justice Alito's question, that the City's decision is a

18

clear adoption of the monument.

19

MS. HARRIS:

If all we have, I think,

20

Justice Souter, is that the city has permitted one

21

private speaker to erect a monument, there is no

22

constitutional or judicially manageable line between

23

that and just the ordinary thing the Government always

24

does when it grants preferred access to a public forum,

25

which is to say you're in, you're out.
50
Alderson Reporting Company

If that's enough

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for adoption, then there are no more First Amendment

2

violations through lack of equal access.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but even on your own

4

criterion, if the city passes a resolution saying we

5

adopt this, you're still -- you're going to be faced

6

with precisely the content discrimination problem that

7

you're arguing about here.

8
9

MS. HARRIS:

But because it's adopted it as

its own message, then we think the Government is

10

speaking.

11

United States, said it is entitled to make content and

12

viewpoint distinctions, but in order to do that, it has

13

to step up and speak itself.

14

for the Government speech doctrine.

15

And when the Government is speaking, as the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's the justification

You're basically just

16

arguing for a clear statement rule.

I mean, Justice

17

Alito's question, my analogies are suggestive of the

18

fact that there is an affirmative Government act of some

19

indication of approval when it says, yes, you can put

20

the monument here.

21

well, we want a clearer statement, we want it to say,

22

yes, we really adopt it, it's ours from the heart.

23

that seems to be the difference between your position

24

and the -- and the position that acceptance of the

25

monument is enough.

And what you're arguing for is,

51
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. HARRIS:

I would formulate it only

2

slightly differently, which is not so much a clear

3

statement but that those are really two different

4

things, approving it for access and adopting the message

5

as the Government's own.

And that the differences -

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, you can -

7

MS. HARRIS:

that would -

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

distinction.

--

You can make that

There's no -- I understand the distinction

10

you're making, but because I don't see that that's a

11

distinction that a reasonable member of the public would

12

understand to be implied by the -- or at least to be -

13

to be raised by the placement of the monument, I don't

14

know why it's a distinction that should be significant

15

for First Amendment purposes.

16

MS. HARRIS:

If what matters is the public

17

perception, then, yes, we do think that to clarify an

18

unclear situation like this, where have you a monument

19

that says it's presented by the Eagles, it has the

20

Eagles emblem, the Eagles are continuing to maintain it

21

in the park, and that's a fact we should assume a

22

reasonable observer would know, then, yes, be clear.

23

The Government -- there's one way to clarify that, and

24

that's for the Government to adopt it.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

And when Government adopts
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it, can it at that time specify what it understands the

2

statement to be?

3

MS. HARRIS:

I think it can, Justice Alito.

4

It can adopt -- now the Government is speaking, now this

5

is the Government's own message, and it can tailor its

6

adoption to make clear what message it's adopting.

7

And in answer to some of Justice Scalia's

8

questions, I think the Government here could put up a

9

plaque in front of the Eagles' monument that says

10

"Monument of the City of Pleasant Grove and dedicated to

11

the role that the Ten Commandments play in secular law."

12

It can do that.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Suppose the resolution of

14

adoption by the City Council just says, "The City

15

Council agrees that this monument of the Eagle

16

Association expresses an idea worthy of the public's

attention."

MS. HARRIS:

I think the -

-- or the ordinance has to do one more thing, which is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I would have thought

promote morality, partly an attempt to be civic, partly

an attempt to promote a movie.

that?

it may be a private message that has many different

suppose that there -- there are certain messages that

Uh-huh.
-- and so they say -- you

with a totally different content, "ride the roller

to get healthy children, not put children at risk.

therefore we like messages to eat vitamins, and we don't

want messages, "ride the roller coaster."

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see where you're going.

10

MS. HARRIS:

Okay.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you taking this line

12

because you say if the city council votes for it, then

13

the voters can know those people voted to put up the Ten

14

Commandments; we don't like that; so we are going to

15

vote them out?

16

that it isn't good enough for them to approve the

17

placement of the monument, but it has to be some kind of

18

formal declaration?

19

Is that -- what underlies this notion

MS. HARRIS:

What underlies it is that the

20

Government speech -- the Government speech doctrine is

21

an exception to normal First Amendment, and very

22

important First Amendment constraints.

23

underlies the distinction is that that exception is

24

justified only when the Government is speaking for

25

itself.

And what

The Government needs to be able to promote its
62
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

own messages, its own ideas.

2

that, if it's disclaiming the content of the monument,

3

saying those are not our own ideas, those are not our

4

own messages, then there is just no justification for

5

allowing it to prefer one form of private speech over

6

another.

7

is missing.

8
9

The justification for allowing that exception

JUSTICE SOUTER:
here.

But if it's not doing

But it's not disclaiming it

The Government isn't disclaiming it.

And the

10

difference it seems to me between you and your friends

11

on the other side is you want this clear statement.

12

want a statement -- for example if you took Justice

13

Scalia's statement, that would satisfy you, and it would

14

also be the poison pill in the Establishment Clause.

15

Isn't that what's -- I mean, that's okay with me.

16

don't see that as an illegitimate object.

driving this?

20

the city is a bit on the horns of a dilemma because it

21

wants to have it both ways.

22

this speech is governmental for purposes of blocking

equal access rights; but not so governmental at that

it's a big Establishment Clause problem.

think there is a dilemma here for the city.
