ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. COLEMAN:

Good morning, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

Racial classifications are inherently

12

pernicious and, if not checked, lead as they did in New

13

Haven to regrettable and socially destructive racial

14

politics.

15

Neither equal protection nor Title VII

16

justified New Haven's race-based scuttling of the

17

promotions Petitioners earned through the civil service

18

process mandated by Connecticut law.

19

required no strong evidentiary basis that the City was

20

acting to remedy or avoid any actual discrimination, but

21

strong safeguards are needed to smoke out illegitimate

22

uses of race and to extinguish the racial favoritism

23

that civil service laws -- excuse me -- are intended to

24

prevent.

25

The lower court

Governmental employment actions grounded in

divisiveness and cause race-grounded harm that the

Constitution seeks to avert.

decision?

Is it undisputed that it was a race-based

MR. COLEMAN:

No, Justice Stevens.

I think

the city makes the argument that it was not a race-based

10

decision simply because the effect of the scuttling

11

resulted in no promotions being given at all.

12

believe that that is not a basis for distinguishing

13

this.

14

We

That it still remains a race-based decision.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Are you contending that

15

that's an issue of fact that has to be tried out or that

16

we should accept your version of that -- of that issue?

17

MR. COLEMAN:

I believe that that's an issue

18

of law, Your Honor.

19

what the Court concluded in Croson.

20

argument that a do-over is not a racial classification

21

is exactly what happened in Croson.

22

declared, a -- a rebidding; and yet the Court said,

23

because that rebidding was declared for racial reasons,

24

it would nevertheless be subjected to -

25

It is no different ultimately than

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This type of an

There was a do-over

That was pursuant to -

5
Alderson Reporting Company

to an affirmative action plan, and here we're dealing

2

with this concept under Title VII of disparate impact.

3

And let's take for one example a test that's given by a

4

police department, a fire department, and it -- it's a

5

physical fitness test, and it disproportionately

6

excludes female applicants.

7

in and there are no women on the eligibility list, the

8

department reconsiders.

9

wrong with this test.

And when the results come

It thinks there is something
It can probably test for the

10

necessary skills in a way that will not achieve those

11

results.

13

similarly based on an impermissible criterion, if the

14

department said:

15

results of that test.

16

substitute another that will not have those skewed

17

results.

18

We're not going to -- we have got the
We're going to throw it out and

MR. COLEMAN:

If that decision was grounded

19

in a determination that we simply need to ensure that

20

there are more women on the force, then, yes, it would

21

be subjected to heightened scrutiny, maybe not strict

22

scrutiny under that -

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Not more women on the

24

force, but this test that we're giving has the effect of

25

excluding most women, just as the high school diploma
6
Alderson Reporting Company

1

had the effect, a disproportionate effect, on one race.

2

MR. COLEMAN:

I think your question gets to

3

part of the heart of this case, and that is, ultimately:

4

Is the decision that's being made one that is -- is

5

based in race or is -- is based on a determination that

6

there is an improper test?

7

grounded in race if -- if the police department in your

8

case had clear evidence that the test was simply

9

unnecessary, that it was not job-related and could be

But this decision is

10

clearly done by an identifiable alternative, I think at

11

the end of the day there might be some basis.

12

is grounded in -

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if it

So they would have to go

15

far as proving a Title VII disparate impact case against

16

themselves.

18

about discrimination.

19

They couldn't do anything short of that to

MR. COLEMAN:

To use the constitutional

20

analogy, Your Honor, I think Wygant, Croson, Adarand,

21

other cases, make clear that you do not have to prove

22

the violation against yourself, but you do have to

23

demonstrate that you have a strong basis in evidence for

believing you are violating the law.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The problem, Mr. Coleman,

2

is that -- that the cases you are relying on, it seems

3

to me, are cases in which ultimately what is being

4

judged is a different result in the -- at the end point

5

of the process which was starting.

6

I have with -- with using cases like that and -- and

7

essentially the problem I -- I have with your argument

is that it leaves a -- a municipality or a governmental

9

11

13

the results and go forward with it, they are inevitably

14

facing a disparate impact lawsuit.

Because on -- on the

If they stop and say, wait a minute, we're

16

starting down the road toward a disparate impact lawsuit

17

and, indeed, there may be something wrong here, they are

18

inevitably facing a disparate treatment suit.

19

whatever Congress wanted to attain, it couldn't have

20

wanted to attain that kind of a situation.

And

21

Why isn't the most reasonable reading of

MR. COLEMAN:

Under our alternative

strong basis in evidence to show that there is liability

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

My -- my question is -

-- is because minorities are better represented on the

could have happened is that some experts told them, this

18

test -- by the way, test one is -- is even worse than in

So if you admit he could do it even if the test didn't

discriminate negatively against minorities, namely

just as my physical fitness test that excluded all

MR. COLEMAN:

We're not claiming that it's a

MR. COLEMAN:

Again -- again, getting to the

11

-- the fundamental point is, the use of race is so, so

12

very important that the Court has always expressed

13

skepticism and hostility to it, and what we're saying

14

under this argument regarding a strong basis in

15

evidence, and I think this answers both your

16

hypothetical and Justice Souter's, is that what the city

17

is saying, we don't have to demonstrate a strong basis

18

in evidence for liability, we concede that we don't have

19

that; all we have is good faith.

20

That leads -

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And that's not enough.

But you are -- as I

22

understand it, you are imposing your strong basis in

23

evidence test on what you referred to a second ago as

24

the use of race, and that cannot be correct, because the

25

use of race includes race-conscious decisions which are
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not discriminatory decisions, and they certainly do not

2

implicate the -- the obligation that you want to impose.

3

You -- if -- if your argument is going to be

4

coherent with what we start with, it can't be based

5

merely on the use of race because if it does, then you

6

are, in effect, turning any race-conscious decision into

7

a discrimination decision, and that equation we

8

certainly haven't made and we're never going to make.

9
10

MR. COLEMAN:

That's not our intention,

Justice Souter.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

MR. COLEMAN:

Then -

Our argument is clearly that

13

this is not race-conscious, that it is race-based.

only determination that the city made is we don't like

15

the results of this test; there must be something

16

different that we can do; and we don't need to

But it -- it clearly is,

11

Justice Souter.

I think the distinction we're making in

part is this principle of individual dignity that the

13

Court has recognized is so strong distinguishes the

14

hypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave me from -- form

15

the example that we have in this case where they had

16

already taken the test; identifiable individuals had

earned their promotions; and then the city says too many

non-minorities passed this test, and we are going to

19

scuttle these results based on identifiable individuals

20

who have passed and not based on any -- anything

21

approaching a demonstration that there is actually any

22

disparate impact liability.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the cost of drawing the

24

distinction between this case and Justice Kennedy's

20

distinction, the only way the city can get itself out of

that Congress intended to put a city into that situation

yourself to another lawsuit which you can only win by

you prove up a claim against yourself.

But what we are saying is that the standard

cannot be so light that the City very lightly and

22

without any demonstration whatsoever that there might

23

actually be liability here, based simply on the numbers,

can say well, we're going to avoid liability and we're

JUSTICE BREYER:

What do you do if there is

7

not a liability in question?

Suppose a school district

8

deliberately, to obtain greater racial diversities in

9

the schools draws district boundaries in a particular

10

way among neighborhoods or plans a construction program.

11

Then suppose having done that, indeed having once drawn

12

the boundaries, a group comes to the school district and

13

says you can achieve greater diversity if you redraw the

14

boundary.

15

of building this school where the -- where the

foundations are laid already, you build the school over

examples really are more of -- as Justice Souter, you

were saying, the race-conscious type determination, and

3

MR. COLEMAN:

The difference that the Court,

I believe, has suggested is that that type of a

5

redrawing is likely to include a number of traditional

6

redistricting factors and that race in that instance,

7

unless it was shown to ultimately predominate, would not

make it a race -- or, excuse me, a race-based effort

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MEADE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and maybe it

20

provisions, which seek to root out barriers to equal

21

22

has a severe adverse impact such that it creates an

23

inference of discrimination, and evidence further

24

supports that inference, the employer should be granted

25

some limited degree of flexibility to act.

When an employer learns that a practice

43
Alderson Reporting Company

An employer

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

certainly should not be encouraged or forced to make a

2

promotion on the basis of the questionable practice.

3

Title VII's disparate impact provisions are

4

designed to remove structural barriers to

5

discrimination, and when an employment practice has an

6

adverse impact such that it substantiates an inference

7

of discrimination, an employer should look beyond that

8

adverse impact.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

If all the employer -

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can I ask you -

If all the employer has is

12

evidence that the test results violate the four-fifths

13

rule, is that sufficient?

14

MR. MEADE:

In our view it is not

15

sufficient, and that is not what was at issue here.

16

First of all, there was a severe adverse impact, much

17

lower than the four-fifths rule, much lower than what

18

this Court found in Connecticut v Teal, and in addition,

19

not just on the pass/fail ratio -

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if I could modify the

21

question.

Is there some statistical point at which

22

that's sufficient, if it's not four-fifths, if it's

23

nine-tenths -

24

MR. MEADE:

Our view -

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- that alone would be
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sufficient?

2

MR. MEADE:

Our view is that it might be

3

conceivable under Title VII in some cases for the

4

statistical disparity to be so severe such that it would

5

give an employer a reasonable basis under Title VII.

6

However, that's not what we argue here.

7

We argue here that an employer should be

8

able to act when it has a severe adverse impact which

9

creates an inference of discrimination, coupled with

10

evidence that creates doubts about the flaws in the test

11

or the possibility of alternatives.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can I ask you to

13

touch on the distinction between racial discrimination

14

and race-conscious action?

15

in many of our cases, in Croson and Adarand, Parents

16

Involved, Wygant, were obviously race-conscious actions;

17

there was a reason that the governments in those cases

18

were taking the action.

It was because of what they saw

19

as the impact on race.

Yet we concluded that was racial

20

discrimination.

21

line between race-conscious that's permitted and racial

22

discrimination that's not?

23

The actions that were taken

So what's the -- how do you draw the

MR. MEADE:

Well, two answers, Mr. Chief

24

Justice.

First of all, this race consciousness is race

25

consciousness that's mandated by Federal law.
45
Alderson Reporting Company

This is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not a discretionary decision by an employer.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but if we -

3

if we agree with your -- I mean, you're assuming, it

4

seems to me in your argument, that the actions that

5

they've taken here are not intentional racial

6

discrimination; and of course if they're not, then you

7

don't have much to worry about.

8

they are, as we found they were in Croson and Wygant and

9

Adarand and Parents Involved.

10

MR. MEADE:

But let's assume that

Well, the difference in those

11

cases that you talk about, Croson, Adarand, Parents

12

Involved, they involve express racial quotas -- excuse

13

me, express racial classifications, where the government

14

is making a decision based on a particular individual on

15

the basis of race.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the only reason

17

you say that isn't by an individual is that you have

18

blacked out the names?

19

MR. MEADE:

No, because it's a facially

20

neutral action which applies to all test takers the

21

same.

22

That doesn't mean CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So your position is

23

what?

They threw out the test, so you would have no

24

problem at all if they looked at those results and they

25

were predominantly black rather than white; you would
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

say the city can throw out the test and there's no

2

racial discrimination there at all?

3

MR. MEADE:

No, I would say that there's no

4

classification.

5

strict scrutiny and that comes under cases like

6

Arlington Heights and Feeney, and the action that the -

7

the facially neutral action that the city took here

8

falls under that line of cases.

9

However, there's another way to trigger

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And then -

I don't see how you can

10

call it facially neutral.

11

throw it out for the losers as well as for the winners?

12

That's neutrality?

13

MR. MEADE:

It's neutral because you

There is no classification,

14

because each individual, and -- when a particular

15

individual is looked at and a decision is made on the

16

basis of race, that is a racial classification.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If -

So this case would

18

come out differently, if the list was there with then

19

names and they go down and instead of saying throw out

20

the test, they said Jones, you don't get the promotion

21

because you're white; Johnson, you don't get it because

22

you're white.

23

everybody who took the test; then that would be all

24

right?

25

And they go down the list and throw out

MR. MEADE:

Well, the point is, if all the
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

tests are being thrown out and different decisions are

2

not being made on the basis of different individuals on

3

the basis of race, then -

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So they can keep -

5

they get do-overs until it comes out right?

6

out this test; they do another test; oh, it's just as

7

bad, throw that one out; get another one that's a little

8

better, but not so -- throw that one out?

MR. MEADE:

Well, two responses.

employer were actually to comply with Title VII or for

15

some other intent.

To answer your first question,

the question of statutory interpretation, I would

disagree with the suggestion that that gives support to

11

Congress made a careful judgment about what can and

22

disparate impact provisions suddenly disappear.

23

a number of lower courts have stated, there's no

25

discriminatory test.
59
Alderson Reporting Company

Just because a

And as

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The problem is, the alternative is to force

2

employers to go forward and to use a discriminatory or a

3

potentially discriminatory test.

That has two problems.

4

First, it's inconsistent with the goal of

5

merit-based selection; and second of all, if it turns

6

out that there is, in fact, discrimination, a court then

7

needs to undo that discrimination.

need to use racial quotas or set-asides to try to undo

9

or to remedy the discrimination that has happened.

10

A court will often

So it's much better for an employer to stop,

11

to not go forward with discrimination, even after the

12

test has been used, rather than to rush forward and to

13

create potentially further discrimination and a more

14

aggressive use of race down the road.

15

Another problem with creating a high

16

standard is it will discourage employers from removing

17

barriers to equal opportunity.

18

respect to an ongoing practice, if an employer learns

19

that that practice has a disparate impact, but is not

20

sure one way or another, and gets rid of that provision,

21

under Petitioners' theory that employer will necessarily

22

be liable to either blacks or whites.

What type of -- what

type of other things are you talking about there?

MR. MEADE:

for example, if there were a five-part training program

that the City or an employer set up, and individuals may

6

have completed some portion of the training program such

7

that there would be similar reliance interests like

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the question,

10

I guess, would be whether the program was valid or not

11

under the traditional approaches you take under Title

VII.

13
14

MR. MEADE:

Exactly.

But then the question

is whether you're forced -

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So does your

16

position here depend on a conclusion that this test is

17

invalid?

18

MR. MEADE:

No, it doesn't.

The question is

19

whether the employer had a sufficient basis at the time

20

of its action to make a determination that the test

21

should not be used.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

And why didn't it have a

23

sufficient basis here?

It -- it chose the company that

24

framed the test, and then as soon as it saw the results,

25

it decided it wasn't going to go forward with the

promotions.

The company offered to validate the test.

2

The City refused to pay for that, even though that was

3

part of its contract with the company.

4

is this testimony by a competitor, Mr. Hornick, who

5

said -- who hadn't seen the test, and he said, I could

6

do a better test -- you should make the promotions based

7

on this, but I could give you -- I could draw up a

8

better test, and by the way, here's my business card if

9

you want to hire me in the future.

And all it has

10

How's that a strong basis in the evidence?

11

MR. MEADE:

Well, first of all, the City did

12

not act on the basis of numbers alone.

It had 5 days of

13

hearings where it heard from stakeholders on all sides.

14

And it heard numerous flaws in the test at those

15

hearings.

16

For example, there were arbitrary weightings

17

of the scores which had no scientific basis; the company

18

skipped critical design steps in the process; and

19

although this was not before the board, it later turned

20

out that there was no calibration in either the cut-off

21

score or how the test was ultimately going to be used.

22

Previous tests had a much less severe adverse impact.

23

This test was an outlier.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

me that you don't have to show that the test is invalid,

your argument is you just have to show that there's a

have to show a strong basis in the evidence?

MR. MEADE:

consistent to -- to both of you, the answer is if the

However, if this Court concludes that strict

5

scrutiny applies, which we think it should not, but if

6

this Court concludes that strict scrutiny does apply,

7

then, yes, we agree -

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I guess, my -- so

my -- your position is that you should never have a

10

strong basis in fact standard, because you don't think

11

strict scrutiny should apply, and you think if it's

12

under Title VII, it's only reasonableness?

13

MR. MEADE:

That's correct.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So your position is

15

that the city -- the -- the government can take action

view of whether or not they might or might not be

liable.

It's a reasonable

And then they can engage

We agree with the government's

articulation of the standard of reasonable basis.

Again, I would -

other than the probability of or the -- the likelihood

And if -

Okay.

MR. MEADE:

No, not that they might -- might

Again, this is, just in the Title VII context,

10

so this will affect all private employers, some of which

11

will be small employers where a single human resource

12

professional will be trying to make the determination.

13

There won't be hearings as there were in this case.

14

the question is sometimes a severe prima facie case

15

could be sufficient under Title VII, not under the

16

strong basis standard, but potentially under Title VII.

17

And if a human resource professional or if an employer

18

had a belief that further investigation could yield

19

evidence of a Title VII violation, that would be

20

sufficient under the reasonable basis standard.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Isn't that -- isn't

22

that kind of a blank check to discriminate, if all they

23

need is a reasonable basis to think that further

24

investigation might be useful?

25

MR. MEADE:

No, it's not because this is a
66

Alderson Reporting Company

1

way to reconcile, under Title VII, the two provisions of

2

this statute.

3

However, in this case -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, I'm sorry -

that's an answer about why it would be okay.

saying, isn't it in fact a blank check?

No, it

is not a blank check.

alone, but it's adverse impact that creates an inference

of discrimination could be enough.

That standard would suggest that a prima

MR. COLEMAN:

There's another statute that

will not overrule and pre-empt State law unless there is

a violation of Title VII.

17

In asserting that, under any reasonable

basis, as long as they have a reasonable basis, they can

19

dispense with all the provisions of Connecticut civil

20

service law, all these provisions that were put in place

21

to get rid of cronyism, to get rid of discrimination can

22

be set aside based on nothing more than a numerical

Even if there's strong

11

evidence that it's not job-related and that there's a

12

better test that doesn't produce these skewed results?

13

MR. COLEMAN:

I don't think that's what

14

we've said, Justice Ginsburg.

formulation in which the Court recognizes -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Under our alternative

But what -- what would

17

that do to the civil service merit system that says if

18

you pass the test you should be certified?

19

MR. COLEMAN:

The difference is this,

20

Justice Ginsburg:

The example you have given would

21

clearly satisfy or likely satisfy a strong basis in

22

evidence that you are actually in violation of the

23

disparate impact provision of Title VII.

is that your test is not related; and the third is the

existence of this alternative that is equally valid and

2

that results in lower disparate impact.

3

The City has never asserted -- and I hear it

4

today continue to say, we don't have to show those other

5

two prongs, that a numerical disparity enough may allow

6

the City to conclude that there must be something wrong

7

with the test.

8

disparate impact is one that the courts have not

9

recognized and that Watson said we cannot allow because

10

it results in racial balancing and soft quotas based on

11

disparate impact -

12

This kind of res ipsa loquitur theory of

JUSTICE BREYER:

But in your -- in my

13

example, to go back, the thing you've identified, it

14

seems to me, is Texas couldn't do this.

15

look at the class that they're going to choose with the

16

10 percent and say, you know, there are not enough

17

minorities, I think we'll go to 15 percent this year.

18
19
20

MR. COLEMAN:

It couldn't

That I agree with, Justice

Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:

It could not.

And

21

moreover, in the case of the tenure, what the school

22

couldn't do is it couldn't say, looking over at the

23

present tenured faculty and those who were just ready

24

for promotion and who in all probability will be, we're

25

going to go to the non-tenure system this year.
75

We're

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

going to go to the non-tenure system this year.

2

MR. COLEMAN:

I also agree with that.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

That they couldn't do that.

4

And again you that say the ordinary employer across

5

America who announces a deadline for getting in

6

applications cannot, once it sees those applications,

7

say, you know, there are not enough minorities.

8

to extend the deadline.

9
10

MR. COLEMAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

All right.

And therefore

this is a very far-reaching decision.

13
14

That's also correct, Justice

Breyer.

11
12

I want

MR. COLEMAN:
Honor.

No, not necessarily, Your

Okay, what JUSTICE SOUTER:

You are -- you are saying,

16

as I understand it, that if the -- if the city in a case

17

like this, prior to giving a test, looked at the test

18

and says, wait a minute, this is going to produce really

19

disparate results, they can stop, regroup, and think it

20

through again and maybe come up with a different test.

21

MR. COLEMAN:

If -

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if they don't realize

23

that and they go ahead with the test, and they then see

24

the -- the disparate results, it's too late.

25

seems to me that the trouble with drawing that
76
Alderson Reporting Company

And it

distinction is that the city is not in the testing

2

business.

3

are going to be.

4

-- that is prescient can adjust, the city that doesn't

5

find out there's something wrong or at least undesirable

6

from their standpoint until after the test results

7

cannot readjust?

8
9

They are unlikely to know what the results
So you're saying that the city that is

MR. COLEMAN:

I don't think that's our

position, Justice Souter.

The first case I think is the

10

hypothetical Justice Kennedy posed to me.

11

case, as we've been talking about, is that you identify

12

the disparate impact after the test has been given.

13

Under this alternative theory that would allow a -- an

14

employer to respond, all we are asking under the strong

15

basis in evidence test is that you not react out of a

16

concern, or out of this mere reaction to the numbers,

17

but that you then look, is the test valid?

18

convincing evidence, in the words of Wygant, to form a

19

strong basis in evidence that if you did go forward -

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The second

Do you have

But if they see it coming,

21

they don't have to show a strong basis in evidence for

22

changing the test prior to the time they give it?

23

MR. COLEMAN:

Consistent with what -- my

24

conversation with Justice Breyer, if they see it coming

25

and do it ahead of time, it doesn't violate that
