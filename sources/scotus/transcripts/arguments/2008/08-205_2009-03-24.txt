CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

5

Federal Election Commission.

Mr. Olson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Participation in the political process is

12

the First Amendment's most fundamental guarantee.

13

that freedom is being smothered by one of the most

14

complicated, expensive, and incomprehensible regulatory

15

regimes ever invented by the administrative state.

16

Yet

In the case that you consider today, it is a

17

felony for a small, nonprofit corporation to offer

18

interested viewers a 90-minute political documentary

19

about a candidate for the nation's highest office, that

20

General Electric, National Public Radio, or George Soros

21

may freely broadcast.

22

theaters, sold on DVDs, transmitted for downloading on

23

the Internet, and its message may be distributed in the

24

form of a book.

25

prison if they offer it in the home through the vehicle

Its film may be shown in

But its producers face 5 years in

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of Video On Demand.

2

Because the limitation on speech, political

3

speech, is at the core of the First Amendment, the

4

government has a heavy burden to establish each

5

application of a restriction on that form of speech is a

6

narrowly tailored response to a compelling governmental

7

interest.

8

attempted to prove that a 90-minute documentary made

9

available to people who choose affirmatively to receive

The government cannot prove and has not

10

it, to opt in, by an ideologically oriented small

11

corporation poses any threat of quid pro quo corruption

12

or its appearance.

13

definition of robust, uninhibited debate about a subject

14

of intense political interest that the First Amendment

15

is there to guarantee.

16

Indeed, this documentary is the very

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Olson, if the film were

17

distributed by General Motors, would your argument be

18

the same?

19

MR. OLSON:

Well, it wouldn't -- definitely

20

would not be the same because there are several aspects

21

of the argument that we present.

22

respect, it would.

23

sort of thing that the -- the BCRA -- the Congress was

24

intended to prohibit.

25

Reporters Committee for -- for Freedom of Speech points

However, in one

A 90-minute documentary was not the

In fact, as the -- as the

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

out, the documentary is indistinguishable from other

2

news media commentary -

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the -- the point, then,

4

of similarity is you would, whether it was offered by

5

General Motors or offered by -- by this Petitioner, in

6

effect call for some qualification of the -- the general

7

rule allowing limitations on corporate political

8

activity of the speech variety?

9

MR. OLSON:

10

very important factor.

11
12

Yes, we would, although it is a

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So how would we draw the

line?

13

MR. OLSON:

Well, one of the reasons that -

14

one of the bases upon which you would draw the line is

15

to look at the documentary -- the voluminous documentary

16

record that the government cites and this Court cited in

17

the McConnell case as a justification for the

18

restrictions themselves.

19

As -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, would every -- in

20

effect, every limitation on corporate speech or on

21

corporate expenditure and the nature of speech be

22

subject, then, to in effect this all-factor balancing

23

test?

24
25

MR. OLSON:

Well, I think what I'm trying to

say is that what the -- what the Congress was concerned
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

with -- and Judge Kollar-Kotelly in the district court

2

opinion that you considered in McConnell discusses this

3

on page 646 of her opinion -- that this sort of

4

communication was not something that Congress intended

5

to prohibit.

6

prohibit 90-minutes -

7

You would look at, if Congress intended to

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So -- so your -- your

8

argument then is there's something distinct about the

9

speech, which could be considered regardless of the

10

corporate form?

11
12

MR. OLSON:
argument, yes.

13

Well, that's part of our

It's not -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If that is the case, what

14

is -- what is the answer to this?

15

going to involve a -- a fairly complicated set of

16

analyses, probably in a lot of cases.

17

necessary or worthwhile to preserve First Amendment

18

values when you could have done this with a PAC?

19

MR. OLSON:

That -- that still is

Why is that

Well, as this Court said in the

20

Wisconsin Right to Life case just a couple years ago,

21

that the PAC vehicle is burdensome and difficult.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's right.

You've got

23

reporting.

You've got limitations on -- on corporate

24

contributions and so on, but in this case, for example,

25

most of your contributions, as I understand from the
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

record, were individual.

2

was one perhaps.

3

--

4

They weren't corporate.

There

There was some corporate contributions

MR. OLSON:

Yes, on page 252 of the appendix

5

and 251, it points out -- you're absolutely correct -

6

that 1 percent of the contributions -

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

8

MR. OLSON:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- were from corporations.
Was that -- was that

10

established?

11

of the contributors to this film.

12

something like $200,000 accounted for, and the film cost

13

-- to get the Channel '08, whatever it was, to put it on

14

cost over a million dollars?

15

I thought that the record was hardly made

MR. OLSON:

I think there was

The government sent an

16

interrogatory, Justice Ginsburg, asking for the major

17

contributions with respect to this project, and the ones

18

that they sought -- the government sought what they

19

thought was important; the answer to that interrogatory

20

is at page 251a and 252a -- that the government was

21

seeking information with respect to contributions at a

22

$1,000 or more; 198,000 came from individuals.

23

the way, the three largest contributors that are listed

24

on page 252 of the Joint Appendix are given credit in

25

the film itself.

And, by

So there's no effort to -- to conceal
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

those individuals.

2

So that it's possible -- it's possible that

3

corporations throughout America were giving small

4

amounts of money to this.

5

one way or the other.

6

the government felt was necessary for its case that the

7

major contributors were individuals and not

8

corporations.

9

That record doesn't establish

What it does establish is what

JUSTICE BREYER:

You have answered Justice

10

Souter.

I took your answer to be the following:

11

if the corporation had paid -- paid for a program and

12

the program was 90 minutes which said vote for Smith,

13

vote for Smith over and over -- that's the program -

14

that you concede that the government could ban this

15

under the Act.

16

MR. OLSON:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

That

Well, it is difficult I don't think they would.

18

We agree.

19

fact, if they did have 90 minutes of vote for Smith or

20

vote against Jones, you concede for purposes of this

21

argument that the government can ban it.

22

or not?

23

It's an imaginary hypothetical.

MR. OLSON:

But, in

Is that bright

If -- not by this organization.

24

We think that if it's a small, nonprofit organization,

25

which is very much like the Massachusetts 8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay, okay.

So one of your

2

arguments is this is a special corporation.

3

Now suppose it's General Motors.

4
5

MR. OLSON:

Can they?

Well, General Motors may be

smaller than the client that we are representing.

6

(Laughter.)

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

You can't.

I would just like to get --

I want to get an answer to the question.

9

MR. OLSON:

10

Yes, I think that's a big step.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Now, in my question

11

that I'm driving towards is:

Since General Motors can

12

in your view be forbidden to have our film of 90 minutes

13

vote for Smith, vote for Smith, vote for Smith, or vote

14

against Jones, vote against Jones, vote against Jones,

15

how is this film, which I saw -- it is not a musical

16

comedy.

What -

17

(Laughter.)

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

What -- how does this film

19

vary from my example, and why does the variance make a

20

difference?

21

MR. OLSON:

The difference is:

It's exactly

22

what the Court was describing in Wisconsin Right To

23

Life.

24

which is what the Court said, or the Chief Justice's

25

opinion, the controlling opinion said, was the mark of

It is a 90 -- it is -- it informs and educates,

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

an issue communication.

2

And as this Court said -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Olson, I thought you

3

conceded in the -- at least as I read your reply brief,

4

that you were no longer saying this is about an issue

5

unrelated to any election.

6

was a 90-minute movie "concerning the qualifications,

7

character, and fitness of a candidate for the Nation's

8

highest office."

And that's just what Wisconsin Right

9

to Life was not.

It was not about the character,

10

I thought you said that this

qualifications, and fitness of either of the Senators.

11

MR. OLSON:

What the -- what the Court said

12

in Wisconsin Right to Life was that the distinction

13

between an issue -- issue advocacy and campaign advocacy

14

dissolves upon practical application.

15

what the Court was talking about there.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This is exactly
And -

But didn't the Court

17

there say this is not about character, qualifications,

18

and fitness?

19

MR. OLSON:

Yes, it did, Justice Ginsburg,

20

but what my point is:

That there isn't just two boxes

21

in the world of communications about public issues, one

22

box for so-called issues and one box for campaign

23

advocacy.

24

said, not just in Wisconsin Right to Life but in earlier

25

cases, that the distinction dissolves upon application.

That's what I think the Court meant when it

10
Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- how many boxes we have?

2

Doesn't this one fall into campaign advocacy?

3

I've got the government's brief open at -- open at pages

4

18 and 19 with the quotations:

5

anything.

6

dishonest, do anything for power, will speak

7

dishonestly, reckless, a congenital liar, sorely lacking

8

in qualifications, not qualified as commander in chief.

9

I mean, this sounds to me like campaign advocacy.

10

She is deceitful.

MR. OLSON:

I mean

She will lie about
She is ruthless, cunning,

It -- what -- what the court was

11

talking about and as Justice Kollar-Kotelly talked about

12

is broadcast advertising, these 10-minute -- 10-second,

13

30-second, 60-second bursts of communication that are -

14

that are the influence in elections.

15
16
17

JUSTICE BREYER:

I want to get the answer to

what I was asking.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it -- it seems to me,

18

the answer to Justice Breyer's question:

19

don't vote for Jones.

20

MR. OLSON:

This is a

This is a long discussion of the

21

record, qualifications, history, and conduct of someone

22

who is in the political arena, a person who already

23

holds public office, who now holds a different public

24

office, who, yes, at that point, Justice Souter, was

25

running for office.

But the fact is that what could the
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

individual making a -- as I said, the Reporters

2

Committee for the Right to Life said this is

3

indistinguishable from something that is on the public

4

media every day, a long discussion.

5

you're suggesting is that unless it's somehow

6

evenhanded, unless it somehow says -- which would be

7

viewpoint discrimination or prevention of viewpoints,

8

which is the safe harbor that the government has written

9

into its so-called safe harbor, if you don't have a

10
11

It might be -- what

point of view, you can go ahead and express it.
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, that isn't -- that

12

isn't the suggestion.

13

trying to get to, is we know you can't just say vote

14

against Smith, vote against Smith, vote against Smith.

15

Now, I wanted to know the difference between that and a

16

film that picks out bad things that people did -- no

17

good ones, just bad ones the candidate did.

18

have another film that picks out just good things

19

candidates do.

20

the good things they do, and then someone else shows the

21

bad things they do.

22

The suggestion I was going to, or

And then we

against Smith?

So we're after electioneering.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Why

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

doesn't that fall within the forbidden category?

2

MR. OLSON:

The government has the burden to

3

prove -- and there's a compelling governmental interest

4

narrowly tailored, Justice Breyer, because all kinds of

5

things of the type that you're talking about are

6

permissible if your name is General Motors -- I, mean if

7

your name is General Electric rather than General

8

Motors, if your name is Disney, if your name is George

9

Soros, if your name is National Public Radio.

10

What you're suggesting is that a long

11

discussion of facts, record, history, interviews,

12

documentation, and that sort of thing, if it's all

13

negative, it can be prohibited by -- and it's a felony.

14

You can go to jail for 5 years for sharing that

15

information with the American public, or if it's all

16

favorable, you can go to jail.

17

half, you couldn't.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

But if you did half and

I -- I guess it's the same

19

as if you were to say, you know, I think Smith is a

20

great guy.

21

what I don't see is if you agree that we could ban the

22

commercial that says, I see Smith is a great guy, why is

23

it any different to supplement that with the five best

24

things that Smith ever did?

25

That's all.

If we concede -- and at the end of the day

10

beginning point, that a short, 30-second, 1-minute

11

campaign ad can be regulated, you want me to write an

12

opinion and say, well, if it's 90 minutes, then that's

13

different.

14

argument that 90 -- that 90 minutes is much more

15

powerful in support or in opposition to a candidate.

16

That's I -- that's the thrust of the questioning.

17

I -- it seems to me that you can make the

MR. OLSON:

I understand that, Justice

18

Kennedy, and it is difficult.

But let me say that the

19

record that you were considering in McConnell -- and I

20

specifically invite, as I did before, page -- the

21

Court's attention to 646 of this -- of the district

22

court's opinion, which specifically said the government

23

and Congress was concerned about these short, punchy ads

24

that you have no choice about seeing, and not concerned

25

about a thorough recitation of facts or things that you
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would have to make an affirmative decision to opt into.

2

And the reason why it's difficult is that we

are talking about an infinite variety of ability of

4

people to speak about things that matter more to them

5

than anything else, who will be -

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I think you

have kind of shifted your focus here from the difference

8

between a 10-second ad and a 90-minute presentation and

9

how that presentation is received, whether it's over the

10

normal airwaves or on this Video On Demand.

11

what is the distinction between the 10-second commercial

12

and, say, the 90-minute infomercial?

13

MR. OLSON:

What -

The thing that I think it's -

14

it's pointed out specifically in your opinion,

the things that were most potentially corruptive.

10

What Congress was trying to do has nothing to do, it

11

seems to me, with the constitutional point you're

12

arguing.

13

MR. OLSON:

The government makes the point

14

that it established a voluminous record of evidence.

15

Both Congress had before it and this Court had before it

16

a voluminous volume of evidence because it had the

17

burden of proving that something was really bad with

18

these -- these types of advertisements.

19

And what the -- what the Court did is say,

20

well, okay -- in McConnell -- yes, there is a

21

substantial burden that the government met that these

22

types of communications -- not the Internet, not books,

23

not other types of things -- are really bad enough that

24

the government could pick those out, and it has narrowly

So you're making a

I'm making a You're saying that this -

this isn't covered by it.
MR. OLSON:

Yes, I am making a statutory

10

argument in the sense that you will construe the statute

11

in the ways that doesn't violate the Constitution.

12

Constitution, as -- as the Court said in Wisconsin Right

13

to Life, gives ties to the speaker, errs on the side of

14

permitting the speech, not prohibiting the speech.

15

so all those things may be statutory arguments, Justice

16

Scalia, but they are also constitutional arguments.

The

And in response to every one of these

18

questions, the government has the burden of proving this

19

sort of speech, which the Reporters say is

20

indistinguishable, than the kind of information that

21

news media puts out all the time, not -

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So this argument

23

doesn't depend upon whether this is properly

24

characterized as express -- the functional equivalent of

25

express advocacy?

Your contention is that even if it
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is, that because it wasn't in the factual record in

2

McConnell or before Congress, it is a type of functional

3

-- it is a type of express advocacy that's not covered

4

by the Act?

5

MR. OLSON:

I don't think, Chief Justice

6

Roberts, that it is remotely the functional equivalent

7

of express advocacy, because what the Court and Congress

8

was thinking about with respect to express advocacy was

9

short, punchy things that you have no -

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's -

11

that's why I'm trying to figure out, the distinction in

12

your argument.

13

functional equivalent of express advocacy, are you

14

contending that it is nonetheless not covered in light

15

of the record before the Court in McConnell and before

16

Congress?

17

I mean, if we think that this is the

MR. OLSON:

I -- I think I would agree with

18

that, but I would also say that the -- the idea, the

19

functional equivalent of express advocacy is the very

20

magic word problem that this Court has struggled with in

21

McConnell and in -- in each of the cases.

22

I would -- I said at the beginning that this

23

is an incomprehensible prohibition, and I -- and my -- I

24

think that's demonstrated by the fact that since 2003

25

this Court has issued something close to 500 pages of
18

I think this presents a much

easier issue, Justice Stevens, because this is the type

17

of -- if there is anything that the First Amendment is

18

intended to protect in the context of elections that are

19

occurring -- which, by the way, occur 4 years running,

But it was -- it was an analysis of the

background record and history and qualifications of

3

someone running for president, of course I concede that.

4

But what is the -- what is the maker of a movie to take

5

out in order to prevent that from happening?

6

I understand from some of the questions that

7

if it was more evenhanded -- if it said, well, this

8

candidate did this, but this candidate did this or this

9

candidate was born in the Panama Canal Zone and this

10

candidate was born in Hawaii, and that affects whether

11

or not they are natural-born citizens or not, and it was

12

more evenhanded, would that then not be a felony?

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

As you -- as you've said

14

yourself, as you pointed out, there -- there is a point

15

at which there is no nonporous border between issue

16

discussion and candidate discussion.

17

the problem that -- that Justice Ginsburg is having, I'm

18

having, and others is that it does not seem to me that

with the quotations we're dealing with here, as Justice

20

Breyer said, it's not a musical comedy.

21

we have no choice, really, but to say this is not issue

advocacy; this is express advocacy saying don't vote for

23

24
25

But I think the -

I think we -

And if that is a fair characterization, the
difference between 90 minutes and 1 minute, either for

statutory purposes or constitutional purposes, is a

2

distinction that I just cannot follow.

3

MR. OLSON:

Well, it is a distinction that

4

Congress was concerned about, and it's a distinction

5

that's all over the record -

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You say that.

Why -

7

what -- what is your basis for saying that Congress is

8

-- is less concerned with 90 minutes of don't vote for

9

Clinton than it was with 60 seconds of don't vote?

10

MR. OLSON:

Because -- because the record in

11

Congress and the record in this Court is that those

12

types of advertisements were more effective because they

13

came into your home -

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They are the characteristic

15

advertisement.

16

is the paradigm case.

17

see how you -- you then leap-frog from saying -- from

18

saying that is the paradigm case to saying that this

19

never covers anything but the paradigm case when the

20

only distinction is time.

21

There is no question about that.

MR. OLSON:

I agree with you.

But I don't

The -- the -- I think the -

what -- what Congress was concerned about is the most

severe and the most acute problem, as Justice

to the extent that you can't figure out how evenhanded

you must be or what you must take out of your

communication in order not to go to jail for airing it,

7

it is the functional equivalent -- if everything is the

8

functional equivalent that mentions a candidate during

9

an election, which is what the government says, it's the

10

functional equivalent of a prior restraint, because you

don't dare -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Olson, I -- I think

we've been led astray by -- by the constant reference to

what Congress intended.

15

was not -- it was not that, well, one is covered by the

16

statute and the other isn't, but it is that one is

covered by the Constitution and the other isn't.

may well be that -- that the kind of speech that is

10

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The lead opinion in Wisconsin Right to Life

11

didn't just use the term "functional equivalent of

12

express advocacy"; it explained what that term meant,

13

and on page 2667 of volume 127 of the Supreme Court

14

Reporter, the plurality or the lead opinion stated:

15

light of these considerations, a Court should find that

16

an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy

17

only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable

18

interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or

19

against a specific candidate."

"In

So the functional equivalence test doesn't

depend on the length of the advertisement or the medium

22

in which the advertisement -

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the length of

24

the advertisements wasn't remotely at issue in either

25

Washington Right to Life or McConnell or before Congress
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

when they passed this law.

2

MR. STEWART:

Well, certainly Congress

3

considered a variety of evidence bearing on campaign

4

practices that had been undertaken in the past.

5

were primarily -- most of the examples on which they

6

focused were 30-second and 60-second advertisements.

7

had certainly been a recurring phenomenon in the past

8

that candidates would air, for instance, 30-minute

9

infomercials.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They

It

Any discussion

11

either in McConnell -- any citation either in McConnell

12

or the Congressional Record to those types of

13

documentaries?

14

MR. STEWART:

I'm not sure about the

15

citation; I'm not aware of any citation in McConnell or

16

the Congressional Record, but it was certainly a known

17

phenomenon.

18

And I think the real CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I mean, how do

19

we know it was a known phenomenon in terms of the

20

evolution of the statute and the decision of this Court

21

upholding it?

22

There is no reference to it.

MR. STEWART:

Well, the real -- I think the

23

real key to ascertaining Congress's intent is to look to

24

the definition of electioneering communication that

25

Congress enacted into the statute, and that definition
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

requires that the communication be a broadcast, cable or

2

satellite communication in order to qualify as an

3

electioneering communication, and that it be aired

4

within a certain proximity to a Federal election, and

5

that in the case of an -

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so if Wal-Mart

7

airs an advertisement that says we have candidate action

8

figures for sale, come buy them, that counts as an

9

electioneering communication?

10

MR. STEWART:

If it's aired in the right

11

place at the right time, that would be covered.

12

under this Court's decision in Wisconsin Right to Life

13

it would be unconstitutional as applied to those

14

advertisements, because those advertisements certainly

15

would be susceptible of a reasonable construction of the

16

Constitution.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now,

Do you think the

18

Constitution required Congress to draw the line where it

19

did, limiting this to broadcast and cable and so forth?

20

What's your answer to Mr. Olson's point that there isn't

21

any constitutional difference between the distribution

22

of this movie on video demand and providing access on

23

the Internet, providing DVDs, either through a

24

commercial service or maybe in a public library,

25

providing the same thing in a book?
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Would the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Constitution permit the restriction of all of those as

3

MR. STEWART:

I think the -- the

electioneering communication restrictions to the extent

6

that they were otherwise constitutional under Wisconsin

Right to Life.

Those could have been applied to
And it's worth remembering

10

restrictions on corporate electioneering which have been

11

limited by this Court's decisions to express advocacy.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's pretty incredible.

13

You think that if -- if a book was published, a campaign

14

biography that was the functional equivalent of express

15

advocacy, that could be banned?

16

MR. STEWART:

I'm not saying it could be

17

banned.

I'm saying that Congress could prohibit the use

18

of corporate treasury funds and could require a

19

corporation to publish it using its -

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, most publishers are

21

corporations.

22

could be prohibited from selling a book?

23

The government's position is that the

MR. STEWART:

would be a potential argument that media corporations,

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just to make it clear,

it's the government's position that under the statute,

3

if this kindle device where you can read a book which is

4

campaign advocacy, within the 60-30 day period, if it

5

comes from a satellite, it's under -- it can be

6

prohibited under the Constitution and perhaps under this

8

MR. STEWART:

It -- it can't be prohibited,

9

but a corporation could be barred from using its general

10

treasury funds to publish the book and could be required

11

to use -- to raise funds to publish the book using its

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If it has one name,

one use of the candidate's name, it would be covered,

10

the outset, for instance, Hillary Clinton's election

11

would be a disaster for this -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Take my

hypothetical.

14

-- here is -- whatever it is, this is a discussion of

15

the American political system, and at the end it says

17

It doesn't say at the outset.

MR. STEWART:

Yes, our position would be

18

that the corporation could be required to use PAC funds

And they can make a determination of how

8

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

If that's

10

correct, then I take it the interesting question here

11

would be -- I don't know if it arises in this case -

12

suppose there were a kind of campaign literature or -

13

or advocacy that either a corporation had to pay for it,

14

it couldn't pay for it through the PAC, because for some

15

reason -- I don't know, the PAC -- and there's no other

16

way of getting it to the public -- that would raise a

17

Constitutional question, wouldn't it?

18

MR. STEWART:
Constitutional -

21
22

It would raise a

JUSTICE BREYER:

case?
MR. STEWART:

It's not present in this case.

23

I don't think it would raise a difficult constitutional

24

question because presumably if the reason the

25

corporation couldn't do it through the PAC -- the only
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reason I could think of is that it couldn't find

2

PAC-eligible donors who were willing to contribute for

3

this speech.

4

would -- could still be forbidden to use its general

5

treasury.

6

And if that's the case, the corporation

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't know about that.

7

But I guess I would be worried if in fact there was some

8

material that couldn't get through to the public.

9

would be very worried.

But I don't think I have to

10

worry about that in this case, do I?

11

MR. STEWART:

That's correct, both because

12

the question isn't presented here and because

13

Congress -

14

I

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but if we accept

15

your constitutional argument, we're establishing a

16

precedent that you yourself say would extend to banning

17

the book, assuming a particular person pays for it.

18

MR. STEWART:

I think the Court has already

19

held in, both in Austin and in McConnell, that Congress

20

can or that Congress or State legislatures can prohibit

21

the use of corporate treasury funds for express

22

advocacy.

the communication was not a book, but it was a

2

newsletter, it was written material; and the Court held

this was express advocacy for which the use of corporate

5

because of the distinctive characteristics of the

entitled to a constitutional exemption.

8

clear thrust of MCFL is that the publication and

so and so.

prohibition of that would be constitutional?

16

Under your theory of the Constitution, the

MR. STEWART:

Again, I do want to make clear

that if by prohibition you mean ban on the use of

question this Court would potentially need to decide in

I wanted to return for a second, Justice

38
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it's certainly true that -- that a growing number of

2

people are coming to experience those media as

3

essentially interchangeable, but there are still a lot

4

of people either who don't have computers at all or who

5

use their televisions and their computers for

6

fundamentally different purposes.

7

evident that Citizens United perceived the two media to

8

be distinct because it was willing to pay $1.2 million

9

to a cable service in order to have the film made

And I think it's

10

available on -- by Video On Demand, when Citizens United

11

could have posted the film on its own Web site, posted

12

the film on YouTube and could have avoided both the need

13

to make the payment and the potential applicability of

14

the electioneering communications provisions.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

If they had done either of

16

the things you just mentioned, putting it on its Web

17

site or putting it on YouTube, your position would be

18

that the Constitution would permit the prohibition of

that during the period prior to the primary or the

20

election?

21

MR. STEWART:

Our position is not that the

22

Constitution would permit it.

23

25

Our position is that BCRA

Now JUSTICE ALITO:

Would the Constitution -- if
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- if BCRA -- if Congress in the next act covered that

2

in light of advances in the Internet, would the

3

Constitution permit that?

4

MR. STEWART:

Yes, I mean, the Court in

5

McConnell upheld on the electioneering communications on

6

their face, and this Court -- a majority of this Court

7

in Wisconsin Right to Life said those provisions are

8

constitutional as applied -

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I'm a little

10

disoriented here, Mr. Stewart.

We are dealing with a

11

constitutional provision, are we not, the one that I

12

remember which says Congress shall make no law abridging

13

the freedom of the press?

14

interpreting here?

That's what we're

15

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. STEWART:

Okay.

But, again, this -- the Court

18

obviously has grappled in the past with the question of

19

how to apply that provision to use of corporate treasury

20

funds either for express electoral advocacy or its

21

functional equivalent -

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In -- in this case, Mr.

23

Stewart, I take it -- correct me if I'm wrong -- that

24

you think the distinction the Petitioner draws between

25

the 90-minute film and the -- and the short 30-second or
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

1-minute ad is a baseless distinction?

2

MR. STEWART:

It is of no constitutional

3

significance.

Congress certainly could have drafted the

4

electioneering communication definition.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So if -- if we think that

6

the application of this to a 90-minute film is

7

unconstitutional, then the whole statute should fall

8

under your view -

9

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think -

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

distinction between the two?

12

MR. STEWART:

-- because there's no

Well, I think the Court has

13

twice upheld the statute as applied to communications

14

that are the functional equivalent of express advocacy.

15

So -

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I'm -- I'm saying if

17

we -- if we think that this is -- that this film is

18

protected, and you say there's no difference between the

19

film and the ad, then the whole statute must be declared

20

--

21

MR. STEWART:

It would depend on the ground

22

under which you reached the conclusion that the film was

23

protected.

24

said there is a constitutional difference between

25

90-minute films and 60-second advertisements, then

If you disagreed with our submission and

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

obviously you could draw that constitutional line.

2

you concluded that they're all the same but they're all

3

protected, then obviously we would lose both cases.

4

But, again, you would have to -

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

they're both the same?

7

they're both the same.

8
9

MR. STEWART:

If

But you want us to say

You want -- you argue that

That's correct.

Now, it may

be the case -- it may be rarer to find a 90-minute film

10

that is so unrelenting in its praise or criticism of a

11

particular candidate that it will be subject to no

12

reasonable interpretation other than to vote for or

13

against that person, but when you have that, as I think

14

we do here, there's no constitutional distinction

15

between the 90-minute film and the 60-second

16

advertisement.

17

And we would stress with respect to the film

18

that what makes this, in our view, an easy case is not

19

simply that the film repeatedly criticizes Hillary

20

Clinton's character and integrity.

21

the film repeatedly links Senator Clinton's purported

22

character flaws to her qualifications for president.

opaque that they won't constitute the functional

But I think

Mr. Stewart, do you think

4

that there's a possibility that the First Amendment

5

interest is greater when what the government is trying

6

to stifle is not just a speaker who wants to say

7

something but also a hearer who wants to hear what the

8

speaker has to say?

9

I mean what is somewhat different about this

10

case is that unlike over-the-air television you have a

11

situation where you only get this -- this message would

12

only air -- if somebody elects to hear it.

13

really have two interested people, the speaker and the

14

listener who wants to -- who wants to get this.

15

So you

Isn't that a somewhat heightened First

16

Amendment interest than just over-the-air broadcasting

17

of advertising which probably most listeners don't want

18

to hear?

19

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think -- I think the

20

-- first of all, I think if we had tried to make the

21

argument in McConnell that the BCRA provisions -- or -

22

or in any other case that the BCRA provisions are

23

constitutional as applied to 30- or 60-second

24

advertisements because they are defensible means of

25

protecting listeners who, by hypothesis, don't want to
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hear the message in the form of a captive audience, I

2

don't think we would have gotten very far.

3

I think it's certainly true that people have

4

a wide variation of attitudes towards campaign

5

advertisements.

6

of course, they can hit the mute button or -- or leave

7

the room, or in the case of people who use TiVo or VCRs

8

can simply fast-forward through them.

9

Some of them find them irritating, and,

But the whole premise of the congressional

10

regulation and the whole premise of the corporations'

11

willingness to spend these massive amounts of money was

12

that enough people will be interested in the

13

advertisements that they will ultimately have an

14

electoral effect.

15

the film to the advertisement, the advertisements in one

16

sense you could say are a less effective mechanism

17

because a lot of the people who reach them are unwilling

18

listeners or uninterested.

19

they're more effective because they reach more people.

20

And -- and so if you compare the-

But, on the other hand,

The -- the flip side is that with a film you

reach a smaller audience.

It is certainly a more

limited group of people who will sign up to receive the

It seems unlikely that

communications that Citizens United has engaged in.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That doesn't work,

because maybe they are going to change the nature of the

MR. STEWART:

would be to say that disclosure requirements are

categorically unconstitutional, which would be an

18

extreme departure from this Court's prior precedents or

MR. STEWART:

I mean, it would depend to

some extent on the characteristics of the ad.

Probably

10

not, but I think if the alternative -- the two

11

alternatives to the approach that the Court has taken

previously would be first to say these requirements are

unconstitutional across the board; or the Court could

14

say as applied to organizations that engage in

that might seem more likely to subject its proponents to

reprisal, the disclosure requirements are categorically

18

unconstitutional there.

I think that would be itself an anomalous
