CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

Unifed School District v. Redding.

Mr. Wright.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W. WRIGHT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. WRIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
The search of Savana Redding in this case

12

was constitutional because Mr. Wilson had reason to

13

suspect that she possessed contraband which posed a

14

health and safety risk.

15

where she might be reasonably hiding that contraband was

16

constitutionally permissible.

17

Therefore, searching any place

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Any place, even

18

though he had perhaps no reasonable suspicion to suspect

19

that she was hiding the contraband in her underwear?

20

MR. WRIGHT:

Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice,

21

as long as he had reason to suspect, which we believe

22

the evidence does show, he was entitled to search any

23

place where the contraband might be reasonably hidden.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Any place?

I mean,

prison inmates, for example, are subject to much more

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

intrusive searches.

2

been justified in this case?

3

Are you suggesting that would have

MR. WRIGHT:

No, Your Honor.

I'm -- I'm

4

suggesting that where it might be reasonably hidden is

5

based on an administrator's experience and certainly is

6

proven out by the reported cases that we've cite in the

7

reply on pages 8 and 9, which are that students often

8

will secrete items in and under their clothing.

9

not an uncommon thing to happen, although these kind of

10

That is

intrusive searches are rare.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

really caught in -- in a dilemma here.

13

suggests that you would not have allowed a cavity search

14

in this case.

15

MR. WRIGHT:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But I -- I think you're
Your answer

That's correct, Your Honor.
But people have been known

17

to secrete contraband in -- in bodily cavities.

18

the -- what is the principle under which you would allow

19

a strip search but disallow a cavity search?

20

MR. WRIGHT:

What is

The principle is, Your Honor,

21

is that the common experience with schoolchildren, as -

22

as school officials have a relation to schoolchildren,

23

is such that they might hide things, and they do hide

24

things, in and under their clothing.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Was there -

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. WRIGHT:

But -

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Was there prior

3

experience in this particular school?

4

occasions on which students had been strip-searched and

5

contraband found?

6

MR. WRIGHT:

Were there prior

Your Honor, I don't know, and

7

that's not in the record, but I can tell that you that

8

that would not be the threshold requirement under this

9

Court's prior rulings to justify the search.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you -- I thought your

11

answer to Justice Scalia was that in the -- in the

12

school's experience, children do hide contraband in

13

their underwear but not in their body cavities.

14

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, Your Honor.

To be more

15

specific, in the nationwide school experience, based on

16

the reported cases that we see, which are contained in

17

the reply at pages 8 and 9, we find that they hide them

18

in and under clothing, but I don't know of any case of

19

which I'm aware where there would be items secreted in

20

body cavities.

21

And I -- and I feel, Your Honor, that that

22

is a bright-line area because that -- that is -- that is

23

something that the Court can clearly say is off limits.

24

And -

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Let me ask you about
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

another bright-line rule that I think you're assuming.

2

You -- you said in the course of describing the

3

justification for this search that one -- one of the

4

points of justification was that there was a health and

5

safety risk.

6

you are grouping every drug, prescription or over the

7

counter, as posing a health and safety risk; is that

8

correct?

9
10

And I assume from the way you put it that

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why -- why should we accept

11

that -- that blanket assumption?

12

it gets silly.

13

not present a health and safety risk, and yet that's an

14

over-the-counter drug, and presumably you would have

15

gone through the same search for -- for an aspirin that

16

was conducted here.

17

I mean, at some point

Having -- having an aspirin tablet does

MR. WRIGHT:

For the very same reasons this

18

Court noted in T.L.O. 25 years ago, Your Honor, and that

19

is that the school officials have deemed, in their

20

judgment, that this is an important rule with regard to

21

health and safety.

22

So -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Oh, and I agree with you,

23

and I -- I don't have any question with this kind of a,

24

let's say, a -- a broad swath of judicial hands-off in

25

determining what is a risk and what isn't.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

But at some

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

point it becomes sufficiently questionable that I do

2

think we have to raise it.

3

criminalize -- I shouldn't say "criminalize" -- would

4

put aspirin in the contraband category and justify the

5

kind of search that went on here, I think we've reached

6

the questionable point.

7

is, why haven't we?

8
9

MR. WRIGHT:

And if your rule would

And I -- my question to you now

Well, Your Honor, if -- if an

administrator in their judgment, in their reasonable

10

judgment, believes that any -- any drug poses a

11

potential health and safety risk, because they have the

12

custodial and tutelary responsibilities for those kids

13

-- and it's not like a criminal issue where they're

14

trying to prosecute; this is a case where they're trying

15

to protect -- because they have those kinds of

16

obligations to provide for the safety of children, to

17

provide an orderly educational environment, it is best

18

for this Court to defer to their judgment when they

19

believe that certain rules are important and not

20

second-guess those rules.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. WRIGHT:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Had it been -

So long Had it been the case that,

24

as I recall, someone had -- well, students were popping

25

ibuprofen, weren't they?
7
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess they might pop

3

aspirin as well.

I'm not aware that one gets a high on

4

either one of those.

5

6

Somebody in -- in the school had

On a prescription medication

that -

11
12

Precisely, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

A prescription, not over

the-counter.

13

MR. WRIGHT:

-- that a student brought to

14

school and that a student ingested, another student

15

ingested, and then was airlifted out in an ICU in a

16

near-fatal experience.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

MR. WRIGHT:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

MR. WRIGHT:

22

it's not in the record.

25

But just 7 days What was -- what was the

drug involved in that case?

21

24

What was -

I don't know, Your Honor, and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it certainly was not

ibuprofen?
MR. WRIGHT:

Again, I don't know, Your
8

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Honor.

2
3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You said it was a

prescription drug.

4

MR. WRIGHT:

It was a prescription drug.

5

And -- and 7 days before this event, Your Honor, just 7

6

days before, the student informant Romero had taken a

7

prescription drug.

8

drug was, but he became violently ill, which caused he

9

and his mother to come talk to the administrator.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

Yes, but he -- he was not

the one who identified Redding.

13
14

So we

had those two recent events.

11
12

Again, I don't know what the type of

MR. WRIGHT:

It was her classmate.

Her friend Marissa Glines, yes,

Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And on that classmate's

16

say-so -- was the classmate ever asked, well, when did

17

you get this pill?

18
19

Where did she give it to you?

MR. WRIGHT:

Where -- the question, where

did this pill come from, was asked by the administrator.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

mean, the child is caught with the pills.

22

on her classmate.

23

the school ever bother to ask when in time she gave

24

them, where in location she gave them?

25

She says:

MR. WRIGHT:

I mean, what place.

I

She blames it

She gave them to me.

Did

No, but that's clear from the
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

record, Your Honor.

2

Romero said to Mr. Wilson that morning:

3

this pill from Marissa Glines.

4

of these kids are going to take these pills at noon.

5

it's contemporaneous.

6

The reason for that is Jordan

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I just received

The plan is that a group
So

But it's contemporaneous

7

with the -- with the student who blamed the other child.

8

I'm asking if there's any link other than one child

9

caught with the pills blurts out that it was someone

10

else?

The tip from the young man had nothing to do with

11

Redding; it had to do with Glines.

12

MR. WRIGHT:

But the tip from the young man

13

goes to Glines, and the young man's tip becomes reliable

14

when Glines produces the fistful of pills that he said

15

she would have, plus other pills.

16
17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Maybe it becomes reliable

as to her, but it has nothing to do with Redding.

18

MR. WRIGHT:

But, Your Honor, then it ties

19

in with the -- with the contraband -- excuse me -- the

20

planner that was laid open before Mr. Wilson when he

21

subsequently searches Savana Redding, and she admits to

22

him that that was her planner, but she denies any

23

knowledge of the contents.

24

--

25

So did Marissa Glines.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So

Did the school know what -

10

what particular pills it was searching for?

2

MR. WRIGHT:

Not -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did it know that -- what -

4

what the threat was was ibuprofen or aspirin or -- or

5

some prescription drug?

6

MR. WRIGHT:

Not comprehensively, Your

7

Honor.

What they knew was there was IBU 400s in an OTC

8

pill that was later identified.

9

was a variety of pills.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Have you ever made -- has

2

your side of the case ever made the argument that it

3

needs this sort of blanket classification rule, any drug

4

over the counter or prescription, because when a, a pill

5

is found, they're not pharmacists, they don't know what

6

it is, and therefore they've got to have a blanket rule

We have

the school nurse -- the pills were given to the school

nurse and she identified what they were.

6

MR. WRIGHT:

Precisely.

And she called

poison control to figure that out, though, Your Honor.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Mr. Wright, could I ask

8

you this question.

There may be an issue as to what the

9

assistant principal could reasonably infer from the

10

facts that were known by him, whether he could

11

reasonably infer facts that would create a reasonable

12

suspicion that there were drugs hidden in the

13

plaintiff's undergarments.

14

for the finder of fact in a case like this, so that it

15

can't be -- there can't be summary judgment for either

16

side unless no reasonable factfinder could find to the

17

contrary?

18

MR. WRIGHT:

Is that a question for -

The problem with that is, Your

19

Honor, it wouldn't comport with the notion that we need

20

to shield administrators from lawsuits and legal

21

liability.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, not on the question of

23

qualified immunity.

24

Fourth Amendment violation.

25

On the issue of whether there is a

MR. WRIGHT:

Whether or not that would be a
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

factual determination, as to whether he could reasonably

2

suspect that the pills would be there?

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

MR. WRIGHT:

Right.

I think -- I think it could

5

lend itself to that, Your Honor, but I would prefer that

6

the Court -- we would ask the Court and it's our

7

position that the Court would lay down a bright line

8

rule such that it wouldn't end up in a factual dispute,

9

and that bright line rule is this.

Once you had reason

10

to suspect a student is possessing any contraband that

11

poses a health and safety risk, then searching any place

12

where that contraband may reasonably be found is

13

constitutional, and -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Any contraband, like the

15

black marker pencil that -- that astounded me.

16

contraband in that school, wasn't it, a black marker

17

pencil?

18

MR. WRIGHT:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MR. WRIGHT:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, for sniffing.
Oh, is that what they do?

It's a permanent marker.
They sniff them?

Well, that's the -- I mean, I'm

23

a school lawyer.

24

unfortunately, Your Honor.

25

That was

That's what kids do, Your Honor,
But -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Really?

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. WRIGHT:

But the point was is that the

2

rule -- the rule, Your Honor, is -- is grounded in the

3

notion that when there's a health and safety risk

4

because these people are charged and tasked with the

5

responsibility to keep these kids safe, they have to

6

have the opportunity to act flexibly, immediately, and

7

effectively when they're dealing with these risks.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there has to be -- I

mean, some -- the stark difference between this case and

10

T.L.O., in addition to the intrusiveness of the search,

11

was there was a teacher said:

12

they were smoking in the bathroom.

13

but this Glines identifying her classmate.

14

is done to check her veracity, nothing is done to follow

15

up on it at all.

16

the search of a purse that doesn't touch the child's

17

person.

18

I caught those girls;
Here we have nothing
And nothing

MR. WRIGHT:

Your Honor seems to be

19

concerned about the reliability of the tip in this case.

20

Your Honor, I would submit to you to that student tips

21

are the very thing that officials rely on probably the

22

most.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But an official could

24

follow up to see whether this child -- whether there is

25

a basis for what she said.

But there were no questions
15

Alderson Reporting Company

2

MR. WRIGHT:

3

corroborating evidence, Your Honor.

4

was suspicion by direct implication and there was

suspicion by circumstantial corroboration.

for saying that, I guess, is just sort of the practical

2

one, we don't know how to do that type of thing.

as the legal principle on the basis of which you

your favor in this case and the next school district

12

cavity searches, then there would be no legal basis, if

we accept your principle, for saying that's out of

14

bounds as a matter of the Fourth Amendment; isn't that

correct?

MR. WRIGHT:

I can say to this Court you will not restrict or in any

way inhibit the discretion of an administrator by saying

you can't go there on a body cavity search, nor would

11

Your Honor, that is not a

matter of the record, but the inference is that the -

5

that the investigation was still ongoing because there

was a group of kids, and at that time the administrator

I believe it went through the

lunchtime period, Your Honor, the detainment.

point out also that trying to restrict any more the rule

here that are a little extreme?

MR. O'NEIL:

and may it please the Court:
Intrusive body searches in the school

MR. O'NEIL:

show that this search was conducted pursuant to a -- an

official policy or that the vice principal was a person

25

who was acting with that authority.
25

There are a number

Official - Subject to Final Review

of grounds that -- that the plaintiff could establish

the Monell claim on the basis of, but in this case the

Ninth Circuit did not address that.

instance, but if the Court were inclined to remand on

7

before this Court reaches that.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And, therefore, we

You -- you criticized the

Ninth Circuit in your brief for having a sliding scale

10

standard, which is a bad thing in your view.

11

seems to me that your standard comes close to that.

12

call yours a differential level standard or something

13

like that?

14

MR. O'NEIL:

No, Justice Kennedy.

But it

Our

15

standard is one of greater specificity in the

16

information, not a standard that rises and falls

17

depending on the level of intrusiveness.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you have to, under

19

your standard, have reason -- a reasonable suspicion

20

specifically that -- that the student is hiding the

21

contraband in the student's underwear?

22

MR. O'NEIL:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You

That's correct, Justice Scalia.
Now, if -- if you have a

reasonable suspicion that the student has drugs and you

search every other place, you search in the student's

have a reasonable suspicion that the student has drugs,

her underpants?

You've searched

posited that the teacher began the search with

reasonable suspicion.

the obvious places like a wallet, a pocket, a desk, a

20

locker, and you didn't find it in those places, the

21

logical conclusion would not be that it must be in the

22

student's underwear, but perhaps that the information

23

that you had -

underwear.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That sounds to me

4

like the sliding scale that you reject from the Ninth

5

Circuit.

6

MR. O'NEIL:

No, because we believe that

7

where you have reasonable suspicion that there is

8

contraband in the underwear, then you could go directly

9

to that location, and you wouldn't have to work from the

10

outside in.

11

But, Justice Scalia, it takes CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, surely not.

You

16

You should go straight to the

That can't be right.
MR. O'NEIL:

Well, to take T.L.O. as an

17

example, Justice Scalia, in that case the Court believed

18

that there was reasonable suspicion that the student had

19

cigarettes in her purse because that was the obvious

20

place to find them.

21

principal in that case had searched the purse, searched

22

the student's pocket, searched the locker, searched the

desk, I don't think this Court would have said that

24

there was reasonable suspicion to believe that the

that if teachers were aware of the general practice and

19

it was common knowledge that students did hide

20

contraband in this way and -- that would be relevant to

21

the totality of the circumstances in determining whether

22

this student was following that practice.

25

anything like that practice.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

understanding that people carry ibuprofen in -- in their

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if your -

21

accepting your argument that there may be no reasonable

22

suspicion based on Marissa saying this is the person who

23

gave me the drugs, does the fact that she said kids are

24

going to -- the kids are going to take these drugs at

25

lunchtime, a specific time, does that present a
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

difference in the level of concern that the school

2

should have?

3

MR. O'NEIL:

We believe that the schools may

4

take seriously any information they receive and must

5

take seriously any information they receive about the

6

presence of prescription pills on campus.

7

that the teacher believed that these pills were going to

8

be consumed at lunch as part of an event that obviously

9

wasn't simply intended to get rid of the students'

10

headaches, we believe that that would give rise to

11

reasonable suspicion to initiate some search.

12

And the fact

But we believe that without some

13

particularized suspicion or some specific indication

14

that this, the location, was a likely one to contain the

15

drugs, that this search was excessively intrusive.

this is not a new standard.

This is essentially the

It has proved workable in that context and we

not bear any necessary logical correlation to the

And I may

Official - Subject to Final Review

is that in that circumstance, a teacher would almost

certainly ask, well, where on her person is it?

the student doesn't know, then, yes, Justice Scalia,

4

that would not satisfy the standard that we would urge

5

this Court to adopt.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And if

I mean, the student says,

7

she has -- she has crack someplace on her person, and

8

she's going to distribute it to kids during the lunch

9

hour, and so they search her -- her garments, and they

10

don't find it.

And you're saying that they cannot then

11

go ahead and search her undergarments -

MR. O'NEIL:

The nature of the contraband -

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

MR. O'NEIL:

-- because -

The nature of the contraband

could be relevant in the totality of the circumstances

to the suspicion that the student has -- is hiding it in

some illicit place as -- Justice Souter, as you noted,

18

certainly there is no practice anywhere, that I'm aware

of, of hiding ibuprofen in underwear.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So there is a sliding scale

for the dangerousness of what you're looking for?
MR. O'NEIL:

No.

It simply means that it's

How is a school

She gave

me these pills.

I don't know.

And so

4

how is the -- if it depends whether it's a dangerous

5

drug like crack or a relatively -- not harmless, but a

6

different one like ibuprofen, the search depends on

7

that, how is the school administrator supposed to know?

8
9

What are they?

MR. O'NEIL:

My point was simply with a drug

like crack there is a more common understanding that a

10

drug like that can be hidden in a student's -- in

underwear.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So what is the

deciding that searches are okay for, for example,

heroin, but not okay for cocaine.

That's what you just

17

told us we should do, in answer to Justice Alito's

18

question.

19

MR. O'NEIL:

No, I simply -- the point was

20

simply that if there is some common understanding that a

21

type of contraband is generally secreted in a certain

way, and the example is crack, and there is a known

practice, that -- that pills, for example, are hidden in

a student's -- can be hidden in a student's underwear.

Again, the example was crack, and that is a situation

where there is an understanding that that is -- can be a

place in which suspects will hide that type of item.

this case can begin and end with that well-accepted

measures qualified immunity.

Does that make a difference in the
permissibility of the search and the reasonableness of

No, it does not.

It does not in

this case, because without a suspicion that you're going

And without that suspicion you cannot

JUSTICE ALITO:

back to the legal answer, too, which is that this Court

said in T.L.O., and it's on page 342 of T.L.O., that a

search is reasonable only when there are reasonable

grounds for believing that it will turn up evidence.

scale?

MR. WOLF:

It's not a sliding scale, Your

8

Honor.

This is a two-step framework, and that is it.

9

We have ordinary searches, backpacks, pencil cases, book

10

bags, that kind of thing; and then you have a search

11

where you require a 13-year-old girl to take off her -

12

take off her pants, take off her shirt, move around her

13

bra so she reveals her breasts, and the same thing with

14

her underpants to reveal her pelvic area.

didn't reveal her body beyond her underclothes.

here, because I'm not certain.

it.

MR. WOLF:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I want to know why

that search, if that's what happened, would violate the

Fourth Amendment, assuming reasonable suspicion to think

MR. WOLF:

Yes.

46
Alderson Reporting Company

even that slightly less invasive search still implicates

legitimate and serious implications of privacy.

filed an amicus brief in this case, and what they showed

is that -- or they cited studies showing that when a

"strip search" has a lot of meanings.

psychologists focus on the situation with the child

involved, you know, this is an -- my hypothetical, is

20

that what they're talking about?

21

MR. WOLF:

I believe it is, Your -- Justice

22

Breyer.

And I believe that we cite such a study in -

23

in our brief, the red brief, where we say that it

24

doesn't require a student to take off his or her

25

undergarments so long as the shirt and the pants are
47

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Let me -- let me just, not

3

so much change the facts, but -- but emphasize a couple

4

of different aspects of the facts.

5

Assuming Justice Breyer's hypothetical of a

6

moment ago and assuming the following thought process on

7

the part of the principal -- I -- strike that.

8
9

I will vary the facts in one way.

Let's

assume, following your categorical rule that the -- the

10

principal doesn't know whether it's ibuprofen or not.

11

He just knows that there's a pill and one of the other

12

kids said this person has got pills on -- on her person.

13

The principal says, I know as a matter of reliable fact

14

that one student got sick, violently sick, within the

15

past week or so on some pill; we don't know exactly what

16

it was.

17

from where we are now that there have been kids who died

18

from ingesting dangerous drugs.

19

some drug is on this kid's person.

20

is I would rather have the kid embarrassed by a strip

21

search, if we can't find anything short of that, than to

22

have some other kids dead because the stuff is

23

distributed at lunchtime and things go awry.

20

argument and I think that argument is entirely right, if

21

the stakes are lower.

If the risk of a mistake is going

22

to be less traumatic.

In the hypo that I gave, the risk

of the mistake may well be violent sickness or death.

And I'm saying to you, why

12

isn't that a -- a reasonable thought process within the

13

concept of Fourth Amendment reasonableness?

14

MR. WOLF:

Because in order to conduct that

15

intrusive search, it seems like it that case you would

16

have to be doing guesswork, if you will, about where

17

those pills are located.

18
19
20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You've got reasonable

suspicion that they are somewhere on the person.
MR. WOLF:

That's right.

And presumably, if

21

they're -- if it doesn't show up in a pocket search,

22

then you can do a strip search; and if you don't find it

23

in the strip search, you could do a body cavity search;

24

and if it's not in the body cavity search -

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And with those stakes in

50
Alderson Reporting Company

mind, why isn't it reasonable?

2

there is a sliding scale of risk which is inherent in my

3

hypo, and why isn't that a sound basis for a -- a Fourth

4

Amendment analysis?

5

MR. WOLF:

In other words, there -

Because -- it all comes back to

6

the balancing of the Fourth Amendment.

you're conducting a traumatic search without a belief

8

that you're going to find it underneath the

undergarments, it -

drug and you have searched everywhere, perhaps you have

generated location-specific information.

calibrates the equation here, but it -- it's sort of

8

strange credulity to think that you would have loose

pills concealed against a student's genitalia.

what you'd have to think was the custom here.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As -- as I understand your

- your presentation, you qualify as a strip search any

search that requires the outer garments to be taken off.

shake out her bra or stretch the elastic of her

student to even take off the outer garments?

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's not like you have any

studies on this.

But I mean, I hate to tell you, but it

seems to me like a logical thing when an adolescent

child has some pills or something, they know people are

16

looking for them, they will stick them in their

underwear.

somebody who thinks that that's a fairly normal idea for

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what am I supposed to

do?

In my experience when I was 8 or 10 or 12 years

3

old, you know, we did take our clothes off once a day,

we changed for gym, okay?

people did sometimes stick things in my underwear -

MR. WOLF:

Yes, but the "not beyond human

think that children could hide things in their underwear

when they know they're not supposed to have them, is

4

that school official really unreasonable except in a

5

special case?

6

That's what's bothering me.

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, it -- it is unreasonable,

7

and at the end of the day, it has to be unreasonable.

8

To think that -- for school officials to think that this

9

student was hiding -- this honor student was hiding

10

pills underneath her undergarments based on nothing in

11

the record that supports that, not a single thing.

12

does the school official know?

13

accusation that Savana had provided pills at an unknown

14

time and at an unknown location, that Savana's backpack

search yielded nothing, not only pills, but no suspicion

16

that she possessed pills underneath her undergarments.

Is that a question of law or

don't know the answer to that -

12
13

JUSTICE ALITO:

In a 1983 action, wouldn't

it be a jury question?

14

MR. WOLF:

I think in this case it certainly

15

is a jury question, without anything else in the record

16

that that -- that that is a reasonable inference, and

17

without it being self-evident -- and I would actually

18

argue that it was self-evident that those pills were not

19

located there and that that's not a reasonable

20

inference.

21

But if there is some doubt about that -- and

I was hearing some doubt from Justice Breyer and perhaps

other members of this Court -- well, that strikes me as

a factual question.

And if that's a factual question to

that those objects were located there, then it would be

And if that's true, then

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't think it's a

don't think the courts allow a jury to decide whether

there was probable cause for an officer's search or

seizure.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW W. WRIGHT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. WRIGHT:

10

Thank you, Your Honor.

The reality is that we've gotten past the

11

reasonable at its inception prong, and we're now on the

12

scope.

13

the scope, I can tell you that if they found uncut

14

heroin or small-caliber bullets in this case, they would

15

have to reach the same results.

16

unacceptable in the school setting.

17

risk here when you're talking about the custodial and

18

tutelary responsibilities this Court has time and again

19

recognized as the most important elements in upholding

20

the three search cases, student search cases, that this

21

Court has upheld.

22

And I think everyone concedes that.

And, as to

And that is
There's too much at

The other thing about the government's

23

proposal is -- is really troubling.

24

do not justify why they would pass a rule that would so

25

much stunt the administrator's discretion to respond,
62
Alderson Reporting Company

It's because they

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

even in the most serious situations that confront the

2

health and safety of kids.

3

are principles that have been restated by this Court.

4

You need the flexibility to act immediately and

5

effectively to keep kids safe.

6
7

These -- these principles

JUSTICE SCALIA:
differently.

8

MR. WRIGHT:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

That's right.

MR. WRIGHT:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

Some school districts have

rules against -

11

13

Unless the people feel

Absolutely.
-- simply forbidding strip

searches on any -- right?
MR. WRIGHT:

There is an amicus brief that

15

cites 189 school districts which have substantially

16

limited strip searches, which proves the Ingraham v.

17

Wright theory, which is that it will be taken care of at

18

the local level.

19

But administrators, for now, need a

20

bright-line rule.

And as to the scope, that bright-line

21

rule is if you have reason to suspect that a student is

22

processing contraband that poses a health and safety

23

risk, then searching any place where that contraband may

24

be reasonably hidden is constitutionally permissible.

25

And in any event, Mr. Wilson in this case certainly
63
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

could have believed that the Constitution permitted it,

2

Mr. Chief Justice, and so immunity is a foregone

3

conclusion in my opinion.

4

But I would ask the Court to rule on the

5

constitutional question in the affirmative because it

6

would further the interests of judicial economy.

7

would not be any more Federal action in this case.

8
9
10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There

Yes, there would.

There's a Monell claim against the school district
because there is no qualified immunity.

11

MR. WRIGHT:

That's correct, Your Honor, but

12

if you ruled in the affirmative on the constitutional

13

question -

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

15

MR. WRIGHT:

16

The additional issue, Justice Alito, on the

-- the case is over.

17

factual question is I understand you're not talking

18

about immunity, but the reality is we've got to be able

19

to make decisions, and if we get sued on factual

20

questions because somebody questions whether or not it's

21

reasonable for us to search where contraband may be

22

reasonably located, then we're going to end up in court

23

anyway on those factual questions, which is going to -

24

you know, deter officials from acting immediately and

25

effectively in those situations.

So, I do not think it

64
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is a factual question.

And the District Court and the

2

first three-panel-judge court did hold as a matter of

3

law that this search was constitutional.
