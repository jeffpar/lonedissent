ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

We'll hear argument

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Respondents' state law claims track nearly

11

verbatim the Cigarette Labeling Act's pre-emption

12

provision.

13

promotions of light cigarettes as less harmful and safer

14

to smokers than regular cigarettes.

15

Congress, explicitly preempted any requirement

16

respecting the promotion of cigarettes based upon

17

smoking and health.

18

seeking in state court precisely what Congress

19

pre-empted.

20

For example, the complaint challenges

But the statute,

In short, the Respondents are

There is no space CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Olson, what if

21

the state law claim did not require any inquiry into the

22

relationship between smoking and health?

23

along the lines of saying our studies show that light

24

cigarettes are healthier for you, and in fact their

25

studies show the opposite.

Something

So all you, all the
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

plaintiff would have to show is that there was a

2

deception, a disconnect between the studies and the ad.

3

It wouldn't matter whether light cigarettes were

4

healthier or not healthier.

5

that could be brought?

6

MR. OLSON:

Is that the type of action

Well, I think the facts could

7

differ from case to case, Mr. Chief Justice.

But the

8

inquiry is going to be generally, I think, simple:

9

there a requirement?

Is

Is it based upon smoking and

10

health, and does it appear in an advertising or

11

promotion of a cigarette.

12

conceivably circumstances where it's impossible to tell

13

that the requirement is not connected in some way with

14

smoking and health, but it's certainly clear here.

15

Now, I suppose there might be

The complaint specifically talks in terms of

promoting cigarettes, purporting to be less harmful or

safer, despite serious health problems associated with

smoking.

of the amended complaint which is at pages, beginning

21

Court's attention to paragraph 2 of the amended

22

complaint and paragraphs 15 and 18 of the amended

complaint.

"cigarettes," "smoking," "safety," and "health," the

very words that appear in the Labeling Act statute,

These appear at the beginning in paragraph 2

complaint.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it a question of just

4

how you phrase it, Mr. Olson?

5

does your argument leave any scope for attorney general,

6

state attorney general imposition of state law remedies

7

against a deceptive practice involving advertising

8

cigarettes.

9

state attorney general said in every - suppose the

Is there any scope -

To give you concrete examples, suppose a

10

practice were in every carton of cigarettes the

11

cigarette manufacturer includes an insert that says:

12

you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes; if

13

you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our cigarettes.

14

And the state attorney general goes after that statement

15

in the carton as false and deceptive advertising.

16

there be any scope for that?

17

MR. OLSON:

I think that there is.

If

Would

In

18

answer to the general question that you ask, Justice

19

Gins burg, there is plenty of room for an attorney

20

general to pursue deceptive advertising.

21

example -- and I'll come to the one you mentioned -- is

22

that someone might misrepresent the number of cigarettes

23

in a package or other things having to do with

24

cigarettes.

25

smoking and health.

Another

That would not necessarily be related to
So there is not a pre-emption if
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there is not a relationship between the prohibition and

2

smoking and health.

3

some sort of inquiry as to what is motivating the

4

attorney general.

5

to, your Court referred to in the Reilly case and I

6

would say -

7

The example you gave might require

The motivation is what you referred

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Olson, doesn't your

8

answer in effect, in practical terms, exclude the

9

possibility of inserts like that?

I mean, what else

10

would they be addressing except smoking and health?

11

That's the only subject on the table.

12

MR. OLSON:

I think that's probably true in

13

most cases, Justice Souter, that the reason why there

14

might be regulations at the State level having to do

15

with cigarettes and advertising by and large is going to

16

have to do with smoking and health.

17

through the same inquiry in the Reilly case where it had

18

to do with billboards and -

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Court went

So your answer then to my

20

specific example would be the attorney general could not

21

go after such a statement, "If you want to ingest less

22

nicotine, buy our cigarettes"?

23

MR. OLSON:

If -- if the courts were to

24

conclude that it had a relationship with smoking and

25

health, the answer is yes, Justice Ginsburg, but there
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

might be some case in which someone said, well, the

2

issue about nicotine and content of nicotine is being

3

regulated because it doesn't have anything to do with

4

smoking and health, but in the environment in which this

5

-- this statute was passed and this litigation was

6

pursued, there certainly isn't any question here.

7

I think Justice Stevens, even in his dissenting opinion

8

in the Reilly case, focused on the content.

9

the -- your dissenting opinion in that case said, as

Now,

He said and

10

opposed to location, that the Labeling Act was focusing

11

on the content of advertising.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But suppose that a new

13

drug is found for the treatment of a condition, glaucoma

14

-- hypothetical -- and the evidence is stunningly clear

15

that smoking with this new drug causes a severe allergic

16

reaction.

17

to disclose this on the label or in promotions?

18

Does the cigarette manufacturer have any duty

MR. OLSON:

No, Justice Kennedy, to the -

19

the Federal Trade Commission, by the way, has full

20

authority to regulate deceptive -

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, I -- they've just

22

found this out last week.

Do they have any -- there can

23

be no -- I take it under your position there can be no

24

suit based on misleading or false promotion or labeling,

25

and there can be no suit even for the sale of an unsafe

2

MR. OLSON:

Well, there could be -- the

States may regulate the sale of items.

advertising, and that sort of thing.

There's no question that this complaint is

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, in your view, it says

17

in Cipollone that this -- that the four people said in

18

Cipollone that this statute does not pre-empt State law

19

where it's based on a prohibition of making a false

20

statement of material fact.

21

funny example, somebody could advertise smoking 42

22

cigarettes a day will grow back your hair.

23

(Laughter.)

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

For example, to make a

That's totally false, and

in your view, that would be pre-empted, if Congress

attempted to pre-empt a state law that says you cannot

2

make a completely false statement of material fact -

3

MR. OLSON:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

I don't --

if it's based on -- has

something to do with smoking and health.

6

MR. OLSON:

I don't mean to be whimsical,

7

but I think that, to the extent there's a representation

8

with respect to growing hair or something like that,

9

that may not -- it probably isn't -- have to do with

10

smoking and health.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I was trying to

12

produce an -- I mean, it will build strong bodies eight

13

ways.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. OLSON:

Yes.

And let me say with

16

respect to the Cipollone plurality opinion, which was

17

found to be baffling, confusing, litigation- generating,

18

easily abated by the labeling of the complaint, and

19

superseded by a number of subsequent decisions by this

20

Court, it should be set aside and restated.

21

the very case that the Cipollone decision in the

22

plurality did decide was pre-empted even under that

23

plurality opinion, and this is at page 527 of the

24

opinion, is an advertising that purported to neutralize,

3

squarely -

This complaint is precisely that

You could probably not have written a claim more

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Excuse me.

The reason I

5

think the plurality wrote this, I'm guessing, is that

6

when you read through this statute it seems as if what

7

Congress had in mind in the statute was not setting

8

aside State law, which is tradition, about not making

9

false statements, false and deceptive advertising law.

10

It was concerned with a different thing.

11

the cigarette companies:

12

"Smoking is dangerous to your health."

13

States telling you to put other things like that on the

14

label, and we don't want States forbidding you to put a

15

picture of the Marlboro man or Lauren Bacall with her

16

cigarette.

17

can't do that.

18

the statute, which no one said had as its objective

19

setting aside traditional unfair and deceptive

20

advertising law.

21

They said, to

We don't want

We don't want States to tell you that you
That would be focused on the object of

I think that's the argument.

MR. OLSON:

That is the argument, and the

22

Respondents are making that argument.

I submit that

23

that argument is squarely answered by the text of the

24

statute, which this Court has said again and again you

25

have to turn to.

The text of the statute says no
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

requirement or prohibition; it doesn't say no

2

requirement or prohibition except one which is expressly

3

misleading.

4

Breyer, what was the background for the statute or what

5

was Congress intending to do, well, fortunately on

6

section 1331 of the Labeling Act, which is on 1A of the

7

blue brief, Congress declares its policy and purpose

8

squarely, unequivocally, and in what this Court said in

9

Reilly was sweeping language:

And the reason you mentioned, Justice

Any relationship between

10

smoking and health.

And then Congress went on to point

11

out that with the labeling requirements, it intended for

12

consumers to receive certain information about the

13

smoking of cigarettes with specific labels, and then

14

went on to say, without hurting the commerce and the

15

national economy to be protected from confusing

16

cigarette labeling and advertising regulations that

17

might be "non-uniform, confusing, or diverse."

18

Now, Justice Stevens again in the Reilly

19

opinion when he was distinguishing in his concurring

20

opinion -- I can't recall whether it's a concurring or

21

dissenting opinion -- focused on the fact that different

22

requirements by different States might cause those very

23

diverse, confusing advertising.

24

you've got to put something else in there about this;

25

one State says that so-called descriptors are

If one State says,

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

misleading, as was the case under this case, and another

2

State says, like Illinois said in another case, that

3

they are not misleading; that national advertising

4

becomes impossible.

5

expressed what its policy was.

6

That's inconsistent and Congress

And, Justice Breyer, the Court went through

7

the same process in the Morales case and the Wolens case

8

in connection with airline and deregulation and whether

9

or not misleading advertising might be expressly

10

pre-empted.

11

process in the Riegel case with respect to medical

12

devices.

13

Rowe case, decided on the same day as Riegel in

14

connection with another context.

15

respect to the Reilly case, the Court -

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

17

The Court went through the same process in the

And again, with

Mr. Olson, you're relying

on 1334(b), I take it, specifically.

18
19

The Court went through the same sort of

MR. OLSON:

Yes, Justice Stevens.

Not just

1334(b) but 1331, which it helps explain.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the prohibition you're

21

talking about is in 13 -- in your express pre-emption

22

argument -- 1334(b).

23

is a State requirement prohibiting false statements

24

about smoking and health a requirement based on smoking

25

and health?

And I was just going to ask you,

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. OLSON:

I think it is, unless I

2

misunderstood your question.

If a State decides what

3

may be in the advertising or promotion -

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The predicate for "based

5

on smoking" is the word "requirement."

6

requirement that you may not make any false statements,

7

would that be a requirement based on smoking and health?

8
9

MR. OLSON:

And a

Well, the statute contains the

words both "requirement" and "prohibition."

And in your

10

plurality opinion in Cipollone on page 527, the same

11

page I mentioned before, you made the point that a

12

prohibition is merely the converse of a requirement.

13

And either a prohibition or a requirement with respect

14

to advertising if it relates to smoking and health is

15

pre-empted.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The question I'm asking,

17

though, is a requirement that you make no false

18

statements a requirement based on smoking and health?

19

MR. OLSON:

Yes.

And to the extent -- no,

20

we are not saying that the Massachusetts unfair

21

practices statute is preempted in all respects.

22

only when the statute, like a common law tort provision

23

which the Court considered in Riegel, has application to

24

the context of smoking and health.

25

It's

If the Court starts with the Morales case
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

through the Wolens case, through the Bates case, through

2

the Riegel case, through the Reilly case, it's the

3

application of the statute in the Reilly case.

4

-- it was a statute of Massachusetts very much

5

identical, virtually identical, to the Maine statute

6

here.

7

general was attempting to apply the generalized,

8

unfair-practice statute to the advertising of smoking

9

and cigarettes near schools.

It was a

And in the -- in the Reilly case the attorney

10

This is a similar statute, which is

11

attempted to be applied in the context of these labels

12

and the advertising of cigarettes.

13

of a generalized statute.

14

and specifically said in the Riegel case, there is

15

hardly any common law requirements which are

16

requirements, the Court has repeatedly held -- and the

17

Respondents don't dispute that; they specifically

18

acknowledge it -- when it's the application of a general

19

standard to the circumstances of the case.

20

the pre-emption occurs.

21

It's the application

This Court repeatedly said,

That's where

Congress didn't want to pre-empt general

22

common law standards about fraud or misrepresentation or

23

anything like that except in the context of the

24

marketing -

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why -- why would

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress -- I mean the difficulty that the other side

2

raises here is just what Cipollone said.

3

understand totally why Congress would not want 50 States

4

telling cigarette companies what to say about health and

5

smoking or taking off pictures of the Marlboro ad.

6

can understand that.

7

I can

I

What I can't understand is why Congress

8

would want to get rid of, in this area, the traditional

9

rule that advertising has to tell the truth.

10

Now, what you said was you could end up with

11

different applications of that in different States.

12

course, every national advertiser faces that situation

13

at the moment.

14

nation could find deceptive -- anti-deception laws

15

differently administered in different States.

16

they'd survive.

17

a problem.

18

that particular statute?

19

Of

Everyone who advertises across the

Yet,

There is no evidence even that there is

So why would Congress want to get rid of

MR. OLSON:

Well, the Court -- and this

20

Court recently in Aetna v. Davila specifically said that

21

pre-emption can't be decided based upon the label that

22

the plaintiff puts in the complaint.

23

Now, as I think every member of this Court

24

would know, a creative plaintiff's lawyer can call a

25

claim misrepresentation, willful misrepresentation,
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

concealment, failure to warn, and so on and so forth.

2

It's just a matter of how they change the label on the

3

complaint.

4

Now, what Congress didn't want -- and I just

5

gave an example of a situation where Illinois decided

6

that the descriptors, which are an issue in this case

7

were not misleading; and it was not -- and they could

8

continue to be used.

9

What happened in this case in applying the

10

Maine statute is a court decided that they were

11

misleading and -- and couldn't be used.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But did the Illinois --

13

Illinois court reach the question whether the claim was

14

pre -- pre-empted?

15

merits there was no fraud, if I understand what you

16

said.

17
18
19

I think it firmly decided on the

MR. OLSON:

That's correct, and I'm not

saying JUSTICE STEVENS:

So we must assume there

20

was no pre-emption, because it wouldn't have reached the

21

merits otherwise.

22

MR. OLSON:

I -- I haven't got all of the

23

specifics of that case; but what I felt -- I just simply

24

meant -- but I think it's an example of what you said in

25

your concurring opinion in Reilly:
16
Alderson Reporting Company

That if you're going

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to conduct a national advertising campaign, it can't be

2

governed by what a jury might decide in Des Moines

3

versus what a jury might decide in Birmingham, Alabama.

4

And -

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When it's not Is it the jury fracture?

7

You said the attorney general could not stop, my

8

example, "If you want to ingest less nicotine, buy our

9

lights."

The attorney general could not proscribe that.

10

So nothing that you're saying turns on it being the jury

11

rather than the attorney general, does it?

12

MR. OLSON:

Well, no, that's absolutely -

13

absolutely correct, Justice Ginsburg.

14

panoply of this Court's decisions say that it doesn't

15

matter whether it's a statute -- a generalized statute

16

that's being applied or a common law standard that's

17

being applied, and it does not matter whether it's an

18

attorney general interpreting and enforcing general

19

provisions -- I give you Morales and the Wolens

20

situation -- or it's whether it's a common law tort

21

action being brought by a plaintiff to submit a case to

22

a jury a la Riegel.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In fact, the

So your position is

24

essentially that Congress, as -- as far as the

25

advertising of low or light, Congress empowered one
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

decisionmaker only and that's the FTC, and if they don't

2

act then the cigarette companies can say anything they

3

want about low tar and low nicotine?

4

MR. OLSON:

Well, there is also -- I -- I

5

think it doesn't -- it's not dispositive of the

6

pre-emption case, but there's also the master settlement

7

agreement that the tobacco companies entered into with

8

the States, which gives the States a lot of power to

9

enforce various different things.

10

But I think that the point here is that,

11

yes, Congress decided that it wanted one uniform source

12

of regulation of advertising of cigarettes with respect

13

to smoking and health.

14

Now -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does the -- does the

15

consent decree say anything about advertising low,

16

light, those specifics?

17

MR. OLSON:

The master settlement agreement?

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MR. OLSON:

Yes.

I -- I don't -- I can't answer

20

that question.

I don't know the answer to that

21

question, but what I -- I believe that it would allow

22

broad powers by the attorney generals.

23

hasten to say, as I did at the beginning, because some

24

parties entered into that master settlement agreement I

25

don't think changes the Federal -- the congressional
18
Alderson Reporting Company

But I have -

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

intent is very clear.

2

Congress wanted the statements, certain statements, on

3

cigarette packages.

4

what the marketing or promotion of cigarettes would be.

5

It wanted the -- the statement --

It didn't want any confusion about

I can't imagine, Justice Ginsburg, a clearer

6

statement.

7

section 1334(b).

8

Federal programs that deal with cigarette labeling and

9

advertising with respect to any relationship between

10

It says no requirement or prohibition in
And in 1331 it says "comprehensive

smoking and health."

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But, Mr. Olson, isn't the

12

problem that Congress was equally clear, or has at least

13

been assumed to be equally clear, in a contrary line of

14

reasoning that holds against you?

15

reasoning is this:

16

that the FTC can represent -- it can regulate

17

advertising and -- and supposed deception on matters

18

that do affect -- relate to smoking and health.

19

And that line of

You agree -- everybody agrees -

It is pretty much hornbook law at this stage

20

of the game that the -- that the FTC's regulation of

21

deceptive advertising does not exclude State regulation

22

of deceptive advertising as a general proposition.

23

fact, the FTC is very happy to have complementary State

24

regimes.

25

at least as clear as you say the language is here.

That state of the law is just as clear.

Now, given the fact that the FTC can

regulate advertising of cigarettes in -- in the -- in

3

the respect that matters here, why don't we have to give

4

some recognition to this complementary regime of State

5

regulation, which, as a general proposition, survives

6

it?

7

MR. OLSON:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

Well, the point And all I'm saying is what

we have here is, you say, a clear preemption provision.

10

But we also have a clear regulatory regime which is at

11

odds with that preemption provision, and presumably

12

we've got to give some effect to that, too.

13

MR. OLSON:

Well, the -- the statute deals

14

with this to a degree in section 1336 by saving certain

15

responsibilities.

16

is that the background principle, the Federal Trade

17

Commission Act and Federal and State Trade -- Fair

18

Practices Act, are a part of a national scheme just

19

exactly as you said.

20

But I think the more powerful answer

It's a background -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it's part of a

national scheme, but in practical terms you can say that

22

on any subject matter that the FTC regulates.

23

nonetheless, the complementary State regimes of -- of

regulating deception survive.

argument.

14

having to do with the very same statute, the Cigarette

15

Labeling Act, the United States Government said that the

labeling act pre-empted State laws concerning the

content of cigarette advertising, the content of

then and the Acting Solicitor General during the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

10

Thank you,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice

and may it please the Court:
When Congress enacted the Labeling Act, the

11

1969 Labeling Act, it gave no intention whatsoever to

12

immunize cigarette makers for the false statements that

13

they made in violation of anti-deception in the

14

marketplace rules.

15

special rulemaking authority that applied industrywide,

16

and in fact the FTC's enforcement authority with respect

17

to individual companies was quite limited.

They didn't empower the FTC with any

JUSTICE ALITO:

The argument

Mr. Frederick, suppose that

20

the FTC had adopted the rule that it considered in 1970

21

and required that the tar and nicotine figures that were

22

produced by the particular testing method that is at

23

issue here to be placed on all cigarette ads and

24

promotions; and then suppose that Maine issued a

25

regulation requiring that all ads and promotions in the

State of Maine state that the Federal figures are

2

misleading and should be disregarded.

MR. FREDERICK:

Would that

That would be implied

5

conflict pre-emption, and we would acknowledge that

6

would be pre-empted.

7

9

The difference here -

JUSTICE ALITO:

What's the difference

between that situation and this situation?
MR. FREDERICK:

The difference here is that

10

between a generally applicable rule that is specially

11

targeted at the cigarette industry and a generally

12

applicable rule against deception, upon which a fact

13

finder would not need to make any special inquiry about

14

smoking and health.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How is that

21

would be unusual anyway, and general common law duty.

"We have held that a

That's no suggestion that this is a

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, I have three

23

responses, Mr. Chief Justice.

The first is that the

24

text in Riegel was different; the purposes behind what

25

Congress enacted in the medical device amendments were
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

different; and third, this Court twice, in both Reilly

2

and in Cipollone, has looked at this exact statute and

3

come to the opposite conclusion.

4

First with respect to the text of the

5

medical device amendments, there are several provisions

6

of that act that are quite a bit broader than what the

7

1969 Labeling Act -

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You say Riegel

wasn't referring to the particular text of any statue.

10

It was making a general point.

11

held that a provision pre-empting State requirements,

12

which is exactly what this one does, pre-empted common

13

law duties.

14

MR. FREDERICK:

The Court said:

We have

And the result, Mr. Chief

15

Justice, of virtually every one of this Court's

16

pre-emption cases has been to look at the particular

17

words of the statute to determine the scope of the

18

pre-emption.

19

in Morales.

20

The Court did that in Bates.

It did that

It did CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So as a general

21

proposition -- I understand your position to be that

22

this particular statute doesn't pre-empt the common law

23

duties, but the distinction I thought you articulated in

24

response to Justice Alito's question was that general

25

common law duties are not pre-empted; specific tailored
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ones are.

2

MR. FREDERICK:

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

general common law duty can be pre-empted by a

5

particular statute?

6

MR. FREDERICK:

No.
You agree that a

I do acknowledge that,

7

Mr. Chief Justice.

But my point is that in the medical

8

device amendments what Congress was getting at were

9

things that were quite a bit broader and it had sweeping

10

language.

It said not only to establish but also to

11

continue in effect, with respect to a device, which

12

relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device, or

13

"to any other matter included in a requirement

14

applicable to the device."

15

By contrast -

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you're -- so

17

you're saying that we should -- the difference in your

case is that the language here is narrower.

20

how that language is narrower.

MR. FREDERICK:

It says "no
I don't see

No, I think you're quoting

22

1334(a) and the pre-emption provision at issue here, Mr.

23

Chief Justice, is 1334(b) which says -

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

So 1334(b)

says "no requirement or prohibition with respect to."
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Isn't that just as broad?

2

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, no, it isn't, because

3

the modifying term that's at issue in this case comes

4

between the two points that you quoted, and that's the

5

phrase "based on smoking and health."

6

here is that a generalized duty not to deceive is not a

7

requirement based on smoking and health.

8

a duty not to deceive.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Our contention

It's based on

How do you tell -

10

how do you tell whether it's deceptive or not if you

11

don't look at what the relationship is between smoking

12

and health?

13

cigarettes are better for you than regular cigarettes.

14

You have to know what the relationship is between

15

smoking and health to determine whether that's

16

deceptive.

17

They have an advertisement that says light

are achieving the same yield of tar and nicotine that -

common law duties?

3

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes, they were.

Those -

4

the fraudulent neutralization of warning claim and the

5

failure to warn claim were common law claims, Justice

6

Alito, but the difference here is that in Cipollone the

7

plurality plus the three Justices who joined Justice

8

Blackmun's opinion and would have found no common law

9

claims preempted.

Seven Justices found fraud claims

10

that are virtually identical to ours not to be preempted

11

because Congress lacked any intent to displace State

12

laws concerning deception.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Frederick, if I take

14

away from your oral argument that it is your position

that this suit is not based on a link between smoking

and health, I'm going to have difficulty in accepting

smoking and health but it is subject to a general duty,

MR. FREDERICK:

Do you have a

health.
There is a second argument, which is that

3

even under the application of that generalized duty, the

4

jury here or the trial court would not be asked to look

5

at the linkage between smoking and health.

6

simply say, have a scientist up there who says the yield

7

of a light cigarette is no different than the yield of a

8

regular cigarette.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It could

Do I understand your basic

10

argument to be that this statute is a prohibition

11

against State warnings in either promotion or

12

advertising different from the Federal one?

That's correct.

the general purpose of the statute.

of course, that -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That was

There is language,

This specific quotation

deals only with the contents of the advertising that

might be described as warnings different from those in

the Federal scheme.

That's absolutely correct,

Justice Stevens.

with these light descriptors are comparisons between two

23

products that, in fact, are not different.

24
25

And here what we are talking about

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your answer to Justice

Ginsburg's question was that the state attorney general
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

could not impose a regulation that said you must say

2

that low tar cigarettes have as much nicotine as regular

3

cigarettes.

4

why could the plaintiff do it in his lawsuit?

5

If the attorney general couldn't do that,

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, the attorney general

6

could bring the same suit that we bring here, Justice

7

Kennedy.

8
9
10

The difference is between a JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No.

The hypothetical was

the attorney general requires this as a regulation under
his authority.

11

MR. FREDERICK:

And let me answer the

12

hypothetical this way:

13

the lawsuit under the State deceptive practices act but

14

cannot issue a generalized regulation targeted at the

15

cigarette industry that takes truth completely out of

16

the equation, because if another cigarette company comes

17

up and says, "We actually have a light cigarette that is

18

lower in tar," and we can prove it -

19

The attorney general can bring

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose he wins the

20

lawsuit -- he wins the lawsuit that it's false and

21

deceptive to say "low."

22

that says cigarette companies don't advertise "low" or

23

"light"?

24
25

Could he then have a regulation

MR. FREDERICK:

I think that's a much more

difficult hypo, but I think the answer is the same and
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that would be no, because a regulation would be -- would

2

be specifically targeted at the industry and it would be

3

based on smoking and health, not deception.

4

In an injunctive situation, adjudicatory

5

facts can evolve.

6

the facts have changed, circumstances have changed,

7

please modify the injunction.

8

generalized regulation is imposed that is specifically

9

targeted at facts regardless of their truth or veracity.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

"light"?

13

A company can come forward and say

That can't happen when a

Well, can you make that

What would change about the label "low" or

MR. FREDERICK:

If the -- if the company

14

came forward and said, "we redesigned our cigarette,"

15

and it in fact does yield less tar and nicotine under a

16

scientifically verifiable test, that would be -- that

17

would run afoul of the regulation, but it would not run

18

afoul of the general duty not to deceive.

8

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Your Honor, the

and to a large extent the express pre-emption question

in this case is what was the meaning of the decision in

position of the United States?

directed to an area in which the Federal Government has

21

an extensive interest in regulation, and I would have

thought there'd be a position on that.

It is logically

You would

consider whether there is express pre-emption before

It's a statute that is

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

I don't believe

that the position that the United States stated in

Reilly is dispositive of the first question presented in

9

this case.

But, again, that doesn't mean that the brief

10

that the United States has filed with respect to implied

11

pre-emption is not relevant.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's not

13

anymore.

I understood -- I understood Mr. Olson to give

14

up on implied pre-emption in his opening argument.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

argument that the Petitioners make with respect to

2

implied pre-emption, but they also make it with respect

3

to express pre-emption, and that is -- and, Justice

4

Ginsburg -

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Does the FTC at this point

6

in 2008 have an opinion about whether the tar and

7

nicotine figures that are produced by this testing

8

method are meaningful or misleading?

9

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, as Your Honor

10

is aware, we submitted a -- a supplemental authority

11

letter that in July of this year the Commission issued a

12

request for comment on a proposal to rescind its

13

guidance with respect to the tar and nicotine test

14

results, precisely because of concern that they are

15

misleading due to the evidence that has developed about

16

the incidence of compensation.

17

the time that the Commission issued its guidance back in

18

1966 and '67 to present a significant problem.

19

is evident now.

20

certainly the findings of fact in the RICO case are that

21

the -- that the tobacco companies have known since 1967

22

that in fact compensation is nearly complete, and for

23

that reason, the tar and nicotine yields via the

24

Cambridge test method are not indicative of the yield to

25

a true human smoker.

That was not believed at

But it

The scientific community indicates and

And for that reason, it proposed
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to withdraw.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would it be -- would it be

3

unfair to say that for quite sometime now, nearly 40

4

years, the FTC has passively approved the placement of

5

these tar and nicotine figures in advertisement?

6

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

With respect to the

7

-- I want first to take issue with the question of

8

"approved," because I think that it -- it draws an

9

analogy to the FDA context, to Riegel and the like, and

10

that is not the nature of what the Federal Trade

11

Commission does.

12
13

It doesn't stand -

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, you passed a rule to

require it, did you not?

14

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

15

to require the disclosure of tar and nicotine -

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

We proposed a rule

And you withdrew that after

17

the companies voluntarily agreed to place the

18

information on the ads -

19

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's correct.

-- and entered into consent

21

decrees with other companies requiring them to put

22

information in their ads.

23

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

No.

The consent

24

decrees did not require them to put the information in

25

their ads.

It said that it would be deceptive to make
45

claims about the tar and nicotine content of the

Was there a different

between saying "light" and saying "lower in tar" in

16

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Yes, Your Honor,

17

because the -- the "light," on its own, much more

18

conveys the impression to the consumer that this is the

19

yield to the consumer himself, the actual human smoker,

20

you have misled everybody who's bought those cigarette

4

for a long time.

And if they are misleading, then

5

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

They -- whether

6

they are or are not misleading depends upon the

7

incidence of compensation.

8

issued its guidance in 1966 and '67, the HEW report was

9

that compensation was not expected to be a problem.

At the time the Commission

It

10

was not believed to be a problem.

11

when in light of the Barclay's case in which it was

12

determined that a particular cigarette, the yield

13

according to the test method had nothing to do with

14

yield to an actual consumer, the FTC started to inquire

15

about this.

16

Beginning in 1983,

But the Petitioners, although they have

17

known since 1967 about the incidence of compensation,

18

failed to disclose that information to the Commission.

They have failed to -- they have refused to give them

20

the benefit of their insights, their own studies.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

You're right.

In 1978 -

It's been general knowledge

for a long time, and the FTC has done nothing about it.

7

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

There has been a

8

question.

In 1978, the Commission issued a notice

9

requesting comment about whether lip drape in fact

10

occluded the holes that dilute the concentration of the

11

air, and the tobacco companies did not respond to that,

12

even though they had their own studies showing that it

13

was a problem.

14

Commission has only now issued the notice proposing to

withdraw its earlier guidance; but the Petitioners

themselves should not be able to benefit from their own

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

You just didn't want

to argue it.
MR. OLSON:

I -- we feel that we explained

it very thoroughly in our briefs, and I thought knowing

11

that the time was limited I thought we should focus on

12

the strongest argument I think by any stretch of the

13

imagination, when Congress has spoken directly.

14

Now, first of all, with respect to what the

15

Solicitor General on behalf of the United States says,

16

and this is in response to the point that Justice Scalia

17

was just addressing -- page 1 of the Reilly brief, the

18

Attorney General is responsible for enforcing the

19

Labeling Act.

20

according to them, to enforce the Labeling Act.

21

So it is the government's responsibility,

Then on pages 8 and 9 of their brief,

22

distinguishing between the location of the billboards in

23

that case and other things that would be pre-empted,

24

pages 8 and 9, the Government said the Labeling Act

preempts State laws concerning the content of cigarette

pre-empt rules about location; it pre-empts rules about

content?

10

MR. OLSON:

That was the government's point.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the government's

12

position.

13

one additional step to say depending on what the history

of the statute is, that it pre-empts regulations about

content that don't have to do with lying about the

16

content?

17

Now, if that's their position, isn't it just

MR. OLSON:

It has to do according to what

the promotion of cigarettes; that's what this case is

about when it has to do with smoking and health.
