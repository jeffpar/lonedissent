CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

5

States.

Mr. Hochman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. HOCHMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. HOCHMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Failure to report is not a violent felony

12

under the Armed Career Criminal Act because it presents

13

neither a serious potential risk of injury to others nor

14

involves violent and aggressive conduct.

15

The Government argues that failure to report

16

satisfies both the risk of injury and violent,

17

-aggressive conduct standards for the same reason:

18

prospect that a offender will violently resist an arrest

19

-- resist arrest upon completion of the offense or upon

20

-- for having done the offense.

21

potential risk alone is neither as a matter of fact nor

22

law sufficient to satisfy either the risk of injury or

23

the violent, aggressive conduct standard.

24
25

The

That potential and that

Beginning with the risk of injury:

The

statute refers to a serious potential risk of injury,
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and by using the word "serious" Congress indicated not

2

just any felony, not just any felony which carries

3

necessarily some risk of injury would be included.

4

risk that must be generated must be one that's somehow

5

greater than, something that warrants singly out this

6

sort of offender as the sort of person who's deserving

7

of greater punishment for his recidivism.

8
9
10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The

I take it you

concede that a breakout as opposed to a failure to
report would be covered by the statute?

11

MR. HOCHMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, I think it

12

would.

13

that the courts of appeals have made and that the

14

Government made here is equating breakout, prison

15

escape, with failure to report.

16

different.

17

as a matter of analytically the categorical rule and

18

what would you look at to determine whether this sort of

19

person satisfied the violent and aggressive standard.

20

And we now know, in light of the Sentencing Commission's

21

report that was filed just last -- that was filed with

22

the Court just last week, that the risk of injury

23

associated with a prison breakout escape and failure to

24

report is dramatically different.

25

I think that in fact one of the critical errors

They are entirely

They are importantly different, both again

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that mistake -

But suppose it were shown

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- this is hypothetical.

Suppose it were shown that 90

2

percent of all escapes under the escape statute were

3

breakouts involving weapons; 10 percent were failure to

4

report.

Would that affect how we decide the case?

5

MR. HOCHMAN:

This case?

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

MR. HOCHMAN:

Yes.

Well, since -- I think since

8

this is not a prison breakout case, I don't know whether

9

data about breakouts -

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do we look to the crime to

11

see generally whether or not it involves violence and

12

serious risk of harm?

13
14

MR. HOCHMAN:

I think you -- I think the

categorical rule does require you to look at -

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So that, in my

16

hypothetical, it would be a more difficult case than the

17

case we have here or would it be the same?

18

MR. HOCHMAN:

I think in your hypothetical,

19

where a prison breakout-- where a prison breakout is

20

involved -

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No.

My hypothetical is,

22

under the statute, if you look at the whole universe of

23

prosecutions under the escape statute, 90 percent of

24

them are for breakouts involving weapons.

25

MR. HOCHMAN:

I don't think that you look to
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the universe under the escape statute.

2

Shepard -

3
4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You can under

But that's what we looked

to in Begay.

5

MR. HOCHMAN:

But the issue under Shepard

6

and the approach under the categorical rule requires you

7

-- allows you to look at a narrower subsection of the

8

statute if the charging document and other reliable

9

indicia indicate that.

And in this case, it's

10

undisputed that Mr. Chambers was convicted only of

11

failing to report.

12

serious offense of prison breakout.

13

Illinois they are punished at different levels, and the

14

evidence is absolutely clear -

15

He was not convicted of the more

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And in fact in

Maybe -- I don't

16

want to put words in his mouth, but I thought what

17

Justice Kennedy was asking is what if you have a statute

18

that is just escape or whatever and doesn't break it

19

down like that?

20

the crime of escape was typically like, most of them

21

were breakout or most of them were the other thing?

22

have, I gather, two separate provisions, but what if you

23

don't?

24
25

At that point would we look to see what

MR. HOCHMAN:

Yes.

You

And that -- that is a

difficult question under the categorical rule.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the first step would be to determine whether there

2

is anything in the record.

3

to other indications of whether the conduct at issue

4

that was found by the jury or that was pled to, either

5

from an indictment or from plea colloquy, whether there

6

is some more specific indication.

7

what you would look at -- and I think here you would

8

look at, to the extent you're looking at the risk -- on

9

the risk of injury side, you would look at the best

something you're also allowed to take into

consideration.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What was the sentence for

that?

MR. HOCHMAN:

It -- the sentence appears

2

that they extended his probation.

3

four weekends that he had failed -- for which he had

4

failed to report, and his probation was extended.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He had to serve the

But he didn't get any

extra jail time?

7

MR. HOCHMAN:

He did not get any additional

8

jail time as far as I can tell from the record, Your

9

Honor.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There is really a problem

11

about -- about what you suggest.

12

whole benefit of the categorical approach.

13

can always shave something down to become a narrower

14

crime.

15

could look to see whether the particular escape in

16

question from the charging document was an escape that

17

used firearms or was an escape that, you know, that

18

injured or killed guards.

19

into the case-by-case examination that it is the whole

20

purpose of the categorical approach to avoid.

21

do we -- how do we avoid getting to the bottom of that

22

slippery slope?

23

It may destroy the
I mean, you

An escape statute, for example, I suppose you

MR. HOCHMAN:

And, you know, that gets us

Now, how

I think this -- I think this

24

Court took that step in Shepard, and it did it in a very

25

narrow and circumscribed way.

It did it by saying the

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

only things you're allowed to consider are things that

2

are as reliable as the charge itself and the elements

3

essential to -

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

I mean, the charge

5

mentions -- mentions a firearm.

6

charge can be used to narrow the crime that we are

7

looking at.

8
9

MR. HOCHMAN:

Anything that's in the

If the jury instructions were

clear, if it's clear that the jury had to find that the

10

presence of a firearm -- and I think it complicates -

11

that is, I think some courts refer to it as the modified

12

categorical rule.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It has to be an element of

14

the crime.

15

escape, then I don't have to worry about it.

16

If using a firearm is not an element of

MR. HOCHMAN:

If -- if -- correct.

If it's

17

not an element in the sense that he either pled to it or

18

the jury necessarily found it as a necessary matter.

19

And that's really what Shepard says.

20

something that we necessarily know occurred from the

21

fact of conviction, and -

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It has to be

Okay, but it doesn't have

23

to be an element.

So, if all the evidence in the case

24

was that, you know, he wrestled a gun from the guard and

25

made his way out of the prison that way, if the jury
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

found him guilty, that was the only basis on which it

2

could have found him guilty, that would be enough.

3

MR. HOCHMAN:

I don't think that Shepard

permits you to look into trial transcripts of evidence

5

that was presented.

What did the jury

And what I mean by "jury

What did the jury have to find in order

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It just says:

Well, that sounds like an

That sounds like an element.
MR. HOCHMAN:

I think it is elements, but if

you look -

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

MR. HOCHMAN:

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well Please, continue.
If you look at the cases

17

that we've had to decide under this statute in the last

18

couple of years, do you think they illustrate that the

19

categorical approach just doesn't work in this

20

situation?

21

single crime that comes up here of making -- of trying

22

to ascertain what is the serious risk when we don't have

23

any empirical -- we don't have a number quantifying what

24

a serious risk is, nor can we generally find what the

25

risk is that's associated with a particular class of

Because it puts us in a position for every

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

cases.

2

Maybe when Congress enacted this they never

3

anticipated that it would be done on a categorical

4

basis.

5

there was a serious potential risk in this particular

6

case?

7

walks away, that's one thing.

8

has a long list of convictions for violent -- violent

9

crimes and escapes, that's another situation.

Why not just have a determination as to whether

So, if you have a -- a nonviolent person who

10

MR. HOCHMAN:

If you have somebody who

I think there are two problems

11

with that approach, Your Honor:

12

said in Shepard, the categorical rule, which was adopted

13

way back when the Court first confronted the statute and

14

has been consistently applied ever since, more or less

15

anticipated the Sixth Amendment Apprendi concerns that

16

might come from digging in and trying to attribute

17

conduct which has not been found by a jury, which

18

doesn't have that level of reliability, whether it's an

19

element or was on a special verdict form or some -- or

20

some other -- or was admitted to in a plea colloquy.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't that a separate

22

question?

23

it can be submitted to the jury?

24
25

First, as the Court

If it had -- if it has to be found by a jury,

MR. HOCHMAN:

Well, if it was submitted to

the jury, then I think under Shepard it's something that
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

could be considered, and that would be part of what's

2

referred to as the modified categorical approach.

3

think the problems with the categorical approach that

4

you're identifying, courts have tried and Shepard itself

5

in effect amended enough to provide some kind of

6

flexibility.

7

I

The other reason to hold back on such a sea

8

change is this is, after all, a statutory case and the

9

categorical rule has been this Court's approach from the

10

beginning.

11

If after 20 years it hasn't -

12

Congress could easily revise the statute.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, it could, and if it

13

had read these cases and it was paying attention to this

14

problem, you would think it would go through a list of

15

crimes and say, these fall within it and these don't

16

fall within it.

17
18

But obviously it hasn't done that.

MR. HOCHMAN:

I think that would make

everybody's job, the bar and this Court, much easier.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it might not, if it

20

just said "escape," and then you'd have this same

21

problem.

22

MR. HOCHMAN:

That might be the case,

23

although if it just said "escape," I think I'd actually

24

have a substantially harder case than what we have here,

25

because what we have here doesn't resemble the kind of
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

violent, aggressive conduct that this Court in Begay

2

said is going to be the standard and exemplar of the

3

sort of conduct that Congress was thinking about.

4

added -- this Court in Begay said that the serious

5

potential risk of injury is just one part of the

6

inquiry, that Congress was also singling out crimes

7

commit ted in a certain way, and if that, if that

8

requirement is going to have any bite, if it's going to

9

do the job of singling out and separating out cases, it

It

10

has to be something beyond the mere routine,

11

ever-present prospect that an offender might resist

12

arrest for having committed the offense after police

13

discover that he has done so.

14
15

And in fact if you step back for a moment
and just visualize -

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Surely it depends upon how,

17

how, what should I say, how often that prospect is

18

realized.

19
20
21

MR. HOCHMAN:

There is no doubt.

There is

no doubt that the prospect JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, the statute itself

22

lists robbery and robbery very often doesn't involve any

23

threat of injury, but all and all we think it does.

24

Obviously, Congress thought it did, right?

25

MR. HOCHMAN:

Well in the -- I actually
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think robbery would satisfy under the first clause

2

because it has as an element the use, attempted use, or

3

threatened use of physical force against another.

4

think the concern that escape is much more easily

5

detected than other crimes is obviously true.

6

the prospect that the offender will be arrested is

7

obviously greater than in other, in other crimes.

But I

And so

8

But the point is the standards, the standard

9

imposed by Begay and the notion that the conduct must be

10

violent and aggressive, if you step back and visualize

11

what it is about burglary, arson, extortion or the use

12

of explosives that can properly be characterized as

13

violent and aggressive, surely it is not the prospect

14

that an offender will have been found out for having

15

committed those offenses, police will be dispatched to

16

arrest them, and then the offender upon that

17

confrontation will violently resist arrest.

18

just -- it's not, it's not what those enumerated

19

offenses are doing in the statute.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

robbery.

22

violent or aggressive?

23
24
25

I didn't mean to say

I meant to say burglary.

MR. HOCHMAN:

It's

Why is burglary

I think the reason is because

-JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, burglary by its

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

nature is--

you do it at night.

2

detected.

3

sneaky, is what it is.

It's not violent or aggressive at all.

4

MR. HOCHMAN:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

aggressive.

7

You don't want to be

I assume that Robbery is violent or

You're quite right about that.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

When you say burglary, if

8

you're at home, if you're at home it's going to get

9

violent and aggressive.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but -- that may be,

11

but it does not in its nature indicate violence or

12

aggressiveness.

13

It's

MR. HOCHMAN:

I think, Justice Souter, has

14

it exactly right.

15

Begay and Taylor, by the way, singled out burglary as

16

having some kind of inherent danger and potential for

17

violent and aggressive conduct associated with it is

18

because it involves an act of invading the space of

19

another, and cultural expectations and even common law

20

expectations about how others might respond suggest that

21

that scenario that you have willingly created, knowing

22

full well that another might respond violently to what

23

you've done in the event you've been detected -

24
25

I think the reason why the Court in

JUSTICE SCALIA:
the soup.

It gets you right back into

What you're saying is all it requires is that
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there be a potential for violence, for aggressiveness,

2

right?

3

is a potential for violence and aggressiveness.

And that's what the Government says here:

4

MR. HOCHMAN:

There

What it -- what it requires is

5

the conscious creation of circumstances that you have

6

good reason to believe is going to ignite in violence.

7

And if we learned anything from the data that's been

8

submitted to the Court both by the Sentencing Commission

9

and by the Government, it's that there is very little

10

reason to believe that even the distant arrest scenario

11

for those who fail to report doesn't carry with it very

12

much of a risk of injury at all.

13

materials that have been submitted to this Court, there

14

is not a single cited instance or case of an innocent

15

bystander or a police officer who has been injured in

16

connection with a confrontation from arrest for failure

17

to report.

18

In fact, in all the

There are none.
Now to be sure, there are some instances of

19

violent confrontation and I'm not here saying it's

20

impossible that there would be injury associated with an

21

arrest scenario.

22

There is nothing in the record that would give us any

23

reason to believe this is the kind of special violent

24

conduct that Congress was singling out for special

25

treatment.

The point is it's nothing different.

I should also add that excluding failure to
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

report from the statute isn't going to create any kind

2

of crack through which the sort of people the Government

3

appears to be concerned about might fall through.

4

the reason it this.

5

cite in their brief and a couple of the cases that

6

Massachusetts reported back to them which had involved

7

some kind of violent resisting arrest, those individuals

8

were charged, separately charged for assault and battery

9

and similar crimes on a police officer.

And

The several anecdotal cases they

It's

10

unsurprising that when that happens, those individuals

11

will be separately charged and convicted for their

12

violent conduct.

13

So the only work that is done by sweeping

14

away the categorical rule, doing serious damage to the

15

categorical rule, undermining Begay, the only work

16

that's done is to encompass people who we have reason to

17

believe didn't engage in violent conduct.

18

me a strange way to interpret the statute, certainly not

19

the sort of things this Court would want to close its

20

eyes to.

21

The last thing, Your Honors.

That seems to

It's important

22

to preserve the distinction in Begay between the violent

23

and aggressive standard on the one hand and the risk of

24

injury on the other hand, and Government's approach

25

collapses it.

The Government says, why is this violent
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and aggressive?

2

falsely, as we've discussed, but because in their view

3

there is a sufficient risk of injury on arrest.

4

that's going to be the case, if you're going to be able

5

to show conduct is violent and aggressive simply because

6

there is a sufficient risk of injury associated with it,

7

the violent and aggressive conduct standard does

8

nothing.

9

Because in their view we can -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If

That doesn't square with

10

the answer you gave me with regard to burglary.

11

you just said is true, burglary wouldn't be among the

12

listed crimes.

13

MR. HOCHMAN:

No.

If what

The distinction I'm

14

drawing here is the act that you take of invading

15

somebody else's space and the prospect -- what you're

16

doing is you're consciously taking an act fully aware

17

that violence might ensue, which suggests that you are

18

the sort of person who is comfortable in a violent

19

situation or at least dangerously comfortable in such a

20

violent situation, regardless of how frequently that -

21

that circumstance actually is realized.

22

of person who has taken an action that expresses comfort

23

with that sort of situation.

24

Failing to report -

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
18
Alderson Reporting Company

You're the sort

So invading

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

someone's space, so trespass would be covered by this

2

statute?

You're invading someone's space.

3

MR. HOCHMAN:

If it's -- if it's felonious,

4

trespass might be.

You're invading someone's space in

5

the circumstance where the response is -- I think there

6

is a decent argument for trespass if for no other reason

7

than the act itself, on the violence and aggressive

8

standard side, the act itself is more or less the same

9

as burglary.

It's not as if you can immediately tell

10

from observing the burglar enter the structure that he

11

has the intent, the requisite intent to commit another

12

crime.

13

But the other reason why I doubt that

14

trespass might be -- might satisfy the standard is

15

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

6
7

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

8
9

Thank you, counsel.

Failure-to-report escape qualifies as a
violent felony under the ACCA's residual clause because

10

it creates a serious potential risk of physical injury

11

that's comparable in both kind and degree to the risk

12

that's created by the enumerated offense of burglary.

13

Failure-to-report escape is similar in kind to burglary

14

because it's purposeful, violent, and aggressive in the

15

same way as burglary.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Roberts, wouldn't

17

that be so of any crime?

18

Any crime, any -- an arrest for any crime has a certain

19

risk that the arrestee is going to resist.

20

anything different, is anything greater, about this

21

arrest for this kind of crime?

22

MR. ROBERTS:

This is failure to report.

Yes, Your Honor.

Is there

Two points

23

on that.

First, escape and failure-to-report escape,

24

other types of escape and recapture, are linked ed in a

25

way that arrest and the typical crime aren't, because
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

escape inherently avoids -- inherently involves the

2

avoidance of custody and custody is the very obligation

3

that recapture is trying to impose.

4

isn't an element of the typical crime, so the connection

5

between arrest and the ordinary crime isn't close enough

6

to justify considering the violence in arrest -- in the

7

arrest in whether the crime is violent.

8

--

9
10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But avoiding arrest

Also the risk

Say that again.

I didn't

understand it.
MR. ROBERTS:

Okay.

What I'm saying is it's

12

an element of escape that you're avoiding custody, and

13

escape is a continuing offense and so it doesn't end

14

until the avoidance of custody is over.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What's that got to do with

16

increasing the risk of violence?

17

your kind of elements argument, but it seems to be

18

beside the point that -

19

MR. ROBERTS:

I mean, I see -- I see

It shows the close connection

20

between the two.

21

offender is committing the crime, it's appropriate to

22

hold him accountable for what he can see is so highly,

23

closely connected to the crime and which, in fact, has

24

to happen in order to end the crime; whereas -

25

And so when you're -- when the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but the crime is still

21
Alderson Reporting Company

-- the crime that we are concerned with here is still

2

essentially a passive crime.

3

MR. ROBERTS:

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

He just doesn't show up.

Well And given, you know, the

5

close logical connections, I don't see that the close

6

logical connections convert the passive crime into a

7

higher degree of resisting arrest from any other.

So we need not so

many -- not so much statistics about how many times

violence results, but statistics about how serious the

13

MR. ROBERTS:

I don't think you really need

the statistics, Your Honor.

I think it's a common -

15

it's common sense that the police are going to make

16

vigorous efforts to recapture people who fail to show up

17

to prison the way they are supposed to.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it's not common sense

19

that the person who has been guilty of a crime so

gentlemanly that they only made him report to prison on

fundamental point is that -- that the ACCA requires a

potential risk.

decide these cases without statistics.

19

based on an empirical assessment.

What James says is that you

22

try to assess whether the degree of risk is comparable

23

to the degree of risk presented by one of the enumerated

24

offenses.

25

And, as you did in James JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But isn't that's based on

30
Alderson Reporting Company

our experience because we have these cases; we've been

some sort of a -

Yes.
If statistics can inform

that, why ignore the statistics?
MR. ROBERTS:

I'm not saying that you should

11

ignore the statistics, but the statistics are neither

12

necessary nor dispositive.

13

statistics cast any doubt on the commonsense conclusion

14

based on some of the factors I was talking about before,

15

about why there's a potential for violence during -

16

And I don't think the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But your argument goes

17

simply to whether there is potential and the statute

18

says "serious potential."

19

me, to the point that Justice Kennedy is making, and

20

that is, we've got to have something more than an

21

instinctive belief that something bad might happen.

22

MR. ROBERTS:

Which gets us, it seems to

Well, I think James addresses

23

that, Your Honor.

And James says that in deciding

24

whether you have a serious potential, you look to the

25

enumerated offenses and you determine if they can be

comparable.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They were taking as

3

examples cases in which there was serious potential.

4

But in any event, you can't lose sight of the modifier.

It has got to be more than a so-called "potential risk."

1

than the risk of violence in apprehending an ordinary

2

criminal for several different related reasons.

3
4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One -

There is -- there was,

this case comes to us from the Seventh Circuit, right?

5

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And am I correct in

7

understanding that since this case was decided, the

8

Seventh Circuit has changed its position and has gone

9

the other way?

10

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

The Seventh Circuit

11

thought that applying the purposeful, violent and

12

aggressive requirement of Begay required a different

13

result because it -- it thought that it meant that the

14

crime had to involve violent conduct itself; and it

15

didn't appreciate the point I was making before, that

16

burglary doesn't involve that violent conduct itself,

17

and that burglary is violent because of the prospect of

18

the violent confrontation.

19

And so, that's the -- that's what led the

20

Seventh Circuit astray the second time around.

21

--

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it

The first time around,

23

didn't one of the judges suggest that there ought to be

24

a study comparing the frequency of violence in escapes

25

from custody to the frequency of violence in failure to
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

report, and isn't that what we now have from the

2

Sentencing Commission?

3

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

They did ask for -- for

4

statistics.

5

that -- that looking to statistics as some kind of a

6

requirement is, you know, both perilous and not required

7

by the statute:

8

potential risk, not actual injury.

9

But I would stress again why we think

One, because the statute requires just

Two, because these data are just generally

10

not going to be available.

11

baseline for the other crimes, the enumerated crimes,

12

really to compare it to.

13

start looking around for statistics and saying we need

14

these statistics to do it, is that virtually no crimes

15

are going to qualify under the residual clause.

16
17
18

And you don't have even the

And so the result, if you

And obviously, that isn't what Congress
intended when it adopted this broad residual clause.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I -- may I -- may I ask

19

you just to get some sense about what will qualify?

20

mean, I think we -- we all agree that the risk of

21

violence in arrest is probably going to vary depending

22

on -- categorically depending on the crimes.

23

I

I think I would probably agree that

24

white-collar crimes are not likely to -- to carry a very

25

high risk of violence on arrest.

So I -- there's one

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

category.

2

outside of white-collar crime, that are going to have a

3

lower risk of arrest than, say, the failure-to-report

4

category?

5

Can you think of others, other categories

MR. ROBERTS:

What -- we wouldn't sweep in

6

any crimes based on arrest if the crimes don't

7

themselves involve as part of the crime the avoidance of

8

custody, because that shows the close link between the

9

crime that I was explaining before.

That's sort of the

10

categorical difference, although I would agree with you,

11

certainly, that in white-collar crimes in many cases the

12

offender is going to submit voluntarily to custody; they

13

are not even going to come after him.

14

done anything to show his likelihood to resist in any

15

way, and so there is going to be a significantly less

16

connection there.

17

And he hasn't

Violent crimes where you might think that

18

there is going to be a higher incidence are going to be

19

covered based on the violence of the crime, anyway.

20
21
22
23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They are going to be in

category one.
MR. ROBERTS:

Right.

They are going to be

covered already.

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

So you know, one, we think
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there is a categorical difference between this kind of

2

crime which has as an element avoidance custody, and all

3

of the ordinary crimes that you're talking about.

4

even if you go and set that aside and don't draw that

5

categorical line, and you look at, well, what's the risk

6

of violence, here what you've got is you've got you know

7

that they are going to come after him; he knows they are

8

coming; he is already deliberately, he has already

9

indicated his unwillingness to submit to custody; they

But

10

know that; so they come prepared for resistance.

11

Illinois he is by definition a recidivist felon if he

12

has committed this crime, and those are characteristics

13

that are particularly indicative of dangerousness.

14

we think this sets it quite apart from other crimes in

15

terms of the risk of violence that -- that we are

16

talking about.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

And in

So

Do you happen to know how

18

many additional crimes are likely to raise issues like

19

this under the residual clause?

20
21
22

MR. ROBERTS:

Not -- you know, how many

could be covered altogether?
JUSTICE ALITO:

Or Well after we decide this

23

case, how many more cases like this do you anticipate

24

that we're -- we may get under ACCA?

25

MR. ROBERTS:

Well I'm hopeful that the
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court won't have to decide too many other cases with the

2

guidance that will be given by Begay and James and

3

now -- and now this case.

4

So, you know, it has been -- this case, the

5

Court took; it had been holding the case for Begay and

6

it took it rather than vacating and remanding.

7

not as if this is a case where some conflict has

8

developed after the Court was taken to resolve.

9

think -

10
11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So it's

We

Mr. Roberts, I'm sorry; do

you think a soldier who is AWOL commits a violent crime?

12

MR. ROBERTS:

I think a soldier that goes

13

AWOL -- I mean, the soldier that goes AWOL does probably

14

invite somebody to come after them.

15

harder case here because he is not somebody who is a

16

recidivist felon.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

20

question.

21

It's a little bit

Well, he has to be a

This is one of three offenses for an

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, when he did it first -

22

he could have done it in his first crime.

23

know when did this that he had the other two counting

24

under the ACCA.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you don't

It would only be a crime

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

if it's his third crime and not if it's his first.

2

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, you don't look to the

3

individual person; we're looking to the ordinary case

4

and we know from the elements here that you have a

5

recidivist -- you have a recidivist felon.

6

that there is a risk of -- you know, there is a risk of

7

violent confrontation when a soldier goes AWOL, Your

8

Honor.

9
10

JUSTICE STEVENS:
MR. ROBERTS:

I do think

Sure.

I just don't think it's quite

11

as -- as clear a risk as it is -- as it is here, but you

12

know, I would have to say that there is some risk.

13

Yes.

The -- if I could just address something

14

that Justice Kennedy had raised before about statutes

15

unlike Illinois's statute that has a -- that generally

16

prohibit escape.

17

arise from a holding that offenses like failure to

18

report are not violent felonies is that a statute that

19

broadly covered escape, the result would be that jail

20

break escapes would not be violent felonies under that

21

statute, because the statistics that are out there

22

suggest that 89 percent of all escapes are either

23

walkaways or failure to report.

24
25

One -- one possible problem that could

And so unless the charging document
specifically charged it as a jail break escape, then the
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

general -- something that was charged under the general

2

escape statute would not qualify for coverage under the

3

ACCA.

4

And aside from that, if the Court has no

5

further questions, we could ask that the judgment of the

6

Court of Appeals be affirmed.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

Mr. Hochman, you have 11 minutes remaining.

9

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT N. HOCHMAN

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. HOCHMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

Just to begin with where Mr. Roberts left

13

off, most states in fact do distinguish in their

14

statutes between failure to report and prison break

15

escapes.

16

and you can review them, but there are clear

17

distinctions in the law.

18

escape is somehow going to escape -- escape, if you

19

will, from the scope of the statute as a result of a

20

reversal is -- is unfounded.

These are cited by both parties in the briefs

So the risk that prison break

21

Just to make a couple of things clear.

22

First of all with respect to the sentence, Justice

23

Ginsburg, the -- he was sentenced to six additional

24

months but it was stayed as -- as was mentioned; and so

25

when I was answering that question he did not serve
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

additional time as a result of that, and that's what I

2

was referring to.

3

If you look at the sentencing transcript,

4

that's where the indication is that he did in fact serve

5

out four additional weekends.

6

it's not noted as an additional sentence, punishment for

7

it.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:
weekends for?

10

It's not noted in the -

What was he serving those

What was the crime?

MR. HOCHMAN:

That was the armed robbery -

11

the robbery crime, not armed robbery, the robbery crime.

12

That's the first predicate offense here.

13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:
that?

He just gets weekends for

How many weekends?

15

MR. HOCHMAN:

11.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. HOCHMAN:

Pretty good deal.

Second, with respect to the

19

anecdotal cases, you know, we looked at them; you could

20

look at them.

21

are injury -- there are two instances where there are

22

injury, I didn't catch that, and I apologize if I

23

misspoke.

24
25

If there are two instances where there

But it doesn't change the core of the
problem, which is that the anecdotal evidence
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

produced -- and that dates back all the way to 1977,

2

they looked back at cases -- they are covering on

3

extraordinary broad period of time in looking for this

4

stuff, and there is just not -- there is not a lot

5

there, if there is anything there at all, with respect

6

to injury associated with failure to report.

7

On the core substance of their argument,

8

Mr. Roberts emphasized that failing to report has as an

9

element avoiding arrest, avoiding confinement.

I don't

10

actually think that's right.

11

concealment.

12

nothing about seeking to escape from a police officer

13

who comes to bring you back.

14

fact we don't -- the record doesn't explain why; but you

15

know, it was the November to December period.

16

holiday period of time for people when they, obviously,

17

for a variety of reasons might prefer to spend time with

18

their families.

19

There is nothing about

There is nothing about hiding.

There is

He just didn't go; and in

It's the

Whatever the reason was -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Statistics show that

20

the number of robberies increases during the holiday

21

season.

He just needed to get -

22

(Laughter.)

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24
25

four times.

I thought he did this

I thought there were four.
MR. HOCHMAN:

There were four periods from
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the end of November, four consecutive weekends from the

2

end of November into December.

3

Mr. Chief Justice, that any further robberies were

4

committed during that period.

5

There is no indication,

But the point is -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, there is no

6

indication he meant to spend time with his family over

7

the holidays.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. HOCHMAN:

Not in the record.

It's

10

absolutely not in the record, Your Honor.

11

But the point is that while Mr. Roberts stood up and

12

said it's about avoiding arrest; it's about concealing

13

yourself; it's the sort of person that's prone to react

14

violently; the fact is, that's speculation; and

15

everything we know from the sentencing commission and

16

from their own efforts suggests the contrary.

17

indeed even the dangerous weapon findings of the

18

sentencing commission, I think, should be excluded,

19

because under the guidelines, the mere possession of a

20

weapon is not a violent felony.

21

No doubt.

And

A felon in possession is not -- cannot be a

22

predicate offense under the guidelines.

23

possession of a weapon, which is all you have on those

24

five instances -- by the way, the fact that they did not

25

double-count them as also including four suggests they
46

And so the mere

way.

there to support the Government's speculation.

is no further questions, thank you, Your Honors.
