CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first today in Case 07-513 , Herring v.

United States.

Miss Karlan.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. KARLAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice

and may it please the Court:
In February 2004, the Dale County circuit

11

clerk told the local sheriff's department that the court

12

was recalling a warrant that had been issued earlier for

13

Petitioner's arrest.

14

someone in the sheriff's department physically removed

15

the warrant from the file and physically took the

16

warrant back to the court clerk's office.

17

either then or later in the sheriff's department ever

18

updated the computer file to indicate that the record

19

had -- that the warrant had been recalled.

20

of that police department error, the Petitioner in this

21

case was subject to a warrantless arrest for which there

22

was no probable cause five months later.

23

Having received that notice,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But no one

As a result

Didn't they have

24

some regular system for updating the computer base?

25

mean, I assume it was updated at some point.

MS. KARLAN:

No.

Your Honor.

There was

2

no -- there's nothing in the record to suggest that this

3

department ever does, for example, what the FBI does,

4

which is to conduct periodic audits.

5

one, they would have discovered almost instantly what

6

they discovered five months later, which was there was

7

no warrant in this case.

8

Had they conducted

So this -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So people who are,

9

you know, the warrant is served, they're arrested, they

10

go to trial, they're in jail, their name still shows up

11

as having a warrant out for their arrest.

12

MS. KARLAN:

We don't know, Mr. Chief

13

Justice, because this is a department that as far as the

14

record reflects conducts no audits of any kind to update

15

its files.

16

the joint appendix, one of the things you'll discover

17

about this department is that everyone in the department

18

has access to the physical place warrants are kept.

19

They're kept in several different places in the office.

20

And if you look at page 41 and page 60 of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well then, how did

21

this warrant clerk, I guess is what I'd call her,

22

discover the error?

23

minutes, right.

24
25

She discovered it within 10 or 15

MS. KARLAN:

She discovered it because what

happened is a clerk in another police department called
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and said, is there a warrant for Petitioner's arrest.

2

She looked at the computer list on her computer and said

3

yes.

4

a physical copy of the warrant.

5

where the warrant should have been.

6

She went to another file.

7

She then called the court clerk's office and discovered

8

that they had recalled the warrant which was back in

9

their records five months earlier.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Then this other warrant clerk said, please fax us
So she went to the file
It wasn't there.

The warrant wasn't there.

Why did the first -

11

first person in that scenario need a physical copy of

12

the warrant?

13

MS. KARLAN:

The record doesn't reflect

14

that, but she simply I guess wanted to verify that there

15

actually was a warrant because they were picking

16

Petitioner up in a different county.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Does your argument depend on

18

the quality of the recordkeeping in this particular

19

department?

20

this department had excellent recordkeeping procedures

21

but nevertheless made a mistake in this instance.

22

I thought your argument would apply even if

MS. KARLAN:

That's correct, Justice Alito.

23

Our view is, just as is true with respect to probable

24

cause, the fact that 99 percent of a department's

25

arrests are with probable cause doesn't mean that when
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they arrest someone without probable cause you say,

2

well, you get one bite at the apple or a sort of "good

3

enough for government work" theory.

4
5

JUSTICE ALITO:

You're not asking for

Arizona v. Evans to be overruled are you.

6

MS. KARLAN:
Evans.

No.

We're asking to you apply

7

Arizona v.

And if I could give an answer to the

8

question the Chief Justice was asking earlier that comes

9

from Arizona v. Evans, what happened in Arizona v. Evans

10

-- and Justice Stevens mentions this in his dissent

11

there -- is the clerk discovered there, the court clerk

12

discovered, that the warrant that had been, that she had

13

verified, had in fact been recalled.

14

instantly did is they checked their files, and they

15

discovered four other warrants from that same day that

16

had been recalled but that were still in their files.

17

And so what they

Here we didn't have anything done after they

18

discovered the error.

19

as they say, have gone on their merry way.

20

nothing in this record -

21

They discovered this error and,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There's

Well, there was

22

something done in this particular case, though, right?

23

The warrant clerk notified -- was it the Coffee County

24

people?

25

MS. KARLAN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- that the warrant

2

-- that the information she had given 10 minutes before

3

was inaccurate.

4

MS. KARLAN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

And

5

that indicates part of what we're concerned about here,

6

which is this is a department that was built for speed,

7

not for accuracy.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

your argument, does it?

10

MS. KARLAN:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

But none of that matters for

Oh, no.
You want to make it -- you

12

want to draw a clear line between errors by -- by

13

clerical court employees versus errors by police

14

employees.

15

MS. KARLAN:

That's correct.

We think

16

that's the most workable argument, because what we want

17

is a system in which suppression hearings can be

18

conducted expeditiously based on the facts of particular

19

cases.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

How expeditious would it be

21

-- suppose there's negligence on the part of both a

22

court employee and a police department employee.

23

is the judge supposed to do in deciding the suppression

24

motion?

25

What

Is this a comparative negligence determination.
MS. KARLAN:

I don't think it would be
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

exactly a comparative negligence determination.

2

it -- that raises a difficult question and the way I

3

would approach that question is to perhaps use some of

4

what Justice Kennedy talked about in Hudson as a

5

causation approach.

6

of the police department there would have been -

7

I think

That is, if but for the negligence

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought negligence is

8

irrelevant here.

I think if the police department was

9

wrong, even if they had been very careful but for some

10

reason or other they made a mistake -- so you're arguing

11

for shear causality, not for negligence.

12

made the difference then we'd have to go into these

13

factors that you say are very difficult to calculate.

14

MS. KARLAN:

If negligence

Well, Justice Scalia, I was

15

answering Justice Alito's question and if I could just

16

give a little bit of -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I know you were answering

18

his question, but you want to answer it in a way that's

19

consistent with your argument here.

20

MS. KARLAN:

Well, it is, Justice Scalia.

21

So let me explain why it's consistent, which is our

22

position is if police department error causes an

23

unconstitutional arrest then you should suppress

24

evidence, but if both the police were negligent and the

25

clerk was negligence and the police department's
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

negligence.

2
3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You've injected the word

"negligence."

4

MS. KARLAN:

Okay, let me take the word

5

"negligence" out then.

If the police error didn't cause

6

the discovery of the evidence -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MS. KARLAN:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

-- that's correct.

MS. KARLAN:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. KARLAN:

18

It isn't a matter of simple

No, that's correct.

That's

correct.

16
17

Yes.

negligence.

14
15

-- there is dual

causality.

11

13

Alone, but -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How is it going to

keep JUSTICE ALITO:

How are -- how are you going

19

to determine whether there's error without determining

20

whether there's negligence?

21

calls up the police department and says the warrant is

22

still outstanding, and in fact it's not.

23

them over a physical copy of a warrant, but that warrant

24

has been withdrawn.

25

additional steps:

Suppose the court clerk

And it sends

Now, the police could always take
They could send someone over to check
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the records, to look at the court docket to make sure

2

that the warrant had not been withdrawn.

3

be causality, but it would not determine what they

4

should -

5
6

MS. KARLAN:

So there would

There would be no police error

there.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

--

what their duty was.

8

How are you going to determine where this error should

9

be -- should be assigned?

10

MS. KARLAN:

Because in that case there

11

would be no police error.

What this Court held in Evans

12

is that police departments are entitled to rely on the

13

representations of court clerks that there are warrants.

14

So if the court clerk erroneously sends a warrant over,

15

the police are not required to look behind that warrant,

16

just as they're not required in Evans.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let me give you another

18

example.

Suppose that the court clerk calls up and says

19

-- it leaves a message, gives a message to somebody in

20

the police department.

And they memorialize that, and

21

they say "called up."

And let's say the warrant number

22

is the same as the docket number of this case.

23

court employee says -- writes down "Called up," says,

24

"Warrant quashed in warrant, in case 07-513."

25

-- the police department has a record of the call, and
10
Alderson Reporting Company

So the

The court

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they say, "Received call from court clerk.

2

be quashed.

3

the 513 is not quashed; the person is arrested.

4

who caused that?

5

Warrant to

Warrant quashed in case 07-531."

And so
Now,

You have to have a hearing?

MS. KARLAN:

The police -- the police

6

department person caused that by writing down the wrong

7

number.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

police department wrote down the wrong number?

10
11

MS. KARLAN:

Well, it's the same question as

--

12
13

How do you know that the

JUSTICE ALITO:

How do you know what number

was -

14

MS. KARLAN:

Well, it's the same question as

15

in Evans:

16

question, just like the question -- is a question on

17

which you're going to have to hold a hearing because

18

Evans says if it was court error, there is no

19

suppression; and our position is, if it was police

20

error, there is.

21

How do we know who made the mistake?

That

But that's a very manageable hearing.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Just so I have your theory

22

firmly in mind, you would say there is police error even

23

if what happened was that there was an unpredictable and

24

unavoidable computer glitch, no negligence on anybody's

25

part?

The computer simply malfunctioned, got it wrong.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

It wasn't negligence.

2

police error, and you would say that that counts against

3

the admission of -

4
5

MS. KARLAN:

You would still say that that is

That's correct.

As long as

it's police error, it counts against the police.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why, if there is no

7

negligence?

8

you argue that?

9

least negligence on somebody's part?

10

Why do you need to argue that and why do
I mean doesn't there have to be at

MS. KARLAN:

Well, here's the problem:

11

There are two kinds of negligence you might have; that

12

is, you might have the negligence of an individual

13

employee, or what you might have is a decision to use a

14

shoddy recordkeeping system that doesn't catch those

15

errors.

16
17

So the question is JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, either of those

things are negligence or worse.

18

MS. KARLAN:

Yes.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what I didn't understand

20

is why you would charge the police with anything or

21

suppress a warrant where there was a mistake but no one

22

was negligent or worse.

23

MS. KARLAN:

Well, we have had some

24

difficulty finding any reported cases in which there is

25

a police error of the kind of computer glitch that was
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

just hypothesized.

That is where the machines -

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MS. KARLAN:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what you argued for -

Yes.

What -- you said, it should be

5

suppressed even if no one is negligent or worse.

6

have trouble seeing why you're suppressing a warrant

7

where no one does anything wrong at all.

8
9

MS. KARLAN:

And I

Well, part of what I'm trying

to get at in my answer to your question is it's unclear

10

in that situation whether anyone has done something

11

wrong; that is, whether somebody in the police

12

department programmed the police department computer -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let's just assume the

14

hypothetical -- the hypothetical:

15

malfunctions.

16

MS. KARLAN:

The computer

Well, you could have an act of

18

but this case doesn't ask you to do that.

Could I ask this question

--

24

MS. KARLAN:

It's more powerful sometimes.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Could I ask this question?

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

You're saying that the question is whether anybody did

2

anything wrong at all.

3

this person was illegally arrested?

4

violated the Fourth Amendment.

5
6

MS. KARLAN:

The arrest itself

There is no question that as a

matter of fact -

7
8

This is not undisputed, that

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The question is whether it

can be justified.

9

MS. KARLAN:

Yes.

This was a warrantless

10

arrest without probable cause.

11

Does the government have some sort of affirmative

12

defense as to why it should be allowed to use this?

13

Now, in Evans -

14

And the question is:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's a separate

15

question.

16

is the separate one of whether or not you exclude the

17

evidence collected incident to that arrest.

18

have, in several cases, separated the two questions, and

19

I guess it's difficult for me to see if no one has done

20

anything wrong, no one, why you would suppress the

21

evidence in that case.

22

It may be an illegal arrest, but the question

MS. KARLAN:

And we

Well, that case of course is

23

not this case, and you might want to leave open the

24

question of the -

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
14
Alderson Reporting Company

No, but you have

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this difficulty:

2

should we assume, as I understand to be your theory, as

3

Justice Breyer put it, that you would still suppress the

4

evidence when no one has done anything wrong?

5
6

MS. KARLAN:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
do you know?

9
10

We are asking in this case for

you to suppress when someone has done something wrong.

7
8

Do we have to get into negligence, or

Well, we do know that someone

did something wrong here, because we know JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

I'm trying to answer that

the underlying law is here.

things then?

I wouldn't think so -

MS. KARLAN:

Well, there are two different

--

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MS. KARLAN:

-- but maybe they do.

There are two different kinds

14

of cases where police arrest people:

15

where the policeman is arresting on the basis of

16

probable cause, and there, there's a lot of room for

17

error that is based on the facts.

18

it was Joe when it was really John.

good enough, because that's probable cause.

if we don't suppress when there's no error in the part

circumstance, then I don't understand why we would

10

clearer, Justice Breyer, you would not even find a

to arrest.

existence of a warrant, and it turns out to be there is

The first reason -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, one is that you -

you are stuck with the Arizona v. Evans, which says if

MS. KARLAN:

Well, if it's the court, yes;

17

One reason why is in many departments

officers, sworn officers, who are on desk duty for

physical disabilities and the like, perform clerical

20

tasks.

21

The second is on the record in this case.

22

We don't know whether it was a sworn officer who removed

this -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- this Court, for just a

there is a reason they are called "support personnel".

18
19

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

20

The exclusionary rule under this Court's

cases has always been a balance between the interest in

22

achieving some deterrence of police misconduct and the

23

high cost of excluding probative evidence of criminal

24

activity.

25

back in the box.

The exclusionary rule does not put the error
It does not correct it.
26
Alderson Reporting Company

It serves

Official - Subject to Final Review

only as incentives for future compliance to avoid future

2

Fourth Amendment errors.

3

In this case, where nothing is shown other

4

than a negligent and isolated clerical error in the

5

maintenance of warrants, there is no showing that

6

suppression of evidence will achieve the kind of

7

appreciable deterrence that this Court has said is

8

necessary before the exclusionary rule is applied.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

the point -- and I'd like to get your response to it 27

that if we adopt something that depends on the showing

2

of negligence, that that will require extensive hearings

3

in every case into exactly what their computer update

4

system was, and so on.

5

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I actually

6

think that negligence alone should not be enough to

7

justify suppression, because it would not produce the

8

appreciable form of deterrence that this Court has said

9

is warranted.

10

But I also think that -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I interrupt you there?

11

I mean, why do you say that?

12

just getting outside the criminal law for a minute, we

13

-- we've got a whole system of personal liability law in

14

which the theory is that, in effect, requiring

15

compensation for negligence, even though it is not an

16

act of bad faith or malice, is -- is going to affect

17

conduct.

18

here?

19

I mean, we -- we have -

Why do you assume it will not affect conduct

MR. DREEBEN:

I'm not sure that it won't

20

affect conduct to some degree, Justice Souter.

21

the exclusionary rule requires far more than saying that

22

it might affect conduct, and I think that what the Court

23

should look at -

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I think

Don't you think it's

probable that it will affect conduct?
28
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, if the

unreasonable way in -- in relation to their

that they are going to lose a case.

What they will know

6

they do have -

7

8

we all know, as a practical matter, that that's why

police want the -- the greatest scope to the arrest

power.

doing incidental searches, they find things.

that, and we know that.

15

MR. DREEBEN:

They know

Justice Souter, what I think

16

it's important for the Court to know is that the

17

police have ample incentives as it stands to try to make

18

their recordkeeping systems as accurately as possible.

19

The police do not have an interest in believing that

20

there is an outstanding warrant for someone's arrest

21

when there is not.

22

The first reason is that an arrest situation

23

is a highly dangerous encounter for police officers.

24

It's not one to be undertaken lightly.

25

Court has rules that govern searches incident to arrest
30
Alderson Reporting Company

That's why this

31
Alderson Reporting Company

What incentive does

Official - Subject to Final Review

the police department have to withdraw warrants that

2

have been cancelled?

3

long as they are there, it would justify an arrest.

4

Why not just leave them there?

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, that assumes, I think,

5

contrary to this Court's assumption of good faith on

6

governmental actors -

7

As

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If you put aside good

8

9

10
11

just to leave everything there?
MR. DREEBEN:

12

why they would not.

13

I mentioned.

15
16

If you just think in terms of

No.

There are three reasons

The first is the danger factor, as

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The existence or

nonexistence of the warrant doesn't affect the danger.
MR. DREEBEN:

Oh, it certainly does, because

17

it converts what would otherwise be not a stop at all or

18

a reasonable suspicion stop into a felony arrest.

19

when the police are undertaking an arrest, this Court

20

has recognized that suspects often have an incentive to

21

escape or to use weapons to resist -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the incentive exists

MR. DREEBEN:

15

assume that the Court will make its decision not based

16

on the conduct of Officer Anderson in this case, but in

17

an assessment nationwide of whether the exclusionary

18

rule is necessary because the police lack incentives to

19

keep warrant systems up to date.

20

why institutionally the police do have that incentive

21

and, therefore, undertake those kinds of efforts.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I'm giving reasons

And there are three

23

reasons.

24

they don't have the hazard of felony arrests.

25

One is to reduce the incidence of arrests, so

Number two is?
33

MR. DREEBEN:

The second reason is police

resources.

3

undertake a felony arrest.

4

dedicated warrant forces which seek to serve outstanding

5

warrants, and they don't want to spend their time doing

6

it on warrants that have been recalled.

7

It takes a lot of time and energy to
Many jurisdictions have

Similarly, in a case like this, the police

8

happened to find drugs on Petitioner's person and a gun

9

in his car, but if they had found nothing and taken him

10

down to the station house and booked him, that would

11

have been taking two police officers off the street for

12

an afternoon, wasting their resources so that they're

13

not engaged in the kind of protection of the community

14

that the police force wants to do.

15

And the third reason is that it does not

16

create community goodwill to undertake arrests when

17

people do not have warrants and simply because of a

18

mistake in police records they're hauled downtown.

19

That's the kind of thing that creates friction between

the police and communities.

thing for the Court to do -

MR. DREEBEN:

Upon a -- Not just upon a

showing of an error rate, but upon a showing that a

5

was conducted in a manner so that you could say much

6

more than negligence was involved here.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, if you've got a 13

prima facie case.

MR. DREEBEN:

You do.

I would concede you

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

I think I clarified to

2

Justice Scalia that I think all the Court needs to

3

decide today is that an isolated negligent error in

4

police recordkeeping should not result in suppression.

5

It should not hold today because it's not confronted

6

with today -

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I take it if you're not

8

accepting -- if you're not accepting -- I mean, you're

9

not accepting the proposition that the 13 percent error

10

rate which is not somehow shown to be non-negligent

11

should have a different result, you are saying in the 13

12

percent case we're still not going to suppress.

13

MR. DREEBEN:

I would reserve the right to

14

argue that the exclusionary rule's costs outweigh its

15

benefits even if that is shown in a particular case

16

because there are a myriad of other reasons why the

17

police would have an incentive to improve that.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if you -- if you were

We want to be know how much of that there is

that society is getting by requiring valid arrest

11

warrants and in a probable cause case by requiring

12

probable cause.

13

well, there's a cost.

14

And you can't just walk in and say,
We know there's a cost.

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think, Justice Souter,

15

that the Court has ever looked for an empirical count of

16

how many cases.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Don't you think we should

18

if we are in effect -- if you are making what sounds to

19

me like an empirical argument -- there is a cost to

20

society, cases are being lost, criminals are going free

21

-- don't you think that we ought to have a factual basis

22

to know what that cost is?

MR. DREEBEN:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We've done an exclusionary

because there are very few cases in which evidence is

If the cost is very low because very few cases

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if you take that

11

argument to the extreme, we won't have an exclusionary

12

rule at all, I suppose.

13

MR. DREEBEN:

But my argument today does not

14

require the Court to take that step at all because this

15

is an area in which there is a local geography of

16

incentive pertaining to the accuracy of warrants that

17

allows the Court to conduct the balance in a way

18

distinct from what it might do if it's confronted with

19

police negligence or if it's confronted with a

20

widespread pattern of negligence.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of course, if you did the

22

cost-benefit analysis the way Justice Stewart would, the

23

cost is always zero to the State because they would not

24

have had the evidence if they had obeyed the law.

25

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, but I think, Justice
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Stevens, that form of looking at the question has been

2

rejected in this Court's cases that have recognized that

3

the exclusionary rule has to pay its way because in

4

every case in which it results in suppression there is a

5

cost to society and the benefit therefore needs to be

6

appreciable and this Court needs to be confident of that

7

before it concludes that what the Court called the

8

"massive remedy of exclusion" is applied in any

9

particular case.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We know what the

11

cost was here, right?

Court had previously taken the position that the cost

benefit analysis had to be a systemic one.

Justice Souter, but I'm not aware of any case in which

25

cases result in suppression.

start with a good guess as the baseline it seems to me

you -- you ought to have something more than another

guess to justify the exception.

And if -- if you

Well, Justice Souter what my

11

case comes down to today I believe is the proposition

12

that when we are talking about clerical errors made by

13

the police, there are ample incentives for the police

14

not to make those clerical errors that I've described

15

earlier, such that the incremental benefit of the

16

exclusionary rule which we know has a cost; it has a

17

tangible cost in every case in which it's applied; does

18

not pay its own way.

19

sufficient incremental deterrence to warrant taking an

20

isolated negligent error in a generally reliable system

21

and saying we need to suppress evidence anyway; and

22

Petitioner's argument goes farther than the isolated

23

negligent error case.

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. DREEBEN:

If this

Well, it does matter, Justice

13

Ginsburg, because the police officers that I'm familiar

14

with and the agencies that I'm familiar with as

15

exemplified by the NCIC which is the national database,

16

says that the last thing that we want to do is send

17

officers mistakenly out on a felony arrest where they

situation spending community police resources to arrest

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, Justice Kennedy; the

Court did just that and it began with the outset that

the massive remedy of suppression of evidence is a high

21

social cost that should not be borne by society, not

22

because I suppose a policeman, an arresting officer

to arrest the wrong person:

2

Is the evidence suppressed?

If the evidence isn't suppressed, frankly, I

3

don't see why a clerical official should be held to a

4

higher standard; but if the evidence is suppressed then

5

quite possibly the clerical official should be held to

6

the same standard.

7

well, the answer isn't clear; very often a negligent

8

official -- a negligent officer would not have that

9

evidence suppressed.

10

So you've heard the government say

Well, what is it?

MS. KARLAN:

The answer to your question,

11

Justice Breyer, is if the police officer in your

12

hypothetical was negligent the evidence would be

13

suppressed.

14

officer was a reasonable mistake, that is.

There are cases where the mistake of the

22

He did not

If he is negligent Excuse me, because I think

I'm getting a different view from the government.
MS. KARLAN:

I'm absolutely certain that the

24

answer is if he was negligent then there was not

25

probable cause; if there was not probable cause and one

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the other exceptions to the exclusionary rule does

2

not apply, then the evidence will be suppressed.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

negligence is that he was not objectively reasonable?

5

MS. KARLAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the definition of

That's correct.
All right.

So we've got

this MS. KARLAN:

And the rule we are asking for

9

here -- the narrow rule for our Petitioner is when you

10

have negligent error by police officials, you suppress

11

but as Justice Scalia pointed out in my colloquy with

12

him earlier, that rule is perhaps slightly less workable

13

than a rule that says all error.

14

Now we have given you a workable rule here

15

and we still have not heard I believe a workable rule

16

from the government; because what Mr. Dreeben tells you

17

is that under some circumstances there will be

18

suppression.

19

20

study by the FBI.

21

haven't done a more recent one and it was statewide.

22

But let assume for purposes of argument here that if 13

23

percent of the errors in the file are there because the

24

police are not maintaining their records properly, there

25

ought to be suppression of a warrantless arrest based on

And I just want to make up with factual
It was a

It's a very dated study because they

56
Alderson Reporting Company

that because otherwise you're really telling the

2

department that "good enough for government work" is,

3

you know, one out of six warrants is invalid, one out of

4

seven warrants is invalid, but that's okay.

5

So then what you would have to have in each

6

case is a hearing, and at the hearing we would be

7

entitled to discovery -

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in that -- but in that

hypothetical I think it might be easy to say that the

10

policeman on the beat was not objectively reasonable in

11

relying.

12

MS. KARLAN:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

But Justice Kennedy But that's certainly not

the case here.

15

MS. KARLAN:

But Justice Kennedy, if you

16

believe in the government's rule we should have a right

17

to audit that system to show that 13 percent of the

18

warrants -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I agree with that.

If -

20

to say with Mr. Dreeben that we don't have to decide

21

that today is just unrealistic.

22

whether we are going to adopt a rule that down the road

23

will turn every exclusionary request into a pretrial

24

investigation of the procedures of the police.

25

MS. KARLAN:

Yes.

We have to decide today

That's -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Not the procedures

4

all right, you've been here a while, how many times have

5

these warrants turned out to be wrong, just as simple as

6

it was in this case?

7

first time that I've had this question.

8

The officer is on the stand and you say,

And he says, gosh, this is the

MS. KARLAN:

But one of the things we know

9

from the oral argument and the transcript in Evans is

10

that clerk said this is the first time there has ever

11

been an error, and it turned out there were four errors

12

them made the same day.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

Cross-examine

14

people.

15

You say, I don't think that's right.

16

It's not that big a deal to find out on what basis the

17

arresting officer was acting.

18

These people are under oath, you cross-examine.

MS. KARLAN:

Right.

How many times?

But we would be

19

entitled I think, Mr. Chief Justice, to say to the clerk

20

on the stand, have you ever conducted an audit?

21

says, no, but our system is reliable.

She

At that point I think we are entitled to an

they ask what's a question of law that then applies to

months, nobody tried to serve it during the vast

majority of that time because a lot of these warrants,
