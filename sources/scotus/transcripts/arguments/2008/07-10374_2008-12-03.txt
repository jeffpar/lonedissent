CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Murtagh.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JASON E. MURTAGH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. MURTAGH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

In a 4-3 decision, the New York Court of

11

Appeals affirmed Correction Law Section 24, which

12

prohibits Petitioner from bringing a Section 1983 claim

13

for money damages in any court of the State of New York.

14

Instead, that statute relegates Mr. Haywood

15

and anyone else seeking money damages under section 1983

16

to either bring their case in Federal court or to accept

17

what the New York legislature has deemed a State law

18

alternative.

19

Mr. Haywood to sue the prison guards who violated his

20

civil rights; instead he can only sue the State.

21

provides for no punitive damages, it provides for no

22

attorneys' fees; a shortened 90-day notice of claim

23

provision, 30 days shorter than what this Court found

24

violative in Felder; and provides for no right to jury

25

trial.

That State law alternative does not allow

3
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It does provide for a

2

waiver of sovereign immunity and says that the State

3

will respond in damages.

4

that many prisoners would prefer this.

5

solvent -- I hope they're solvent -- defendant.

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. MURTAGH:

It might be -- I'm not sure They have got a

Your Honor, it is true that

8

the State has waived sovereign immunity for claims

9

brought in the Court of Claims under that State law.

10

But, Your Honor, they haven't waived sovereign immunity

11

for punitive damages or for attorneys' fees, both of

12

which are remedies that are specifically available to

13

Petitioners, to plaintiffs, in section 1983 actions.

14

This State law alternative, even if it

15

didn't independently violate the supremacy clause by

16

substituting New York's judgment for that of Congress,

17

would not actually be a real alternative for Mr. Haywood

18

or for anyone else who wanted to bring a suit against

19

prison officials.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, we can just mark

21

that place in the record.

22

there is some real benefits to the prisoners under -

23

under the New York scheme.

24

think it's preferable than to sue under 1983.

25

MR. MURTAGH:

It -- it does seem to me that

It's -- many counsel may

Your Honor -- Your Honor,
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there may be -- reasonable minds I think could differ, I

2

think, about whether it's preferable to have the State

3

as a solvent entity or the -- or the prison employee as

4

a defendant.

5

on that.

6

But I think there's two important points

Number one, in their briefing, the

7

Respondents have argued that they will indemnify State

8

employees regardless of where the case is brought.

9

the State has already agreed to provide indemnification,

If

10

then you don't need the State as a defendant simply to

11

be solvent.

12

The State has already CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, except in -

13

they said except in cases where the guards are acting

14

outside the scope of their employment.

15

MR. MURTAGH:

Yes, Your Honor.

Under

16

Correction Law Section 24, if the guard is acting

17

outside the scope of the employment, then the case can

18

be brought in New York's courts of general jurisdiction.

19

The important point here, Your Honors, is

20

there are two separate related reasons that this law is

21

unconstitutional.

22

legislature has redefined the remedies available under

23

section 1983, they have, in effect, substituted their

24

judgment about what constitutes good policy for

25

Congress's judgment.

The first is because New York's

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

In this particular case, Mr. Haywood or any

2

other plaintiff in New York State, could bring a section

3

1983 claim in State court, but only if he agrees to give

4

up his right to seek money damages.

5

Congress determined, in setting forth the

6

purpose and the effect of section 1983, that plaintiffs

7

ought to be entitled to both money damages and equitable

8

damages.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Federal court, can't he?

11

MR. MURTAGH:

He can still get that in

Your Honor, it's --

12

Justice Scalia it's absolutely true that Mr. Haywood

13

could bring his case in Federal court and would be

14

entitled to all the remedies available under section

15

1983 had he brought it in Federal court.

16

is not dispositive in this case.

17

not dispositive is that in the whole line of cases that

18

this Court has considered where it has required States

19

to hear actions as long as they hear similar or

20

analogous actions, a Federal forum was available in each

21

of those cases as well.

22

But that issue

And the reason it's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess there's a

23

difference.

I mean, obviously Felder is significant

24

help to you.

But I suppose it's a difference to say

25

they've redefined the cause of action under Federal law
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and said they are just not going to hear it at all.

2

may seem paradoxical, but the latter may be from a

3

constitutional point of view the sounder

4

characterization, because it's obviously not the

5

responsibility or the authority of States to say, well,

6

this is how the Federal law is going to be applied.

7

But it might be their -- their -- within

8

their authority to say, look, this is what our State

9

court system provides and if you don't like it for a

10
11

It

Federal claim, you have always got the Federal courts.
MR. MURTAGH:

Your Honor, under this Court's

12

decisions not only in Felder but going back to Martinez,

13

this Court has said that -- that it hasn't decided

14

whether a State is required to create a court to hear

15

Federal claims.

16

reach that issue in this case, because New York has

17

already established courts of general jurisdiction, its

18

supreme court, the trial level court, that are competent

19

to hear these cases.

20
21
22

And I don't think the Court needs to

These courts regularly hear common law tort
cases, they regularly hear section 1983 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, but `they are

23

not really or at least you can view it as they are not

24

discriminating against the Federal cause of action,

25

because they don't allow the State cause of action of
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the sort you want to pursue either.

2

MR. MURTAGH:

Your Honor, that seems to be

3

the crux of the Respondents' argument.

And I think the

4

fundamental problem with that argument is that, although

5

New York specifically exempts prison -- cases against

6

prison officials, that's not enough.

7

it's not enough is that if you can merely invoke the

8

word "jurisdiction," as this Court pointed out in

9

Howlett, the mere -- the force of the Supremacy Clause

And the reason

10

is not so weak that it can be evaded by the mere mention

11

of the word "jurisdiction."

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's -

13

that's true.

14

pointed out on many occasions, "jurisdiction" is a term

15

that covers a lot of different things.

16

point something starts to look jurisdictional, which is,

17

look, we're not going to hear your case at all.

18

other areas, even if they call it jurisdictional, it

19

really doesn't seem that way, such as, well, you've got

20

to give this much notice or you've got to -- you know,

21

maybe those things aren't really jurisdictional.

22

saying you can't bring the case at all strikes me as

23

really jurisdictional.

24
25

And Howlett does say that.

MR. MURTAGH:

But as we've

And at some

In

But

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

think there are a couple of points on that.
8
Alderson Reporting Company

The first

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is that in the cases where this Court has found that

2

there was a neutral jurisdictional rule, Herb v.

3

Pitcairn, Douglas, Mayfield, and then later in

4

Johnson v. Frankell, in every single one of those cases

5

the underlying rule of jurisdiction did not speak to the

6

identity of the parties and did not address the

7

underlying substance of the claim.

8

that simply talked about how a case could move through

9

the courts.

10

Those were rules

For example, in Douglas neither party was a

11

resident of the State of New York and the New York court

12

said:

13

use our courts.

14

If you're not residents, you can't come in and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's not how it moves

15

through the courts.

16

That sounds to me like a jurisdictional ruling.

17

cases that say, our courts don't sit to hear cases where

18

the parties are nonresidents, both sides; our courts

19

don't sit to hear cases about accidents that happened in

20

Timbuktu, those sound like, we don't offer a forum for

21

that type of case, as distinguished from here, where New

22

York does have a forum, it just won't kind of give one

23

kind of relief.

24
25

That is, you don't have a forum.

MR. MURTAGH:

Those

Justice Ginsburg, I think -- I

think that that is exactly right.

The point here is

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that in -- in -- in Douglas, where the court did not -

2

where the New York courts did not allow any party -

3

where both parties were nonresidents of New York they

4

wouldn't hear the case, that applied regardless of the

5

identity of the employee.

6

defendant was an employee of the State of New York or

7

not.

8
9

It didn't matter whether the

And it also applied regardless of what the
underlying substantive claim was.

It didn't matter

10

whether it was a tort action or a contract action or

11

anything else.

12

weren't a resident of New York, you couldn't take

13

advantage of its -- of its courts.

14

If you weren't in New York, if you

And in -- in Herb v. Pitcairn, where you had

15

the situation where there was a -- there was a railroad

16

accident brought in one county court in Illinois, it

17

should have been brought in a different county court,

18

the Court went -- went out of its way to say the State

19

of Illinois has provided other forums, other State

20

courts where you could have brought this case.

21

And if the State, for example, in the

22

present case had said, Mr. Haywood, you filed this case

23

in Wyoming County Supreme Court and it really should

24

have been brought down in Syracuse, that would be a

25

neutral rule of jurisdiction.

It just dictates where

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the case ought to be brought.

2

By contrast, what New York has done here is

3

that they have absolutely forbidden anyone to seek money

4

damages against a prison official.

5

they did that, as conceded in the Respondents' briefing,

6

is because they don't want prison officials to be

7

distracted from their duties.

8

officials to have to face the fear of vexatious

9

lawsuits.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the reason that

They don't want prison

Suppose the -- the New

11

York legislature said, you have a choice, you can bring

12

a 1983 suit or you can bring this sort of suit against

13

the State, and the State will respond to damages, but

14

you can't do both.

15

Can they do that?

MR. MURTAGH:

No, Your Honor, I don't think

16

they could.

17

jurisprudence teaches us that once a court -- once a

18

State opens its courts to hear analogous State law

19

claims, it cannot then close its doors selectively to

20

Federal claims.

21

Once the State -- this Court's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What Justice Kennedy has

22

asked you:

Say, you could have this Federal claim, but

23

we are going to offer you a substitute under New York

24

law, which the Federal authority could not force us to

25

do, because it's a State waiving its sovereign immunity.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. MURTAGH:

I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg;

2

certainly the State of New York could offer a State law

3

alternative in addition to section 1983.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

No, no, I said in the

alternative.

6

MR. MURTAGH:

Okay.

I don't believe,

7

Justice Kennedy, that -- that New York could force a

8

plaintiff to give up the right to sue section -- sue

9

under section 1983 if the courts are otherwise open to

10

tort actions in similar circumstances.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right.

Now, suppose

12

they do it -- they say -- we are just talking about the

13

State courts:

14

courts.

15

in the Federal court, and we will also give our cause of

16

action where the State's law is violated, but not both

17

in the New York courts.

18

you can't bring both types in State

You can still have your Federal cause of action

MR. MURTAGH:

No, Justice Kennedy.

Once -

19

once New York establishes courts of general jurisdiction

20

that are competent to hear these kinds of cases, it

21

can't close its doors to section 1983 claims for money

22

damages.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it's okay for the State

24

to say, we don't want any tort actions in our courts?

25

That would be all right?

MR. MURTAGH:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's strange.

Why -- but

it can't do the lesser thing of saying, we don't want

15

And I'm going to narrow it down after that

23

MR. MURTAGH:

Justice Scalia, I -- I am not

sure exactly where the line is in terms of the analogy.

25

I think this case is very far on the other side.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

In

other words, because New York State here -- even here, a

2

section 1983 claim, this isn't a situation where they

3

say, we have a court that's not competent to hear

4

section 1983 claims.

5

to allow them to hear section 1983 claims for money

6

damages where there is a prison official who's -- who is

7

the defendant.

9

They simply say:

We're not going

If the defendant here, Justice Scalia, were
a police officer who had engaged in the same conduct,

10

New York State courts would have to hear that case.

11

this is not the sort of thing -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand that.

I just

13

don't understand -- you acknowledge it's okay if it's

14

jurisdictional; and you acknowledge that it is

15

jurisdictional if you don't allow any tort actions.

16

just don't know what makes this to be

17

non-jurisdictional.

18

So

I

I don't know.

MR. MURTAGH:

I think it -- intellectually,

19

Justice Scalia, it seems to me that the distinction is

20

that -- that there has to be a point at which you do

21

respect the relative authority of the State and the

22

Federal Governments.

23

are not going to require that a State establish a court

24

to hear a whole kind of action that they otherwise

25

wouldn't hear, that's providing some deference to the

By saying that a State may -- we

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

authority of the State, as the Respondents point out,

2

part of the core sovereignty of the State, to establish

3

their courts and to run their courts.

4

By contrast, once they have done that, once

5

they provided that court system, then the power balance

6

shifts.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if this were at

8

the beginning of whenever New York was establishing a

9

court system, and they said from the outset, look, we

10

are not going to hear these types of cases, then this

11

would be okay?

12

MR. MURTAGH:

Your Honor, I think under this

13

Court's jurisprudence that would -- if the State of New

14

York said we are not going to hear any kind of tort

15

action, regardless of whether it's Federal or State, and

16

it doesn't -

17
18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
mixing the two points.

No, no, that's

Your point I understand it -

19

MR. MURTAGH:

Okay.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- is that once the

21

court has opened it up to a particular type of claim,

22

they can't say, say no more.

up -- obviously we are not going to go back to whenever

the New York State courts was established.

3

MR. MURTAGH:

As long as -- as long as the

4

withdrawal of jurisdiction was across all analogous

5

State law claims as well as the Federal claim, then,

6

yes.

7

good idea or not, but I think -

8
9

I mean, we could discuss whether that would be a

No, we would discuss what

is analogous.

10

MR. MURTAGH:

Yes, and that's -- that's a

11

very good point, Justice Scalia; and this Court has told

12

us as litigants what it thinks are analogous claims.

13

Felder, this Court said an analogous claim for purposes

14

of section 1983 is a common law tort.

15

that's most like a section 1983 claim.

16

question here is does New York State provide courts that

17

can hear common law tort claims?

18

this case that they do.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's the thing
So the real

There is no dispute in

8
9
10

So all they are doing is recognizing the

So really where this case belongs is in the
court that hears claims against the State of New York.
MR. MURTAGH:

Justice Ginsburg, the problem

11

with that analysis, I think, is that in the court of

12

claims there are all sorts of other limitations.

13

This -- this notion that this is simply a

14

substitute claim and that it's just as good enough, I

15

think really is a red herring in this case; because what

16

has happened here is not that New York has created a

17

separate court with specialized expertise that knows how

18

to try these cases, which it probably could do under

19

this Court's jurisprudence.

20

it's required you to sue the State instead of the

21

individual, and then put a whole host of limitations on

22

the sort of relief that you can seek, and on the way

23

that you can bring your case.

24
25

Rather, what it has done is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
what the Federal system has done.

So it's done exactly
So that if you have a

Alderson Reporting Company

2

Federal Government, here's what you do:

4

and in that court all sorts of special rules apply about

5

notice and other things.

6

MR. MURTAGH:

You go to the

7

Justice Roberts, if the claim initially were a claim

9

provide for a claim against the State.

But of course section 1983 doesn't
In Will v.

10

Michigan this Court held that the State is not a person

11

for purposes of section 1983, and so the only way you

12

can have a section 1983 claim -

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but in the

14

Federal system if you sue a Federal official or a

15

postman and in fact in reality it's going to be a claim

16

against the United States, that has to go to the Court

17

of Claims, too.

18

MR. MURTAGH:

And Your Honor, that is

19

absolutely something that Congress can decide to do with

20

respect to Federal law, and New York can decide with

21

respect to State law to do whatever it wants in terms of

22

setting up where those claims can go.

23

What New York cannot do is to impose that

24

policy judgment on the Federal claim, because Congress

25

has already determined 18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess my point is

2

that there's nothing fishy about what New York has done

here.

really discrimination against the Federal claim, it's a

5

rational way to handle claims against the State

to handle claims against the Federal treasury.

Which leads me to think, well, maybe it's not

8
9

MR. MURTAGH:

Regardless of how rational an

idea this is or how good an idea this is, for this Court

10

to adopt a rule that says that once a State disagrees

11

with Congress about how people ought to be liable under

12

a Federal remedy would require this Court in essence to

13

say that the rationale of several of your previous cases

14

could be undone.

15

Howlett that if all you had to do was say, our courts

16

won't have jurisdiction over a certain category of

17

claims that -- the Wisconsin legislature in Felder could

18

have said:

19

there is 120-day notice of claim provided.

20

And I think this Court pointed out in

Our courts shall have no jurisdiction unless

The courts in Martinez in California -- the

21

California legislature could have said, our State courts

22

will have no jurisdiction -

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that just goes

24

back to our previous colloquy about what jurisdiction is

25

and what it means.

I mean, are you saying that if we
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

look at this and we decide yes, this does really look

2

like jurisdiction in the real sense, rather than just a

3

jurisdictional label -- if we do that, then you lose?

4

MR. MURTAGH:

I think that if this Court

5

found that this were a jurisdiction -- a neutral rule of

6

jurisdiction that constituted a valid excuse, that, yes,

7

that would probably -- that would probably undermine my

8

argument significantly.

9

I think to get there, Chief Justice, you

10

would have to -- you would have to sort of engage in

11

some interesting thinking which I haven't gotten my mind

12

around, to be quite honest.

13

in Howlett is, when we talk about jurisdiction, when we

14

talk about what constitutes jurisdiction, we are talking

15

about whether there is power over the subject matter and

16

power over the parties involved.

17

Respondents in this case even argue that the New York

18

supreme courts don't have the power over the parties

19

here or don't have competence over this kind of subject

20

matter.

The -- what this Court said

And I don't think the

21

This case doesn't have any of the

22

attributes, this rule, this correctional law section 24,

23

doesn't have any of the attributes of a neutral

procedural rule -

sort of -- you know, a Platonic ideal of jurisdiction

3

versus non-jurisdiction, and that's what we apply here?

4

MR. MURTAGH:

Do you think there is some

Justice Alito, I think that

5

jurisdiction -- that to determine whether a rule is

6

jurisdictional requires that this Court look at the

7

purpose and the effect of the underlying statute.

8

if all a State has to do is say it's jurisdictional and

9

if jurisdiction is whatever the State says it is, then

10

that means that, going back to Felder and Martinez and

11

some of those cases, a State could -- could evade this

12

Court's rulings merely by reframing the statutes in the

13

words of jurisdiction.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

So what is the -- what is

15

the standard for determining whether it's jurisdictional

16

or not?

17

MR. MURTAGH:

Well, Justice Alito, the -

18

the important points, I think, come out of Felder:

19

it is a neutral rule that is applicable to all cases and

20

that is not concerned with the underlying substance of

21

the claim.

22

cases, Douglas, Mayfield, Herb v. Pitcairn, this Court

23

was looking at situations where there were rules that

24

applied everywhere.

25

That

So, for example, when we go back to the old

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you have acknowledged

tort actions.

of the claim, isn't it?

It's not targeted towards a specific JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it's picking and

12

choosing tort claims as opposed, I suppose, to contract

13

claims.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. MURTAGH:

Yes.

But it's not, Your Honor,

19

can't sue a corrections officer who beats you up.

That's the real difference, I think.

MR. MURTAGH:

I think, Your Honor -- I'd

5

have to get the exact language from Felder, but I think

6

that it is a neutral rule regarding the administration

7

of the courts that is unrelated to the underlying

8

substance of the matter or the nature of the parties.

9

Your Honors, the most recent -- going on a

10

little bit about this jurisdictional issue -- the most

11

recent case that held that there was a neutral rule of

12

judicial administration, a neutral procedural rule, was

13

Johnson v. Fankell.

14

that case, Idaho had a rule that required that there be

15

a final judgment before an intermediate -- before an

16

appeal could be taken from that.

And this Court will recall that, in

17

This Court allowed Idaho to impose that rule

18

on a section 1983 claim because the defendants there had

19

argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity.

20

They lost at the trial level.

21

interlocutory appeal.

22

Idaho can set forth the ways in which you take appeal

23

from any kind of a case, and, more importantly, this is

24

not a rule that is targeted at civil rights claims and

25

in fact may lead to over-enforcement of civil rights

They then sought an

23
Alderson Reporting Company

2

of the case very early.

That's the kind of case where there's a
neutral rule.

5

That's not what we have here.

You are being generous

when you said that we would recall -- at least that I

7

would recall the case.

MR. MURTAGH:

In Johnson v. Fankell, I

Is it Idaho, did you say, or

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It was Johnson.

I thought

you said Idaho.

13

MR. MURTAGH:

Yes.

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

14

I just said that the Idaho courts were involved in that

15

one.

16

Your Honor, the approach that's urged by the

17

Respondents in this -- in this case really would dictate

18

different results, as I mentioned.

19

Felder and in Martinez, the courts could just use the

20

word "jurisdiction."

21

to three of this Court's earlier cases, Mondou in 1912,

22

McKnett in 1934, Testa v. Katt in 1947 -- in Testa v.

23

Katt, this Court required Connecticut to hear an

24

Emergency Price Control Act even though Connecticut

25

regularly refused to hear cases that they thought were

You'd wind up -- in

And actually, even if you go back

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

penal in nature.

And what this Court said was:

You

2

hear analogous claims; you have to hear the Emergency

3

Price Control Act.

4

Now, if this Court were to adopt a rule that

5

the State could simply say, we have no jurisdiction over

6

certain categories of claims, then in Testa, Connecticut

7

could simply have said:

8

jurisdiction over any case seeking penal or punitive

9

types of damages.

If there are no further questions at this
point, I would reserve my time, Mr. Chief Justice.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. UNDERWOOD:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The Federal Constitution permits State

21

courts to hear Federal claims, but it does not require a

22

State to hear them so long as the State does not

23

discriminate against Federal claims in comparison with

24

similar State claims.

And it doesn't matter whether State

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Ms. Underwood, if that's

6

going to be the criterion, that they exclude a State

7

cause of action as readily as they exclude a Federal

8

cause of action, then isn't the State always going to

9

win every case in which there is an issue like this one?

10

Because unless the State is so blatantly discriminatory

11

or so blatantly inadvertent as to leave a cause of

12

action of its own making on the books, when it says, "We

13

won't hear the Federal one," what you posit is always

14

going to be the case.

15

that as long as there is no State action comparable to

16

the Federal action that is disallowed, the State wins,

17

in practical terms the State always wins.

18

18

19

the performance of the correctional officer's duties.

20

Do they then close the New York courts completely to

21

1983 actions against correctional officials?

MS. UNDERWOOD:

There is no jurisdiction in

If they not only used the

23

word "jurisdiction" but gave the rule jurisdictional

25

that can't be waived by the defendants, whereas immunity

Alderson Reporting Company

So it protects courts, not defendants.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Underwood, there is a

3

feature of this case, even assuming that you were right

about -- New York has not withdrawn jurisdiction from

its courts over a 1983 claim; it has simply limited,

taken away, one mode of relief.

That is, you can sue a

That's not jurisdictional unless

you say that every element of damages is jurisdictional.

11

New York allows this type of claim in their

12

courts.

We are talking about jurisdiction over the

13

person?

Yes, they have jurisdiction over the

14

correctional official's person.

16

cutting off is one form of relief.

MS. UNDERWOOD:

different from immunity, both because it can't be waived

it -- because a dismissal won't bar litigating the

5

matter in Federal court.

6

would result in a judgment -

7

A dismissal -- an immunity

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Practically -

8

practically, hasn't what New York has done is to confer

9

on its correctional officers absolute immunity, not

10

merely qualified immunity?

So if you want to be

11

realistic about what is the effect of New York's law, it

12

says you are going to be subject to equitable relief,

13

declaratory relief, but as far as money is concerned,

14

you are absolutely immune.

15

MS. UNDERWOOD:

I don't think it's immunity.

I think it's a refusal to hear the case.

What other reason is

First of all, these -- this

-- I would like to correct an observation.

19

This law does predate the -- not the enactment of 1983,

20

but the proliferation, the use -- the widespread use of

21

1983; and in fact it affects a great many State cases.

22

It's not only -

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

This -- this

But Testa v Katt was a case

24

in which the Court found that the State allows some

25

State action that are analogous to the Federal action
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and you can't discriminate against a Federal action.

2

MS. UNDERWOOD:

That's true.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is not that case.

4

This is a case where the State doesn't allow -- doesn't

5

allow -- damage actions like the Federal action -

6

MS. UNDERWOOD:

If -

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and this Court has not

8

decided to my knowledge how we apply the basic rule in

9

such a situation.

So I would think that the way we

10

would apply it is take the standard and ask the State,

11

what is the neutral administrative-related reason?

12

Because what they are saying is, if you look at this,

13

from an administrative point of view, it's that

14

3

That is a very large and burdensome amount

4

of litigation, unlike litigation against State police,

5

which some have said is comparable, which is dispersed

6

all over the State.

7

large prisons are; and it is a reasonable decision -- a

neutral reason, if you will -- for the State to decide

9

to take those actions out of the courts of general

This is concentrated where the

states closed its courts to tort actions, that would be

okay.

19

administrative rationale behind it, do you?

20

But I don't see how closing your courts to tort

MS. UNDERWOOD:

No, and I don't believe that

21

this Court's cases about jurisdiction, as distinguished

22

from its cases about case handling rules, require that

23

kind of neutral administrative feature.

24
25

I only was suggesting that there exists such
an explanation for this rule; but in fact, this Court
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

has treated quite differently cases about case handling,

2

and that makes sense.

3

the State hear a claim and then impose even a

4

nondiscriminatory -- but it's certainly a discriminatory

5

rule that tends to defeat the claim, the State might

6

induce plaintiffs to bring their claims in State court

7

and then lose them under disadvantageous procedures.

8
9

Because if you hear a claim -- if

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose that the State of

New York said that in suits against corrections -

I think once the State

22

opens its doors to a damage action against corrections

23

officials, the question would be -- the answer might or

might not come out the same way, but I think it probably

25

would come out differently.

The -- the question would be, does that

And so in Martinez, when this Court said
State immunities can't apply to Federal 1983 actions,

only Federal immunities can apply, the Court was careful

to observe that California had opened its courts to this

case and had an immunity, whereas -

undermines a Federal action that is meant to bar courts

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But why can't it be argued

here that Congress has an important mechanism in holding

prison officials -- prison correctional officers -

personally liable, so that they are themselves aware

that they have a constitutional obligation that is

That hasn't been your argument so far.

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, what I'm saying is to

the extent -- I don't believe we need to -- if you think

that we need to -- that there may be a conflict with a

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if the State

Do you think -

7

consistently with our FELA cases it could have a rule

8

that no tort -- no tort cases may be brought by railroad

9

employees against the railroad in a State court.

10

MS. UNDERWOOD:

State or Federal.

There is

11

nothing in your FELA cases that says that as long as the

12

State is closing its doors equally.

13

course, political reasons -

And there are, of

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That is not

That

If you leave the door open

7

to suits against every other possible defendant except

8

railroads?

9

really the FELA cases here.

10

I mean, it seems to me your hardest case is

MS. UNDERWOOD:

I think the FELA cases, some

11

of which were -- some exclusions were upheld and some of

12

which were struck down, support our position, because

13

they only strike down exclusions of jurisdiction where

14

there is a discrimination, where the Court finds a

15

discrimination between the Federal and State claim.

16

In Mondou, Connecticut was hearing suits

17

against railroads under State law.

18

suits against railroads under other States' law that

19

imposed -- liability, but it was refusing to hear only

20

suits under Federal law.

21

struck it down.

22

It was even hearing

And that's why the Court

Similarly, in McKnett and in Testa, in each

23

case this Court struck down in limitation on the

24

ground -- not that the State had an absolute obligation

25

to hear the Federal claim, but that it had an
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

obligation, if it was going to exclude jurisdiction, to

2

exclude it evenhandedly.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that in Testa

4

the State said we are evenhanded, we don't bring -- we

5

don't allow penal actions to be -- to be brought on the

6

civil side of our court?

7

MS. UNDERWOOD:

But what -- but what this

8

Court pointed to in Testa was that while they said that,

9

they did, in fact, hear pun -- double damage actions,

10

which is what this was.

11

being a criminal, but as being a double damage -- a

12

multiple damage action.

13

It was penal in a sense not of

And what the Court said was because Rhode

14

Island does hear double damage actions arising under its

15

own law and under the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act,

16

essentially the rational they gave for excluding the

17

Emergency Press Control Act had been proven false and

18

must -- unless as the only explanation unwillingness to

19

enforce the emergency press control.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what you have now is you

21

have one reason, I think, would be clearly wrong; I

doors to this kind of suit because they say we think our

24

correctional officers should be immune from damages, now

25

we know they can get money under the Federal law, but we

But if the State closed their

2

discrimination against the suit if that were their

3

reason.

4

That, I think, would be

Now, there is a neutral reason, and it's

5

demonstrated, and it is, well, you see, there are just

6

too many -- there are just too many lawsuits by

7

prisoners against prison officials.

8

all that business in that court, and here's how we deal

9

with it.

10

And we don't want

One, we take away their cause of action,

11

that's what we do under State law, and then we -- the

12

feds -- we throw them back to Fed court?

13
14
15

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Without -

Or -- or we offer them a

court of claims.
JUSTICE BREYER:

You don't offer them a

16

court of claims, because what you offer in the court of

17

claims is an action against the State.

18

that isn't a big deal because after all, most of these

19

really are actions against the State anyway, because

20

they get compensated.

21

And you can say

Okay, so if I treat that as neutral, I have

22

one bad reason and one good reason.

And how do I know

23

which is which?

24

are a lot of suits brought in State courts in places

25

with prisons under 1983 for damages rather than Federal

That is, is it really true that there

41
Alderson Reporting Company

courts?

2

looked them up at all?

3

I don't know what the numbers are?

suits against -

Have you

Well, they aren't -- this is

I think 1983, they are -- I mean,

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- 1983 actions, but maybe

they bring them mostly in Federal court.
MS. UNDERWOOD:

They do bring them in

Federal court.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So one way to test

11

this out would be the following:

12

knew, you know, about how many State -- how many damage

13

actions against prisoners were being brought in State

14

courts in districts that have prisons there, and then we

15

saw how much New York was really hurting and then we

16

asked another question, maybe there is some Federal

17

security actions, you see, where there is no State

18

comparable action and we found out, well, the State lets

19

them bring these actions in State court.

20

ways of dealing with this empirically.

21

sense of it?

22

MS. UNDERWOOD:

If we had numbers and

So, there are

that there are a great many State law -- I can't tell

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Even in Monell -- even in

Monell there is no punitive damages against the State,

11

Because the prisoner could get punitive damages against

12

the correctional officer but not against the State in

13

either court.

14

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Where he can -- where he can

15

bring his 1983 action, he can get punitive damages.

16

otherwise.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

2

MS. UNDERWOOD:

In county Yes.

In fact, what I was

3

going to say is that one of the things that shows there

4

is no congressional policy focused only on individuals

5

is that municipalities and other government entities are

6

proper defendants.

7

government -- the Federal policy was -- found by this

8

Court in construing 1983 for not making the State a

9

defendant was not that that would undermine deterrent

The State is not.

Likely, the

10

and that it was preferable to sue individuals, but that

11

there was some reluctance -- concern about power or

12

wisdom of -- of imposing liability on the States.

13

And, in fact, that is what this Court said

14

in Monell and Will about why the State is not a person.

15

So I don't think 1983 is fairly read as embracing a

16

congressional judgment that it's better to have

17

liability against individuals, better from the

18

plaintiffs' point of view, than against the State.

19

But the way this works is it is, in effect,

20

a mandatory removal.

21

objection and has not prohibited removal the way it did

22

in FELA cases, it's hard to see how the congressional

23

policy is frustrated by this mandatory removal.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JASON E. MURTAGH

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. MURTAGH:

Mr. Chief Justice, just very

4

briefly, General Underwood just mentioned that -- that

5

this could be analyzed as a mandatory removal statute.

6

But the distinction, Your Honors, is that what New York

7

State does when it removes these cases to Federal court

8

is it uses an avenue that is provided by Congress.

9

certainly, if Congress wants to provide for removal to

10

And,

Federal court, Congress can do that.

11

What the State cannot do is come in and

12

interpose its policy judgment over and above what

13

Congress has decided with respect to Federal claims.

14

Very quickly, I would like to address the

15

second point.

General Underwood pointed out that there

16

are a lot of large prisons in rural counties in New York

17

State; and, therefore, there are a lot of cases that

18

might be brought in those courts.

19

in this case, Your Honors, that if New York wanted to

20

have a statute that said those cases will be transferred

21

to the less busy courts of our State, that would be

22

okay.

23

administration related to the operation of the courts

24

that is unrelated to the substance or the identity of

25

the parties.

There is no dispute

That would be a neutral rule of judicial

57

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In that same act they

2

might rescind the -- the laws allowing the State to

3

respond in damages, in which case you won't obtain very

4

much.

5

MR. MURTAGH:

Well -- well, Your Honor, my

6

client can't bring his Section 1983 claim in any State

7

court because he can't bring it against the employees,

8

because Correctional Law Section 24 keeps him out of the

9

supreme court.

And he can't sue the you State in the

10

court of claims because in Will v. Michigan this Court

11

said the State is not a person.

12

bring his Federal action in any State court if he wants

13

money damages.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So he simply cannot

I find it hard to regard

15

this as a non-neutral law when it was put on the books

16

before there were any of these 1983 actions.

17

MR. MURTAGH:

Well, Justice Scalia, the -

18

the very first iteration of this law was in 1947.

19

law was actually amended -- and it is discussed in -- in

20

the joint appendix and there is some in the beginning of

21

our brief -- in the early 1970's after there were a

22

significant number of -- of Section 1983 claims that had

23

begun to be filed.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- the one that's currently enforced?

2

MR. MURTAGH:

Justice Ginsburg, I don't

3

recall whether there were any.

We actually researched

4

the legislative history and had a bit of difficulty

5

going back that far.

6

a lot of substantive changes or not, quite honestly.

I don't recall whether there were

7

This is a statute, though, that the -- that

8

the New York Legislature has -- has dealt with over the

9

years.

10

One of the important things is that in the

11

1970's -- and I apologize for not having the exact date

12

-- the New York Legislature said that the purpose of

13

this was to provide immunity to corrections officials.

14

And as we pointed out in our briefing, there is a bill

15

currently pending before the New York Legislature that

16

says we want to extend the same immunity that we provide

17

to prison officials to employees of the Office of -

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

also saying there is a neutral reason.

20

reason is the State sees there are just too many cases

21

in which prisoners are suing correctional officials.

22

So then they say:

They are saying -- they are
The neutral

Here's what we are going

23

to do about it.

First, under State law, we will wipe

24

out all the suits and give them instead an action

25

against the State.

But we know there are still some
59

Federal cases about the same thing.

So what we are

2

going to do is we are going to say bring them in Federal

Why bring them in State court?

5

So now we've

10

why isn't -- or why is -- I guess that's the question

for me:

reason or not?

Is this an adequate, neutral, administrative

MR. MURTAGH:

No, Justice Breyer.

The -

14

the reason that is given in this particular case, if you

15

-- if you go through the Respondent's briefing, the

16

reason that is given is that there -- is that this

17

statute exists because there are lots of frivolous,

18

vexatious lawsuits.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, forget all of the

20

characterizations.

If we could look into the motive,

21

maybe we would have a different view.

23

people who are charged with defending those statutes

MR. MURTAGH:

Now, what's

And I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.

The reason?
JUSTICE BREYER:

The reason is, you see,

6

there are so many cases in which the person is suing -

7

the prisoner is suing the prison official that our

8

courts are clogged.

9

One, give the prisoners a good remedy under State law in

So what we are going to do is:

10

a different court; and, two, close our doors to the

11

comparable Federal case.

12

MR. MURTAGH:

Justice Breyer, the answer is

13

that the State can certainly do that with respect to the

14

State-law claims.

15

What it can't do is try to shuttle Federal

16

claims off to the Federal courts and close its doors for

17

a hearing on similar State claims.
