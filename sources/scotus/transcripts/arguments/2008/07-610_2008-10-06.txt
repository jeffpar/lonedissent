ORAL ARGUMENT OF W. JAMES YOUNG

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. YOUNG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

This case addresses whether the First and

11

Fourteenth Amendments permit public employers to compel

12

nonunion employees to subsidize the union's expressive

13

speech of a political nature in a public forum,

14

specifically litigation in courts and before

15

administrative agencies not involving their bargaining

16

unit.

17

We submit that the answer to this question

18

is no, a result supported by the Court's unanimous,

19

unambiguous, and categorical holding in Ellis.

20

Ellis, this Court held that, to avoid constitutional

21

problems, nonmembers under the Railway Labor Act could

22

not be forced to subsidize any litigation not arising

23

within their bargaining unit, not even litigation to

24

enforce another bargaining unit's agreement in

25

bankruptcy proceedings.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But, of course, they

wouldn't be subsidizing it if -- if, indeed, it is some

kind of a -- essentially an insurance scheme.

Justice Scalia, but my answer to your question -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It doesn't seem to me fair

to call it "subsidizing" if, in fact, that's what's

It's

the local union can make any demands upon the -- upon

20

the national union for -- for litigation defense?

21

MR. YOUNG:

I guess we

Well, I think we can rely,

22

Justice Scalia, on the admissions contained in MSEA's

brief, which clearly concedes that, in fact, SEIU has no

24

enforceable obligations under its affiliation

arrangement with MSEA.

"insurance," can we all it "pooling"?

what they call it, Justice Kennedy.

pooling is -- is certainly something that we believe the

6

Court rejected in Ellis when it set forth a categorical

7

rule.

The pooling argument was raised in the
briefs in Ellis, and this Court did not see fit to -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Young, I thought that

11

in Ellis the litigation -- the Ellis Court said that

12

that litigation did not have as its subject matter

13

negotiation or administration of a collective bargaining

14

contract.

15

MR. YOUNG:

I don't believe that's the case,

16

Justice Ginsburg, because Ellis dealt with enforcing a

17

bargaining agreement.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm quoting from -- I'm

19

quoting from that decision at page 453.

20

involved litigation "not involving negotiation or

21

administration of a collective bargaining contract."

22

MR. YOUNG:

The case

23

Ginsburg, the -- some of the litigation did involve

MR. YOUNG:

Well, no, Justice Alito.

believe -- we believe that the -- the Ellis standard is

the constitutional standard as both principal opinions

5

in Lehnert discuss.

6

In -- in Lehnert, Justice Blackmun

7

specifically recognized it in his -- in his plurality

opinion; and Justice Scalia himself said there was good

9

reason -- good cause to treat Ellis as stating the

take that as -- as -- as meaning that the union couldn't

MR. YOUNG:

Real insurance, Justice Souter?

I think that -- obviously that would be a JUSTICE SOUTER:

Some of those -- some of

17

those premiums are going to subsidize the defense in -

18

in -- in cases beyond this bargaining unit.

most of it will.

MR. YOUNG:

In fact,

Well -- but the distinction,

21

Justice Souter, I think is discussed in the brief,

23

one thing, it would not be the labor union that would be

JUSTICE SOUTER:

5

the part of the parent to come in and defend in -- if

6

litigation arose in this unit, that would still be bad?

13

Souter.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then -- and -- and -- and

15

you do take the position that a -- a genuine insurance

16

policy issued by an insurer would not violate the

constitutional standard?

our argument, Justice Souter.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even though -- even

21

though there may be a great disconnect between the

premiums and the needs of the particular unit?

2

insurance premiums rise dramatically because of very

hostile and extended litigation by another unit.

5

MR. YOUNG:

Do you

I -- I don't think -- well, I

don't think I would concede the premise of your

question says:

Can a -- can a -- a local that is

need this insurance nearly as much as other locals -

22

can it enter into an insurance arrangement with other

I -- my point -- if it is

25

true insurance, insurance where there is mutuality of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

obligation.

2

The difficulty that this Court, I believe,

3

found in the Ellis case when it set a bright-line test

4

was that it was public -- and I -- and I think can be

5

discerned from the Court's other cases, including

6

Glickman -- is we're talking about public speech, speech

7

of a political nature in a public forum.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, there was -- there

was mutuality of obligation in the hypothesis that I

10

gave you in which the agreement with the parent union

11

required an affirmative obligation of the parent union

12

to come in and defend if litigation arose.

13

that still would not be constitutional.

14

MR. YOUNG:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And you said

And I -- and I So the -- so the criterion

16

has got to be something other than mutuality of

17

obligation, right?

18
19
20
21
22

MR. YOUNG:

And it assuredly is, Justice

Souter.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

And what is the other

distinction?
MR. YOUNG:

The other distinction has to be

23

that it is not -- it is -- the problem also arises from

24

the nature of the forced relationship.

25

has recognized in cases such as Ellis and Abood,
12
Alderson Reporting Company

As this Court

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

allowing the agency shop at all works an infringement on

2

First Amendment rights.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We -- we -- we start with

4

that premise, but what is the other distinction, then?

5

If it is not mutuality of obligation, what -- what is

6

the -- what is the -- the -- the -- the point that

7

separates the -- the sheep from the goats here?

8

10
11

MR. YOUNG:

Well, the mutuality of

obligation coupled with true rate setting in the sense
that there is a -- there is JUSTICE SOUTER:

What -- what is -- what has

12

rate setting got to do with -- with your basic point?

13

Your basic point, as I understand it, is that some of

14

the money that's being taken from the -- from the local

15

union and in our example subsidized by the service fee

16

is being used to subsidize litigation for other unions.

17

And that is, it seems to me, exactly true in the

18

insurance case.

19

Some of those premiums will subsidize

20

litigation -- speech -- involving speech in -- in other

21

union bargaining areas.

22

MR. YOUNG:

What's the distinction?
Well, the distinction, Justice

23

Souter, would be that there is -- it doesn't seem to me

24

that there is a -- there is a larger pool created than

25

just a union litigation pool in the insurance context.

16

13

course, it's been adopted through Abood to apply to the

Ellis said it was too attenuated, but because it is

acceptably chargeable -- I think the presumptive -- I

25

think the default value in this Court's decisionmaking
21
Alderson Reporting Company

on litigation is that it's nonchargeable.

duties as, not related to but in performance of the

law imposes the union as a bargaining agent.

4

Why did you say that?

5

MR. YOUNG:

Well, I think -- well, Justice

6

Souter, that arises from the Court's determinations on

7

things like public relations and lobbying and the

distinction it makes, the distinction for instance in

Lehnert between the teacher's voice articles and the

reserve public education program.

11

from that, the different, differing results is that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMIAH A. COLLINS

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. COLLINS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
When this Court in Abood described the kinds
of expenditures that bargaining agents are are required

10

to engage in and that necessitate a rule that requires

11

all represented employees including objecting nonmembers

12

to pay their share services of lawyers is what the court

13

first mentioned.

14

in this case is whether a local bargaining agent that's

15

confronted with the need to pay for those services of

16

lawyers to draw upon legal expertise in bargaining

17

related matters is required to go it alone rely solely

18

on its open resources and its own expertise or -

19

The single narrow question presented

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's not what

20

we are talking about.

It doesn't have to go it alone.

21

It simply can't force members of another unit that can

22

decide they are happy to support it but the members who

23

don't want to support it who don't like unions, they

24

can't be forced to pay for it if it does not relate to

25

their collective bargaining agreement.
27
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. COLLINS:

But the question Mr. Chief

2

just sis whether that, I should add if that unit wants

3

to not neither go it alone nor give a free ride to

4

objecting nonmembers can they avail itself.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If the litigation is

6

not germane to the unit where people object to that

7

unit's collective bargaining agreement they are not free

8

riding on anything.

9

MR. COLLINS:

They are free riding on the

10

same thing that Lehnert says they cannot free ride on.

11

Lehnert as Mr. Young acknowledges certainly holds that

12

as a general proposition when a local union bargaining

13

agent is determining how to finance germane expenditures

14

that it will incur germane to its unit, it can either

15

obviously go it alone rely on its own resources or it

16

can enter into an affiliation relationship where it will

17

pay an affiliation fee the -- of which will be measured

18

by the tote chargeable expenditures incurred by the

19

National Union in other bargaining units as well as when

20

it's the local's own unit.

21

that situation cannot fairly be described as requiring

22

the objective nonmember to subsidize other units.

23

What Lehnert teaches is that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if there is no

24

-- I guess I'm getting into the solace thor general's

25

position here.

What if the unit with the objective

something that doesn't Ben fate their collective

11

was not raised in the Court of Appeals, it's not raised

12

in the petition for certiorari.

13

should add it's not been raised in any other post

14

Lehnert case and I think the reason this issue is not

15

being raised is it's understood I think incorrectly that

16

Lehnert itself did not solve a situation where the kind

17

of showing that the solicitor general and now with the

18

Petitioners would require.

19

did approve pooling of a wide range of expenses the

20

court simply referred to the fact that the union in that

21

case had a unified membership structure which as the

22

court put it under which so many unions operate and the

23

court talked about the essence of an affiliation

24

relationship between that locals can draw on

The second problem is I

union by virtue of their membership in the parent

23

organization?

24
25

MR. COLLINS:

What -- what the Court meant

by that, I believe, Justice Ginsburg, is that -- well,
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

look at the examples the Court gave of what does not -

2

or the Court referred to certain kinds of payments a

3

local union could make which are not part of an

4

affiliation fee payment.

5

The Court talks about direct payments to

6

other locals.

The Court -- the other example given was

7

a payment to a -- a national union that wasn't required

8

by affiliation but was like a charitable contribution.

9

What the Court did not dispute in Lehnert is

10

that, to the extent that an affiliation fee is providing

11

a pool of resources used by the national union for

12

otherwise chargeable services, the potential

13

availability of those services does satisfy the

14

inurement requirement.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose, let's say, that one

16

or more locals someplace else in the country are

17

involved in very, very expensive litigation; and, as a

18

result, the international assesses all of the locals a

19

fee to pay -- to pay for that litigation but at the same

20

time adopts a position that it is extremely unlikely in

21

the future that the international will ever subsidize

22

any other local union litigation expenses.

23

Would the local -- would a -- would a local

24

union not involved in that litigation -- would they -

would it be permissible for them to charge their

MR. COLLINS:

Not beyond -- and again the

2

question isn't presented, but not beyond what Lehnert

3

found necessary.

4

would say necessary to its decision -- that the union in

5

that case had what Lehnert described as a typical,

6

unified, membership-affiliation-fee arrangement; and it

7

talks about a typical affiliation fee where locals pay

8

money to go to the pools of otherwise chargeable

9

expenditures of the national union.

10

Lehnert found it important -- and I

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if you have a

11

situation where there is a provision in the collective

12

bargaining agreement that the union thinks requires the

13

employer to provide air conditioning in the plant, the

14

local up in Nome, Alaska has to support that extra -

15

extra-unit litigation even though it will never have any

16

benefit for it?

17

MR. COLLINS:

Just as Lehnert plainly holds

18

that local would have to support the negotiation of that

19

provision in the first place in Nome, Alaska.

20

the holding of Lehnert.

21

litigation is different, and there is no way that

22

litigation is different in any principled way as relates

23

to the ruling.

24
25

That's

The question is whether

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought it meant

-- I didn't think Lehnert held that the unit would have
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to support that type of extra-unit litigation.

2

I -

3
4

MR. COLLINS:

I mean,

Well, I may have misconstrued

your -- it was litigation over -

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

Yes, there is

6

a provision that is ambiguous, which frequently happens,

7

and the union says that requires air conditioning, and

8

the company says no, and there is a big fight about

9

that.

10

MR. COLLINS:

Well, I think my answer is

11

still correct, Your Honor.

12

well, it does not provide the answer as to litigation;

13

but Lehnert says if the union in the first instance says

14

we want to go to Nome, Alaska and negotiate something

15

about air conditioning, that that, even though it only

16

affects the unit in Nome, Alaska, becomes part of the

17

pool of chargeable expenditures that all units can be

18

part of.

19

Lehnert does not hold -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, sure, because

20

that negotiation is germane to the Nome, Alaska

21

collective bargaining agreement, if they are negotiating

22

it there for that unit.

23

MR. COLLINS:

But the litigation is equally

24

germane.

Petitioners do not dispute that litigation can

25

be germane and chargeable within a particular unit.
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

They acknowledge that; there is no dispute about that.

2

So both the negotiation of the air conditioning right in

3

Nome, Alaska and the enforcement of that negotiated

4

agreement through litigation are equally germane within

5

the unit; the same interests are involved -

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But aren't they, aren't

7

they equal chargeable?

Isn't the unspoken premise of

8

your argument and what Lehnert is getting at -- they are

9

not only germane, but isn't there an unspoken premise

10

that just as the union will support -- the union of the

11

dissident objectors in negotiating a collective

12

bargaining agreement, the union will also presumably

13

support them if litigation is necessary later on to

14

enforce it?

15

So that the so-called standard by which the

16

union's obligation to support the litigation and the

17

unit that includes the dissidents is not somehow

18

precisely spelled out.

19

have some obligation to support the litigation if it

20

comes to the dissidents' unit.

21

that the point of your argument?

22

MR. COLLINS:

The assumption is that they do

And isn't that -- isn't

That's correct, Your Honor,

23

and I want to make clear when the Court spoke in Lehnert

24

of the essence of an affiliation agreement, an

25

affiliation agreement is a contractual relationship.
35
Alderson Reporting Company

raised.

Therefore, how do we identify the litigation that

We have

2

creates no guarantee that when the year -- in the year

3

that we are now in, when fees are being paid, that if

4

litigation is demanded, requested by a nonmember or

5

anyone else, that that local union will provide -

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That

Well, it doesn't create a

7

guarantee expressed like the terms of an insurance

8

policy, but there is, in fact, a local practice to which

9

one can refer.

And it seems, it would seem reasonable

10

in a case like that to say, okay, you can force the

11

dissident to pay a fair share on the expectation that

12

the same kind of enforcement litigation will take place

13

if there is a dispute this year or next year.

14

We don't have, as I understand it, a clear

15

sort of expectation standard when we are talking about

16

affiliation agreements that involve a parent and many,

17

many other locals.

18

is to determine whether there is any obligation at all

19

whether the dissident is getting anything or can expect

20

to get anything for the fee.

21

how do we describe that obligation?

22

MR. COLLINS:

And the point here, it seems to me,

It exists to provide services to local

Absolutely, Your Honor, that's

one thing a national union can properly do.

23

thing a national union can properly do is to say we've

Official - Subject to Final Review

going to have to protect people from a lot of layoffs.

2

But the second point I want to make -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The issue is not whether

4

that's a fair thing for the national union to do.

The

5

issue is whether the person who is being compelled

6

against his will to pay dues to the union is getting

7

anything back for that compelled payment.

8

though the national union may be acting in an entirely

9

fair fashion, given its national objectives, the -- the

And even

10

compelled payment is not doing what our cases seem to

11

say it must do.

12

rendered.

13

It has to be paying for services

MR. COLLINS:

What -- the value the -- the

14

objector is getting is not have a guarantee of services.

15

He has the potential for services far beyond what could

16

ever be paid for out of the local's own affiliation

17

fees.

18

And I would add if a national union were to

19

act in some improper way in terms of how it doles out

20

assistance -- and by the way, one doesn't see cases on

21

this, it's really not in the nature of how national

22

unions operate, because again, we are talking about

23

members and nonmembers equally in terms of who's going

24

to get benefits.

2

3

judgments involved, as Justice Ginsburg's question

4

elicited.

5

There are certainly a lot of

But if a national union were to treat

6

affiliates unfairly, it's quite possible that if and

7

when that occurred, that it might have implications

8

under a number of possible causes of actions and

9

including possibly the right to object.

Justice

10

Scalia's opinion in Lehnert noted that if and when

11

services aren't provided, there might be ground for

12

objection.

13

The question here is is this a basis under

14

the First Amendment to have a prophylactic rule that

15

says we are so concerned that even though we have no

16

rule under Hudson that provides assurance that an

17

unaffiliated local union will provide any particular

18

services to its members and nonmembers, we have such a

19

concern that somehow national unions won't deliver the

20

goods, that we are going to set up the hierarchy of

21

either guarantees, standards, which if the issue had

22

been presented here and we had created a record, we

23

would show the Court -- I think no union in this country

24

has and for good reason, both because of the virtual

25

infinitude of legitimate factors one could consider also
43
Alderson Reporting Company

because of the constant changes in needs of local

2

unions -

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

If certain -- if certain

4

fees are are being assessed on the theory that this is a

5

pooling arrangement, I don't understand why you're

6

resisting any effort to impose any standards or any

7

inquiry as to whether it's really a pooling arrangement?

8
9

MR. COLLINS:

Because, Your Honor -- and the

reason I started my argument by saying there is really

10

two choices, a local union goes it alone or has the

11

arrangement that we have here, is that it simply would

12

not be possible in the nature of things to have a set of

13

standards and guarantees that would be meaningful in any

14

way to govern how national unions provide services to

15

locals.

16

treatment is one thing, but to try to say -- and one

17

could tick off, I suppose, 50 things we'll consider.

18

A standard of basic fairness and equal

We'll consider whether it's going to be an

19

important precedent, whether it's the kind of thing a

20

local can't afford on its own, whether it's important

21

now that we have pressing economic problems and everyone

22

is being laid off, is this a good test case or a bad

23

test case, how broad will the implications of this be.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. COLLINS:

been no argument made that would explain why if you -

if one can pool -- if the union negotiates an agreement

13

with a very controversial provision that a nonmember has

a very legitimate objection to, Lehnert holds that can

15

be pooled.

Lehnert does not say the standard JUSTICE ALITO:

2

MR. COLLINS:

I have two responses to that,

3

Justice Alito.

First, the -- if one had to have the

4

kinds of either guarantees or meaningful enforceable

5

standards that are implied in your question, then in the

6

nature of the beast, it could not be done by national

7

unions, and we would be in a system then when all that

8

can happen is that a local union has to rely solely on

9

its own resources, solely on its own expertise.

And

10

it's doing that despite, as Judge Lynch pointed out in

11

the concurrence, despite the dire impact that can have

12

on its ability to represent people and it's doing it -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it doesn't have to do

14

that.

15

it wants.

16

their money if it wishes.

that portion of the union income which comes from people

18

who don't want to join the union.

19

It can use the money of its union members any way
It can contribute to the national all of

MR. COLLINS:

We are only talking about

Well, then it either has to

20

allow for -- the union has to either conclude we are

21

going to support all of our germane activities, all of

22

our chargeable activities through our own funding and

23

our own resources, and if that's just inadequate and

24

therefore litigation needs to be conducted, we can't do

25

it; the employer knows that so it can take advantage of
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

us in bargaining; we are just going to have to live with

2

it; or we can say our members will pay for that but the

nonmembers won't, because the only solution other than

4

using the local's own money is to pay a fee to the

5

national.

6

case, the arrangement is not one that provides

7

guarantees -

8
9

And as I've indicated in Lehnert as in this

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, one of the

difficulties it seems to me is the Petitioner's position

10

with the sort of all or nothing approach.

But you

11

seemed to be taking the mirror position of that.

12

argument is all or nothing on your side.

13

much help from either side as to what the standard

14

should be.

15

word, but we are looking to see if there is some test

16

that we can use that's not all or nothing.

Your

I don't get

I know germane is obviously a malleable

17

MR. COLLINS:

Well -

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I haven't heard from

19

either side yet what that would be.

20

MR. COLLINS:

The -- the question, Justice

21

Kennedy, is whatever the test is if it's satisfied as to

22

expenditures within the unit where the services are

23

provided, can those services be pooled or is there a

24

different test that has to be applied to the pooling?

25

My submission is that Lehnert makes clear there is no
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

separate test.
As to what the test is within -- and

3

therefore, as to the question presented here, one

4

doesn't need to decide on the actual test that will be

5

applied within the local because as your separate

6

opinion and Justice Scalia's separate opinion in Lehnert

7

made clear, even under the narrower statutory duties

8

test there could still be pooling; the definition as to

9

what can be pooled would simply be different.

I'd only

10

note on the question of whether the tests should be

11

germaneness with the two additional prongs as held in

12

Lehnert, or the statutory duties test, that again is a

13

question that's not presented here.

14

it doesn't affect the concept of pooling.

15

As I just indicated

There has also been no confusion, contrary

16

to Petitioner's contention, under the Lehnert test.

17

only issue that's given the courts difficulties is the

18

specific issue here as to why the plurality in Lehnert

19

seemed to indicate that litigation might be in a

20

different status under pooling.

21

this case for reconsidering the basic Lehnert test of

22

chargeability.

23

The

So there is no basis in

I will simply note, however, that the

24

statutory duties test which -- for which Petitioners

25

argue really doesn't make the situation clearer than
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the -- than the germaneness test because the

2

Government -- both the germaneness test and the

3

statutory duties test acknowledge that the union's right

4

to charge objecting nonmember stems from its function as

5

exclusive bargaining representative; but there is no way

6

to sustain logically the notion that that means that

7

only those things that are done in that exclusive

8

representative capacity are chargeable; because the same

9

Government interests that allow for charging when the

10

union is acting as the exclusive bargaining agent have

11

to also allow for charging for those things that are

12

necessary in order for the union to play that role, and

13

to enforce that role which includes things like the

14

headquarters; it includes things like litigation to

15

enforce an agreement, even though in those areas when

16

performing those functions, the union very often does

17

not have an exclusive representational duty or duty of

18

fair representation.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. COLLINS:

I would say there would be a

8

breach of covenant of faith and fair dealing under the

9

10

and of course if a union used an illegal basis for

11

determining whether it would provide services to the -

12
13
14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

Are you saying you

could bring a lawsuit or not?
MR. COLLINS:

You could bring a lawsuit

15

alleging that the union violated its covenant of good

16

faith and fair dealing to its affiliates, if the union

17

acted on the basis of say, race, for example, you could

18

certainly bring a lawsuit then.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

So either -- in these cases

20

everybody in the union whether they're forced or not,

21

has this kind of remedy or nobody does?

22

MR. COLLINS:

Right.

That's your -

And the reason for

23

that is -- what we always have to understand here, is

24

the interest in seeing to it that a local union that

25

pays an affiliation fee will receive services in a fair
50
Alderson Reporting Company

way from the national is an interest that's shared

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not

6

members may think this is perfectly fair, the nonmembers

8

whenever their money is forced to be used for union

9

activities, it's unfair.

10

MR. COLLINS:

So while the

But a -- a member equally with

11

a nonmember would, Mr. Chief Justice, have the view that

12

if it's predictable year after year that for some reason

13

his local doesn't get services from the national union,

14

the national union sends it elsewhere, that member is

15

going to be no more happier -- happy than the nonmember.

16

That's why those things don't happen in the real world.

17

That's why we certainly don't need a prophylactic rule

18

and there would certainly be no First Amendment basis

19

for a prophylactic rule that requires the union to

20

establish what no union in this country to my knowledge

has, which is either a clear guarantee or specific
