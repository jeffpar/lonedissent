MR. BROWNING:

Well, Your Honor,

no question about that, but that increase is not

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems to me to be

a criticism of the majority-minority district approach

16

in the first place.

MR. BROWNING:

Well, Your Honor, it is a

of coalition district, race is the key factor.

MR. BROWNING:

14

that districts should be drawn to protect minority

minorities equal opportunity, just as majority -

course, has left open the issue of whether the Voting

21

Rights Act would protect minority -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, then your statement

that you must always consider race in drawing districts

MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, my point is when

2

you are drawing districts under section 2, of course

3

race has to be considered, but it's considered because

4

the process is not equally open to minorities.

5

Unfortunately, North Carolina has a long history of

6

discrimination, and that discrimination has resulted in

7

current effects in the voting place.

case.

There is racially

There has been -

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I would have

11

thought the possibility of coalition districts would be

12

evidence that the Voting Rights Act has succeeded,

13

rather than evidence that you need to apply it more

14

broadly.

15

MR. BROWNING:

Mr. Chief Justice, the

coalition districts are certainly evidence that we have

made progress towards Congress's ultimate goal under the

that is still very racially polarized.

Well, I mean, the

obvious question when you say 15 to 30 percent is what

number of crossover voters would you say demonstrates

4

that you no longer need to consider race in shifting a

5

coalition district?

case, this Court stated that it was a district-by

Of course, it could

At some point you have to conclude that it's

MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, at some point

17

that's true, that it would be issues beyond race, but

18

here, the expert report and as stipulated to by

19

Respondents, this voting is racially polarized.

20

is some crossover voting, but not enough to say that the

21

effects of past discrimination have been eliminated.

22

That crossover voting is sufficient for this district to

23

work.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

There

You can't say where -- how

much crossover voting would be so large as to make a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

difference?

2

statistically?

3

You can't say where the line is

MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, this Court's,

4

again, decision in Gingles makes clear that that is a

5

district-by-district determination.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that -- that has been

7

stipulated here, right, that you meet the third Gingles

8

factor?

9

point was made that, in one of the cases that you rely

10

on, in Metts, that reliance on crossovers to prove the

11

ability to elect the candidate of a racial minority's

12

choosing undercuts the argument that the majority votes

13

as a bloc against the minority preferred candidates.

14

there's tension between the crossovers on the one hand

15

and showing that the dominant race votes as a bloc.

16

So it's not at issue in this case, but the

MR. BROWNING:

So

Justice Ginsburg, I

17

completely agree that, at some point, the crossover

18

voting becomes so great that you no longer have to take

19

into account district lines.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

21

MR. BROWNING:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Unfortunately If that's the case, then -

-- we're not there yet.
If that's the case, then

24

opponent's test does, doesn't it?

25

one.

It's just a different

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. BROWNING:

Yes, Your Honor.

What we're

2

proposing and what we think is required by the text of

3

section 2 is you simply take the existing Gingles

4

factors and you look at the amount of racially polarized

5

voting, and from that you are able to readily calculate

6

the size of the minority group that would be

7

sufficiently large to elect a minority -- a minority

8

candidate.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose there is 40 percent

10

crossover voting, and that's a little bit -- that's not

11

quite enough for the minority candidate to win.

12

MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, again, whether

13

the third Gingles prong is satisfied obviously is a

14

district-by-district determination.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Here, however -

We can't even say that 40

16

percent would be sufficient in every instance, that that

17

might be -- you know, that might not be enough?

18

MR. BROWNING:

I'm hesitant since this Court

19

has not set a specific limit, and that's, again, an

20

issue that has been stipulated to in this case.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The -

Well, you don't suggest

22

that if there were 40 percent white crossover voting, we

23

would find white bloc voting within the Gingles

condition, do you?

possibility?

Do you think that is a serious

do have an answer to Justice Alito's question.

actionable under section 2?

MR. BROWNING:

Again, the third prong is not

an aspect of this case.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. BROWNING:

So you don't have an

If you are saying that 40

15

percent is a very high amount of crossover voting, that,

16

of course, is not our case, where the crossover voting

17

that is necessary to make this coalition district work

18

is 18 percent crossover voting.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you have racially

20

polarized voting when you have as high a crossover vote

21

as 40 percent?

22

Gingles factors, but it seems to me 40 percent crossover

23

is fairly high.

district courts and attorneys some degree of security

15

about how you determine the first factor.

MR. BROWNING:

I mean, whether you agree with

You don't have any test for

appropriately concluded that a minority group of less

than 40 percent would simply not work, that it would not

be effective to give rise to a minority -- a district in

4

which minorities elect a minority-preferred candidate.

5

There's also a legal limitation.

In the

6

Court's decision in LULAC, the Court made clear that

12

substantially larger than the crossover voting that is

13

needed to have an ability to elect.

14

And here at a minority

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Under your theory,

15

it would be possible to challenge a majority-minority

16

district on the ground that you could draw a different

17

coalition district, maybe more than one coalition

18

district.

19

Let's put it that way.
If you could draw a majority-minority

20

district and you could draw two crossover districts,

21

does the Voting Rights Act impose a limit on the choice?

22

MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, our position is

23

that the -- assuming all of the factors under Gingles to

24

be met, that if you have a minority group that was

25

packed in to a -- one district, and in its place two
13
Alderson Reporting Company

coalition districts could be effectively drawn, and

2

those districts would actually work and you could meet

all of the other standards under Gingles -- the district

was geographically compact, there is -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's an easy -- I

6

suspect that's a common hypothetical.

7

8

have, as you have here, two 40 percent districts.

9

the Voting Rights Act requires what?

10

MR. BROWNING:

You could draw a

And

In that situation, assuming

11

you could meet all of the Gingles factors, that, yes,

12

that 80 percent district should be drawn as two 40

13

percent districts.

14
15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Aren't you adopting the

principle of maximization?

16

MR. BROWNING:

No, Your Honor.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Let me ask you this, and

18

correct me if I am wrong, because it has been a long

19

time since Gingles came along and I may be forgetting

20

things.

21

alternatives you were just giving, one 80 percent and

22

two 40 percents, that because there is not a principle

23

of maximization there simply is not an abstract or

24

bright-line answer to the question; and that in order to

25

get an answer to the question, you look at all of the

But I -- I thought when you are given the

14

other things that districting authorities look to, and

2

you see how they add up, whether we are talking about

3

compactness, congruency with -- with -- with other

4

political lines, and so on.

5

the other things that reasonably can and should be take

6

into consideration when districting is done, you simply

cannot answer the question, should there be two 40's or

8

one 80.

9

And unless you look to all

Am I wrong?

10

MR. BROWNING:

Well, Justice Souter,

11

certainly the -- the criteria that you have referred to

have to be part of the districting process.

13
14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But they weren't part of

your answer to the Chief Justice.

15

MR. BROWNING:

Well, my point is that when

16

minorities are basically put in an enclave, in a

17

separate district but yet it is possible to draw two

18

districts, two coalition districts, and the other prongs

19

of Gingles have not been met, so that there is not rough

20

proportionality throughout the State, yes, the

21

districting body needs to consider drawing two

22

districts -

but I thought your answer was it needs to do it.

MR. BROWNING:

Yes, Your Honor, it would

for that super-majority to be in place.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay if there is no reason

for the super-majority.

answer the question in the abstract.

And that seems

At least, if it's not correct, you

like that it's very difficult, unless you are actually

7

courts, where you can look, you can be clear and say,

8

you know, close enough for government work.

I have always regarded the 50 percent Gingles

9

But if you want us to figure out whether

10

there could be three districts, two districts instead of

11

just one district, you are just, it seems to me, tossing

the whole -- the whole project of drawing districts into

the courts.

I, for one, favor.

And that is -- that is not something that

In this case which way

does the presumption favoring what the legislature did

cut?

is that not right?

Here the court set aside what the legislature did;

MR. BROWNING:

Yes, Your Honor, the North

Carolina Supreme Court determined that this district

21

should not cut county lines.

line was a county line that was originally created to

23

segregate blacks in Wilmington, in the southern portion

of the county, from whites in the northern portion of

the county.

MR. BROWNING:

Yes, Your Honor, that the

2

MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, the plaintiffs

have and the Respondent and the government have referred

4

to an alternative district that would not cut those

5

county lines and would have a black voting age

6

population of 35 percent.

7

there is absolutely no testimony that that -- their

8

alternative district would be in any way workable.

9

matter of fact, the undisputed testimony of the joint

As a

appendix at page 73-74 is to the contrary.

11
12

The problem with that is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What do you mean by

"workable"?
MR. BROWNING:

That this -- that the

14

district they propose was simply prepared by their

MR. BROWNING:

Well, it is a matter of the

percentage of voting age population, but more

-- that this is

designed to protect incumbents.

7

MR. BROWNING:

Well, Your Honor, incumbency

8

certainly has to be considered in the context of what

9

the Voting Rights Act requires us to do, which is to

10

look at the total picture.

11

It is a matter of looking -- undertaking a searching

12

evaluation of the past and present political realities.

13

Is it a functional approach?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Browning, I thought

14

there was something in the record that said never in

15

North Carolina's history have you had African Americans

16

able to choose the -- able to elect the candidate of

17

their choice where the minority population was less than

18

38.37 percent.

19

MR. BROWNING:

Justice Ginsburg, there are

20

districts such as Wake County, the seat of government,

21

where a minority has been elected with less than 38

22

percent.

23

highly racially polarized voting, 38 percent roughly is

24

the effective floor that the General Assembly recognized

25

as being workable for creating a district such as this.

But in areas of the State where there is

I will also note that this issue was not presented to

2

the North Carolina Supreme Court, the issue of whether

there is an alternative district that would somehow be

4

feasible and workable.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, does that mean a

6

proposal if you succeed, we should remand on that

7

question?

8
9

MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, that would

certainly be one possibility, but the North Carolina

10

Supreme Court resolved this straight legal question as

11

to whether the 50 percent rule is in place and is an -

12

is an inflexible rule, and not only did they -- they

13

imposed this rule with respect to this district, they

14

essentially had a mandatory injunction on the North

15

Carolina General Assembly to never draw a district at

16

less than 50 percent if it cuts too many county lines;

17

and that is even inconsistent with the United States'

18

view of section 2.

19

should be reversed.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. THURMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court.
The rule proposed by Petitioners in this

5

case would effectively require maximization resulting

6

in, as the Court has recognized, judicial involvement in

7

many, many more situations.

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

require maximization.

I don't know why it would

It would -- it would certainly

10

open the door to -- to more districts required by

11

section 2 than if we have a 50 percent rule.

12

think your brother conceded that when -- when you draw a

13

district, you are bound by our case law as well as

14

tradition to look to something more than maximization,

15

and maximization is in fact not the law.

16

why it would be required.

17

MR. THURMAN:

But I -- I

So I don't see

Your Honor, in this situation,

18

we take the position that the people of North Carolina

19

and their ultimate authority, their State Constitution,

20

have spoken and said that county lines should be kept

21

whole to the extent practical.

22

is the legislators disregarded that and, based on the

23

cases, based on LULAC, at 25 percent -

12

that's the only point that I -- that I meant to pick -

pick up on.

14

MR. THURMAN:

And that's -

Your Honor, it seems that if

15

there are going to be more potential claims, and as

16

every legislative body, school board, city council,

to take this into account.

absolutely true.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why in the -- why in

4

the world would you stipulate to bloc voting in a

5

situation where you have nearly 20 percent crossover

6

voting?

7

MR. THURMAN:

Your Honor, the answer to that

8

question is we were 20 months into the litigation, we

9

had just received a partial ruling on cross motions for

10

summary judgment, we were already at the midpoint of the

11

decade.

If this Court should affirm the North Carolina

We quite simply wanted to move

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but it seems

17

to me you have complicated situations on a rather

18

critical point, what seems to me a basic conundrum, how

19

can you have bloc voting and at the same time have

20

significant crossover voting?

21

the table, it's kind of hard to address the basic issue

22

in the case.

23

MR. THURMAN:

You take one of those off

I agree, Your Honor.

The

24

other point that I would point out is, it is not a

25

stipulation that there was sufficient bloc voting within

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

either of the districts that were drawn.

2

stipulation was with reference to bloc voting within the

3

two counties.

4

is no stipulation that the alternative district does not

5

comply and would -- and therefore would require the

6

creation of the 39 percent district.

7

The

The district that could be drawn -- there

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, since the district is

8

drawn from the counties and there's a stipulation with

9

respect to the counties, doesn't it follow in the

10

absence of some surprising fact that there would be bloc

11

voting or the stipulation would cover bloc voting in the

12

district?

13

MR. THURMAN:

Your Honor, there are very

14

different populations in these two counties, and that is

15

referenced in the record with regards to the growth in

16

population; and there is very different minority

17

populations in the two counties because of the influx -

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But regardless, regardless

19

of the -- the variations in mix, if you are stipulating

20

that there's bloc voting in county A, bloc voting in

21

county B, and you have got a district made up part of A,

22

part of B, doesn't it follow in -- in the absence of

23

some pretty specific evidence to the contrary, that in

24

the district there is probably going to be bloc voting?

25

MR. THURMAN:

Your Honor, I would
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

respectfully submit that it does not follow within a

2

particular section of a district.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I think we all -

Do you have evidence in the

4

record -- did you put evidence in the record that this

5

particular district is carved from some peculiar section

6

of county A and county B, so that the general bloc

7

voting pattern does not apply in the district?

8
9

MR. THURMAN:

Your Honor, there is evidence

in the record, and it is cited in the brief, that

10

minority candidates, black candidates for judicial

11

office and for State auditor received between 59 percent

12

and 62 percent of the vote in the proposed district.

13

would respectfully submit that that comprises evidence

14

that there is not sufficient bloc voting.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We

Well But you stipulated.

You

17

didn't want to argue the third factor.

18

you just started out by saying you were tired of this

19

litigation, we wanted to concentrate on one issue and

20

one issue only, and that was the 50 percent rule.

21

now you are suggesting that, well, no, the stipulation

22

really didn't stipulate away the third factor.

23

thought you were giving in on that issue so that you

24

could get the first issue decided.

MR. THURMAN:

facts, because I may have misunderstood the facts.

You're saying you did not stipulate that there was bloc

voting; you stipulated that there was sufficient

evidence for a factfinder to find that there was bloc

15

voting.

Is that your position?

And it starts out that, in

support a finding of fact that the racial difference in

the court that it was Pender and New Hanover County that

he suggested what he

MR. THURMAN:

It's okay.

Your Honor, I think -- the

13

perspective -- and I can't help -- that it is not as

14

clear-edged as it seemed to the Court, at least to

15

Justice Souter, that the 50 percent rule does provide a

16

very clear, very limited sort of a rule that can be

17

followed without getting involved in -- I do believe

18

that -- race becomes very likely the predominant factor

19

in the redistricting decision, because based on the

20

cases that have come before you already, there have been

claims that 26 percent, 25 percent -

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't see how those

23

claims could possibly succeed, but I thought -- let's go

24

back to sort of step 1.

25

when I start thinking of these cases.

My mind turns a little confused

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Are we talking

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

about a case of -- where the claim is normally vote

2

dilution?

Is that yes or no?

3

MR. THURMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Section 2 -- does vote

5

dilution mean we who are a minority group, let's say a

6

black group, could have elected a candidate of our

7

choice more likely than the white group, but because you

8

are engaged in vote dilution, that isn't going to happen

9

anymore?

Is that the form of the claim?

10

MR. THURMAN:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

Yes, Your Honor, that is That's the form of the

claim.

13

Then, it's our problem here that to see

14

whether that's so, you have to see whether the black

15

group did really vote as a group.

16

a good chance to elect the person they want, and does

17

the white group tend to also vote as a group and swamp

18

them?

19

Did they used to have

Is that what we are trying to find out?
MR. THURMAN:

Your Honor, I'm not sure that

20

is entirely what we are trying to find out, because

21

certainly districts are created where there was no

22

minority incumbent, and that can happen because of

23

changes in demographics or a variety -

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

that can happen.

There are a lot of reasons

But is the evil we are trying to get
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

at, the evil of a black group, when they stick together

2

in polarized voting, having less of a chance of getting

3

their candidate elected than when the white group does

4

the same?

5

MR. THURMAN:

Your Honor, I believe the

6

answer is, yes, we are trying to prevent that from

7

happening.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:
to prevent?

Okay.

That's what we are trying

If that's what we are trying to

10

prevent, then haven't we learned that putting a

11

threshold, because you can't even get in the door -- you

12

can't even get in the door -- unless the black group

13

accounted for 50 percent of something, the voters or the

14

people who turn out, that that doesn't make much sense

15

for the reason that Justice Scalia started with.

16

doesn't make much sense because sometimes they account

17

for 51 percent, but they can't elect anybody, because

18

they all divide on four different people, or maybe they

19

didn't turn out.

20

account for 43 percent, they could elect the candidate

21

of their choice.

22

pretty arbitrary and we're looking for a better

23

criterion.

so far?

something to measure that by.

5

Well, there needs to be

JUSTICE BREYER:

Section 5 is about

Here what we've -- could we

6

look to see whether the three Gingles factors, whatever

7

they are -- one was, is the black group numerous enough

8

to elect the candidates of their choice?

9

compact, politically cohesive?

Reasonably

And then you look to

10

see, does the white group tend to vote as a bloc to stop

11

them?

12

MR. THURMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. THURMAN:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's what we should do?

Your Honor Then I'm back to my

16

problem, that sometimes the 50 percent criteria just

17

doesn't measure that first part.

18

any other matter would be worse, but I bet we could

19

invent some that were actually better.

20

wouldn't have to go to 20 percent; suppose, for example,

21

you started looking in the 40 percents, and you said,

22

you know, if the black group is going to elect their

23

candidate with 40 percent, or 45 percent even, they're

24

going to need a lot of crossovers, because they may only

25

vote -- you know, only 80 percent may turn out.

And so you say, well,

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Suppose you

They

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are going to need a lot of crossovers.

2

crossovers you have to have, the harder it is to say

3

that that white group is out there trying to beat them.

4

And the more

So there's a kind of natural stopping place.

5

When I worked out the numbers, it seemed that natural

6

stopping place fell around 42-43 percent.

7

fell -- as you said, that the black group -- you insist

8

that the black group had to be twice as many as the

9

white group that crossed over.

It sort of

A little arbitrary, but

10

at least we were getting to the same -- to the right

11

thing.

I mean -- respond as you wish.

12

MR. THURMAN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

It may

13

take me a second to take it all in.

14

the reason the 50 percent rule does work is, at 50

15

percent, there is a claim that there is the opportunity

16

and there is voter registration, voter turnout, a lot of

17

factors that can influence at that point, but that

18

doesn't prevent there from being opportunity.

19

the choice of whatever group is involved.

20

dropping below 50 percent, and then they're not being

denied an equal opportunity.

22

opportunity any other group does.

23

trying to -- because what -- basically the Petitioner's

position is -- the State in its -- position is, it takes

a minority group, and then you find presumably another

the country are all alike, and that there is enough

13

variety in every district and every part of the country

14

where we have this problem.

15

Maybe 51 percent would not be enough.

16

group might, itself, be divided as is often the case.

17

It seems to me that a rigid 51 percent

There are variations.
The minority

I -- I think the underlying premise -- the

18

underlying -- the premise underlying your argument is

19

that all minorities are exactly alike.

20

can have this mathematical figure, and that answers the

21

question.

22

MR. THURMAN:

That's why we

Your Honor, I categorically

23

reject that as a human-rights basis for our argument.

24

That is handled by the third Gingles prong and the

25

second Gingles prong.

And when you look at what the
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

coalition is, what it is, and you look at how

2

politically cohesive it is.

3

percent is arguably not enough under the second Gingles

4

provision.

5

So it could be that 50

But that until you get to 50 percent, you

6

are -- again, it is the way it has been described as a

7

gate-keeping function for us to keep the Court out of

it.

candidates.

something that this Court has endorsed for the purpose

14

of the Voting Rights Act.

it takes, it starts to run into the issue:

16

supportable under the Solomon case, under equal

17

protection?

18

And I do not believe it's ever been

And if that is the position

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What -- what

19

Justice Breyer proposed a rule at the end of his

20

question.

21

instead of 50 percent, it would be twice as many in the

22

African-American population as in the crossover group.

23

That would be the threshold.

24
25

He said:

Suppose you make it, the threshold,

MR. THURMAN:

But, Your Honor, first, I

believe as he said, as Justice Breyer said, that's an
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

arbitrary number that he picked up on, the 50 percent.

2

The reason we would submit that is not simply an

3

arbitrary number is that it does deal with them.

4

that point there is an opportunity, regardless of

5

whether there is the -- what it certainly does not

6

exist -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

At

8

it's an opportunity, and what you mean is it is

sufficient to provide an opportunity.

12

sufficient to provide an opportunity?

13

MR. THURMAN:

Isn't the two-to-one

Your Honor, I would say that

14

that would not be appropriate, because at that point you

15

are looking on -- at the basis of race to give one group

a greater opportunity than another, and the Voting

AS AMICUS CURAE,

17

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

18
19

MR. JOSEFFER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

20

Petitioner has proposed expansion of section

21

2's traditional coverage because of three serious

22

problems.

23

legislatures, as well as the courts, with a baseline

24

against which to when a section 2 District must be drawn

25

in the first place, when to engage in this race

The first is to provide State and local

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

conscious exercise in the first place.
Second, it raises the serious Constitutional

3

concerns identified in LULAC, especially because it

4

combines not only racial gerrymandering but with

5

political-party gerrymandering all at the same time.

6

And third, it requires difficult predictive

7

judgments about how people would react, how people would

8

vote in a future proposed district, something that is

9

not required under the traditional Gingles analysis.

10

And these problems would exist nationwide

11

because section 2 applies to every districting done in

12

every jurisdiction and every -- nationwide, be it a

13

county, city, or locality or down to the school-board or

14

city-council level.

15

Now, under the first of those points, under

16

the traditional Gingles test, the scope of consideration

17

of race and other things, as well as the majority limit

18

of the districts -- and that provides an -- an easy

19

focal point that anyone drawing a district knows.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought you were

21

conceding that it isn't a rigid rule, and that the North

22

Carolina Supreme Court should have to be -- I mean they

23

could be 48 percent, I think you said.

24
25

MR.

We have identified two

narrow exceptions, neither of which the Court really

needs to reach in this case.

2

of intentional discrimination.

3

there is, first, that's academic.

4

prove intentional discrimination, you can proceed with a

5

constitutional claim under section 2 and not add

6

anything anyway.

7
8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The first is an inference
And the important thing
Because if you can

Intentional by those who

draw the district?

9

MR. JOSEFFER:

Yes, exactly.

And there -

10

the point here is because it's not an actualization

11

statute, one needs a baseline to determine if there is

12

the denial of an equal opportunity to elect.

13

fact, what the people drawing the district were trying

14

to do was to deprive the minority group of that

15

opportunity, that is a perfectly good alternative

16

baseline.

17

And if, in

Our other proposed narrow exception, which

18

also is not even close to being implicated here, is

19

basically an evidentiary one:

20

cases where, when you are trying to figure out whether

21

the majority population is above 50 percent, you may not

22

be sure because these are estimates.

23

reliable, but we would impose about a two percent

24

cushion there to adjust -- to account for the

25

possibility that if there is that much evidentiary

That there are those

42
Alderson Reporting Company

They are very

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

uncertainty, it makes sense to have a -- for purposes of

2

that test.

3

However JUSTICE SOUTER:

I don't know if you

4

litigate whether you are -- whether you are really

5

talking about a -- a possible two percent variation.

6

that I mean, I -- I think you have to concede under your

-- under your test that there's going to be more

8

litigation.

9

are under a 50 percent rule.

10

So

There is going to be more claims than there

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, because -- I say

11

actually the opposite because -- well, I think that

12

trying to determine 48percent raises no more difficulty

13

than trying to determine 50 percent.

14
15

better chance so you are more likely to do it.

MR.

JOSEFFER:

Well, in -- in practice -- I

21

mean, remember, the majority-minority rule has been

22

followed in almost every jurisdiction nationwide for

23

more than two decades, and so far I have seen one 48

24

percent case.

25

there don't seem to have been very many.

There may have been others, but there -

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you want an absolute,

2

arbitrary rule, which is what you were heading toward

3

which will just -- - the question is whether they get in

4

the door.

5

the three factors.

6

out.

7

If they are in the door, they have to prove

Okay.

And you want to keep certain people

Suppose you say, well, 42 percent.

8

That gives you down to 40, with your two back, instead

9

of 50.

But you are out anyway if the crossover vote

10

from the white majority is more than half of what the

11

whole vote is with the black and white together on that

12

side.

13

So you have a two-to-one ratio.
Now, the only virtue of that is that there

14

was an effort to try to get an arbitrary rule, which you

15

have with your 50 percent, even -- only a little bit

16

more difficult than that to -- to administer, and is

17

likely to get in more cases that are justified.

18

they still have to prove their three factors.

19

MR. JOSEFFER:

But

Well, there -- there are a

20

couple of things.

The first is that, textually

21

speaking, what the statute refers to is an equal

22

opportunity to elect the -- the representative of their

23

choice.

24

majority-minority rule.

25

yourselves the majority of the electorate, you have at

And at least the most principal blind is the
Because if you have by

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

least in theory the opportunity to elect the

2

representative of your choice.

3

there really is at that point -

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

When you go beyond that,

It takes into account the

5

realistic fact that in every group, including lots of

6

African-American groups, there is -- it is not

7

100 percent African American at all.

8

are a few others who will come along, and -- and that's

9

still the candidate of that community's choice.

10

MR. JOSEFFER:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12
13

Right.

There are -- there

But that's -

So we want -- a little

flexibility here is all that I'm suggesting.
MR. JOSEFFER:

Yes.

The problem is once you

14

go below what is at least in principle a 50 percent

15

line, it's not clear where -- where one would ever stop.

16

And under your approach, I think two exceptions:

17

you definitely open the door down to potentially below

18

42, especially -- in this case, especially -

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

One,

You can't get below 42.

20

I'm not going to get below 40 no matter what, even with

21

your thumb on the scale.

22

MR. JOSEFFER:

I mean -

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

They are -- they are

24

finished at 40, and they are not even in at 40, if they

25

have to depend more than two-to-one on the crossovers.
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. JOSEFFER:

One problem with what you are

2

looking for is a principle rule that can be justified.

3

I understand 50, and I understand the slight evidentiary

4

cushion.

5

trying to determine is now the equal opportunity to be

6

coming out of nowhere.

7

Forty-two really does -- from what you're

The other advantage the 50 percent rule has

is the advantages of incumbency.

In effect, it has been

10

And that has shown that, first, that it's

11

workable; and second, that it does not appear to have

12

13

had, Congress likely would have -- statute over the past

14

two decades.

15

And the other thing -- I'm sorry.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If it

I won -- I'd hoped that

17

you could have a brief time to discuss your third

18

rationale because it's going to require determination of

19

how people would vote.

20

MR. JOSEFFER:

Under Gingles one typically

21

looks at what actually happened in the past.

22

Gingles factor looks, for example, looks to whether

23

white bloc voting in actual elections has generally been

24

sufficient to prevent the election of minority group's

25

candidate of choice in the past.

So, it's a

46
Alderson Reporting Company

The third

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

straightforward historic-based inquiry.

2

Here, however, the state or local

3

legislature at the outset looking to trade a new

4

district based on the prediction that it will elect the

5

minority group's candidate of choice.

6

So, as a practical matter, you start with

7

the racial makeup of some people and the political

8

partisanship of others.

9

because you have to predict turnout by each group,

10

But you can't stop there,

crossover voting by each group.

11

As a practical matter, those things will

12

vary based on who the candidates are, whether there is

13

an incumbent, whether the incumbent is the minority

14

group's candidate of choice.

15

elections, the -- may not even be available, which was a

16

point that was made in the topside amicus brief filed by

17

the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, the NAACP Legal

18

Defense Fund and others.

19

And especially in local

If I could turn to the Constitutional -

20

point.

In that perspective, this proposal is really the

21

worst of all worlds, because the way you construct a

22

district is to take some people based on race, others

23

based on political party affiliation, and the race can't

24

dominate and the majority of courts have also held

25

purely partisan gerrymandering, at least -- aside is
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

also unconstitutional.

2

But this is both.

What you have is

3

nationwide in every jurisdiction, every districting a

4

mandate that requires consideration for both race and

5

partisanship that goes far beyond what has traditionally

6

been required under section 2 and I suspected far beyond

7

what normally happens at the local level.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you have a view

on how we should approach the stipulation adopted below?

10

MR. JOSEFFER:

I think the easy way to cut

11

through is that a state Supreme Court respond and remand

12

all arguments other than the first Gingles factor.

13

the first Gingles factor, based on what happened in the

14

state Supreme Court is the only thing that is before the

15

Court.

16

So,

What would remain potentially unremand is if

17

this Court were to would ban the traditional

18

understanding of the first Gingles factor and impose a

19

new understanding.

Then the adjudication of that might

20

be open on remand.

But Respondents have remanded

21

everything else in the state Supreme Court.

22

Finally, I also can't help but mention that

23

there is a great irony here in that Petitioners'

24

essential position is that back when race relations were

25

worse and back when there's much more racial bloc
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

voting, minority-majority districts worked okay.

2

But now that race relations have improved

3

and there is much more crossover voting, we should now

4

require greater consideration of race as well as

5

partisanship than had ever been done before under the

6

same unamended statute.

7

And if I could turn -- Justice's -- at the

8

outset, a state or local legislature as well as the

9

court really doesn't know where to start.

State and

10

local legislatures are the ones who are supposed to be

11

drawing these lines.

12

administrable rules to follow.

13

are, the better the chance we will have to do it, and if

14

they can figure it out at the outset, the less

consideration of race and partisanship becomes

16

necessary.

rationale -

And if one goes beyond that, there is also no
Here's 39 percent, which

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24

Alderson Reporting Company

2

out -- remember which were much more -- not using the 50

3

4

MR. JOSEFFER:

There are two things about

5

the graphs.

6

those were the districts that would determine the

7

8

10
11

The first is that less compact maps -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But they were designed to

produce 50 percent, and that's why they got so -- so so grotesque.
MR. JOSEFFER:

Right.

Another thing there

12

seems to be a common misconception that our view of

13

section 2 prohibits the drafting of crossover districts,

14

which is not case of all.

15

The question here is what if it is required.

16

If a district -- if a jurisdiction wants to draw a

17

crossover district, then at least in principle nothing

18

is stopping it from doing so.

19

to do was require the drawing these crossover districts,

20

that could create some funny maps of its own, because if

21

you have to reach out to grab jurisdiction wide, look at

22

every significant pocket of minority voters, look at

23

whatever you could put together that would vote alike,

24

which as a practical matter is the same political party,

25

then you are going to be requiring the same dynamics

The States make the point that

2

there are many districts where we have military bases,

we have colleges that cause this to be an extremely

4

arbitrary rule.

5

And in North Carolina there are districts

6

where once you remove the military base where most of

the population will not be voting in that district,

8

there is a shift of even 12 percent in the minority

9

voting age population increasing by 12 percent once you

10
11

JUSTICE BREYER:

The rule I suggested,

12

though there are arbitrary aspects is a better targeted,

13

more administrable -- or equally administrable or not

14

much worse administrable arbitrary rule.

15

MR. BROWNING:

Justice Breyer, in our view

16

the rule that should be applied is consistent with the

17

rule of LULAC, that the minority group is substantially

larger than its coalition partner.
