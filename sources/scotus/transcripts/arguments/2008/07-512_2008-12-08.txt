CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

v. LinkLine Communications.

Mr. Panner.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON PANNER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. PANNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit's

12

decision because it asserts that this Court's holding in

13

Trinko and principles regarding unilateral pricing

14

decisions as explained in Brooke and elsewhere.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You are probably

16

feeling pretty good about your chances since your

17

opponent has given up, right?

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. PANNER:

Well, Your Honor, it is correct

20

that this Court observed in Roberts that the

21

Respondents' agreement that the legal position of the

22

court below is incorrect, certainly should provide this

23

Court great comfort in reversing the decision in the

24

Ninth Circuit.

25

here is important because the Ninth Circuit's decision

And, indeed, a decision on the merits

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is harmful to consumers, deterring beneficial price cuts

2

and sufficient particle integration.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Any question should

4

we have about the Article III status of this aspect of

5

the dispute?

6

MR. PANNER:

No, Your Honor.

The parties'

7

agreement on a point of law does not deprive this Court

8

of jurisdiction in any way, and the parties remain

9

adverse in this case.

The Respondents continue to

10

pursue a section 2 claim, and the same intend to -

11

evidently intend to pursue the same relief.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you might be

13

right, but, you know, with respect to standing we have

14

held that that is an issue-by-issue inquiry, not a live

15

case broadly conceived.

16

MR. PANNER:

Well, in Laidlaw the Court said

17

that it was for a particular type of relief, that the

18

plaintiff had to establish standing, but that's not at

19

issue here.

20

section 2 claim and pursue, evidently, the same type of

21

relief based on the same course of conduct.

22

The Respondents continue to pursue a

I would also like to point out that

23

Respondents, while conceding that the position of the

24

Ninth Circuit was incorrect, have not clearly stated

25

that they would not take advantage of a decision by this
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court affirming the Ninth Circuit.

And I think that

2

that's important, because there really would be no

3

reason for these Respondents to say that if for whatever

4

reason the Court decided that the Ninth Circuit is

5

right, that they would not go ahead and take advantage

6

--

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

have the Ninth Circuit decision vacated.

9

ask us to affirm it.

10
11

I thought they asked to
They didn't

They said vacate that decision is

wrong.
MR. PANNER:

That is right,

12

Justice Ginsburg, but the point is that if this Court

13

were to disagree -- for example, it is well established

14

that the Solicitor General's confession of error, for

15

example, or a State attorney general's confession of

16

error does not bind this Court.

17

position with respect to the proper disposition of the

18

case never binds the Court.

19

Indeed, a party's

So the Court certainly has the power to say,

20

now that the case is properly before it:

21

the Ninth Circuit got it right.

22

We think that

Obviously, we don't think that that's what

23

we think the Court should say; but, given that

24

circumstance, if the Court, for whatever reason, were to

25

affirm the Ninth Circuit, there would be nothing that
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would bar the Respondents from taking advantage of that.

2

Even though they said that that was a legal error, if

3

that were the established law, there would be no reason

4

for them not to pursue it.

5

And I think that that's relevant, again, to

6

the question whether the parties remain adverse for

7

Article III purposes.

8

adversity of the parties with respect, even to the

9

section 2 claim, even if intended to pursue it

10

As a jurisdictional issue, the

differently, the theory is sufficient.

11

But the point I am making is simply to

12

illustrate that adversity even with respect to the

13

narrow legal issue remains, even though they are not

14

contesting the proper -- contesting the proper

15

disposition of that legal issue.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When this comes up, we

17

usually, if a -- if a party abandons a position in

18

support of a decision, the court of appeals decision, we

19

have appointed -- as you noted in your brief, we have

20

appointed a friend of the court to represent the

21

position of the circuit.

22

And here we don't have that.

We don't have

23

anyone that we have appointed and say you presented the

24

position.

25

You defend the position below.
MR. PANNER:

Well, that's true, Your Honor,
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

but there is an amicus arguing before the Court today

2

defending the Ninth Circuit's decision.

3

two amicus briefs filed on that.

4

filed, the Court could have sought additional help.

5

the positions -- the arguments in favor of the Ninth

6

Circuit decision had been put forward in the amicus

7

brief, and there will be argument in support of the

8

Ninth Circuit's decision today.

9

And there were

Had those not been
But

And I think -- I think that the

10

jurisdictional issue is answered by your question.

11

is to say, the fact that the Court could appoint amicus

12

shows that this Court retains Article III jurisdiction.

13

And it's very important in this case for the Court to

14

reach the merits of the decision and clearly to rule

15

that there is no independent price-squeeze theory under

16

Section 2 because recognition of such a theory, as in

17

the Ninth Circuit's, decision is very -- very harmful to

18

consumers.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That

Is there any way in

20

which the resolution of their price-squeeze claim would

21

affect their Brooke Group Section 2 claim?

22

MR. PANNER:

I think it could, Your Honor.

23

In their brief they refer to the possibility that the

24

wholesale price that was charged could be in some way a

25

proxy for costs.

And this Court clearly stated that
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there's a different issue as to whether a single

2

economic unit is charging prices below cost; that the

3

wholesale prices that may be charged are not an

4

appropriate proxy.

5

But I -- so, in that respect, I think that a

6

clear declaration with respect to what is required -- I

7

guess the distinction between the predatory-pricing

8

theory of liability and a price-squeeze claim as

9

recognized by the Ninth Circuit could have an impact.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I just clarify:

Are

11

you arguing there is never a price-squeeze claim under

12

Section 2?

13

Hand's reasoning in the Alcoa case?

14

MR. PANNER:

In other words, are you challenging Judge

Well, Your Honor, I believe, I

15

am challenging Judge Hand's reasoning in Alcoa.

16

that I would not go so far as to say that there would

17

never be a situation in which a price squeeze, that is,

18

an insufficient margin between wholesale and retail

19

prices to allow a competitor to compete -- that that

20

course of conduct could never support a claim under

21

Section 2.

22

I think

But the basis for the claim would have to be

23

that there was a -- a duty to deal -- or a duty to deal

24

under Section 2, an antitrust duty to deal that was

25

effectively being debased through that sort of pricing
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

conduct.

2
3

But JUSTICE STEVENS:

Was there such a duty in

the Alcoa case?

4

MR. PANNER:

Well, I think that the Alcoa

5

case was wrongly decided, Your Honor, in several

6

respects.

7

about Alcoa is that the conduct that was at issue was

8

said to be unlawful because it was an abuse of the power

9

in the ingot market and not monopolization of the

10
11

The critical point about -- the first point

downstream market in sheet.
And so what Judge Hand said was that that

12

was unlawful.

13

it was appropriate to treat it as an independent basis

14

for -- or an independent wrong under section 2.

15

But he expressed some doubt as to whether

But the notion that the abuse -- that

16

charging too high a price at the wholesale level could

17

be an independent section 2 wrong is quite inconsistent

18

with what this Court said in -- in -- most recently in

19

Trinko where it recognize -

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

So there is regulation

21

involved there.

I mean, suppose you had no regulation

22

at all involved.

23

the primary stage, say, ingot, and what that monopolist

24

wants to do is to extend its power into the secondary

25

stage, say, fabrication, in order to make it less likely

Why couldn't you have a monopolist at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that there would be a new entries to attack its primary

2

monopoly?

3

circumstances?

4

have them, wouldn't that set forth a Section 2

5

violation?

6

That would -- suppose you have those
Perhaps they would be rare, but if you

MR. PANNER:

It -- it -- it wouldn't, Your

7

Honor, for the following reason:

That I think it is -

8

it is true that the -- the key point of the -- the basis

9

upon which the question -- the question presented has

10

been granted and upon which the analysis has to turn is

11

that there is no duty to deal at all at the wholesale

12

level.

13

So that the ingot monopolist has no

14

obligation to provide an ingot to a downstream rival.

15

And that judgment is a judgment that it is not worth

16

protecting downstream dependent competitors in order to

17

promote the competitive process.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, that may be the

19

assumption on this case, but that may not be the

20

assumption on the next case.

21

arguing that you wanted us to hold that at -- well, you

22

wanted us to hold whether we are dealing with a

23

regulatory case or in Justice Breyer's example, where

24

there is -- where there is no independent regulation,

25

that the greater includes the lesser; that A, there is

And I understood you to be

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

no duty to deal and therefore there is no obligation

2

that can be violated under the antitrust laws by a price

3

squeeze that does not rise to the level of predatory

4

pricing.

5

Is that your position?

6

MR. PANNER:

7

be clear about the relationship.

8
9
10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, the best way to do

that is to start with a yes or no answer.

That way, so

I know where you are going.

11
12

Well, Justice Souter, trying to

MR. PANNER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

And I

think that's not precisely our position.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

MR. PANNER:

Okay.

Our position is that in the

15

absence of a duty to deal, one does not look at an

16

allegation of insufficient margin as a potential section

17

2 -

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

But what I think we

19

are trying to get at is, should we foresee a situation,

20

with or without the regulatory participation of

21

something like the agency here, in which there would be

22

a duty to deal, which would support a price squeeze

23

theory that did not amount to predatory pricing?

24
25

MR. PANNER:

Your Honor, I don't think that

the Court has to anticipate that.

I think what the

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court should say is that there are narrow circumstances

2

as recognized in Trinko, where there may be a duty to

3

deal under section 2.

4

may be conduct that constitutes a refusal to deal, even

5

a constructive refusal to deal.

6

give a simple example, if a widget, if the downstream

7

product costs $10 and a widget is made available for a

8

million dollars, that is not really dealing at all.

9

And in that circumstance there

There is really -- to

But the point is that the section -- the

10

price squeeze piece of the allegation really does not

11

add to the underlying question of what is the section 2

12

duty that needs to be enforced.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's it -- I mean,

14

now maybe you can get me off what I am thinking, but now

15

it sounds that the answer to Justice Stevens's question

16

is yes.

17

opinion in Alcoa.

18

circumstances, whether true of Alcoa or not, where that

19

did make out the claim, namely, the one I suggested.

Now, I have, yes, overruled Judge Hand's
I always thought there were

20

Well, it's quite a different battle if, in

21

fact, the person whose injured, namely, the fabricator

22

who is complaining, has a place to go, such as the FCC

23

or the Alcoa regulatory agency, because under those

24

circumstances, he has a place to complain that these

25

prices are out of line.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But if there is no place to go, well, I'm

2

suddenly -- I'm a little hesitant to overturn Alcoa

3

under those circumstances, and the reason the duty to

4

deal doesn't deal with it is we could come into an

5

existing world where duty or no duty, there have been

6

independent fabricators who for a long time have bought

7

their ingot from this monopolist.

8
9

MR. PANNER:
that is two-fold.

Well, Your Honor, the answer to

First of all, because there is no

10

duty to deal, by assumption the producer of ingot, the

11

alleged wholesale monopolist, has the privilege to

12

withdraw the supply of that.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then I would say that

14

shouldn't be the law.

15

law is because that ingot may, by either withdrawing or,

16

in fact, raising his price way above a competitive level

17

and charging just no room to remain in business, is

18

trying to drive out possible new entrants into the ingot

19

stage of the business.

20

one out there as possibilities to break down the

21

monopolist in ingot.

22

The reason it shouldn't be the

And the fabricators are a number

And if that is the motive, as shown by the

23

behavior, there should be a section 2 claim.

24

want to argue that straight on the merits, what's the

25

answer to that argument?
14
Alderson Reporting Company

If you

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PANNER:

The answer to that argument,

2

Your Honor, is the one that Trinko offers, is that it's

3

very important in establishing the antitrust rules to

4

recognize the incentive that those rules will create for

5

investment and for innovation.

6

If the monopolist is forced to share the

7

benefit of the monopoly with downstream rivals on the

8

basis there is potential entry, that is going to be a

9

significant disincentive to innovation at the upstream

10

level.

11

recognize that in the general run of cases there is not

12

going to be harm and recognizes that the very scrutiny

13

of that conduct will deter beneficial conduct and

14

beneficial innovation and beneficial investment by the

15

upstream monopolist, that recognition is the one that

16

argues in favor of saying, in the absence of a duty to

17

deal, where -- where the wholesale input could be

18

withdraw from the market and where, therefore, the

19

incremental harm from a price squeeze is really quite

20

hard to identify.

21

inappropriate to recognize any sort of a duty under

22

section 2.

23

And the establishment of clear rules, ones that

But that in that circumstance it is

JUSTICE BREYER:

Just out of curiosity, is

24

there a place where in this case the plaintiffs could

25

go, a place which has a label "regulator" under it?

Yes, there is, Your Honor.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So we needn't reach the

issue in this case?

7

MR. PANNER:

Well, Your Honor, I think that

8

the -- significant regulation is not necessary.

I agree

9

with Your Honor that that is a factor that the Court

10

could allow to be placed somehow on the scale.

11

analysis that took place in Trinko is, first of all,

12

whether there is an antitrust duty there at all and

13

whether to extend it in light of the regulatory scheme

14

that existed.

15

of regulation, there should be no duty under section 2.

16

But the

And so, in this case, even in the absence

JUSTICE SOUTER:

With respect to your

17

argument that there is going to be an upstream

18

disincentive to investment in the monopolist if we do

19

not come up with a clear rule that you want, are we at a

20

stage or is the fashion of economics at a stage where we

21

can say that there is a clear consensus supporting your

22

argument?

23

And if the answer is no, then isn't the only

24

sensible thing for this Court to do to is leave it to

MR. PANNER:

Your Honor, I think there is a

2

consensus in all of the scholar literature that was

3

cited by the American Antitrust Institute, there wasn't

4

anyone who supported, there was no scholar who supported

5

the recognition of a price squeeze claim under section

6

2.

I do think that -

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

8

in effect, the investment disincentive?

9

MR. PANNER:

For the reasons you gave,

Well, I think the scholarly

10

literature that explains the recognition of price

11

squeeze duty would be harmful does indeed rely on the

12

sorts of reasons that -

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is that, in effect,

14

uncontested within the profession except for the

15

margins?

16

MR. PANNER:

I would assume as in any

17

academic discipline, there would be those who are trying

18

to find counterexamples.

19

and one for example Professor Carlton stresses in his

20

article and stressed another scholarly works is that the

21

search for the rare case itself can cause very grave

22

harm in the conduct that is following.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I think the point there

I follow the argument.

3

economic literature makes this a kind of slam dunk

4

decision, then it seems for me the only thing for a

5

Court to do is leave it for reasoning and analysis.

I don't know what's going on out

And unless we reach the point in which the

MR. PANNER:

Well, I think that the Brooke

decision -- and as reaffirmed the answer to that.

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

MR. PANNER:

Is there -

There is a certain kinds of

10

conduct where it is possible to create a model where

11

there would be some negative consequences of the

12

conduct, but that the very search for it risks deterring

13

conduct that is of obvious benefit to the consumers.

14

And that's true here.

15

The recognition of an independent price

16

squeeze duty would deter retail price reductions that

17

are immediately beneficial to consumers, and it deters

18

entry into the downstream market by a vertical -- by a

19

wholesale monopolist who may then encounter a duty to

20

protect downstream rivals; and, of course, it would

21

deter voluntary dealing.

22

And I think that that you know, discussions

23

with my client reflect that this is a real effect, that

24

they are on the margin, the concern about the potential

25

for litigation makes investment and certainly

important point from Trinko that is relevant here is

that -- such a rule would protect only competitors, and

doesn't allege any harm to the competitive process,

And the government is not saying that there

might not be some exclusionary conduct, Justice Breyer,

3

that could someday be alleged, if there was an attempt

5

The government does not mean to foreclose; at

the government's position is a narrow one, which is that

13

duty to deal -- that is, this person who is dealing with

than proof that they can't compete.

That doesn't show any harm to the

18

competitive process, which is what this Court has

repeatedly held is required for liability under section

2, and for good reason.

to your question, the government is not saying that it

is not plausible that there isn't some anticompetitive

That really isn't, as Mr. Panner said, worth

legitimate price cutting, and it puts the courts in the

that the Petitioners' retail prices are below some

appropriate measure of the Petitioners' costs; and what

they want to do is essentially what Alcoa does, which is

19

why it's mistaken, is it attributes -- it would

20

attribute to Petitioners the wholesale price they are

willing to sell their upstream input to others, and what

We think that is -- that is the case, that

that is the incorrect view of the law, and indeed, to

some extent we agree with the Solicitor General that the

existence of a regulatory remedy is not sufficient to

MR. BRUNELL:

No, I do not agree with that.

And, indeed, our brief cites an eminent professor, John

10

Vickers at Oxford, an economist who supports a

traditional Alcoa-type claim, that is a claim based on

12

what we've call the transfer price test, where one looks

at the margin between the retail and wholesale prices

and asks whether that is sufficient to cover the

Would the Court have

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No.

My question was:

Was there a duty to deal under the antitrust laws?

Because it seems to me the only reason that there is a

17

duty to deal is because of the regulation.

18

the regulation in order to establish the duty, but then

19

you don't want to go to the regulators to regulate the

20

price.

So, you use

And it seems to me that that's inconsistent.

21

MR. BRUNELL:

Whether there is a duty to

22

deal can only be answered by asking whether a violation

23

-- a refusal to deal would constitute an antitrust

24

violation.

25

required dealing and, therefore, no dealing whatsoever,

And in this case, had -- had there been no

totally academic.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

that you, therefore, must rely on the regulation to

establish the initial predicate of a duty to deal.

You want us to look at regulation first and antitrust

Why can't we just look at this case as

it's a regulatory problem, go to the regulators.

Would that lie here first?

I mean, you don't -- you don't think -- you don't think

But let me back up for one second.

The -

22

the regulatory regime here is quite different from the

23

one in Trinko.

24

duty that essentially required the monopolist to

25

cooperate with its rivals in the monopoly market in

In -- in Trinko you had a regulatory

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

order to dismantle the monopoly.

2

In this case you have a regulation that is

3

designed to ensure that the monopolist does not extend

4

its monopoly power into unregulated competitive markets.

5

And so the -- surely, the regulators focus -- can focus

6

on the wholesale rates and ensure in this case that the

7

rate that the monopolist charges itself is the same as

8

the rate it charges its rivals with the object of

9

ensuring a competitive downstream market.

10

But that doesn't mean that that should oust

11

antitrust law.

12

it's important to have antitrust law available to

13

enforce claims in order for them to cut back on their

14

regulations.

15

AT&T sought to de-tariff its wholesale offering, the

16

regulators referred to the fact that one of the

17

justifications for de-tariffing would be that the

18

antitrust laws would be available in case there were a

19

problem.

20

The regulators may, in fact, think that

And indeed, in this case, when the -- when

So the -- the relationship between antitrust

21

and regulation is symbiotic and complementary.

22

would suggest that in this case the mere fact that the

24

insufficient cooperation by the Petitioner in this case

25

did not state a claim for refusal to deal shouldn't

preclude a -- a price-squeeze claim any more than it

2

should preclude a predatory pricing claim, which the

3

government and the Petitioners seem to concede would

4

still lie.

5

Now, finally, this point about an

6

over-deterrence and whether there is any evidence that

7

any monopolist at any time has ever been deterred from

8

engaging in legitimate retail price-cutting or efficient

9

vertical integration, I would submit that there is

10

absolutely no evidence anywhere in the literature, no

11

empirical evidence, that there is a problem of over

12

deterrence.

13

And had there been a problem over the last

14

63 years that Alcoa has existed, one would think it

15

wouldn't be too hard to find evidence of that.

16

no evidence.

17

There is

Furthermore, in Brooke Group the Court did

18

not simply rely on the risk of over-deterrence as a

19

basis for holding that above-cost price-cutting was not

20

actionable.

21

The fact -- the fear that making above-cost

22

price-cutting illegal would deter legitimate

23

price-cutting, but also the fact that above-cost

24

price-cutting would not eliminate equally efficient

25

rivals.

In Brooke Group it relied on two factors:

Any equally efficient rival could meet an

MR. BRUNELL:

The notion that they would

retail price, rather than lowering their wholesale

14

price, I would submit is certainly as belied by the

15

facts of the Alcoa case which in the district court

16

reflect that when the government started looking into

17

the price squeeze and the price squeeze was ended, it

18

was ended voluntarily by Alcoa lowering its wholesale

price, not raising its retail price.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AARON PANNER

MR. PANNER:

I have two points I would like

to make.

2

Justice Breyer and Justice Kennedy, and others, I do

3

think that the presence of a regulatory remedy here is a

4

critical factor arguing in favor of reversal of the

5

Ninth Circuit's decision.

6

First of all, I think, in agreement with

The second point that I really want to make

7

is the importance of clear rules.

In the antitrust

8

context where we are talking about a system of rules

9

that is going to govern decisionmaking by businesses

10

where most of those decisions are never going to lead to

11

litigation or are never going to come before the courts,

12

it is critically important to have clear rules that

13

avoid deterring beneficial conduct, that avoid having

14

the rules themselves harm consumers.

15

I think that was the point that

16

Justice Alito and Justice Ginsburg were getting at in

17

the questioning.

18

the merits explaining why the Ninth Circuit's price

19

squeeze decision -- not just here, but in the prior

20

decision, in City of Anaheim -- is incorrect and

21

inconsistent with this Court's precedents.

22

It is critical to adopt a decision on

And, more broadly, it is critical to have a

23

clear rule stating that in the absence of a duty to

24

deal, an allegation of price squeeze, it doesn't stay a

25

claim.
53
Alderson Reporting Company

And I think that it's also -- would be very

2

valuable to say that the complaint that was before the
