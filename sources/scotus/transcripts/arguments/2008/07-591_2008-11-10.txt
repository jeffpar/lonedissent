CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in Case 07-591, Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts.
Mr. Fisher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Crawford v. Washington, this Court made

11

clear that the right to confrontation, at its core, is a

12

protection against a system of trial by affidavit.

13

is an ancient procedural guarantee that requires the

14

prosecution to prove its case through live witnesses who

15

testify before the jury and who are subject to

16

cross-examination.

17

It

Introducing forensic laboratory reports,

18

such as the certificates at issue in this case, is the

19

modern equivalent of trial by affidavit.

20

are sworn formal statements.

21

purposefully for the express purpose of proving a fact

22

that is an element of a criminal offense, and, as the

23

State forthrightly admits in its brief, they are

24

introduced in lieu of having the analyst called as a

25

witness to the stand.

The documents

They are crafted

That's right.

So if you had

Our position -

10

our position is that whoever the Commonwealth wants to

use to prove the fact that they are trying to prove is

it would be the analyst.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In this case,

But -- but you would ask -

15

if a supervisor did it, what would you ask the

16

supervisor?

17

this?

18

is what the analysis showed?

19

no, it was one of my subordinates who did it, but I can

20

tell you he was a very reliable person.

21

Can you testify to your own knowledge that this

MR. FISHER:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

about.

14

MR. FISHER:

But even in a test where the

15

analyst doesn't remember and, as you put it, it's a

standardized test, there are still plenty of questions

17

the defendant might want to ask, such as what test was

19

Alderson Reporting Company

performed."

2

It's there on the document.
MR. FISHER:

Well, I think that's a choice

3

that defense counsel could make, as the defense counsel

4

always has a choice in a criminal case to decide whether

5

to press the prosecution's evidence or to simply stay

6

silent and then later argue at closing the prosecution

7

hasn't given you enough to prove the case.

8
9

But to the extent the Commonwealth is taking
the position that cross-examining would be fruitless in

10

a situation like this, the very basis of this Court's

11

Crawford decision is that's not for courts to decide.

12

It is up to the defense counsel to -- if he wishes, to

13

insist on live testimony that he can cross-examine and

14

then -

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, then why -- why

16

isn't it an adequate substitute to say that, if the

17

defendant wants this testimony, the defendant can call

18

the analyst and cross-examine the analyst as an adverse

19

witness?

20

MR. FISHER:

Well, three reasons, Justice

21

Ginsburg:

First, if that were correct, then I don't see

22

anything that would stop the prosecution in every

23

criminal case simply from putting a pile of affidavits

24

on a judge's desk and saying it's up to the defense to

25

call whatever witnesses he wants and cross-examine them.

But even as a matter of text and structure

2

of the Constitution, as a textual matter, the right to

confrontation is a passive right in the defendant's

4

hands.

5

confrontation, and that's bolstered structurally by the

6

Compulsory Process Clause.

7

Process Clause gives the defendant the very right that

8

you just explained, that the defendant can subpoena

9

witnesses into court and ask them questions.

It requires the prosecution to arrange for the

Remember, the Compulsory

And surely

10

the Confrontation Clause adds something on top of that.

11

And I think this Court's decision in Taylor

12

against Illinois is the best explanation of the

13

difference between the two clauses.

14

that the Confrontation Clause arises simply by the

15

nature of adversary proceedings, and it's a -- it's a

16

rule that governs the way the prosecution must introduce

17

its case.

18

requirement that the prosecution put its live witnesses

on the stand for the jury to observe them.

of course, has the decision whether to cross-examine

those witnesses, or if witnesses are not called by the

prosecution that he would wish to be part of the case,

he can subpoena them.

witnesses like this.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you would say that

2

what they call the notice-and-demand type statute, that

3

that's all right?

4

MR. FISHER:

There is a variety of

5

notice-and-demand type statutes, Justice Ginsburg, and I

6

think the law professors' brief lays it out the best of

7

what we have before you.

8

General that a plain notice-and-demand statute that

9

requires the defense to do nothing more than assert his

10

right in advance of trial to have the prosecution put a

11

live witness on the stand would be constitutional, I

12

think, under this Court's jurisprudence.

13

Compulsory Process Clause, under the jury right, there

14

are plenty of constitutional rights that, with fair

15

notice, a Defendant can be required to assert in advance

16

of trial.

17

We agree with the Solicitor

Under the

Now, there are other types of statutes that

18

other States call "notice and demand" that require

19

something more of the defendant, whether it be that the

20

defendant himself call the witness, whether it be the

21

defendant himself make some kind of good faith or prima

22

facie showing in order to have the prosecution call the

23

witness.

24

to the extent in this opinion it would mention

25

notice-and-demand statutes, it would want to be careful

Those types of statutes, I think this Court,

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to leave for another day, because, again, we would agree

2

with the Solicitor General that those would raise more

3

difficult constitutional questions.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In your answer, you said,

5

well, there would be this stack of affidavits and that's

6

all the State would have to do.

7

that was not quite responsive because the question here

8

is whether or not there is an exception for business

9

records.

Nobody is talking about affidavits, witnesses,

10

and so forth.

11

done in the ordinary course.

12

I think, Mr. Fisher,

We are talking about business records

It's true that it -- that the core principle

13

is whether that confrontation is required, but the

14

question is whether or not business records should be

15

treated as something that are not testimony because they

16

are done based on other protocols with other procedures

17

where there is substantial insulation from the facts of

18

the particular case because it's a routine scientific

19

exercise.

20

So I think your answer, I would agree, is

21

responsive based on your theory of the case, but as a

22

matter of practice and as a matter of the issue that's

23

before the Court, I don't think it addresses it.

24

MR. FISHER:

Okay.

Thank you.

25

I -- I took Justice Ginsburg's question to
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

be asking whether giving the defendant the right to

2

subpoena the witness would be adequate under the

3

Confrontation Clause if these documents were

4

testimonial.

5

Now, your question is whether they might not

6

be testimonial at all viewed through the lens of whether

7

they are a business record.

8

So, as a historical matter, I think it's

9

plain that no documents prepared in contemplation of

10

litigation were ever considered to be business records.

11

And this Court's decision in Palmer v. Hoffman in 1943 I

12

think lays that out very, very clearly.

13

So there is no historical argument that

14

business records would fit -- would be exempted from the

15

testimonial rule as a class.

16

said in Crawford v. Washington that even if a State

17

under a modern hearsay exception, whether it be a

18

business-record rule or in the State of Massachusetts's

19

case a special, brand-new hearsay rule -- just because

20

that might be okay in the run-of-the-mill cases doesn't

21

exempt it from the right to confrontation.

characterized, with all due respect, as an argument for

2

its reliability.

3

juries think that certain scientific processes yield

4

more reliable results in terms of reports and testimony

5

and assertions.

6

decision in Crawford says quite strongly -- that a judge

7

cannot decide just on the basis of reliability to exempt

8

a given record or a class of records from the

9

Confrontation Clause.

10

And it may well be that judges and

But we think, again -- and this Court's

And I think, Justice Kennedy, another

11

analogy that makes it even more clear is police reports.

12

Police reports, just like the lab report in this case,

13

are -- are sworn documents created by public servants

14

who are sworn to tell the truth, sworn to find evidence

15

whether it exonerates, whether it incriminates, and to

16

write up a report.

17

suggested that police reports describing a crime scene

18

-- for example, no matter how objective the facts

19

relayed, such as there is a blood stain on the carpet,

20

there is -- the door was wide open when I got there -

21

those kinds of assertions would be exempted from the

22

Confrontation Clause.

And I don't think anyone has ever

23

It may well be that they are likely to be

24

correct, that they are assertions of fact that can be

25

verified, but we've never understood that to fall

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

outside of the ambit of the Confrontation Clause.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But if you had what we can

3

call an independent lab, that certainly-- you certainly

4

can distinguish that from a police report.

5

line-drawing question, I'll admit, but I think it's

6

easily distinguished.

7

MR. FISHER:

It's a

Well, I think if you had -- in

8

contrast to this case, if you had a laboratory that was

9

a private lab being used by the police, that would raise

10

the question whether police agents who are private

11

individuals but -- but asked by the police to create

12

something like this, would generate testimonial evidence

13

just as well.

14

And I think the answer would be yes.

In fact, in Davis this Court already

15

addressed the situation, although it reserved in the

16

footnote, but it assumed that the 911 operator in that

17

case, who was a private individual working for a private

18

company hired by the -- by the police -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Fisher, how many States

20

do things the way -- the way you would have them done?

21

I mean, how many States don't have these -- these notice

22

laws, but in fact bring in the analyst to -- to give the

23

information?

24
25

MR. FISHER:

Well, let me give you a few

categories, Justice Scalia.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

There are six States, it is our

2

understanding, including big populous States like

3

California, Illinois and Georgia, that have no special

4

hearsay law whatsoever, that bring in witnesses if

5

defendants demand it.

6

There is another category of States -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

Well, they bring in

witnesses if -- if defendants demand, but -

9

MR. FISHER:

I'm sorry, I misspoke.

I

10

misspoke.

That in the ordinary course need to bring in

11

witnesses.

Now, that was --getting ahead to my next -

12

my next category, there are at least nine or ten other

13

States that have the kind of bland notice-and-demand

14

regime that I was discussing with Justice Ginsburg.

15

so that's another category.

16

And

And then you have -- since Crawford there is

17

another, I believe, five additional States where their

18

State supreme courts have held that Crawford applies to

19

lab reports like this.

20

of years they have been doing it the way that we would

21

urge.

22

So at least for the past couple

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I wonder -- and correct me

23

if I'm wrong -- if you -- if you didn't state your case

24

strongly enough with reference to California.

2

MR. FISHER:

They might, Justice Breyer, and

3

I'd -- I'd be willing to assume for purposes of argument

4

that they would.

5

offered by the prosecution in a criminal case, the fact

6

that they were a business record would not answer the

7

confrontation question as to whether -

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

wouldn't.

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

you have nothing else you want to say on this point.

13

It's the same as Justice Kennedy raised.

14

MR. FISHER:

I think I do, Justice -

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

It seems like there are

16

some things going one way, and some things going the

17

other on the issue of whether to call it "testimonial."

18

MR. FISHER:

But I do want to -- with all

19

respect, I did want to add something to what you said

20

about the rigors of the lab or of science.

21

be that those add to the truth, the reliability of

22

reports.

It may well

Let me say two things about that.
First of all, the Confrontation Clause

It's, again, for the defendant to

You are absolutely right.

11

MR. FISHER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what -- what I'm trying

to work out in my mind is not necessarily what happened

in the year 1084.

15

your views on what's a workable rule.

16

across the country on this, it seems most States have

17

worked with a rule that has allowed the defendant to

MR. FISHER:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think But if I assume -- I'm

5

really uncertain as to whether it has covered

in ancient history.

MR. FISHER:

10

I understand.

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, is there

11

anything else you want to add to me on those

12

assumptions?

13

MR. FISHER:

Yes, that -- that, again, it is

14

-- it is not for the court; it's for the defendant to

15

decide.

16

generally speaking ought to be that when a document is

17

prepared in contemplation of prosecution, or more

18

specifically in this case to prove a fact that is an

19

element of a criminal case, because that's what these

20

reports say, then they should fall under the

21

Confrontation Clause.

22

We think the definition of "testimonial"

And to the extent that these are in some

recite the testing, and recite the damning evidence.

MR. FISHER:

No, I would very much resist

that it will always be an empty exercise.
JUSTICE ALITO:

No.

But in -- in the

12

instance where the defendant doesn't think it would be

13

worthwhile to subpoena the -- the recordkeeper, the

14

person who performed the test, but simply wants to put

15

the prosecution through the effort of getting the person

16

there to testify, it's -- what is achieved?

17

MR. FISHER:

Well, as I said, I think that

18

through notice-and-demand regimes and stipulations,

19

often that is not going to happen.

20

achieved, what is achieved is the same thing that is

21

achieved in any criminal trial where a defendant insists

periodically that the prosecution be put to its proof.

point.

So that - all right, go back to the plea

2

bargaining, which is your first thing, which makes me a

3

little nervous for the reason that I see this bargaining

4

system as a system where the prosecutor makes a charge,

5

the prosecutor controls the sentence, then the defense

6

bar would like to have an added weapon, and this added

7

weapon is if you actually go to trial, I'm going to

8

insist that you call these people.

9

where they are.

You don't even know

I'm not going to accept the lab report.

10

And then maybe the prosecutor will lower the requirement

11

or maybe the prosecutor raised it in the first place

12

because he thought you would say something like that.

13

So I'm not -- is there anything you can say

about how this works in the presence of plea bargaining?

Do we know any -- do we have any information on that?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Fisher, I am interested

6

in the history since that's what the Court held in

7

Crawford, that the content of the Confrontation Clause

8

is not what we would like it to be, but what it

9

historically was when it was enshrined in the

10

Constitution.

As a matter of history, was there a

11

business records exception, not from the hearsay rule

12

but from the Confrontation Clause?

13

MR. FISHER:

Not that I'm aware of.

The

14

best -- the best source that I believe exists is the

15

Wigmore treatise, which both sides have cited.

16

there was a shop-book rule that allowed shop-book

17

ledgers and entries at the common law.

18

no -- there's no suggestion that that was -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It says

But there is

Why isn't that a business

I don't -

MR. FISHER:

It is a business records

22

exception, but it's not an exception to the right to

confrontation because no one would have considered

24

ordinary business records created without contemplation

of litigation to be -- to be testimonial evidence.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

laboratory reports on DNA, blood tests, all sorts of

2

evidence?

3

Isn't that correct?
MR. FISHER:

That's right, Justice Stevens.

4

And you can you look at the Massachusetts own decisions.

5

The State courts in Massachusetts already extended their

6

rule in their day to ballistics tests, for example,

7

which are notoriously unreliable in terms of empirical

8

studies that have been -- that have been conducted about

9

them.

And my understanding -- I think you're right -

10

is that nothing in the Commonwealth's rule distinguishes

11

one kind of forensic report from another.

12

The United States is offering a slightly

13

different analysis that appears to ask, to some degree,

14

the degree of interpretation involved in a given

15

forensic laboratory report.

17

extent interpretation would be required, this is clearly

18

on the interpretive side of the ledger.

20

source for that, the Scientific Evidence treatise by

21

Giannelli and Imwinkelried that the both parties cite at

section 23.030(c) lays out the mass spectrometry way of

23

testing for drugs that the Commonwealth tells you was

the test used in this case and describes in great detail

question that a supervisor wouldn't be an adequate

substitute for the analyst.

22

We are very busy in this place; could we schedule a

23

deposition; we'll present the analyst at a time mutually

24

agreeable to both sides, rather than have the analyst on

25

the hook to show up on a trial date?

But suppose the lab says:

That would work to preserve the

evidence in case the analyst became unavailable at the

wasn't there on the day of trial?

it would substitute for live testimony.

But let me say one other way that this

problem can be addressed by States is that they could

11

have a supervisor take the stand and rely on raw data -

12

on raw data and give his or her explanation of raw data.

13

It's just that the person cannot take the stand and

relay somebody else's conclusion to the jury.

MS. COAKLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The drug analysis certificates at issue in
this case are not testimonial statements that have been

covered by the Confrontation Clause.

2

not the statement of a percipient witness who has

observed past behavior of the defendant.

4

That is, they are

Indeed, what they are are official records

5

of objective identified -- it's independently verifiable

6

facts that are -- that were admissible at common law.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What is your answer to

8

Mr. Fisher's argument that if that proposition of yours

9

is -- is -- is, in fact, sound in response to this case,

10

the State can put in its entire case by -- in a

11

circumstantial evidence case, by way of affidavit and,

12

in effect, satisfy the Confrontation Clause by saying,

13

well, you can call the witness as part of the defense

14

case and cross-examine there?

15

MS. COAKLEY:

Because clearly, the kinds of

16

affidavits that are the subject of Confrontation Clause

17

analysis could not be submitted by that.

18

is an exception to that.

It's really a report of a scientist

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, what about the -- the

5

blue car going down the street statement?

In a

6

circumstantial evidence case the witness comes in and

7

says yes, I saw a blue car go down the street at 10

8

o'clock.

Is that testimonial?

9

MS. COAKLEY:

10

It is, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And the distinction between

11

that and the lab report saying the substance that was

12

shown to me which I analyzed was cocaine, what's the -

13

what's the distinction?

14

MS. COAKLEY:

In the first instance you have

15

a witness to an event in a particular case that can be

16

tied to, perhaps, behavior of the defendant that's

17

deemed to be criminal.

18

subject to confrontation, if it's, you know, is going to

19

be used by the prosecution.

20

It's -- it's classic hearsay and

In this instance, though, we have a protocol

21

set up by a State statute that indeed does test

22

substances other than those definitely headed for

23

litigation.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:
between the two.

I don't see the difference

I mean, the one, he saw the blue car
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

going down the street, which through other evidence can

2

be connected to the defendant; and here the witness says

3

this is cocaine, which through other evidence is going

4

to be connected to the defendant.

5

that -- that connected fact is deemed essential by the

6

prosecution for the conviction.

7

difference between the two.

8
9

MS. COAKLEY:

And in both cases

I don't see the

Well, I think there are

several differences, Your Honor, but one of which is

10

that it is identifiable and it can be verified outside

11

of what the scope of the Confrontation Clause is.

statement.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why does that make a

20

difference?

In other words, the -- Justice Scalia said

21

a moment ago, you know, the -- the statement about the

22

blue car is -- is tied in in the hypothetical case by

23

another witness who said yes, at -- at 10:01 when I

24

heard the gun go off there was a blue car there.

25

this case the cocaine is tied in by saying, yes, the
31
Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cocaine which I delivered to X, about which he has

2

testified, is cocaine that I took out of the pocket of

3

the defendant.

4

There is -- there is a temporal and physical

5

path worked out in both cases.

And it seems to me your

6

attempt to distinguish them is to say well, the temporal

7

path can be extended by one more step in the cocaine

8

case because you can take the cocaine or take something

9

from the cocaine sample and let the defense expert

10

testify to it; which of course is true, but I don't see

11

what that has got to do with the Confrontation Clause or

12

the definition of testimonial evidence.

13

MS. COAKLEY:

I -- I think that that's

14

significant, Your Honor, because it can be tested and

15

verified and isn't dependent upon a cross examination at

16

trial.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But aren't you really

18

saying that the confrontation right is therefore not so

19

important because you have a greater opportunity in the

20

cocaine case of coming up with -- with rebutting

21

evidence, if indeed rebutting evidence can be found.

22

In other words, if -- if -- if the State's

23

witness is wrong, you've got a better shot at proving

24

him wrong than in the blue car case.

25

your argument, I don't see what it's got to do with 32
Alderson Reporting Company

But if that is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

with the basic confrontation right.

2

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think I go back, Your

3

Honor, to looking at all the kinds of statements that

4

this Court has looked at within the scope of the

5

Confrontation Clause.

6

official record, laboratory report, has never been the

7

subject of this kind of analysis and indeed it's not

8

sufficient.

9

This kind of public record,

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, have we ever had -

10

have we ever had a --

11

record kind of case in -- in which the record was

12

prepared expressly for trial?

13

a kind of lab report, public

MS. COAKLEY:

I think that if you look at

14

Dutton, for instance, and the concurring opinion by

15

Justice Harlan talking about laboratory reports deemed

16

to be whatever the analysis was, a business record, that

17

would have been -

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

not take the majority view.

20

where you get authority for the proposition that the

21

public record prepared for the purpose of litigation

22

would have come in under the, in effect, the founding

23

era -- or would have been outside the founding era

24

definition of testimonial.

25

MS. COAKLEY:

Yes, but Justice Harlan did
I mean you -- I don't know

Except the public record, for

Alderson Reporting Company

instance of a coroner's result -- not the coroner's

2

verdict that involves Marian-type depositions, but the

3

results of a coroner's verdict that says somebody is

dead and this is the cause and manner and means of

5

death -- would have been admissible at the time with -

6

that kind of -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

For the indictment, not -

8

not as -- not as independent evidence in the

9

prosecution.

It would form the basis for the

10

indictment, as I understand what the history is.

11

would not be introduced and -- and -- and shown to the

12

jury as evidence that -- that indeed the cause of death

13

was thus and so.

14

MR. FISHER:

It

But autopsy results -- my

15

understanding, Your Honor, is that autopsy results -

16

again not a coroner's verdict, which -- in the reply

17

brief we believe that counsel has conflated what would

18

be a verdict between the fact of an official record, an

19

autopsy report of the death, manner and means of

20

death -- have been and still admissible.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me -- and tell

22

me if this is not the way you want to argue.

23

to me to make your case you have to say of course this

24

is hearsay; and the question is whether it's

25

testimonial.
34
Alderson Reporting Company

It seems

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. COAKLEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it's not testimonial

3

because these are laboratory protocols, subject to

4

ongoing, objective, repeated standards; that's different

5

from testimony that it was a blue car, which is specific

6

to the case.

7

argument you have to make.

That's the kind of framework of the

8

MS. COAKLEY:

That's -

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that as a result of

10

that it is not testimonial because "testimonial" is a

11

legal term that's subject to interpretation.

12

guess that's the argument you're making and that you

13

have to make.

14
15

MS. COAKLEY:

I -- I

Well, that's correct, Your

Honor.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

MS. COAKLEY:

As I see it.

And I think that that is

18

certainly consistent with the way in which this Court in

19

looking at the series of cases from Crawford since, have

20

looked at what a testimonial statement is.

21

you haven't addressed this kind of statement, and I

22

would argue because it doesn't fall within the principal

23

evil that the Confrontation Clause is designed to

24

prevent.

6

testimonial because it wasn't really directed to trial.

7

This does seem more directed to trial, so then you have

8

to tell us why even if it is, there are some independent

9

guarantees of -- of reliability that means that we

10

should say it's not testimonial as a legal matter.

11

MS. COAKLEY:

Yes.
The -- the 911 call was
It wasn't

Well, I agree, Your Honor.

I

12

think that you cannot pull one of these qualities out

13

and say that because it's prepared in anticipation of

14

trial means that therefore it is testimonial.

15

have been several criteria that this Court has looked

16

at, including -- there are other kinds of analogies to

17

this that are akin to this kind of record.

18

instance, in an assault case, a gun which is the real

19

evidence -- remember the cocaine is the real evidence

20

here -- the Commonwealth would introduce a certificate

saying this is a working gun, and that is in lieu of the

In order to make a comparison -- I

difference.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I'm looking at

13

footnote 10 in your brief on page 30.

And you concede

14

that some interpretation of the machine-generated data

15

ordinarily is required.

16

that there is some leeway and subjective interpretation,

17

and you might have different analysts coming out

18

differently and so you need to get the fellow there and

19

ask him well, how often do you -- how often do one of

20

your fellow analysts disagree with your conclusion?

Now why isn't that a suggestion

21

Or this is subjective; I guess some people

22

read it one way or the other one way; which way do you

23

always read it?

24
25

That kind of stuff.

MS. COAKLEY:

Well, interestingly, Your

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I didn't -- I

what type of interpretation?

MS. COAKLEY:

The interpretation that

because of the way that the machine works, the chemicals

are separated out.

MS. COAKLEY:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MS. COAKLEY:

11

I hesitate to use the word "reliable."

in both areas, and so follow what the history was where

11

I'm not saying that, Your

22

Honor, but I'm saying there are certain evils that the

23

Confrontation Clause is designed to prevent.

24

abuse at the laboratory stage or misconduct by

specifically very good at getting at.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why not?

I know I prefer

4

one thing, the custody.

5

whether indeed this was the particular substance that

6

was taken from the defendant.

7

you have to establish a line of custody.

8

do that without getting in the person who did the test.

9

MS. COAKLEY:

It's very important to know

And to establish that,
And you can't

Well, Your Honor, I agree the

10

chain of custody is crucial and it relates to the

11

careful procedure that a police officer used, who by the

12

way is the confrontation witness that you worry about

13

because the behavior is the buying, selling, possession

14

of drugs.

15

really becomes almost secondary to the case.

16

is was the behavior criminal?

17

the drugs is available for confrontation.

18

then clearly marked so the Commonwealth has to create

19

that chain of custody for the court, and indeed if the

20

defendant, who is in the best position to think that

21

perhaps this is involving something other than cocaine

or heroin, has all the opportunities that he needs to

23

make sure that he gets a fair trial.

MS. COAKLEY:

And the -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How do I know that that

8

thing is the one that got to the desk of the analyst who

9

wrote this report?

10

MS. COAKLEY:

I think that whether you

11

brought the analyst in or not, you would have the same

12

establishment of the chain of custody and, indeed, that

13

piece of evidence as to whether it's the same drug

14

relates to the officer in this case testified the

15

16

He could identify it.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It comes back -

So you say you can require

witnesses to show that, right up to the analyst who did

18

the testing, you can require witnesses to testify?

19

the way up to there but not the analyst himself?

20

MS. COAKLEY:

All

I think, Your Honor, that the

21

issue between chain of custody and whether the

22

Confrontation Clause is implicated are different issues

23

--

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but you say that, it

seems to me, because you are -- and I think consistently
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

-- making a distinction between credibility issues and

2

reliability issues.

3

saying the Confrontation Clause is there to test

4

credibility but not reliability.

And I think you are implicitly

5

MS. COAKLEY:

I think -

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The machine is reliable;

7

therefore, it's outside of confrontation.

8

understand the validity of this distinction that is

9

implicit in your answers.

10

MS. COAKLEY:

And I don't

I think perhaps if the Court

11

looks at accuracy rather than reliability and gets

12

outside the realm of the kinds of statements -

14

MS. COAKLEY:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MS. COAKLEY:

Well, accuracy -

-- that we looked at.

But accuracy goes to what this

18

a business records exception or a public records

19

exception.

20

because we believe them to be accurate, and more

21

importantly in this case -

22

The reason they are admissible is precisely

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

No.

They are

23

admissible in criminal cases as far as the Confrontation

24

Clause is concerned because they are not testimonial.

25

MS. COAKLEY:

And they are related, however,
43

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

comment on the argument that the State of California -

10

to get along all right under the rule that the

Petitioner proposes.

12

MS. COAKLEY:

I did join the amicus brief,

13

Your Honor.

14

early to tell because I, certainly from my own

experience, know that the number of cases that go to

involved, and I know that in Massachusetts it would -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the State of California

number of years been able to function quite effectively

under the rule that the Petitioner proposes, it seems to

22

me that's something that you have to address.

23

MS. COAKLEY:

And I address that, Your

undue burden with very little benefit to the defendant.

misdemeanor drug prosecutions would essentially grind to

a halt, and the value to the defendant -- and this Court

has looked at in Inadi and in other situations where

there does not seem to be the real issue involved with

make friends and influence people among judges by

insisting upon testimony in criminal cases where it is

12

obviously not needed.

13

MS. COAKLEY:

Well, two points, Your Honor:

14

In Massachusetts, we do have a circuit court and a

15

superior court so judges move around.

16

thing is that -- my experience is that defendants,

17

whether appointed or otherwise, are extremely vigorous

18

in protecting their rights, and if I were defense

counsel and I had a strategic advantage, I would insist

on it.

The Confrontation Clause is not implicated

when a human being merely authenticates for trial the

person who seems to be testifying:

is an accurate report.

10

MS. SCHERTLER:

But here what speaks is

I certify that this

If I could draw an analogy,

11

Justice Ginsburg, to a historical example that we think

12

illustrates our point, historically records custodians

13

-- public records custodians have been permitted to

14

certify through, when they have express authority at the

15

common law, and -- and into present day that they did a

16

records search, that they found a document within the

17

public records of an agency, and that the document that

18

they are attaching is a true copy of what they found.

19

Those are statements by humans that really

20

set forth the conditions for -- under which the evidence

21

is being presented to the jury.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

MS. SCHERTLER:

24
25

But But those have always been

accepted.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not material prepared

Alderson Reporting Company

for trial.

2

precisely in order to prosecute an individual.

3

It's not material that was generated

MS. SCHERTLER:

The underlying material in

4

the public records case is not testimonial because it

5

was not prepared for trial.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MS. SCHERTLER:

Exactly.
In this case, Justice

8

Scalia, we would submit that the underlying material is

9

also not testimonial, albeit for a separate reason; and

10

that is that it is an instrument-generated result and

11

therefore not the statement of a witness.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let's, let's assume that

13

it's critical to a particular murder prosecution what

14

time the shot was fired, okay?

15

if -- if somebody says I heard the clock strike 12 at

16

the time the shot was fired, that would not be

testimony?

Yes, the clock is a machine, right?

MS. SCHERTLER:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20
21

And you mean to tell me

No.
He is just reciting what

the clock said.
MS. SCHERTLER:

My analogy would be, Justice

22

Scalia, if that clock had in itself a trigger mechanism

23

that would detect when a gunshot was fired; and if that

24

clock delivered, as you have in the cases of a drug

25

analysis, a result, a reading that one could submit into

Alderson Reporting Company

court that says shot detected at 12 p.m., that that

2

nontestimonial evidence could be submitted consistently

with Confrontation Clause principles, but it would still

require authentication.

5

Some person may have to establish that this

clock was set up, it was operating properly, it was

calibrated the way it had to.

8

sorts of foundational facts that are akin to the public

15

call up the -- the keeper and the keeper looks it up,

16

produces it, and has a separate piece of paper or maybe

written beneath it which says:

is why I would bring those two rules together.

20

public records example, what you have is underlying

21

evidence going into the jury that is nontestimonial.

22

that instance, it was because it was a public record not

23

prepared for trial but has always been accepted from -

24

has always been viewed as nontestimonial.

25

Your Honor is correct.
52
Alderson Reporting Company

In the

In this case we

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

don't have that, but what we do have is an underlying

2

evidentiary item that is nontestimonial for a separate

3

purpose, and that is that it is a machine-generated

4

result.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well You're going to work

7

either.

Because the person -- Sir Walter Raleigh's

8

accusers wanted to testify about something that was

9

nontestimonial:

what happened on the day.

So what we

10

are looking for -- I mean, I agree with you that it is a

11

very peculiar result that's going to have every public

12

document in the United States suddenly have the keeper

13

of that document having to come into court.

14

On the other hand, I'm having a hard time

15

figuring out what the distinction is between that and

16

all these other things.

17

MS. SCHERTLER:

Well -- yes, Justice Breyer.

18

Let me just add that in the public records custodian

19

situation, there is always the possibility that the

20

public records custodian who is signing that certificate

21

was careless, is a liar; and those certificates yet have

22

always been viewed as simply foundational vehicles for

getting to the jury nontestimonial evidence.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So just because the

2

machine is involved it seems to me we cannot make a

3

sensible rule based on that.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And there was not a broad

5

exception at common law for public records created in

6

anticipation of criminal litigation.

7

MS. SCHERTLER:

Well, we have -- I mean, we

8

have looked for that limitation in the authorities and

9

we simply have not found it.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Have you found cases where

11

the material was admitted as a public record despite the

12

fact that it was a public record created for

13

prosecution?

14

MR. FISHER:

The difficulty with that,

15

Justice Scalia, is I don't know of equivalent or

16

comparable records that were being created at that time

17

for purposes of litigation.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

These other records, no,

20

you haven't found them.

21

MS. SCHERTLER:

No.

I have -- I have not.

22

Yet, if I could go back to Justice Kennedy's

23

question, there is no record here about how this test in

24

particular was done, but there -- there -- I can tell

25

the Court that actually technology in the controlled

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MS. SCHERTLER:

Murder cases, all

Well, the -- the narrower

8

rule that we are discussing here would be limited to

9

those situations in which the underlying evidence to be

10

presented to the jury is nontestimonial because it is

11

instrument-generated and did not require human analysis.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So is your -- what

13

is your answer to the question I posed to the Attorney

14

General?

15

powder is or is not cocaine.

16

the law says you can admit this with an affidavit?

17

The only issue in the case is whether the

MS. SCHERTLER:

You think you get by if

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice for

18

the following reason.

Just as in the case of the

19

records custodians, a defendant may believe that that is

20

not an authentic record; and nothing about the rule we

21

propose would prevent the defense from challenging the

22

authenticity or the circumstances, the correctness of

23

the testing procedures that were used.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

MS. SCHERTLER:

But you can't -

It's just a question of
56

Alderson Reporting Company

whether -- whether the Confrontation Clause requires

2

that that challenge occur in the Government's case on

3

cross-examination, or as in these record custodian's

cases, if the defense wants to challenge the

5

authenticity of the underlying nontestimonial evidence,

6

he must do so in his case.

15

held that these sorts of certificates of analysis were

required of DEA chemists at the Mid-Atlantic laboratory

18

have increased by 500 percent, from seven to 10

19

appearances per month to routinely over 50 per month,

20

and that the corresponding time that it takes to analyze

substance has increased.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

2

MR. FISHER:

Let me start, Your Honors:

If

3

there is any doubt remaining about the machine-generated

4

theory that the Solicitor General was putting forward

5

today, again I would refer the court back to the

6

scientific evidence treatise.

7

The raw data of a mass spectrometer looks -

8

looks something like a heart monitor.

It's a printout

9

of the squiggly line across the page that a person needs

10

to look at and then analyze as to what it shows about

11

the molecular composite of the substance that the

12

machine was operating.

13

prosecutors in criminal cases want to introduce machine

14

generated data.

15

We have no objection if

They can do that.

But what they can't do is introduce -

16

introduce affidavits certifying as to their -- you know,

17

their interpretation of what a machine did or simply

18

what a machine says, because there is no difference -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you say they could

20

introduce the squiggly line and put on the stand an

21

analyst who says what that squiggly line shows is that

22

this was cocaine?

23
24
25

MR. FISHER:

They could do that, Justice

Scalia.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What's your distinction

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

with the recordkeeper?

2

MR. FISHER:

Pardon me?

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What's your distinction

4

from your own theory of the recordkeeper?

5

recordkeeper all have to -- do they all have to testify

6

to testify that this is indeed the record?

7

MR. FISHER:

Does the

My understanding of the common

8

law on that, as the solicitor general put it, is that

9

that was a foundational requirement that was not

10

necessarily considered evidence.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, there's a

12

hearsay -- there is a hearsay aspect.

13

it's the only thing.

14

there is a hearsay aspect to that which you see, okay.

15

The certificate says this is Joe Jones' birth

16

certificate.

17

outside of court who made that little piece of paper for

18

purposes of this case.

19

it certifies to is directly relevant; indeed, the whole

20

thing falls without it.

21

I'm not saying

There is a chain and so forth but,

That's what the -- now, that's that person

And moreover, the statement that

So, are you going to say the same thing

22

applies, your rule, and you have to call the

23

recordkeeper in or not?

24

not.

25

what the distinction is?

And I think you're going to say

And if you're going to say not, I want to know

rule is consistent.

As a general matter, yes, our

Now, if you look at Wigmore,

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

in -- you're going to -

6

MR. FISHER:

You are going to calling

I'm trying to answer.

What

7

Wigmore says is that something like a public

8

recordkeeper's seal was not considered evidence, per se.

9

It was a foundational requirement to put evidence in.

10

And so, in this Court's words in the Dowdell case, it's

11

something like a court reporter's transcript that goes

12

up to a Court of Appeals and then is looked at.

13

not considered evidence against a criminal defendant.

14

Now, in stark contrast to this case where

15

the document is expressly citing to a statute of

criminal charge is satisfied.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why don't you insist, even

13

in that case, on the confrontation right to examine the

14

person who actually conducted the test itself and

15

generated the papers that the later expert testifies on

16

in order to determine the admissibility of the -- of

17

the -- the test results themselves?

18

MR. FISHER:

I think the defendant may have

19

that right.

20

to suggest that that chain of custody was stipulated to

21

or otherwise agreed.

22
23
24
25

I understood Justice Kennedy's hypothetical

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

All I wanted to know

was whether you were giving that away or not.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, but chain of custody

is -- is quite different from the quantitative analysis

laboratory, the paper is produced, an outside witness

5

that that suffices.

here's what I'm saying.

My question is only chain

I did.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I thought you said

So I think I'm -

Let me ask you this.

There

are -- there are -- there are three possibility

10

subjects:

11

significance or meaning of the squiggles.

12

understand it, you have said if the chain of custody is

13

established and if the squiggles are admitted in

14

evidence, an expert who did not do the test can testify

15

about the significance of the squiggles.

16

leaves the question of the -- the evidence about the

17

conduct of the test itself.

And I understood you to say to me that you

19

were not conceding that you did not have a -- a

20

confrontation right to examine the person who did the

21

test itself in order to determine admissibility.

22

MR. FISHER:

I think what we are doing here

23

is disagreeing slightly over where chain of custody

24

begins and ends.
