Municipal Utility District v. Holder.

Mr. Coleman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

9
10

MR. COLEMAN:

Good morning, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

After more than 20 years of steadfast

12

compliance with the Voting Rights Act, Northwest Austin

13

MUD Number One is entitled to be free from the intrusive

14

burdens of preclearance.

15

seek a bailout because it is a political subdivision

16

under the Court's decisions in Sheffield and Dougherty

17

County.

18

preclearance allows bailout to serve its ameliorative

19

purposes of encouraging, recognizing, and rewarding

20

long-term compliance and progress -

21

The district is entitled to

This natural parallelism between bailout and

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It may be -- it may

22

be a political subdivision under those decisions, but

23

it's certainly not a political subdivision under the

24

statutory definition.

25

MR. COLEMAN:

Well, we disagree with that,
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Your Honor.

2

particular, the Court specifically recognized that these

3

entities such as cities and school boards and utility

4

districts are political subdivisions and that that term

5

as it's used -

6

We believe that under Dougherty County in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Bailout wasn't involved

7

in those cases.

And what do you do with a statute that

8

has three categories -- the State, political

9

subdivision, and then there's "governmental unit"?

The

10

district qualifies as a governmental unit.

11

Congress add that third category if the district came

12

within "political subdivision"?

13

MR. COLEMAN:

Why would

Justice Ginsburg, the term

14

"governmental unit" doesn't actually appear in the

15

provision that authorizes bailout.

16

when a political subdivision seeks a bailout that, if it

17

has any governmental units within it, it must also

18

ensure that they are compliant before it can have a

19

bailout.

20

political subdivision of the county, it is in the

21

county, and therefore under the substantive criteria, if

22

the -- Travis County wanted to bail out, it would have

23

to demonstrate compliance of all of those governmental

24

units within it.

25

What it says is that

For instance, although the district is not a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but the -- but the

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute does use the term "governmental unit" to

2

encompass districts.

3

subdivisions, why would Congress need to add an

4

additional category?

5

And if they were also

MR. COLEMAN:

Again, I disagree with Your

6

Honor that -- that the term "governmental unit" appears

7

in the provision that defines criteria.

8
9
10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It appears in the statute

twice, suggesting that Congress had in mind three
categories.

11

MR. COLEMAN:

Again, the statute that

12

defines who's eligible to bailout says a State, a

13

political subdivision that has been separately

14

designated for coverage under 4(b), and a political

15

subdivision that has not been separately designated for

16

coverage.

17

We were never separately designated for

18

coverage.

And under Sheffield and Dougherty County, we

19

have long been considered a political subdivision.

20

Indeed, we are subject to the process of preclearance

21

only because we were a political subdivision.

22

actual requirement that you send in preclearance

23

submissions is on political subdivisions.

24

subject to lawsuits under section 2 because we are a

25

political subdivision.

We are

We are subject to the
5

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

possibility of Federal examiners because we are a

2

political subdivision.

3

At no place in this Voting Rights Act, in

4

any of the dozens of the uses of the term "political

5

subdivision" has this Court or Congress, other than the

6

designation statute, separately suggested that a

7

political subdivision such as the district would not be

8

considered a political subdivision under the terms of

9

the Voting Rights Act.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, to the extent we

11

have some latitude in construing the Act, certainly it

12

would be a relevant factor if we concluded that it's

13

just unworkable or impractical to have an uncovered

14

jurisdiction within a county which is a covered

15

jurisdiction.

16

competing election formulae.

17

that that just makes compliance with the Act much more

18

difficult.

19

They would have competing election days,

MR. COLEMAN:

And it would seem to me

Well, certainly we believe

20

that the purposes of the Act suggest that we should be

21

considered a political subdivision eligible to bail out.

22

This interaction between the county and the district -

23

we -- we exist within the county, but we are not part of

24

the county.

25

us.

The county, as we say, is not the boss of

They don't have any way to ensure or require us to
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

do things.

2

not only did the county have different political

3

interests, but we've also demonstrated that because you

4

have entities that are subject to separate designation,

5

like the county, that have dozens and perhaps in this

6

case over a hundred separate political subdivisions,

7

Travis County could never practically seek a bail out.

8

And in order to give effect to what I call

9

And as the facts of this case demonstrate,

this ameliorative purpose to bail out, the Court should

10

interpret the statute in a way that allows these small

11

entities to bail out.

12

These small entities -

JUSTICE ALITO:

And how do you account for

13

the fact that if your district were located in a

14

separately covered political subdivision, you clearly

15

could not bail out.

16

MR. COLEMAN:

Well, I -- I -- again, the

17

Court doesn't need to reach that question yet, but I'm

18

not sure that the answer is that we clearly couldn't if

19

we were a separately designated or -- excuse me -- if we

20

were in a separately designated county that says -

21

that's it's not in a covered State, right?

22

this argument, for instance, that -- that that State

23

could be covered in whole or in part.

24

for instance, in California the State is -- is covered

25

in part.

There is

And certainly,

And it could be resolved in that way.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The statute is not exceptionally clear on

2

it, but the Court doesn't have to reach that because we

3

are in a fully covered State, and we are -- under all

4

the provisions of Voting Rights Act, have always been

5

considered political subdivisions.

6

said you're a political subdivision for every purpose

7

except this one.

8
9

The district court

You have to -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There is -- the district

court had some assistance from the legislative

10

development of this latest extension.

11

proposal, was there not, to allow governmental units to

12

bail out -- to allow anyone who was required to preclear

13

to bail out?

14

MR. COLEMAN:

There was a

I don't know that there was a

15

specific legislative proposal, Justice Ginsburg.

16

was certainly some discussion of that.

17

particularly clear is -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It was simply part

I'm not aware of any specific resistance
There weren't any amendments to the

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

very important to the Court's consideration of that

2

because the bailout aspects were considered in City of

3

Rome, and in City of Rome the only entities that could

4

bail out were a -- were a State or a separately covered

5

or a separately designated subdivision.

6

years after that, Congress amends the statute to add

7

this third category, which is political subdivisions

8

that have not been separately designated for coverage.

9

And then 2

That amendment and that addition is clearly

10

in direct response to City of Rome and, we believe, a

11

clear indication that Congress did intend and, indeed,

12

it said it intended to expand the bailout opportunities.

13

Congress believed that many, if perhaps not most,

14

political subdivisions in 1982 would be eligible for

15

bailout, but because -

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Department of Justice

17

has -- does it -- does it not have a regulation that

18

contradicts your reading?

19

there -- wasn't it out there before the 2006 extension?

20

MR. COLEMAN:

And hasn't that been out

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but

21

unlike the Attorney General's regulations that relate to

22

preclearance, bailout is not something that the Attorney

23

General actually has any specific say in.

The statute

24

provides for a lawsuit to seek a bailout.

It's not like

25

preclearance, where can you get it from either the
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Attorney General or the district court.

2

Now, the Attorney General may choose, as it

3

has for several of the Virginia entities, not to resist

4

that.

5

General has been convinced, but -

6

So you can file a friendly suit once the Attorney

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If we find that you're not

7

covered by the bailout provision, that only the county

8

is, do you really then have standing to proceed to

9

question the workability of the bailout procedures?

I

10

-- I suppose that would be a threshold argument for you

11

to question the validity of the Act.

12

MR. COLEMAN:

Well, with respect to our

13

constitutionality issue, Justice Kennedy, one thing

14

nobody is contesting here is that we are not subject to

15

preclearance.

16

bailout, we obviously do and we believe have standing to

17

assert that the reenactment of the preclearance

18

provisions is unconstitutional because they, unlike the

19

bailout, would clearly continue to apply to us.

2

government over preclearing anything, I'm not sure why

3

you would be in court.

MR. COLEMAN:

Well, there is certainly a

possibility we may seek to preclear things in the

6

future, but this is primarily -

So between 2004 and 2009 the district has not

sought preclearance?

And so 2004 is the last

That's correct.

This lawsuit

--

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you're subject to

14

preclearance and you cannot make changes without going

15

to the Attorney General and asking for his permission.

16

MR. COLEMAN:

That's correct.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is it any different from,

18

from a -- a Federal law prohibiting certain speech?

19

you have to subject yourself to the -- to the penalty

20

for that speech before you can attack the law?

21

think so.

MR. COLEMAN:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do

I don't

No, Justice Scalia.
But the suit -- correct me

24

if I'm wrong, and I may be wrong on this, but I thought

25

this suit eventuated from the fact that you had been
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

denied bailout and that your entire case was brought on

2

the refusal of bailout.

3

had brought a general declaratory judgment action or

4

a -- or a facial attack in gross, as it were, on the

5

statute.

6

I did not understand that you

Am I wrong about your pleadings?
MR. COLEMAN:

7

that, Justice Souter.

8

The suit sought bailout.

is through the lawsuit -

I do think you're wrong about

We had not been denied bailout.
The only way to seek a bailout

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

11

MR. COLEMAN:

Right.

-- and this lawsuit seeks the

12

bailout and the declaratory judgment that if we cannot

bail out -

14
15
16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You separately asked for

declaratory judgment?
MR. COLEMAN:

Yes.

There are different

17

claims in the lawsuit, Your Honor.

18

standing point is-

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And indeed, the

You don't challenge -- if

20

you have bailout, say we accept your reading of the

21

statute, you are not contesting the constitutionality of

22

the act if it matched your obligation to preclear with

23

the right to bail out.

24
25

MR. COLEMAN:
either, Justice Ginsburg.

Well, that's not exactly right
We certainly contest and
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

contend that preclearance is unconstitutional.

2

acknowledge that if the Court were to give us bailout

3

that the Court might choose on its own not to reach the

4

constitutional issues because we would receive relief.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We

But I -- I thought I just

6

heard you say even if you got the bailout the extension

7

for another 25 years would still be unconstitutional.

8

Is that -- or are you saying that the accommodation, the

9

modification, would suffice to make the statute

10

constitutional?

11

MR. COLEMAN:

No.

We do not say that the

12

modification would make the statute constitutional.

13

position is both that we are entitled to bailout and we

14

have an alternative claim that we have asserted that is

15

independent, it's not dependent on the first one, that

16

preclearance is unconstitutional.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Our

Well Mr. Coleman, this is

18

important to me.

19

we find on your favor on the bailout point we need not

20

reach the constitutional point?

21
22
23

Do you -- do you acknowledge that if

MR. COLEMAN:

I do acknowledge that, Justice

Souter.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, presumably you

24

wouldn't have standing to raise it because you wouldn't

25

be subject to the preclearance requirement.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. COLEMAN:

Right.

But because we had all

2

the claims together in one lawsuit, we had to assert

3

them all together, and that's what we've done.

4

Getting to the heart of this preclearance

5

issue, if I may, Katzenbach recognized that preclearance

6

really was an extraordinary remedy and it recognized

7

that is a remedy that would not otherwise be appropriate

8

but for the extraordinary emergency circumstances that

9

existed at the time.

10
11

Nobody has challenged that.

we are in a different day.

But

The kinds of -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Coleman, may I just

12

raise a basic point here.

13

that it affects my view of your argument.

14

to start with it.

15

assumption that things have significantly changed and

16

that therefore Congress could not by whatever test we

17

use extend the -- extend section 5.

18

And I'll be candid with you
I just want

Your argument is largely based on the

But what we've got in the record in front of

19

us -- I don't have a laundry list to read, but I mean,

20

we've got I think at the present time a 6-point -- a

21

16-point registration difference on Hispanic and

22

non-Hispanic white voters in Texas.

23

of some 600 interpositions by the -- by the Justice

24

Department on section 5 proceedings, section 5

25

objections, over a period of about 20 years.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

We've got a record

We got a

record that about two-thirds of them were based on the

2

Justice Department's view that it was intentional

3

discrimination.

4

lawsuits over the same period of time.

5

We've got something like 600 section 2

The point that I'm getting at is I don't

6

understand, with a record like that, how you can

7

maintain as a basis for this suit that things have

8

radically changed.

9

they have radically changed to the point that this

They may be better.

But to say that

10

becomes an unconstitutional section 5 exercise within

11

Congress's judgment just seems to me to -- to deny the

12

empirical reality.

13

I mean, what it your answer to that?

MR. COLEMAN:

Our answer, Your Honor, is -

14

is a very clear one and that is there is a difference

15

between a nondiscrimination statute and a

16

noncircumvention statute.

17

prohibition on the uses of tests and devices, these are

18

clear nondiscrimination provisions that are textually

19

linked back to the -- to the constitutional

prohibitions.

Well, the evidence that

I've been getting into is a pretty good indication -- I

25

would have thought Congress thought so and I would have
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

thought so too -- that there is something to be

2

concerned about on the issue of circumvention; that in

3

fact the attitudes have not so radically changed as to

4

render circumvention irrelevant.

5

MR. COLEMAN:

6

Justice Souter, on that.

7

I honestly disagree with you,
Notwithstanding -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there was -- but

8

there was -- Congress fastened on that issue and it

9

referred to second generation discrimination, which is a

10

frequent pattern with discrimination.

11

the blatant overt discrimination, and then in time

12

people recognize that that's -- that won't go any more,

13

so the discrimination becomes more subtle, less easy to

14

smoke out.

15

discrimination to everything is equal.

16

You start with

But it doesn't go from blatant overt

MR. COLEMAN:

Justice Ginsburg, the Court in

17

Katzenbach recognized that Congress had been trying for

18

several years to try to fix this problem and it walked

19

through, as this Court has walked through innumerable

20

times, that section 5 is simply not about

21

nondiscrimination, but it was about the unremitting and

22

ingenious defiance of statutes in a way that made

23

ordinary enforcement mechanisms, including litigation,

24

simply ineffective, that no matter what the courts did,

25

in the South the enforcement mechanisms were unable to
17

9

No, I'll ask you that

MR. COLEMAN:

Notwithstanding that record,

it is not the kind of record -- Congress put together

10

what it believed was a discrimination record, but not a

11

circumvention record.

12

instance, in these types of examples that have been

13

offered in the briefs and were offered in the

14

congressional hearings that these aren't things that can

15

be fixed through ordinary enforcement mechanisms through

16

section 2 litigation.

17

There is no indication, for

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if you take the

18

multiple devices -- take the one as simple as moving the

19

election day so that it will coincide with the -- with

20

the holiday of a predominantly minority college.

21

after every change of that order with a section 2

22

23

effective to smoke that out.

What is your response?

MR. COLEMAN:

Well, I'm obviously not going

to have time to respond to all of that, Justice Breyer.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. COLEMAN:

Whatever you want.

But, for instance, with

21

respect to the first point that you raised, which is

22

voter registration and turnout issues, those numbers

23

don't tell the whole story.

24

respect to both black and Hispanic voters, the record in

25

covered jurisdictions is above the national average.

In fact -- in fact, with

Massachusetts, for instance, you might be learned to

2

know, has a white-black voter registration and turnout

3

differential that is in the high 20s, far in excess of

4

any covered jurisdiction.

5

Congress didn't do.

6

And that's part of what

So in addition to the argument we have that the

7

record Congress produced is really a nondiscrimination

8

record and not a circumvention record, we also have the

9

argument that we've made that it is simply irrational

10

for Congress to go back and say the Voting Rights Act of

11

1965 was intended to make sure that minority voters

12

could register and vote and that's going to be our

13

number one priority.

14

As Justice Ginsburg recognized, Congress

15

believes that that has been satisfied.

16

going to go back and in determining who's going to be

17

covered under the 2006 amendment, we are going to use

18

the same data from the 1964 election.

19

But now we are

It would have been as if Congress in 1965

20

said:

21

in order to define coverage, we are going to look at the

22

Roosevelt-Hoover election in 1932 and registration and

23

turnout then, because we think that is the best way to

24

evaluate -

25

We anticipate that there are problems here; and,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, Justice Breyer -

Official - Subject to Final Review

Justice Breyer did refer you to some other more current

2

statistics, submissions, Title V suits, and so forth.

3

You might want to address those.

4

was there any control data to compare preclearance rates

5

or preclearance events in colored -- in covered

6

jurisdictions as opposed to uncovered jurisdictions?

7

MR. COLEMAN:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And in that context,

That's And that -- that's part of

9

the showing, it seems to me, that the Congress has to

10

make, that these States that are now covered and that

11

were covered are markedly different from the noncovered

12

jurisdictions.

13

the Congress or the district court to address that

14

point?

15

Was there anything in the record before

MR. COLEMAN:

The only comparative data that

16

existed was of two kinds.

17

some data that grouped all covered jurisdictions into

18

one lump and all noncovered jurisdictions into another

19

lump and counted up section 2 lawsuits.

20

difference was about 17 successful -- 17 more successful

21

section 2 suits in covered jurisdictions than in

22

noncovered jurisdictions.

23

There was a -- there was a -

And the

That's not a big difference.

What Congress didn't do, though, is look at

24

specific noncovered jurisdictions, for instance, the

25

ones I've cited, and say, how do these compare to
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

covered jurisdictions?

2

And the other thing it didn't do is say:

3

Among covered jurisdictions and noncovered

4

jurisdictions, let's look among -- let's separate out

5

among these jurisdictions and see where the problem

6

locations are and what areas we think might, if -- if

7

preclearance is going to be constitutional, might be

8

subject.

There is absolutely no evidence in the record

9

of that.

Preclearance once again is based on the

10

results -- well, whether there was a test or device in

11

the 1960s and the results of the 1964, 1968, and 1972

12

presidential elections.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What kind of coverage

formula would be adequate?

15

preservation of the same coverage formula.

other coverage formula could it come up with?

MR. COLEMAN:

You are attacking Congress'
But what

Well, just to give one example

18

-- and I'm not -- not recommending this -- but if, for

19

instance, the same coverage formula had been applied to

20

the 2000 and 2004 elections, equalizing for citizen

21

voting age population, the only covered State would have

22

been Hawaii.

there was quite a bit more than that.

MR. COLEMAN:

I -- I actually dispute that.

12

There is a lot of discussion of that information, Your

If that's its objective, what can it

MR. COLEMAN:

It needed to make an

4

evaluation of where there is an actual risk of

5

backsliding and where there is actual evidence of

6

circumvention.

7

We don't believe that.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We don't -

What about the evidence

8

that Justice Breyer summarized, that I alluded to?

I

9

mean those -- that is simply evidence of racial attitude

10

and it seems to me in the real world that can be taken

11

as evidence that if the -- if the section 5 safeguard is

12

taken away, the pushback is going to start.

13

MR. COLEMAN:

That evidence -

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

MR. COLEMAN:

It has never stopped.

That evidence justifies strict

16

enforcement of nondiscrimination statutes, but it does

17

not justify a presumption that State and local officials

18

in these areas are so racist that they cannot be relied

19

on to pass and enforce fair voting laws.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They couldn't -- they

21

couldn't be relied upon apparently in the some 200 cases

22

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE HOLDER

21

MR. KATYAL:

22
23

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
And let me begin where Mr. Coleman left off,

24

because I don't think that his argument adequately

25

grapples either with this Court's consistent upholding
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the provision at issue 4 times over 4 decades or with

2

Congress's action in 2006.

3

in 2006 was the paradigmatic attempt of what to do in

4

Congress.

5

aspersions at Supreme Court doctrine.

6

that doctrine seriously, both this Court's teachings

7

with respect to the Voting Rights Act specifically, as

8

well as the -- as the scope of the Congress's

9

Reconstruction enforcement powers, and arrived at a

10

Congress's reauthorization

It didn't redefine a rate, nor did it cast
Rather, it took

considered judgment.

11

After 16,000 pages of testimony, 21

12

different hearings over 10 months, Congress looked at

13

the evidence and determined that their work was not

14

done.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, the -- the

16

-- our -- our decision in City of Boerne said that

17

action under section 5 has to be congruent and

18

proportional to what it's trying to remedy.

19

understand it, one-twentieth of 1 percent of the

20

submissions are not precleared.

21

that they are sweeping far more broadly than they need

22

to, to address the intentional discrimination under the

23

Fifteenth Amendment.

24
25

MR. KATYAL:
Mr. Chief Justice.

Here, as I

That, to me, suggests

I -- I disagree with that,

I think what that represents is that
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

section 5 is actually working very well; that it

2

provides a deterrent.

3

Indeed, Mr. Coleman himself testified before Congress

4

and said the low objection rate is evidence that it

5

isn't congruent to proportional.

6

This was a debate in Congress.

The Congress disagreed with that.

What it

7

found instead was that section 5 was deterring the

8

problem.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's like

10

the old -- you know, it's the elephant whistle.

11

know, I have this whistle to keep away the elephants.

12

You know, well, that's silly.

13

elephants, so it must work.

14

You

Well, there are no

I mean, if you have 99.98 percent of these

15

being precleared, why isn't that reaching far too

16

broadly.

17

MR. KATYAL:

Well, let me suggest another

18

example.

19

United States Courts said there were approximately

20

17,500 requests for Title 3 wiretaps in the past 10

21

years.

22

percent rejection rate.

23

Yesterday the Administrative Office for the

Four of them had been rejected.

That's a .023

But I don't think one could use those

24

numbers and say, oh, that means that Title 3 doesn't

25

deter or prevent abusive wiretaps.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

What it suggests

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

instead, if Congress would have found -- I agree that if

2

we were just standing up with no record whatsoever,

3

that's one thing, but if Congress heard testimony, they

4

found example after example of -

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

parallel isn't there.

7

intentional discrimination.

8

against wiretapping.

9

intentional discrimination.

No, the parallel -- the

I mean, there are laws against
So there should be laws

There should also be laws against
But where the -- the

10

argument here is not that those laws be eliminated.

11

It's just that the preclearance requirements be

12

eliminated.

13

MR. KATYAL:

Absolutely.

And Congress found

14

with respect to those intentional -- laws that prevent

15

intentional vote discrimination, which is section 2,

16

which you hear Mr. Coleman relying on today, that that

17

is ineffective for the same reasons that this Court has

18

found them repeatedly in South Carolina v. Katzenbach,

19

in City of Rome.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

A long time ago.

How much

21

of the evidence that Congress amassed was specifically

22

circumvention evidence?

23

MR. KATYAL:

Quite a bit of evidence about

24

the ineffectiveness of section 2 as a remedy.

25

the statement for the intervenors -- there's a 500-page
29
Alderson Reporting Company

So -- and

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statement filed before the district court which excerpts

2

the congressional record.

3

see a long series of -- a long analysis by Congress

4

about how section 2 is ineffective, that it costs too

5

much to bring the litigation, that there are few

6

attorneys that will handle it, that -- that there isn't

7

enough money and that -

8
9

In the pages 270 to 279 you

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if section 2 is

ineffective, then why didn't Congress extend section 5

10

to the entire country?

Could Congress have reauthorized

11

section 5 without identifying significant differences

12

between the few jurisdictions that are covered and the

13

rest of the country?

14

MR. KATYAL:

15

Congress had to make some showing.

16

explicit legislative findings that say that section 5 is

17

needed in these areas -

18

I don't believe so.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think

And here there are

Not comparative, however.

19

Not comparative with the rest of the country except

20

in -- in -

21

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I disagree with that for

22

several reasons.

First of all, and most I think what

23

this utility district can argue about is Texas, and

24

Congress found very specific evidence about

25

discrimination in the State of Texas.
30
Alderson Reporting Company

They found that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they led the country in the number of objections.

2

found that the -- that the registration rates, as

3

Justice Souter said, between Hispanics and whites was

4

great.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

They

Well, it's 18 percent.

If

6

these statistics are correct, the difference between

7

Latino registration and white registration in Texas was

8

18.6 percent, which is not good, but it's substantially

9

lower than the rate in California, which is not covered,

10

37 percent; Colorado, 28 percent; New Mexico, 24

11

percent; the nationwide average, 30 percent.

12

MR. KATYAL:

Well, again, I think that what

13

Congress found is that the rate in Texas coupled with

14

its historical amount of discrimination together

15

justified -- justified the reauthorization of section 5.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, let me focus

17

on that historical aspect.

18

history here and that the history was different.

19

what point does that history seek -- stop justifying

20

action with respect to some jurisdictions but not with

21

respect to others that show greater disparities?

22

MR. KATYAL:

Obviously no one doubts the
But at

Again, I think what this Court

23

has -- has answered that question in Katzenbach by

24

saying it may be the case that there are other

25

jurisdictions discriminate more, Congress can deal with
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

the problem one step at a time.

2

has said that the Court should be particularly worried

3

about trying to predict the future and say that

4

discrimination is now over.

5

And the -- and Congress

We have fairly good -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, so your answer

6

is that Congress can impose this disparate treatment

7

forever because of the history in the south?

8

MR. KATYAL:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10
11

Absolutely not.
When can they -

when can they -- when do they have to stop?
MR. KATYAL:

Well, Congress here said 25

13

reauthorization period.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, they said five

15

17

is going to go on forever.

18

MR. KATYAL:

Well, again, if Congress can't

19

20

within its powers to -- to strike it down.

22

done before, which is to use its Fifteenth -- to say

23

I can tell you there are -- there are approximately

11

30 attorneys who work in the voting -

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Thirty attorneys.

quarrel with the assessment -- the testimony before the

that is relevant?

21

MR. KATYAL:

dignity of Michigan.

7

And does the United States take that position today?

8
9

And the governments in one are to

MR. KATYAL:
those terms.

The

I wouldn't put it at all in

I would say what Congress found is that

10

there is a historical amount of discrimination coupled

11

with recent evidence and comparative data between

12

covered and noncovered jurisdictions that justifies

13

continuation of a remedy that States now overwhelmingly

14

appreciate.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, then my point

16

stands.

You say that there is a basis for treating

17

States quite differently as to the -- this fundamental

18

right that we all agree on with respect to voting.

19

what's happened in part is that because of section 5

20

preclearance, say, a minority opportunity district is

21

protected in covered jurisdictions and not in noncovered

22

jurisdictions.

23

MR. KATYAL:

But -- but This is -- this is a great

disparity in treatment, and the government of the United

differently.

3

you're going to make that case.

4

And you have a very substantial burden if

MR. KATYAL:

Justice Kennedy, their burden

5

is the same as it has always been in South Carolina

6

versus Katzenbach and City of Rome.

7

Congress to say is continuation of this landmark

achievement, one of the most transformative acts in

American history, still justified, because with this act

The burden is on

10

what Congress -- what Congress did was essentially

redeem itself in the eyes of the world.

12

the validity, the urgency, the essentiality of the

14

Voting Rights Act.

15

should be continued with this differentiation between

16

the States.

17

The question is whether or not it

And that is for Congress to show.
MR. KATYAL:

And Congress did show precisely

18

that.

19

that -- that the differential between covered and

20

noncovered States with respect to section 2 lawsuits was

21

57 percent of successful section 2 lawsuits were filed

22

in covered jurisdictions, even though they are 25

23

percent of the population -

24
25

They showed, for example, Justice Kennedy,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

your brother told us the disparity between Hispanic and

2

non-Hispanic voting is far greater than jurisdictions

4

MR. KATYAL:

Because that -- because, again,

5

that is only one aspect of the overall problem, the

6

amount of registration rates or something like that.

7

What Congress has historically done ever since the

inception of the Voting Rights Act is target those

Justice Kennedy, I don't quite think said that defiance

was the precondition; rather it found that the onerous

amount of case-by-case litigation itself wasn't enough.

17

And I would caution this Court because this Court has

had examples before in which the historical record

looked good at a narrow moment in time.

not just registration rates; it's the fact that they

MR. KATYAL:

Yes, absolutely, because that's

what City of Rome argued in 1980, and what this Court

MR. ADEGBILE:

The number is 18.
Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11

Our long experience demonstrates that racial

12

discrimination in voting has been persistent and

adaptive.

did Congress find that the case-by-case method was

inadequate and that section 5 continued to do important

20

voting discrimination is such that small changes in the

rules of the game can affect many people.

the Court has observed, as Congress has on multiple

48
Alderson Reporting Company

I think the

Official - Subject to Final Review

3

Those are illustrative and not exhaustive, but

repetitious violations, that is, violations in covered

5

jurisdictions after a section 2 case -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There are very -

So your answer is

yes?
MR. ADEGBILE:

I think that it's fair to say

that the pattern has been more repetitious violations in

10

the covered jurisdictions and -- and more one off

11

discrimination in other places.

12

That is not to say that there isn't voting

13

discrimination in other States.

14

there is discrimination in other States.

15

Congress found that the nature of the way the

16

discrimination is practiced, viewed through the lens of

17

history, is that repetitive violations happen.

18

example, after this Court decided the LULAC case, a case

19

that was litigated over a number of months and very

20

expensive and complicated, the State then tried to

21

shorten the period for early voting.

22

in that case needed to file a section 5 enforcement

23

action, post-2000 redistricting, to give effect to this

24

Court's judgment.

25

The record shows that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
49
Alderson Reporting Company

But the -- but

For

And the plaintiffs

So -- but I guess

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that point depends upon the assumption that shortening

2

the time period for early voting is discriminatory as

3

opposed to good policy.

4

MR. ADEGBILE:

I think in the context of

5

that circumstance, Justice -- Chief Justice Roberts, the

6

issue was that you had a long-standing incumbent and

7

that the early voting -- the timing of the early voting

8

period was such that it was going to conflict with a -

9

a holiday of -- of a -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. ADEGBILE:

So that was largely

To protect the incumbent, but

13

to disadvantage the community that was prepared to

14

exercise its voice, as this Court found in the LULAC

15

opinion.

That is to say -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

MR. ADEGBILE:

candidate of choice.

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Congress did not
It took a very

Official - Subject to Final Review

careful examination to see how it was operating, and the

determination was that in the absence of section 5,

percent of those show some evidence of intentional

most of the infractions not all but most when many

2

voting changes are necessary through reapportionment.

3

Not all of them involved reapportionment but many of

4

them are necessitated and the judgment was that it was

5

going to capture two censuses and they also looked back

6

to see how much discrimination they found from 1962 to

7

reauthorization.

8

And indeed Congress has been a little bit

9

surprised they have not been able to dislodge more of

10

the discrimination.

They acknowledged the progress.

11

Progress didn't happen by itself and the experience had

12

been that it was helping us to move forward and that is

13

reflected I think in the State's brief to come to

14

Justice Kennedy's point.

15

This Court's decisions have recognized that Section 5

16

does intrude but even in Bernie as the court

17

distinguished Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act from

18

the, many of the statutes that were there at issue in

19

this case, RFRA, certainly other cases followed, the

20

court kept returning to section 5 because the problem

21

had been demonstrated by Congress.

22

harm was so severe that Congress needed a special

mechanism to dislodge it because if we don't have the

justice of the supreme court currently.

7

MR. ADEGBILE:

Yes, indeed it was.
And it has a black chief

Yes, Justice Scalia, I take

8

the point.

But I think it's not quite fair to say.

As

9

my predecessor at the podium made the point, that there

10

have been African-Americans to rise to high office

11

throughout our history, but that occasion of a single

12

person sitting in a seat doesn't change the experience

13

on the ground for everyday citizens.

14

It is -- it has an important salutory effect

15

and it tells us about the possibilities of our

16

Constitution, but it doesn't mean that voters that are

17

trying to vote in a school board election in Louisiana

18

are going to have an easy time of it where racially

19

polarized voting is as extreme as it is and when

20

election officials manipulate the rules of the game to

21

try and disadvantage the minority community.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, the brief filed by

23

the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the first 15 pages I think

24

makes a good demonstration of discrete discriminatory

25

acts; and the brief filed by Nathaniel, Professor
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Percelly, makes an important point about crossovers in

2

different -- my concern is it's just not clear to me

3

that Congress addressed this for the rest of the

4

country.

That's my concern.

5

MR. ADEGBILE:

I think the close -- the best

6

evidence of the comparison question to which you're

7

returning is the section 2 cases that were examined in a

8

report that was submitted to Congress.

9

Appellants recognize in their brief, 600 -

And as

10

notwithstanding the powerful section 5 remedy, there

11

were 653 successful section 2 cases in covered

12

jurisdictions, and the success rate in covered

13

jurisdictions was much higher than in noncovered

14

jurisdictions.

15

So when you put together the objections, the

16

requests for more information followed by withdrawals,

17

the section 5 enforcement actions, the section 2 cases,

18

it is a picture that far exceeds the record that was

19

before this august body when considering enactments of

20

Congress in other contexts in Hibbs and in Lane, and the

21

record was of intentional discrimination, not simply

22

disparities but purposeful efforts to disadvantaged

23

minority groups.

24

difference between the covered jurisdictions and the

25

noncovered.

And I think that's the fundamental

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the cases

2

you're talking about include both intentional and impact

3

cases.

4

to implement covers only intentional discrimination.

5

even the examples you have given sweep broadly as a

6

prophylactic measure and then the section 5 preclearance

7

of course sweeps even more broadly.

8

situation, despite the evidence that was -- that you

9

have cited, where less than one-twentieth of 1 percent

And the Constitution that section 5 is designed

So we do have a

10

of the submissions that the States make are denied

11

preclearance.

12

So

Again, it seems to me that that means that

13

section 5 sweeps very, very broadly.

14

MR. ADEGBILE:

I think there are two

15

responses.

First, the relevant assessment is not simply

16

the rate.

17

objections even at the time of the 1975 re-authorization

18

in Rome was very small.

19

in his opinion and in the oral argument.

20

always been small.

21

is to vindicate the principles of our Constitution, and

22

the gravity of the harm is such that if we have 620

23

examples of discrimination and 60 percent of those are

24

intentional discrimination together with some of the

25

other indicia and under this Court's cases Congress is

As the lower court found, the rate of

Judge Tatel spoke to this point
The rate has

But what section 5 is designed to do

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

entitled to look broadly, not simply at the decided

2

case, but to look broadly and to be the factfinder of

3

this important information.

4

This is a pattern.

It's a widespread

5

pattern of intentional discrimination, and I think that

6

that is something that this Court needs to focus on as

7

it works through this important and serious issue.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

I have another question.

10
11
12
13

Thank you.
How long did it

take Congress to compile this 13,000-page record?
MR. ADEGBILE:

Approximately 10 months,

Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:

And how long would it have

14

taken Congress in your opinion to have compiled the

15

record to figure out what's happening in this respect in

16

every State or in these States district by district?

17

MR. ADEGBILE:

I think that I can't put a

18

precise time on it, but it would have been certainly a

19

couple more years.

20

compile these investigations and the expertise that's

21

necessary to assemble them and cull the data takes some

22

time in my personal experience.

23

The time that is necessary to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So your position is

24

that it makes no difference if discrimination in the

25

noncovered jurisdiction is more widespread and more
58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

persistent; it doesn't matter, because Congress can

2

focus solely on the jurisdictions that have been covered

3

since 1965?

4

MR. ADEGBILE:

I make a slightly different

5

point.

I don't think that it doesn't matter at all.

I

6

think Congress has to act reasonably, but in light of

7

the record before it its judgment to stay the course in

8

the covered jurisdictions because of the way voting

9

discrimination has manifested itself in those

10

jurisdictions, that judgment is reasonable on the record

11

it had before it.

12

section 2 has proven more adequate to the task in other

13

jurisdictions that don't have the same history of

14

repetitive violations.

15

It made a judgment in effect that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I guess your

16

answer is that they can address the covered

17

jurisdictions that have been covered since 1965 without

18

looking at all to the rest of the country?

19

MR. ADEGBILE:

I think that if things were

20

flipped and discrimination was much worse outside, that

21

would reflect on the reasonableness of Congress'

22

judgment.

23

present before Congress.

But that's a fact situation that was not

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN

4

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

5

MR. COLEMAN:

But, as Justice Alito pointed

out, Congress didn't know, because it didn't ask,

7

whether discrimination is worse in Tennessee or Arkansas

8

than in Virginia and other States.

9

here today.

10

Nobody knows sitting

I respectfully disagree that Congress

What's your estimate?

that.

21

things on the ground in a variety of noncovered

22

jurisdictions such as Milwaukee.

23

within the time that Congress took to look at this if

24

they had been interested they could have easily

evaluated this.

I certainly think

It would have been easily available to

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, they now have 25 years

3

to look at, or 24 years, to look at the rest of the

country.

hearings?

6

Are they doing that?

MR. COLEMAN:

Are they holding

No, nobody is doing that.

7

answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, that's what

8

Congress did in 1982.

9

has gone by.

10

It said 25 years.

In

That 25 years

Times have changed.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, this Court said -

11

-- it was not 1982, it was two thousand something.

12

Court thought from two thousand something 25 years was a

13

reasonable period.

14

MR. COLEMAN:

This

Congress' justification simply

15

does -- I think as we've heard from counsel, in light of

16

our mobile society and the fact that people don't live

17

in the same place people lived 40 years ago.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

This is a

Let me ask this question

20

just as sort of background.

21

all the standards that Congress has used throughout the

22

statute for causing States to become covered

23

jurisdictions?

24
25

MR. COLEMAN:

Does your case challenge at

Well the only standards that

exist are whether they use a test or devise in the
61
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1960s.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Correct.

Have you ever

3

challenged those as a basis for making a State or county

4

or election district covered?

5

MR. COLEMAN:

I don't think we've challenged

6

the action that took place -

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, you have a history

8

that some States are covered and some are not because of

9

certain requirements that the statute imposed.

And I

10

didn't understand the case to involve a challenge to the

11

method by which States became -- become covered.

12
13

MR. COLEMAN:
challenge that.

14

No, Justice Stevens, we do

In fact -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Then why is it relevant

15

there are a lot of States out there that are not

16

covered?

17

MR. COLEMAN:

Because this Court's

18

discussions of these issues in Morris and in Garrett and

19

even in Hibbs indicate that it does matter what the

20

evidence shows with respect to a coverage determination,

21

and Congress' decision to not update it, which we

22

believe was for political reasons, simply bears no

23

resemblance to reality.

24

registered and who was voting in the '60s doesn't -

25

And looking back to see who was

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Are you arguing the

62
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute is unconstitutional because Congress failed to

2

extend it to other -- other parts of the country?

3

MR. COLEMAN:

No, I don't think that's our

4

argument.

5

unconstitutional because it even failed to look at the

6

coverage criteria and that it used the criteria

7

literally off the books from the '60s and '70s without

8

even looking at the information.

9

I think our argument is it's partially

Again, if Congress had done that in 1965 and

10

said, we want to look at this Franklin-Hoover -- excuse

11

me -- this Franklin Roosevelt-Hoover election in 1932, I

12

think the Court would have been pretty surprised that

13

that was the best and most relevant information that

14

Congress could come up with.

15

This idea of -- of a badge that really runs

16

with the land is -- is something that we -- we think is

17

inherently unjustifiable.

18

I'd also like to address the point about

19

racial bloc voting.

20

discrimination, and it's not unconstitutional.

21

indeed, the way the Court has interpreted section 2 -

22

and I realize there are divisions in the Court about

23

this -

24
25

Racial bloc voting is not

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And,

The district will -- the

district will never be involved in racial bloc voting
63
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for districting purposes because it doesn't -- it's

2

boundaries don't change.

3

MR. COLEMAN:

That's true, Justice Ginsburg.

4

But in terms of this facial challenge, it is important

5

for the Court to understand and to consider the fact

6

that Congress really thumbed its nose at the Court in

7

terms of rejecting the constitutional concerns that the

8

Court raised in -- in Miller and in Bossier Parish and

9

in Georgia versus Ashcroft.

10

The new enactment has been changed in a way

11

that -- that really requires covered jurisdictions to

12

engage more and more in race-based redistricting and

13

race-based -- and it's not only redistricting, Justice

14

Ginsburg -- in race-based decisionmaking.

15

we are 40 years -

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so here

Why wouldn't one

17

construing the Act as it was passed in 2006, say, well,

18

Congress obviously had in mind that this would be

19

enforced consistent with this Court's decision in Shaw,

20

this Court's decision in Miller?

21

MR. COLEMAN:

We believe that the

22

interpretation of the Act or -- excuse me -- the passage

23

of the amendments in 2006 go far beyond what

24

preclearance was in 1965.

25

form of preclearance that requires State and local

We have a more restrictive

64

governments to engage in more, not less, race-based

decisionmaking with respect to elections.
