ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT J. FORSTER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. FORSTER:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

10

Thank you, Your Honor.

Court:

11

The issue before the Court in this case is

12

whether the discharge provision of 924(c) carries with

13

it some requirement of intent.

14

answer to this question is yes.

15

would cite to the leg -- to the text of the statute

16

itself as well as the history involved, the presumption

17

of mens rea that is inherent in all statutes such as

18

this Court's case law has been clear on as well as the

19

principle of the rule of lenity, if we get to that

20

point, and if the Court deems that there is some type of

21

ambiguity.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We believe that the
And to that end we

Mr. Forster, there are

23

three levels under this:

Possession, brandishing, and

24

if the gun is discharged.

You don't quarrel with the

25

notion that Dean at least brandished this gun?

weapon.

4

We -- we do not dispute that,

No, he clearly intentionally brandished the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So we're talking about a

5

three-year difference between brandishing and if the gun

6

is discharged?

7

MR. FORSTER:

Yes, Your Honor, that's

8

exactly right.

And the statute in 924 requires that the

9

use of the firearm be during and in relation to the

10

underlying crime of violence, which in this case is a

11

bank robbery.

12

the statute would require that the discharge also be

13

done during and in relation to the underlying crime of

14

violence.

15

any sense.

16

And we believe that the proper reading of

Otherwise, the statute simply would not make

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think one of the

17

stronger arguments against you is the use of the passive

18

voice.

19

It says a firearm is discharged.

20

to take it away from the element of intent that you're

21

trying to focus on.

It doesn't say anybody who discharges a firearm.
And that seems to me

22

MR. FORSTER:

Your Honor, I think that it's

23

a transitive verb the way it's used.

24

would have some object.

Someone would have had to have

25

discharged the weapon.

And so I think that the Court's
4

Alderson Reporting Company

By definition it

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cases on mens rea and so forth would continue to apply,

2

even given the way that it's phrased in the statute.

3

don't think -

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you think it's

5

different -- I don't remember the grammar too well.

6

think "if firearm is discharged" is different than

7

"firearm discharges;" is that your point?

8
9

MR. FORSTER:

I

You

I'm not sure it would make a

difference in this case, Your Honor, because I don't

10

think there's any -- I think that by definition the

11

Court would have to ask itself who discharged the

12

weapon.

13

"discharge" in a vacuum.

14

I don't think you can just use the word
It has to be during -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I'm not sure

15

that's right.

16

to flee and the security guard is forced to use his

17

firearm, increasing the danger to everybody else in the

18

bank, I'm not sure this statute wouldn't cover that as

19

well.

20

I mean, if in fact the bank robber tries

MR. FORSTER:

Your Honor, I don't believe

21

the statute would, because the individual who would be

22

charged with it would not himself have "during" or "and

23

in relation to" the underlying crime of violence.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it doesn't say -- it

says, "if the gun is discharged."

And I think on the

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

government's reading it would cover the police officer

2

who is trying to apprehend a robber and fires a gun.

3

MR. FORSTER:

Yes, Your Honor, I think under

4

the government's theory that would be true.

5

that would open up -

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

But I think

What -- what --

7

I guess I'm not following this.

8

true that if the blank -- if the bank guard fires his

9

own gun when -- when the bank robber is fleeing, that

13

would come within this?
MR. FORSTER:
our reading.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

government's either.

17

No, Justice Scalia, not under

Ah, that's different, yes.
That's different.
So it's using the

23

robber's gun, but by the police officer who is

24

apprehending him.

25

government's view, it doesn't matter whether it's the

police officer.

It has to be the gun of the robber, but

2

it doesn't matter whether it's the robber or the police

3

officer who discharges it.

4

MR. FORSTER:

That's true, ma'am.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess it's also the

6

government's view -- this is even weirder -- that it

7

doesn't matter who brandishes the gun.

8

guard grabs the gun and brandishes the gun, and that

9

also gets additional time served for the bank robber.

10
11

The -- the bank

It doesn't seem fair.
MR. FORSTER:

Your Honor, I don't believe

12

that the -- that the hypothetical of the guard waving

13

the gun around, I don't think that would meet the

14

definition of "brandish" the way 924 defines it.

15
16
17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It has very specific -

what are the words that define what is brandishing?
MR. FORSTER:

Justice Ginsburg, "brandish"

18

is defined under the statute a couple of different ways.

19

The -- the dictionary definition of "brandish," which is

20

to grab something and wave it around, is certainly

21

contained in that.

22

But the definition goes further.

23

definition also says that if I, for example, make known

24

that I have a gun, if I pass a note saying I have a gun,

25

that would also be brandishing under the statute.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I -- I didn't think the

2

government or anybody was reading the definition of

3

brandishing to include a police officer.

4

MR. FORSTER:

The way the government's brief

5

-- well, with regards to brandish, Your Honor, I don't

6

know that the government goes that far.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it runs into the

8

problem, which is also a different problem for you, and

9

that is the brandishing must be for the purposes -- for

10

the purpose of intimidating.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.
So that's probably going to

13

eliminate the case in which the officer grabs the

14

felon's gun.

15

creates for you is that "brandish" is specifically

16

defined to have that particular intentional element.

17

There is, however, no definition of -- of the -- of the

18

term in question here, which suggests that they did not

19

have any discharge -- that they did not have any -

20

any -- any intent to impose an intent requirement.

21

they do it, they know how to do it.

22

didn't do it.

23

So the problem that it seems to me that it

MR. FORSTER:

When

In this case they

Your Honor, I would disagree

24

with that simply for this reason.

This Court's case law

25

is clear that if Congress wants to do away with the mens

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rea element, they must affirmatively do so.

2

think that it's proper to say that because there's a

3

specific definition of "brandish," therefore they meant

4

discharge to be basically strict liability.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And I don't

Why is it improper?

6

mean, it may not be conclusive, but it seems to me

7

evidence that points in that direction.

8
9

MR. FORSTER:

I

Your Honor, I think that that

would be disregarding the presumption of mens rea that

10

exists pursuant to this Court's case law as well as the

11

requirement -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We have -- we have lots of

13

cases in which it makes sense to disregard that

14

presumption, and -- and nobody thinks twice about it, I

15

mean, accomplice liability being an example.

16

There are -- there are -- there are lots of

17

State crimes in which it is dispensed with, reckless

18

driving, death resulting.

19

what in effect the rationale is that the -- that the

20

individual who is being charged has created a risk, no

21

one can control that risk, including himself.

22

bears the responsibility for, if you will, bad luck if

23

the risk is realized.

24

for holding him liable for discharge here without any

25

particular knowing or -- or intentional act in making

And in all of those cases

But he

And that is the rationale for -

9

the discharge.
So why doesn't that make sense and why is

3

that not an answer to the usual presumption that there

4

will be a specific state of mind required?

5

MR. FORSTER:

Your Honor, I don't think this

6

statute is driven by consequence.

7

Your Honor's hypothetical -

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

MR. FORSTER:

Why?

And as I understand

Why?

Because the words that the

10

statute uses are directly focused to the -- to the

11

conduct of the defendant:

12

discharge," as opposed to, for example, carjacking.

13

"Possess, use, brandish,

Well, this is conduct.

mean, it isn't just bad luck.

24

25

they -- they allowed for substantially larger sentences

additionally punishable conduct.

MR. FORSTER:

Your Honor, I don't believe a

jury would be -- would make that decision, because under

6

this Court's authority in Harris, that would be for the

7

judge; and -- and obviously criminals would make these

8

claims, and it would be -

9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me?

That would be

for the judge?

11

MR. FORSTER:

Under this Court's authority

12

in Harris, Your Honor, brandish and discharge are not

13

elements of the offense that must be indicted and proved

14

to a jury.

15

if you will, that -- that would be up to the judge, and

16

that's this Court's Harris ruling.

17

They are sentencing elements or enhancement,

JUSTICE ALITO:

Doesn't that undermine your

18

argument that there's a presumption that a mens rea has

19

to apply, because this is just a sentencing element?

20

MR. FORSTER:

Your Honor, I don't believe

21

so.

22

a sentencing enhancement rather than an element of the

23

offense that somehow the statutory rules of construction

24

cease to apply.

25

This Court has never said that merely because it is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't it part of the

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

background here that it was proposed at the time these

2

enhancements came into the law, it was proposed that

3

there be a specific state of mind requirement for the

4

discharge of the gun, and that was not enacted?

5
6
7

MR. FORSTER:

I didn't hear the -- I'm

sorry, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that part of

8

the legislative history was that there were proposals --

9

I mean, there is a rather sharp difference between

10

"possess" -- yes, you have to have a knowledge, intent

11

element -- "brandishing," very clear, for purposes of

12

intimidation -- then "discharge" has no -- it's just

13

that the gun is discharged.

14

Weren't there proposals to include something

15

like what was included for the other two, that is, that

16

there be an intent requirement?

17

MR. FORSTER:

Your Honor, there were various

18

drafts in the House and the Senate that -- that

19

specifically provided the intent requirement.

20

compromise that came out was basically a disagreement

21

over the penalty, and the language that the Congress

22

used, "during and in relation to," necessarily implies

23

some type of an intent element.

24

are clear on that; it has to be knowing, otherwise it's

25

not during and in relation to.

The

I think the circuits

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And so I believe that the choice of language

2

that Congress uses -- there has to be the connection, we

3

believe, between the use -- during in relation to and

4

the discharge.

5

because it wouldn't be triggered by anything.

6

Otherwise the statute makes no sense,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

I can't get anywhere

7

with the language, to tell you the truth.

I could read

8

it either way.

9

The person "discharges," yeah, but what if he discharges

It -- the House language is the same.

10

it accidentally?

Is the accidental case or unintended

11

case meant to be covered or not meant to be covered?

12

MR. FORSTER:

We don't -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

And you don't get anywhere

14

-- I just can't get anywhere with the language.

15

reason they put the "is discharged" is probably for

16

parallelism.

17

and they do their job in a stylistic way.

18

nothing that suggests anything other than that.

19

The

It was a drafting section in the Senate,

So -- so where am I?

I found

Sometimes a person who

20

discharges the weapon accidentally is really much worse

21

than the one who does it purposely.

22

shoots at the ceiling; accidentally, he kills a person

23

dead; okay?

Purposely, he

So I mean, I can't get too far with that.

24

So where -- so there we are.

25

anything else -- there is the post problem that the
14

Chief Justice mentioned.

Is there anything else you can

2

say to me, who really doesn't see it one way or the

3

other way in this statute?

4

MR. FORSTER:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

Your Honor Would you say, look, this

is why you win?

7

MR. FORSTER:

Your Honor, in the committee

8

reports and so forth I think it's pretty clear that they

9

did not intend an unintentional or an accidental

10

discharge to be covered.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why -- why do you think

12

that?

13

is a bank robber and has a gun and has already shown it,

14

and it goes off accidentally is, is -- has caused a

15

tremendous harm in certain cases, which traditionally

16

has been thought meriting a higher sentence.

17

I mean, it is absolutely true that a person who

And it is also true that he doesn't have the

18

same state of mind as the one who does it purposely.

19

That is true, too.

20

should I do?

21

Both are true.

And so now what

I know what you want me to do, but why?

MR. FORSTER:

Your Honor, the requirement -

22

we think that the discharge again must be during and in

23

relation to.

There has to be that connection.

not?

If recklessness were the requirement

3

think this Court's authority in Smith talks about the -

the intent element that is inherent in this.

5

be purposeful, it has -- it cannot be by accident, and

6

that's what this Court -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why?

It has to

You place a lot of

8

reliance on this:

During and in relation to any crime

9

of violence or drug trafficking crime.

But that -

10

that's in the prologue, and it applies only to the

11

matter covered in the prologue -- to wit, "During and in

12

relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking

13

crime, for which the person may be prosecuted in a court

14

of the United States, uses or carries a firearm or in

15

furtherance of any such crime possesses a firearm."

16

That -- that's what all that language

17

"during and relation to" applies to.

18

continues:

19

"in addition to the punishment provided for such crime:"

20

One, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less

21

than five"; two; and number three, what we're dealing

22

with here, "if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced

23

to a term of imprisonment of not less than ten years."

24
25

And then it

"Shall," if that "in relation to" exists,

I don't see how that language during and in
relation to any crime of violence applies to anything,

except the use or carrying of a firearm.

2

MR. FORSTER:

Justice Scalia, sir, we

3

believe that the proper -- that the better reading would

4

be some connection between those two, between the

5

discharge and the underlying, the during and relation

6

to.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why is that?

How could you

8

-- how could you make the lack of connection any clearer

9

than by ending the first, the introduction with a dash,

10

and then putting 1, 2, and 3?

11

that it applies to the portion before the dash.

12

MR. FORSTER:

I mean, it seems to me

Your Honor, if that were the

13

-- if that were the interpretation, then it would lead

14

to what we consider to be some of the absurdities as far

15

as the results go.

16

"during and in relation to" -- I will refer to it as the

17

connection.

18

of different things could occur, and that connection is

19

what makes this statute make sense.

20

If there is no connection between

In absence of that connection, any number

And I believe that the government basically

21

acknowledges that in their brief, that there has to be

22

-- if there's not some connection -- I think it's page

23

24

absurd results that might flow from a statute where

25

there is no such connection, what the government says -

When we discussed the

18
Alderson Reporting Company

I believe it's on page 29 -- is that to avoid these

2

absurd results, this connection does exist.

3

the next sentence they say:

4

is a mens rea.

5

But then

But it doesn't mean there

And it seems to me that what the government

6

wants in that case is the "during and relation to "has

8

yet they don't want Smith to go along with it.

Smith said that during and relation to is purposeful,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think it has

The -- the "use or carry"

So he already is

12

That excludes all your things about years before or

13

years after he carried -- he carried a gun.

one narrows it to the person who uses or carries a gun

And then -- so that's the starting premise.

original question Your Honor asked me, did he

intentionally brandish it?

22

that if -- if this case we are here about is fit into

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me ask you a question

3

about that.

I thought that "or possesses" was separate

4

from the "uses or carries."

5

using or carrying or is it as it says -- "or who in

6

furtherance of such crime possesses"?

7

separate -- separate enhancement?

Is possession an example of

MR. FORSTER:

9

the word "enhancement," Your Honor.

10

Is that a

I don't know that I would use
The principal body

of 924 -

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

12

MR. FORSTER:

Right.

-- "carries" with "uses" as in

13

this case as well as later on in the statute

14

"possesses."

15

So it says both.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why do we have to find that

the phrase "if a firearm is brandished" and the later

phrase "if a firearm is discharged" require intentional

brandishing and intentional discharging?

8

limit it by saying, oh, of course it means if the

9

firearm is brandished by the bank robber or by the felon

10

or if it's discharged by the felon, but leaving it quite

11

undetermined whether it has to be intentionally

12

discharged, or even intentionally brandished for that

13

matter.

14

MR. FORSTER:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why can't we

Well The definition of

16

brandishing, I guess, requires some intent to put

17

another person in fear.

18

MR. FORSTER:

Your Honor, I think that you

19

would then have to turn to this Court's -- well, first

20

of all, I think it's the best reading of the statute.

21

It doesn't make sense any other way to say that you can

22

have the gun discharged but not be during and in

23

relation to the underlying crime of violence.

24

doesn't make sense.

25

Second, I believe that this Court's
22
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statutory rules of construction would say that if

2

Congress wanted to do away with the mens rea element in

3

this case, they would have had to have done so

4

expressly.

5

And we don't believe that they did.
Now, every circuit that has discussed the

6

requirement "during and in relation to" has found a

7

knowledge requirement that you can't not know the gun is

8

there, for example.

9

requirement.

There has to be the knowledge

And this Court's authority in Smith

10

suggests or says clearly that it cannot be used

11

accidentally.

12

So now the question becomes this:

If the

13

Court decides that during -- that the discharge must be

14

during and in relation to, and when the Court does that

15

it takes its own authority in Smith to say that it has

16

to be purposeful, it has to have the effect of the

17

commission of the crime, now is -- would the use in this

18

case be subject to Smith?

19

accidental discharge simply -- or accidental use, rather

20

-- it didn't talk about discharge exactly -- but that

21

accidental use would never be because it -

22

And Smith is clear that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why -- you say that this

23

background -- that there has to be a state of mind

24

element.

25

principle, but here we have a provision that does

And we can accept that that's a general

Alderson Reporting Company

2

of mind for the possession, for the brandishing, intent

to intimidate, but here is this other one that suddenly

4

doesn't.

5

the third one, discharging a gun, they didn't mean to

6

have any element because -- any element of mens rea -

7

because they had it in number 1 and 2, and 3 leaves it

8

out.

9

So wouldn't the text of this statute say -

MR. FORSTER:

Your Honor, if -- I believe

10

such an interpretation would basically mean that that

11

silence would be interpreted as a strict liability, that

12

silence with regards to the specific intent requirement

13

would mean the Congress meant that no intent was

14

necessary.

15

from this Court have held.

16

Congress operates against, and if they wish to eliminate

17

the mens rea element, they must do so expressly.

18

simply do not believe that it -- that it happened in

19

this case.

20

And that's simply never what these cases
There's the presumption that

And we

One last point is, we believe there's

21

nothing else that Congress would have had to have done

22

to establish a general intent, and if that's true, then

23

I think the very least that could be said about our

interpretation is that it would be a reasonable one, in

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the firearm during and in relation to the bank robbery

2

in your hypothetical or possessing it in furtherance of

3

the bank robbery in your hypothetical.

4

If one concluded that because the bank

5

robbery continued, even though he was no longer using or

6

carrying the firearm or no longer possessing it, that

7

the 924(c) offense also continued, and the firearm

8

discharges when he drops it, then, yes, the firearm is

9

discharged while the section 924(c) offense is ongoing,

10

and, yes, the mandatory minimum would apply.

11

But -- but that hypothetical presents

12

questions about the beginning and end of the section

13

924(c) itself, not questions about whether or not the

14

discharge was intentional or accidental.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you think that -

16

regardless of whether it's intentional or accidental, do

17

you think he has to discharge it or that he has to

18

brandish it?

19

anybody discharges it or brandishes it?

20

It is the passive voice.

MS. MAYNARD:

Does it mean if

Two -- at least two points

21

about that, Your Honor.

The passive voice makes clear

22

that Congress cared about the fact of the discharge,

23

that Congress was indifferent as to who discharged the

24

weapon.

25

the passive voice, we think Congress was also

Because the "is brandished" is also stated in

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

indifferent as to who brandished the firearm, although

2

there is a separate provision giving content to what it

3

means to brandish, and brandish must be done in order to

4

intimidate.

5
6

So -- but if a confederate, for example JUSTICE SCALIA:

Grabs it out of his hand

and brandishes it.

7

MS. MAYNARD:

-- and brandishes in order to

8

intimidate the victims in the bank, then yes, both of

9

them would be subject to the brand -- to the brandishing

10

enhancement.

11

in the -- in the sentencing factor, "if the firearm is

12

discharged," applied only to the defendant's conduct,

13

which -- that's not our position, and we think that

14

clearly -- it clearly encompasses others -- ordinary

15

liability rules under Pinkerton and aiding and abetting

16

principles would hold a confederate liable for discharge

17

by another.

18

And even if one thought that the language

19

police officer -- the police officer disarms the robber

20

and ten minutes later mishandles the gun and it goes

21

off.

I mean, he has got the one guy neutralized but the

So then the guy who is captured

MS. MAYNARD:

If the section 924(c) offense

8

is -- is -- is ongoing and if the firearm is discharged,

9

the mandatory minimum sentence applies.

One might

10

conclude that if third parties take the weapon and

11

discharge it -- and, by the way, I do believe these are

12

purely hypotheticals.

13

that's actually been the case -- but -

14

They point to no case where

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, there probably

15

aren't a lot of cases where the bank robbers are such

16

klutzes that they're fumbling with the gun and it goes

17

off, either.

18

MS. MAYNARD:

That's true, there may not be

19

very many accidental discharges.

But there's no reason

20

to believe Congress wanted courts to engage in the

21

inquiry about whether or not the defendant accidentally

22

discharged the weapon.

23

hold that accident -- accidental discharges are not

24

covered by the sentencing factor, I think that we would

see more claims of accidental discharge.

MS. MAYNARD:

MS. MAYNARD:

What do you say to your

opponent's argument -- I don't know if it's right or not

-- but that there's sort of a background rule that

10

generally we assume when Congress prohibits conduct, it

11

means intentional conduct; and normally if they don't

12

mean that, they make it rather clear in the statute.

13
14

Is that a correct -- is his background
principle correct?

15

MS. MAYNARD:

I don't think so, Justice

that really makes all that much difference.

sentencing factors here, the Court note -- noted that -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me -- let me rephrase

the question.

5

MS. MAYNARD:

Yes.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If it were an element of

the crime, would you then agree with his background

8

rule?

9
10

MS. MAYNARD:

No, Your Honor, because if it

were an element -

11

Then the fact that the

sentencing factor is an element really isn't

13

significant.

case for us if it were an element of the crime, but it

16

wouldn't be an element that would be necessary.

But why would it be a

harder case for you?

19

MS. MAYNARD:

Why would it be a harder case

for us?

21

were an element of the crime, then it would be an

22

aggravated offense, and then one could debate whether or

23

24
25

Because if it were a harbor -- hard -- if it

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But in that situation

would there be a background rule that we normally think
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress intends to punish intentional conduct?

2

MS. MAYNARD:

I think there is a background

3

rule with respect to the definition of criminal offenses

4

that Congress intends some mens rea.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you really then are

6

relying on the difference between an element of the

7

crime and a sentencing factor?

8
9

MS. MAYNARD:

Not -- no, Your Honor, not in

this way, because it -- it would -- it would be a more

10

difficult caper -- case for us, I can see, but that you

11

would still be talking about somebody who was engaged in

12

wrongful conduct.

13

There would be no danger.

I mean, one of the reasons the Court assumes

14

a mens rea requirement or reads in a mens rea

15

requirement when one's not there, is because of the fear

16

of capturing innocent conduct; but what you would be

17

talking about is someone who has taken a loaded weapon

to commit a crime of violence or a drug trafficking

caused a death, then he would have committed a more

the assumption that, normally, not always, where you

17

have a criminal statute and the crime has elements, that

18

Congress intends that the elements be carried out with a

19

guilty state of mind; I would start with that

20

assumption.

21

Now I would agree with you that sentencing

22

is different, and the reason that it's different is

23

because sentencing often goes up or down depending upon

24

whether the harm that is foreseen does or does not

25

occur, irrespective of the state of mind.
36
Alderson Reporting Company

So we

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

couldn't apply that normal background rule, in my view.

2

MS. MAYNARD:

I think that's correct, Your

3

Honor, and that's our view.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now -- now, having done

5

that I wonder if the background rule should come into

6

play once again where a mandatory minimum sentence is at

7

stake, for the reason that if the harm eventuates, there

8

are many ways in which the sentence will go up.

9

person had been killed, for example, it becomes a murder

If this

10

in the course of a felony.

There are all kinds of other

11

statutes that can aggravate the felony; and if you don't

12

apply the mandatory minimum, the judge still can give

13

him the higher sentence, if he warrants it.

14

But if you apply the mandatory minimum where

15

the judge wouldn't go up, the only impact that has is to

16

take people who the judge and others think fall into the

17

minimal category of bad behavior plus consequences, and

18

force them to have a higher sentence.

19

be a rationale for a rule of lenity in mandatory minimum

20

sentencing matters.

21

MS. MAYNARD:

Now, that would

But that would be a

22

reconceptualization of the rule of lenity, Justice

23

Breyer.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MS. MAYNARD:

Yes, it would.

It would.

And what, it would be a -- as
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you said for this Court, in Muscarello, the rule of

2

lenity has never been a rule where the defendant always

3

prevails; and it would be an odd notion to have a more

4

muscular rule of the rule of lenity in the sentencing

5

enhancement context than you have with respect to the

6

crime itself.

7

The whole point of having the mandatory

8

minimum is to take away discretion from judges.

What -

9

and the language of the statute here in our view is

10

clear.

11

think it's the present tense that gets you the -- the

12

temporal connection to the crime here.

13

discharged while you are using or carrying it or

14

possessing it, in the offense in the principal

15

paragraph, Congress wanted you to have ten years.

16

It says "if the firearm is discharged," and I

JUSTICE BREYER:

If it is

No, I can't -- I can't -

17

the trouble is I can't find anything in the history of

18

this that really says why they use "is discharged" or

19

used "as opposed to discharges."

20

metaphysical, those arguments, unless I -- I can see

21

either something in the history or some functional

22

consideration.

23

MS. MAYNARD:

And I find those very

Well, in the blue brief they

24

lay out the House's final version, and we have the

25

House's final version in one of our footnotes.
38
Alderson Reporting Company

And then

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they lay out the Senate's final version.

2

And one important distinction, Justice

3

Breyer, between those two versions is that the House's

4

version would have made it active voice, but not only

5

active.

6

that during and in relation to -- discharges, because

7

it's structured different.

But it would have been amenable to the argument

8
9

But the House would have set the penalty for
a discharge at 20 years.

Okay.

That's -- you can infer

10

from that that the House thought an intentional

11

discharge should subject you to 20 years.

12

The Senate's version, which put it in the

13

passive voice, said if the firearm is discharged and set

14

a mandatory minimum of 10 years.

15

infer from that, Justice Breyer, the -- the current

16

structure allows what you're positing, which is more

17

culpable defendants who intend to discharge the firearm

18

to receive a higher sentence.

19

think, that the House thinks that should be 20 years.

20

And I think you can

And one could infer, I

So I think the -- the current structure does

21

allow judges to take into consideration.

It just sets

22

the floor.

23

think they have clearly done that and then to take out

24

of the realm of debate whether or not the defendant

25

intended to discharge the firearm or didn't mean to

And Congress is entitled to do that, and I

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

discharge the firearm.

2

I would like to -- to say one factual point,

3

which is in the -- in the indictment Petitioner actually

4

was charged with use or carrying.

5

could explain, the "use or carry during or in relation

6

to," is one prong, one way in which to commit the

7

principal offense.

8
9

It just seems -- if I

"Possessing in furtherance" is another way
to commit the principal offense.

The "use or carry" is

10

not modified by "possession in furtherance of," and

11

"possess" is not modified by -- by "during or in

12

relation to," which is another reason it makes no sense

13

to -- to trail the "during or in relation to" down to

14

the generally applicable sentencing factors.

15
16
17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there a difference, a

practical difference, between the two formulations?
MS. MAYNARD:

The legislative -- well, the

18

words are actually different; the text is different; and

19

the legislative history suggests that Congress wanted a

20

beefed-up "in relation to" requirement for possession in

21

order to make sure that incidental possession during -

22

you know, incidental possession while one is also

23

committing a crime wasn't captured.

24

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So the "in

What you're saying, to

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

make sure I understand, is that the "in relation to"

2

language modifies both "use" and "possession"?

3

MS. MAYNARD:

No, sir.

The "in relation to"

4

-- the "during or in relation to" modifier modifies only

5

"use or carry."

6

carry" offense, then the government must show that you

7

"used or carried during or in relation to" in the way

8

those words have been given meaning by this Court.

9

If you're charged with possession, the

And if one is charged with a "use or

10

government must show that you possessed the firearm in

11

furtherance of.

12

the "in relation to" prong have been given similar

13

meanings by the courts, although generally it's thought

14

that the "in furtherance of," like I say, is a sort of

15

beefed up "in relation to" requirement because -

16

Now, the -- the "in furtherance of" and

that fall within "carries" or not?

JUSTICE BREYER:

MS. MAYNARD:

He would be carrying -- if I

understood you, he would be carrying.
41
Alderson Reporting Company

And if he was

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

also committing a crime, he would be carrying -- if he

2

was also committing a crime of violence, he would be

3

carrying it during the crime of violence.

4

this Court's decision in Smith, if it were -

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

But under

The carrying has to be -

6

although the statute doesn't say it, Smith says the

7

carrying has to be in relation to the crime.

8

MS. MAYNARD:

9

carrying has to be in relation to -

10
11

The statute does say that

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought it just said "who

in furtherance of any such crime possesses a firearm."

12

MS. MAYNARD:

I am sorry.

13

were asking me a "carry" hypothetical.

14

asking me a "possession" hypothetical -

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought you
If you are

No, it's a "carrying."

My

-- my interest is the -- whoever, blah, blah, blah, for

17

which the person may be prosecuted uses or carries a

firearm, or who in furtherance of any such crime

So I thought that the "in

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MS. MAYNARD:

24
25

sorry.

It doesn't.
Okay.

You are right.

Okay.

I am

I answered JUSTICE BREYER:

So, you know, what happens

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

if the person has the firearm -- he is carrying the

2

firearm in his pocket and doesn't know it?

3

up from the tailor, and now is -- is there an intent

4

requirement there?

Do we know?

5

that?

I mean is there, you know, a state

6

of mind requirement?

Do we know?

7

MS. MAYNARD:

He picked it

Did Smith talk about

It's hard to see how one could

8

meet this Court's definition in Smith for -- for "in

9

relation to," which was to have -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Smith says "in relation to"

11

and so the carrying has to be in relation to.

12

the carrying has to be in relation to, that pretty much

13

--

14

MS. MAYNARD:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

And since

The underlying -- covers the state of

mind.

17

MS. MAYNARD:

The carrying had to be in

18

relation to the underlying drug crime or crime of

19

violence.

20

in Smith to mean have some purpose or effect, facilitate

21

or further the underlying crime, not be by accident or

22

coincidence.

23

This Court gave content to "in relation to"

The gist of Petitioner's argument here is

24

they want to read that "accident or coincidence"

25

language down to modify "discharge."
43
Alderson Reporting Company

And structurally

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that -- that just doesn't work.

2

one more point about why it's clear it isn't that, which

3

is that the -- the "in possession in furtherance of

requirement" -- I mean one of the things they say in

5

response to our argument is that we are willing to put a

temporal limitation on the sentencing factors, but not

Now, do either "in relation

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It could be just walking down the street, you happen to

Secondly, this Court in Harris recognized
that these are the types of sentencing factors that one

JUSTICE STEVENS:

statute includes the word "during."

5

Well, what does -- where

does the "during" come from then?

That means that the "is

Is this factor present?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's

And you say it can't come

17

from the prologue, because if it came from the prologue,

18

it wouldn't apply to the mere possession.

19

MS. MAYNARD:

Exactly.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the possession could be

21

at any time, before the crime, after the crime,

22

whatever.

23

MS. MAYNARD:

Possession -- it would just

24

have to be possession that was in furtherance of an

25

underlying crime.

Once you're guilty of that, if the
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

firearm was discharged while you were guilty of that -

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you have to import some

-- some contemporaneous -- contemporaneous requirement

into the 1, 2, and 3.

MS. MAYNARD:

Some temporal limitation, and

6

the limitation is what -- is that it must be discharged

while you're committing the offense for which you're

8

being sentenced when we're looking at sentencing

9

factors, which is set forth in 924(c).

that the -- the 924(c) offense, which is the possession

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

point -- in other words he was still possessing it in

2

furtherance of the underlying crime of violence, and it

3

discharges -- then, yes, the sentencing factor, by its

4

plain terms, applies.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Then you're telling me

6

that it need not be during as long as it's in

7

8

incorporated implicitly in the sentencing factors.

9

So the "in furtherance of" is also

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, the -- no, the "in

sentencing, Justice Stevens, is not was the discharge in

13

be asking is, were you still possessing the firearm in

furtherance -

You would -- you would -- all you would

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

MS. MAYNARD:

This must be during?

The discharge must be

temporally related to the principal offense, yes,

18

because the discharge is discharged while you're in the

19

course of the principal offense, that's the way these

20

types of sentencing factors -

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think I got everybody

22

mixed up, because the first sentence of the statute is

23

on the preceding page.

24

I would discover -- of my memo -- if -- it says, if -

That's right.

And also -

The provision -- the in

indicated in Harris, the principal offense -- the

principal paragraph sets forth the complete crime, and

14

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, I think it's important

15

to recognize, though, that Congress didn't want to open

the door to claims that -- that the firearm was

discharged accidentally.

Sure, when the

defendant -- and says I didn't really mean to shoot the

I mean, the -- the

fact of a discharge is what Congress is clearly

concerned about, and you can tell that from the text.

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT J. FORSTER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FORSTER:

This Court in U.S. Gypsum was

13

very clear when it said that far more than the simple

14

omission of the appropriate phrase of a statutory

15

definition is necessary to justify dispensing with the

16

intent requirement.

17

And our argument is simply this, merely

18

because this might be a sentencing enhancement rather

19

than an element of the offense, this Court never says

20

that the normal rules of statutory construction cease to

21

apply under those circumstances, which means that the

22

mens rea presumption is appropriate in this case, and

23

just like this Court said in the passage I just cited.

24
25

If Congress wants to dispense with that
requirement, they must do so clearly, and they simply
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

did not do that in this case.

2

that, they could insert the words "intentionally" or

3

"unintentionally discharge," in which case that would be

4

clear.

5

reads.

6
