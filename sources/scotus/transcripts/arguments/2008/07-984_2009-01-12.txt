10

ON BEHALF OF FEDERAL RESPONDENTS,

11

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS

12
13

GENERAL GARRE:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

14

The expert agencies charged by Congress with

15

implementing the Clean Water Act have concluded that the

16

discharge of fill material, like the mine tailings at

17

issue in this case, should be permitted by the Army

18

Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the Act, and are

19

not -- are not subject to the effluent guidelines

20

applicable to permits issued by the EPA under section

21

402 of the Act.

22

That interpretation is grounded on more than

23

three decades of agency pronouncements and reflects the

24

collective judgment and expertise of the Army Corps of

25

Engineers and the EPA in administering the Act.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the discharge comes

2

from a single pipe, is it always one or the other, or

3

can it ever be both fill and -

GENERAL GARRE:

Justice Kennedy, it's always

one or the other.

The Clean Water Act establishes two

permitting regimes.

something where the parties agree.

8

9

pollutants generally but not the discharge of dredged

Either it's going to

10

material, or fill material, which is covered by section

11

404 of the Act.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's a legal

13

answer to Justice Kennedy's question.

physical answer?

What is the

Can a pipe both emit sludge, fill, and

As a practical matter, for

example, if you take the slurry in this case, which is

18

55 percent solid by volume, there is going to be liquid

19

coming out of that pipe with the slurry, but under the

20

definition that the agencies administer of fill

21

material, this is fill material under that definition.

JUSTICE SCALIA:
effluent, in other words?

24
25

Fill material trumps

GENERAL GARRE:
effluent.

Fill material trumps

That's 5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it does -- here's the

2

problem that I am having and I think others may have.

3

We start, number one, with a definition, as I understand

4

it, of a pollutant that includes suspended solids.

5

Number two, there is an existing regulation to the

6

effect that wastewater from this particular method of

7

extracting gold shall simply not be released, shall not

8

be put into a water body.

9

come along and in effect they say by regulation, if the

And then the two agencies

10

suspended solid in effect comes out of a mine, or if the

11

wastewater has got suspended solid in it, we are going

12

to call it "fill" and leave it entirely to the Army

13

Engineers under 404, subject to an EPA veto.

14

And on the face of it, it sounds as though

15

they are simply, number one, defining one -- one variant

16

of pollution out of the EPA's jurisdiction, and, number

17

two, with respect to the wastewater, in effect coming up

18

with a contradictory determination about what should be

19

done with it.

20

And it sounds as though, under the

21

Administrative Procedure Act, that with the statutory

22

and the regulatory regime on the one hand and this joint

23

regulation on the other, you've simply got a flat

24

contradiction, and query whether that can be anything

25

other than arbitrary and capricious under the APA.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Will

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you address that?

2

GENERAL GARRE:

Sure, Justice Souter.

First

3

of all, I those concerns really go to the definition of

4

"fill material," and I don't think that the Respondent

5

SEACC has squarely challenged that definition in this

6

case.

7

And I would point you to two parts of the record.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, let's assume -- and I

8

don't mean to cut you off there, but before you're done

9

-- I am at least raising it because I find it very

10

difficult to get a handle on this case without dealing

11

with that problem.

12

raise it well enough, but I still want you to deal with

13

it on the merits.

14

So you may say, well, they didn't

GENERAL GARRE:

Sure.

And let me just point

15

to the two parts of the record:

16

where the Ninth Circuit acknowledged they didn't

17

challenge it; and also I would point you to the

18

complaint, where the complaint is directed to the

19

permits and does not seek a determination that the Fill

20

Rule definition is arbitrary and capricious.

21

The JA at 541 note 12,

We think that that definition reflects the

22

settled understanding and expertise of both agencies,

23

the Army Corps of Engineers -

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

How could it be settled,

because isn't it a fact that before 2002 if the primary
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

purpose was disposing of waste that the 402 permit

2

applied?

3

GENERAL GARRE:

4

Justice Ginsburg.

5

in 2002.

6

That is correct,

By "settled," I mean it was settled

They adopted this rule.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it's not in 30 years'

7

experience, and when it was disposing of waste, it was

8

under 402 until 2002.

9

GENERAL GARRE:

I think the EPA has always

10

adopted and applied an effects test for determining

11

whether or not a discharge is fill material -

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in fact, was there

13

ever a permit by the Corps of Engineers when the purpose

14

was disposal of waste?

15

rather than a 402, for disposal of what they call

16

"processed wastewater" or "wastewater"?

17

Was there ever a 404 permit,

GENERAL GARRE:

There was a period, of

18

course, Justice Ginsburg -- you are right -- where the

19

Army Corps of Engineers adopted a primary purpose test.

20

During that period -- you are right -- 404 permits were

21

not -- were not issued for the discharge of things where

22

the purpose was not to fill the lake; it was to dispose

23

of material.

24
25

Now, during that period, though, those
discharges were not regulated under section 402 of the
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Act and under Section 306, the effluent guidelines, but

2

for a different reason.

3

weren't regulated under 402 during that period is

4

because of the agencies' wastewater treatment exception,

5

which is found at 40 C.F.R. 122.2, where the agencies

6

excepted from the definition of the "waters of the

7

United States" discharges into an impoundment area.

8
9

The reason why that they

And what you have going on here is the
discharge of fill material into an impoundment area,

10

which is dammed off with a 50-foot dam.

Those

11

discharges, in this case, are governed by section 404 of

12

the Act.

13

into downstream waters of the United States are subject

14

to section 402 of the Act -- there's a separate permit

15

in this case -- and are subject to the effluent

16

guidelines and the new source performance standards.

But any discharges from that impoundment area

17

So you have those two.

The agencies have

18

come together.

They've reconciled the statutory

19

regimes, and they have the 404 permit of dredged

20

material, material that's going to fill the bottom of

21

the lake, raise it by 50 feet, governed by section 404

22

of the Act.

23

and any discharged material out of that impoundment area

24

into waters of the United States is going to be governed

25

by 402 and the separate effluent guidelines there.

That impoundment area then is sealed off,

9
Alderson Reporting Company

That

Official - Subject to Final Review

--

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's pretty cold comfort

3

when you treat as an impoundment area a natural lake.

4

suppose if the -- if it's proper to do what they're

5

doing here, then the lake in the middle of the

6

Everglades is an impoundment area, or a Great Salt Lake

7

is an impoundment area.

8

11
12

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, any -- we're talking

JUSTICE SOUTER:

This is a long way from a

about -

settling pond.
GENERAL GARRE:

Well, let me address that in

13

two different ways:

14

project, when the lake is going to be reclaimed, the

15

agencies determined that it's going to be

16

environmentally as sound, if not superior, for the

17

habitats in Alaska, fish and wildlife.

18

the project, it is going to be -

19

I

First of all, at the end of this

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So at the end of

Yes, but what's that -

20

what's that got to do with the definition of

21

"impoundment area"?

22

treating -- the Corps is treating as an impoundment area

23

a whole natural lake as distinct from a settling basin.

24
25

My problem is that you are

GENERAL GARRE:

The statute refers to

specified disposal sites and what you have here, you are
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

right, is a lake.

2

The other part I wanted to point to is the section 404

3

guidelines are rigorous environmental guidelines that

4

address a number of different concerns, including the

5

quality of the water, the fish and wildlife habitat, and

6

at the end of that process you have got the EPA, which

7

has the right to exercise a veto over -

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

rigorous.

But it's impounded by a 50-foot dam.

You keep saying they are

My understanding is -- and I didn't think it

10

was seriously disputed here -- is that during the period

11

in which the deposits are going to be made, the natural

12

life of this water body is going to be destroyed.

13

GENERAL GARRE:

That's true.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And the Corps comes along

15

and says, oh, when it's all over, it will come back.

16

But when you're destroying the entire living sort of

17

corpus of this lake, it seems to me that it's getting

18

more lenient to say that there are rigorous

19

environmental standards.

20

GENERAL GARRE:

That's true, Justice Souter,

21

but it's important to keep in mind that the reason why

22

the lake -- the fish in the lake are not going to

23

survive is because of the fill effect of the material,

24

not because of any toxics put into the water.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but as I understand it,

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and you correct me if I am wrong here, I thought

2

"suspended solids," I guess is the buzz word for it, is

3

a form of pollution.

4

destroying the fish with one form of pollution rather

5

than another form of pollution.

6

that advances the ball for your side.

7

GENERAL GARRE:

So you're saying, well, we're

And I don't know that

Any time you have fill

8

material going into the waters of the United States -

9

of course, section 404 doesn't apply until you've got

10

fill material going into the waters of the United

11

States.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but this comes back to

13

my initial question.

14

simply, defining what would otherwise be a pollutant,

15

suspended solids discharged into the water, by calling

16

it fill material.

17

subject of -- of discharge regulation right out of the

18

law of the United States by redefining it and saying,

19

oh, it doesn't exist if it's coming out of a mine.

20

You are simply, or the Corps is

And it -- in effect it's defining one

GENERAL GARRE:

I think what the agencies

21

have done to reconcile their definitions is to apply

22

this effects test.

23

the entire lake -

24
25

Now, if Coeur Alaska sought to fill

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But to apply the effects

test, the legal effect, is it not, is to define one form
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of pollution as no longer existent so long as that form

2

of pollution falls within the Corps of Engineers

3

definition of "fill."

4
5

GENERAL GARRE:

I don't think that's

correct.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

GENERAL GARRE:

8

Is that correct?
The legal effect is to

regulate that pollution under section 404.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

General Garre, I don't want

10

to take up your rebuttal time, but what's the

11

environmental alternative to what was done here?

12

GENERAL GARRE:

The primary environmental

13

alternative considered was a dry tailings alternative.

14

And that would be been problematic in two different

15

ways.

16

some 100 acres of wetlands; and two, it would have

17

resulted in enormous stacks of tailings, 100 to 200

18

high, thousands of feet wide, that would actually dwarf

19

the Pentagon and be visible from nearby Berners Bay.

20

One, it would have required the destruction of

Now, the Army Corps of Engineers, the State

21

of Alaska, and the Forest Service determined that the

22

wet tailings option, putting the tailings into a lake,

23

and reclaiming that lake so that it would be

24

environmentally superior, was the preferable option.

25

I do want to emphasize that if this Court
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

has any doubt about the statutory text the regulatory

2

decisions here go back more than 30 years.

3

EPA adopted a rule that said that the discharge of fill

4

material is not regulated under the section 402

5

permitting system.

6

rule, the agency made clear again EPA has never

7

regulated the discharge of fill material under the

8

effluent guidelines.

9

In 1973 the

In 2002, in the preamble to the fill

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Weren't they then

10

thinking of fill material as material that was used

11

either to fill in, to reclaim land, or in a construction

12

project?

13

fill, when what it's doing is providing a disposal place

14

for a mining operation, it's not what one ordinarily

15

thinks of as a filling operation.

16

I mean, to call filling a lake, to call that a

GENERAL GARRE:

Not the Environmental

17

Protection Agency.

The Environmental Protection Agency

18

since the passage of the Clean Water Act has taken the

19

position that discharge that has the effect of changing

20

the bottom elevation of a water is going to be fill.

21

And that makes sense as a practical matter.

22

agencies with 30 years of experience determined that the

23

purpose definition that the Corps had adopted for a

24

period was unworkable, unpredictable and didn't make

25

sense.

The

And I think that if there's any judgment that
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the courts ought to defer to here, it's the judgment of

2

the agencies based on their collective experience as to

3

the proper definition of "fill material."

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's one question that

5

Justice Souter raised and before you sit down I would

6

like to get your answer, and that is, can anything, any

7

water of the United States that the Corps of Engineers

8

decides is appropriate to be used as a disposal place,

9

can any waterway be a settling pond?

number of hypotheticals raised by Respondents here.

18

me address those.

19

environmental process, the EPA does have veto authority.

20

We haven't seen these problems at all in the six years

21

that the fill definition has been in place and I think

22

it's simply untenable to suggest that these standards,

23

which in section 4 require water quality determinations,

24

wildlife, aquatic determination, would result in the

25

sort of environmental harm that Respondents have

But, Justice Ginsburg, there have been a
Let

The section 404 process is a rigorous

15
Alderson Reporting Company

hypothesized, and the prospect of that harm is no basis

2

for this Court to override the statutory scheme that

3

Congress created with two distinct permitting regimes,

4

one for fill material, one for other pollutants, and to

5

override the agency's pronouncements, interpretations

6

for more than 30 years.

7

And the other agency document I wanted to

8

point to is very important.

It's the 2004 mine tailings

9

memorandum, which is contained at JA-141 to 146.

In

10

that memorandum, which is a 2004 memo by the heads of

11

the EPA water divisions, they explain the application of

12

the statutory and the regulatory scheme to these types

13

of discharges, discharges that fill material into the

14

impoundment is going to be subject to 404 and the

15

rigorous process there.

requirements of 402 and that agency interpretation is

this case followed 900 studies, the expenditure of $26

million, an evaluation by the EPA, the Corps of

absolutely terrible.

MR. OLSON:

Cholesterol.

13

All right.

We are going to

think of that pollutant.

And now let's suppose that

15

with the agreement of the Army Corps of Engineers a

16

company takes this pollutant, which is the worst one you

17

could think of, that the EPA would never let you go

18

within 50 feet of it, and they take it, and they fill a

19

lake with it up to the level of 55 feet, or 20 feet, or

20

whatever number of feet.

21

I mean, it just can't be that simply because

22

they poured a lot of it in and it fills up the bottom of

23

the lake that suddenly the EPA can't regulate it any

more.

MR. WALDO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

13

In section 306(e), Congress enacted an

14

unqualified prohibition against operating any new source

6

circumstances, and it doesn't say anything about whether

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

Because that's only a statement

It doesn't say anything about whether a 404

isn't applicable to this situation.

on a misinterpretation of the Clean Water Act.

306 does not have a prefatory clause like that, which

19

strongly suggests that it's not intended to apply there.

20

In other -

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

That

So your position requires us

22

to determine that EPA's interpretation of those, the

23

statutory regime that you are talking about, 306 and

24

402, is contrary to the statute?

25

MR. WALDO:

That the interpretation as it's
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

presented in this case is contrary to the statute.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If EPA were to amend the

3

performance standard to say that it doesn't apply in the

4

situation in which the fill rule applies, would that be

5

a valid regulation?

6

MR. WALDO:

Well, I doubt that EPA could -

7

could lawfully under the Clean Water Act enact such a

8

thing, because the Clean Water Act requires EPA to

9

regulate suspended solids and EPA has always regulated

10

suspended solids through effluent limitations.

in a lake, because I want to fill the lake, of what

4

possible application is the fill standard unless it

5

permits what would otherwise be prohibited under -

under the earlier sections?

the authority under section 404 to grant fill material

effluent standards.

13

Even though it violates

MR. WALDO:

No, not when it violates

effluent standards.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you say -- you say that

if you discharge sand into -- into a river it violates

16

effluent standards.

17

MR. WALDO:

Oh, that doesn't -- oh, I'm

18

sorry.

I didn't understand that part of your question.

19

Yes, if -- if there is an effluent limitation for a

20

particular source -- remember, effluent limitations are

21

adopted for industrial sources, so you would have to

22

look at what the source of that discharge was.

23

And if EPA had identified that source, a

24

particular kind of factory of some kind, a mill, you

25

know, a leather tanning facility or something like that,
30
Alderson Reporting Company

if EPA had adopted effluent limitations that were

applicable to that source, then discharges have to

comply with those effluent limitations.

It's important to realize here that the

My question is, does

it apply to solids?

Absolutely.

EPA is required in

20

the Clean Water Act to regulate suspended solids through

effluent limitations.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I guess, I

23

mean, does suspended solids mean there is some liquid

24

involved?

25

MR. WALDO:

That implies some liquid, right;
31

By volume it is 30

percent solids.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is there a point at

which it's proper to speak of it as a solid rather than

I mean, 90 percent by weight or by

MR. WALDO:

Well, the standard in this case

13

prohibits a discharge of processed wastewater.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. WALDO:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

Right.

And so, it You wouldn't think

something that's 90 percent solid is wastewater?

18

MR. WALDO:

There might be some point at

19

which the liquid content of a solid waste is so small

20

that EPA wouldn't regard it as processed wastewater

21

anymore.

22

there is no dispute that the discharge is processed

23

wastewater.

But that's not the case here.

In this case,

The government has conceded that point.

24

And -- and it's extremely important, because

25

EPA is required to, as I said, regulate suspended solids

through effluent limitations and to adopt a zero CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if they were just

3

putting whatever it is that doesn't have any water,

be just the Corps of Engineers through the fill -- fill

provisions that would govern that?

7

MR. WALDO:

8
9

As long as there is no effluent

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERT:

EPA Either way, I guess

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

your friends on the other side would argue, I assume,

2

that it's properly regarded as fill material, because

3

that is the effect of it, rather than as effluent

4

subject to 402.

5

MR. WALDO:

EPA has always regulated

6

industrial sources that -- whose raw processed

7

wastewater contains high levels of suspended solids,

8

high enough that it would have the effect of fill

9

material and can be considered fill.

In fact -- and, in

10

fact, EPA has always had a definition of fill material

11

that was based on the effects.

12

So for more than 30 years, EPA has been

13

regulating sources like ore processing mills, cement

14

manufacturing plants, aluminum smelters, coal-fired

15

power plants, all of which and many more require the use

16

of settling ponds to remove the solids.

decide this case on the assumption that this is fill?

It's fill material

21

and it's processed wastewater that is subject to an

14

a 402 and a 404 permit?

15

MR. WALDO:

No.

In this case there can't be

MR. WALDO:

If there is an effluent

because the Corps of Engineers just doesn't have the

The effluent limitations require the use of

The other solution we were told would

MR. WALDO:

Yes, it has -- it does have

8

adverse impacts, that is, some; but in EPA's view and in

9

our view is not as bad as filling up a lake and killing

10
11
12

all the fish and aquatic life in the lake.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All the fish, there

are a thousand fish in this lake, right?

13

MR. WALDO:

else, right?

17

MR. WALDO:

That's right.

But it's -- it's

18

also an important point for us here that this is a

19

national rule, and EPA considered these kind of

20

alternative land use requirements as an effect of its

21

no-discharge rule.

22

addressed the fact that if you prohibit discharges of

23

processed wastewater into navigable waters, it's going

to require using more land to dispose of all that solid

case, it's fill material, but this fill material is not

15

eligible for a 404 permit.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

404 material is material

17

such that it is fill material and there is no effluent

18

standard applicable?

19

MR. WALDO:

Yes, that's correct.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

And -

So, it's 95 percent solid,

21

but there's an effluent limitation, and your position is

22

that there can't be a 404 permit; it has to be a 402

23

permit?

24
25

MR. WALDO:

If it's covered -- if that

discharge is covered by an effluent limitation, yes,
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

that's correct.

2

point, that EPA -- well, I guess my time is up.

3
4

And I want to be clear about this

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Go ahead.

Finish

your thought.

5

MR. WALDO:

Okay.

EPA amended its

6

regulations in 1979 specifically to recognize the fact

7

that some discharges of fill material are not eligible

8

for section 404 permits and require NPDES permits.

9

that time, the regulations said you don't need an NPDES

At

10

permit if it's fill material.

11

regulation to say you don't need an NPDES permit if it's

12

fill material and it's subject to section 404 of the

13

Clean Water Act.

14
15

EPA amended that

And the purpose of that -

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. OLSON:

What the Respondents would wish

22

to do is to have this Court disagree with the agencies'

23

interpretation of the statutes which they administer,

24

their consistent interpretations of those statutes, and

25

the factual findings that a whole slew of agencies made
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

with respect to the subject matter of these permits.

2

The preamble of the 202 -- the 2002 fill

3

regulations specifically says -- this is 31,135 of

4

Federal Register Volume 67 -- EPA has never sought to

5

regulate fill material under effluent guidelines.

6

Never.

7

There was an agreement, a memorandum of

8

agreement between EPA and the Corps of Engineers in

9

1986.

It is cited at the United States Government brief

10

at page 27.

11

in response to your question, Justice Breyer, and I

12

think something Justice Kennedy said and something

13

Justice Souter said with respect to what if there are

14

two things in the stream going into the water.

15

material remains subject to 404 permitting even if they

16

occur in association with discharges meeting 402

17

criteria.

18

-- and the EPA -

19

The EPA and the Corps agree -- and this is

That's the answer to that question.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

your brother would say:

21

306 effluent.

22

MR. OLSON:

Fill

And the

But I thought -- I thought

But that does not respond to

306 provisions in the statute

23

are not made applicable to 404 permitting, and the

24

consistent regulatory history from 1973 -- and it's all

25

set out on page 27, or summarized on page 27 of the
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

government's brief -- are that 301 and 306 are not

2

applicable under the 404 process.

3

And if there was any doubt at all, there is

4

a -- the so-called mine tailings memorandum at pages 141

5

through 145 of the joint appendix in which three top

6

officials of the EPA construe what they call the rules,

7

the regulations, and the statute.

8

agencies.

9

rule -- this is page 145a -- under the plain language of

This is both

Under the plain regulation language of the

10

the rule and the agency's interpretation of the

11

regulation in its preamble, the mine tailings that are

12

to be placed into an impoundment are covered by 404.

13

And it specifically addresses this -

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why does that mean anything

15

more than you've got to get a 404 permit without

16

addressing the question whether you can get a 404 permit

17

if it has, in effect, the -- the -- if it has the

18

effects which are supposed to be regulated by the

19

effluent limitations?

20

MR. OLSON:

That precise question,

21

Justice Souter, is addressed on pages 143, 144, and 145

22

of this memorandum from top officials of the EPA,

23

applicable to this particular mine and these particular

24

discharges -

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Where is -- where is that

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in the appendix?

2

MR. OLSON:

3

of the joint appendix.

4

That's on pages 141 through 145a

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But as I read that

5

sentence, Mr. Olson, it says they are subject to both

6

permitting.

7

MR. OLSON:

No, it doesn't.

It says -- with

8

due respect, Justice Stevens, it says on the bottom of

9

page 144:

"As a result, the regulatory regime

10

applicable to the discharges under section 402," and so

11

forth.

12
13

What -- I think one thing that JUSTICE STEVENS:

You are talking about the

last sentence on -

14

MR. OLSON:

There is a 402 permit in this

15

case, too there is a 404 permit with respect to material

16

going into the lake and a 402 permit for the material

17

coming out of the lake into the waters of the United

18

States.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
Olson.

Thank you, Mr.
