ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LAMKEN:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Medicare Act provides a special mechanism

12

for judicial review in section 405(d).

13

governs this case is that claims that can be raised

14

through that judicial review procedure must be.

15

The principle that

Section 405(h) bars efforts to circumvent that

16

procedure by singling out particular legal issues and

17

seeking judicial resolution before the Secretary applies

18

those rules to the claimant in a final decision.

1

conclusion flows from the text of the statute and this

20

Court's decisions in Weinburger v. Salfi, Heckler v.

21

Ringer, and Bowen v. Michigan Academy.

22

That

Under the Medicare Act, nursing homes that meet

23

the Secretary's minimum health and safety requirements may

24

voluntarily enter into contracts with the Secretary to

25

provide services to medicare beneficiaries.

The Medicare

1

Act makes the same mechanisms for administrative and then

2

judicial review that are applicable to beneficiaries also

3

applicable to nursing homes that have or seek to enter

4

into those contracts.
In particular, section 1395cc(h) provides that

5
6

any nursing facility that is dissatisfied with the

7

determination, that does not meet the minimum health and

8

safety requirements, and is subjected to a remedy as a

9

result, is entitled to, first, a hearing before the

10

Secretary under section 405(b) and, second, to judicial

11

review of the Secretary's final decision following that

12

hearing.

QUESTION:

MR. LAMKEN:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Mr. Lamken, I guess what respondents

Yes, that's correct, and -And is that possible, in your view,

under this scheme?
MR. LAMKEN:

No, Your Honor, it is not.

The

19

structure of the scheme in section 405(h) specifically

20

exclude preenforcement review.

21

language of section 405(h) in particular, the third

22

sentence of which says that no action against the United

23

States, the Secretary, or any employee shall be brought

24

under the general Federal question statute, which is

25

section 1331, to recover on a claim arising under the

QUESTION:

2
3

nursing homes have to wait for a deficiency citation?

4
5

And so what -- in your view, the

MR. LAMKEN:

That's precisely correct, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

6

But if they then try to raise

7

administratively some constitutional claim, for example,

8

about the regulations, that can't be decided
administratively before the level of the Secretary,

10

I

assume.
MR. LAMKEN:

11

That's correct.

As the Court noted

12

in Weinburger v. Salfi, the Secretary typically will not

13

address constitutional claims in the administrative

14

proceedings, but in Salfi itself there was a facial

15

constitutional challenge to a provision of the statute.

16

Accordingly -- but the Court nonetheless held that even

17

constitutional claims,

18

the statute, must be channeled through the specific review

1

mechanism provided by the act, and that the party could

20

not bypass that mechanism by seeking a declaratory

21

judgment under the general Federal question statute in

22

advance.

23

QUESTION:

facial constitutional challenges to

Mr. Lamken, assume for the sake of

24

argument that I don't agree with you that the text of the

25

statute, the text of the sentence that you referred to,

is

1

dispositive,

so that there would be some, at least

2

practical point to this question.
The question is this.

3

Is it possible for a

4

provider who wants to challenge the regs as vague or

5

beyond legal authority or what-not to carry that challenge

6

all the way through to the point where they could be

7

heard,

8

level for that matter, this Court, without risking the

i.e. to the district court and court of appeals

possibility that if the provider loses, the provider would
10

be terminated, or subject to termination by the Secretary

11

as a provider.
Is it possible,

12

in other words, to challenge the

13

regulations without at the same time assuming liability

14

for the most draconian of possible results, which is

15

exclusion from the provider scheme?

16

MR. LAMKEN:

The answer is yes, although we

17

don't believe that this case presents that type of

18

problem.

1

QUESTION:

20

MR. LAMKEN:

I realize.
And although the Secretary

21

ordinarily would not impose termination or expose medicare

22

providers to extreme risks, because it's a voluntary

23

program, they don't have to --

MR. LAMKEN:

2

QUESTION:

Correct.
-- the Secretary may, the Secretary

3

may not.

Is there a way for this kind of challenge to be

4

made without risk that the Secretary may?
MR. LAMKEN:

5

Termination is an extreme remedy

6

that is reserved for the most extreme circumstances and

7

violations.

8

the statute is, the Secretary or the surveyors issue a

9

letter which specifies the remedies that will be imposed

What normally occurs when a provider violates

10

on a time schedule, including denial of payments after --

11

if the remedy is --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. LAMKEN:

14

QUESTION:

All right.

May I interrupt you --

Yes.
-- there just for a second?

I take

15

it from what you're saying that the Secretary could right

16

up front say, one of the remedies that I'm going to

17

impose,

18

termination.

19

front, would the Secretary be foreclosed from terminating

20

at the end of the process if the provider lost?

21

if you lose at the end of this process,

Now, if the Secretary did not say that up­

MR. LAMKEN:

23

QUESTION:

I don't believe so, Your Honor, no,

So the risk would always be there.

24

Any provider would know, whatever the odds might be, that

1

provider in effect could be eliminated from the benefit,

2

or the administrative scheme entirely.

3

MR. LAMKEN:

It's true that the absence of

4

declaratory relief does subject them to some risk, but it

5

is not the case that there is an extreme risk of

6

termination for a provider that actually does nothing more

7

than preserve his right to appeal.

8

QUESTION:
MR. LAMKEN:

But there is some risk.
I could not -- I -- we would

10

consider it a -- the -- an abuse of the Secretary's

11

decision to terminate a provider for doing no more than

12

necessary to preserve its right to appeal.

13

provider ordinarily would do would be --

QUESTION:

15

MR. LAMKEN:

What the

No, but we -- I think --- to violate the statute, draw

16

some remedy, and then the Secretary -- and then it would

17

come into compliance following that and dispute only the

18

remedy, and if a provider comes into compliance shortly

1

after the remedy is imposed, it ordinarily would not be

20

terminated.

21

QUESTION:

Okay, but one of the provider's

22

arguments is that the risks can be so extreme that there

23

really isn't a proper challenge scheme on your view of the

24

law, because any provider is going to knuckle under rather

25

than take the risk of being terminated at the end of the

day.
And so the -- I think your colleague on the

3

other side would say, well, sure, we may commit a

4

compliance before the end of the day, but the reason we

5

might commit a compliance is that the risk of losing is

6

not merely the risk of losing a legal challenge, but the

7

risk of losing our provider status entirely, and that,

8

fact, they're saying is not a legitimate appeal mechanism,

9

and it ought to influence the way we read this statute.

10

MR. LAMKEN:

In fact, Your Honor, we believe

11

that that risk has been overstated in the way the

12

Secretary implements it.

13

to risk termination in order to bring their challenges,

14

but this is about --

Mr. Lamken, as I read Judge

16

Easterbrook's opinion, he essentially agreed with what

17

you're saying now, but he put it on a ripeness point.

18

said, these regulations are brand new.

19

they're going to be applied.

20

Secretary will do, and we don't know whether a court might

21

say, at the end of the line, that what the Secretary -- he

said they need fleshing out.

1

here because of the ripeness question, that the

2

regulations have been untried, untested.

3

MR. LAMKEN:

I think that's correct.

I think

4

Judge Easterbrook concluded that some of the claims were

5

unripe for that reason.

6

that any of the regulations will ultimately be applied,

7

these are merely enforcement regulations that are being

8

challenged, not anything that's -- requires the providers

9

to change their behavior immediately.

10

QUESTION:

In fact, because it's not clear

But there is something to the point

11

that the Seventh Circuit made that Michigan Academy, that

12

what you are essentially asking the Court to do is to

13

declare Michigan Academy passe because part B regulations

14

are now subject to judicial -- part B rulings are subject

15

to judicial review.

16

Academy never would have been decided the way it was.

If that had been the case, Michigan

But that's what the Seventh Circuit said, that

Michigan Academy stands in the way of cutting out

altogether preenforcement review.

20

MR. LAMKEN:

I -- Michigan Academy we don't

21

believe is passe in the sense that for the category of

22

claims that Michigan Academy identified, claims that could

23

not be raised through the express judicial mechanism, but

24

for which Congress did not express a clear and unambiguous

25

intent to preclude the review altogether, that remains

good law, and that remains applicable to cases that fall

2

into that category.
What Congress did when it restructured the act

is, it took one particular set of claims out of that

category, and those claims were challenges to the

6

methodology used in determining the amount of part B -QUESTION:

7
8

Oh, but I didn't understand Michigan

Academy to be written that way, that, you know, there is
preenforcement review with respect to those claims that

10

can't be challenged otherwise, although there may not be

11

with respect to claims that can be challenged otherwise.

12

I mean, I think we were interpreting 405(h) and 13 5ii,

13

and we said -- we said there is no pre -- there is

14

preenforcement review.

15

MR. LAMKEN:

No -Now you're telling us that there

isn't.

QUESTION:

20

change in either the language of 405(h) or the language of

21

22

MR. LAMKEN:

That construction, Your Honor,

23

would place Michigan Academy in direct conflict with

24

specifically held that an individual may not slice off one

individual issue bearing on -- one individual legal issue

and seek its resolution in advance.
What the Court did in Michigan Academy was, it

3
4

distinguished Ringer by saying -- noting the respondent's

5

argument that it's possible to construe section 405(h) as

6

not applying for those claims that can't be raised under

7

its neighbor, section 405(g).

8

QUESTION:

Well, in particular, these claims.

MR. LAMKEN:

In particular, the claims that were

10

at issue there under the statute as it then existed, but

11

when Congress went and restructured the statute, it took

12

certain -- the claims that were at issue there and --

13

QUESTION:

It's an interesting question of

14

statutory construction.

15

Academy was interpreted a certain way and, it said, there

16

is review.

The review provision in Michigan

17

Now, you're telling us that without any

18

modification of that section, just because another section

1

has now been altered to allow judicial review in some

20

other fashion, the section now has a different meaning.

21

MR. LAMKEN:

No, Your Honor, we don't believe

22

its meaning's changed.

The only ambiguity the Court noted

23

in section 405(h), without discussing the language, the

24

only possible ambiguity it noted was the possibility that

25

it might only preclude review for those claims that can be

raised under section 405(g).
If that's the holding of the Michigan Academy,

2

3

and that is the only ambiguity, or only aspect of the

4

language in 405(h) it addressed -QUESTION:

5
6

Now, is that the -- you contend

that's the holding of Michigan Academy?

7

MR. LAMKEN:

To the extent Michigan Academy

8

addresses the language of section 405(h), that is the only

9

potential ambiguity identified.
QUESTION:

10

Where does it say that?

Where does

11

it say that -- I mean, I understand that that was its

12

rationale for the interpretation of the section, but does

13

it say in so many words that the section only permits

14

judicial review where there is no other review available?

15

MR. LAMKEN:

It does not actually hold that that

16

is the language of the statute, but what it does is, it

17

first says -- there's two possible interpretations that

18

are posited to us.

19

so clear that it bars review altogether, and respondent's

20

view, which -- and I'm going to quote -- which the

21

Congress' purpose was to make clear that whatever specific

22

procedures it provided for judicial review of final action

23

by the Secretary were exclusive, and could not be

24

circumvented by resort to the general jurisdiction of the

25

courts.

The Government's position, that it's

1

The Court then went on and said, whichever may­

2

be the Ringer -- better reading of Ringer and Salfi, we

3

need not pass on the meaning of 405(h) in the abstract.

4

We're not going to address the language.

5

does not apply by its terms to part B of the program, and

6

the legislative history -- and then it went into the

7

legislative history, showing that Congress did not have a

8

clear and unambiguous intent to exclude judicial review

9

altogether.

10

QUESTION:

Section 405(h)

But the first part of what you read

11

referred to review in an administrative agency, I think,

12

and there is no such review in this case.

13

MR. LAMKEN:

Your Honor, the way the structure,

14

the statute is structured is that all claims are channeled

15

through a review in the administrative agency.

16

QUESTION:

Well, all claims -- all of these

17

cases really turn on the meaning of the words, to recover

18

on any claim arising under this subchapter within the

19

meaning of 405(h), don't they?

20

MR. LAMKEN:

21

22

That's correct, they do turn on

that, and in fact -QUESTION:

Some have been held to be such

claims, and some have not been.

Those that have been held

24

to be such claims are all claims that could have been

MR. LAMKEN:

-- constitutional challenge to the

statute, and they sought pure declarative relief in the

14

abstract as an alternative remedy, could not be decided by

15

the Secretary.

It was identical to this claim.

16

Heckler v. Ringer, there was a challenge to the

17

Secretary's rule, that it was promulgated in violation of

18

the APA, and that the rule was invalid.

19

not something that an ALJ could address, yet this Court

20

held that that challenge had to be channeled through the

challenged on judicial review of the administrative

it in Ringer and Salfi, any claim that can be raised

In Michigan Academy, this Court recognized in

Exhaustion means, you give the Secretary a

And then, having done that, they bring the

As an initial matter, that's one

statute -- as Heckler v. Ringer points out, this is not

5

merely a provision that requires exhaustion.
QUESTION:

6

That's the only

But then you've made -- you've turned

7

it into a ripeness statute, whereas Ringer and Salfi and

Bowen and everyone else have considered it an exhaustion
statute, and Easterbrook and everybody say, we're not

10

discussing ripeness, and so what I'm thinking is, suppose

11

it really is ripe, it's really ripe.
What you happen to have are cases where maybe it

12

13

isn't ripe, but suppose it really were?

14

MR. LAMKEN:

Even where it's ripe, the way

15

the -- because of the enormous size of the administrative

16

program and the enormous number of potential legal issues

17

it could raise, Congress established a system where all

18

challenges, the challenges of beneficiaries and the

1

challenges of medicare providers who voluntarily contract

20

to the Secretary, are channeled through what is in essence

21

a quasi-adjudicative system, and as -- you get a final

22

decision of the Secretary, and that is how you challenge

23

the rule, is by challenging the final decision of the

24

Secretary.

2

ripe claim, and the Court said you couldn't do it under

3

1331, even though it's clear that the Secretary cannot

rule on the only issue in dispute.

MR. LAMKEN:

That's correct.

It would -- if it

were a ripeness statute, it would be contrary to Salfi;

8

9

This Court held that the only way the claim could be

10
11

It was a clear procedural

raised was under section 405(g).
Now, it said that you could get -- you could

12

determine the Secretary's denial of predeprivation review

13

was a final decision, and you could immediately go and get

14

review in the courts, but it said the only mechanism for

15

review, even though it was purely procedural and clearly

ripe, was under 405(g) itself.

17

So Salfi didn't involve this issue.

Salfi -- the person whom they permitted to proceed in

MR. LAMKEN:

MR. LAMKEN:

Why is that, or did I

No, that's correct.
What's the reason for that?
As the Secretary implements the

Yes.

Only in the context of a specific

that, Your Honor, I should point out.

4

There would be two opportunities to do

The first is, if the person immediately -- if

5

the facility immediately corrected, and the Secretary

said, because you immediately corrected I'm not going to

impose a remedy but I'm going to deny you a hearing, the

provider could say, no, because you've put me to this

choice that I had to correct, you coerced me to correct,

10

you have to give me a hearing even though there's no

remedy, the Constitution requires it, that claim could be

12

raised under 405(g) and, in fact, that claim has been

13

raised under 405(g) by several providers.

QUESTION:

Well, as to that part of your prong,

then the only way he can avoid -- the provider can avoid

the risk is to comply.

MR. LAMKEN:

No, that's not correct, for two --

it was clear that to recover meant to get money, because

16

that was the only thing at issue, was merely social

security benefits.

But as incorporated into the Medicare Act, it's

clear that to recover does not mean to get money, because

It is challenging the Secretary's enforcement of

the requirements of participation.

The Secretary cannot

pay, and cannot allow its members to participate in this

program, unless they meet the requirements of

participation.

And so what they've done is, they've singled out

the requirements of participation and said, these are

potential legal barriers to our being paid and to our

You then look over on the preceding page, which

12

we see on page 14a of the appendix.

13

(b)(2) the determination there specified is a

determination that the Secretary has refused to renew a

15

provider agreement, or has terminated a provider agreement

16

for one of the reasons set forth in (2)(A),

17

We see that under

(B), or (C).

That statutory language we believe indicates

18

clearly that for an individual provider to assert the kind

19

of constitutional challenge here, we have to basically

20

fall on a sword, subject ourselves to termination or

21

extinction, let our patients be displaced, and then

22

subject ourselves to an administrative process that --

QUESTION:

2

It's not just that you're exposed to

it.

What you're saying is, there has to actually be a

termination or a refusal to renew.
MR. ANDERSON:

5

Is that your --

That is our only route to a

6

405(g) court, which the Secretary argues is our adequate

7

remedy, and I think we also have to look at the

8

administrative process that the Secretary would urge we

9

have to be channeled through.
It is the bizarre -- would be -- it's the most

10
11

bizarre administrative review process, where the critical

12

factual issues are not heard, the issues in the case are

13

not narrowed, the adjudicator cannot hear or adjudicate

14

your claim, and where the adjudicator has no particular

15

expertise in your claim, and then on --

QUESTION:

Mr. Anderson, on this argument, the

17

Seventh Circuit said, well, we don't know about any of

that.

19

no idea how they're going to be applied and interpreted.

20

These regulations are hot off the press.

We have

So what you're describing is something that may

21

be, but maybe not, and my question to you is, is there

22

really a significant difference between the Seventh

23

Circuit's bottom line -- that is, your vagueness

24

challenge, your not-possible-to-administer-equally

25

challenge -- that they wouldn't hear any of those claims

Is the bottom line significantly different?

3

What do you get from the Seventh Circuit decision, apart

4

from the manual, that would be different if the Government

5

had prevailed?
MR. ANDERSON:

6

Well, I think the Government's

7

position is, first of all, these kinds of constitutional

8

claims can never be brought by a trade association, so we

9

would get, under the Seventh Circuit's view, the benefits,

10

the resources -QUESTION:

11

But your members could, and you could

12

join your -- you could then intervene, so that's not a

13

large --

14

MR. ANDERSON:

Well, even the -- even our

15

members cannot individually bring this claim, because this

16

claim is not a claim for benefits, it's not a provider

17

reimbursement claim, it is just a wholly untethered --

18

QUESTION:

But how, then, does an association

19

get the right -- I thought associational standing depended

20

upon the right of at least one member.

21

MR. ANDERSON:

Well, I think it depends on the

22

fact that at least one member has been injured and has a

23

ripe claim, and I think the Seventh Circuit said at very

24

least our APA claim challenging the fact that the

2

But I thought one of your answers to

3

Justice Ginsburg's question was that your members could

4

not have -- no individual member could have brought this

claim.

6

Was I wrong in thinking that?
MR. ANDERSON:

No, I'm saying that the

7

Secretary's administrative review scheme does not allow

8

this kind -- there's not a mechanism for us to bring this

9

claim before the Secretary.

That's why we believe we can

10

bring it directly to the district courts under 28 U.S.C.

11

section 1331 --

12

QUESTION:

But that isn't responsive to -- my

13

question is that the Seventh Circuit said, we're not going

14

to throw you out because you sued under 1331, but we're

15

not going to listen to your claim about vagueness, we're

16

not going to listen to your claim predicting inconsistent

17

application, because we don't know how these things are

18

going to work.

19

MR. ANDERSON:

Well, I think what the Seventh

20

Circuit said, that the APA claim was ripe, and that our

21

claim that the regulations effect a deprivation of rights

22

without a proper hearing of the timing and type demanded

23

by the Constitution may or may not be ripe, and remanded

wait until the agency has worked through the process in

what you're complaining about you could not bring before

the court now on ripeness grounds.

7

MR. ANDERSON:

That sounds like most of

Well, the -- here's what the

8

court actually said.

It said, to the extent the council

9

believes that the regulations fail to provide

10

predeprivation hearings at the time and in the form the

11

Constitution demands, the claim may be ripe for decision.

12

They go on to say that they're going to leave it

13

to the district court for the resolution of that ripeness

14

issue, and then they go on to say that under any

15

circumstance the APA-based objection to the adoption of

16

the manual is within the district court's jurisdiction and

17

should be addressed on the merits.

QUESTION:

That was the only claim that they

said was ripe?

MR. ANDERSON:

QUESTION:

As a matter of law, yes.

They didn't say -- they said may,

MR. ANDERSON:

QUESTION:

4

Well --

What are we supposed to do, assume

that you have a ripe claim and then decide hypothetically?
MR. ANDERSON:

5

Well, certiorari was not granted

6

on the ripeness issue, but I think that we clearly do have

7

a ripe claim as to the APA objection, and as to the

8

remainder I think the Seventh Circuit is correct that it

9

should be left to the district court to determine whether

10

or not ripeness -QUESTION:

11

So if you assume it's a ripe claim,

12

and you do have the language you just quoted at the

13

beginning of your argument, that language seems to say,

14

well, we're sorry, this is an antipreenforcement review

what it says.

I think that's correct, but I

They said it

MR. ANDERSON:

talking about that third sentence of section 405(h).

QUESTION:

What you refer to as your APA claim,

2

to be clear on what that was, was that the manual -- you

3

contended that the manual required notice and comment, and

4

there had been no notice and comment, so that was a

discrete, concrete issue.

MR. ANDERSON:

QUESTION:

8

That's correct.

Unlike your prediction of how these

hearings would work.
MR. ANDERSON:

That's correct.

There's two

10

pieces, but let's take the APA claim for a moment, and

11

let's say we have to channel that through the

12

administrative exhaustion mechanism of section 405(b).

Now we're presenting a claim, an attack on the

14

validity of the Secretary's rulemaking.

it to an adjudicator who has no expertise in the area, is

16

barred by the Secretary's instructions from hearing or

2

substantive challenges to the regulations that are the

3

real problem, so it seems to me that perhaps one could

split off the notice and comment claim from the rest of

the things, and I'm sure that wouldn't please you.
MR. ANDERSON:

6

It's the

No, it wouldn't please me, and I

don't think it would be -- I don't think that it would be

8

justified under the statutory language.

9

congressional intent to split off those kinds of claims,

I don't see any

10

and I think that the legislative history and the statutory

11

structure has already been reviewed -QUESTION:

12

But when you rely on the notice and

13

comment claim, you're putting the administrative procedure

14

in its least appealing light, it seems to me.

15

certainly I thought the Seventh Circuit said we just don't

16

know how the review procedure will go, because these

17

things are brand new, on the substantive claims.

MR. ANDERSON:

I mean,

Well, let me talk about challenge

19

to the regulations for a moment, because that seems to be

20

a concern.

21

we were challenging in part because they preclude even

administrative review of significant, potentially harmful

2

administrative review of the Government's choice of

3

remedy, so you get -- you can get terminated, or you can

4

get fined, or you could have State monitoring.

5

You have no latitude or permission by the

6

Secretary to challenge the choice of remedy, and there is

7

no administrative review regarding the determinations

8

regarding the level of noncompliance.

We say that these

regulations are beyond the Secretary's statutory
10

authority, and are also unconstitutional.

11

Now let's say we are --

12

QUESTION:

How could they be unconstitutional?

13

I mean, your client is free to run the nursing home and

14

give up the Federal support.

15

MR. ANDERSON:

Well, that's an interesting

16

constitutional question of whether the Secretary can allow

17

us to participate and then inflict reputational injury,

18

which I'll talk about in a moment, and other harm without

1

a predeprivational hearing.

20

One of the reputational harms we allege is the

fact that these determinations, which I've outlined here,

you fall on a sword, have to be published.

The Secretary's agents are allowed to

3

characterize the institution as a poor performing-

facility, or a deficient facility, and we have alleged

5

that these kinds of events causes reputational injury,

6

financial injury, which the Secretary, by her instructions

7

to her agents, has prohibited any kind of administrative

8

review unless you're willing to fall on the sword and

suffer a termination.

10

QUESTION:

But you suggest no limitations for

your theory.

indicates to me that if we rule in your favor the current

regime of not attacking the regulations except in a

disputed claim will be completely displaced.

limitation on your theory.

16

Your answer to the Chief Justice's question

MR. ANDERSON:

I see no

I think the limitation is the

17

one -- you know, I think the scheme that I propose is the

18

one that Congress has intended, that when you have a

19

statutory or constitutional challenge to the Secretary's

20

rulemaking or regulations that is completely untethered to

21

a claim for benefits, or completely untethered to a claim

for provider status, termination or nonrenewal, then those

MR. ANDERSON:

The standing is the fact that

3

these rules and regulations that I've described are

actually being enforced, and they are actually causing

5

harm to our members.

6

QUESTION:

Well then, that suggests that there

may be -- might be someone who could bring a so-called

Yes.

You tether it to a

You fall on -- the provider says, okay, I'm

13

claim under section 1395cc(b).

14

QUESTION:

I'm going to suffer a

But your argument is that you should

bring what you call an -- you can bring what you call an

18

MR. ANDERSON:

No.

I would not agree that we

MR. ANDERSON:

I think the answer is that Ringer

itself and its progeny has characterized that case as one

QUESTION:

On the question of cooperation, Salfi

15

itself was an example of that, wasn't it, because as I

16

understand that claim, it hadn't gone the entire

17

administrative route, but the court said, the Secretary

18

can waive the exhaustion part of it.

19

What can't be waived is going in that 405 (g)

20

and (h) door, but they hadn't come to the end of the line

21

before the administrator in Salfi, and yet the court said

22

that judicial review under 405(g) and (h) would be okay if

23

the Secretary waives going through to the end.

Isn't that correct about --

extent in Salfi?
MR. ANDERSON:

I think for Mr. Salfi, he had

Honor is correct that he had not --

exhaustion could be excused.

you're upset about the concern that you have to be

19

could have preenforcement review, but you had to exhaust

procedure before the Secretary before you got it.

Is there any other concern?

Is there -- I

That is, you had to write to the Secretary, or

ask the Secretary for a hearing, or ask the Secretary to

consider changing the regs, or present your objections,

QUESTION:

1

2

Do you have any objection to those

normal kind of exhaustion requirements?
MR. ANDERSON:

3

Yes, I do have some other

4

concerns, because the normal kind of exhaustion

5

requirements are bizarre as applied to this situation.

6

We -- the Secretary would have us incur the expense and

7

time, which often takes months or years, to go through an

8

administrative process where the hearing officer ALJ is

9

barred from hearing our evidence, commenting on it, or

10

adjudicating it.
And then, as I was trying to explain, if we go

11
12

through that process without an adjudication, without any

13

fact-finding, without any clarification of the issues, now

14

we finally have the right to review under a district

court --

MR. ANDERSON:

Isn't there a way

The answer is, you

I don't know, and I don't think

10

there's any history of the Secretary being so benevolent.

11

I also want to comment, if I may -- you said do

12

I have any additional concerns, and I've tried to

13

articulate the falling on the sword, the futility of the

14

administration of the exhaustion remedy, but I have an

15

additional concern about the constraints that section

16

405(g) puts on a district court when one of these

17

claims -- hypothetically it's now gone through months, if

18

not years.

19

Now this claim arrives at the doorsteps of the

20

district court vested with jurisdiction only under section

21

40 -- 405(g).

That court's hands, I would suggest, are

22

really tied.

That court is sitting as basically a court

23

of review.

24

reverse the Secretary's decision.

25

Section 405(g) says it may affirm, modify, or

The Secretary herself has taken the position

that the district courts, sitting pursuant to section

2

405(g), have no fact-finding ability, that they are

3

sitting literally as courts of appeal.

position in a case called Grant v. Shalala.

Circuit decision, and the Third Circuit sustained the

6

Secretary's position, finding that the district courts had

7

no fact-finding ability.

8

9

She took that
It's a Third

The district court then is presented with an
inadequate factual record, because the ALJ couldn't hear

10

it, and the district court, if you read 405(g) literally,

11

can only remand to the Secretary, that as we know from

12

this Court's decision in the Nelconyan case, its powers to

13

remand are very limited.

14

It can remand only if the claimant has presented

15

new evidence, and by count of a rule 60 burden has to

16

demonstrate that the new evidence didn't exist and

17

couldn't have been presented to the Secretary, and that

18

good cause exists for not presenting it to the Secretary

19

on the way up through the administrative process.

20

So I would suggest that first of all we have the

21

falling on the sword, then we have the futility of

22

presenting your claim to an ALJ who won't hear it or rule

23

on it, and then you get to a court who the Secretary has

24

persistently maintained has very limited powers to sit

25

merely as a court of review.

I suggest that that is

absurd, to impute that intent to Congress with nary a

2

scintilla of evidence in the legislative history -QUESTION:

3

But I thought the Secretary had

4

conceded in this case that you could make your record in

5

the district court.

Am I wrong on that?

MR. ANDERSON:

6

I haven't heard that concession

7

from the Secretary.

I think that she's certainly taken

8

the position in other cases that the district court is

9

constrained.

10

QUESTION:

I'll look through the briefs again.

11

QUESTION:

As to questions over which the

12

Secretary has no confidence, like constitutional

13

questions, then the district court is the first instance

14

decider.

15

MR. ANDERSON:

Yes, but how can the district

16

court -- the district court is going to be constrained,

17

because sitting as a court of review, it is not going to

18

enjoy the benefit of a fully developed factual record that

19

may be necessary to resolve the constitutional claim and

20

so you have kind of a bizarre ping pong match, where the

21

case comes up to the district court without an adequate

22

record and the district court, trying to comply with

23

405(g) and this Court's decision in Nelconyan, says well,

with the Secretary that the district court can't take

MR. ANDERSON:

I'd like to just comment briefly,

before I sit down, on one final point about whether or not

Bowen v. Michigan Academy has any remaining vitality, or

has lost its precedential force.

that it does.

I suggest that if that's the case,
