ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL T. LEIBIG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LEIBIG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In July 1992 the county council, attorney for

14

Harris County, Texas wrote to the Department of Labor and

15

asked, while it is clear that the -- I'm quoting from

16

their letter to the county manager, to the Department of

17

Labor, and they asked whether -- while it was clear that

18

the sheriff may authorize an employee to use comp time

19

when he requests to use it, that the regulations and the

20

statute did not make clear whether an employer could

21

compel an employee to use compensatory time under the Fair

22

Labor Standards Act when the employee did not want to use

23

it, and they asked for an opinion from the Department of

24

Labor as to whether, under the regulations and the

25

statute, that would be allowed, and the Department of

Labor answered that on September 14, 1992 that absent an

agreement that was willingly accepted by the employees, an

employer could not compel the use of comp time under the

16

How many of these people were hired after this

MR. LEIBIG:

Well, there's -- in the record in

17

this case it's not clear when the parties came in effect.

18

It came into effect sometime between 1992 and 1993.

19

of the plaintiffs were working then.

20

QUESTION:

Most

But certainly, as to any plaintiffs

21

who were hired after 1992 or '93, if the Department said

22

this is going to be our program, and they took the job,

23

would that qualify as an agreement or understanding?

MR. LEIBIG:

It might, and I'll explain how, but

it depends on whether or not that was a -- clearly

Well, if they -In this case -All it has to be is -In this case the facts are --- clearly communicated when they

accepted the job.
MR. LEIBIG:

Excuse me.

In this case the facts

10

are that there was a county regulation saying that comp

11

time would be used, but it did not include an agreement

12

with regard to compelled use.

13

QUESTION:

Well, so far as an employee

14

accepting -- if you come to me looking for work and I say,

15

you know, you work 40 hours a week, and you'll be paid at

16

$10 an hour, and you go to work, you've accepted my deal,

17

have you not?

18

MR. LEIBIG:

1

QUESTION:

Yes.
I mean, you don't have to say -- it's

20

not a question of voluntary confession or something like

21

that.

22

MR. LEIBIG:

Right, but under the regulations

23

and the statute, and this is in section 207(o) itself, it

24

says the -- and in the regulation, it says that

25

compensatory time off in lieu of cash may be used, and may

but it says so long as the comp time agreement is

9

There's a specific

So, for example, in your accept -- in your
example, I could come -- you could say, I want you to come

10

to work with me for $10, which you unilaterally decided,

11

and I could accept that, and I would be knowingly,

12

voluntarily accepting it.

13

On the other hand, you could offer me the job

14

and I could say, no, I want $15, and you could say, well

15

then, you're not hired, but you could also say, then you

16

are hired, and then we'd have a bilaterally determined

17

condition of employment, and I think if you look at the

18

regulations, while the regulations are clear that it could

19

be a condition of employment, they're also clear that it

20

can only be a condition of employment so long as it is

21

accepted by the employees knowing in advance what the

22

rules on preservation --

What are we supposed to do about

that then the county would win, and I think everybody --

All right, so what are we supposed to

What we ask the Court to do is send

Of that point.
-- consistent with the Department

That's what we've asked for in the

Obviously, we could have asked for, to overturn

10

the court of appeals and uphold the trial court, but the

11

trial court did not make findings with regard to whether

12

or not an agreement existed and what the agreement was,

13

therefore that's not in the record, and if you want to

14

make it a condition of employment, first of all you have

15

to have exactly what the agreement was and, secondly, that

16

the employees knowingly and willingly accepted it.

17

QUESTION:

Was there any allegation by the

18

employer that there was anything other than an agreement

19

that there would be comp time?

20

allegation that any of this was fleshed out.
MR. LEIBIG:

21

No.

There wasn't any

In fact, the employer, both in

22

the answer to the amended complaint and the stipulation,

23

it's clear, and in their brief, they don't claim that

24

there was a specific provision on compelled use, and there

25

wasn't.

I mean, in fact there wasn't, but -- and neither

the district court nor the court of appeals, nor the

2

stipulation, includes that important factor --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. LEIBIG:

Then why would it --- which is why Judge Dennis

5

suggested that the trial court would have to make such a

6

determination in order to allow any court to apply the

7

applicable regulations.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, why would a trial court have to

make such a determination if the employer is not alleging

10

anything more than we had an understanding, they knew when

11

they took the job that it was going to be comp time

12

instead of overtime pay, and we didn't -- we're not

13

alleging that we spelled out the details of it.

14

alleging that they specifically consented to this --

Compelled use.
Well, I think the problem is in the

18

record the way the district -- the trial court did that,

19

they didn't get to the second point where they actually

20

said we're not alleging, the county is not -- that's why I

21

would --

QUESTION:

In any event, you --

QUESTION:

Even if they didn't, do you think it

is a reasonable interpretation -- when the employer says,

time, do you think a reasonable interpretation of that is

2

that I can sit on my comp time, refuse to use it until I

3

finally retire, and then cash it in --

4

MR. LEIBIG:

5

QUESTION:

6

-- at time and a half?

You think

that's a reasonable interpretation --

7

MR. LEIBIG:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes.

Well --- when the employer says, what

you're going to get is comp time, and my follow-up

10

question is, do you think it's a reasonable interpretation

11

of a statute --

12

MR. LEIBIG:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- which says you can give an

14

employee comp time instead of overtime, that it means the

15

employee can sit on the comp time until he retires and

16

then cash it in for overtime pay?

17

MR. LEIBIG:

Yes, I do, because the statue also

18

says -- first of all, yes, I think it's reasonable.

19

Second of all, the statute itself also says that there's

20

a -- expressly in the statute there's a 480-hour cap on

21

comp time banks, and that after the employees reach that

22

cap, they then can use the comp time, and it has -- it

23

deals with how to use it, by making requests and so forth,

24

and therefore it -- the statute doesn't give an employer a

25

permanent right to use compensatory time.

QUESTION:

1

Well, as I understood the statute, it

was enacted in response to the complaint of the States

that now that you're applying the Fair Labor Standards Act

to us we're going to go bankrupt.

We cannot pay time and
So Congress

But what you're urging here, to wit, that the

policemen and firemen can simply refuse to use the comp

time.

11

MR. LEIBIG:

12

QUESTION:

Right.

That's because --

And then get it in cash.

It just

13

makes -- it just makes nothing of the concession that

14

Congress made to the States.

15

MR. LEIBIG:

Justice Scalia, I would argue that

16

the Congress didn't quite make as broad a concession as

17

you indicated, because --

18

QUESTION:

1

MR. LEIBIG:

No, I --- first of all the statute itself

20

says that an employer may use comp time only pursuant to

21

an agreement with the employees, and only pursuant to a

22

number of other conditions.

23

delegates to the Department of Labor to make regulations

24

about what that means, and the Department of Labor has

25

made regulations that make precisely clear what those are.

The statute also says,

1

In addition, while the legislative history

2

indicates that Congress was trying to respond to Garcia

3

and allow employers to operate more efficiently, the

4

legislative history is also clear that the comp time

5

provisions were meant to accommodate preexisting

6

arrangements between employers and employees, and that

7

they weren't the major part of the cost saving.

8

They gave greater flexibility to the employer,
but the statute and the legislative history repeatedly is

10

also clear they gave a right to the employees to use it to

11

control the comp time in the legislation.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Leibig --

QUESTION:

Within reason.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Leibig, let me get the procedural

15

history of this case straight.

16

summary judgment for your client.

17

Circuit, the Fifth Circuit granted summary judgment for

18

the county and Judge Dennis said, really neither side

1

should get summary judgment, and your position here is

20

that Judge Dennis was correct?

21

MR. LEIBIG:

The district court granted
It went to the Fifth

Our position, and what we asked for

22

in both of our briefs, is that the case should be remanded

23

for further hearing in terms of the Department of Labor

regulations, which required the investigation of the

extent and meaning of the agreement and how the agreement

MR. LEIBIG:

The Department of Labor's

interpretation of their own regulations, which is

expressed -- well, first of all, there's three of them.
First of all, it's expressed specifically in the letter --

10

the specific letter, which in this case was actually a

No.

Well, I wanted to -- no.

And

6

then in support of that, the question is, how did the

MR. LEIBIG:

No.

I think the rule is if an

adequate notice is given and the employee says nothing and

works, the presumption is that he accepted it, but if he

Why not?

Well -They're saying, look, we're doing it

21

Well, first of all -And the wage and hour law doesn't

MR. LEIBIG:

as the control over cash is a central aspect of its value,

control over the use of comp time is central to its value,

But the Congress did impose a ceiling

which wasn't pursued on appeal, was that they were not

the work rules?
MR. ROBERTS:

11

Yes.

You could look at it that

12

way.

The reason that the default isn't that the employer

13

sets the work rules is that Congress has displaced that

14

principle that the employer can set the rules in the act

15

by making -- by giving the employee the right to overtime

16

and by providing that the employer can only have a comp

17

time arrangement pursuant to the employee's consent.

The question is, how detailed the

consent must be.

MR. ROBERTS:

out of it.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL P. FLEMING

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

8

MR. FLEMING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

One reason, or the main reason on why there

10

aren't any regulations that address this issue, and there

11

really aren't, is because of the -- what's really taking

12

place in this, what's been termed a forced use of

13

compensatory time.

14

The Fair Labor Standards Act basically provides

15

for a minimum wage rate and maximum number of hours.

16

There's no provision in there that guarantees a 40-hour

17

week, work week.

18

work week short, to have an employee work 30 hours, 20

19

hours, 10 hours, 1 hour, and in the Fair Labor Standards

20

Act there's a very specific provision that allows

21

employers to cash out accrued compensatory time at any

22

time.

employer from doing so simultaneously to achieve the

2

objectives which were set out in the amendments following

3

the Garcia decision, that is, to protect the county's

4

resources and budgets and really, in this situation, to

5

protect against employees that do bank their comp time and

6

hold it to the maximum.

QUESTION:

You mean, the employee normally has a

8

40-hour week, say, you just come in 35 hours this week,

9

I'll pay you for 40, right, and the other 5 will be paying

10

down your comp time, right?

12

Yes, Justice Scalia, and in

So what's the big deal, then?

MR. FLEMING:

Why do

Why don't they just do

That's what we do.

What happens

17

is that they'll -- after the supervisor tries to reach an

18

agreeable time for the employee to start taking time off

19

and getting paid in cash from their compensatory time

20

that's been accumulated, if the employee doesn't do it,

21

then he meets with him and orders him to do it, and still

22

tries to get a reasonable period of time when they can do

23

it, and if not, then issues an order for the employee to

24

do it.

week the employee is going to take off, the employee

2

doesn't come in to work that week but he still gets his

3

paycheck, 40 hours of pay, and mind you, that pay has been

accumulated at time and a half, so they're still getting

the benefit of the time-and-a-half provisions of the Fair

11

everybody agrees you should be able to do that, but you

12

have to get your employees' agreement to it, just as you'd

13

have to to get his agreement to comp time in the first

14

place, and so you have to get that agreement anyway.

15

What's the big deal?

both sides, which there are, you could have a background

6

MR. FLEMING:

Well --

What is your response?
That's a good question, and in

7

addition to the default rule, which Judge Hickinbotham of

8

the Fifth Circuit said, where he sort of filled in the

9

gaps of what he perceived the agreement would be, in

10

addition to the fact that under the statute we don't have

11

to have an agreement, is our position, really how the case

12

evolved, though, is up until we got to this Court the

13

petitioner was saying that it's completely prohibited by

14

the act, agreement or no agreement, and it was our

15

position that it's -- we're allowed to do it by the act,

16

and that's still our position.

17

QUESTION:

Well, and now in this Court everybody

18

agreed that there can be an understanding.

about what notice the employees have to be given, so

20

there's no question that from now on Harris County can

say, this is the deal, employees.

Yes.

That's --

So you must have an agreement to comp

MR. FLEMING:

QUESTION:

Which we have.

And the question is, what are the

terms and conditions of that comp time?

and at a certain point you're going to have to take it?

2

Why shouldn't that be spelled out, instead of the employee

3

thinking, well, this is fine.

4

and if I don't need it, I'll bank it, and the statute says

5

after X number of hours I get paid in cash.
MR. FLEMING:

6

If I need it, I'll use it,

Justice Ginsburg, I agree that it

7

can be in an agreement, certainly.

But just as the Fifth

Circuit said, that there are workplace rules which the
employee governs, in this case, this is something that is

outside of the act.

Is that what you did here?

I am in

some perplexity.

I thought your opponent had acknowledged

that it would be okay for the employer just to say, next

1

the money that it saves, the 5 hours, add a little bit

20

more to it for the time and a half, and voluntarily, as

21

it's entitled to do, buy out 5 hours worth of the comp

Now, is it common ground that that is okay?

I want to go back to your answer to

If I understand it correctly,

what this case boils down to is this.

13

If you reduce hours on a regular basis, and you

14

also choose to cash out a portion of the accumulated time

15

every week, no problem, no argument, but if you do it on

It's symmetry, but if you go back

to what Justice Scalia said at the very beginning of the

13

the Federal service for some people to save up sick time,

14

which they're entitled to be compensated for at the end of

15

their service, and it was not an unheard-of practice for

16

people to save up vacation time, which is why some

17

employers require you to take your vacation, because

18

people would work the whole year and then, you know, save

19

up all their vacation time, retire a year earlier.

20

don't think it's at all fanciful to think that people

21

would bank this stuff.

They get the same paycheck, but

employees take the time off, and I think the concerns when

2

these enactments of '85 went into effect was that the

3

employees are able to use the time, are able to take the

4

time off.

On the other side -QUESTION:

5

So they're protective devices so that

6

we do not build -- the employee does not build up so much

7

comp time that the employer in effect is not, at the end

8

of the road, going to be able to pay it.

It's for the

protection of the employee, you're saying.
MR. FLEMING:

10

It's a balancing.

An employee's

11

protection is this, is that in the statute, as was

12

mentioned, the employee is allowed to use it within a

13

reasonable time if there isn't an undue disruption, and so

14

the focus there is on the employee's ability to use the

15

time.

16

On the other side, the employer's controls over

17

this, since it is a balance, is the employer's ability to

18

cash them out.

1

And I might add that on the ability of the

20

employers to cash them out, it's an important distinction,

21

because it is -- that division gives the employers

22

control, and the petitioners have maintained well, this

23

comp time accumulation is under the sole control of the

24

employees, and there certainly would be circumstances

time, and it would be contrary to what the employees

2

wished to do, such as if they wanted to stop them from

3

using it at a certain time of the year, or if there had

4

been an increase, county-wide budget increase in pay, the

goes into effect.

That hasn't been done in this case, but in -that certainly reflects that the act provides the employer
with a certain degree of control over these comp time

Well, why doesn't that just

16

then it's perfectly logical for the statute to say, you

can -- employer, you can always pay time and a half.

can do the other if the employees agree to it, but you can

MR. FLEMING:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.

And so it does suggest to me that

3

this is a statute where the main rule is time and a half,

4

but you have an exception.

5

narrowly, not broadly, and if Congress' idea is, let the

6

workers know what you're doing, then it's just a question

7

of notice, and you didn't give them notice of anything

8

other than you were going to install comp time.

9

Usually we construe exceptions

You didn't give them any notice that, quite

10

contrary to what the statute indicates, that is, they may

11

request it and the employer has to give it to them if it

12

won't unduly disrupt.

13

doesn't seem to have space for a rule that says, and

14

without prior notice you can require them to take it.

It just doesn't seem -- the statute

MR. FLEMING:

15

It doesn't, but I don't think it's

16

necessary, because I don't think that scheduling less than

17

40 hours a week is within the purview of the Fair Labor

18

Standards Act.

19

specifically, and so when we have the comp time agreement,

20

which we have with the employees, it's to use the comp

21

time, and then it's in accordance with the Fair Labor

22

Standards Act, which it says, and so if we do that,

23

though, within the Fair Labor Standards Act we can cash

24

them out.

25

Cashing them out at any time is,
