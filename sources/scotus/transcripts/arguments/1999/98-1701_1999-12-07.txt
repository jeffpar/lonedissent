ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. JONATHAN BENNER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 98-1706

12

MR. BENNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
From the first day of our existence as a Nation,

13

we've relied on the merchant ships of the United States

14

and foreign nations to bear the vast preponderance of our

15

interstate and our foreign commerce.

16

amicus submissions on this side of the argument that give

17

you some sense not only of the historic scope of that

18

reliance, but also the present scope and the complexity of

19

the routes that these vessels travel.

20

There have been some

Each of these vessels is a complex collection of

21

systems and subsystems, both structural and mechanical,

22

but also each depends on the knowledge and skill and

23

judgment of mariners not only from the United States, but

24

from around the world.

25

to an intricate Federal system of permits, inspections,

Each of these vessels is subject

They understood that each vessel

10

carried with it a physical projection of the sovereignty

11

of another Nation and they knew that the citizens aboard

12

that vessel often were from other nations and that along

13

with the possibility of prosperity that came with these

14

maritime transactions, there also was the possibility of

15

conflict with other nations in how we dealt with those

16

vessels when they called at our ports.

17

The United States and Intertanko here seek

18

reversal of a decision from the Ninth Circuit Court of

19

Appeals which I believe for the first time in the history

20

of the United States countenanced an intrusion by a State

21

government, in this case the State of Washington, into

22

areas that are exclusively regulated by the Federal

23

Government.

3

has strong Federal connotations that must be protected in

4

this case.

5

This is the realm that we believe

By inserting itself into these subject matters,

6

our concern is that the State of Washington necessarily

7

displaces Federal judgments governing these vessels and

8

compromises the constitutionally essential supremacy of

9

Federal law in this particular area.

10

The practical --

11

QUESTION:

May I -- may I ask you, Mr. Benner,

12

if you take the position that all 13 of the provisions

13

before us here are preempted by Federal law itself or that

14

some of them are preempted by Coast Guard regulation?

15

MR. BENNER:

We take the position that all of

16

them, Justice O'Connor, are preempted by Federal law

17

itself in the subject matters described in 46 U.S.C.,

18

section 3703.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. BENNER:

21

Some sort of field preemption.
Yes.

We -- we do contend -- and

I'll be very clear about that.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. BENNER:

Yes.
There is a condition of field

24

preemption that surrounds that component of the United

25

States Code.

QUESTION:

1

So, your first position would be that

2

field preemption applies and we don't have to look

3

further.

4

MR. BENNER:

5

Now, like people in our profession have a

That is correct.

tendency to do, we have also pointed to express --

7

QUESTION:

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. BENNER:

A fail-back provision.

We -- we have also pointed to -- to

10

instances in which the United States Coast Guard has

11

spoken expressly preemptively in its regulations and that

12

those express preemptive statements are entitled to

13

deference.

14

QUESTION:

And there you rely on Coast Guard

15

regulations that contain language expressly preempting

16

State law?

17

MR. BENNER:

Yes, that is correct.

The Coast

18

Guard has said on several occasions, in issuing

19

regulations pursuant to title 46 and also to title 33,

20

that it is the Coast Guard's intent to oust differential

21

State action in those areas.

22

23

QUESTION:

But if the Coast Guard were silent on

some of these points, you still think there is Federal --

Indeed, Justice O'Connor, that

Your first

I know your second is.
MR. BENNER:

Yes.

I -- I believe it is, Justice

6

Stevens.

7

certainly acknowledge that in Ray the issues you were

8

looking at in that decision were design and construction

9

elements.

We are saying here -QUESTION:

10
11

The -- Ray we rely on heavily, but I -- I

Well, but also the Court held that

some of the regulations were valid in that -MR. BENNER:

12

The -- the two that were held valid

13

by the Court in Ray that -- that maybe illustrate our

14

point are, one, a tug escort provision, which was not held

15

valid under what we are calling title II, as a shorthand

16

reference, to PWSA, the 3703(a) subject matters, but was

17

held valid under title I of PWSA which was a discretionary

18

element of the law and remains a discretionary element of

19

the law.

20

States do have an ability to act in these discretionary

21

areas -- and the tug escort provision was deemed to be one

22

-- if the Federal Government has not acted.

We read the Court's decision in Ray to say the

23

Now, a salient point in the fact pattern that we

24

present to you here is that in every single element of the

25

challenged State regulations, there is a corresponding

Federal regulation.

2

QUESTION:

We do not believe -Oh, I understand that, but that's

3

your second -- that's your fall-back argument.

4

argument is the statute itself, 3703, takes care of

5

everything.

6

MR. BENNER:

Your first

That is our argument because we

7

believe that every one of these regulations falls within

8

the understood meaning of design, construction,
alteration, repair, maintenance, particularly in this case

10
11
12

13
14

personnel qualifications and manning and operations.
QUESTION:

Why should manning and operations --

I mean, why shouldn't the State have something to say
about that?
MR. BENNER:

I think to understand why it's

15

important to the Federal system, Your Honor, that -- that

16

all of these things work together, you have to understand

17

the system -- the vessel as a system.

18

describes a number of elements of the operation of the

1

vessel, all of which link together.

20

about is that if the States can selectively adjust

21

elements of that system, they are not in a position to

22

judge what the impact of that adjustment is.

1

MR. BENNER:

The language, Justice O'Connor,

2

that you find in -- in much of the maritime preemption

3

case law that this Court has generated about local

4

conditions seems to be related to such matters as fishing,

5

conservation, that kind of thing, or is -- is recited

before, in the case of Ray, finding that the tug escort

provision was a title I discretionary PWSA matter.

8

believe that the significance of local conditions --

9

QUESTION:

We

Well, how do we know that the -- the

10

provisions of Washington law you are contesting

11

necessarily fall under title II and not under title I?

12

seems that some title I subjects involve operations.

13

MR. BENNER:

Yes.

I -- I do acknowledge,

14

Justice Ginsburg, that in title I you have vessel

15

operating requirements as -- as part of the statutory

16

description of the field there; whereas, in title II you

17

have operations.

18

It

We -- as a first level answer to your question,

19

we contend it doesn't make any difference to our

20

preemption analysis.

21

is heavily preemptive, and if you look at Ray, it's very

22

clear that the Court found that the congressional decision

23

to permit State action with regard to structures included

24

an implicit decision to ban the States from regulating

25

with regard to vessel standards.

We're contending that even title I

The thing that saved the tug escort requirement

in Ray and which is not applicable here was the absence of

claiming field preemption.
QUESTION:

But Justice Ginsburg's question drew

3

your attention to the fact that you could place these

4

matters under title I.

5

MR. BENNER:

I -- I don't believe you can place

6

all of them under title I.

The -- the ambiguity about the

7

distinction between title I and title II is the use of the

8

word operating requirements in title I and the word

9

operations in title II.

We contend that all of these

10

provisions fall within title II because they're either

11

operations, personnel qualifications, or manning

12

requirements that -- and -- and we accept your -- your

13

proposition that, because we are arguing field preemption,

14

the States are completely barred from entering that area.

within the local peculiarities of the waterways, and those

concern the advance notice of entry, the position

plotting, and restricted visibility watchkeeping

requirements.
I would point out to the Court that the State of

12

Washington here has not attempted to justify in its

13

rationale for these rules that they are related at all to

14

the peculiarities of Washington waters.

Our position is, consistent with Ray, that

QUESTION:

Well, you say that that would be bad

only if it's covered by a Coast Guard regulation.
MR. FREDERICK:

6

That's correct.

And the Court

7

made very clear with the tug escort requirement in that

8

case that if the Coast Guard had issued a tug escort

9

requirement, that that would occupy the field as to tug

10

escorts and would not preempt a -- and would not be

preemptive of a State rule if there was no Coast Guard

Right?

And -- and, you know, some

of them in our view would be deemed manning requirements,

contrary Coast Guard determinations to issue a rule as to

those kinds of conditions.

QUESTION:

Mr. Frederick, the lower courts

10

didn't get into any of -- any of this, and so far, no one

11

has mentioned the basis of their decision which was

12

section 1018.

13
14
15

So -- so --

MR. FREDERICK:

I would be happy to address the

error of the court of appeals' reasoning.
In our view, section 1018 of the Oil Pollution

16

Act has no applicability to this case whatsoever.

17

plain language of that statute, which respondents do not

18

contest our argument -- it begins with the phrase, nothing

19

in this act -- i.e., nothing in OPA -- shall affect the

20

right of the States to impose additional requirements.

Nothing in section 1018 affects the ability -- the

court gave a rather restricted reading of Ray, simply

2

assuming that its principles went no further than the

design and construction, shouldn't we simply at that point

4

vacate and send this thing back rather than in the first

instance, as if we were a court of -- of first instance,

parse our way through every regulation?

7

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Souter, that would be an

8

eminently reasonable holding of this Court.

We have

9

offered illustrations in our submissions so that the

concreteness of the dispute is apparent to the Court, and

11

in our view some of these rules are sufficiently clearly

12

preempted that the Court could hold them so.

It

doesn't make much sense to say -- to be sure, it only

deals with the preemptive effect of -- of that

legislation, but it doesn't make much sense to say the

Doesn't it, in effect, acknowledge that under

MR. FREDERICK:

20

No, Justice Scalia, for several

21

reasons.

First, the Oil Pollution Act addresses pollution

22

not only from vessels but from land-based sources.

23

when Congress was attempting to save from preemptive

24

effect preexisting authority, there is clearly State

25

police power with respect to land-based oil pollution.

So,

1

There's no indication at all in the legislative history of

2

-- of the Oil Pollution Act, and in particular section

3

1018 where the conference committee that added that

4

section said expressly that it had no intent to undo Ray

5

v. Atlantic Richfield, which clearly upheld the preemptive

6

scope of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act.

7

Moreover, there are things that are clearly

8

saved by 1018, the response that a State can make to oil

9

pollution, additional liability requirements that a State

10

might impose, penalties for polluters, requirements and

11

certificates of financial responsibility.

12

mean that it brings the State on board the vessel to

regulate the subjects that have been historically within

the realm of Federal regulation.

Well, I think there are a couple

of errors.

The principal one is, as you say, that -- that

somehow in a later act Congress intended, silently without

saying so in a seven-word phrase, to eviscerate literally

24

thousands of pages of Federal statutory and regulatory and

international treaty law.

that Congress would have intended to do that.
It also read a savings clause so broadly as to

eviscerate specific directives contained in Federal law in

In two ways.

They cover the

subjects in title II that are field preemptive and the

8

Secretary is obliged under the statute to honor reciprocal

rights.

They also are given licenses, and the -- the

uninterrupted flow of this Court's cases since Gibbons v.

Ogden is that a State may not supplement or augment a duly

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

This case concerns Washington's authority to

prevent oil spills from tankers traveling on Puget Sound

5

and in the Columbia River.

6

Congress has not expressly preempted the State's

7

authority to regulate companies that operate oil tankers

8

in Washington, nor do we believe has Congress impliedly

9

expressed a broad intent to preempt State authority in

10

this field.

11

Coast Guard rules and the international regime, and there

12

is no conflict.

13

Washington's prevention rules complement

I want to just spend a moment talking about the

14

State's regulatory regime because, contrary I think to the

15

position of the United States and Intertanko, it is a

16

complementary system, not a conflict system.

17

First of all, we regulate by requiring the

18

owners and operators of tankers to file a prevention plan,

19

and that plan must meet certain requirements.

20

requirements were developed in -- in consultation with

21

both the Coast Guard and the tanker industry, and they

involve a lot -- many of the rules involve simply

operations on local waters, that is, the twisting, narrow

MR. COLLINS:

But in analyzing -- in other

words, in Ray the Court didn't simply say everything

MR. COLLINS:

Your Honor, I believe that in Ray

was upheld because of a specific statute.
But in spite of that specific statute, the Court

went out of its way to contrast a pilotage requirement

from a design and construction requirement.

that wasn't the analysis in Ray, Justice Breyer.

21

the Court did not say -- I will -- I will agree that the

Court in Ray did make a reference to the mandatory nature,

did point out that title II used the word shall.

the word shall prescribe regulations is there and

13

preemption if, and only if, the Secretary decides to issue

14

a regulation.

So, we're both at that point.

15

MR. COLLINS:

16

QUESTION:

Right?

Well, I'm not --

And you -- now you're going to say

17

even if the Secretary does issue a regulation, still there

18

is not necessarily preemption.

19

MR. COLLINS:

Not necessarily field preemption,

Your Honor.

We would agree that if the Secretary issues a

regulation -- I mean, you've got to take a look to see

It seems to me, Your Honor, that

what the Ninth -- in the action below, as Mr. Benner said,

of what they say are illustrative examples of potential

So, Justice Souter, you had talked about what

should happen to this case if things go south for the

State of Washington and whether it should be remanded to

But I think that would be

what seems to be these threshold -- perhaps threshold

errors on the part of the court of appeals.

MR. COLLINS:

So, from our point of view, Your

Honor, what we think should happen in this case is the

Court should rule that there is no broad field preemption

result at the Ninth Circuit.

I'm not sure that's quite consistent

with the record because at page 30a of the Ninth Circuit

opinion, they -- they refer to the fact that Intertanko

10

did call attention to several regulations as being

11

expressly preempted by Coast Guard regulations, identified

12

some in the text and some in the footnote.

think you can tell us that the specific conflicts with

MR. COLLINS:

That is to say --

Certainly, but that fall-back

MR. COLLINS:

QUESTION:

Yes.

No, that's right.

agree with that position or don't.

And that was, as I understood their

question, so let me try to get back to it.

The only thing that was argued below I believe
on those points was the simple declaration by the Coast
Guard that the State should be excluded.

MR. COLLINS:

QUESTION:

15

MR. COLLINS:

By virtue of the declaration.

Well.
But -- well -- but I think there's

16

a difference, Your Honor.

believe that the Ninth Circuit said that Coast Guard

regulations could not preempt State authority, and indeed,

if you read it that way, we would disagree with it.

clear that Coast Guard regulations would preempt the State

if there's a -- if there's a conflict.

MR. COLLINS:

Congress could do that.
Congress could do that.

And you're saying that Congress

didn't delegate that function to the Coast Guard.

6

MR. COLLINS:

QUESTION:

8

MR. COLLINS:

Right, for field preemption.

Yes.
And so -- and that's of some

concern to us because if that's the rule, then the Coast
10

Guard can eliminate State participation by simply adopting

11

a rule saying we intend that no State shall adopt any

12

rules or regulations pertaining to oil tankers.

13

believe that just that declaration is beyond the Coast

14

Guard authority.

15

QUESTION:

And we

Congress could delegate that to the

Coast Guard if it chose.
MR. COLLINS:

I think Congress could do that if

18

it -- Congress could itself say we intend to exclude the

1

States from this field, and they could --

20

QUESTION:

What if Congress said in the -- in

21

the delegation of the Coast Guard, we authorize the Coast

22

Guard to determine whether or not the States should be

excluded from this field?

of authority that we do not believe that it has been

given.

3

QUESTION:

But otherwise you say we should look

4

at title I and -- and ask whether the Coast Guard

5

implicitly meant to preclude the States?
MR. COLLINS:

6

No.

I think what you have to do

7

under -- frankly, under both title I and title II is look

8

to see whether there's a conflict; that is, look at the

9

purpose and object of the congressional enactment and the

10

Coast Guard regulation and look to see if State law is

11

preventing the achieving of that objective, either through

12

physical impossibility -- and of course, in this case,

13

there's no contention of physical impossibility -- or

14

through preventing the Coast Guard from achieving some

15

important objective.

16

was not the case that was made below.

17
18

QUESTION:

And that kind of a case was not --

Is -- is uniformity of maritime

regulation an important objective?

MR. COLLINS:

is needed.

There's also a

Uniformity would probably dictate that a State

could not say -- if the Coast Guard says the crew of the

QUESTION:

Yes.

11

MR. COLLINS:

-- they actually got that from the

provision in OPA '90 -- and I think it's -- let's see.

You're saying that -- that the

That's not persuasive --

MR. COLLINS:

No.

I'm not sure that that's

QUESTION:

1

Before you do that, you mentioned and

2

you placed considerable reliance on Askew.

3

understand that case, it involved only what is now an

4

undisputed matter, that is, that the States can impose

5

additional liability for an oil spill.

6

understand the holding to be dealing with anything pre-

7

incident.
MR. COLLINS:

8

9

And as I

I -- I didn't

Your Honor, I think my reference

to Askew was a -- was to argue that this Court shouldn't

10

just send this back to determine conflict preemption

11

because the conflicts that the Government raises are

12

speculative and weren't raised below, and those are better

13

left for another day.

14

confirms that States can regulate in the maritime area,

15

but I mean, it's not directly -- I mean, we're talking

16

about different kinds of requirements.

17

about that.

18

I mean, I don't -- Askew I think

So, you're correct

The -- the Government has -- has talked about

19

these certificates that I talked about a little bit

20

earlier as a license and has said that States cannot

21

impose any kind of licensing -- once something is

22

licensed, then that's the end of it and States can't

23

regulate.

24

And I submit that that is simply not correct.

25

If a State, as I said earlier, if a foreign flag tanker

has a license, it can still be subject to

2

nondiscriminatory environmental regulations imposed by the

3

State.

4

indicated that the fact that there was a license didn't

5

mean that you couldn't have other kinds of State

6

regulations.

7

referred to by counsel, there the State of New York was

8

trying to create a monopoly and exclude commerce.

9

And this Court itself in the Florida Lime case

Certainly in the Ogden v. Gibbons case,

Quite a different system here, where what we're

10

trying to do is preserve the ability of the State to

11

regulate in -- in a couple of areas.

12

that are local to Washington waters that relate directly

13

to the unique areas of Puget Sound, and secondly, we have

14

requirements that mirror international standards.

15

First of all, things

We think this is awfully important because it's

16

a second set of eyes on the -- on the ground -- at sea.

17

We conduct annual safety inspections to see if tankers are

18

complying with their prevention plans.

19

work very cooperatively with the Coast Guard people there.

20

We give them information, they give us information.

21

whole system of cooperative federalism working together we

22

think will make the waters safer, and ultimately we think

23

that's what Congress intended.

25

needed to be exclusive, the kinds of certificates that I

Therefore, we would ask this Court to affirm the

result by the Ninth Circuit and continue to give

Washington the authority to regulate and preserve the

Mr. Frederick, you have 2 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

9

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER UNITED STATES
MR. FREDERICK:

10

11

I'd like to make a -- a couple

of points.

12

First,

I direct the Court's attention to three

13

footnotes in our reply brief which I think will help the

14

Court in its opinion in this case.

15

12, and 14.

16

Those are footnotes 4,

Footnote 4 sets out those BAP rules that are

17

directly in fields that we think are preempted under the

18

field preemptive theory of title II.

19

Footnote 12 sets out the BAP rules where there

20

is a subject covered by a license and that includes things

21

like language proficiency which is clearly a personnel

22

qualification and the like.

23

And note 14 is the only one where there arguably

24

might be a reason to remand for purposes of developing a

25

record.

I would note that at the district court both

1

sides made consensual motions for summary judgment and

2

viewed this as something that could be decided on the

3

record.

4

could be the case here as well.

5

As to those subjects in the field, that clearly

The treaties that I emphasized in my opening

6

presentation reinforce the preemption that Congress

7

specified in title II, and those treaties make very clear

8

the reciprocal rights that must be afforded.

9

Washington here is -- is purporting to be able to do is to

What

10

imprison and impose civil fines against vessels and their

11

operators for people who don't comply with State rules.

12

That's directly contrary to a long line of this Court's

13

decisions that say that States can't supplement Federal

14

licenses or federally recognized licenses.

15

Now, with respect to language proficiency,

16

counsel is simply incorrect, and I would direct the

17

Court's attention to page 36 of our opening brief where we

18

make very clear that the purpose behind the international

19

STCW requirement is to ensure that the vessel as a system

20

can work appropriately so that those officers on the

21

navigation watch can communicate with the people who will

22

be carrying out the orders.

23

problem in some circumstances and not the solution and

24

that is a reflection of the way the international maritime

25

commerce works.

English may, in fact, be the

Finally,

1

I would just point out that the flag

2

state controls, and with respect to drug testing and

3

alcohol, there is a Coast Guard regulation that makes

4

clear -- it's at 33 C.F.R.

5

foreign or otherwise, may operate in U.S. waters by

6

personnel who have an alcohol level above .04.

7

is indeed different from a zero tolerance level, but that

8

is a determination made by the Coast Guard.
