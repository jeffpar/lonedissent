ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

8

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

9

11

MR. MINEAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents another chapter in the

12

Arizona v. California water rights adjudication.

13

involves the so-called boundary land claims that were left

14

undecided in Arizona I and Arizona II.

15

The case

The United States takes exception to the

16

Master's recommendation that a 1983 Claims Court consent

17

judgment between the United States and the Quechan Tribe

18

precludes litigation of their water rights claim

19

concerning the Quechan boundary lands.

20

concluded that the settlement extinguished the tribe's

21

right to those lands and, therefore, eliminated the basis

22

for claiming water rights in this adjudication.

23

25

QUESTION:

The Master

Mr. Minear, where do we find the best

map showing the boundaries of the land in question?
MR. MINEAR:

I think the -- the best map would

be that that is appended to the tribe's brief, the red-

2

colored brief.

QUESTION:

4

MR. MINEAR:

5

Okay.
There are two maps here.

One is

the general locator map which shows the -QUESTION:

6

Well, the big one is just -- it's too

7

small to see.

The -- the one at page 24a, exhibit E?

8

that what you're referring to?
MR. MINEAR:

9

I was looking at locator map number

10

2 that's also included here, yes, the one that you're

11

showing me there.
QUESTION:

12

13

And are the -- is it blue boundary

that -- in that map that shows the land in question?

14

MR. MINEAR:

I believe that's so, although it's

15

actually more complicated than that because due to a

16

number --

17

QUESTION:

I just couldn't find anything that

18

really showed me what we were dealing with.

19

it's basically the land encompassed in blue.

20

Is

MR. MINEAR:

But you think

Yes, with -- with the understanding

21

that there are a number of allotments and other lands that

22

are excepted from that area.

23

QUESTION:

MR. MINEAR:

QUESTION:

Yes.
The actual lands -But -- and the total is some 25,000

acres?
MR. MINEAR:

2

3

That is correct.

The total -- the

maximum claim would be 25,000 acres.
QUESTION:

4

And is all of that land practicably

5

irrigable as the -- the cases deal with that term, all

6

25,000 acres, or some smaller portion of it?
MR. MINEAR:

7
8

Honor.
QUESTION:

9
10

A smaller portion of it, Your

And we don't know how much because it

hasn't been determined?
MR. MINEAR:

11

That is correct.

There were

12

preliminary determinations that were made by Special

13

Master Tuttle in the report that was reviewed in Arizona

14

II.

15

regard to the amount of practicable irrigable acreage

16

because of the way it disposed of that case.

17

However, the Court did not reach these issues with

QUESTION:

And the preliminary studies show how

18

-- how much in acre-feet of water year are we talking

19

about, probably?

20
21
22

23
24
25

MR. MINEAR:

I think it could be as much as

70,000 acre-feet.
QUESTION:

And how would that impact on existing

distribution and users?
MR. MINEAR:

Is that a significant figure?
It's a relatively small amount, but

of course, we're dealing with a part of the country where

all water is quite precious.

The total amount of water

2

that's divided by the -- the Boulder Canyon Act is 7 and a

3

half million acre-feet.

4

significant, but a relatively small portion of the total

5

amount.

So, 70,000 acres is -- is

I would like to return to the point I was making

6

7

before with regard to the Master's determination in this

8

case.

9

extinguished by the Claims Court consent judgment and,

He concluded, as I said, the tribe's lands were

10

therefore, there was no basis for claiming water rights in

11

this case.

12

erred because he misunderstood the judgment and the scope

13

of its preclusive effect.

14

And we -- we respectfully submit the Master

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Minear, now the Government

15

takes the position here with respect to the preclusion

16

claim which the Master rejected; that is, the change of

17

position on the part of the Government when the Interior

18

Solicitor changed his mind.

19

that that claim, the preclusion claim, was waived.

20

it with respect to the Court of Claims judgment preclusion

21

argument you don't take the position that that's waived?

22

MR. MINEAR:

There the Government says

That hasn't been our -- been our

23

argument, no.

24

does not have issue-preclusive effect.

25

I take

Our argument has been simply the judgment

And the reason for that is that for a judgment

1

to have preclusive effect, the issue underlying it must be

2

actually litigated and determined, and that determination

3

must be essential to the judgment that is entered.

4

that simply is not the case in this situation.
QUESTION:

5

And

Mr. Minear, I think that the States

6

are saying there's some kind of special preclusion rule

7

that they call a statutory preclusion.

8

the ordinary rule is the consent judgment doesn't decide

9

any issues.

10

They concede that

They say -- they use a term I hadn't heard

before, statutory preclusion.
MR. MINEAR:

11

Your Honor, the -- the State

12

parties are referring to the provisions for claim

13

preclusion that exist in the Indian Claims Commission Act.

14

And our understanding of that act is as follows.

15

dealt with the creation of a special commission, a Article

16

I court, to resolve Indian claims.

17

enacting the statute, Congress made quite clear what the

18

preclusive effect of that administrative body's claims

19

would be.

20

That act

And in the course of

And that's, of course, an appropriate thing for

21

Congress to do because, as this Court indicated in

22

University of Tennessee v. Elliott, it's for Congress to

23

determine what preclusive effect a -- an administrative

24

body might have.

25

And our view is that the statutory preclusion
7

1

that's provided is simply the equivalent of the merger in

2

bar rules that would -- would apply to a judicial

3

decision.

4

preclusion not issue preclusion.

Now, that deals with the question of claim

And what we have here with regard to the consent

5
6

judgment is a question of -- the more narrow question of

7

issue preclusion.

8

the Claims Court precluded any further assertions by the

9

tribe against the United States with respect to these

There's no doubt that the judgment by

10

lands.

11

made a determination with regard to the status of the

12

boundary lands.

13

The question that's presented here is whether it

And we believe it did not.

QUESTION:

Do you think it really was the -- the

14

intent of the legislation that established the Indian

15

Claims Commission that the United States should acquire a

16

judgment which lets the United States off and settles

17

matters as far as the Government is concerned but leaves

18

all of the settlers who -- who are on the reservation

19

entirely up in the air as to whether -- you know, what

20

their rights are with respect to the land?

21
22

23
24
25

MR. MINEAR:

Well, first, with regard to this

claim, none of those -QUESTION:

It doesn't seem to me that a -- that

a just -- just Government would do something like that.
MR. MINEAR:

None of those issues -- in this

1

case those issues will not arise, and the reason is this.

2

The judgment itself was predicated on the Secretary's 1978

3

order which dealt with those specific issues.

4

do believe that it would have claim-preclusive effect in

5

the sense that it was predicated on that judgment.

But

6

those issues are simply not before the Court here.

There

7

is -- there hasn't been any dispute with regard to any of

8

the settlers whose rights were protected by the

9

Secretary's order himself.
The question here instead is a quite different

10

11
12

13
14

And so, we

one.
QUESTION:

How are they protected by the

Secretary's '78 order?
MR. MINEAR:

I didn't -The -- the Secretary's '78 order,

15

followed by the Secretary's 1981 order, identified the

16

particular tracts of land that are owned by private

17

persons that the tribe has no claim to, and the tribe has

18

-- has indicated that it agrees with that -- that outcome.

19

So, those issues simply won't arise here.

20

The only question is --

21

QUESTION:

22

Well, they might change their mind in

the future.

23

QUESTION:

Yes.

24

QUESTION:

You say they won't arise because the

25

tribe now agrees, but they might change their mind.

They

1

changed their mind about this.
MR. MINEAR:

2

Well, I don't believe they changed

3

about this, that the tribe's positions -- they've put

4

forward alternative positions, but they have been

5

consistent.
QUESTION:

6

7

his mind about this.
MR. MINEAR:

8

9

Well, the Secretary certainly changed

The Secretary did change his mind,

but the position since 1978 has been consistent.
QUESTION:

10

Now, what if -- what if the -- what

11

if we were to accept the State's submission that the

12

Special Master's ruling on that aspect of res judicata was

13

wrong and that the fact that the Government changed its

14

mind is not a basis for going back into the case again?

15

How would that affect the Government's position with

16

respect to the rest of the articles -- the rest of its

17

arguments?

18

MR. MINEAR:

Well, I think that our position

19

here is that the -- the Secretary was entitled -- this

20

matter had not been determined and had been preserved by

21

this Court's decision in Arizona I in its decree in 1979.

22

The Court --

23

QUESTION:

Yes, but the -- the -- it was argued

24

to the Special Master that the Secretary's changing his

25

mind, not just the Solicitor's changing his mind, was

2

something that avoid the effect of res judicata.
MR. MINEAR:

3

that argument.

4

happened here --

5

No, I'm afraid I don't understand

As -- I believe that the -- what had

QUESTION:

I -- as I read these -- the Master's

6

report, it said that the -- it was an unforeseen

7

circumstance that the Margold opinion would be reversed by

8

a -- a later Solicitor and that, therefore, res judicata

9

didn't apply.

10

MR. MINEAR:

That was -- that was the ruling

11

that the Master gave in rejecting the State's argument

12

with regard to res judicata.

13

QUESTION:

Right.

Now, what if -- what if we

14

think the Master was wrong in rejecting the State's

15

argument for that reason?

16

MR. MINEAR:

I think the Master's decision, his

17

judgment, should still be affirmed for a quite different

18

reason, and that is that this Court in Arizona I made

19

clear that the boundary land issues would simply not be

20

reached in this litigation in Arizona I.

21

clear in its 1964 decree, and it extended it to this -- to

22

this reservation in its 1979 decree.

23

QUESTION:

And it made that

Well, what was the reason then for

24

arguing preclusion on this basis before the Master if it

25

didn't make any difference?

MR. MINEAR:

1

Well, we think that the -- the

2

Master simply misunderstood the law and the prior

3

proceedings here.
We think there are two issues here and let me

4
5

try and walk through each of them.
One is the -- the claim preclusion argument the

6

7

State is making in -- in an exception to the Master's

8

ruling which held that there was no claim preclusive

9

effect from this Court's past decisions.

This Court in

10

Arizona I said that we're not going to decide the boundary

11

land issues.

In Arizona II, the issue arose again.

QUESTION:

12

Well, it said boundary land issues

13

with regard to reservations, other than this one.

14

didn't name this one as one of the boundary land issues,

15

did it?

16
17

MR. MINEAR:

QUESTION:

19

MR. MINEAR:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. MINEAR:

23

In 1963, they addressed two

boundary land issues --

18

22

It

Right.
-- the Fort Mojave -Right.
-- and the Colorado River Indian

Reservation.
In 1979, it became clear, after the Secretary's

24

decision here, that there were three other reservations

25

that had these issues.

The Court in response, in 1979,
12

SUITE 400

1

entered a -- modified its decree to make clear that all

2

five reservations would now be -- their boundary lands

3

would be open.

4

the '79 decree.

5

And let me read the language to you from

The quantity fixed in paragraph 1 through 5 of

6

article 11(d) of said decree -- which deals with the

7

Indian reservations, all five of them -- shall continue to

8

be subject to appropriate adjustment by agreement or

9

decree of this Court in the event that the boundaries of

10

11

the respective reservations are finally determined.
Special Master Tuttle, when he saw this

12

provision, said, well, all of these issues are open, but

13

he said, ultimately I'm going to accept the Secretary's

14

decision as a final, conclusive determination of those

15

water rights -- and -- of those boundary lands and the

16

accompanying water rights.

17

This Court in Arizona II said, no, there has to

18

be judicial review of the Secretary's decision.

19

that's what the United States has sought since that time

20

with regard to the Quechan Tribe, and that's all we're

21

asking for here.

22

QUESTION:

And

How does that -- that's the -- when

23

you say judicial review -- maybe you could answer this

24

later if I'm not right on the point.

25

my understanding of this is that this whole problem arises

I think I am.

But

1

because we don't really know who owns this land, and there

2

was an opinion in the Interior Department that said at one

3

point the United States still owns it and then at another

4

point that the Indian tribe owns it.

5

MR. MINEAR:

6

QUESTION:

That's basically correct.
But suppose we accept your arguments

7

completely.

It's still open under the second decree to

8

make the argument and the settlement doesn't preclude it.

9

We still haven't answered who owns the land, have we?

10

MR. MINEAR:

11

QUESTION:

That's -And so what's supposed to happen

12

next?

Aren't we supposed to -- I mean, we'll solve all

13

these problems and we can find out who owns the land.

14

one point the district court was going to litigate that,

15

and they reached an answer, and the Ninth Circuit set it

16

aside for some reason and this Court split 4/4.

17

MR. MINEAR:

18

QUESTION:

19

the district court or we can?

20

MR. MINEAR:

That's correct.
All right.

So, we can't send it to
Who's supposed to know --

Right now at the -- after the --

21

the California case, the Ninth Circuit decision, this

22

Court appointed Special Master McGarr to decide these

23

issues and we thought to decide them on the merits.

QUESTION:

If

you're right, we then send it back to the Special Master

and ask him now to decide the question of who owns the

2

land.

3

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

Or in the alternative -- the

4

ultimate reason why we're trying to determine the land

5

here is to determine the amount of water that ought to be

dealt --

QUESTION:

till you decide who owns the land.

MR. MINEAR:
QUESTION:

10
11

Yes.
And -- and so,

it's -- I just wanted

to know who is supposed to decide that if you are right.

12

MR. MINEAR:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. MINEAR:

15

I know but you can't get the water

Yes.
And the answer is the Special Master.
The Special Master should decide

it.

MR. MINEAR:

To -- to be specific, obviously

this Court acts with the assistance of the Special Master.

Now, there was a case from the Ninth

third parties.

issue preclusion on circumstances like the ones here.

13

So, at least the Ninth Circuit has found

distinction here.

preclusion from an issue that is actually litigated and

cannot be issue preclusion where the issue is actually

MR. MUYS:

No.

But is that true

If -- if the tribe had had only

a claim for trespass by the Government and got paid for it

that if some other settlers or some third parties had

Congress refused to do so.

The tribe reopened the -- the Claims Court proceedings and

The settlement was prompted by this Court's 1983

me that if there had been a settlement which took into --

MR. MUYS:

He did.

MR. MUYS:

that we weren't untimely.

And --

And the

Government and the tribes haven't argued any for the

MR. MUYS:

MR. MUYS:

Yes.

The title was extinguished.

QUESTION:

Yes.

3

MR. MUYS:

Nothing has happened to that land in

the disputed area since 1983 decision.

5

and the Government prevented a decision on the merits

before Judge Brewster in the San Diego district court.

Then they acquiesced in our motion to reopen the decree,

In 1979, the Court made that clear.

QUESTION:

I thought it only said boundary lands

with respect to two other reservations.

specifically say boundary lands here.

5

MR. MINEAR:

It didn't

It implicitly -- I think that you

could read that implicitly into the -- into what the Court

determined.

8

explicit is the Court's 1979 decree where it makes clear

that all five -- all five reservation boundaries remain

That's how Master Tuttle read it.

And I think that discloses the -- the claimed

11

preclusion effect of this Court's past decisions.
With regard to the issue-preclusive effect

13
14

of the consent judgment.

I'd like to make several points

on that.

15

First of all, in answer to Justice Stevens'

question about the change in position of the United

17

States, since 1978, we have consistently taken a position

with regard to these lands.

to rely on those decisions.

way.

1

simply to preclude the claims against the tribe -- by the

2

tribe against the United States.

3

The United States and the tribe agreed on who

4

owned the land.

5

is simply no longer a controversy after the 1978 decision

6

that these lands were held by the tribe and that we were

7

paying trespass damages.

8

but if you look behind it, that's what you're going to

9

find.

That's what led to the settlement.

There

The judgment doesn't say that,

In that -- given that situation, we think the

10
11

fair thing to do is to litigate this question of the

12

validity of the Secretary's decision on the merits.

13

QUESTION:

It isn't just the judgment doesn't

14

say it, it's also that one of the claims that they made

15

was -- was the claim that was just inconsistent with the

16

-- with the fact that they accepted the Solicitor's new

17

opinion.

18

MR. MINEAR:

That's absolutely right, and I

think that the point that you made is well taken that

there's a contradiction here.
