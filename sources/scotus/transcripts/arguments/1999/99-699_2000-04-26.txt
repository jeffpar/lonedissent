CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 99-699, Boy Scouts of America and Monmouth

5

Council v. James Dale.

Mr. Davidson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE A. DAVIDSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. DAVIDSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is about the freedom of a voluntary

12

association to choose its own leaders.

13

supreme court has held that the State and not Boy Scouting

14

may decide who will wear the Scout leader's uniform and

15

act as a role model of Scouting's values for a group of 10

16

to 15 boys in a Scout troop.

17

The New Jersey

Far from a business networking organization, Boy

18

Scouting is so closely identified with traditional moral

19

values that the phrase, he's a real Boy Scout, has entered

20

the language.

21

QUESTION:

Do we take this case as one in which

22

Dale was terminated because of the reasonable likelihood

23

that he would use his position to advocate for his cause?

24
25

MR. DAVIDSON:

Your Honor, Mr. Dale had created

a reputation for himself by the newspaper article which

1

appeared, and which -- the reputation which would have

2

carried into the troop meeting and affected his ability to

3

be a role model to the youths in his troop.

4

QUESTION:

So if it were simply called to the

5

Scouts' attention that he was a very private person, but

6

had said to his family that he was a homosexual, that he

7

could still be terminated?

8

9

MR. DAVIDSON:

Well, as Mr. Dale alleges in his

complaint and reaffirmed in his summary judgment

10

affidavit, Scouting does not investigate the sexual

11

orientation of applicants and only excludes those that are

12

open about their sexual orientation.

13

had have been people that have been in the newspaper, or

14

have written a letter for Boy Scouts, were recruited as

15

testers by Act Up and that sort of thing, so the case,

16

Your Honor, as posited we haven't seen.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

The cases we have

Well, what is the position of the

Scouts in the case that I have posited?
MR. DAVIDSON:

Well, I would be prepared to

20

defend any decision they might make in that situation.

21

think that's their right under the Constitution --

22

QUESTION:

Is that on the grounds that from his

23

status a certain amount of advocacy is likely?

what I'm trying to get at.

4

Well, if a Boy Scout -- well, let's

5

just keep it at troop leaders for now.

6

simply said to other officials, not to the newspapers, not

7

in any public forum anywhere, I am a homosexual, would he

be excluded from his leadership position for that alone?
MR. DAVIDSON:

If a troop leader

If the -- whoever heard whatever

10

statement was made learned that the person intended to

11

engage in homosexual conduct felt that that was an

12

appropriate -QUESTION:

13

That wasn't my question.

I mean, you

14

may want to elaborate on that, but if he simply says, I am

15

a homosexual, would he be excluded from a leadership

16

position for that?
MR. DAVIDSON:

17

As I said in response to Justice

18

Kennedy's question, that precise question hasn't come up.

1

I believe that there would be the right to do that.
QUESTION:

20

But you're defending an expressive

21

policy, and that's one of the things that's confusing.

22

Are you saying the policy is don't ask, don't tell, or is

23

the policy, if you are gay you are not wlecome in the Boy

24

Scouts?

25

Which is it?
MR. DAVIDSON:

The policy is not to inquire.

Well, do we answer the --

5

QUESTION:

Well, where do we look, though, to

6

determine what the policy is, because it is a little

7

confusing, and let me add another question to the mix, and

8

maybe you can clarify for us where we look.

9

the heterosexual Scout leader who openly espouses the view

What about

10

that homosexuality is consistent with Scout law and oath,

11

and that it's not immoral?

12

MR. DAVIDSON:

13

QUESTION:

If a -

Now, what about that person, and

14

where do we look to see what the Boy Scout position is on

15

these things?

16

MR. DAVIDSON:

If that person were to advocate

17

that position through Scouting channels in an effort to

18

change policy, that would be permissible.

19

indicates in Mr. Bishop's affidavit and Mr. Kaye's

20

testimony, if such a person were to advocate the morality

21

of homosexual conduct to youth in the program, that person

22

would be excluded and, indeed, one of Mr. Dale's affiants

23

was excluded on that ground.

25

QUESTION:

As the record

saying, Mr. Davidson, that perhaps the Scouts have not

1

adopted a comprehensive policy covering every single

2

conceivable situation that might come up.
MR. DAVIDSON:

3

Mr. Chief Justice, the Scouts

4

have general moral principles in the morally straight and

5

clean requirements of the oath and law, and they have to

6

be interpreted by Scout leaders in situations as they have

7

come up and certainly, in the case of those who have --

8

Mr. Dale has alleged are openly homosexual are not

9

permitted to be Scout leaders, in furtherance of the

10

efforts to pursue those moral values in youth.
QUESTION:

11

So you want us to decide this case

12

without reference to the likelihood of any public

13

advocacy?

14

we decide this case, in your view?

15

It's just not necessary for us to address when

MR. DAVIDSON:

Certainly not in Mr. Dale's case,

16

who has really constantly reiterated his intention and

17

desire to be open, and has had considerable media

18

attention both before the case was filed and subsequently.

ask.

But you don't find that a necessary

MR. DAVIDSON:

I'm saying that the First

Amendment would protect application of exclusion of other

people in other circumstances, but they're not presented

here today.

QUESTION:

1

When you -- I'm not sure what we're

2

talking about when we say exclusion of people who are not

3

openly homosexual.

4

in the sense of having a sexual orientation in that

5

direction but does not engage in any homosexual conduct?

I mean, what if someone is homosexual

MR. DAVIDSON:

6

Well, if that person also were to

7

take the view that the reason they didn't engage in that

8

conduct would it would be morally wrong -QUESTION:

9

MR. DAVIDSON:

10
11

Right.
-- and that's the view that would

be communicated to youth, that case has not come up, but

2

it's my understanding of the policy that that person would

3

not be excluded.

4

QUESTION:

But somebody who was homosexual and

5

celibate, but who said, in my view it isn't morally wrong,

6

would such a person be excluded?

7

MR. DAVIDSON:

Justice Ginsburg, I'm not sure I

8

got the nots right in that question, but if somebody said

9

it was morally wrong, and that they didn't engage in it

20

but did have homosexual inclinations, I believe that that

21

person would be eligible for leadership, as I understand

22

the policy.

status of being gay or being candid about who you are

People who live together,

heterosexual behavior which Boy Scouts has not regarded as

morally straight who have been excluded.

heterosexual conduct which is not regarded as morally

straight has resulted in the termination of leadership

positions, or not welcoming someone into leadership in the

first place.

14

QUESTION:

Is it fair to say, then, that anyone

profession of that fact would be likely to come to the

attention of the Boy Scouts themselves, be excluded?

QUESTION:

8

This is a statement

Is it -- and I take it -- we may have

touched on this, but I take it that the position that

you've just described is not stated anywhere in a Boy

Scouts manual, or even a troop leader manual?

and that's the way the policy is expressed, is that

correct?

MR. DAVIDSON:

This is in

It's determined by

Well, the record shows, although

17

the actual article is not in the record, that in the

18

magazine sent to all adult Scouters in 1992 there was an

19

article about the policy, so it's not a stealth policy,

20

but the general principle of morally straight is really

21

very, very widely known in the Scouting movement.

22

QUESTION:

It's --

The general principle is, but this

23

particular application of the Scouts' view of the

24

principle I take it is not stated in any official manual,

MR. DAVIDSON:

Well, in Mr. Dale's

that speaks disapprovingly of homosexual conduct, but

-- I take it you've just touched on

something that I think -- again, I think I understand your

It's not the

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, clarify for me,

11

because I -- it is not clear to me yet.

12

male adult who wants to be a Scout leader who openly

13

espouses the view that homosexuality is not immoral, and

14

that it is consistent with Scout law and oath, is that

15

person qualified for membership as a troop leader?

MR. DAVIDSON:

A heterosexual

That person could take that

17

position in Scouting Councils to urge that a change be

18

made, but if that -- unless that person were willing to --

19

if that person were to take that position to the youth in

20

the program and urge it on the youth in the program, that

21

person would not be able to continue as a Scout leader,

22

and that's why Mr. Rice was terminated.

QUESTION:

How about if he alleged in the

-- Scouts to terminate that

I can't cite a case that that's

Did anything happen here, other than

what's in the complaint, which I take it was that Mr.

10

Dale, sometime in the past, was a member of the Gay

11

Alliance at a university, gave some seminars, was

12

interviewed then, and it was in the newspaper.

13

received a letter of termination.

14

MR. DAVIDSON:

15

Right.

Then he

He was then and there the

copresident of Rutger's Gay and Lesbian Group.

16

QUESTION:

All right, yes, but there's nothing

17

other than that, and when you use the word open, that's

18

what open refers to, is talking to the newspaper reporter

19

about his previous membership in the Gay Alliance?

the Gay Alliance at the time he was -- yes.

MR. DAVIDSON:

QUESTION:

MR. DAVIDSON:

6

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice Breyer.

And that's it.
That's --

It's on the basis of that that he's

terminated, and when you use the word open, you're

8

referring to that?
MR. DAVIDSON:

9

QUESTION:

10

Right.

All right.

And now, if a similar

11

person had said every word exactly the same, but he was

12

not gay, and it was -- would he be terminated?

MR. DAVIDSON:

Well, it would be open to Scouts

to make that determination, and it's also open to Scouts

QUESTION:

Well, of course, it's always open to

7

the Scouts to decide whom they're going to hire and not,

identical were that person not gay?

would be open to the Scouts to conclude that somebody who

2

is himself presenting a personal example, as well as

3

advocating, might be more unacceptable than somebody who

4

was merely advocating.

5

QUESTION:

I want you to proceed with the rest

6

of your argument, but in answer to Justice Souter's

7

question as to what documents, what about the 1978

8

memorandum, I think it was, that's quoted in the

9

California supreme court case, which is a question and

10

answer format, in which a high executive of the Scouts, I

11

had thought, indicates that homosexuality in its troop

12

leaders is incompatible with Scouting?

13

that in your answer to Justice Souter, and --

MR. DAVIDSON:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

You didn't give

Well --

-- it seemed to me that that was a

rather strong statement.
MR. DAVIDSON: There are several position

18

statements, of which that's the first, to the effect that

19

Scouting does not appoint avowedly homosexual leaders.

20

Whether the word avowedly is used in each statement or

21

not, the policy is not to ask, so it only comes up when a

22

person is wearing it on their sleeve.

QUESTION:

Here, we have a moral code, which

May I ask right there, is it the

11

position that a person who is a homosexual, engages in

12

homosexual conduct, cannot fit that definition?

13

MR. DAVIDSON:

14

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

May I ask also whether it makes any

15

difference in the balance that the Court strikes that the

16

Scouts are a federally chartered institution and that

17

Government entities such as schools and fire departments

18

and police departments and so on sponsor troop units?

19

Does that make a difference, particularly if the

20

governmental unit itself takes the position that it would

21

disagree with this determination that the Boy --

MR. DAVIDSON:

Let me answer both of those

As to the Federal charter, virtually

in the Gay Olympic Games case, San Francisco Arts and

private character.

With respect to Government sponsorship,

5

everybody who sponsors a Scout troop signs on to follow

6

Scouting's values and procedures.

7

legal reasons, they shouldn't be doing that, their remedy

8

is to not continue to support Scouting.

QUESTION:

If, for political or

Well, I must say, I found it somewhat

10

difficult to assess the relevance of this web of relations

11

that the Boy Scouts have in New Jersey with schools and

12

fire departments.

3
4

I'm puzzled about what weight, if any,

to give to that.
If you prevail on your First Amendment argument

5

here, and you prevail in this case, do you think the

6

schools and the fire departments (a) would be permitted,

7

or (b) required, under New Jersey law, to sever their

8

relations with the Scouts?

9

MR. DAVIDSON:

Well, with respect to the -- we

20

have governments that are begging Scouting to go into

2

Cabrini Green housing projects, and to have cub packs at

22

women's prisons, but Scouting itself has pulled back

23

considerably from government, taking the Career Awareness

anything like that, so that many police and fire

2

departments are no longer sponsoring Scouting units,

3

because that's been moved over to Learning for Life.

4

But I'm not sure if Your Honor was based on, as

5

a matter of New Jersey law, or a matter of constitutional

6

law.
QUESTION:

7

Well, no one thinks that --or has

8

suggested that this makes you a State actor, so I think

9

the Fourteenth Amendment is out, but just as a matter of

10

New Jersey law it would seem to me that the schools and

11

the fire departments, to comply with the New Jersey law as

12

interpreted by the supreme court, would have to sever the

13

relation.

MR. DAVIDSON:

Perhaps I'm wrong.
Justice Kennedy, that may well

be.
QUESTION:

Are they places of public

I don't know.

MR. DAVIDSON:

Anyway, your point is if Government

MR. DAVIDSON:

1

Right.

The Scouts have said many

2

times that their policies are not for sale, and if it

costs the sponsorship, well that's -- so be it.
QUESTION:

4

May I ask one follow-up question to

5

the one I asked before -- if homosexual conduct violates

6

the Scout code, being straight and so forth, why is it

relevant whether the man is open or not?
MR. DAVIDSON:

Well, in two respects.

First, if

nobody knows about it, it doesn't become an issue.
QUESTION:

10

But assume the Scouts find out about

11

a person but he hasn't -- he just unwittingly let them

12

find out, not intending to.
MR. DAVIDSON:

If it becomes known to the

Scouts, the person would not be an appropriate role model

and presumably would not be permitted to continue.

out about it.

MR. DAVIDSON:

The right is that of

QUESTION:

But there were some briefs that

The chapters -- troops had been open about that,
and yet their charters hadn't been revoked.
MR. DAVIDSON:

Is that so?

There's some reference to troop

We

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice Breyer.

All right.

How are we supposed to

know -- and this is genuinely bothering me.

7

how are we supposed to know whether the basic principle

that the Scouts is operating on is thinking that this is

very, very bad conduct, or is simply being quite concerned

11
12

I don't --

about public reaction?
I mean, if it were very, very bad conduct, it's
surprising you don't look into it, but if what you're

concerned about is public reaction, it all makes quite a

lot of sense.

does not expressly address the problem of ax murderers or

But we're at a point where this has become a

fairly serious issue for the Scouts.

You've had a lot of

8

litigation on it, and here you are in the Supreme Court of

9

the United States, and shouldn't we -- or maybe we

shouldn't -- find some significance in the fact that the

Scouts have not officially addressed this in any of their

MR. WOLFSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The State of New Jersey has a neutral civil

rights law of general applicability that is aimed at

16

discriminatory practices, not expression.

17

protects gay and nongay people within New Jersey against

MR. WOLFSON:

Justice O'Connor --

QUESTION:

6

MR. WOLFSON:

7

Actually, that would not follow,

Why not?
-- for several reasons.

First of

all, because --

8

QUESTION:

Isn't that a status?

9

MR. WOLFSON:

The New Jersey law itself, Your

10

Honor, specifically creates an exemption for those public

11

accommodations that are reasonably restricted, in the

12

statute's words, to single sex, and therefore the statute

13

itself recognizes that there may be instances in which an

14

organization that is nevertheless a public accommodation

15

does not fall within the sex proscription otherwise in the

16

statute.

17

QUESTION:

Yes, but if we accept your position

18

and New Jersey changes its law, New Jersey drops its

19

exemption, then, I take it, as Justice O'Connor suggested,

20

it would fall out that the Boy Scouts would have to admit

21

girls.

22

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, in that unlikely event,

23

Justice Souter, that they were to actually drop this

24

exception, which clearly is embedded in the law, that

25

would -- it still would not follow, and this Court

1

certainly need not reach that decision here today, because

2

even were an organization under that public accommodations

3

obligation, they would nevertheless then be able to make a

4

First Amendment argument with regard to the burden on

5

their expressive purposes and their ability to delivery

6

their message, and that would be the case that would then

7

be before the Court on whatever record exists there.

Well, they don't have an antigirl

And -They do not, and in fact --

And they're saying that they do

have -- however they may have expressed it, they do have

5

an antihomosexual expression message, so I suppose in the

6

case of the girl who wanted to be admitted their position

7

would be weaker than it is here.

8

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, actually, Your Honor,

there's far more in the record with regard to Boy Scouts'

2

But this is -- you are relying on

3

cases that involve exclusion of women, and there's a

4

certain irony in that you're relying on the Jaycees case

and the Rotary case, and this statute of New Jersey does

6

include sex, as well as sexual orientation, and I don't

7

even think New Jersey has said that the exception would

cover such an organization.
You're speculating that it might, but is the

best that you could come up with is that the Boy Scouts

12

What --

13

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, to answer your question,

14

Justice Ginsburg, the best I can come up with regard to

15

the admission of girls is that obviously that question is

16

not presented before this Court, and the statute itself,

17

and the legislature in enacting the statute, clearly

18

intended to proscribe sex discrimination of the kind

19

reflected in this Court's precedent, acknowledged in this

Court's precedents with regard to Jaycees and others,

21

acknowledged that nevertheless there may be some programs

restriction to single sex.

have to -- would be addressing the record here, which

shows an absence of any burden on Boy Scouts' ability to

convey or express any message with regard to sexual

5

orientation or homosexuality which the record reflects, in

6

fact, is not conveyed to youth members and is not conveyed

7

to any adult member or sponsoring organization or Scout

master to communicate to the youth, and that is the much

stronger record that supports our position here.

6

the context of a First Amendment claim be the same for a

7

purely private organization?

8

9

MR. WOLFSON:
Justice O'Connor.

Should it

I have two answers to that,

The first is that this Court has never

10

held that the State's important interest in eliminating

11

discrimination, as Roberts said, in the political,

12

econmomic, and cultural life, and opportunities that

13

present to people a matter of great importance to people,

14

is limited to the commercial sphere, and there are good

15

reasons why it should not be so limited.

16

My second answer would be that Your Honor in the

17

Jaycees case, as, obviously, you're aware, talked about

18

the importance of the significance when an association

19

chooses its market, but in your opinion and, I think,

20

correctly broadened beyond that, the choice of a market

21

does not only refer to a choice to enter the commercial

22

sphere, and this --

Chief Justice, that a compelling interest is required

13

here.

14

on the specific expressive purposes of the organization

15

seeking to exercise its burden of showing an exemption

16

from the statute, and then the Court, if necessary, would

17

proceed to weigh that against a State's interest, but

18

those need not be compelling.

We do not argue, Mr.

The first step in the analysis would be any burden

But to specifically answer your question, Mr.

20

Chief Justice, the determination as to what is entitled to

not the same compellingness, or significance of interest

QUESTION:

But wouldn't the State's interest be

2

weaker if we're talking about, say, ex-convicts being

3

discriminated against than it would about blacks being

4

discriminated against?

5

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, as this Court has clearly

6

acknowledged, for example, in the Romer case and in the

7

Hurley case, where it talked about the legitimacy and

8

appropriateness of State civil rights laws that include

9

sexual orientation discrimination within the cluster of

10
11

prohibited classifications, in Romer the Court -QUESTION:

Well, that doesn't really answer my

12

question at all.

13

be weaker if we were talking about ex-convicts.

14

I asked you if the State interest would

I think on this record it's

15

difficult to answer that question, Your Honor, except that

16

I would say that I think this Court would look to factors

17

like, for example, the history of discriminiation that has

18

disadvantaged people according to a particular

classification, and every court that is --

QUESTION:

1

Your answer to this line of

2

questioning seems to suppose a dichotomy between an entity

3

that's a public accommodation and an entity that has

4

expressive rights.

MR. WOLFSON:

5
6

Surely there can be both.
Oh, absolutely, Your Honor, as the

Jaycees case and others recognize.

7

QUESTION:

If that's so, then in your view a

8

Catholic organization has to admit Jews, a Jewish

9

organization has to admit Catholics, and you can't have --

10

I mean, there are many.

11

oh, I mean, I don't know if they do or not, but I mean, it

12

seems odd.

13

The B'nai B'rith has to have --

That's your view of the constitutional law?
MR. WOLFSON:

No, Your Honor.

The first step

14

that the court looks to is whether the organization is the

15

kind of organization that qualifies as a public

16

accommodation.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. WOLFSON:

19

QUESTION:

We don't look to that.
No, that's correct, Your Honor.

So if the State of New Jersey were to

20

say our poublic accommodations law applies to the Knights

21

of Columbus, B'nai B'rith, every possible organization, if

22

they were to say that, look to that, what would we do as a

23

matter of constitutional law?

24
25

MR. WOLFSON:

The constitutional question that

would be before the Court in that case, as in this case,

is whether the organization has born its heavy burden of

2

winning an excuse from compliance with the law based on

3

its ability to show, as the Roberts and other cases make

4

clear, a specific expressive purpose that brings its

5

members together that is being significantly burdened by

6

the exercise -QUESTION:

7

Well, it need -- suppose that it says

8

this is basically a Jewish orgnaization, or this is

9

basically a Catholic organization.

MR. WOLFSON:

QUESTION:

12

Well --

And it is.

Suppose it is.

Then

what?
MR. WOLFSON:

13

Well, that may very well be the

14

kind of criterion that would have taken it out of being a

15

public --

16

QUESTION:

Fine.

If that's so, if that's what

17

we're supposed to do, then how are we supposed to

18

determine, in your opinion, whether or not the

19

relationship of the antigay to the Boy Scouts is or is not

20

fundamental, or core, in the way that the -- in the way

21

that I've just described in respect to other

22

organizations?

23

MR. WOLFSON:

Right.

There are two ways that I

24

would answer that question, Justice Breyer.

25

to say that the approach set forth in the Roberts trilogy,

The first is

1

in the cases in which these same kinds of claims have been

2

assessed, is that the Court looks first for that specific

3

expressive purpose that brings the members together, not

4

simply the views that some may happen to hold, and not

5

simply a policy or a practice of discrimination.

of course, present in every case.

what I don't understand.
I mean, is there any doubt that one of the

that it be speech.

I think our law simply prevents the

2

State from diluting or imperiling the message that an

3

organizaiton wants to convey, whether the State does it by

4

speech, or whether the State does it by dropping a bomb.

5

It seems to me that's what's going on here.
MR. WOLFSON:

6

Well, no.

What's going on here,

7

with respect, Justice Scalia, is that the BSA bears the

8

obligation of showing that it needs a First Amendment

9

shield to excuse it from this neutral law, content-neutral

10

law.

That's what the right protects.

Well, are you saying, Mr. Wolfson,

that it has to be a definite expressive purpose?

MR. WOLFSON:

Yes.

Which is also guaranteed by the First

Amendment.

MR. WOLFSON:

That's correct, Your Honor, as an

6

instrumental right in furtherance of the expression of the

7

members.
QUESTION:

8

Well, now, I don't -- what's your

authority for saying that freedom of association is simply
10

an instrumental right to further expression of the

11

members?

12

MR. WOLFSON:

That was the statement of this

13

Court in Jaycees, for example, Your Honor.

14

declined, Mr. Chief Justice, to recognize some kind of

15

free-floating of freedom to disassociation that can be

16

exercised in the absence of some kind of expressive

17

purpose as a defense against civil rights laws, for that

18

would swallow civil rights laws, and that's what this

Court held in the Jaycees case and others.

1

QUESTION:

And in almost all of your answers it

2

seems to me that you say once there is a public

secondary, or somehow must be subordinated.

5

cannot find that proposition in our cases.

6

MR. WOLFSON:

You simply

I totally agree, Justice Kennedy.

7

I'm certainly not arguing that at all.

8

that this Court has held that the creation and

9

implementation of public accommodations laws fulfilling

10

those important interests is a legitimate and important

11

exercise of a State's power, and what is at issue here,

12

Justice Kennedy, then is, has this organization shown that

13

for its First Amendment expressive purposes there is a

14

burden on its ability to convey its messages warranting

15

excusal from that law.

16

What I'm saying is

Of course, the First Amendment would trump the

17

public accommodations law in such a setting, but this

18

Court has made it very clear that it will not simply allow

19

the mere statement, we don't want to comply with the civil

20

rights law, to be the exception that defeats the civil

21

rights law.

QUESTION:

All right.

This is

But beyond that, Justice Ginsburg, this Court

need not even come to that point, and this is what I was

9

starting to want to continue with with Justice Souter,

10

which is that even were you to assume that they have the

11

implicit moral they say they have, what they have failed

12

to show is that their expressive messages, that their

13

activities are burdened, and that they -- and they further

14

have to be able to show --

15

QUESTION:

Well, if they assume that they make

16

their message not implicit, as you characterized it, but

17

explicit in the way that I suggested in my hypothetical,

18

is there not then a message which would clearly be

19

burdened by having avowedly homosexual people in

Then that would go the point

participate -QUESTION:

3

Oh, and that might be a very good

4

argument in that eventuality, but I take it that the fact

5

of their having made the message explicit would entitle

6

them to make a claim which you think they're not entitled

7

to make here, and that is that they have a message which

8

is quite clearly being burdened by avowedly homosexual

9

people in leadership positions, and your argument then

10

would be, well, you're not consistent about objecting to

11

the burden, but they would be able to make a burden

12

argument which, as I understand it, you think on this

13

record is illegitimate, is that correct?
MR. WOLFSON:

14

It would be correct they would

15

then have a stronger showing of an expressive message, but

16

that is only one piece of what they need to show -QUESTION:

17

Yes, and -- but doesn't it fall that

18

if their message is clear, the burden upon the message, by

19

putting an avowedly homosexual person in a leadership

position, would be burdened in a way that they cannot, on

21

your view, show it would -- a message would be burdened

So if this is the basis on which you

prevail, what you will have succeeded in doing is inducing

10

the Boy Scouts of America to be more openly and avowedly

opposed to homosexual conduct in all of its publications.

12

Is that what this case is all about?

13

MR. WOLFSON:

Actually, Justice Scalia, there is

14

most likely a reason why they have not -- why they in fact

concede in their own brief that they are not an antigay

teach anything about sexual orientation --

You insist that they go further and

MR. WOLFSON:

It's their burden, Justice Scalia,

4

to show that their specific expressive purposes, not

5

simply views they hold implicitly, but the expressive

purposes of conveying any such views, are significantly

burdened, and then that those outweigh the State's

interest in this neutral law.

The State --

How do we do that?

That is, I'm back

to Justice Scalia's earlier question, and the Chief's.

Well, in the unlikely event that

22

it were a public accommodation, which it would not be,

23

then what we also have operating with religion, and

24

perhaps this goes to your question, Justice Breyer, is

25

that that's addressing people on the basis of views.

It's

1

addressing people on the basis of message and expression.

2

It is not the identity-based discrimination.

3

QUESTION:

My question was -- maybe we don't

4

agree on the assumption -- that if there are some groups,

5

say religiously oriented groups that could keep out people

6

of the other religion --

7

QUESTION:

MR. WOLFSON:

Yes.

-- that on the other hand if you take

8

these basic organizing principles and push them to the

9

periphery, so that now they're only a peripheral

10

principle, and you accept that, you could submerge all

11

civil rights laws?

You said that at one point.

In other words, if you take what is a basic

12

13

principle, and say the same law applies if it's just a

14

secondary or tertiary or sort of peripheral principle, if

15

we accept that as an excuse, there will be no civil rights

16

laws left.

17

MR. WOLFSON:

18

QUESTION:

Certainly, if --

All right.

Fine.

If -- so I thought

19

we were agreeing about those two things, and then I wanted

20

to know what the Court is supposed to do to figure out

21

when an association claims that a principle is very

22

important, whether it is really central, or whether it is

23

one of these things that you call peripheral, or tertiary,

24

that it would submerge the civil rights laws.

25

supposed to -- how are we supposed to find that out?

Are we

1

MR. WOLFSON:

With respect, Justice Breyer, I

2

don't know that it turns on centrality so much as it turns

3

on, in the words of the Court in the Roberts trilogy,

4

specific expressive purpose, and the things that this

5

Court would look to are, in the threshold inquiry would

6

look to what does the record show with regard to purposes

7

that bring the members together?

8

What are they saying?

9

Who are the members?

What are they stating?

In the case here we have the amici, who clearly

10

do not agree, and who constitute a huge share, not to

11

mention the public entities, of the sponsors and members

12

and participants of this organization.

13

But my further argument is that even where you

14

assume arguendo that they have this implicit moral view,

15

what the record clearly shows here is that they do not

16

require any Scout master or sponsoring entity or whatever

17

to convey that to youth, and in that case it's an easy

18

determination for this Court to see that there's no burden

19

on this conveying of expressive message central, specific

20

or otherwise, because they themselves do not convey it.

21

They themselves don't do it, and therefore these --

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Wolfson, there seems to be some

23

conflict on that point, because I believe counsel for the

24

Boy Scouts told us -- he referred us to a page in the

25

record that that one troop -- its charter was continued

1

only when it agreed that it was going to have -- adhere to

2

this policy, and that it wasn't going to advocate gays are

3

okay.
MR. WOLFSON:

4

But Mr. Dale is not here to

5

advocate that he be allowed to advocate that gays are okay

6

within Scouting, nor does New Jersey tell the Boy Scouts

7

what they can or can't say within Scouting, nor does it

8

tell them that they can't limit what is said within

9

Scouting.

What it tells them is, identity-based

10

discrimination, the equation of a human being with forced

11

speech, or a speech, or an assumed message, is off the

12

table.

13

QUESTION:

But of course, they're saying that

14

it's not merely identity-based discrimination.

15

saying it's advocacy-based, that by making the public

16

statements that he has made, he in effect has put himself

17

in a position of being identified, understood by people as

18

an advocate, and therefore if he's in a leadership

19

position in the Scouts, by that very fact he's going to

20

carry sort of the aura of the advocacy with him.

21

How do you respond to that?

22

MR. WOLFSON:

They're

Well, in this specific case, Your

23

Honor, Mr. Dale was expelled for taking part in a seminar

24

outside of Scouting, in which he made no connection to

25

Scouting, in which he asserted a view that, as questions

have indicated, had nongay people asserted them, would

2

have been perfectly fine and they would be entitled to

3

remain in Scouting.

4

QUESTION:

Well, your opposing counsel I think

5

gave us an example of nongays who were taking that

6

position who were challenged by the Scouts and backed

7

down, so I don't know whether the differential treatment

8

is as clear as I thought when I came in here.
MR. WOLFSON:

9

Actually, Justice Souter, the

10

record is crystal clear with regard to all the amici, all

11

of the sponsoring organizations, from the United Methodist

12

Church to the Reform Jewish groups, to the public schools

13

and others, who make clear that their charter is renewed

14

year after year, despite their difference -- in fact,

15

their not even knowing that this was part of the alleged

16

expressive purpose that they were supposed to be

conveying, and --
