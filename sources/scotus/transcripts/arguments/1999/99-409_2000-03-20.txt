ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In the century preceding the enactment of the

12

Bankruptcy Code in 196 -- 1978, this Court and other

13

Federal courts recognized and enforced the rule that an

14

unpaid administrative claimant in a bankruptcy case can

15

come to court and have his or her claim paid if the

16

expense benefited the secured party.

17

The Federal courts also recognized the rule that

18

a trustee who pays a claim may come and seek to charge the

19

secured party's collateral if there was a benefit to the

20

secured party.

21

In enacting section 506 (c) of the Bankruptcy

22

Code, Congress recognized the right of the trustee, and

23

the issue before the Court today is whether Congress'

24

recognition of the right of the trustee was therefore

25

intended to abrogate the other pre-code practice, which is

1

that the administrative claimant could come to court and

2

have the claim paid.
QUESTION:

3

So you're simply arguing that if the

4

code says nothing, the pre-code practice applies,

5

notwithstanding something like 506 (c)?
MR. BRUNSTAD:

6

Yes, Your Honor.

As the Court

7

stated 2 years ago in the Cohen case, cited in our brief,

8

at 523 U.S. at 221, we will not read the Bankruptcy Code

9

to erode past bankruptcy practice absent a clear

10

indication that Congress intended such a departure.
QUESTION:

11

12

Well, here, Congress said the

trustee --

13

MR. BRUNSTAD:

14

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

-- can bring it, and it doesn't talk

15

about the creditor, so maybe that's a change.

16

it's pretty clear language.

17

MR. BRUNSTAD:

I mean,

Yes, it is, Your Honor, but I

18

think that the part that Congress recognized was the tip

19

of the iceberg.

20

case, which we cite in our brief, the rule which this

21

Court recognized was that the unpaid administrative

22

claimant could come forward and have the claim paid.

23

As this Court made clear in the Wilson

Now, we know under the Bankruptcy Code that

24

Congress will codify some of the equitable doctrines that

25

preceded its enactment, and yet this Court has recognized

MR. BRUNSTAD:

QUESTION:

8

MR. BRUNSTAD:

10
11

Actually, Your Honor, yes, my

client did.

7

9

Did your client ask the trustee to

Yes.
And the trustee's position was

that the trustee had no interest in this case and would
not pursue it.
QUESTION:

Could you have asked the judge to

12

instruct the trustee to exercise his discretion to collect

13

the -- to impose the surcharge?

14

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Yes, we could have asked the

15

Bankruptcy Court to do that, but we think that the -- it

16

would have been futile, because the trustee had no funds

17

whatsoever to engage in litigation with the secured party.

18

QUESTION:

So that it would have been abuse, an

19

abuse of discretion for the trustee to go ahead and seek

20

the surcharge?

21

MR. BRUNSTAD:

It would have been, Your Honor,

22

completely futile, plus I think Your Honor would have to

23

recognize in this case that the trustee having no interest

24

in recovery because the trustee had not paid the claim in

25

the first place, one could argue that the trustee having

1

no interest and no incentive and no ability, it simply

2

could not have happened.
QUESTION:

3

Did the trustee in your view in this

4

case have the discretion either to seek the surcharge or

5

not to seek the surcharge?
MR. BRUNSTAD:

6

Well, if the trustee had wanted

7

to do so for free, certainly the trustee could have

8

pursued the claim.
QUESTION:

9

Do you think, if you were the counsel

10

for the trustee, you would have told the trustee that he

11

has discretion not to pursue the surcharge?
MR. BRUNSTAD:

2

3

Yes, Your Honor, I would, because

the State of --

4

QUESTION:

So now we're in the position where

5

the code says, with its -- within the trustee's discretion

6

not to pursue the surcharge, and yet the creditor can

7

force it.

8
9

That seems a little odd to me.
MR. BRUNSTAD:

Well, Your Honor, our position is

not that the creditor can force the trustee to do it.

20

position is that the creditor can pursue the claim

21

directly.

22

QUESTION:

It still seems odd to me.

Our

If the

23

trustee has the discretion not to do so, for the creditor

24

to force it, it seems to me to be in effect controlling

25

the discretion of the trustee.

MR. BRUNSTAD:

1

I think perhaps, Your Honor, the

2

question here is not whether the trustee has discretion.

3

It would be whether the trustee has the ability.

4

case, the trustee having no funds to litigate with the

5

secured party simply could not pursue the claim.
QUESTION:

6

In this

If you had had a prior arrangement

7

with the trustee -- I don't know whether you did or not --

8

could an action be brought in State court on the basis of

9

representations?
MR. BRUNSTAD:

10
11

remedy here is a remedy under the bankruptcy laws.
QUESTION:

12

13

We think, Your Honor, that the

Yes, I didn't -- that's not the

question I asked you.

14

MR. BRUNSTAD:

15

QUESTION:

Okay.

I thought maybe the Eighth Circuit

16

had reserved the question of whether there was some right

17

you had to go into Federal court on diversity or State

18

law.

19

MR. BRUNSTAD:

I think, Your Honor, that the

20

Eighth Circuit, the en banc decision was merely saying

21

that the only question here is whether there is a question

22

under Federal law.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. BRUNSTAD:

25

What did the panel opinion say?
The panel opinion, Your Honor,

said that we had the right under section 506(c) .

There

was no mention of any alternative right.
QUESTION:

district court, or any other court?
MR. BRUNSTAD:

4
5

No, Your Honor, we had not.

QUESTION:

I'm curious about a prior question

about what 506(c) covers.
MR. BRUNSTAD:

8

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

The text of 506(c) says the trustee

10

may recover from property securing an allowed secured

11

claim the reasonable, necessary costs and expenses of

12

preserving or disposing of such property, and I think

13

we're dealing here with Workman's Comp --

14

MR. BRUNSTAD:

15

QUESTION:

16

Yes, Your Honor.

-- premiums that were incurred after

the original Chapter 11 proceeding was begun --

17

MR. BRUNSTAD:

18

QUESTION:

Correct.

-- in an attempt to keep the business

going.

expense of preserving the real property, did it?

This

is the exclusive means of recovery which we are --

Had you brought any claims in the

It didn't have anything to do with a cost and

MR. BRUNSTAD:

It did, Your Honor.

In this case

22

the assets in question were operating businesses -- gas

23

stations, restaurants -- and in order to operate those

24

businesses the debtor had to have Worker's Comp insurance

25

or it could not operate at all, so but for the provision

1

of the insurance there would have been no operation.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. --

3

QUESTION:

Yes, but if they operate at a loss,

4

that's not much of a benefit to the secured creditor.

5

That's the whole problem, is these people have been

6

operating.

7
8

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Well, Your Honor, I think that

the difference is that between liquidation value and going
concern value of the gas station.

10

QUESTION:

Well, put it this way.

I'm not

11

sure -- I mean, if your client had been hired to go paint

12

the building, or to repair the plumbing, I can understand

13

how it would fit under 506(c), but to incur an expense for

14

paying these premiums for Workman's Comp to run the

15

business, as opposed to actually enhancing the real

16

property or the building, I'm not sure I see how it fits

17

under 506 at all --

MR. BRUNSTAD:

1

There is no dispute, Your Honor,

2

that our claim was allowed as a proper administrative

3

expense.

4

QUESTION:

But you just want to go now against

5

the real property because that's the only thing there is,

6

I guess.

7

MR. BRUNSTAD:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. BRUNSTAD:

10

QUESTION:

Correct.

506(c) articulates --

Yes.
-- a priority for certain claims.

Okay, but why doesn't it -- isn't it

11

limited to something that actually enhances the property

12

as opposed to the broader 503 claim?

13

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Your Honor, in this case it's

14

undisputed that our claim provided a benefit to the

15

secured party, and the reason that it did was because the

16

value which the bank realized from the sale of these

17

businesses as a going concern was actually much greater

18

than the value that they would have received if the gas

19

station had shut down.

20

Picture the storage tanks under a gas station

21

which is not operating or generating revenue.

Typically,

22

those operations sell for very little money.

If, however,

23

you have an operating store, and some of these stores are,

24

in fact, still operating, but with different owners, the

25

value is much more, so the bank got the benefit of the

1

difference in value because the debtor was able to operate

2

in a going concern value and those values were preserved.

3

That is, of course, one of the purposes of Chapter 11.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Brunstad, I have --

5

QUESTION:

Who can speak to engage a client such

6

as yours to continue?

7

have an arrangement with the trustee?
MR. BRUNSTAD:

8

9

Is it the trustee?

Do you have to

Well, I think Your Honor should

understand that the trustee and creditors are adversaries,

10

and that it would not be -- it would be unseemly in the

11

least for a creditor, who is adversary to a trustee, to

12

have to hire the adversary to pursue the creditor's

13

claims.

14

QUESTION:

Yes, but in the first place, after

15

bankruptcy, who authorizes your client to continue paying

16

for Workman's Compensation?

17

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Oh, I see.

Well, in this case,

18

Your Honor, our client did not even know of the

19

bankruptcy.

20

we've continued to provide the services without knowledge

21

of the bankruptcy.

QUESTION:

Without any authorization from the

trustee?

What happens is that when the debtor, who

incur expenses which will be ultimately classified as
administrative expenses?
MR. BRUNSTAD:

11

Yes, Your Honor, and that --

expenses that are incurred in the ordinary course, the

13

debtor is authorized by statute to continue to incur those

14

expenses, and in this case what we have, Your Honor, is an

involuntary creditor.

have the requirement to continue to provide the coverage?

8

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

But you seek for some 6 or 7 months,

am I right?

17

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Yes, Your Honor, but what

18

happened during that period of time was that initially a

19

part of the premium was paid when the application for the

20

insurance was submitted, so that was covered for a period

21

of time.

going to be at risk, put up the whole thing in front?
MR. BRUNSTAD:

If we had known about the Chapter

3

11, perhaps we could have done that, but we did not know,

4

Your Honor.

5

QUESTION:

As soon as you found out about it,

6

couldn't you say, at this point we stop until you pay the

7

premium in advance?

8

MR. BRUNSTAD:

We did not find out until after

the policy was terminated, Your Honor.
10

QUESTION:

How does that relate to your argument

11

that you were required to provide insurance anyway because

12

this individual, or the company would have been within the

13

assigned risk pool?

14

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Your Honor, what happened was

15

that they tendered their application with part of the

16

premium, and then the -- a period of time went by.

17

Premiums are calculated on an audit basis, meaning the

18

debtor has to submit their payroll reports to the insurer.

1

Then the insurer calculates the premiums based upon the

20

number of persons who are employed times a certain rate.

21

The debtor in this case neglected to send those

22

monthly reports, so Hartford sent an auditor in.

23

auditor conducted the audit, went back to Hartford,

24

Hartford calculated the premium and then sent a demand to

25

the debtor.

The debtor paid part of the premium.

Now, all of this took a lot of time to happen.

1

2

After the debtor paid a part of the premium, the second

3

installment, in addition to the one that was with the

4

initial application, it was not enough to carry through

5

the term, but by the time the Hartford went and said, you

6

haven't paid the full amount, we were 30 days away from

7

the termination of the policy, so it was too late to

8

cancel.

9

QUESTION:

So all you're saying is, we had to

10

start insuring.

When we could stop insuring was in fact a

11

complex function of the audit.

12

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Correct, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION:

Okay.

14

QUESTION:

Could I ask you about section 506,

15

which is on page 2 of your brief?

16

MR. BRUNSTAD:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

It says the trustee may recover

18

necessary costs and expenses of preserving or disposing.

19

Now, I assume that he can't recover them until they've

20

been expended.

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Isn't it also a reasonable reading of

it that he can't recover them unless he has expended them?

Well, but that's not the position

you're taking.

have assumed that the trustee could sue to recover money

that he didn't expend but that you expended.
MR. BRUNSTAD:

11
12

In response to other questions here, you

I think that the best reading of

the statute, Your Honor, on its plain meaning, is that the

3

trustee, when the trustee expends, then the trustee

4

recovers.

5

QUESTION:

Right.

6

MR. BRUNSTAD:

But under prior practice, that

was not necessarily the rule.

trustees could recover whether they expended or not, and

Your Honor, that the trustee paid the expense first, and

that presupposes the trustee had funds, unencumbered funds

It is the logical situation, the

gap?

The Poznan case was an admiralty

That doesn't show a very solid pre­

code practice.
MR. BRUNSTAD:

7

Well, Your Honor,

the case which

8

we rely on from this Court, the Wilson case,

9

clearly addressed the specific problem and provided the

10

I think quite

specific solution that we're seeking.
In the lower court decisions, as the bankruptcy

11
12

laws evolved up to the point of the Bankruptcy Code, those

13

courts relied on Wilson for the proposition that the

14

administrative claimant has the right to come to the court

15

and have its claim paid when it has not been paid, and one

16

of the cases that we cite in our brief is a case

17

involving -- bear with me for one minute, Your Honor.

18

It is the Louisville case, Louisville Storage

19

Company case, 21 F.Supp. at 897, where the Court, citing

20

Wilson,

21

in general principles of equity, that the lienholder must

22

bear the expense of bankruptcy administration, which is

23

solely for his benefit, or to which he consents, or to

24

which he causes,

unpaid administrative claimant to come forward and have

2

their claim paid.

3
4

So Wilson is the lodestar, in a sense, and the
lower Federal courts followed it.

5

QUESTION:

Yes, but you're relying on one rather

6

old Supreme Court decision and some lower court decisions

7

following it up.

8

very strong peg for claiming this understood pre-code

9

practice.

I'm just suggesting that that is not a

MR. BRUNSTAD:

10

Well, Your Honor, it was uniform.

11

There were no opinions to the contrary, and the -- this

12

practice, I would submit, Your Honor, is more established

13

than the pre-code practice which this Court was willing to

14

accept in Midlantic for the proposition that a trustee's

15

power to abandon carries with it the corollary that the

16

trustee cannot abandon in violation of certain health and

17

safety requirements under applicable State law.

18

QUESTION:

Well, isn't it possible Congress

19

might have wanted to change this, figuring that what you

20

describe as pre-code practice would attract a certain

21

amount of leeches who wanted to get at the secured

22

property?

23

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Well, Your Honor, the rule, I

24

think, is one which initially five courts of appeals, and

25

the Eighth Circuit changed its mind, had adopted and the

courts had no ability administering.

2

there's any evidence, Your Honor, that Congress intended

3

to change the practice.

4

I don't think

In fact, the only evidence in the legislative

5

history is that Congress intended to maintain the status

6

quo, so there's no -- there being no evidence of an intent

7

to change, the presumption, I think, is that, and properly

8

so, given the nature of what we're talking about, the

9

bankruptcy laws, that the pre-code practice endures.

10

QUESTION:

If the trustee chose to seek these

11

funds to surcharge the property and, either by an

12

accounting entry or by the actual receipt of cash,

13

received $25,000, would that be paid 100 percent to you,

14

or could the trustee say, well now, I have my own

administrative expenses, too, and other, and there are

other administrative -- how does that work?

MR. BRUNSTAD:

If the trustee has paid the claim

18

from unencumbered funds of the estate, and the trustee

19

then seeks to recover it from the secured party's

20

collateral, and the trustee is basically replenishing the

7

QUESTION:

There is no contrary-

Yes, but it's -- Midlantic is talking

8

about, they're codifying something and you can tell from

the language of the section that they're codifying it.

10

You can't tell from 506(c) that they're codifying anything

11

as broad as you say, it seems to me.
MR. BRUNSTAD:

12

Well, Your Honor, the bankruptcy

13

codifies in section 553 rights of set-off.

14

nothing about rights of recoupment, yet in bankruptcy that

15

was an established right and this Court in Ritter v.

bankruptcy, so this Court in construing the bankruptcy

come, which is inextricably intertwined with the right of

2

the trustee.

3

The general principle is the same.

I think it's important to emphasize that

4

bankruptcy proceedings are in rem, and that the bankruptcy

5

court, as this Court made clear in the Adair case, that it

6

is the responsibility of the court, the bankruptcy court

7

to see to it that the in rem assets, which are in custodia

8

legis, are, in fact, distributed properly.
QUESTION:

Yes, but that's a general statement

10

that really I don't see -- how does that aid you in this

11

particular case, when you're talking about 506(c)?

12

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Because Adair is the case, Your

13

Honor, which articulated the rule which we're relying on

14

here, the general rule that the administrative expenses

15

must be paid out of the secured party's collateral to the

16

extent of the benefit and the court -- it would I think

17

be -- lead to an absurd result to say that if the trustee

18

doesn't come to court, that the bankruptcy court has no

1

authority to allocate the charges properly, and if the

20

bankruptcy court has authority to do so, any party in

21

interest in the case should be able to come to court to

22

say to the court, this is how it must be done.

23

QUESTION:

Well, that would be all the more so

24

if you interpreted 506(c) as allowing the trustee to

25

recover only those expenses that he has paid.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. BROWNLEE

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. BROWNLEE:

Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice,

may it please the Court:
I don't know if it would make any difference in
the Justices' rulings, but I'd like to -- my friend and

10

colleague Mr. Brunstad misspoke on a couple of questions,

11

one I believe by Justice Kennedy.

12

that, because I think it was the first question in the

13

argument, where Hartford indicated it had asked the

14

trustee to proceed and the trustee had refused.

15

I may be wrong about

In the blue brief at page 5, note 4, it is

16

stated, Hartford did not request the trustee to pursue its

17

claim under section 506(c) because the law in the Eighth

18

Circuit as it existed at that time permitted

19

administrative claimants to pursue such claims on their

20

own behalf, citing the Boatmen's case, which was overruled

21

by the Eighth Circuit.

22

In fact, not even that is really so.

When the

23

Boatmen's case was decided, the one that was overruled in

24

this case, the issue was at contest in the Hartford v.

25

Magna case, Magna being the predecessor of my client, so I

believe Mr. Brunstad misspoke in response to the answer to

2

that question.
QUESTION:

3

Well, how could Hartford have avoided

4

losing its claim here, do you think, if there was

5

something that was obtained when the business was sold as

6

an ongoing business, and assuming that the Workman's Comp

7

insurance somehow benefited the property?
MR. BROWNLEE:

8

Justice O'Connor, Hartford's

policies were such in this case -- you can look at the
10

record below -- that it did not know that it was insuring

11

a debtor for a period of some 15 months or so.
The one thing Hartford could have done, I

12

13

believe, although I don't intend to tell them how to run

14

their business in any -- and I don't mean this in any way

15

derogatorily or in a pejorative manner -- would have been

16

to have some procedures in place so that they would have

17

known, even though the debtor -- I have no evidence that

18

the debtor did notify them.

1

been somewhat creditor emptor, and it is true in this case

20

that there's no evidence that Hartford was actually

21

notified.

Bankruptcy is and always has

There is evidence in this case on the record

22

23

below that Hartford knew that it had a series of quarterly

24

bills that were going unpaid, and so it couldn't have

25

found out.

Had Hartford known earlier, before the case

1

was converted to a 7, and before the case was in a total

2

liquidation mode, Hartford could have come to court,

3

Hartford could have asked to terminate the policy based on

4

nonpayment, at least cut its losses, and also Hartford

5

could have tried to take steps to persuade the bankruptcy

6

court perhaps while there were still funds in the estate

7

to allow it within an administrative claim and force the

8

payment of that claim.

9

Bankruptcy has a lot to do with timing,

10

especially in a reorganization case that's going downhill.

11

Hartford in fact is correct that it did not know until

12

substantially later.

13

could Hartford have protected itself after the fact, once

14

we got to March of 1993, or whatever the record will show

15

the date was that it learned, Hartford cannot protect

16

itself under 506(c), I submit.

17

18

QUESTION:

If the Justice's question is, how

506(c) says the trustee

Well, what happens in -- I don't know

19

that that Meyer case really answers the question, but what

20

happens in the case of a pre-petition, a pre-petition

21

debtor, the pre-petition debtor has a giant claim against

22

General Motors, a lawsuit --

Now, Meyer dealt with the case of the debtor

having filed the suit, not a creditor.

4

as authority for the creditor.

5

the case that creditors in such circumstances simply go

6

and bring their own lawsuits in the name of the estate

7

instead of the trustee doing it?

8

MR. BROWNLEE:

9

It could be taken

So what happens?

Is it

Well, Justice Breyer, if I could

just observe first of all in the Meyer case, it's my

10

reading of the Meyer case that while the Court allowed the

11

principle of the second debtor to proceed with the

12

prefiled proof of claim in the first bankruptcy, it was

3

clear that any recovery would be on behalf of the estate,

4

which is not something that Hartford seeks here.

5

seeks a nonshare.

6

QUESTION:

Hartford

I know, but what I'm trying to do for

7

my own purposes is to find an analogy, and I know it's a

8

rough analogy, but I would like to know just for my own

9

purposes what happens, and it must happen often, of when a

trustee doesn't bring a lawsuit to get some money for the

21

estate, that a big creditor thinks he ought to bring.

If the trustee, who is clothed under 506 (c) with

11

the responsibility to pursue this right, this action to

12

obtain funds that were otherwise the property of the

3

secured creditor, either doesn't proceed in her own

behalf, or there isn't a court order that allows whatever

5

surrogate, Hartford or whomever, to proceed in the name of

the estate and on behalf of the estate, then you're going

I'm not aware of a statutory-

basis, Justice, for derivative standing.

3

QUESTION:

All right, but --

4

QUESTION:

I thought that in response to Justice

5

Breyer you said, now, you go to the trustee and the court,

6

and if the trustee doesn't want to do it, then you ask the

7

court for authority to do it on your own, but now you're

8

saying that a court doesn't have -- can't allow you to do

9

it.

10

MR. BROWNLEE:

The bankruptcy courts have

11

developed a body of law wherein they will -- some will

12

grant what is called derivative standing, and the cases

13

are cited in the briefs.

14

As a matter of fact, the best example of them is

15

in the amici for the petitioner, when the AIA and the

16

National Union suggests that even under the preference

17

section and the fraudulent conveyance sections, which also

18

start with the words, the trustee may recover, that there

19

are cases which have allowed third parties --

21

22

QUESTION:

Are those proper cases, and proper

holdings in your view?
MR. BROWNLEE:

Justice, I don't think -- I know

23

that this Court doesn't need to decide whether derivative

standing is appropriate on a Nation-wide basis for us to

win this case, because I don't think this Court should

2

trustee means anything other than trustee.

3

you should hold that it means -- because I don't think

4

there is any established pre-code practice and, if there

5

were, the statute is sufficiently clear.
QUESTION:

6

I don't think

It shouldn't --

Well, then I'm not sure why your

7

answer to Justice Breyer isn't that the Hartford goes to

the Court, it asks to order the trustee, if the court and

the trustee give no relief, there's nothing Hartford can

do.

MR. BROWNLEE:

Now, if that would be the legal

20

MR. BROWNLEE:

If you are in a district where a

judge will allow derivative standing in the name of the

trustee, that's correct, because 506(c) talks about an

action to recover by the trustee.

Anybody can ask for payment from the estate, but

2

503 talks about a direction to the estate to seek payment.

3

Creditors can't typically sue secured creditors as if they

4

could sue outside under State law, to go back to a

5

question you previously asked, Justice.
Within the bankruptcy, the Bankruptcy Code's --

6

7

I believe the Court's language in some cases in looking at

8

plain meaning has been a consistent and coherent scheme,

9

has been that creditors deal with the estate, and the

10

estate deals with creditors.
Hartford wants to deal with us.

11

They want to

12

call us outside, and they don't have any way to do that

13

except to make the argument that's made on the merits

14

briefs and partially made today, although there may have

15

been a shift in argument, that they can do it under

16

506 (c) .

17

Now, I would suggest to the Court that the

18

Congress was not totally unmindful when it adopted the

19

code of the possibility that inter -- that there might be

20

intercreditor fights under some circumstances, under some

21

hypotheticals.

in 510(c) , which is the equitable subordination section,
