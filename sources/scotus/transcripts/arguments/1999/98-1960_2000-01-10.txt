ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL H. BROMBERG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BROMBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents a question of statutory

11
12

interpretation, specifically whether the special venue

13

provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act are exclusive

14

and therefore preclude application of the general venue

15

statute to requests to confirm, correct, modify or correct

16

or vacate arbitration agreements.

17

As the vast majority of courts and commentators

18

to consider the question have concluded, the answer to the

19

question is no.

20

permissive in nature, and they supplement rather than

21

supplant the general venue statute.

22

supported by the permissive language of section 9 and the

23

lack of any restrictive language in sections 9, 10, and

24

11.

25

language is used, and also by the overall structure of the

The FAA's special venue provisions are

This conclusion is

It is supported by the context in which that

1

FAA.

It is independently supported as well by the -QUESTION:

2

Mr. Bromberg, do you think that the

3

word may in section 9, 10, and 11 must be interpreted the

4

same way?

5

10 and 11 mean, in effect, in the use of the word may?

Does section 9 mean exactly the same thing that

MR. BROMBERG:

6

No, Your Honor.

The reference in

7

section 9 is connected to an application for a

8

confirmation order.

9

not clearly connected to such an application because there

10

is no reference in 10 and 11 to an application.
What is important, though, is that section 9 is

11
12

In sections 10 and 11 the word may is

clearly a permissive provision.

13

QUESTION:

Well, it may be permissive only

14

because it's conditional.

15

is specified in the agreement of the parties, then such

16

application may be made to the United States court in and

17

for the district in which such award was made.

really wanted them to say, then such application must be

made?

correct as far as it pertains --

Now, you

QUESTION:

Surely you don't have to

Your Honor, I think that is

So wouldn't that explain the may?

It's a conditional may.

If no court is specified, then

such application may be made.
MR. BROMBERG:

2

Well, Your Honor, the word may

3

usually connotes discretion, and you're suggesting that

4

the discretion is to not bring an action.

QUESTION:

6

MR. BROMBERG:

7

Right.
That is a possible

interpretation.
QUESTION:

8

There you are.

There goes your may

argument.
MR. BROMBERG:

10
11

Well, Your Honor, this court has

interpreted may, of course, to indicate discretion.
QUESTION:

12

But isn't there one case that doesn't

do that?

14

were, may be had.

15

suits against national banks, and the court treated that

16

as an exclusive venue provision even though the words were

17

may be had.

18

Isn't it -- it's the Radzanower case.

The words

This was in reference to venue for

MR. BROMBERG:

Your Honor, that's correct,

1

Radzanower did apply prior decisions of this Court, but

20

the national bank provision I would suggest is very

21

different from the provision that is before this Court,

22

because it was clear that Congress had a purpose to

23

protect a particular party by limiting venue to a

24

particular district and it is, I think, important to note

25

that the provision at issue there, which of course has

1

since been superseded, dealt not only with venue in

2

Federal courts, but also with venue in State courts as

3

well.

The -QUESTION:

4

There's a curiosity about the

5

procedural history of this case, and I wonder if you could

6

address it, and that is, as I understand it, the circuit,

7

the Eleventh Circuit was relying on old Fifth Circuit

8

precedent, which was since changed in the Fifth Circuit,

9

is that right?

10

MR. BROMBERG:

11

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And so the panel was stuck, yet you

12

didn't ask for an en banc so the new Eleventh could

13

consider the question afresh in light of what the current

14

Fifth Circuit has held.

15

MR. BROMBERG:

Yes, Your Honor.

The panel had

16

held that the prior Fifth Circuit decision controlled, and

17

we did decide to file a petition for certiorari rather

18

than seeking a hearing en banc.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

Even though most of the circuits go

your way.
MR. BROMBERG:

Yes, Your Honor.

Five of the

22

circuits have gone -- have interpreted these venue

23

provisions to be permissive in clear holdings.

24

suggested that in dicta.

25

have adopted a restrictive interpretation.

1

Justice Scalia, to get back to your question, we

2

think that a permissive interpretation of the FAA's

3

special venue provisions is not only supported by the

4

language of these provisions, and although it may be

5

possible to read them otherwise we do think that the most

6

natural reading is a permission to use different venue

7

statutes, but you also have to look at the context in

8

which these provisions were enacted.

9

As we indicate on page 14 of our opening brief,

10

where Congress has intended special venue statutes to be

11

restrictive, it has frequently, though not always, used

12

explicitly mandatory or restrictive language.

13

permissive interpretation is consistent with the structure

14

of the Federal Arbitration Act.

15

interpretation is adopted, the Federal Arbitration Act

16

would not provide enforcement of arbitrations that are

17

conducted abroad.

18

Moreover,

If a restrictive

However, as this Court indicated in the Scherk

19

case, the FAA as originally enacted was intended to apply

20

to such arbitrations.

21

interpretation would create a gap in the venue created by

22

the statute.

23

QUESTION:

As a consequence, a restrictive

Can you tell me, is it always crystal

24

clear which district the award has been made in?

25

arbitrators meet in several different cities, and their

If the

1

offices are in different parts, is it always clear where

2

the award was made?

3

MR. BROMBERG:

Your Honor, I am aware that there

4

is some litigation on that question.

5

though, that I'm not familiar with it.

6

QUESTION:

I must admit,

If that is true, does that help or

7

hurt you in your interpretation of the statute?

8

one hand it means that there's perhaps multiple -- it

9

seems to me it would help you.

10

MR. BROMBERG:

On the

I think it does, because I think

11

what respondent has argued is that their interpretation

12

better fits with the policies underlying the act, because

13

it would eliminate any questions about the proper venue,

14

and would therefore be more consistent with the speedy and

15

efficient resolution of disputes.

16

QUESTION:

In this case, it was not the parties

17

but was the American Arbitration Association that

18

specified a place for the arbitration, is that so?

19

MR. BROMBERG:

That's correct.

The petitioner

20

objected to the location that was chosen by the American

21

Arbitration Association and in fact they filed this action

22

in the district in which they would have preferred to have

23

the arbitration conducted.

24
25

QUESTION:

The parties did stipulate for the

application of Mississippi law, and yet, although they

might have, they didn't provide for a forum for the

2

enforcement of the award.
MR. BROMBERG:

3

That's correct, Your Honor, and I

4

think that brings up one point, that -- one difficulty

5

with the restrictive interpretation that respondents have

6

suggested.

7

can only agree to a venue if that pertains to an

8

application to vacate and it is in an arbitration

9

agreement, because that is the only type of forum

Under respondents' interpretation the parties

selection clause that is specifically referred to in the

11

FAA, so they would construe, for example, sections 10 and

12

11, which do not contain any specific language concerning

13

forum selection clauses, to exclude such clauses.

14

We would suggest that a permissive

15

interpretation would better fit with the purposes

16

underlying the act, for two reasons.

17

would allow parties to agree to litigate in the most

18

convenient venue.

19

First of all, it

Now, there would be a difference between

20

applications to vacate and other applications.

21

Applications to vacate would be judged under section 9,

22

which provides an absolute mandate that forum selection

23

clauses be enforced.

24

be enforced under the general rule that governs forum

selection clauses that this Court announced in the Bremen

Furthermore, under a permissive interpretation

the parties would be able after an arbitration to look

around and determine what is the most convenient venue.

disputing which is the venue that they want, one wants one

and one wants the other?

9

MR. BROMBERG:

They may, Your Honor, and in that

situation I would suggest that a permissive interpretation

10

would also be the more reasonable and sensible one,

11

because it would allow for transfers under 1404(a) when a

12

venue that is selected is inconvenient.

13

QUESTION:

courthouse problem?

15

could have what happened here, one files in Mississippi,

16

the other files in Alabama, where if you say the only

17

place you can go, barring your agreement on some other

18

place, is the place where the arbitration occurs, and you

19

don't have the race to the courthouse problem.

20

But what about the race to the
If you have multiple venues, then you

MR. BROMBERG:

Well, Your Honor, I think that a

21

restrictive interpretation would solve some but not all of

22

that problem, because jurisdiction to enforce the FAA is

23

concurrent with the State courts, and I don't think that

24

sections 9, 10, and 11, which refer only to the United

25

States district courts, would apply to State courts.

(800) FOR DEPO

As a

1

consequence, a party that is interested in evading a

2

restrictive interpretation of section 10, for example,

3

would simply file their action in State court rather than

4

in Federal court.
QUESTION:

5

Is there an argument to be made as

6

with respect to convenience that if there really is a

7

mutually convenient venue the parties will have selected

8

it and, if they have selected it, the scheme of the

9

statute is that, having selected it once, that should be

10

the venue for all times whenever any issue on the merits

11

is being litigated, whether it litigated before the

12

arbitrator, or litigated later on on a motion to vacate or

13

to modify.

14

Is that -- would that be a sound argument?
MR. BROMBERG:

Your Honor, I think there are

15

many situations in which that argument would not apply.

16

Parties will agree to arbitrate in distant locations that

17

they would find it inconvenient to litigate.

18

easier to arbitrate --

QUESTION:

Because, what, they want the

arbitrator who lives there, is that -MR. BROMBERG:

22

lives there, they may be trying to accommodate the

23

convenience of witnesses, neither of which may be involved

24

in a post arbitration proceeding.

willing to accommodate the convenience of each other.

They may also be more

1

QUESTION:

Well, they may not trust the courts

2

of that jurisdiction, although they're willing to trust an

3

arbitrator who's selected by the parties.

4

MR. BROMBERG:

That is quite possible as well,

5

Your Honor.

6

for example, to conduct an arbitration at the hotel

7

airport in Dallas or in Chicago may be unwilling to

8

litigate in those districts because they don't want to

9

retain local counsel in those districts, so there are many

10

reasons why a venue that is convenient for arbitration may

11

prove to be inconvenient for future litigation.

12

I would also add that a party who decides,

I would also add that it is possible that

13

parties may want to consolidate a post arbitration

14

proceeding with another pending litigation between the

15

parties, or they may wish to file a single action which

16

will enforce an arbitration and also allow them to levy

17

against property of the other party, or seek execution in

18

the residence of the other party.

19

QUESTION:

Now, it would not be the consequence

20

of your interpretation, would it, that if the parties

21

agree in their arbitration agreement as to where

22

litigation concerning the arbitration award will be

23

conducted, that will govern?

24

MR. BROMBERG:

QUESTION:

It would not be?

It would not be.

MR. BROMBERG:

1

No, that would be, with I think

2

two caveats, Your Honor.

forum selection clause would only be absolutely

4

enforceable with respect to an application to confirm.
QUESTION:

One would be, an arbitration

Well, that's -- of course.

That was

6

mainly what I had in mind.

7

MR. BROMBERG:

8

QUESTION:

9

Section 10 --

Right.

-- even if you had an agreement,

would allow an order to vacate to be brought in the

10

district where the award was made, whether or not the

11

parties agreed to another district, isn't that right?
MR. BROMBERG:

12

I think that's correct, Your

13

Honor, and I would suggest that there is a sound reason

14

for that.

15

is partiality or corruption of arbitrators, also fraud.

16

That may involve the testimony of recalcitrant witnesses

17

from the district.

18

selection clauses and arbitration agreements can't foresee

19

that the other party is going to resort to fraud.

20

consequence, they should not be forced to litigate in a

21

district where they cannot subpoena necessary parties.

12

That's the way it works generally, isn't

MR. BROMBERG:

Your Honor, I think that's

13

correct, but it's not clear to me that that would be the

14

case under the restrictive interpretation that respondents

15

have suggested, for the reason that it's unclear under

16

their interpretation why Congress would restrict

17

applications to vacate to a single district.

18

intended that such applications be decided in one district

19

and one district alone, we would submit that it is not

20

clear that consent to venue in a different district would

be allowed.

1

not.

You would say that even a request to vacate may be

2

brought under the general venue statute as well.

3

MR. BROMBERG:

4

QUESTION:

5

Yes, Your Honor.

Which is the suit that you brought,

is a suit to vacate.
MR. BROMBERG:

6

That's correct, Your Honor, and

7

the reason that we reach that position, Your Honor, is

8

that we think that sections 9, 10, and 11 have to be

9

construed together.

As every court of appeals that has

10

considered the question has concluded, they must be

11

interpreted in tandem so that they are either all

12

restrictive or all permissive, and in our view, since

13

section 9 is clearly permissive, sections 10 and 11 have

14

to be construed as being permissive as well.
Now, this interpretation is also supported, as I

15
16

said earlier, by the structure of the act, by the venue

17

gap that would result, and also by the unexplained

18

distinction that would be created by a narrow

19

interpretation between sections 9, 10, and 11, and the

20

Federal Arbitration Act's other special venue provision in

21

section 204.
We also think that a permissive interpretation

22

23

is independently supported by the presumption that special

24

venue statutes are supplemented by the general venue

25

statute.

This presumption, which courts and commentators

1

have found implicit in this Court's decision in Suarez, is

2

based upon Congress' historical practice.

3

Congress has used special avenue statutes in order to

4

expand, not restrict, the venue available under the

5

general venue statute.

Historically,

Moreover, as I indicated before, where Congress

6

MR. BROMBERG:

8

9

Your Honor, I'd also like to

address one argument that respondent has made, and that's

10

that their interpretation, by posing a rigid and

11

restrictive rule, would serve the purposes of the Federal

12

Arbitration Act.
As I have already suggested, I think that the

13
14

value or the benefit of that rule is significantly

15

undermined by the fact that there is concurrent

16

jurisdiction in the State courts for Federal arbitration

17

proceedings.

18

I would also suggest, however, that there are

19

costs to a rigid and inflexible rule.

It would require

20

piecemeal litigation in certain cases.

It would also

21

prevent agreements on the most convenient forum from being

enforced.

be conducted in inconvenient fora, because no transfers

MR. BROMBERG:

Does the

Well, Your Honor, I think that is

an issue that this Court has debated long and hard in

6

Southland and its progeny.

7

find that the Federal Arbitration Act applies at least in

8

certain provisions to State courts.
QUESTION:

9

I think that Southland does

Yes, certainly substantive provisions

10

in Southland were held to apply, but what about provisions

11

to vacate awards and that sort of thing?
MR. BROMBERG:

12

Well, Your Honor, certainly

13

actions to vacate, some actions to vacate must be brought

14

in State court, because, as this Court recognized in Moses

15

H. Cone, the Federal Arbitration Act does not provide for

16

independent Federal subject matter jurisdiction.

17

consequence, a case that was between two parties resident

Now, there is another problem with respondent's

3

interpretation as well.

According to their

4

interpretation,

5

Arbitration Act it intended to exclude application of the

6

general venue statute.

7

venue statute basically provided only for venue in the

8

residence of the defendant, and respondent has failed to

suggest any reason why Congress would have wanted to

in 1925, when Congress passed the Federal

At that time, however, the general

10

prevent applications to confirm or to vacate or modify to

11

be brought in the residence of the defendant.

12

Finally, Your Honors,

I would suggest that their

13

interpretation would complicate the arbitration process

14

itself, because it would make parties less likely to reach

15

compromises and accommodations in the arbitration process

16

when they are determining where the location of the

17

arbitration should be.

18

is often quite contentious.

19

That question, as it stands now,

If that were given the added significance of

20

determining where future litigation would be conducted,

21

parties would be less likely to reach compromises, and I

22

think that's particularly true for parties such as

23

petitioner, who is from a rural area in Mississippi.

24

may be willing to agree to accommodate the convenience of

25

arbitrators to conduct an arbitration in another State, at

a major airport that has a hub, but he would be unwilling,

2

or at least less willing to conduct an arbitration there

3

if he knew that any subsequent litigation would be

conducted there.
In sum, Your Honors, I think that a permissive

6

interpretation is supported by the language of the FAA, by

7

the context in which that language is used, and by the

8

structure.

9

special venue statutes are supplemented by the general

It is also supported by the presumption that

If there are no more questions, I would like to

Congress or what the drafters of the FAA had in mind when

it put this statute together is to compare sections 9, 10,

And now you're saying, when they finish their

they started their original suit in the middle of the

8

if they happen to agree in their agreement, by the way,

9

we're always going to be able to sue each other in Iowa,

Worse than that,

10

always, even though they agreed to that, on your

11

interpretation, too bad, although you could go to Iowa to

12

have the thing confirmed, you have to stay in New York to

have it vacated, modified, et cetera.

14

I mean, I do not know why any human being would

want such a thing, and so I cannot think of what Congress

MS. WAGNER:

Justice Breyer, you asked certainly

We're

talking about venue of an action that challenges an

best forum, but there it is.

California because they think that's a more convenient

forum for their appeal.

They can't go appeal in

So why would Congress want to provide for that

5
6

review process to be in the same forum?

7

to an appeal, and that gives the district court some power

8

over the arbitration and over the proceedings because

9

they're in the same location.
QUESTION:

10

It is analogous

In fact, Justice --

If it were analogous to an appeal,

then why did Congress provide in section 9 that it could

certainly you would end up with, if you were in two

might pick an arbitrator in Hawaii just to -- you want him

In a normal litigation, of

That's right, and of course -Or that any -- it would only be

Hawaii courts that would have any particular ability to

very persuasive.

14

MS. WAGNER:

My question, Justice Stevens,

a complaint about it, want to modify a comma, vacate it,

or whatever, they have to stay in New York.
Now, I mean, why would somebody really want to

7
8

But should anybody have

do that, to take one example?
MS. WAGNER:

9

The answer to that question relates

10

to the fact, Justice Breyer, that this is a venue

11

provision.

It is not a subject matter provision.
And as you have pointed out, Mr. Chief Justice,

12

13

venue is waivable.

14

nothing about this particular statutory scheme that would

15

keep venue from being waivable, so we have a situation

16

where, if everybody agrees that Alabama or Mississippi or

1

parties can say, well, judge, we'd rather be here.
QUESTION:

2

Well, Ms. Wagner, your answer -- I

3

think, if I understand your answer, it assumes an answer

4

to Justice Scalia's question about the significance in

5

section 11 of apparently empowering that, the court

6

particularly mentioned in section 11, with the authority

7

to modify an award, and I take it your answer assumes that

8

any court with jurisdiction would have the authority to do

9

that if the parties otherwise waive the venue, any --

10

otherwise waive the restrictive venue provision, is that

11

right?

12

MS. WAGNER:

I would agree that if venue is

13

properly conferred by waiver, or in the case of section 9

14

by a forum selection clause, that the court would have the

15

power, then, to do whatever later comes up in that case.

16

Once a case is filed in an appropriate venue, in an

17

appropriate forum, that court could carry forward with the

18

rest of the case.

19

proceeding, or a section 9 proceeding, that court could

20

keep that case.

21

Whether it's a section 10 or 11

So although section 11, as Justice Scalia points

22

out, seems to envision proceedings by the same court, or

23

in the same geographical location as the arbitration, that

24

wouldn't necessarily always be the case because of these

25

principles of waiver and because of the principle of

What's the source of the power of a

Federal court to modify awards if it isn't section 11?
MS. WAGNER:

5

The -- section 11 empowers a court

6

to modify an award, but the provision as to which court

7

may modify the award is one of venue, so it's really a

8

compound provision in the sense that it grants power to

the district court but specifies a venue for exercise of

10

that power.

Honor, yes.

20

I'd like to, though, just make one point,

21

particularly about section 4, that I was discussing

22

previously, and that is that we have said that section 4

23

expressly, expressly incorporates the venue provisions of

24

25

was addressed in the reply brief and we have not had the

opportunity to respond, is that -- is the question of

2

whether section 4 is really referring to venue or whether

3

it's referring to subject matter jurisdiction.

4

And I would just point out that Congress

5

oftentimes, and certainly in the early part of this

6

century, has used the word venue when it really means --

7

has used the word jurisdiction when it really means venue,

8

or has used the word venue -- has used the word

9

jurisdiction broadly to include concepts of venue as well

10

as subject matter and personal jurisdiction, so by its

11

reference in section 4 to venue being concurrent with

12

jurisdiction under title 28, we say that that means that

13

venue under section 4 incorporates the venue provisions of

14

title 28 as well as subject matter jurisdiction.

to me.

3

In other words, this is sort of the background

rule of venue any place within this group.

but now when there is an arbitration and an action

Well, that's the issue.
Well, the language -It doesn't seem to me that section 4

you couldn't have had it for a suit to compel arbitration.

MS. WAGNER:

The question is, how

Do you read it with the

We say that section 4 has to be

20

compared and contrasted, that the language of section 4

21

has to be read alongside with 9, 10, and 11 to see that

22

they provide different venue.

23

you simply refer to the general venue statutes under title

24

28.

Section 4 says, venue is,

Section 9 says, for these proceedings you have just

There's nothing in 9, 10, or 11 that suggests

2

that venue applies under any other section of the act.
QUESTION:

3

But you've already said it isn't a

single court, because you could choose to have the award

5

confirmed by agreement, and then the modification would be

6

a compulsory counterclaim.

7

MS. WAGNER:

8

QUESTION:

9

That's correct.
And so it would be in a place other

than the place where arbitration was held.
But one question that I don't think your

10

presentation responds to is, the default venue, the place

Let me draw another analogy, Your

MS. WAGNER:

2

Under the old law there might have

been just one residence, because the residence definitions

Yes, Your Honor.

The modern

version of 1391 is in -- is on page 1 of the blue brief.
But getting back to your question, Justice

9
10

Ginsburg, why would the -- why would Congress choose the

11

default to be where the arbitration occurs when the

12

defendant's -- when the defendant's residence may be

13

elsewhere?

14

For the simple reason that there has been a

15

determination of an appropriate forum as part of the

16

arbitration proceedings either by the agreement or by the

17

arbitrator that is presumptively convenient, and very

18

simply, the FAA wanted to streamline -- the Congress

19

wanted to streamline arbitration proceedings by providing

20

that not every decision that an arbitrator makes should be

21

subject to second-guessing.

22

QUESTION:

But why do you say it is

23

presumptively convenient, because that was sort of the

24

point that an earlier question of mine was aiming at, and

25

I thought I got a very good answer to it.
38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

It may be very

1

inconvenient, but there may be a good arbitrator there, or

2

it may be sufficiently convenient if we're talking about

3

arbitration, but totally unacceptable if we're talking

4

about a willingness to submit to the jurisdiction of the

5

courts.
So I guess -- I guess I'm really asking you two

6

7

questions.

Why do you think it is presumptively

8

convenient, and number 2, why is presumptive convenience

9

the only consideration in trying to rationalize this?
MS. WAGNER:

10

First, the arbitrator or the

11

arbitration association is charged with the responsibility

12

for selecting a convenient forum, and again, Congress,

13

Your Honor, was trying to take those kinds of mundane

14

considerations away from a position where they would be

15

second-guessed by later court proceedings.

16

The arbitrator's discretion in many, many

17

matters is not subject to being second-guessed and

18

revisited in court proceedings.

narrow.
QUESTION:

20

The review is very, very

Well, the place of the arbitration

21

will not ne second-guessed, but that's not the question

22

we've got.

23

MS. WAGNER:

But the decision that the

24

arbitration is the most convenient forum for the parties

25

can carry forward with respect to later review, and

1

second, to answer your question, certainly the defendant's

2

residence may not be the best forum for review for a

3

number of reasons.

4

under section 10 and 11, which is review and which is a

5

challenge to the award, it provides that, for example, for

6

fraud, or for some kind of misconduct on the part of the

7

parties and the arbitrator, that that award could be set

8

aside.

Since we're talking about proceedings

The convenience not only to the defendant, or to
10

the party who is trying to uphold the award, but also to

11

witnesses, to the arbitrator him or herself, all of those

12

considerations of convenience of everyone involved come

13

into play in making a decision as to where the arbitration

14

should occur, and again, that can carry forward.

15

QUESTION:

Ms. Wagner, why shouldn't we just

16

apply -- you know, we have expressed a presumption in some

17

of our cases that where you have a special venue provision

18

we will presume it to be supplementary and not displacive

1

unless it is made clear that the opposite is intended.

20

do not consider it at all clear here that the opposite is

21

intended.

I

22

Why don't we just apply the presumption so that

And -But they pointed out about six ways

in which, once we go down that road, it's actually going

division of cases in all sorts of ways, which suggests

their way makes quite a lot of sense, and I don't want you

8

to leave without responding to the various points that

9

they've made as to how this is all going to get mixed up

10

11

if we take your route because of the cases being divided.
Remember, the other example was the example of

12

why can't we just assume that the general venue

2

statutes -- why can't we just apply this liberally.

3

Well, first of all, venue is not something that

4

you simply apply liberally out of some overriding policy

5

consideration.

6

you have to apply it as it was written, and second, the

7

section 10 and 11, particularly in contrast with section

8

4, simply cannot be read to leave that door wide open.

9

You have to look at what is intended, and

And I also would point out, as we have in our

10

briefs, that looking at the history of this section,

11

looking at the broad venue provision that Congress

12

rejected out of the New York statute in favor of the very

13

limited provisions, it's clear that they wanted to have

14

this to be a limited venue provision.

15

I'd like -- I'd also raise one other practical

16

consideration, and that is, a number of arbitrations in

17

modern day are consolidated, where there may be multiple

claims, multiple awards cases, you know, A versus B, C

one action is better than five, or even two, will say,

2

okay, this is a place of proper jurisdiction and venue,

3

but we're going to transfer to that other so that all the

4

arbitrations will go forward -- isn't that a typical use

5

of 1404(a) ?

6

MS. WAGNER:

Certainly 1404(a) can be used, but

7

the point is that FAA was intended to streamline, to

8

simplify this procedure to avoid post arbitration

9

arguments about procedural and matters of discretion.

10

QUESTION:

But in -- it's in the cases that you

11

put where arbitrations are often held in multiple cities,

12

multiple venues, where the arbitrators themselves are from

13

Chicago and New York and Los Angeles, it's not clear to me

14

where the award is made.

15

MS. WAGNER:

Courts that have addressed that

16

issue, Justice Kennedy, have said that where the hearing

17

takes place is venue for purposes under 9 --

18
19
20

QUESTION:

But they have multiple hearings in

multiple cities.
MS. WAGNER:

Then presumably any of those cities

21

would be an appropriate forum if the award is made in a

22

number of different places, with different aspects heard

23

in different places.

In light of the comparison between section 4 and
section 9, 10, and 11, also the contrast between 9, 10,

1

and 11, there really is only one reading that can be had

2

of this statute, that the intent of the Congress is clear,

3

and that the default provision for venue, the provision

4

that will apply in the cases where there is not already a

5

pending case, or whether there's not post arbitration

6

agreement, is going to be where the arbitration award took

7

place, where the hearing took place.

8

Congress has determined that that is
presumptively a proper forum, and that it simply should

10

not be subject to later litigation

11

might be some, you know, arguably better forum for that

12

proceeding.

13

as to whether there

Treating it like, as though it's an appeal

MS. WAGNER:

naturally ought to flow upstream through the same

2

location, but certainly there are circumstances where that

3

would not necessarily follow, and that would be cases

4

where there is jurisdiction that has been lodged in a

5

particular court, or where the parties simply waive venue

6

obj ections.

7

But looking at the statute as a whole, and

8

looking at a comparison of this statute with the broader

9

language of the New York statute that served as its model,

10

and that Congress rejected in favor of this very closely

11

delineated provision for venue, it's very clear what

12

Congress had in mind and, as this Court has held, has

13

often held, venue is not something that this Court can

simply apply in a way that seems convenient, or any court,

say, well, we're not going to defer to the first suit.

4

There's nothing that obliges the Alabama court to give

5

6

MR. BROMBERG:

Well, Your Honor, we have not had

7

the opportunity to brief that question, but I would add --

8

I would point out that there are what I think several

9

difficulties with a response like that.

10

The first is, I think that it is unfair to

11

require a party like the petitioner, who has objected to

12

arbitration being conducted in a particular place, to

13

force them, whether through a -- an absolute rule, as

14

respondent is suggesting, or through a presumptive rule,

15

to litigate post arbitration proceedings in that district.

16

The second thing that I would add is that some

17

of the problems that I pointed out about a restrictive

18
