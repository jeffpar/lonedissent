ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES B. LIEBER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LIEBER:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
For 24 years I have practiced in the

11
12

Pennsylvania courts.

13

follow the law and apply the Constitution.

14

a mistake or a miscarriage, there is a necessary

15

corrective, as there was in the case of Mr. Scarpone, my

16

client's co-defendant.

17

In case after case, our judges
When there is

Like his co-defendant, Mr. Fiore was and is

18

factually and legally innocent of a crime which has only

19

two elements and is plainly understood from the reading of

20

the statute.

disposal facility and doing it without first having a

22

license.

23

Those elements are operating a waste

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Lieber,

I suppose that the

24

highest court of Pennsylvania has determined that at the

25

time he committed the offense, it was an offense and that

they later interpreted the statute, but didn't give it

2

retroactive effect.

Is that what they've done?

MR. LIEBER:

3

Respectfully, I'd have to disagree,

4

Justice O'Connor.

5

did was deny a writ for allowance of appeal on the same

6

basis that this Court denies a writ for certiorari.

What the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania

No -

7
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, the court had three different

opportunities to take up Mr. Fiore's case presumably.
MR. LIEBER:

10

Presumably that's correct.

11

However, no inference can be drawn from their failure to

12

take jurisdiction under king's bench powers, which is an

13

emergency writ, or from not hearing the case in a

14

certiorari-like situation that mirrors your very rules.

15

QUESTION:

Well, but the case became final if

16

they took -- did not take it on certiorari.

17

your client has been convicted, finally convicted, by the

18

Pennsylvania State courts of being guilty of this crime.

19

Isn't that -- isn't that correct?

20

MR. LIEBER:

The fact is

My client's conviction is,

in fact,

21

final.

22

is that the Pennsylvania courts did not apply the law of

23

the Pennsylvania statute which, as this Court held in

24

Rivers v. Roadway Express and recently in the Bousley

25

case,

However, Mr. Justice Scalia, the problem with that

is -- is from the time of an action what the highest

2

court of -- of the State says it is.
QUESTION:

That's been the --

Mr. Lieber, in light of what you've

3

just said and in Justice -- in light of Justice O'Connor's

4

question, would your position be different if the

5

Pennsylvania Supreme Court had, indeed, held that the law

6

was as the lower courts thought it was; that is, even if

7

you had a permit, if you flagrantly violated it,

8

though you had none?

9

it was as

Suppose that was the Pennsylvania Supreme

10

Court's precedent and then in Scarpone's case, the Supreme

11

Court overruled that precedent.

12

different than it is today?

13

MR. LIEBER:

Would your position be

Only in one situation, Justice

14

Ginsburg, and that would be in the situation, as in

15

Wainwright v. Stone, where the judicial application to the

16

statute over a long period gave consistent notice to our

17

citizens that their conduct would violate -- would be

18

violative of the statute in keeping with judicial

19

construction.

20

Now, in Wainwright, there were 50 years of

21

judicial construction to alert those individuals that

22

their conduct was in fact proscribed.

23

Fiore ruling was, in fact, a first ruling under the

24

statute and it was a -- a judicial misconstruction of the

25

first order.

This was the -- the

QUESTION:

1

Well, if you -- if -- if Mr. Fiore

2

had been convicted like, say, 5 years ago under the

3

statute and 5 years later a new case arose with the same

4

kind of facts and was decided as Scarpone's case was

5

decided, would you be here making the same argument?

6

I

MR. LIEBER:

Your Honor, if there had been no

7

intervening law by our State supreme court, I would be

8

making precisely this argument.

9

QUESTION:

But, of course --

10

QUESTION:

You're asking for -- you're asking

11

for a very broad rule then, that no matter how much time

12

has gone by and in the -- your client's conviction had

13

become final on direct appeal and presumably many years

14

later, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania were to decide

15

that there is an -- an element of the offense missing,

16

your client still would be entitled to relief.

17

MR. LIEBER:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, not

18

necessarily.

19

decisions, again -- and habeas lies to see whether the

20

State would be taxed by the change, which I submit to you

21

is not really a change.

22

23

As I said, if there had been intervening

QUESTION:

It's just a new decision.

Excuse me.

Habeas lies to see

whether the State would be what by the change?

24

MR. LIEBER:

QUESTION:

Taxed.
Taxed?

MR. LIEBER:

1

Yes, Your Honor.

If the State

would be taxed by retrials and a floodgate problem and so

forth.

There was none of that in --

case, Your Honor.

7

Inconvenienced, you mean.
Yes.

There is none of that in this

None whatsoever.

QUESTION:

Two things about that.

First, isn't

8

there a good argument that he could have been charged and

9

indicted under a related section, that he was violating

10

the terms of the permit?
MR. LIEBER:

11

Your Honor, there's a good argument

12

I believe for Mr. -- for Mr. Fiore because he is presumed

13

innocent under that other section.

14

presumption of innocence.

15

QUESTION:

No, no, no.

He is cloaked with the

Let's assume that --

16

that he altered the pipe and that pollution was coming out

17

of the pipe, et cetera.

18

have had a good argument -- wouldn't the State have had a

19

good argument that he could be tried under that other

20

provision?

21

22
23
24
25

MR. LIEBER:

Assume that.

Wouldn't the State

They should have tried him under

that other provision, and they did not, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

All right.

Then -- then this is not

a case of innocent conduct.
MR. LIEBER:

It is a case, in fact, of innocent

conduct of the charge that was charged.

2

QUESTION:

3

You mentioned the Wainwright case.

4

me what that case is?

5

MR. LIEBER:

Well,

I recognize that.

Yes, Your Honor.

Can you tell

That's Wainwright

v. Stone, which is the case that the respondent

7

principally uses to defend.

QUESTION:

case.

It's a case which this Court

All right.

It's not a Commonwealth

Okay, thank you.
QUESTION:

May I just go back to Justice

12

Ginsburg's question and modify it slightly?

13

Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had held in your client's

14

case that, in fact, he was properly charged and then, as

15

odd as it might be, let's say a month later it went the

16

other way in the co-defendant's case, then your position

17

here would be different, wouldn't it?

18

MR. LIEBER:

If the

I'm not exactly sure that -- that

19

it would be, Your Honor, because I believe it would be

20

then the same position as in -- in Wright v. West, where

21

we would still test.

22

would still test the finding of the supreme court.

23

QUESTION:

If there was a sufficiency claim, we

No, but your sufficiency claim, as I

24

understand it, is essentially a claim that the evidence

25

was insufficient simply because it was, under Pennsylvania

1

law, evidence that could not, as a matter of logic, as a

2

matter of law, prove the -- the offense that he was

3

charged with, i.e., operating without a permit, as opposed

4

to operating in violation of a permit.

5

So, the point that I'm getting at is this.

If

6

in his case, in your client's case, the Supreme Court of

7

Pennsylvania said, yes, properly charged, the evidence in

8

fact is relevant and sufficient to convict, and then a

9

month later in the co-defendant's case, they said, no, the

10

-- the charge to which this -- this evidence was relevant

11

could only have been the charge of operating in violation

12

of a permit,

13

different because you would be -- in order for your client

14

to get relief, you would have to argue that there -- that

15

we should adopt a Federal rule requiring the States to

16

apply a decision, as in the co-defendant's case,

17

retroactively.

18

argument you're making here.

19
20

21
22

it seems to me your position would have to be

And as I understand it, that's not the

MR. LIEBER:

No, that's not the argument we're

making here.
QUESTION:

Okay.

And you'd run -- you would --

I assume you admit you would run into a Teague problem if

23

-- if you were in the situation of my hypo in which you

24

were asking for a Federal rule requiring State

25

retroactivity.

MR. LIEBER:

1

Your Honor,

I -- I can't admit that

2

because Teague only applies to procedural matters.

3

is clearly a substantive matter which decriminalized

4

behavior.

5

QUESTION:

This

But why would the situation be any

6

different than if we had a legislature saying the permit

7

is not an essential element, and then the legislature

8

changed that to say it is?

9

you have to show that you don't have a permit.

If -- if you have a permit,
Why isn't

10

the highest court of the State declaring the law the same

11

as the legislature declaring the law, and then when the

12

high court changes it,

13

doesn't have to be retroactive.

14

make that concession and that you were relying on the

15

Pennsylvania Supreme Court never having addressed this

16

question, never having settled what the State law was.

17

MR. LIEBER:

it's like a legislative change that
I thought that you had to

case.

22

submit to you respectfully, it's better because the

23

Pennsylvania Supreme Court has spoken.

24

it seems to me, if the case comes before them, whenever,

25

to define the elements, and when they do that, as -- as a

My position is that if the Pennsylvania Supreme

concurrence said in Bousley, that's not really

retroactivity.

That's explanatory behavior.

QUESTION:

3

Bousley, however, was a Federal --

4

construing a Federal statute where the -- perhaps the case

5

law may be somewhat different than just stepping into a

6

State situation.

7

MR. LIEBER:

Your Honor, but our case law in

8

Pennsylvania is identical under recently decided

9

Pennsylvania Supreme Court authority in Commonwealth v.

10

Shaffer.

11

in the Third Circuit, in the Ettinger case, for example,

12

which is cited in one of the briefs, took this same route

13

and said the statute is what it was from the time the

14

highest court in the State construes it.

15

we have here.

9

MR. LIEBER:
QUESTION:

10

Which makes a world of difference.
It does.

I misspoke.

Mr. Lieber, most of the cases that we

11

take in this Court are cases that involve circuit

12

conflicts, disagreements in the law,

in final decisions in

13

most cases, some of them years ago.

Now, is it your

14

position that every time we resolve such a circuit

15

conflict, the Constitution requires that all of those who

16

have been finally convicted, under the side of the

17

conflict that has lost here, are entitled to -- to be

18

released?

19

MR. LIEBER:

No, Your Honor.

Only in the -- the

20

extreme situation where you have actual innocence as the

21

gateway, coupled with a fundamental constitutional error

22

which went to --

23

QUESTION:

Well, take that kind of a situation,

24

limited to those cases where we have interpreted a

25

substantive statute in a certain way, and one set of

1

courts in cases, some of them decided years ago, have

2

interpreted that same statute a different way, which would

3

-- which would make a conduct that we have held to be

innocent in fact guilty.

5

-- who were convicted under that interpretation entitled

to be released?

MR. LIEBER:

Now, are all of those who were

I would say no, Your Honor, because

8

if you had made a decision on this Court, that would be a

decision that -- that those convictions earlier were

within the scope of the Constitution, whereas later they

11

were not.

1

2

Mr.

-- Justice Scalia is asking you

whether you think Bousley was correctly decided,
MR. LIEBER:

3

Absolutely, yes.

I think.

I believe this -

4

- this case derives at least from one -- derives from at

5

least one Bousley principle, which is the state of the

6

statute.

7

QUESTION:

But Bousley -- the -- you can -- our

8

cases say you can get relief from a Federal conviction on

9

habeas because of an error in statutory law, and the --

10

the same is not nearly as clear when you're talking about

11

a claimed error in State law.

12

MR. LIEBER:

Mr. Chief Justice,

I -- I agree

13

except when the error in State law is also an error of

14

Federal constitutional dimension.

15

QUESTION:

But we don't have any evidence from

16

any statement of a Pennsylvania court that there has been

17

an error in Pennsylvania law.

MR. LIEBER:

We have --we have a statement,

19

Your Honor, from the Pennsylvania Supreme

20

Court both -- excuse me -- from the Pennsylvania Supreme

21

Court in the Scarpone case that there was an error of

22

State law, a misconstruction of the statute which in fact

23

was also a Jackson error, although the State admittedly

24

did not say Jackson.

sufficiency problem.
QUESTION:

2

Well, the State court didn't have to

3

get into Federal constitutional law.

4

construe its own statute.

5

on a rule as narrow as this.

6

MR. LIEBER:

7

QUESTION:

All it had to do was

And it seems to me that you win

I agree, Your Honor.
If the State court holds that the

8

statute, as they construed it, clearly, inarguably, always

9

meant that, that there was no room for reasonable

10

disagreement, that somebody had just made an inexcusable

11

error in construing it otherwise in prior cases, when that

12

happens, which you are claiming happened here, then you

13

win because you can take advantage of the settled Federal

14

rule to the effect that every element has got to be

15

proved.

You don't have to have any broader holding from

holding in this case that would only release one person,

No, but you -- when you say

insufficiency of evidence, you're talking about evidence

14

that, as a matter of law, cannot prove an element of an

QUESTION:

Correct.
So -- so, your real argument is they

MR. LIEBER:

2

QUESTION:

Correct.
It seems to me the issue in this case

3

is whether when the supreme court decided your client's -

4

- or rather decided the other -- your co-defendant's case,

5

whether it was stating what the law was at the time the

6

statute was enacted or whether it was changing the law

7

from an intermediate court view that prevailed in the

8

interim.
MR. LIEBER:

9
10

It was stating the law from the

time it was enacted.
QUESTION:

11

And you say Pennsylvania's supreme

12

court has said that's what -- what the view is on the

13

first construction of a statute.

14

MR. LIEBER:

15

QUESTION:

Correct, Your Honor.
Suppose it were the other way around.

16

Suppose, first, a State intermediate court said, this

17

decision is prospective only.

18

posture of the case be then?
MR. LIEBER:

19

What -- what would the

At that time, Your Honor, I would

20

say that -- that a Federal court could -- could look to

21

that intermediate ruling as datum for a -- a construction

22

of what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court might or might not

23

say later.

24
25

QUESTION:

All right.

Suppose then the State

supreme court said, our decision is prospective only.

MR. LIEBER:

1

If the Pennsylvania Supreme Court

2

said the decision was prospective only,

that a Federal court would have to defer to it, but would

MR. GRACI:

11

Supposing in that opinion they had

You are correct -- and Justice Ginsburg had indicated

The reason this is a new decision, however, for

hypothetical or under your set of facts.

16

that a new decision is announced, by overruling prior

17

precedent.

18

holding that Your Honor suggested earlier, that would be

19

overruling a part of what Sunburst said because Sunburst

however, this Court's test set forth in Chevron Oil v.

And even though the -Right, and the hypothetical that --

MR. GRACI:

Well,

I guess if we have to use your

words, it's a changing decision because you say it is, but

5

it's a new decision under Pennsylvania's law.

It's -- it's new simply because they

7

had never taken up the question before.

8

9

MR. GRACI:

Well,

That's

Yes, but every issue -- you're

Do you think that the Pennsylvania

that since this was retroactive, the law was always such,

this individual has to be released.

announcing, this will -- this particular decision will not

it's clear that the

trial judge on the post-conviction proceeding thought that

he was following settled Pennsylvania law that he could

your view is a bread and butter issue in the Pennsylvania

10

fairly tough, not too tough, medium, that automatically

11

those things are all considered new rules in Pennsylvania

12

and they're not considered to have always been the law.

13

Now, if that's the way Pennsylvania works,

14

could find some cases, which I haven't found, where on

15

collateral State review, even after the Pennsylvania

16

Supreme Court decision, the habeas court, State, applies a

17

different rule.

would be true if that's the Pennsylvania rule, that bread

that the distortion of the meaning of a statute is not a
