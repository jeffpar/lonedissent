ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM D. COSTON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COSTON:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case raises the legal question of when a

10
11

product design is inherently distinctive under the Lanham

12

Act, but it also raises the more practical question of how

13

high will we raise a trademark barrier to competition.

14

The affluent consumer, the middle class

15

consumer, and the low income consumer all want to wear

16

clothes that are popular and stylish.

17

seersucker dress sold under the Samara label was also sold

18

with a noticeably different quality by Wal-Mart for $3.88

19

under different labels, Cuties by Judy and Small Steps.

Here, the $25

The effect of the court's injunction here is to

20
21

deny consumers the opportunity to buy any seersucker dress

22

with appliques which may or may not be found in the

23

collar.

24
25

Because of the tension in this case between
trademark law and competition law, we submit there is a

need for a new standard to measure when trade dress and

2

product configuration is inherently distinctive.

QUESTION:

Now, there were rather lengthy

instructions given to the jury in this case.

5

were a juror reading them, I'd be a little confused.

6

there -- apparently Wal-Mart didn't object to those

7

instructions, and we're not here being asked to find that

the instructions that were given were faulty.

it's -- it's -- I don't think that the test that you

And so,

propose would necessarily fit within the instructions that

11

were given, and yet that's what went to the jury.

MR. COSTON:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. COSTON:

Well, Justice O'Connor --- let it stand.
In -- in this case, we, Wal-Mart,

16

contended from day one that the trade dress was not

17

inherently distinctive.

18

QUESTION:

And I

We've never waived that point.

Right, but you submitted that

19

question to the jury, and the jury, for whatever reason,

20

has come back thinking it was inherently distinct.

MR. COSTON:

As this Court held in the Preponik

QUESTION:

Well, now, are you suggesting that if

16

you simply challenge a judgment under rule 50, even though

17

you made no objections to the instructions,

18

about a change -- that brings about a challenge to each

19

instruction?
MR. COSTON:

21

No,

that brings

I wouldn't go that far, Your

Honor.

QUESTION:

23

MR. COSTON:

Well, then what do you mean?
In this case the legal landscape of

24

the protectability of trade dress, particularly in product

configuration, has been shifting since Two Pesos.

Every

case produces a different result, and we submit that it -

- it is unfair to litigants in that climate to have to

predict with certainty what the standard would be.

are we supposed to define that term?

How -- how

Well, we submit, Justice O'Connor,

11

that on closer inspection of the statute, that Congress

12

has given us the answer to that, that Congress has said

13

for product configuration trade dress, the old-fashioned

14

rule works best.

design has earned any --

Go to secondary meaning.

QUESTION:

Rather than

Where -- where did Congress say that

we had to find that secondary -MR. COSTON:

In 1946, Congress adopted section

21

22

of possible marks, configuration of goods.

24

goods is found.

That's the

1

I'm not completely clear on -- on this first question

2

about the instructions below.

3

you're arguing here -- and correct me if I'm wrong -- is

4

not that the instructions were wrong, but simply that

5

there was not enough evidence under a proper criterion to

6

go to the jury and that you were entitled to judgment as a

7

matter of law --

8

MR. COSTON:

9

QUESTION:

I had thought that what

That is correct, Justice Scalia.
-- regardless of your -- you're not

10

complaining about the instructions.

11

this case, there was not enough evidence to go to the

12

jury.

13

MR. COSTON:

14

QUESTION:

You're just saying in

That is correct, Justice Scalia.
So, we not only have to agree with

15

you about the standard, but we also have to agree that if

16

we apply that standard, no reasonable jury could have come

17

out finding your -- your client liable.

18
19
20

MR. COSTON:

Or -- or it should be remanded to

the Second Circuit for that evaluation.
QUESTION:

We also believe that part of the

21

reason the importance of taking a case like this is given

22

the different standards in the various courts of appeals,

23

there is a need for some certainty so that juries can be

24

properly instructed.

25

an outcome here, that this jury was instructed on

MR. COSTON:

12

That was a trade dress case.
Yes.

I -- I submit not, Justice

13

O'Connor.

14

all trade dress requires proof of secondary meaning.

15

Court allowed the possibility that some trade dress might

16

require secondary meaning.

17

Qualitex case held just that, that color as a form of

18

trade dress always requires secondary meaning.

19

submitting that the shape of a product is like color,

20

never arbitrary, never inherently distinctive, but always

21

requires secondary meaning.

MR. COSTON:

And so, almost instantly when you

Well, without fighting the

hypothetical, my assumption would be that there would be

some packaging that would accompany it and probably a

any other indicia of source.

QUESTION:

I'm really saying I don't -- I don't

see why we have to -- why should we overrule Two Pesos?

12

It isn't really what you want us to -- to narrow it to

13

make sure that it really is an arbitrary kind of situation

where source is pretty readily indicated.

15

MR. COSTON:

I think -- I think the lower courts

That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.
But Two Pesos doesn't seem to make a

MR. COSTON:

Whether --

Different courts have interpreted

8

Two Pesos in different ways.

I think the majority view is

9

that Two Pesos was more of a packaging case, that it was a

way of packaging restaurant services, a servicemark if you

will, and restaurant food.

Justice Scalia.

17

configurations, in fact we do allow protection for product

18

configurations on proof of secondary meaning.

19

you'll find in the Patent and Trademark Office that there

20

is no reported decision that we can find that has ever

21

allowed an inherently distinctive product configuration,

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
If this Court had held in the Qualitex case that

7

color is an inherently distinctive source identifying

8

characteristic of products, the Patent and Trademark

9

Office would have been flooded with applications for color

10

marks and we would have been well on our way to having

11

color-coded industries.

12

would, likewise, have been affected.

13

begun thinking of color as source identifying more than

14

they had prior to the decision.

15

And the expectations of consumers
They would have

Instead, the Court looked toward the traditional

16

remedial role of finding that secondary meaning had been

17

established for the use of color on a particular product

18

in a particular industry and someone was appropriating the

19

good will in a way that was deserving of protection.

20

possible, in other words, for the courts to get too far

21

out in front on these issues in interpreting the law, and

22

there can be self-fulfilling prophecies of what becomes

23

source identifying, and industries can become regimented

24

into each producer having his own little niche.

25

that is the danger of too receptive a standard of inherent

But you don't give us any hint as to how that

MR. WALLACE:

6

I mean, it

Well, I -- what -- what we learned

7

from the Patent Office in looking at this is that it would

8

be difficult for them to conclude, in a registration

9

process, that there was anything inherently distinctive

10

about the individual garments that were at issue here.

11

They used common elements that the Seabrook inquiry would

12

not ordinarily allow protection for.
The claim here was not a claim that any

13
14

particular garment was entitled to protection or that any

15

particular garment was infringed, but it was a claim about

16

the -- the overall appearance or look of a line of

17

garments even though the garments held to infringe more

18

closely resembled individual garments than they resembled

19

this abstraction which was based on certain common

20

characteristics that sometimes were variable and sometimes

21

didn't even appear in certain garments.
QUESTION:

22

What about the aesthetically pleasing

23

element?

I mean, what -- what if people were buying these

pretty, this kind of design?

MR. WALLACE:

I -- I think that is correct,

Justice Souter.

It isn't quite that,

Could it

not be the fact that the -- a -- the only thing inherently

MR. WALLACE:

Well,

Then there would be no

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART M. RIBACK

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. RIBACK:

3
4

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
In terms of the legal standard that we're

5
6

advocating, we have no substantive disagreement with the

7

position of the United States in its brief about what must

8

be shown to establish that a product's design is

9

inherently distinctive under the Lanham Act.

In the

10

context of product design, Seabrook gives concrete

11

definition to the Abercrombie standard that this Court

12

endorsed in Two Pesos, carried forward in Qualitex.

13

other words, something that is commonly used on a product

14

is associated with the product and thus descriptive, and

15

something that is unique and unusual is not and,

16

therefore, is inherently distinctive.

17

In

Abercrombie, as focused by Seabrook, is

18

consistent with this Court's precedents in Two Pesos and

19

Qualitex.

and Trademark Office.

circuits, irrespective of how they articulate their legal

22

standard, in actual practice have been ruling on these

23

cases.

(Laughter.)

QUESTION:

4

I mean, you know, it doesn't prove

anything.
MR. RIBACK:

Well, no, Seabrook I believe asks

5

some concrete questions that enable you to give content to

the question of how inherently distinctive something is.

7

QUESTION:

Well, in inherent -- I know you're

8

going to do that, but if it's -- I just want to -- Justice

9

Scalia and the answer to my question have thrown me a

10

little bit.

And I -- I'd like you to focus, when you go

11

through this list, on the particular thing that they

12

brought up, which is where you have a word, it's pretty

13

easy to think of an arbitrary or fanciful word that

14

clearly is meant to designate source.

15

MR. RIBACK:

16

QUESTION:

17

That's right, Justice Breyer.
So, why bother with the secondary

meaning question?

18

MR. RIBACK:

19

QUESTION:

Right.
But what they've suddenly got me

20

thinking is -- it's very hard to find an example of a

21

shape or a configuration where you could say the same

22

because of what Justice Scalia said because where you do

23

have a weird shape or even a Coke bottle, you see, the

24

classic, the Coke bottle -- I mean, where you do have

25

that, the natural human reaction is to think, well,

they're trying to attract customers by the shape.

2

not trying to indicate source.

3

they're trying to -- it's weird, a grape brush.

4

and even the Two Pesos, you see?

They're

They're trying to -It's --

5

So -- so, if that's so, why not force people at

6

least to prove secondary meaning so we don't get into all

7

the rest of this case?

8

that solves the problem that he brought up.

9

us either to change Two Pesos or to create a new,

I mean, there we've got -- and
It does force

10

difficult distinction, the one between packaging and trade

11

dress.

12

But maybe now I'm thinking those are the lesser

13

of the evils.

14

either of those two, but maybe this -- this new

15

distinction would be the lesser evil.

like you to address.

17

So -- so, I grant you those would be bad,

MR. RIBACK:

So, that's what I'd

Well, if I -- if I may, Justice

18

Breyer, I think that something that you said was

19

inaccurate, which is if you're trying to draw customers

20

based on the shape, then that is an indicator of source.

21

QUESTION:

But what we don't want is to have the

22

Lanham Act protecting a shape because it's an attractive

23

shape or even a repellant shape that people would buy

24

something because of the shape.

don't want the Lanham Act to protect that even to 1 inch.

All you want the Lanham Act to protect is the source, the

fact that the customer thinks, oh, I see what that means,

MR. RIBACK:

Lanham Act that tells you that the same feature of a

product can't serve more than one purpose.

You

QUESTION:

You don't

Yes, but that's why we want to do it.

13

I mean, the Lanham Act doesn't tell us this -- I'm not

14

saying they can't.

15

least, before we start interfering with aesthetic and

16

other purposes, force the plaintiff to the proof that

17

people really do think this indicates a source rather than

18

having a judge or a jury guess it.

19

I'm just saying that -- that let's at

MR. RIBACK:

Well, there's a number of problems

20

with that, if I may.

21

the lower courts, in terms of the advocating a separate

22

test for product design or saying the product design

23

should more likely have secondary meaning, is two things.

24
25

I think what's been coming out in

One is this concern that was stated about
protecting the item itself.

The item itself is not what's

point.

about the particular mark that's being claimed that is

necessary so that competitors won't be foreclosed, then

that feature is functional, and if that feature is

MR. RIBACK:

source indicator as readily as they might perceive a

package.

12

it's true, that doesn't mean the test is different.

it means is if you apply the right test, you're going to

forecloses that because Two Pesos says that one of the

things that the Lanham Act says you do not need to do is

require secondary meaning of someone who has an inherently

QUESTION:

MR. RIBACK:

Is that a practical suggestion?
I think the harm is this.

You can

go in today on January 19th, 2000 into a store with

4

certain perceptions about what is and is not likely to be

5

used by consumers to identify products.

secondary meaning argument.

January 19, 2000 as your baseline.

But you -- you can use

That's a

10 years from now, what sort of products will be there,

10

what sort of innovative methods of differentiating one

11

product from another there will be, or -QUESTION:

12

Yes, but why isn't this simply an

13

argument to the effect that it's always -- there's

14

something ultimately time based about secondary meaning?

15

That's going to be true in every secondary meaning

16

situation.

17

MR. RIBACK:

That would get rid of inherent

18

distinctiveness altogether.

19

addition to that, that there is any principled way in

20

which you could distinguish packaging from secondary

meaning.

with that.

Yes.

2

I'm sorry.

3

QUESTION:

What?
No.

I -- I'll make that assumption

4

that I can't make that distinction.

5

-- I don't know how -- frankly, I don't know how you apply

6

it in Two Pesos.

7

MR. RIBACK:

I don't know how to

I think in Two Pesos it would

8

depend on whether you think the restaurant was serving

9

food or serving a dining experience.

If the restaurant is

10

serving food, then it's a package.

11

dining experience, then the ambiance and the layout are

12

part of it.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. RIBACK:

If it's serving a

Right.
And it's a product design case.

15

And I think restaurants do serve -- do serve you with a

16

dining experience.

17

QUESTION:

Yes, but I think the assumption in

18

Two Pesos was that it was -- it was not the dining

19

experience because then it would have been part of the

20

product, and I think it was treated as though it was part

21

of the packaging.

22

MR. RIBACK:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Well, I -Maybe it was wrong, but I thought

that was the assumption.
MR. RIBACK:

I don't think the opinion bears

1

that out because what the opinion talks about, if you look

2

at Two Pesos, when they have the discussion of section 2,

3

it talks about if a verbal or symbolic mark or the

4

features of a product design may be registered under

5

section 2.

6

And I think the reason that Two Pesos is

7

addressed toward product design very heavily is because

8

when you look at the four Second Circuit cases that were

9

disapproved in the Two Pesos case, every last one of those

10

is a product design case.

11

Now, I'm not saying that every one of the

12

product design cases that was addressed there would

13

necessarily be inherently distinctive, but Two Pesos says

14

that you cannot exclude that possibility.

15

QUESTION:

It seems to me that one can draw a

16

distinction -- maybe it's pretty fine -- between packaging

17

and product, though, and one can interpret Two Pesos to

18

just relate to packaging rather than product.

19

also, although there really is some tension in it, to say

20

that in -- in a line of clothing that appeals to the

21

aesthetics of the -- of the purchaser, that aesthetics in

22

that context is functional and part of the -- and

23

therefore, distinctiveness would not qualify for Lanham

24

Act protection but would qualify for copyright protection.

25

It seems you could fit that scheme together I think.

And one can

1

Maybe I'm wrong.
MR. RIBACK:

2

I -- I'm not sure that's exactly

3

right because the entire thrust of Two Pesos is that --

4

first of all, it never mentions the word package I don't

5

believe, other than in one of the concurrences.
QUESTION:

6

But that was the argument.

But -I can't

7

remember exactly how it was phrased, but that the -- all

8

the Mexican features of their restaurants had nothing --

9

was not functional at least and, therefore, was more like

10

a packaging -- more like packaging than the product

11

itself.

12

MR. RIBACK:

Well, that only presumes that the

13

product itself is what's being protected.

14

talking about that.

15

isn't necessarily part of the product where the product

16

would still be the product even if you stripped the

17

feature off, which would be certainly the case with what's

18

at issue in this case.

19

You could -- the product would still be the product, and

20

you could then put those features onto something else.

MR. RIBACK:
