CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. BRUCK

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BRUCK:

8

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In Simmons v. South Carolina, this Court held

11

that a capital defendant may rebut the State's allegation

12

of future dangerousness by showing, if it is so, that he

13

could never be paroled from prison on a life sentence if

14

the jury gave him a life sentence.

15

Immediately after deciding Simmons, this Court

16

reversed this case and remanded it to the Virginia Supreme

17

Court for reconsideration in light of Simmons.

18

The issue now presented is whether the Virginia

19

Supreme Court erred when it effectively engrafted onto

20

this Court's holding in Simmons an additional requirement

21

that, in order to come within the ambit of Simmons, a

22

defendant must not only have no possibility under State

23

law of being released on parole throughout his entire

24

lifetime, but also that that ineligibility have been

25

formally declared on the day of his capital sentence.

QUESTION:

Well, you say the -- the court

3

engrafted that onto Simmons.

4

Simmons had simply spoken in terms of eligibility for

5

parole under State law.

MR. BRUCK:

But I -- I thought that

Yes, but it -- it looked at -- it

implicitly looked at all of State law and not -QUESTION:

Well, how can you -- how can you say

it implicitly looked at all of State law?
MR. BRUCK:

Parole eligibility under Simmons

11

means that there is no possibility of parole absent -- and

12

the Court looked at remote -- what it described -- the

13

plurality described as hypothetical possibilities, some of

14

which would have --

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Well, but -- but the plurality is not

the controlling opinion in that case.
MR. BRUCK:

Yes, but the concurrence necessarily

18

had to accept -- in order to reach the same result, had to

19

accept the plurality's characterization of parole

20

ineligibility as not including remote hypothetical

21

possibilities.

22

which can lead to parole eligibility and release on

23

parole, clemency which can have the same, and also a

24

change of law.

25

And it listed such things as commutation,

QUESTION:

1

When you say -- now, tell me again.

2

When you say it, what are you referring to?

3

opinion?

4

MR. BRUCK:

The plurality

The plurality made this explicit,

5

but the concurring opinion of Justice O'Connor, which

6

created the majority in Simmons, could not have taken any

7

other view because if that was correct, then it would not

8

be -- if -- if the plurality opinion as to what

9

constituted ineligibility was not the view of the Court,

10

then Simmons -- the holding of Simmons as expressed by the

11

concurring opinion could not have been handed down because

12

it would not be possible to say, given these remote

13

hypothetical possibilities in the future, that Mr. Simmons

14

himself was truly ineligible for parole.

15

QUESTION:

Well, this is something slightly

16

different than that, of course.

17

hypothetical possibility at all, but rather an expected

18

entry of a judgment, is it not?

19

MR. BRUCK:

20

QUESTION:

It's not a remote

Yes, but it is -And -- and is that a ministerial act,

21

or -- or what was to take place here?

22

something that might well not have occurred --

MR. BRUCK:

No.

or whether we simply acknowledge that it was inexorable

All motions to -- to strike the evidence, that is, for

already denied and, under Virginia law, could not be

renewed.

It was going to happen.

The sentencing was 19 days away.

9

Now, the -- interestingly, the State has never,

10

until its brief in this Court, ever identified something,

11

anything, that might have happened in reality to -- to

12

block the entry of that judgment and thus --

MR. BRUCK:

QUESTION:

19

Now, the defense counsel did tell and

Yes.
-- did he not -He did.
-- that this person would never, as a

practical matter, get out, if he lived to be 120?
MR. BRUCK:

20

Yes, but Virginia law prohibited him

21

from giving the most important aspect of that, which was

22

that these long terms of years could not be reduced by

23

parole, and the jury spotted the omission.

24

that.

We don't have to speculate about that because they

possibility of parole?
Now, this is the Simmons question.

Recall that

3

Simmons is a right of rebuttal.

It is not a right to have

4

the defendant's technical legal status on the day of his

5

sentencing hearing exhibited to the jury.

6

to rebut an issue that the State brings into the case in

7

-- under Virginia law.

8

joined much more vigorously than it ever was in Simmons.

It is a right

And under Virginia law, it was

In Simmons, it was a non-statutory factor that arguably
10

was present in the prosecutor's jury argument.

11

was the entire legal basis for the State's request for the

12

death penalty.

13

QUESTION:

Here it

Mr. Bruck, in this case you say, you

14

know, it's pretty clear that it would have -- in the next

15

case it won't be quite so clear that -- you know, that --

16

that he will get the third -- the third strike which will

17

render it impossible for him to be paroled.

18

case will be a little less clear than that.

1

And the next

Frankly, I -- I don't know where to stop, short

20

of the bright line that's urged by your opponents in this

21

case, which is at the time the sentence in this case was

22

pronounced, could you say it was the State law that this

23

person could not be paroled?

24

the time that this -- that this jury was sitting.

25

MR. BRUCK:

And you could not say it at

But we do say that because what

Virginia failed to do is to look not at the single

2

statute, but at the entire relevant body of State law

3

which includes the provisions of State law that I was

4

citing a moment ago to Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

5

Well, shouldn't we look to the

6

Virginia Supreme Court for that decision as to -- I mean,

7

are you saying that the State supreme court in deciding a

8

question of whether someone was parole eligible made a

9

mistake of State law?

10

MR. BRUCK:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BRUCK:

No.

We should definitely --

What are you saying?
-- look to the Virginia law if the

13

State gives us the law and if the State looks at the

relevant State law.

QUESTION:

18

MR. BRUCK:

QUESTION:

Well -I'm sorry.
Well, you -- you concede, don't you,

20

that under the law of Virginia, this person was not

21

eligible for parole at the -- at the critical -- or was

22

eligible for parole at -- at the critical point?

23

MR. BRUCK:

We concede that -- that under

24

Virginia law, his ineligibility had not yet been formally

25

declared, but when one takes into consideration the other

1

provisions of Virginia law, we by no means concede that

2

there was any possibility of his ever being paroled.

3

that is the question in rebuttal that -- that it was so

4

crucial in this case and that Simmons recognized what the

5

--a defendant has a due process right to have the jury

6

know about.

7

QUESTION:

And

Well, you're saying -- I guess you're

8

saying -- that the question of what is a sufficient

9

certainty or a sufficient probability, if you will, that

10

there will be no parole is a question of Federal law.

11

That's a question of what Simmons means, and Simmons was a

12

constitutional decision.

13

MR. BRUCK:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, although -So, Virginia can say, yes, in this

15

sense the -- the ineligibility is yet to be determined

16

because a decree has not been entered.

17

saying the question before us, the Simmons question is, is

18

it certain to a sufficient degree of probability, however

19

we may want to articulate that, for Simmons purposes, that

20

he will not, at some relevant future time, be parole

21

eligible and that's a question of Federal law?

But I think you're

22

MR. BRUCK:

That's correct.

23

Now, that is certainly a -- a question that is

QUESTION:

Well, Justice Scalia has raised a

question which I think is one that should be of concern,

11

and that is, where do you draw the line?

line drawn?

13

substance it was, in effect, just a ministerial act that

14

remained and therefore this man was parole ineligible,

defendant wouldn't be parole eligible for 80 years?

Simmons itself because if Virginia was correct that the

2

rule of Simmons only can be called upon when State law has

3

already affixed the stamp of parole ineligibility to a

4

defendant, then Simmons would have lost the case.

5

reason for that, as the State pointed out in their brief

in Simmons, is that under South Carolina law -- and there

The rule in Virginia, under the Virginia Supreme Court's

QUESTION:

No.

But our question is the Simmons

question.

The Federal law question is ineligibility

7

certain to a very high degree.

8

no, it's not because under Virginia law, entry might not

9

have been entered -- a judgment might not have been

10

entered on this conviction, and the reason might be

11

because the judge felt sorry for him or for some other

12

reason or --

MS. BALDWIN:

QUESTION:

And -- and you're saying,

Many other reasons.

-- or because he made a -- a motion

15

which we don't now have before us, a motion that might

16

have led the judge to do that.

17

that possibility is sufficient for Simmons purposes to say

18

that his parole ineligibility is uncertain, then the

should equally lead to an uncertainty that would bar the

1

the United States under Simmons, and you're saying that

2

the -- the possibility that judgment may not be entered

3

makes the ineligibility point too uncertain to apply

4

Simmons.

5

the possibility of an appeal in Virginia, upon which he

might get relief, presumably also makes ineligibility too

7

uncertain to apply Simmons.

8

And all I'm saying is, if that is sound, then

MS. BALDWIN:

Isn't that right?

No, I think that's not right

because Simmons doesn't speak in terms, anywhere in the
10

opinion, of -- of some separate Federal issue apart from

11

what State -- State law defines as ineligible.

12

QUESTION:

Well, never mind even State law.

13

Even if we were doing it on the basis of Federal law

14

looking at Virginia, if the conviction were overturned on

appeal, I assume what would happen is that the prior

16

ineligibility for parole, which existed upon the

conviction, would be eliminated.

18

MS. BALDWIN:

Isn't that right?

It would be.

QUESTION:

3

May I ask you a question on this

point?

Is it not correct, whether we call it Federal law

or State law, if we look at the concurring opinion in

6

Simmons, that if the judge had given an instruction -- but

7

as you say, he didn't really have to give -- saying that

8

as things look right now, if that judgment is entered,

9

he'll be ineligible for parole.

The prosecutor would have

10

been entirely free to ask the judge to say yes, but that

11

judgment might be set aside on appeal.

12

entered.

13

There might be a change in the law, and there might be a

14

pardon.

He might escape.

It might not be

There might be commutation.

15

So, the -- that even if the instruction had been

16

given, to the extent that there is this uncertainty in the

17

picture, it -- perhaps the prosecutor could easily have

18

cleared that up and said nothing in life is certain

19

because of all these factors.

20

MS. BALDWIN:

That's correct, Justice Stevens,

21

but Simmons does not require the instruction unless he is

22

ineligible.

23

QUESTION:

No, but one of the points that's made

in Simmons is that the prosecutor has this option of being

sure that the information is not misleading.

-- is not misleading the jurors.
If -- well, but Simmons tells

State courts very clearly, expressly a very narrow

6

exception to the general rule was carved out in Simmons.

7

QUESTION:

The concurring opinion in Simmons

8

pointed out that this is an exception to the general rule,

9

that you ordinarily don't get into this subject because it

10

can be so confusing to the jury.

11

MS. BALDWIN:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

Of course, it also pointed out how

13

unfair it is for the prosecutor to make an argument about

14

future dangerousness and conceal the fact that he's not

likely to get out of prison.

in the concurring opinion.

17

MS. BALDWIN:

It -- that argument is also

Well, I would disagree with that

18

because I think what Simmons expressly says is that's only

19

unfair if he would be ineligible as a matter of State law.

And you have to look at when a State court is reading

21

Simmons, is it reasonable for them to rule and to decide

-- read Simmons, look at this defendant.

MS. BALDWIN:

5

QUESTION:

Now, I think maybe that's

Well, I think --

--no, it isn't.

But one thing I

6

would be certain is I don't think that the State court's

7

answer to that question would get deference from a Federal

8

court.

9

MS. BALDWIN:

Well, then I think the Federal

10

court then would be redetermining State law ineligibility

11

for parole, and that is not contained anywhere in Simmons.

12

What Ramdass --

13

QUESTION:

I guess we could have said in Simmons

14

that the question is whether he is likely to be paroled by

15

-- by South Carolina or -- or very likely to be paroled by

16

Virginia.

17

QUESTION:

Beyond a reasonable doubt.

Beyond a reasonable doubt.

Yes.

This Court could have said

that.
QUESTION:

We didn't say that.

We said whether

here is simply that his order of convictions came

different than what he wishes they were.

4

5

for a continuance or asked for something to make him

6

ineligible under State law because that's his real

complaint here -QUESTION:

8

He never preserved that claim.

QUESTION:

If he

May I ask --

MS. BALDWIN:
10

That claim isn't

-- one that was never made.

-- how -- is your answer to their

11

argument that the same thing was really true in South

12

Carolina because the parole board hadn't yet made him

13

ineligible for parole, that that's not mentioned in the

14

opinion?

15

Is that your answer to that argument?
MS. BALDWIN:

Well, but you can't impute that

16

certainly to the Virginia Supreme Court reading Simmons

17

because that entire argument --

18

QUESTION:

But even though that's part of our

1

holding, our opinion didn't explain that and therefore the

20

State court wasn't on notice.

25

MS. BALDWIN:

Justice Stevens, I don't believe

it's in the opinion at all.
QUESTION:

No, I know it isn't, but it was in

the briefs.
MS. BALDWIN:

Correct.

QUESTION:

1

And so you -- but if that fact had

2

been spelled out, do you think Simmons would have been

3

decided differently?

4

MS. BALDWIN:

5

QUESTION:

No, I don't.

No.

So, then isn't -- isn't it fair

6

to say even though that was the holding and the only

7

unfairness for the Virginia Supreme Court is it wasn't

8

spelled out in the opinion?
MS. BALDWIN:

9
10

11

No, no.

Then at least he would

have -QUESTION:

If they had read the briefs and knew

12

that was a fact, do you think they would have come out the

13

same way in this case?

14

MS. BALDWIN:

If it was -- if that was -- if his

15

claim of a different standard of reviewing parole

16

eligibility, for whatever reason, because the parole board

17

in South Carolina hadn't yet announced it or --

18

QUESTION:

Well, the argument would be the same

19

argument you're making here, that he really was not yet

20

ineligible for parole because the parole board had -- had

21

not yet entered the order that made him so.

MS. BALDWIN:

I think then at least he'd have

some argument here, but he has no argument here because

Simmons doesn't say that.

2

QUESTION:

But Simmons decided that.

Simmons

decided that.

3

MS. BALDWIN:

4

QUESTION:

To my knowledge --

Because that argument was on the

5

table and the Court didn't think it was strong enough even

6

to mention in the opinion and yet rejected it.

7

MS. BALDWIN:

If that's true, if we have to

8

impute that to State courts to go back and read the briefs

9

to see what was rejected, Justice Stevens --

10

QUESTION:

Either that or we have to assume that

11

most State courts would react to that argument the same

12

way we reacted to that argument, that it's so obviously

13

frivolous that to wait for that meaningless delay, that

14

that shouldn't change the result.

15

MS. BALDWIN:

Well, I think absent it somewhere

16

in the opinion, you simply can't say that the Virginia

17

Supreme Court unreasonably applied Simmons.

Mr. Bruck, you have 7 minutes remaining.
