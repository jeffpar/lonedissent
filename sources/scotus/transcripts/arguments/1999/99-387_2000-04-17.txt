ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT RADASEVICH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. RADASEVICH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in the case before the Court this

11
12

morning is whether taxing authorities should be subjected

13

to shoulder the same burden of persuasion as other

14

creditors in bankruptcy to prove the allowance of their

15

claims.

16

question, to note that the validity of claim under State

17

law is not the same as the allowance of a claim under the

18

Bankruptcy Code and under the Bankruptcy Act which

19

preceded the code.

20

is illustrative of that dichotomy.

21

We think it's essential, in resolving that

This Court's prior decision in Vanston

Bankruptcy is fundamentally a process which

22

realters and restructures debtor-creditor relationships.

23

When matters of State law giving rise to rights between

24

parties are at odds or are inconsistent with policies or

25

procedures underlying the Bankruptcy Code, those aspects

of State law give way.
We argued in our brief that the general practice

2

3

under the Bankruptcy Act was to require taxing

4

authorities, like all other creditors, to shoulder the

5

burden of persuasion to establish the allowance of their

6

claims.

7

QUESTION:

Now, the respondent disputes that,

8

Mr. Radasevich.

9

authority on both sides and it simply wasn't well-

10

He says there really wasn't -- there was

established .
MR. RADASEVICH:

11

We recognize in our moving

12

papers, Your Honor, that there was aberrant authority that

13

took the position that taxing authorities did not bear the

14

burden of persuasion on their claims.
QUESTION:

15
16

There was no decision from this

Court.

17

MR. RADASEVICH:

18

QUESTION:

Correct, Your Honor.

So that you characterize as aberrant

19

one side rather than the other.

20

that?

21

MR. RADASEVICH:

What is your basis for

The basis, Your Honor, is the

22

decisions that come down and the volume of the decisions

23

that came down on the side of the equation that taxing

24

authorities bear the same burden.

authoritative treatise as to what the standard of preÂ­

2

code practice was, with no indication of any alternative

3

viewpoint, took the position that the burden -- that

4

taxing authorities bore the burden of persuasion on tax

5

claims.

6

When Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Code of

7

1 78, the legislative history indicates that it gave

8

careful consideration to the treatment of tax claims in
bankruptcy estates.

The legislative history that we cite

10

in our brief, I believe on page 16, indicates that

11

Congress was concerned about the interplay between

12

creditor rights of ordinary trade creditor variety,

13

consensual trade creditors, the interests of the debtor,

14

and the interests of taxing authorities

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Radasevich, what was the head

16

count of cases on your side versus those on the other side

17

under the previous legislation?

18

MR. RADASEVICH:

Many of the cases that were

1

cited in the appellant's brief we don't believe stood for

20

the proposition that the taxing authorities bore the

21

burden of persuasion.

22

QUESTION:

How about Judge Posner's opinion on

23

B-8 of the appendix?

24

your favor, but -- which he acknowledges are a majority,

25

and he says the Third and Fourth Circuits have reached an

2

opposite conclusion.

He cites Landmark.

MR. RADASEVICH:

That is correct, Your Honor.

3

There were decisions on both sides of the equation.

We do

4

not take the position that there weren't decisions on both

5

sides of the equation.

6

that what appeared to be the majority view under the Act,

7

and which Collier's thought was a majority view under the

8

Act, was that taxing authorities bore the same burden of

9

persuasion as other creditors.

What we argued in our briefs was

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. RADASEVICH:

12

QUESTION:

Whether --

But then we -Excuse me.

-- in that mixed picture I think

13

would have the obligation to decide which is the better

14

view, since we're not bound by one side or the other of

15

that pre-code split.

16

so shouldn't the proper role for this Court be to decide

17

what is the better position?

18
19
20

There is nothing definitive earlier,

There is -- the code itself is totally silent on
this issue, is it not?
MR. RADASEVICH:

Yes.

The code and the act

21

before it were silent, Your Honor, and we do agree that

22

because there was no decision from this Court under the

23

Act it's proper for this Court to look at the rationale of

24

placing the burden either on taxing authorities or on the

25

objecting party under the Bankruptcy Code.

And if the Court determines that there wasn't a

1

2

predominant practice under the Act, so that it was --

3

Congress was deemed to have accepted that practice under

4

the code, certainly practice under the Act and the

5

legislative history under the code is illustrative of the

6

concerns that Congress had, and I think it's helpful to

7

this Court in reaching its decision as to where the burden

8

of proof should lie.

9

QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't we normally look to

10

State law for the substantive law giving rise to any

11

claim?

I mean, is that what we normally do?

12

MR. RADASEVICH:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And if the State law provides that

14

the burden of proof is on the taxpayer, why wouldn't we

15

follow that, or vice versa?

16

MR. RADASEVICH:

The validity of claims under

17

nonbankruptcy law is not the same as the allowance of

18

those claims in the bankruptcy estate.

19

hearkens back to its Vanston decision, in Vanston what the

20

issue was was whether interest on interest was due in an

21

indentured bond situation.

If the Court

What the Court found was that because the

relationship of the parties with respect to the debtor's

3

ability to make payments, that allowing the creditor to

4

obtain interest on interest, which was -- the Court

5

assumed was valid under the prevailing State's law, it's

inequitable to other creditors of the estate.

Since the Bankruptcy Act changed the

It focused on a small aspect of the

Well, but the code -- the Act gives

11

tax claims priority, which indicates a certain preference,

12

in a sense, for paying the taxes.

13

MR. RADASEVICH:

Absolutely it does, Your Honor.

14

The Bankruptcy Code gives taxing authorities benefits in

15

several different areas, and the legislative history that

16

we cited indicates the best result of Congress' concern

17

about the interplay of taxes and creditor rights and

18

rights of bankrupt debtors.

19

But this Court also recognized in Whiting Pools

20

and in Energy Resources that just because taxing

21

authorities or other creditors are given priorities, are

22

favored in one portion of the Act, does not necessarily

23

mean they're favored in others, and when Congress

24

attempted to balance the interests of taxing authorities,

25

other creditors, and the debtor, it did so by giving

taxing authorities and banks tier priority.
QUESTION:

2

Well, one might argue that the view

3

of the Seventh Circuit here does not really favor taxing

4

authorities in that sense.

the substantive law from State law in each case and that

the burden of proof in this case is a matter of

substantive law.

about, isn't it?

That's what the case is really all

MR. RADASEVICH:

9

It simply says, we're taking

Yes, Your Honor.

That is what

10

Judge Posner held in his decision.

11

disagree that in filling a gap, essentially, in the text

12

of the Bankruptcy Code, that this Court is required to

13

adopt State law.
QUESTION:

14

We respectfully

You don't deny, I take it, that that

is a part of the State law of Illinois, the burden of

proof.

MR. RADASEVICH:

Burden of proof were matters of

substantive law under Erie, yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I guess the question is, is whether

20

we in effect would be chipping away at the concept of the

21

validity of the claim if we did not recognize the burden-

22

of-persuasion rule, and the argument, I suppose, that we

23

would be chipping away at it, that we really would not be

24

recognizing validity 100 percent, is the argument that the

25

burden of persuasion is so important to the Government's

1

claim that you really cannot conceive of the claim in

2

traditional terms without conceiving of it as one upon

3

which the taxpayer has the burden.

4

And the argument for that, as I understand it,

5

is, the taxpayer is usually the one who has the most easy

6

access to the facts, and the easiest access to the

7

evidence upon which ultimately the tax liability is going

8

to depend, so if you take that argument, that by removing

9

the burden of persuasion you really are taking away an

10

element that goes very importantly to the validity, what

11

is your response to that?

12

MR. RADASEVICH:

I think that is precisely the

13

argument of the Government, Your Honor, and our response

14

is that bankruptcy historically alters debtor-creditor

15

relationships as a matter of fact in every single case,

16

and burdens of persuasion which exist outside of a

17

bankruptcy context and are meant to allocate risk, are

18

designed to allocate risk between litigants, we don't

19

think apply in a bankruptcy context when parties in

20

interest are different.

21

In a bankruptcy context this Court has found

22

repeatedly it transfers claims against the debtor, legal

23

claims against that debtor, to equitable claims against

24

assets which comprise a bankruptcy estate.

It's no longer

Stoecker.

2

outside of bankruptcy, like most taxing authorities,

3

because tax claims by and large, unless they're extremely

4

stale, are nondischargeable under section 520(p)

5

irrespective of whether a proof of claim is ever filed or

6

allowed.

7

They have the ability to continue to do that

QUESTION:

True, but I mean, I'm not sure that

8

that gets to the, really to the heart of the point, that

9

by adjusting, we'll say, the relations of fairness as

10

between the original parties, the original taxpayer and

11

the Government, you are in fact, or you would in fact,

12

under the Bankruptcy Code, be changing the nature of the

13

claim because you simply cannot understand the claim

14

except in terms of who has the burden.

15

If the Government has the burden, it doesn't

16

have that much of a claim because it simply doesn't have

17

access to the means of showing it, and so it seems to me

18

that the meat of their argument really is not affected by

19

the fact that we have a slight shift in the actual parties

20

to the relationship here.

21

The meat of their argument is, the claim itself

22

would be changed if you changed the burden, regardless of

23

who happens to be fighting about it at a given time, and

24

I'm not sure that you really responded to that.

MR. RADASEVICH:

Your Honor, if you start with

1

the presumption that the Government's claim is based --

2

their tax claim is based upon something, often their

3

internal audits and internal assessments, if we look at

4

what happens when they file a claim under section -- under

5

the Bankruptcy Code, and the prima facie validity of that

6

claim that ascribes under section 3 -- under Bankruptcy

7

Rule 3001(f), it's not the Government's initial burden at

8

that point to do anything.

9

The burden's on whoever the objecting party is,

10

be it the taxpayer, a creditor, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy

11

trustee, or a creditor's committee, to introduce an

12

argument, evidence of an argument of equal probative

13

value, which is the standard that a lot of courts talk

14

about when they talk about displacing the prima facie

15

validity of the claim in order to shift the -- to make the

16

creditor, the taxing authority come up with additional

17

evidence to prove its claim, so it --

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Radasevich, I think you're now

19

talking about the distinction between the burden of coming

20

forward, which you concede that the taxpayer would have,

21

and the ultimate burden of persuasion, but it is the

22

ultimate burden of persuasion that's critical here, and

23

why isn't it part and parcel of the substantive right?

24

That is, this is not just any general rule about burden of

25

persuasion.

This is a rule that is stuck together with a

1

certain kind of claim.

2

This is a rule not for claims generally, but for

3

tax cases,

so we tend to think of built-in statutes of

4

limitations, rules about processing,

5

go together, that we have in other contexts called part

6

and parcel of the substantive right, and so it doesn't

7

answer that question to say, well, the taxpayer would have

8

a burden of coming forward.
MR. RADASEVTCH:

9

if you will, but that

Justice Ginsburg,

I think that

10

the burden of proof attendant to tax claims is as much

11

substantive of those claims as the burden of proof on any

12

other claim.

13

Congress and State governments, State

14

legislatures have decided that because of certain policy

15

reasons the burden of persuasion on an assortment of

16

different tax claims should be borne on the taxpayer

17

rather than the taxing authority.

18

are generally recordkeeping requirements,

19

documentation, and knowledge about the underlying tax

20

claim.

burden of persuasion on a taxing authority in a bankruptcy

22

estate because of the way claims are adjudicated in

in

1

order to counter the prima facie validity of the claim, we

2

think those same purposes are served.

3

For example, in Landbank, the decision that

4

holds that the burden of persuasion is on the taxpayer, on

5

the objecting party in bankruptcy, in that case the taxing

6

authority filed a proof of claim and based upon an

7

estimated valuation of bad loss, bad debt losses, the

8

objecting trustee said no, you should figure -- you should

9

determine bad debt losses based upon the actual accounting

10

method, but the Court's opinion indicates that nobody had

11

any records of what the bad debt losses under the actual

12

accounting method was.

13

In that instance, the objecting creditor failed

14

to rebut the presumption of the taxing authority's case.

15

The taxing authority's case in Landbank, the taxing

16

authority would have won even if the burden of persuasion

17

would have been on the taxing authority, because the

18

debtor, without adequate records, without justifiable

19

evidence to rebut the presumption, can't overcome the

20

validity of the tax claim.

21

QUESTION:

Well, did the objector here introduce

22

some sort of evidence of the kind you're talking about?

23

Somewhere in these opinions one of the courts says there's

24

virtually no evidence on the subject either way.

Revenue's evidence consisted of the notice of penalty or

I mean, what about the objector?

You say that person at least has to come in with a

plausible argument.

MR. RADASEVICH:

QUESTION:

8

MR. RADASEVICH:

9

Yes, Your Honor.

Was that done here?
Yes, Your Honor.

The evidence

that was submitted by -- on behalf of the trustee was an

10

opinion of counsel of the target company, Chandler

11

Enterprises, that the subject transaction was exempt from

12

taxes as an occasional sale.

13

They also have the certificate of exemption from

14

the seller indicating that it had only sold one airplane,

15

ever, and it was an -- this was an exempt sale.

17

arguments, and the testimony of Mr. Prewitt from the

18

leasing company supporting those arguments.

19

It also

What the Illinois Department of Revenue had, as

20

indicated by Brenda Thompson, her testimony, was, when

21

Chandler never responded to the notice of tax liability

22

against it because it was only a shell and its principal

23

was in bankruptcy, it checked with the Illinois Secretary

24

of State and found out that Mr. Stoecker was an officer

25

and director, as was an individual named Larry Pluhar.

1

Based upon that evidence and that evidence

2

alone, when they didn't respond to letters they issued

3

notice of penalty and liabilities against Mr. Stoecker and

4

Mr. Pluhar with zero evidence that they were, in fact,

5

responsible or, in fact, willful, so we believe that the

6

evidence that we offered, which was the opinion letters

7

and the certificates and the testimony, was sufficient to

8

rebut the presumption of the validity -- was at least

9

equal to the probative value of the --

10

QUESTION:

Why didn't you just call him to the

11

stand, Stoecker, and say, look, did you get the letters to

12

the lawyer?

13

in Illinois?

14

would have won.

15

Yes.
No.

Okay, thank you very much, and then you

So why -- I mean, it -- what Justice Souter

16

said, I don't see that it makes much difference where the

17

burden of proof is, frankly, and this seems like a case

18

that illustrates that, and on the state of mind, where

19

it's willful, I mean, you'd think that Mr. Stoecker was

20

the best -- is the best witness in respect to that, and if

21

he doesn't show up, you begin to get suspicious.

10

There was some judge in this case who

said, this is a case where there are gaps in the evidence,

and it's one of those cases where the burden of persuasion

is determinative.

MR. RADASEVICH:

Judge Squires, Your Honor.

He was the bankruptcy judge,

sufficient to rebut the presumption.

QUESTION:

Of course, the Congress didn't say

anything about affirmative defenses, either.
MR. RADASEVICH:

It did in section 547, Your

7

Honor, which deals with preferences, and there's a burden

8

of proof allocation in section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code

9

where Congress says that basically the trustee or the

10

plaintiff has the burden of persuasion on the prima facie

11

elements of a preference claim, and it's up to the

12

defendant to have the burden of proof -- they never say

13

persuasion -- burden of proof on the subsection (c)

14

matters which are in the nature of affirmative defenses,

15

that it was in the ordinary course of business, et cetera.

16

QUESTION:

You say that the other creditors have

17

to prove their claims.

18

suppose you could have another State law that gave some

19

creditors other than the taxing authority the same kind of

20

benefit that you're fighting here.

21

suppose there is a State law that does not require another

creditor to bear the burden of proof.

There was a case --

There is a Due Process Clause that

MR. RADASEVICH:

There are presumptions that

12

arise in certain Federal taxing concepts.

13

under the Black Lung Act, something called the true doubt

14

rule, that if somebody works in the mine for 40 years and

15

gets lung disease, pretty good bet it's a result of him

working in the mine.

There's one

The Court, though, in a decision the name of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. BENJAMIN GOLDGAR

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GOLDGAR:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to begin by clearing up one area of

12

13

potential confusion, and that has to do with the

14

difference between, if there is a difference between the

15

validity of a claim and the allowance of a claim.

16

Mr. Radasevich said that validity is not the same as

17

allowance.

That is both true and untrue.
Allowance can mean more than validity,

18
19

certainly.

There are reasons under section 502 of the

20

code for disallowing a claim that have nothing to do with

21

its validity, but validity is itself a reason for

22

disallowing a claim.

23

trustee in this case challenged the claim.

24

trustee's assertion that the Department of Revenue's claim

25

was not valid under State law.

It was, in fact, the reason why the
It was the

Under Illinois tax law, he

1

contended, we did not have a claim.

In that instance,

2

validity is indeed the same as allowance.
Now, to make matters more complicated and talk

3
4

about how allowance is used in the Vanston case, under the

5

Act, as opposed to under the Code, allowance meant

6

something else again.

7

sense that it's used in section 502, but it also

8

incorporated notions of equitable subordination, so that

It not only meant allowance in the

the Vanston case -- and I can't speak to why it wasn't
10

cited in the Butner decision, but it was cited in the

11

opinion that Justice Stevens wrote in Grogan v. Garner.

12

In Vanston, the Court first observed that the

13

validity of a claim -- I believe they termed it existence,

14

but that's really the same thing.

15

claim is a matter of State law except where there is

16

overruling Federal law, but the Court went on to say that

17

essentially the equivalent of equitable subordination

18

applied, and that is that it was unfair to allow these

1

particular creditors interest on interest at the expense

20

of other creditors, so in this case we are talking about

21

allowance.

22

The existence of a

We are also talking about validity.
The trustee in this case is asking the Court to

23

do something that we contend is pretty radical and that

24

is, in the face of congressional silence and ignoring the

25

vital interest that States have in the integrity of their

tax schemes, he's asking the Court essentially to fashion

2

a Federal common law burden of proof only, apparently, for

3

tax claims and only in bankruptcy.

4

claims would be decided differently in bankruptcy court

5

than in State court.
QUESTION:

6

Under his rule, tax

I thought, Mr. Goldgar, that

7

Mr. Radasevich had said if there were other claims that

8

were like the tax claims, his rule would be the same, but

9

he said on inspection there weren't many, that most of the

10

others were affirmative defense cases.
MR. GOLDGAR:

11

Yes, he did say that, as a matter

12

of fact.

13

other burdens of proof that are similar, we believe the

14

rule he is asking for would only have an impact on tax

15

creditors.

16

I stand corrected.

benefit of all other creditors in bankruptcy, and that

class of creditors that is disadvantaged is, in fact, a

3

class of creditors that is ordinarily favored in

bankruptcy.

QUESTION:

that the burden of proof, or the burden of persuasion is

part of the substantive law that governs the claim.

MR. GOLDGAR:

Yes, that -- we do assume that.

We think that's an accurate statement of the law.
QUESTION:

But you're -- I mean, I don't think

11

it's fair to say that the trustee here is asking to single

12

out for some discriminatory treatment one particular class

13

of creditors.

Well, I don't --

MR. GOLDGAR:

QUESTION:

Well, let me -

The argument being made is, this is a

20

very strange provision that does not exist in the common

21

law normally and the purpose of it is to enable the

22

Government, which normally does not have in its control

23

the documents necessary to prove its case, to collect

24

taxes that are due, and that when you shift over into a

bankruptcy context the situation changes.

It's not the

of the necessary documents than the Government is.

3

the other creditors are no more in control

MR. GOLDGAR:

Let me answer that a couple of

4

ways.

The first is, tax creditors do have to prove their

5

claims.

6

way State law required that we prove it.

7

with the certified record of our proceedings, which in

8

this instance, with an unavailable taxpayer,

9

essentially --

We had to prove our claim here.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. GOLDGAR:

12

QUESTION:

We proved it the
We proved it

That's playing word games.
Well --

I mean, you had to prove it the way

13

the State law said you had to prove it, which is not the

14

way everybody else has to prove it, that is, by a

15

preponderance of the evidence, right?

16

MR. GOLDGAR:

That's the burden of proof,

17

though, that attaches to their claim, whatever it may be.

18

This is the burden -- and therefore that's --

19

QUESTION:

But this is a distinctive burden of

20

proof that has been singled out for tax claims, and the

21

argument being made is, there are good reasons for that,

22

but those reasons don't apply in bankruptcy, and therefore

23

this particular very weird element of, you don't have to

24

bear the burden of proving your claim, should not be

carried over into bankruptcy law, and there were many

1

courts that came out that way under the old Bankruptcy

2

Act, and Collier on Bankruptcy, the only bankruptcy

3

authority I ever used, agreed with that.

4

MR. GOLDGAR:

Well, some courts came out that

5

way and many courts did not.

6

really suggesting here is that in bankruptcy we can end up

7

doing a kind of ad hoc balancing and determine whether we

8

like or dislike the substantive law attendant to a

9

particular creditor's claim when we're deciding the

10

validity of that claim.
In this instance it apparently, according to the

11
12

district court, was simply deemed to be unfair to the

13

other creditors to allow tax creditors to have the benefit

14

of their burden of proof.

15

QUESTION:

Yes, but that's -- look, he had very

16

good answers to my questions.

17

following up on what Justice Scalia says, it seemed to me

18

fairly easy, this case, because it seemed like there are a

19

lot of instances in which you go into bankruptcy and

20

really it's not the creditor that has to prove the claim,

1

And then he had -- his second answer was, look,

2

when you shift the burden of proof in an ordinary

3

nonbankruptcy context, obviously the taxpayer can go in

4

and declare his state of mind, for example, or the

5

records, but here it's not the taxpayer who's at issue.

6

It's, let's say the widows and orphans who are the other

7

creditors, and they have no easier access to that taxpayer

than you do.

access, so why shouldn't you have to call Mr. Stoecker in

You all start out with the same nonaccess or

10

just as you're saying they should have to call

12

So if there's no tradition, and if the reason

disappears, why should you win?

objecting party, and a trustee who happens to have no

2

records, despite efforts on both sides to get them,

3

because we had a taxpayer who was under indictment and

4

eventually convicted of a crime.
But that isn't always going to be the case.

5

In

6

most instances it won't be, and if the burden of proof is

7

a legal rule, do we want bankruptcy courts making what are

8

essentially ad hoc balancing determinations before we ever

9

even get into the litigation of the claim.
QUESTION:

10

I don't understand why you claim it's

11

an ad hoc balancing.

It's who has the burden of proof.

12

don't see that that's ad hoc balancing.
Let me ask you something else.

The taxes that

14

the State wants presumably are exempt from any debtor's

QUESTION:

This is a nondischargeable debt.

2

MR. GOLDGAR:

Two points about that.

First,

though nondischargeable, if it's disallowed in the

bankruptcy, presumably that would mean that we have no

5

claim.

I don't imagine that we would -QUESTION:

6

But if you never made a claim through

7

the bankruptcy proceeding, presumably the State can always

8

go after the taxpayer.

9

MR. GOLDGAR:

Well, in that event, Justice

10

O'Connor, the Government is put to an impossible choice,

11

because in that instance we either have to choose,

12

apparently, between making our claim in the bankruptcy and

13

suffering a different burden of proof than we would have

14

if we made the claim in the State court, or waiting until

15

the bankruptcy is concluded, in which case the assets have

16

been distributed hither and yon, and --

17

QUESTION:

Why can't you do both?

I mean, if

18

there is a different burden of proof, I mean, res judicata

they're different burdens.

tax authorities and to providing an incentive for the

2

maintenance of adequate records to enable fair

3

determinations of tax liabilities to be made.
Now, the court of appeals was quite correct in

4
5

pointing out that the code addresses burden of persuasion

6

in a number of contexts but not with respect to burden of

7

persuasion on tax claims, and referred to its silence as

8

eloquent.

9

silence that implies an answer to this.

10

Actually, there is perhaps something more than

Tax claims arise in bankruptcy proceedings

11

sometimes in the form of judgments that have been

12

adjudicated by tax tribunals, whether State or Federal,

13

but have not yet been paid, and sometimes as claims that

14

have not been reduced to judgment, and in the section of

15

the code, section 505 of title XI, entitled Determination

16

of Tax Liability, Congress explicitly addresses the

17

situation when a tax claim is reflected in a judgment.

18

As the court of appeals pointed out, section

19

(a) (1) , subsection (a) (1) of section 505, a provision

20

which is cited in the briefs but not set forth in the

21

briefs, does give the -- a bankruptcy court authority to

determine the amount or legality of any tax except as

23

provided in paragraph 2, and paragraph 2 of section 505(a)

4

Then that judgment is

Now, two observations might be made about this

5

in a search for congruity in administration of the

6

bankruptcy proceedings themselves with respect to tax

7

claims, first that by 1978, when these provisions were

8

enacted in the code, it was very familiar where the burden

9

of proof lies in these tax adjudications and Congress was

10

comfortable in giving conclusive effect to those that have

11

been adjudicated in a tribunal.

12

But the other, rather strong implication is that

13

the bankruptcy court is being told it's bound by those

14

determinations, but when those determinations have not

15

been made by a tax tribunal, then the implication, it

16

seems to us, is that the bankruptcy court should be acting

17

as the surrogate for the tribunal that ordinarily makes

18

these tax determinations and should try to reach the

19

result that would otherwise be binding in the bankruptcy

20

proceedings in the spirit of Erie Railroad v. Tompkins.

21

This is a question governed by tax law, whether

22

State or Federal, in this case State tax law, and you try

23

to reach the result that the tribunal that can speak

24

authoritatively for the State government in this case

What petitioner is arguing for is a rule that

1

2

would encourage the reaching of disparate results,

3

depending on which tribunal is making the determination, a

4

return to a pre-Erie kind of administration of the law,

5

which would destroy congruity in the achievement of

6

results here.
QUESTION:

7

Mr. Wallace, it's not just Erie, is

8

it?

As I understand it, in choice of law generally the

9

burden of persuasion would go with the substantive right,

10

so if we were making a State-State judgment, and Illinois

11

is applying the law of Indiana to a particular claim, with

12

that law would go Indiana's burden of proof and not

13

Illinois, so it's not just a vertical Erie, but a

14

determinations when they're really determining something

19

1

Bankruptcy Code to encourage disparate results, depending

2

on which tribunal has made the determination, when

3

Congress quite explicitly said that if it has gone to

4

determination before the normal tax tribunals which apply

5

the normal burden of persuasion in tax cases, that will be

6

binding in the bankruptcy proceeding.

7

There should be some reason before we should

8

read the companion provision, which says nothing about

9

burden of persuasion, to encourage the bankruptcy court,

10

when it has to step in as the surrogate for the normal tax

11

tribunals, to reach different results by applying

12

different ways of determining the tax liability.

13

In fact, occasionally bankruptcy courts, when

14

there's a particularly complicated tax question, will lift

15

the automatic stay, as they're authorized to do to enable

16

a tax court proceeding to go ahead to a conclusion because

17

they feel that the tax court can make a more accurate

18

determination on a complex tax issue, and then under this

19

provision that will be the binding determination for the

20

bankruptcy proceeding.

21

So what's really being advocated here is an

22

incongruity in reaching results with respect to tax

23

claims, because they often come before the court with a

24

preexisting, embodied preexisting judgment which Congress

25

has taken no chances on here, but has said will be

2

any other determination with respect to the tax liability.
QUESTION:

I'm not sure that's an incongruity.

It seems to me quite Congress to say judgments are

7

MR. WALLACE:

of the claim and it's often argued that they're res

kinds of judgments.

But they'd be bound by other sorts of

17

judgments on some issues which, if the -- if there had not

20

determine that issue differently from the way the State

court -- I mean, let's assume it wasn't an issue of burden

22

of persuasion, but an issue of, I don't know, something

23

that the forum decides.

We're

1

looking for what Congress might have intended here, and

2

the fact that there was this explicit provision is of some

3

importance, and there would be some question whether, if

4

there were actually a different burden of persuasion,

5

ordinary principles of res judicata would carry over, and

yet explicitly the bankruptcy court is not to redetermine

a question of tax liability that's embodied in a judgment,

MR. RADASEVICH:

Thank you, Your Honor.

15

I'd like to address one point during my

16

rebuttal, and that's the other five code sections which --

17

in which Congress did, in fact, determine an allocation of

18

the burden of persuasion.

19

The first three are instances where Congress

20

allocated the burden to two separate parties in litigation

21

on different things that were involved in the matter.

22

Under section 547, as I discussed with Justice Ginsburg,

23

the prima facie proof is on the plaintiff, the affirmative

24

defenses are on the defendant.

25

Under section 362, dealing with modification of

the automatic stay, the movant has certain burdens, the

2

debtor has other burdens.

3

Under section 363, dealing with the use, sale,

4

and lease of property, the debtor has certain burdens

5

where the trustee, the party asserting an interest in the

6

property has other burdens.

7

So Congress split the burdens because there were

a bunch of things going on.

claim objections.

proceeding in the Illinois Tax Commission, or whatever

15

MR. RADASEVICH:

It was a claim that had not

of the NPL, which is the assessment.

In which case the burden would have
