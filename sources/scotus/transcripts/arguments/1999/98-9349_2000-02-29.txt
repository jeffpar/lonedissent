CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

v. The United States.

Ms. Fuentes.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. CAROLYN FUENTES

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. FUENTES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Mr. Bond's case presents the question whether a

12

search occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when a

13

law enforcement officer manipulates a bus passenger's

14

carry-on luggage to determine its contents.

15

manipulation of luggage is not a search, then law officers

16

will be able to squeeze and feel carry-on luggage, as

17

Agent Cantu did in Mr. Bond's case, free from judicial

18

scrutiny in criminal cases and without any Fourth

19

Amendment requirement that their actions be reasonable.

20

If

Over 30 years ago, in Terry v. Ohio, this Court

21

said that it is sheer torture of the English language to

22

suggest that a careful exploration all over the outer

23

clothing of a person's body is not a search.

24

be said in this case.

25

those in Dickerson v. Minnesota, govern this case.

The same can

The principles in Terry, as well as

Now, the Government says that they do not and

1

2

says, instead, this Court's public exposure cases govern

3

the determination in Mr. Bond's case.

4

Government's argument is that it fails to recognize that

5

on the line between Dickerson and Terry on the one hand

6

and the public exposure cases on the other, Mr. Bond's

7

case falls far closer to the facts, circumstances, and

8

legal principles in Dickerson and in Terry.

The flaw in the

For example, Terry and Dickerson involved

10

searches of outer clothing being worn by a person.

11

clothing, the pockets of outer clothing in particular,

12

serve the function of being a repository of personal

13

effects.

14

clothing, in our pockets.

15

Bond carried, serves the same function.

We commonly carry our personal effects on our

QUESTION:

A travel bag, like the one Mr.

But the difference -- the difference,

17

Ms. Fuentes, if there is one, I mean, the difference

18

asserted, is whether there's a reasonable expectation of

19

privacy, and you do have a reasonable expectation of

20

privacy in your clothing.

21

come up and frisk you.

MS. FUENTES:

You don't expect somebody to

expectation of privacy, your opponents will say, in a soft

6

reasonable expectation to be free from a Government

QUESTION:

10

We think that Mr. Bond did have a reasonable

But -- now, how can that be?

Did he

have a reasonable expectation other passengers would not
be able to feel the luggage and see what was in it?
MS. FUENTES:

11

He reasonably expected that other

12

passengers might push or move the luggage if they needed

13

to make room for their own, but that is not what Agent

14

Cantu did.

15

QUESTION:

They couldn't have squeezed it?

16

MS. FUENTES:

I think they could have squeezed

17

it, but again that is not what Agent Cantu did.

18

get on a bus and we put our luggage overhead, the

19

expectation is that if another passenger needs to come

20

aboard and needs room in that luggage bin, maybe he will

21

push it, maybe he will pull it, I think maybe he could

22

squeeze it.

QUESTION:

When we

But there are some nasty passengers

24

who may go beyond that.

Let's analogize it to the

25

situation where you leave your window shades up.

Now, you

1

don't expect your neighbors to peek into your room, but

2

you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy, and

3

the police are entitled to observe what is going on in the

4

room if you leave the shades up, isn't that right?

people to look into your room.

Now, it may be a nasty thing for

MS. FUENTES:

8

In that --

In that case, I think it's

correct, Your Honor, but I think one of the major

10

distinctions between Mr. Bond's case and the public

11

exposure cases are that in fact those observa -- the

12

observations in those cases and in the example that you

13

just gave took place from public thoroughfares, and this

14

Court has found that people don't have a reasonable

15

expectation to be free of visual observations made by

16

those who are in a vantage point where they have a right

17

to be.

18

That's -QUESTION:

contend -- well, you don't contend that the aisle of an

interstate bus is not a public place for this purpose?

observations from the aisle, we might have a bad case, but

he did not.

19

public to the extent of bus passengers were free to be,

just as the person who peeps in the window is doing so, on

21

your reasoning, from a place where that person has a right

to be.

Isn't that the point of the analogy?

What is crucial is not where

they were standing, but what they were doing.

11

MS. FUENTES:

12

QUESTION:

Correct.

Don't we draw a line between looking,

13

which is basically free, and feeling, which is not

14

basically free?

15

MS. FUENTES:

Yes, I would agree, and that is

16

another point that distinguishes Mr. Bond's case from the

17

public exposure cases.

18

QUESTION:

What do I do with the following

19

problem for me, which is, I fly quite a lot up to Boston

20

and so forth, and I put bags all the time in the upper

21

thing, and people are always moving them around.

22

push them, they lift them up, they move them to other

23

places, and if they're soft they would feel just what was

in the inside.

mine in, and I imagine the interstate bus here was no

2

different.
So if that happens all the time, how can I say

3
4

that your client has some kind of special expectation,

5

since in my own experience, people are always handling

6

this soft luggage?
MS. FUENTES:

7

I think that that experience is

8

the reasonable expectation.

They need to move the

9

luggage, and so they push it or they move it.

Agent Cantu

10

was not in that position.

11

you're on the plane and there are only three people on

12

there, and there's luggage down the hall and there's

13

luggage over your head, you don't expect that someone is

14

going to come into the plane and start squeezing and

15

moving your luggage when -QUESTION:

16

I'll give you an example.

If

Well, Ms. Fuentes, you know, we don't

17

have a lot of evidence here about exactly what Agent Cantu

18

did.

19

said only that Agent Cantu felt the bag, so we really

20

don't know what's involved, more than the passenger

21

shoving it around situation.

22

It's very sparse.

MS. FUENTES:

He felt -- the district court

I think -- excuse me, Your Honor.

23

I think we do have a good idea of what was involved if we

24

look at Agent Cantu's testimony itself.

25

he squeezed the bag, and he described what he felt.

Or is there something like an

those differences to which the law is blind, or am I wrong

about that?

No, I don't think the law is blind

QUESTION:

How do we distinguish the dog-sniff

12

cases, where we've upheld the use of police dogs to sniff

13

luggage for narcotics?

14

MS. FUENTES:

There are multiple factors, but I

15

think the most important one is that a dog-sniff is

16

incapable of revealing anything to the police except the

17

presence of contraband.

18

QUESTION:

Well, just to conclude my previous

19

question, do you submit the case on the proposition that

20

the purpose of the search, or, rather, the touching, is

irrelevant?

MS. FUENTES:

Yes, I hope so.

To the extent that the purpose

serves to describe what the officer has done, I think the

Court considers it.

one.

it because he's a busybody or whether a police officer

MS. FUENTES:

15

As to the garbage first, the

privacy interest in garbage is far different than the

different from the privacy interest in luggage.

MS. FUENTES:

QUESTION:

Is there -- I beg your pardon.

3

QUESTION:

But here, I think your case is

4

resting on the difference between ordinary pushing and

shoving and taking a bag and feeling around like this,

which, at least from my experience on airlines, doesn't

happen.

out and feel here and there.

People jam their stuff in.

They don't take it

That is one of the major points

10

upon which Mr. Bond's argument rests, and what Mr. Bond

11

did, Justice Breyer -- excuse me.

12

Mr. Bond's luggage that was different than what other

13

passengers do is demonstrated by the agent's testimony.

14

Any passenger pushing or pulling luggage, or even

15

squeezing luggage, grasping it, would not have been able

16

to discern the edges of a rectangular brick which had been

the same experience Mr. Cantu had, he now retired from the

MS. FUENTES:

No.

I think there's a difference.

2

I think Agent Cantu's experience is what led him to think

3

that what he felt was narcotics, but it's simply the same

4

sort of physical manipulation that anybody could use in

5

finding out what that brick felt like.

6

anyone, whether they'd been trained or not, can feel the

details that Agent Cantu described unless they are

manipulating that bag in a way that is significantly

different from the way passengers are reasonably expected

MS. FUENTES:

It is.
-- the issue in Mr. Bond's case

could be decided by saying, officers cannot squeeze bags.
QUESTION:

8

On the degree of manipulation point

and the questions put to you by Justice Stevens and
10

Justice Scalia, it does seem to me that a passenger does

11

not have the right to start manipulating my luggage to see

12

what's in it.

13

There's no asportation of the property.

14

not an assault, because an inanimate thing can't be

15

assaulted.
MS. FUENTES:

16
17

Is that a tort?

It's not a conversion.
I just -- it's

I'm not certain that it rises to

the level of a tort.

I'm not sure it does, although it

occurring there.
MS. FUENTES:

21

If the officer -- if Agent --

22

Agent Cantu took that bag and he converted it to his own

purpose.

24

wasn't so intrusive that it would be a conversion, but for

a dispossession of property in tort law there are some

It doesn't amount to a conversion because it

I don't know if it would rise to that level, but

2

I think the important point is that tort law provides a

3

privilege to Mr. Bond to stop even harmless interference

with is luggage.

5

QUESTION:

Did he object?

6

MS. FUENTES:

7

QUESTION:

No, he did not.

And how is it different physically

8

from, say, what happens occasionally -- one of the flight

9

attendants, or maybe a passenger will take my canvas bag

10

out, they'll be holding it, they'll move it to a different

11

compartment, they'll push it around, and I guess they can

12

feel something.

13

is it different from that?
MS. FUENTES:

Because Agent Cantu was able to

feel more than the actions you described -QUESTION:

that?

MS. FUENTES:

I think so, Your Honor, and I

4

think it goes back to expectations of privacy, and not to

6

purpose.

7

I think cannot rest on the extremes of conduct, because we

have to look at what we as a society, a civil society,

expects is the norm, and we expect that maybe the flight

But when a uniformed officer comes in and starts

squeezing all of the luggage, clearly from his actions you

14

can see he's trying to find out -- and I'm not talking

15

motive, I'm talking manner.

16

to find out what's in your luggage, that is an incredible

intrusion on personal security.

is.

think that can be discounted.

defense against others, is keeping his luggage with him.

to be able to feel things through it.
MS. FUENTES:

10

I -- he expects that if he doesn't

11

like the way people are feeling it, he can stop them, and

12

action by a police officer is different.

13

In addition to that, if you look at the way

Mr. Bond wrapped his methamphetamine brick, that wrapping

would have withstood any discoveries by passengers who are

moving luggage in the way that we would reasonably expect.

it if he wanted, I assume.

12

MS. FUENTES:

He had the right to do

I'm making that assumption.

I think he did have the right to

13

do it, but the difference is, Agent Cantu came on the bus

14

and started questioning people about their citizenship or

15

other right to be in the country.

16

He's demanding answers of them.

17

in an ugly way, but he is telling them, you must answer me

18

about your citizenship, and then, without a do-you-mind

QUESTION:

2

Did the expectation of privacy change

3

at the moment he saw the officer squeezing and he did not

object?

Is that relevant?
MS. FUENTES:

5

No.

I think that's when the

6

expectation of privacy was violated, when he saw the

7

officer squeezing.

8

that other passengers might move or push his luggage to

9

make room for their own, but it is very startling, and it

10

is an invasion of personal privacy, when a law officer

gets on and starts squeezing those bags.

Another example,

nothing?

to say, the terms of the bus travel in effect had changed

consented to a search under the Fourth Amendment, and the

Court has never accepted any less.

Now, in this case, let me return --

6

QUESTION:

There has

I suppose what we'd be saying -- I'm

7

not sure there's any authority for it -- is that your

8

expectation of privacy is reinforced by the fact that you

9

have at hand the means to protect it.

10

MS. FUENTES:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

Yes, I think that's correct.

And you haven't availed yourself of

that means.
MS. FUENTES:

Well, you haven't -- again, the

circumstances in this case are, you haven't availed

yourself of it because of the show of authority.

-- just as you expose yourself when

you put your trash out in containers that can be readily

opened and looked into.

MS. FUENTES:

Again, I find the difference

between luggage, which is meant to safeguard personal

belongings and kept close by, the difference between that

7

and former possessions that have been placed in a bag and

set on the street to be destroyed, to be -- it is a

9

qualitative difference that I think shows absolutely

10

different privacy interests.
In this case, again returning to privacy

11
12

interests, I think that if you were to see -- for example,

13

if there were a bored 15-year-old in the front of the bus,

14

tired of the layover, who decided to tap out a tune on the

15

bags in the overhead bins in time with the music he was

listening to, I think that would be an invasion of privacy

virtue of the kind of handling that's done?

9

think so.

10

MR. LAMKEN:

I wouldn't

That very well may occur, Justice

11

O'Connor, because when bags are so handled the sense of

12

touch inevitably operates, so if a passenger places his

13

hands on a piece of luggage to push it or snug it into the

14

rack, he may very well --

15

QUESTION:

Well, certainly you could, but I

16

would think there would a difference in the kind of

17

squeezing and manipulation that would occur to identify

18

objects within a bag than would occur normally when you

19

just move it to make more room for your own.

20

MR. LAMKEN:

That's possible, Your Honor.

The

21

distinction, however, and the principle that governs the

22

case, is one of knowing exposure.

member of the traveling public might have observed is

24

knowingly exposed, and the agent does not violate the

Fourth Amendment by observing it.

the agent can manipulate the bag in any way or for any

extended period of time.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Lamken, supposing the passenger

4

put a sign on his bag that said, fragile, please do not

touch?
MR. LAMKEN:

6

Your Honor, there's a very good

7

possibility that touching that bag notwithstanding the

8

sign would be a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth

9

Amendment.

I would have a very -- I would hesitate to

10

call it a search, on the other hand, because this cases --

11

this Court's cases in Oliver and Dunn, for example, make

12

it clear that violating signs on land that say, no

13

trespass, do not convert the entry on land into a search,

14

but it may very well be a meaningful deprivation of the

15

individual's possessory interest --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. LAMKEN:

QUESTION:

Is there --- it would be a search.
Is there a seizure or an invasion of

MR. LAMKEN:

there certainly wouldn't be any sort of tort, because

there is no damage to the chattel, the object was not

conduct there would be no trespass to chattel.

8

In addition, the tort of trespass to chattel
wouldn't occur if contact with the bag were privileged,

If there

1

was another person's bag under the seat, would it then be

okay to search it, or not?

3

MR. LAMKEN:

I think ordinarily, Justice

Stevens, the rule would be that the area under the seat in

front of you is reserved exclusively for your use and

6

possession.

7

It's part of your seat, effectively.

QUESTION:

What if the bus was empty, except

8

for -- and he had the choice of putting it in the seat or

9

an entirely overhead bin, and only one bag up there?

10

MR. LAMKEN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. LAMKEN:

Again, I think -What about that case?
The happenstance that the bus is

13

empty does not convert an area that is ordinarily shared

14

with other passengers --

15

QUESTION:

So even on an empty bus, if he made

16

the mistake of putting it up in the overhead bin he would

17

allow it to be searched, but if he put it under the seat,

18

it could avoid that?

19

MR. LAMKEN:

I think that would be correct, Your

20

Honor, because the area under the seat is reserved

21

exclusively for his use under most circumstances, and you

22

would not expect other passengers to be pushing or

touching or having contact with the bag in that area.

8

I think, Your Honor, in both cases

the question is one of knowing exposure.

Was there

something that any member of the traveling public, or any
10

other member of the traveling public could have observed

11

during handling of the bag?

12

then it's knowingly exposed and is not a subject of Fourth

13

Amendment protection.

14

QUESTION:

If the answer to that is yes,

You do want us to go into the degree

15

of manipulation, then, you're say.

16

decide, you know, whether a normal member of the traveling

17

public would have manipulated it to this degree.

18

MR. LAMKEN:

We're going to have to

No, I don't think that's the

1

inquiry, Justice Scalia.

I think the inquiry is one of

20

knowing exposure.

21

another member of the traveling public could have felt

22

while handling the bag, such as by pushing on it to snug

23

into the rack, or grabbing the bag to remove it from the

QUESTION:

2

MR. LAMKEN:

3

QUESTION:

Well, okay, suppose I say no.
Pardon me?
Suppose I -- if my answer to that

4

question is no, it would not have been discerned simply by

5

pushing or by grabbing, it would have taken -- it would

6

have had to be another member of the traveling public who

7

wanted to know what was in the bag, and who squeezed it to

8

figure it out, you say, if that's the case, you lose.
MR. LAMKEN:

10

Yes, I think we would lose if that

were the case, and -- now --

11

QUESTION:

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. LAMKEN:

14

QUESTION:

I think you may lose.

I don't think so, Justice Scalia.
I think you're making two different

15

assertions.

You're saying if the bag and its palpability

16

is knowingly exposed to the public, the police can take

17

advantage of that, and you're also saying that whatever

18

the public can do, the police can do, the public in this

19

case at least being fellow passengers.
In the latter example, the only thing that you

20
21

in effect consent or understand that your fellow

22

passengers will do will be to make room for their own

23

luggage.

24

passengers are going to work their way up and down the bus

25

feeling other people's luggage to see if anything

interesting turns up.

So if the criterion, it seems to

2

me, is what other passengers can do, then what this

3

officer was doing was outside of that, and would be

4

outside the reasonable expectation.

5

On the other hand, if you abstract from that and

6

say, anything that could be felt by the public can be felt

7

by the police, you're at a different level of generality,

8

and I guess my question is, why should we take the
abstract proposition, anything feelable can be felt by the

10

police, as opposed to your other proposition, that what

11

the passengers can do the police can do?

12

one rather than the other to answer the question of what

13

is a reasonable expectation?
MR. LAMKEN:

Why do we choose

You would choose the latter, for --

15

because it's consistent with this Court's cases, for

think you're going to feel that a different value is

7

involved, and for that reason I don't see how you can

8

equate looking with touching.
MR. LAMKEN:

9

Well, the two -- the same Fourth

10

Amendment principles apply to both cases, but they may

11

turn out to yield different results.

12

fewer --

QUESTION:

There are many

Well, the basic principle is one of

reasonable expectation, and the reasonable expectation in

looking, or being seen, is different from the reasonable

explored by someone who is touching to find out what he

18

can feel.

there are many circumstances where one would knowingly

expose their person, for example, to visual observation,

the purpose with which someone is acting.

20

We say the very fact that you may have a law

Take a nonlaw enforcement example.

MR. LAMKEN:

Your Honor, we don't believe that

respect to handling of checked luggage, either.
QUESTION:

6

No, no, not checked.

It's just, you

7

know, on the -- you -- the driver, the bus driver often

8

will take the luggage from the passenger and put it in

9

kind of a bin under the truck, and then when they get to

10

the destination they unload it all out together, and you

11

pick out your bag.
Now, would they -- would the -- would your agent

13

have a right to say to the driver, I want to go through

MR. LAMKEN:

I don't think you

would normally expect the bus driver to do it.

No, Your Honor.

So if it's closed overhead, he can

look at it, but if it's closed under the bus, he cannot?

MR. LAMKEN:

I don't think that's the critical

factor.

MR. LAMKEN:

That's an entirely different case.
On an airline, sometimes larger

Well, the question is, would it be

constitutional if he did?
MR. LAMKEN:

Unless the bus driver is a

What does it matter whether it's only

MR. LAMKEN:

QUESTION:

Well, I think -You have given up -- on your theory,

7

you've given up your right to demand privacy, and if the

law enforcement officer in effect can share in what the

fellow passenger can do, why can't he share in what the

bus driver can do?
MR. LAMKEN:

QUESTION:

4

So in effect I guess you're saying

5

that the general expectations of what will happen, and oy

6

whom things will be done, matters.

7

MR. LAMKEN:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes, I think that's correct.
And if it matters, why doesn't it

matter that the only general expectation is that a fellew

10

passenger may move the luggage in order to get his luggage

11

in?

That's all you expect.
MR. LAMKEN:

12
13

Well, I think you expect other

passengers to have contact with your bag.
QUESTION:

14
15

Why isn't that relevant?

No, I don't expect other passengers

to walk through the bus and feel my luggage gratuitously.
QUESTION:

16

And isn't that because the general

principle of law is, you cannot touch another person's

MR. LAMKEN:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF M. CAROLYN FUENTES

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

23

MS. FUENTES:

I think overall, Your Honor,

24

the -- all of the Government's argument is based on the

25

knowing exposure of Mr. Bond's bag,

and those cases tha;

1

this Court has decided on knowing exposure vary so

2

radically from Mr. Bond's situation that they should no:

3

be applied.

4

That public exposure principle has been applied

5

primarily for visual observations with very limited

6

exceptions, the garbage case, for example, and luggage .s

7

different than garbage, and I believe Maryland v. Macon

8

where police officers went into a store where people were

9

invited to buy, and they bought.

10
11

So they touched it, tiey

bought, they did just what the public could do.
But on that line, what happened to Mr. Bond was

12

much closer to Dickerson and to Terry, and so the public

13

exposure principle should not be applied.

14

limited public access principles in Mancuson v. DeForte

15

for example, just because other people have access to oir

16

office doesn't mean that the police can have access, those

17

principles, as well as Dickerson and Terry, are more

18

applicable in this case.

19

Instead, the

I also wanted to say one thing about purpose,

20

and that is that purpose can be instructive if it is

21

manifested by objective actions, and that purpose is whit

22

helps to define reasonable expectations.

that other passengers may move our luggage for the purpose

24

We do expect

violated.
More than 30 years ago, in Terry, this Court had

2

3

to decide whether it wanted to isolate an entire range of

4

police conduct from Fourth Amendment constraints, and

5

really much the same question is before the Court today.

6

Will the police be permitted to manipulate luggage

7

basically as much as they want under the Government's

8

theory?

9

If anything could have been observed by a member

10

of the public, then the police are entitled to observe it.

11

Will they be able to do that outside the constraints of

12

the Fourth Amendment, and I think the answer should be no.

13

Unless the court has any more questions --

14

QUESTION:

Well, I'll ask you one -- I mean,

15

when I came into this, I thought, well, it isn't that

16

hard.

17

whether, when you put this luggage up in a place, you have

18

a reasonable expectation that somebody could go and feel

19

the brick, and if the answer's yes, then he has no

20

expectation.

21

Maybe it is harder, but the real question's just

The answer's no, he does.

All right, now, on that theory the only way --

22

the answer must be yes, there's a good chance somebody

23

would feel the brick unless it requires a special hard

24

touch, all right?

25

MS. FUENTES:

Yes.

1

QUESTION:

Now what?

2

MS. FUENTES:

I'm not sure.

Well, I think the answer is, the

3

reason they will do it is to move their luggage, and your

4

expectations would be violated if it were an empty bus and

5

someone came and started touching your luggage anyway, and

6

when our reasonable expectations of privacy are violated

7

by private persons, that doesn't matter for Fourth

8

Amendment purposes.

9

But when the Government does it, and Agent Cantu

10

did it in this case, that is covered by the Fourth

11

Amendment, and unless it is done with some sort of

12

individualized suspicion, it is a violation of the Fourth

13

Amendment.
