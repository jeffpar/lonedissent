Mr. Barnico.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A. BARNICO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. BARNICO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Massachusetts law challenged in this case is

11

similar to the selective purchasing policies adopted by

12

many States, cities, and private institutions in the

13

1980's regarding South Africa.

14

1990's, Congress addressed both South Africa and Burma,

15

but took no action to expressly prohibit to the States or

16

individuals the right to make choices about their vendors

17

taking into account matters involving a foreign country.

Through the 1980's and

18

We think that Congress has not expressly denied

19

to us the right to make this choice, because it believes,

20

as we do, that these laws serve important national and

21

local interest.

22

debate over important questions of foreign policy.

23

is a local interest as well, the interest in

24

disassociating States and State tax funds from the

25

indirect support of brutal regimes abroad.

There is a national interest in vigorous

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Barnico, would you take the same

2

position if Massachusetts decided it didn't like another

3

State's death penalty policy and wanted to discourage it

4

and said, we're not going to let anybody spend State money

5

to buy anything if the seller has anything to do with the

6

other State?

7

MR. BARNICO:

Not if the law regulated our

8

citizens in that way, but if it were expending our own

9

funds, as it is in this case, we would consider that to be

10

proprietary as well under our definition.

11

that we don't think it would be a usual case at all, given

12

the comity and respect each State ordinarily shows each

13

other.
QUESTION:

14

We quickly add

Well, isn't the Gould case somewhat

15

against you on this point, or the Wisconsin Department of

16

Labor?

17

anyone who has violated an NLRB order and they said, we're

18

just expending our own money, and this Court said, you may

19

be spending your own money but that's -- what they said

20

was, tantamount to regulation.

21

It said that Wisconsin is not going to buy from

MR. BARNICO:

Well, we think there, and the

22

difference with Gould and this case, is the fact that the

23

Court saw a nexus between the regulatory scheme imposed by

24

Federal law and the State action that was at issue.

25

give the Court an example of what might be closer to Gould

To

1

than our case would be if Massachusetts had somehow tied

2

its purchasing decisions to violation of the Federal ban

3

on new investment in Burma.
There, there might be more of a nexus between

4
5

the regulatory scheme on the one hand --we think it was

6

the close connection between the Wisconsin scheme on the

7

one hand and the Federal complete scheme of regulation of

8

the labor field that made the Court decide that we were

9

regulatory in nature.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Barnico, would it make any

11

difference in your analysis if the country with which we

12

were dealing were not Burma but, say, Austria, or

13

Switzerland?
MR. BARNICO:

14

The country wouldn't matter, Your

15

Honor, except insofar as some Federal law or treaty

16

established relations between the United States and the

17

country --

18

QUESTION:

So that a State would be free to

19

decide what country it believed is violating some human

20

rights norm, be it Austria, be it Burma?

21

MR. BARNICO:

That's right, except insofar as a

22

plausible argument could be made that we were preempted by

23

a Federal law or treaty on the point.

24

heart of our case, that absent the force of enacted law

25

through the Supremacy Clause, such a choice by a State

should not be displaced by the Foreign Commerce Clause or

2

the dormant foreign affairs power.

QUESTION:

Do you think that Congress --

QUESTION:

Would your answer be the same if two

5

States had different policies?

6

buy not from mainland China but Taiwan, and the others

7

state just the opposite.

8

the point, States are free to do that, and to have

9

differing policies?

10

MR. BARNICO:

One State says, we will

Absent Federal legislation on

That's right, Your Honor.

At some

11

point the differing policies becomes to the attention of

12

Congress, and Congress, which has the preeminent voice in

13

foreign affairs, would decide whether the national

14

interest requires a rule of uniformity, but absent that

15

action, or absent some question of a treaty, the States

16

would be free to act indirectly in this way.

17

QUESTION:

I'm not sure it's realistic to expect

18

the Congress to exercise this ongoing supervision over

19

every local ordinance, over every State statute, and it

20

certainly is inconsistent with what the Federalist Papers

21

explain was the purpose of forming the Union itself.

22

MR. BARNICO:

Well, if I might address both of

23

those points, Your Honor, the first is on the question of

24

the proliferation of these laws.

25

that we're acting against our own economic interest here.

We have to keep in mind

1

Massachusetts is paying the price, bearing the burden to

2

speak out on this question.

3

principle will be limiting, because it will limit those

4

instances in which a State or local government which is to

5

act against its own interest and act in the way that's

6

challenged here.

Since that's the case, our

Furthermore, Congress will be aware, presumably,

7
8

in the event that a controversy arises due to the

9

conflicting actions of the States as you mentioned, and

10

it's also worth noting, finally, on the proliferation

11

question, that even at high tide in the eighties with

12

South Africa it was 20 States, approximately 100 cities,

13

so I think the parade of horribles that's raised by the

14

other side here about the numerous jurisdictions isn't

15

realistic.

16

QUESTION:

Well, here Congress has actually

17

enacted a law dealing with this precise problem, an area

18

of trade with Burma, has it not?

19

MR. BARNICO:

It has enacted a law imposing

20

Federal sanctions on Burma --

21

QUESTION:

MR. BARNICO:

Yes.

23

American nationals in that country.

however, about State and local action, and we think the

25

question of preemption --

It says nothing,

QUESTION:

1

Oh, but isn't that kind of similar to

2

what happened in the Hines v. Davidowitz case back in '41,

3

when Pennsylvania had a law dealing with what resident

4

aliens had to have to be in that State, and it was

5

possible, certainly, for a resident alien to comply both

6

with the Federal law and the State law, and yet that was

7

stricken, wasn't it?
MR. BARNICO:

8

9

Yes, Your Honor, but we think that

the key phrase from our point of view and Hines would be

10

the reference to a complete scheme of regulations that was

11

in issue there in Hines.

12

field has been occupied by the Federal action, that the

13

Federal action here must be read in light of the

14

experience of the 1980's.

That is, the inference that the

Our point is that Congress knew well that State

15
16

and local actions of this type were enacted throughout the

17

country in the 1980's.

18

sanctions against Burma arose in 1996, it acted against

19

that backdrop.

20

in fact, and we think this very interesting evidence, in

21

1993, when Congress repealed the sanctions against South

22

Africa, it merely encouraged the States to act as to their

23

own laws.

25

Then, when the question of

It had tolerated these types of laws and,

Well, the Federal Government would

be run by Congress stepping in in the event -QUESTION:

No, no, I mean, the Federal -- in

other words, in your view, California could say, we will

not buy any textbooks from Addison-Wesley for the reason

17

that we don't like Massachusetts policies in respect to

the environment, or we don't like their policy -- they

Your Honor.

We think they should.

It's still a choice by the State acting --

is that the Constitution would permit that under the

safeguard included in the document to allow Congress to

act in the event the national interest required.

3

QUESTION:

I assume California could, under our

4

decisions, decide to buy textbooks only from California

5

manufacturers.

Could it do that, in its purchasing?

6

MR. BARNICO:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

8

QUESTION:

So that's just as destructive of

9
10

That's right, Your Honor.
Yes.

national unity in a way, isn't it?
MR. BARNICO:

Right, but the holdings of the

11

Court regarding market participation say that whatever the

12

effects of such a law, whatever the question of national

13

interest or uniformity, the dormant Foreign Commerce

14

Clause in that case is not displacing of that type of

15

State choice.

16

It resembles that consumer choice.

QUESTION:

Well, surely there's a difference in

17

those two cases.

In the hypothetical Justice Scalia

18

proposes, California doesn't propose to regulate activity

19

and policies of other States.

20

MR. BARNICO:

21

QUESTION:

That's right.

So that's different from Justice

22

Breyer's hypothetical.

23

MR. BARNICO:

It is different to the

24

hypothetical, but the underlying point, of course, both as

25

to the dormant Commerce Clause in the hypotheticals and

1

the Foreign Commerce Clause that's at issue here, is that

2

those dormant clauses don't reach a certain limited sphere

3

of State activity in which the States can speak and act as

4

they have here.

5

That's really the point of our case.

QUESTION:

Do you concede that there is a

6

dormant Commerce Clause principle in the international

7

area under the Foreign Commerce Clause?

8

MR. BARNICO:

We concede that the Court has

recognized in cases such as Barclays some foreign effect.
10

Our point here is that it must be considered and applied

11

with extreme caution in this case.

12

return to the historical point, the Framers specifically

13

identified those actions of a State that pose dangers in

14

their view to the national interest, so --

15

QUESTION:

That's because, to

Mr. Barnico, you mentioned before

16

that this case is different from Massachusetts, preferring

17

itself as an economic actor, that here it is acting for

18

reasons of foreign policy, and there's no doubt that

1

Congress has the control power, but why shouldn't the

20

assumption be that unless Congress says, States, you can

21

do this, that States can't once Congress has occupied the

22

field at least to the extent of having its own Burma law?

23

Why shouldn't the presumption be exactly the opposite,

24

that is, no State action unless Congress gives them

25

permission?

MR. BARNICO:

1

I think this case shows why that

2

presumption goes too far.

3

acknowledge the national interest in the control of

4

foreign policy that's at the heart of your question, this

5

case demonstrates why such a presumption would go too far.

That's because, although I

There has to be a sphere of State activity so

6

7

important to the States to speak, to act, to disassociate

8

their funds from this type of regime that the Framers
intended to be protected, so as you come to the question

10

of presumption, it seems to me a similar question to the

11

effect of the dormant foreign affairs powers.

12

there a sphere of State activity such as a resolution,

13

such as a selective purchasing law, so close to the

14

boycotts that the Framers knew so well, that ought to be

15

protected?

16

That is, is

The presumption would go too far, just as it

17

would operate in this case.

18

that Federal Government has acted as to Burma with Federal

1

sanctions, and that's the end of the story, and this

20

particular case also is a demonstration why the

21

presumption would be dangerous.

22

QUESTION:

It would simply be the fact

Mr. Barnico, you mentioned the

23

historical approach a few minutes ago.

Is there a

historical basis for -- say, prior to the 1 80's for

States taking this sort of position with respect to

foreign Governments?
MR. BARNICO:

2

You'd have to go back under our

3

research only to the revolutionary times.

4

there were no such actions.

QUESTION:

6

MR. BARNICO:

7

I think the eighties --

Until the 1980's?
The eighties is what we have in

mind.
QUESTION:

9

In the interim

Oh, but there were in the

revolutionary times, weren't there?

10

MR. BARNICO:

11

QUESTION:

That's right, and they included --

Virginia passed laws that prevented

12

the collection of British debts, and there was litigation

13

over that.

14

MR. BARNICO:

And -- but we have a different

15

approach, though, as to the boycotts in particular.

16

There's such a strong match here between the boycotts of

17

the revolutionary times and --

you mean before the Constitution was adopted?
MR. BARNICO:

Absolutely, Your Honor, and

terribly satisfactory basis for analyzing the thing after

1

Framers in adopting the foreign affairs clauses, Your

2

Honor, and the question would be, since the Framers

3

enumerated a number of prohibitions regarding treaties and

4

engaging in war and so forth, we'd have to ask ourselves

5

the question, do the affirmative grants of power to the

6

executive and legislative branches in the Constitution

7

have a nullifying force implied?

8

That is, to what extent does the grant to
Congress and the President nullify other State actions

10

that affect foreign affairs, and there we come to the

11

revolutionary times, because the Framers, who knew

12

boycotts well, who held them dear, did not enumerate them

13

as prohibited, and we say it would be highly unlikely to

14

deny to the States the rights that they knew were useful

15

and they knew were so bound up with questions of speech

16

and choice.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Barnico --

QUESTION:

If you're right, Mr. Barnico, why

1

were there -- have there been no Barnic -- no boycotts --

(Laughter.)

21

QUESTION:

22

23

-- between the time the Constitution

was adopted and the 1 80's?
MR. BARNICO:

Well, I think that has to do with

24

the fact that there was very limited global trade for

25

those years.

There was limited information available to

State governments about other activities in foreign

2

States.

3
4
5

This is a QUESTION:

How about the activities of Stalin in

Russia and Hitler in Germany and Mussolini in Italy?
MR. BARNICO:

Well, I don't know why, Your

6

Honor, but of course once -- in times of war the Federal

7

Government does act to establish a rule of uniformity.

8

Whether that has to do with neutrality or aiding a
resistance group, there's a new set of rules that would

10

kick in which aren't disturbed by our rules.

11

need not be concerned that actions of this type would be

12

aid of one side or another in a war, because there is a

13

specific prohibition in Article I, section 10, that the

14

States may not engage in war.

15

So, too, Congress often acts.

That is, you

The President

16

sometimes declares that countries are in a State of war,

17

and so neutrality is preserved through the action of the

18

Federal branch with authority to determine the national

1

rule of uniformity, but of course we argue here that

20

branch hasn't acted.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Barnico, may I go back to an

22

answer that you gave both to Justice Ginsburg and to the

23

Chief Justice a moment ago in which you emphasized the

24

expressive nature of the boycott activity which

25

Massachusetts is engaging in.

Why doesn't that suggest

1

that the proper way to draw the line is to allow States to

2

express themselves, to express their views solemnly any

3

way they want to, so long as they do not go beyond the

4

point of verbalizing?
Massachusetts or any State could pass, for

5
6

example, on this theory, resolutions condemning the regime

7

in Burma and, indeed, condemning those who do business

8

with it, but it would be left to the United States to go

9

beyond the expression of views and to regulate actual

10

relationships, including economic relationships.

11

that be a sensible way of having a theory behind our

12

preemption doctrine under the Foreign Commerce Clause?
MR. BARNICO:

13

Wouldn't

Well, of course we agree that we

14

ought to be able to speak in that way, but we don't think

15

the rule is sufficient for this reason.

16

leaves us open to the indirect support, through the use of

17

our money, the companies that are doing business in the

18

country.

19

QUESTION:

We think that it

Well, it does that, but that is a

20

judgment of the United States that it is not at least

21

inappropriate for that result to occur.

22

you would get to engage in expression.

your conscience, and any fault would lie, I suppose, at

the door of the national Government that was either

feature of at least the U.S.-Burma law is concern with the

desire to have multilateral action, and you know that

MR. BARNICO:

So for Massachusetts to go it on its

matters of foreign policy?
MR. BARNICO:

There's no clash in the preemption

are both unilateral and multilateral.

5

don't clash in that respect.

QUESTION:

The State sanctions

But this sanction was considered and

deliberately not done by Congress.
MR. BARNICO:

By Congress, in its choice as to

9

the Federal sanctions, but the 1996 Federal statute cannot

10

be looked at outside the context of the 1980's and the law

11

I referred to in 1993, that essentially what we're urging

12

here, Your Honor, is, it's unreasonable to conclude on

13

this question of conflict that we have been preempted in

14

light of the history that's gone before.

QUESTION:

May I ask this question --

The word you used previously was, you

didn't want to be associated with the regime that

worthwhile, obviously worthwhile objective, and I can

understand that, but the SG says in its brief -- you use

21

the word disassociated, all right.

boycotts.

Massachusetts is saying, we won't do business

2

with a Swedish firm that buys $15 worth of whatever from

3

the Burmese Government, and why doesn't the secondary

4

boycott just go too far, given Justice Ginsburg's

5

concerns, in respect to the need to disassociate yourself?
MR. BARNICO:

6

Well, we need to disassociate as a

7

practical matter because of the financial interconnections

8

among the companies, but beyond that, we need to

9

disassociate through the boycott of that type because the

10

question of boycott would entail action both against the

11

country that you hypothesized and people who do business

12

there.

13

Under the Court's precedent in Zschernig, in

14

other words, the secondary boycott as you describe it is

15

less indirect, so we think in the area of law in which

16

we're operating, to the extent that the Court is concerned

17

about effects on international affairs, a secondary

18

boycott is a reasonable means because it's indirect.

QUESTION:

Well, we're proceeding on the

MR. DYK:

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The first thing I think to make clear is that

8

the purpose of the Massachusetts law is that the district

9

court explicitly found, based on Massachusetts

10

concessions -- and that's reflected at page 81 of the

11

appendix to the petition -- was to condemn Burma and to

12

change the domestic policies of that nation, and the

13

mechanism that Massachusetts has chosen to accomplish

14

that, as Justice Breyer mentioned, is a coercive secondary

15

boycott, the kind of action which no private individual

16

would engage in, and that's undisputed in the record if

17

you look at pages 32 and 560 of the appendix in the court

18

of appeals.

19

Massachusetts has $2 billion in purchasing power

20

every year.

1

Justice Scalia, I think it was an

2

attribute of sovereignty and, indeed, if you go back and

look at the Articles of Confederation, you find that the

Articles of Confederation was much more explicit about the

things that States could not do in the area of foreign

policy.

If you look, if you compare the Articles of

Confederation with the Constitution, you find that the

articles were much more explicit.

14

we suggest, and it's reflected in the Federalist Papers

of specificity was not necessary, that the Constitution

was designed to give the foreign policy power to the

United States as a sovereign nation.

MR. DYK:

Well --- to affect foreign policy.
My answer to that, Justice O'Connor,

is, to the extent that those States and municipalities

used selective purchasing against South Africa, they were
unconstitutional and, of course, this Court never ruled on

that.
QUESTION:

Now, the Solicitor General takes a

different view, I gather, in the brief about that.

Now, what they had in connection with South

Africa was two kinds of laws, the selective purchasing

Without a treaty, Congress, if it passed a law, could pass

Commerce Clause, because I think that what -- the effect

2

of what Massachusetts has done here in many ways

3

exemplifies precisely what the Framers of the Constitution

4

were trying to accommodate and to accomplish and avoid in

5

enacting the Foreign Commerce Clause.

6

The problem that the Framers were addressing was

7

first and foremost the refusal by States in the Union

8

under the Articles of Confederation to honor debts that

9

they owed to British sympathizers and British citizens

10

notwithstanding the treaty of 1783, and what Massachusetts

11

has done here, and the purpose therefore in the clause,

12

was to keep other States and the Union from being held

13

accountable for decisions and unilateral actions for which

14

they didn't have the responsibility, and what

15

Massachusetts has done here is precisely the same.

16

The United States has had for a long time, at

17

least since 1990, a policy with respect to Burma -- and I

18

want to emphasize here that this is a case about means,

19

not goals with respect to the Burmese regime.

20

a policy that has emphasized in resolutions, in executive

21

orders, in the Federal Burma Act, and in the President's

22

1997 executive order, the importance of a coordinated,

23

multinational effort, because in the view of the national

24

Government it's the only way we can have an effective

25

voice with respect to Burma.

18

about it and we gave Congress the power to say, no, we

1

don't like that, you can't do that, and I have -- I think

20

that's incorrect for two reasons.

21

First of all, the Foreign Commerce Clause of its

22

own force preempts State laws surely --

and this Court

23

has decided it many times -- that discriminate on their

24

face against a particular country.

25

that was elucidated as -- by this Court as far back as

That was a principle

1

Cooley v. Board of Wardens, where the Court pointed out

2

that one of the main objects of the Constitution was,

3

quote, preventing discriminations favorable or adverse to

4

commerce with particular foreign nations that might be

5

created by State laws, and I know that there is

6

considerable uncertainty about the scope of the operation

7

of what has been called the dormant Foreign Commerce

8

Clause, but in essence the scope, the preemptive scope of
the Commerce Clause itself, absent positive legislation.
But there has never been a question from the

10
11

start that -- with respect to a law like this that singles

12

out and punishes and sanctions commerce with a particular

13

foreign country, that there is preemption by the Foreign

14

Commerce Clause of its own force.
Now, secondly, it would be a regime that would

15
16

be highly inimical both to the national Government and to

17

our States and the Federal system to require Congress or

18

the Federal executive to expressly keep track of and

preempt each one of these actions, and I'd like to just

20

explain --

QUESTION:

No, but the answer to that, it seemed

22

to me -- Mr. Dyk made the same point -- couldn't they pass

position you're asserting here today?

GENERAL WAXMAN:

7

QUESTION:

-- but they -- if I can just --

-- that the constitutional rule that

8

you advocate today could be enacted by Congress as a

9

statute.

10

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Yes.

In fact, I mean, our

11

position is that at least with respect to Burma, where

12

there is one voice, and the voice has spoken, and the

13

voice has spoken quite clearly with respect to means, it

14

is preempted in any event, either by operation of the

15

Foreign Commerce Clause or by the Federal action.

16

But if I can just go to the point, Justice

17

Scalia's point about what's so bad, what would be so bad

18

about requiring the national Government to act, I would

19

just say first of all, with respect to the national

20

Government's ability to regulate foreign commerce and

21

conduct foreign affairs, it is well-known that -- first,

22

that effective diplomacy often, probably usually requires

23

that things be done and not be done publicly, and

24

expressly, and the Austria example that I think Justice

25

Breyer gave is, I think we are being treated to a vision

1

2

of that point precisely.
Secondly, as this Court recognized in Curtiss-

3

Wright, and as the IEPA statute recognizes, fast action is

4

required by the time -- the problem may have festered and

5

come to a head by the time the national Government can go

6

through the processes necessary to preempt.

7

And I also would say with respect to Federalism

8

and the comity that our system requires, that it is a

9

wholly unnecessary irritant that would constantly come up

10

in the context of our political system if, in the area of

11

foreign affairs and foreign commerce, the national

12

Government in order to pursue its -- the objectives that

13

the Constitution gives it, were required to single out,

14

now, Massachusetts, we -- you know, we preempt what you

15

have done, and the Village of Takoma Park, we preempt what

16

you have done.

17

The question was raised earlier about the South

18

Africa sanctions which is, so far as we know, since the

19

beginning of the Republic, the only instance, and not only

20

the amicus brief citing the petitioner, but all of the

21

scholarly articles that are cited in those briefs, we

22

reviewed, and there are not instances of Governments

23

acting in their procurement capacity to do this.

24
25

But in the South Africa example, I think it's
important to recognize first that in 1986 -- the South

1

Africa case was decided by the Maryland Court of Appeals

2

in 1 8 , and I believe it's the only decided case -- that

3

the -- there was a congressional resolution, the national

4

Congress, explicitly allowing States to do this, and there

5

was a provision in the South Africa law that was passed

6

that granted an exemption to States engaging, and

7

localities engaging in procurement with Federal dollars

8

from the general Federal rule that required that the
lowest bidder, the lowest responsible bidder get it.

10

So I think the South Africa example, to the

11

extent that it consists of the only precedent that we

12

have, is highly distinguishable, because here, in addition

13

to the point I made about the frustration of the national

14

Government's objective to pursue a multilateral strategy,

15

the Massachusetts law is also inconsistent, and therefore

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A. BARNICO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BARNICO:

6

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

7

First, I would like to go to the question, or

8

the reason why foreign officials have visited Boston in
the last few years, and I must point out a Federal statute

10

not previously mentioned in the argument today, which is

11

the Federal law adopting the Uruguay Round agreements

12

under the GATT.
We, through the United States, has now been --

13
14

we have been purported to have been held to a new round of

15

international trade agreements.

16

that you've heard described are complaints under that

17

agreement.

1

the rest of the world will target their retaliation to

2

Massachusetts, and the rest of the United States will

3

remain unaffected?

4

Is that what you're suggesting?

MR. BARNICO:

I'm suggesting, Your Honor, that

5

as the -- if the focus is on the effects of our law, the

6

Court should not give great weight to the fact that

7

foreign countries have objected to the Massachusetts law

8

under a trade agreement that's been ratified by Congress.

9

We take that agreement to mean, and the

10

congressional action to mean, that Congress knows full

11

well that States will have complaints made against them of

12

this type.

13

QUESTION:

That's what I thought perhaps -- I

14

thought maybe you agree on this, I'm not sure, that

15

whatever it requires, we should treat the Foreign Commerce

16

Clause the same as the dormant Commerce Clause vis-a-vis

17

States and if, in fact, they could do this vis -- give us

18

a -- you'd have a regular body of law, we'd know how to

19

apply it, and what the -- what Massachusetts could do vis-

20

a-vis Texas, it can do vis-a-vis Austria, et cetera, at

21

least for purposes of this case.

22

MR. BARNICO:

Is that your view?

Yes, Your Honor, and that means --

23

that's why we urge the Court, under both of those

24

constitutional provisions, to recognize what we've

25

described as a market participation exception.

That's why

1

we've argued that the boycott, so close in nature to that

2

type of State activity, was not within the thought of the

3

Framers as to either of those dormant clauses.

4

That's the way to handle this, to preserve to

5

the States a limited sphere of activity which has speech

6

components and consumer components.

7

QUESTION:

Of course, what I'm thinking of is a

8

kind of nightmare, where all the right-to-work States pass

9

laws stopping procurement in the unionized States, and all

10

the unionized States pass laws trying to stop procurement

11

in the right-to-work States, and that's -- that kind of,

12

sort of chaos is what's worrying me under the dormant

13

Commerce Clause.

14

MR. BARNICO:

Well, those questions will remain

15

for Congress.

16

We can only hope, though, as I mentioned earlier, that

17

there is a comity owing between sister States that's not

18

owing to the Government of Burma, certainly, and

19

Massachusetts has the right in this instance to exercise

20

that proprietary power, that limited sphere of power

21

cabined as historical basis for assuming that the Framers

22

did not intend to take the boycotts out of the hands of

23

the States, just as we know the power of boycott remains

24

in the hands of every American citizen.

25

Under our rule they would be proprietary.

QUESTION:

Mr. Barnico, you said there's comity

among the States and there's not comity with Burma, but it

isn't Burma.

has been visited by an ASEAN delegation, by an EU

delegation, so it's the rest of the world of which we are

a part that may disagree strongly on the efficacy of

sanctions.

As you yourself recognized, Massachusetts

MR. BARNICO:

I acknowledge that, Your Honor,

and I point to the '94 law and the GATT simply to say that

this will be common in our view.

not of human rights dimension, but all kinds of laws will
