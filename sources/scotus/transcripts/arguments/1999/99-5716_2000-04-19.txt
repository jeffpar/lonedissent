ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD J. McCAULEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. McCAULEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Federal bank larceny is a lesser included

11

offense of Federal bank robbery.

12

language and history and understanding from centuries of

13

common law under which larceny has always been understood

14

to mean a lesser offense of robbery.

15

robbery was defined as an aggravated larceny or as a

16

compound larceny, all of the elements of the larceny

17

subsumed and embraced by the robbery.

18

was defined as an aggravated larceny because it had an

19

extra element.

20

QUESTION:

Both offenses draw their

At common law,

The robbery -- it

I don't think the Government contests

21

you on that point, Mr. McCauley.

I think that what they

22

rely on is a case like Bell against the United States,

23

which says that the bank robbery statute was -- was

24

deliberately altered so as not to be a common law and --

25

and its successor.

MR. McCAULEY:

1

I don't believe

the Prince

2

case reveals that there was not an altering of the common

3

law.

4

regarding the understanding of the 1948 recodification and

5

explains -- there are two things I think the Prince case

6

explained.

The Prince case I -- I think is the precedent here

7

It explained that the recodification in 1948 was

8

a change in phraseology, a tidying up of the entire

9

criminal code.

It was not a rewriting and redefining of

10

crimes.

And what's significant, it interpreted another

11

provision within 2113, the unlawful entry.

12

- and it emphasized right in its opinion -- it was

13

manifestly the purpose of Congress to establish lesser

14

offenses.

15

The Prince case said the heart of the offense is

16

the intent to steal.

17

emphasized.

18

provision.

19

the robbery provision.

20

have an intent to steal.

21
22

23

And it said -

It was -- that language was

The intent to steal on the unlawful entry
Then the unlawful entry provision merges into

QUESTION:

So, the robbery provision had to

What do you make -- how do you

distinguish or how do you treat the Bell case?
MR. McCAULEY:

The Bell case doesn't -- it's not

24

changing the common law understanding.

It's not

1

interpreting a statute that is codified a traditional

2

common law offense, we're going to understand all of the

3

elements at common law for that particular offense.

4

long history and tradition is not going to be eviscerated

5

or revolutionized if -- or -- I think the language in the

6

Morissette opinion -- if there was a mere deletion of a

7

term.

8

deletion of the term --

That

And that's what we have here in 1948, the mere

QUESTION:

9

Well, do -- do you agree that we

10

apply the so-called elements test to determine whether

11

it's a lesser included offense?
MR. McCAULEY:

12

13

Yes, Your Honor.

We do not

quibble with the Schmuck standard.

14

QUESTION:

Okay.

So, then we have to decide --

15

even if you're right about intent to steal, what about

16

the requirement in the larceny statute that property be

17

carried away, which doesn't appear in the bank robbery

18

statute?

19

problem?

And what do we do about the monetary value

MR. McCAULEY:

20

Well, if I may address the

21

monetary value problem first, Justice O'Connor.

There is

22

a monetary element in the robbery provision.

23

take the money or the property.

24

of value -- the universe of money, of which $1,000 is

25

embraced.

You must

The value is the universe

So, that is not an element.

And even if it is

The reason I say it's not an element is I refer

the Court to the Reviser's Notes and Congress in the

to $1,000, specifically stated that this change goes to

punishment.

However, should the Court interpret it as an

Well, what if the Court says it

doesn't go to punishment, it's an element?

Then what do

we do?
MR. McCAULEY:

Then it is -- then it is embraced

12

in the robbery provision's requirement of money -- a money

13

requirement.

14

QUESTION:

Why isn't the simple answer that the

15

-- that the -- whatever it is -- the -- the lesser degree

16

of -- of larceny is clearly included because there is no

17

particular value requirement there at all?

18

value is anything above 0, you're -- the lesser offense

19

value requirement is made, isn't it?

MR. McCAULEY:

That's all you have to do to -- to

in the greater offense embraced whether it's $1,000,

2

whether it's $100, whether it's above $100 --

3

QUESTION:

No, but let's -- I mean, in order for

4

you to prevail here, I think all we would have to conclude

5

was that there was some value requirement in the robbery

6

statute, as you pointed out, and that there was some value

7

requirement in at least one version of larceny.

8

the lesser grade of larceny, there's no requirement to

9

prove $1,000 or anything else.

And in

As long as there -- as

10

long as there is proof of something more than 0, the value

11

requirement is made.

And that's all you need, isn't it?

12

MR. McCAULEY:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Souter.

But then -- but then the -- the

14

greater larceny charge would not be a lesser included

15

offense and you would not have give the instruction if you

No, you do not.

Well, that's not going to help you

very much if -- if your client stole a yacht and the jury

is instructed, you need not -- you need not convict him of

instead he's guilty of larceny of property worth -- worth

There's no way that -- that the

The first adjustment is the amount

The definition of this -Well, what if the court were to think

it was an element not going -- not a sentencing factor,

QUESTION:

the carrying away problem.

MR. McCAULEY:

The carrying away is a common law

term signifying asportation.

17

it.

18

presented to the court, it could involve a movement

1

involving one foot, whether it be the foot or a hand.

20

common law understood it, and that's why robbery was

21

defined and understood as aggravated larceny.

22

asportation, the carry away, is in that take language of

23

the robbery statute.

presence of another, there is a slight movement.

MR. McCAULEY:

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

What about the third?

That is, as I

understand this, you have bank robbery, and that involves
taking money from a bank through force or violence.

10

MR. McCAULEY:

QUESTION:

Yes.

Then you have larceny, which involves

taking money from a bank.

That doesn't exist.

I forgot force and violence.

It looks identical but for the force

MR. McCAULEY:

say that -- that with intent to steal means there's

Now, what do you say about that?

MR. McCAULEY:

by the Court in Morissette, the conversion statute, 641 of

title 18 -- and Morissette previously had the term

feloniously.

And I think the wisdom of the Morissette opinion

-- and the wisdom of the Morissette opinion and its

application to this case is the language in Morissette

that the Court --

QUESTION:

Well, Morissette is totally different

from this case, it seems to me.

There there was no intent

requirement, and the Court said because at common law

there was one, we're going to read it in here.

12

have very specific elements that weren't present in

13

Morissette at all.

14

MR. McCAULEY:

Here you

I think there's a subtle

15

difference.

16

Morissette opinion substituted a knowing mens rea into a

17

statute because the common law understanding of the crime

18

of conversion did not have a specific intent element.

only had a general intent element.

opinion, I submit, stands for is the missing element.

2

Congress has not specifically contraindicated that as

3

departing from the centuries of understanding, the missing

4

element that the Court would imply in is what had appeared

5

at common law, meaning a general intent for the conversion

offense --

7

QUESTION:

If

That a criminal statute is going to

8

be -- if -- if it's silent as to intent, there's going to

be some mens rea requirement.

10

MR. McCAULEY:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

But I think that's quite different

12

from the situation here where the elements have been quite

13

-- quite specifically specified and one -- one

14

substantially differs from the other.

QUESTION:

MR. McCAULEY:

Is -- is --- whereas robbery is specific

intent to steal.

Always it's been understood that in the

21

mere deletion of the felonious word, consistent with

22

Morissette, you're going to imply in the mirror image, the

23

specific intent to steal.

24

the best fit with the Court's prior holdings in Prince and

Heflin.

And that best fits.

QUESTION:

1

May I just go back to -- I want to

2

make sure that I understood your -- understand your

3

argument.

4

If I'm wrong, tell me I'm -- tell me where I go wrong.

5

I -- and this is what I think your argument is.

I -- I think you were saying in so many words

6

that feloniously, under the statute prior to the revision,

7

had two functions.

8

felony and will be punished as such.

One function was to say this is a
Second function is

to say you must prove intent to steal because that's what
10

feloniously implied at common law.
They dropped the word feloniously when they

11
12

adopted what is now, I guess, section 1, which explains

13

what crimes are felonies and what crimes are misdemeanors.

14

So, they didn't need feloniously for the first purpose

15

anymore.

16

But your argument is that when they dropped it

17

as redundant for the purpose of identifying the crime as a

18

felony, they didn't mean to redefine the elements of the

1

crime to omit intent to steal.

Have I got it right?

I suppose that if I went into a bank and I took some money

an intent to steal.

It's a little hard and it's rather absurd.

I was wrong.

It wasn't mine.

But

It was

the bank's, and so I wouldn't be guilty of larceny.

Very well, Mr. McCauley.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

13

Bank larceny, felony bank larceny, is a lesser

14

included offense of bank robbery because it requires proof

15

of three elements not found in the robbery provision:

16

intent to steal or purloin, the carrying away of the

17

property, and that the property is worth more than $1,000.

prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and it is reasonable to

11

infer that Congress, in enacting the bank robbery

provision, would not want to subject the Government to

proof where the robber had engaged in such unambiguously

dangerous activity as using force or putting somebody in

fear or intimidation to take property.

MR. FREDERICK:

1

The words that Congress actually-

2

used in not having an intent to steal requirement were

3

consistent with the modern trend of legislatures,

4

including Congress, to make robbery a general intent crime

5

because robbery is a crime against the person, and the

6

social evil that legislatures are legislating against is

7

the knowing use of force to take property from a person.

8

It's not the interest of many State legislatures to be

9

concerned with what the robber's ultimate intent with

10

respect to the property is.

11

he employs to take the property and that is what Congress

12

was legislating against.

MR. FREDERICK:

No, Justice Ginsburg.

Just the

text of the statute as it currently exists.
And I would just point out that there is nothing

7

illogical about making that decision because of the

8

emphasis of the robber on using force.

That is a social

evil Congress is perfectly justified in legislating
10

against irrespective of what the robber intends to do with

11

the property.

12

because otherwise innocent conduct would be subject to the

13

criminal sanction.

14

property and robbery is a crime against the person.

15

because of these distinctive evils, it is perfectly

16

logical to think that Congress would have gone in the same

17

way that States have gone in changing robbery from a

18

specific intent crime to a general intent crime.

that the petitioner here asks for was felony bank larceny,

so even if the Court were to disagree with our submissions

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. McCAULEY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I just have some brief points.
I do not believe the common law understandings

of these two offenses is as malleable as my adversary

says, and I -- both sides have addressed all the

citations.

I would also draw the Court's attention to a

The structure of 2113 supports a

property provision, which makes it a crime to receive

stolen property and then points to 2113(b) as to how you

If you look to 2113 (c), the receiving stolen

10

punish that receiver of stolen property and you punish him

11

equally the same as you would punish a larcenist.
And we point out the anomaly of that at page 8

12

13

of our reply brief, that that would allow a receiver of

14

stolen property from a bank robber to go unpunished if

15

only the receiver of a stolen property can be punished as

robbery is bad, so we're going to make it easier to prove.

That cannot trump the congressional text here.

And I submit that the

10

mirror of the offense that's being interpreted, just as it

11

was in Morissette, the offense of conversion that required

12

a knowing element that was read in as a mens rea -- it's

13

always been the requisite element of intent to steal at

14

robbery.

And that's what it was from 1934 to 1948.

15

And I think to square with the Prince holding,

16

that the heart and the gravamen of the offense -- and the

17

Prince court said that the gravamen of the offense of
