ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE WATERS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. WATERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents the question of whether the

2

State of California can force political parties to choose

3

their nominees for public office through a blanket primary

4

system which is expressly designed to produce more

5

moderate nominees than those that are favored by the

6

parties themselves.

7

Under California law, the only means by which a

8

party can nominate his candidates for the ballot is

9

through the blanket primary system.

The blanket primary

20

makes the issue of party affiliation and ideology

21

irrelevant.

22

to vote in several different party primaries at the very

23

same election.

24

political parties' First Amendment right to choose the

25

standard-bearer who best represents the party's ideology.

It allows any voter to cross party lines and

It is a wholesale assault on the party --

This case is a direct descendent of this Court's

1

2

decision in Tashjian, which held that Connecticut could

3

not enforce a closed primary law on a party that sought to

4

open its primary to Independent voters.
QUESTION:

5
6

blanket primary system imposed here?
MR. WATERS:

7
8

Now, open primaries differ from the

Honor.

They differ significantly, Your

In California -- to begin with the open primary,

the generic open primary exists in a State where there is
10

no party registration.

11

if they're registered they go into the polling place, and

12

in a class open primary State I believe that they are

13

given the ballots of any political party and they make a

14

choice of which party that they vote in.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. WATERS:

17
18

Voters come to the polling place,

Well -But they vote within a party, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

-- if we agreed with you here on the

1

blanket primary thing, wouldn't we be casting some doubt

20

on the open primary system as well?

21

MR. WATERS:

I don't think so, Your Honor, and I

22

think that there are quantitative and qualitative decision

23

differences here between an open primary and a blanket

24

primary, and if I could go into that, I think the

25

qualitative difference is that suggested by Justice Powell

in his dissent in the LaFollette case, which involved

2

another issue, but in which Justice Powell discussed at

3

some length the issue of the validity or the

4

constitutionality of open and closed primaries.

5

And Justice Powell's position there was that

6

what the First Amendment guarantees to the parties is the

7

right to have -- to limit their nominating process to

8

voters who affiliate with the party.

presented in that case, which dealt with Wisconsin, an

He said the question

10

open primary State, was whether there was an act of

11

affiliation.

12

Wisconsin voter chooses the ballot of a Democratic or

13

Republican Party, that in itself is an act of affiliation

14

because that voter is choosing to limit him -- hisself or

15

herself to the nominees of one party.

16

What Justice Powell said is, when a

QUESTION:

But isn't that just a matter of

17

degree, because -- simply because the decision can be made

18

on the spur of the moment when the voter gets to the

19

polls?

20

primary State that the voter does not have in the blanket

21

primary State is the kind of mix-and-match right.

22

The only right that the voter has in the open

If the voter who has traditionally been either

23

not registered, or registered as a Republican, takes a

24

Democratic ballot in the open primary State, there's no

25

more affiliation between that voter and the party than

there is the voter who under the blanket system chooses to

2

vote for -- in the Democratic primary for Governor and the

3

Republican primary for State Treasurer.

5

MR. WATERS:

Well, I disagree with that, Your

Honor.

6

QUESTION:

Why?

7

MR. WATERS:

I think that the history of the

8

American regulation of political parties is distinct, and

9

what we have is a history where the Government in

10

virtually every State has operated to try and make it easy

11

for people to affiliate with a party, but in States that

12

have party systems, and California has a party system,

13

Proposition 198 itself, when you register to vote, it's in

14

Proposition 198 you actually state that you affiliate with

15

a political party.

The fact that --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. WATERS:

Isn't that a pretty empty formality?
I think it is not.

I think it is

18

not.

I think the Constitution means something, and I

19

think that the Constitution means that a party has a right

20

to limit its nominating process to people who affiliate

21

with it in some sense.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. WATERS:

24
25

Okay.

Let's take the --

I would prefer to have a higher

hurdle.
QUESTION:

Let's take the example of the party

1

that says, we want our affiliates to be real affiliates,

2

and therefore we want them to have registered as such at

3

least 6 months before the primary, or 2 months before the

4

primary, leaving aside the question of late voter

5

registration for reasons of transience.

6

And in a case in a State in which the State law

7

is, well, you can't require a 30-day affiliation, you

8

can't require anything more than the instantaneous

9

affiliation, isn't the sense of affiliation just as

10

ephemeral there as is the sense of affiliation between in

11

a blanket primary State the fellow who walks in and says,

12

I guess I'll vote for a Democrat for Governor and a

13

Republican in the Treasurer's race?

14

MR. WATERS:

15

disagree with that, Your Honor.

16

difference between affiliating -- first of all, I think

17

one has to assume that in the American system that most

18

voters operate in good faith, that when they are making --

19

when they choose a party ballot, that they are choosing

20

that for a reason, that the Republican ballot means

21

something to them, a Democratic or a Libertarian ballot

22

means something to them.

23

QUESTION:

Well, no.

I mean -- I just
I think that there is a

Well, you may be right on that, in

24

which case I take it your argument is, look, we're going

25

to operate on the premise that an affiliation, even a

last-minute one, is at least a bona fide affiliation and

good enough.

MR. WATERS:

QUESTION:

I think we have to do that.
And that's different from no

MR. WATERS:

I think we have to do that to

distinguish a blanket primary from the open primary.

I believe the constitutional issue

which we're bringing to you today would not exist there,

commandeering the parties as a vehicle for -- to blend the

22

political ideologies together.

23

California indeed has a nonpartisan nominating

24

system for the vast majority of races, those that are not

for Congress, Senate, the Assembly, and State-wide, and

1

there is, indeed, one State-wide office, the

2

Superintendent of Public Construction, that is elected

3

through a nonpartisan primary.

4

QUESTION:

Does any State other than, we're

5

told, Louisiana, have such a nonpartisan system for State­

6

wide offices?

7
8

MR. WATERS:

Not that I know of.

I believe the

answer to that is no, although I will say that the
evidence at trial did not explore that perhaps in great

10

depth.

I mean, as petitioners -- as plaintiffs we did not

11

go into great depth in other States.

12

Louisiana, because Your Honor just brought it up, which I

13

think is distinctive, I think Louisiana is a blend.

14

presents yet another issue here, in that it is a

15

nonpartisan primary there in the sense that only two --

the two highest vote-getters go on to the general

election.

I think that Louisiana might present a different

21

issue, and that is the use of a party label in their race,

22

but not the issue that is presented here.

QUESTION:

Are you -- is it a consequence of

24

your answer to Justice Ginsburg that a State really can do

25

by way of ballot access, if it's clever enough, what it

cannot do by way of a blanket primary scheme?
MR. WATERS:

I don't understand the question,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Let's assume that in a ballot

5

access -- that it had a ballot access law saying, we will

6

let the top four vote-getters in the primary, without

7

reference to party affiliation we'll let the top four

8

vote-getters in the primary be on the ballot in the

9

general election.

10

I take it your answer to Justice

Ginsburg is that a State may do that.

11

MR. WATERS:

12

QUESTION:

It is indeed, sir.
Okay.

Wouldn't the result in

13

practice come out in effect to a series of choices which

14

are more or less the equivalent of what the voters can do

15

under the blanket primary scheme?

16

MR. WATERS:

I think the result may or may not

17

be similar to that.

18

describing the difference -- if California were to go

19

toward a nonpartisan primary system there would be at

20

first a significant difference.

21

I think that in the situation you're

First of all it's very -- it's not -- there

22

would have to be some relatively easy means for people to

23

get on the primary ballot, which is indeed the case now

for California nonpartisan -- or -- yes, for California

25

nonpartisan races.

I mean, it's very hard for an Independent

candidate in California to get on the general election

The whole system is designed to force people into

If they went nonpartisan, I assume that it would

be -- a result of that would also, there would have to be

7

relatively easy access to getting on the primary ballot,

8

and at that point I think each party would have the

9

access -- I think there might be access questions, but

10

they'd have to have a way to get on there somehow.

11

Candidates have to get on the primary ballot.
What happens after that might present a whole

12

13

range of issues, but the point is that those people,

14

California would not in a sense be renting the parties, to

use their names to promote false candidates.

17

I mean, that

So you -- it boils down to two

18

things.

19

I am a Democrat, when there has been no act of affiliation

20

and, number 2, we will assume that acts of affiliation are

21

basically acts in good faith.

22

The State cannot in effect allow a person to say,

MR. WATERS:

Yes, and on the first one it's not

23

just that there's been no act of affiliation, that indeed,

24

under Proposition 198 itself, when people register to vote

25

they are invited to make an affiliation with another

party.
It's just not no act of affiliation, but as the

2

3

evidence in this case suggested, where Mervyn Field, the

4

leading pollster in California testified before trial that

5

his polls at that point suggested 30 percent of registered

6

Republicans would cross over.

It's just that -- it's not

7

just the lack of affiliation.

These are actually voters

8

who have signed the registration in another party.
QUESTION:

9

Mr. Waters, maybe I misunderstood the

10

that we want to open our primary to are affiliating with

We just want to appeal to them and extend our

I thought that was the argument that was

MR. WATERS:

Well, that's exactly right, Justice

9

Ginsburg, and I think that's what makes Tashjian a much

20

more difficult case from my side of the aisle than this

21

case.

22

that it was indeed a case where the Republican Party

23

wanted to open up and invite Independents to join in.

position to be, the party can make its own decision about

1

what affiliation is sufficient, or whether it requires an

2

affiliation, and the party in Tashjian made one decision.

3

The parties here want to make a different one and, under

4

the First Amendment, they have that choice.

5

MR. WATERS:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. WATERS:

That's correct.

Tashjian --

Do I misunderstand you?
Tashjian -- Tashjian is a

8

slightly -- I think there's two theories here.

Tashjian,

9

if I could just speak colloquially, I think represents to

10

people who practice in this field as a party sovereignty

11

case.

12

that Tashjian stands for the proposition that parties have

3

It essentially -- what it's distilled down to is

at least some rights to structure their own rules.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. WATERS:

Well, do you agree with that?
I do, indeed.

I do, indeed, but

6

what I'm saying -- I agree.

Tashjian, and I think that what we're dealing with here is

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. WATERS:

I mean --- and then this Court would have

3

to, or a court would have to go through the weighing

4

process, but I mean, my point with Tashjian is, I think

5

that the -- one -- the first element I think that under

6

this Court's test that you have to measure is, is there a

7

severe burden on the party's associational rights?
Whatever one can say about Tashjian, I think

8

9

here, where every California voter, 15 million of them are

10

invited to vote in every party's primary in each race with

11

absolutely no right of affiliation, that is a very

12

significant and, in fact, severe infringement on party

13

rights.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Waters, are you -- suppose the

15

Court were to agree with your position, are you seeking

16

any kind of retroactive relief here?

17

recent elections were conducted under this scheme that

18

you're challenging.

MR. WATERS:

Presumably the

We're -- the answer's no, we're not

actually we don't know how many, that the blanket primary

has changed the results of elections, but --

QUESTION:

4

MR. WATERS:

Did --- this case itself will have no

Did you make any argument that this

is so confusing that it's detrimental to the party?

me ask you this:

MR. WATERS:

10

Let

I think the argument we made is

11

just -- one of the arguments we made was the dilution of

12

the ballot label, which might slough over to that, but I

13

have to admit, Justice Kennedy, is that it did not dawn on

14

me when I did the trial that there would be 23 names on

MR. WATERS:

It's randomized. Under California

21

There's a randomization --

Any conceivable pattern is

QUESTION:

But you haven't argued that this

confusion dilutes the party effectiveness?

5

MR. WATERS:

Well, I would focus on the dilution

6

more than the confusion, but I think that obviously one

7

deliberate aspect of Proposition 198 was to invite people

8

to cross over in each race and vote in other parties'

9

primaries.

The record here is -QUESTION:

that, but I don't think that conforms with the

I mean,

despite -- even though the endorsement process could go on

there, the candidate, the winner of that race would not be

chosen by members of the Libertarian Party, and the

discuss here, because they are a very small party.

Before this case, I would have made

the same assumption, Justice Stevens, and what the record

shows is that there was an expert report provided by

Richard Winger who, on the basis of historical voting

patterns in California, he -- at trial he testified that

he believed in minor party primaries that the number of

voters from outside the party would out-number the number

of voters from inside the party.

Now, there are two lodgings before this Court

2

two-and-a-half times the number of registered Libertarians

in those districts.

Now, I don't know how many of the Libertarians

actually voted, but my point is that the ratio is actually

two-and-a-half to one, at the very least two and a half --

7

the two-and-a-half being people who are not registered

MR. WATERS:

I think -- none of them were

particularly well-known, Your Honor, but I think the fact

18

of the matter -- what the Libertarians testified about at

where there are eight males, some percentage of the

electorate will vote for the female.

MR. GEDE:

But the statute, it seems to me, is

inseparable from a regime in which the popular choice of

Well, why not?

I mean, what about

the party that does not want to be representative?

It

thinks the country's going in the wrong direction.

It

knows the majority wants to go that way, but it wants to

send out a message, a clarion call to call the country

I don't mind majoritarian rule at the

Well, this is the precise time when

the party ought to be able to make its own selection for

7

the spokesperson to run in the general election, to

8

articulate the stand and the views that the party wants

9

the voters to have a chance to hear.

10

That's precisely the point at which the

11

associational interest of the party is at its zenith, and

12

for the State to come in and say no, you have to be more

Justice Kennedy suggested, call for and endorse before the

Justice Scalia, was that it was contributing to excessive

partisanship, and partisan strife, and that has

contributed to alienation and has -- and it has resulted

in 30 years of decreased participation in voter turn-out.

the State could tell a party, without affecting its

Couldn't the party that wants to

purpose?

MR. GEDE:

Is there any reason why the

I don't have an answer beyond that.
Were the Framers aware of initiative

No, of course, not, to my knowledge.

I don't know that they were -QUESTION:

They weren't aware of political

parties, either, I don't suppose.
