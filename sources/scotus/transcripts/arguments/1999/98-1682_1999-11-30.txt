ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. FELDMAN:

10

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case concerns Congress' attempt to address

12

the problem of graphic sexually explicit adult programming

13

that is available on cable televisions -- on cable

14

television to minors with merely the flip of a dial.

15

available to children even though their parents have not

16

subscribed to the cable channels carrying the programming

17

and therefore have every reason to believe that they're

18

not receiving that programming on their televisions.

1

It's

The phenomenon is known as signal bleed, and it

20

occurs when a cable operator scrambles partially the video

21

portion of a premium channel like that operated by

22

appellee, but -- and -- but meanwhile the soundtrack from

23

that channel and other portions of the video programming

24

are allowed to get through, even to non-subscribers.

25

As a result, children with access to cable

1

television gain access intentionally or accidentally to

2

what the district court termed the virtually 100 percent

3

sexually explicit programming.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Feldman, is there evidence in the

5

record of actual signal bleed as opposed to the potential

6

for it?

I mean, what -- what does the record show?

7

MR. FELDMAN:

There's very substantial evidence

8

of that.

In the first place -- and I think the easiest

9

way to approach that is the district court found that on

10

most cable television systems -- and there's some

11

variation, to be sure, but on most cable television

12

systems, the audio portion of programming on channels like

13

those that Playboy or Spice or Spice Hot operates -- the

14

audio portion goes through unhindered.

15

there and that's a finding of the district court.

16

QUESTION:

So, that -- that's

While I have you interrupted, what

17

level of scrutiny do you think our precedents dictate --

18

govern our analysis here in light of the fact that we've

19

said that cable television and the Internet are entitled

20

to strict scrutiny?
MR. FELDMAN:

21

The Court has never said that with

22

respect to the question of indecency on cable television,

23

and in fact, the Court has specifically declined to decide

24

that question in the past on a number -- several

25

occasions.

In our view, the right answer, for the reasons

1
2

given in our brief, is not quite strict scrutiny; that is,

3

there should be a showing of a compelling interest because

4

it is a content-based regulation.

5

But some deference should be given in light of

6

the factors that the Court has noted in Pacifica and later

7

cases, the pervasiveness into the -- in the home, the harm

8

to children.

9

choice among alternatives of -- of how to deal with the

Some deference should be given to Congress'

10

problem.

And especially that's true where what the -- the

11

alternative that Congress has chosen is time-channeling as

12

one option, which permits the cable operator to show the

13

-- show the material from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.

14

unhindered and with no restrictions.

15

that's the solution that the Court approved in Pacifica,

16

and it's a reasonable accommodation of the competing

17

interests.

18

That is the --

It keeps -QUESTION:

Mr. Feldman, do -- do I have to -- do

19

I have to assume, for purposes of this case, that what is

20

at issue here is just what you call indecency and not

21

obscenity?

I mean, I've read some of the footnotes in --

22

in your brief that describe -- describe these matters.

23

My law clerks have looked at the videos that were lodged,

24

and I wouldn't even read the descriptions in -- in public.

25

It seems to me obscenity.

MR. FELDMAN:

1
2

I think that for purposes of this

case you have to assume that it's indecency.

3

QUESTION:

Why do I have to assume that?

4

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, because -- I suppose because

5

that's -- that's what -- insofar as -- insofar as there's

6

obscenity that's being broadcast on cable television, it's

7

already independently unlawful under the statute.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, you -- you can have -- you can

have more than one means of -- of preventing that evil, it

10

seems to me.

11

below that this was not obscenity, is there?

12

there were, I just can't -- can't imagine that what you

13

describe in your brief doesn't qualify as obscenity.

14
15

There's no factual finding of the court

QUESTION:

And even if

The Government didn't charge that it

was obscene.

16

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes.

I mean, it wasn't really a

17

-- it wasn't a subject of proof at trial.

18

that the obscenity issue turns on contemporary community

19

standards in different communities across the country.

20

also -- and a number of other factors as well.

your brief you urge particularly that we look at exhibits

2

1, 2, and 44.

MR. FELDMAN:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

Um-hmm.

Are those typical or are those the

worst cases?
MR. FELDMAN:

Those are -- I can't -- I can't

7

answer that question because I can't say which they are.

8

They are examples of what happens when signal bleed

9

occurs, and this goes back to Justice O'Connor's question

10
11
12

13

a little bit.
QUESTION:

Yes, but for example, one of them, 2,

is not as graphic as 1.
MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

It definitely varies.

It

14

varies from time to time and from place to place.

15

times when those tapes were made, there's no reason not to

16

think that the exact same material is being pumped down to

17

all of the other subscribers on those particular cable

18

television --

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

At the

I -- I can imagine a cable

20

channel advertising itself as we -- you know, we transmit

21

indecent programming.

22

viewers I suppose as opposed to, quote, sexually explicit

23

programming.

That's going to get a lot of

I had thought that the answer to my question you

25

were going to give was that this is a facial challenge and

1

that even if these particular productions are obscene and

2

if this whole channel can be characterized as obscene, you

3

-- you have to consider the application of this statute to

4

other channels that -- that qualify as, quote,

5

explicit channels that are not obscene.
MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I would -- I would agree with

that.

QUESTION:

That -- that would be a good answer

if there existed any such channels.

Are you sure that

10

there exist any such channels?

11

we have to imagine factual situations that we know do not

12

exist out in the real world?

13

MR. FELDMAN:

Well,

In a facial challenge, do

I -- I guess the -- the -- I

14

don't think there's a record made as to whether there are

15

other channels that broadcast materials that -- that

16

wouldn't be obscene under -- well, let me put it this way.

QUESTION:

its terms?

19

this -- this law?

22

What does the statute cover in -- in

What -- what channels are -- are subject to

MR. FELDMAN:

I think it's channels primarily

devoted to sexually explicit programming.
QUESTION:

Right.

Now, do you think there are

23

out there in the real world channels primarily devoted to

sexually explicit program that do not -- do not contain

25

obscene transmission in large part?

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I don't know based on this

record whether there are or not.

But I do think that it

7

know what the answer is.

But I do know that based -- that

based on the record that -- the question of whether

9

something is obscene, as I said before, depends on the

local -- on contemporary community standards of specific

communities.

about it.

15

MR. FELDMAN:

16

QUESTION:

I beg your pardon?

Maybe it should have been.

Maybe we

17

cannot answer the -- the facial challenge question without

18

inquiries into those questions, including inquiries into

19

-- into whether there are any, quote, sexually explicit

20

channels that do not regularly contain material that is

21

obscene by anybody's community standards.

22

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I think it's exceptionally

23

difficult to litigate an issue such as whether material is

24

obscene that's broadcast on a nationwide channel because

there are standards that differ from State to State and

QUESTION:

3

Mr. Feldman, wouldn't that be the --

wouldn't that be the prosecutor's choice?

I mean, a

4

court -- could a court say, if the Government chooses not

5

to characterize something as obscene, I don't care what

6

the prosecutor or the Government's attorney chooses to

7

bring to this court, I'm going to make the case and insist

8

that the Government makes the case that it's obscene?

9

- I didn't know that a court had that authority.

10

MR. FELDMAN:

11

QUESTION:

No.

I -

I don't think it does.

May I ask this, Mr. Feldman?

If

12

Justice Scalia is right, that all this stuff is obscene,

13

you didn't really need the statute, did you?
MR. FELDMAN:

MR. FELDMAN:

It's just

superfluous.

If it were all obscene, then --

The statute wouldn't -- wouldn't

Can you tell me -But I -- I do think that -- well,

I'd just go back to what I said -QUESTION:

that's how you would protect the little children.

And that's --

1

MR. FELDMAN:

2

historically what has been done.

3

there were -- and this goes back to the exhibits that

4

Justice Ginsburg was talking about, is that -- that this

5

material was coming down the line on cable channels to

6

parents into homes who had specifically chosen not to

7

subscribe to it and only found out after their children

8

had viewed it that they were seeing it.

9

portions of the programming, as I mentioned, are exactly

10

the same kinds of audio material that was at issue in --

11

in Pacifica, which only involved the radio, and in Sable

12

-- in Sable -- the Sable case, which involved the dial-a-

13

porn regulation of telephone lines.

Mr. Feldman, I -- I'm sure everybody

would agree that this happens in some instances.

extent to which it is happening, i.e., the extent to which

in non-subscriber homes the bleed is being observed by the

That was

And if you --

10

the number of parents who actually subscribed to this is

rather low.

show there there's a substantial problem.

know whether what you're talking about is the availability

of it in 1 -- or 10 homes or the number of children that

3

are actually watching -QUESTION:

4

I think it's fairly much of an

5

academic point based on your figures, but I just wanted to

6

know what the -- what the standard was to the extent of

7

the evil.
MR. FELDMAN:

8

9

I think that the -- the only --

well, the reason I can't answer that is I think the

10

question and the question on which the district court

11

decided -- well, the key question here is to compare the

12

extent to which there's a burden of speech that's imposed

13

by section 505 with the evil that it's addressing.

14

so, you have to look at kind of both sides of the

15

equation.

16

I've addressed -- talked about so far, and that includes

17

the audio signal bleed that is very widespread at least

18

and video signal bleed that varies from time to time and

19

place to place but that was the cause of a lot of

20

complaints and clearly does happen, as shown by the

21

tapes --

And

The evil that -- that it's addressing is what

QUESTION:

Well, certainly in our kiddie

require any very comprehensive showing of how many

children were engaged in it.

1

MR. FELDMAN:

That's correct, and if you look at

2

the Pacifica case, there was one complaint by -- from one

3

parent that triggered the Pacifica litigation, and there

4

was no showing in that record that there was more than one

5

child who listened to it.

6

It's the -- the problem here is the risk that -

7

- is that the availability of this material in people's

8

homes who have not subscribed to it and don't even think

9

that they're getting it.

10

QUESTION:

What Congress did to --

What material?

I mean, all we know,

11

if you're going to defend this statute facially without -

12

- without making a determination that all of these

13

channels, as far as we know, are -- are carrying

14

obscenity, they can just be dirty words.

15

just be, you know, blue language.

they could be -QUESTION:

You -- you want us to decide this

20

channels that use some -- some naughty words that

21

shouldn't be used, indecency and not -- not obscenity.

22

MR. FELDMAN:

No.

I -- I don't think so.

I

23

think that the -- what was -- the facts that were

24

underlying Congress' action are the facts that were found

25

by the district court, and they are that there are

1

channels that broadcast virtually 100 percent sexually

2

explicit content and that that content is continuously

3

broadcast.
QUESTION:

4

That's not what Congress addressed in

5

-- in using the word indecency, which is -- which is

6

defined very broadly.
MR. FELDMAN:

7
8

It covers many other things.
Right, that's true.

But -- that's

true.
QUESTION:

9

For purposes of the facial challenge,

10

we have to assume the existence of -- of a person who uses

11

the most innocuous of -- of those programmings.
MR. FELDMAN:

12

I don't -- I -- I don't -- I don't

13

think that that's correct.

I think that you can look at

14

the -- at the -- I don't think appellee would have

15

standing to challenge the statute based on someone else

16

who used the most innocuous of the material that would

17

fall within this.

18

But in any event, this is the same material --

QUESTION:

I thought that's -- I thought that's

what a facial challenge was, that if -- if you could show

is indecent.

2

Am I right?

I thought this case involved one not two.

MR. FELDMAN:

3

It involves -- well, the FCC took

4

that -- that definition and said that one is a subset of

5

two, and it defined them both in the same way that -- the

6

same definition that it has used in the regulation of

7

dial-a-porn on -- on telephone lines which has been upheld

8

now in the lower court.
QUESTION:

9

MR. FELDMAN:

10

QUESTION:
12

It may be a subset.
It's a subset.

Is it still that we're dealing with

one?
MR. FELDMAN:

3

I -- I don't think that there's

4

any determination of which we're dealing with.

5

dealing with material that is -- that is indecent as

6

defined by the FCC with a definition that is used and has

7

been used for the past 20 years to control indecency on

Congress decided is not that children can't get this.

4

What Congress decided is that it's harmful to children and

5

they shouldn't get it unless their parents consent.

6

it's not uncommon in our society that children don't get

7

things unless their parents consent, and ordinarily that

8

requires affirmative consent by the parent, not really the

9

parent's failure to act.
QUESTION:

MR. FELDMAN:

Am I right that in fact the

That's correct.

But it was

10

amendment to the same bill that contained section 504, and

11

what we do know about it, it was specifically addressed to

12

the fact that there was this 504 alternative out there,

13

and Senator Feinstein specifically said, we should put the

14

burden not on the parent, having already not subscribed to

15

these channels to now say again, I don't want them, but to

16

put it on the cable company to say, if you want to

17

transmit these -- this material, people should

18

affirmatively request it.

19

You know, I'd add that under the district

20

court's findings, it would take a -- an extremely small

21

number of parents to request blocking to make the whole

22

scheme uneconomical, something like 1 or 2 percent.

we have disagreed from the beginning that it's necessarily

the nature of the indecency standard and how it applies to

that it's impossible to distinguish what might be

This Court's decision in the Denver Area case is

quite pertinent to this case because it recognized a

Mr. Corn-Revere, on page 42a of the

appendix where the court is giving its opinion in this

is essentially 100 percent sexually oriented in contrast

to the other entertainment channels that display only

only that which is indecent or that which is sexually

the non-safe harbor hours that once again the Government

9

has not been able to define for us.

The difficulty is the statute

As a matter of fact, the Government's definition

10

11

of the case, as a facial matter of the indecency standard

12

and has litigated in this case, is that there is no

13

distinction between hard-core pornography, as Justice

14

Scalia was mentioning earlier, and safe sex information if

15

it's presented on Playboy Television.

16

the overbreadth and the restrictiveness of section 505 is

exacerbated.

MR. CORN-REVERE:

I think when it comes to

making a decision that's going to restrict a significant

amount of speech that is protected by the Constitution,

11

that something more would be required than simply an

12

assumption.

13

And in fact, this is the very argument that the

14

Government presented in the Denver Area case involving

15

indecency on leased access channels, in fact, in almost

16

the same language that they've presented here.

17

look at pages 36 to 37 of the Government's brief to this

QUESTION:

Can it do that -I think it would require --

-- without violating the First

MR. CORN-REVERE:

I -- I think that would

8

require an analysis of whether or not less restrictive

measures than a ban would also touch on that problem.

And

10

that also is the distinction that we've drawn between this

11

Court's holding in Pacifica which applied to broadcasting

12

and this case where there are less restrictive measures.

13

And with respect to the possibility that some

14

parents may not be fully attentive, as Justice Kennedy's

15

Area speaks to that issue.

17

QUESTION:

What do you say to the argument

18

that's made here that on the assumption that there are

Now, of course, your -- your argument

in -- in your brief to the effect that it would not be

MR. CORN-REVERE:

The inference that the

proof issue, and that's how the district court viewed it

22

when they suggested that if there is a low rate of lockbox

It's also important to note that section 505 is

3

for dealing with the phenomenon of signal bleed in those

the market has provided a number of mechanisms to allow

The basic difference between the

It's

because Denver was taking a lot of programs on a lot of

different channels and forcing them to segregate.

13

we're dealing with material that is segregated.

Unlike the world where I grew up, I think many,

many thousands of children come home after school and

20

there's no one there and parents don't want to say I'll

call up the program and do something because that means

they lose an afternoon at work while -- while they're home

That's --

they're not so activist as me.

me to be the pressure for saying it makes a big difference

MR. CORN-REVERE:

Notwithstanding those

practical difficulties, every one of the examples that the

Government was able to provide -- and it really was only a

QUESTION:

Well, when you say the assumption

that there would have to be a service call, was the

district court making a finding that there would have to

be a service call?

MR. CORN-REVERE:

I don't know if you'd call it

a finding.

It seemed more offhand than that.

But the

Government did -- I mean, the -- the district court did

10

make that assumption despite the evidence that was

11

presented below even by the Government that that wouldn't

be required.

13

Ultimately to resolve the Court -- this case in

14

the Government's favor, they're really asking this Court

15

to make a number of changes, significant changes in -- in

16

First Amendment doctrine.

17

First, they're asking this Court to apply the

18

Pacifica precedent specifically to cable television, which

19

this Court, at least in the past, has declined to do.

20

And secondly, they're asking for the authority

21

to restrict the speech available in all households in a

22

cable community even though they acknowledge that parents

23

are fully able to block the offensive speech in a

24

particular household.

really nothing in this Court's prior decisions -- and as

4

the district court found -- that would justify significant

changes in the law.

There's

6

This is particularly true with respect to the

7

notion of individual user empowerment and as we look at

8

newer technologies.

9

the complete ability of a household to stop offensive

10

speech coming into the home is ineffective and is not

11

sufficient to forestall the need for Government

12

regulation, then it would open a wide avenue for the

13

regulation not just of cable television, but of other new

14

technologies that do empower individuals to take steps on

15

their own either through market-based measures or through

other less restrictive regulatory measures to address

would totally exhaust the revenues, that if 3 to 6 percent

The district court then found that, in fact,

cable operators would drop Playboy before it exhausted all
