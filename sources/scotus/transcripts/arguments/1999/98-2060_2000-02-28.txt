ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD B. FOLEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. FOLEY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This habeas case is about the need for an

12

explanation when a defendant misses his opportunity in

13

State court to assert ineffective assistance of appellate

14

counsel in order to reopen his original direct appeal.

15

The Sixth Circuit here held that no such

16

explanation is necessary before a Federal court in effect

17

may reopen the appeal, but that holding is serious error,

18

because it undermines the State's ability to have the

19

reopened appeal occur in the same court that heard the

20

original appeal.

21

To put the matter more concretely, respondent

22

here is seeking Federal habeas relief on the ground that

23

his guilty plea was invalid but he didn't raise that claim

24

in his original direct appeal.

25

that default ineffective assistance of appellate counsel,

He asserts as cause for

1

but he defaults in his ineffective assistance claim as

2

well.
The State permits a defendant to raise

3
4

ineffective assistance in order to revive a claim

5

originally defaulted on direct appeal, here, the

6

underlying plea-related claim, but respondent did not take

7

advantage of that opportunity in State court in a timely

8

manner under State law, and our position is that his

9

failure to do so requires an explanation before the

10

Federal court can revive that defaulted claim, the plea

11

claim.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Foley, as I understand it, the

13

district court in this case held that there was not an

14

adequate and independent State ground for the State court

15

ruling, and the court of appeals simply didn't pass on

16

that.

Is that right?

17

MR. FOLEY:

18

QUESTION:

That is correct.
So that -- if we were to reverse on

19

your point, that would be open in the court of appeals to

20

the respondent here.

21

MR. FOLEY:

Exactly.

We're asking this Court to

22

reverse on the question presented in the cert petition,

23

and it may remand for further determination on the

24

adequacy issue.

25

QUESTION:

Is there any suggestion here that the

1

respondent can show cause and prejudice for the procedural

2

default of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim?

3

MR. FOLEY:

We don't believe so, and for one

4

reason is that he had a lawyer in 1992 in a time in which

5

he could have raised his ineffective assistance claim, so

6

we don't think he can make out the showing, but no court

7

in this case has yet entertained the cause inquiry.

8

9

QUESTION:

What are we supposed to do with his

claim that, look, this lawyer on appeal, the reason that I

10

didn't file my request on time there is because the Ohio

11

statute which sets up a procedure whereby an appellate

12

court reopens a matter was itself very confused in light

13

of a Supreme Court decision which suggests for this class

14

of case you didn't use that procedure, and therefore there

15

was nothing to use, and that whole matter wasn't clarified

16

until much later and, in respect to the time it was

17

clarified, my thing was timely.

18

Now, that's a very complicated question, but I

19

guess that's what the district court went on here, didn't

20

it, and anyway, what do we do with that?

21

MR. FOLEY:

No, Your Honor.

Respondent here

22

missed multiple opportunities to raise his ineffective

23

assistance claim.

24

appeal, he could have brought that claim in a variety of

25

forums, but he didn't bring it anywhere.

In 1991, at the end of his direct

1

In

992, after the Ohio supreme court decided

2

that Murnahan decision, that decision makes it clear how

3

to bring that claim, and he could have brought it in

4

after that decision, and he had counsel.

5

conviction counsel at that time.

6

QUESTION:

992,

He had new post­

Mr. Foley, may I ask you to back up,

7

because as I understand Justice Breyer's question, you

8

have already said the district court ground is not the

9

issue before us now and that, indeed, if we reverse on the

10

ground on which the Sixth Circuit rested, that would be

11

wide open, that the grounds on which the district court

12

ruled were never passed on by the Sixth Circuit, and they

3

would be open to be considered on remand.

4

MR. FOLEY:

5

QUESTION:

Correct.
So we should focus only on what the

6

Sixth Circuit ruled, because the district court's ruling

7

would be open for review by the Sixth Circuit.

8
9

MR. FOLEY:

Correct.

Respondent makes two

points with respect to the adequacy ground that was not

20

passed on by the Sixth Circuit.

2

obstacle to this Court reaching the question in the

22

petitioner for certiorari, and that's incorrect.

23

question that we raised in the cert petition is properly

24

before this Court.

25

One, he says that's an

It was the question decided by the Sixth

The

1

Circuit, and it was the question that respondent, indeed,

2

asked the Sixth Circuit to decide, and it was respondent's

3

view in the Sixth Circuit that you didn't need to address

4

the adequacy issue and instead decide --

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Foley, do you know whether

6

respondent, in its brief in opposition to certiorari, made

7

that point?

8

MR. FOLEY:

I do know the answer to that, and

9

respondent did not object in the opposition to certiorari

0

on that ground, in effect recognizing that the question

11

was properly presented, suggesting that it wasn't worthy

12

of the Court's review.

3

So to answer your question, Justice Ginsburg,

4

the question the Sixth Circuit decided is properly here.

5

Now, respondent also raises the adequacy issue

6

as an alternative ground.

7

remanded, because the Sixth Circuit didn't reach it, but

8

if this Court does reach that issue as an alternative

9

ground, we think the Court should reject it as without

20

2

Our view is that that should be

merit because, as I was suggesting, for two reasons.
First, he had multiple opportunities to raise

22

his ineffective assistance claim.

He could have raised it

23

at three different times in 3 different years, and the

24

State court ground was that he missed all those

25

opportunities, and secondly, Justice Breyer, in response

1

to your question about the district court's reasoning, the

2

district court's view was that the good cause standard in

3

Ohio law was, there was some variation --

4
5

QUESTION:

Your answer to Justice Ginsburg

resolves my question.
MR. FOLEY:

6

Okay.

Turning, then, to the

7

question that the Sixth Circuit decided, our position is

8

that the Sixth Circuit was wrong, because the State's

9

interest here is to have the plea claim, the originally

10

defaulted claim, heard in the forum that it should have

11

been heard in the first place.
The allegation here is that it would have been

12

3

heard in that forum but for ineffective assistance of

4

counsel.

5

is to rectify that constitutional violation by restoring

6

that plea claim to the forum that it should have been in

7

the first place, but the Sixth Circuit's view frustrates

8

the State's effort to get that claim back into the forum

9

in which it belongs if the Federal court is permitted to

20

entertain that plea claim without any showing of why the

21

defendant, respondent here, did not take advantage of the

22

State court opportunity.

23

If that's true, then what the State wants to do

The State has a process for raising

24

ineffectiveness claims to reopen a direct appeal, and what

25

the Sixth Circuit does is, it substitutes the Federal

court for that process.

It makes the Federal court engage

in exactly the same reopening process, because as the
Federal court hear's that underlying plea claim, and does
so because it finds ineffective assistance is cause, then
the Federal court is doing precisely what the State court
wants to do, and the State court, as this Court's
precedents make clear, the State needs to have the
opportunity to do that.
Now, we're not saying that just because he
missed the State court deadline means that he gets no
habeas review no matter what.

All we're asking for is

that explanation, the cause and prejudice test.

In other

words, it's our position that where the Sixth Circuit
error was was in failing to run this claim through the
cause and prejudice analysis that applies in all
procedural default contexts.

That's what Coleman says.

It talks about the uniformity of procedural default
analysis, and that uniformity should occur in this context
as well.
QUESTION:

What bothers me about it is, I mean,

it's a totally logical argument that you've made and it
is, State, there's a constitutional claim, 1) blocked by
State ground, right?
MR. FOLEY:
QUESTION:

We're talking about the three -Then we have step 2.

(800) FOR DEPO

You can get

1

around the State ground by asserting cause, blocked by a

2

different State ground, i.e., cause wasn't done right, and

3

I suppose you could have cause for getting around State

4

ground 2, which could be blocked by State ground three.

5

They didn't do that one right.

6

And this could go on, like Kepler's epicycles,

7

indefinitely and no human being, let alone a petitioner

8

without any lawyer, would ever understand what to do.

9

Now, the reason I put it is, it seems to me

10

there is a separate and different way to look at it, that

11

of course the substantive claim can be blocked by a State

12

ground that's adequate, but the matter of cause is

13

basically a question for the Federal judge, and that cuts

14

through everything, says of course, with Carrier, you have

15

to present it to the State court so they get a shot, but

16

if they have four other State ground rules that stop it,

17

that's their problem.

18

The matter of cause for getting around -- the

19

matter of, is there a State ground for not hearing the

20

prosecutorial claim, that's up to the State, but the

21

matter of cause for getting around it, that's up to the

22

Federal judge, basically.

23
24
25

Now, isn't that how we handle most matters of
cause, or is it?
MR. FOLEY:

Several responses, Justice Breyer.

1

First, I don't think we have an infinite regress problem

2

here because we only have two steps.

3

defaults, and if respondent can show cause for that second

4

default you don't have to go any further.

5

habeas, Federal habeas relief if he can show cause and

6

prejudice or actual innocence under the test, so you don't

7

have to look for a third, or a fourth, or an infinite

8

regress.

We have two

Now, as to the point about, well, yes it is

10

true, it causes a Federal question, and there's no doubt

11

that the cause inquiry as it applies to that underlying

12

plea claim is a Federal question, but he has asserted

13

ineffective assistance as that cause, and Carrier makes it

14

plain that once he asserts ineffective assistance as the

15

cause he has to do several things.

16

First, he has to meet the Sixth Amendment

17

standard for ineffective assistance.

18

poor lawyering that doesn't meet the Sixth Amendment.

19

secondly, he must exhaust that Sixth Amendment claim in

20

State court.

21

It can't simply be

So Carrier already tells us that when

22

ineffectiveness is asserted as cause we have to go back

23

into the State system and it is not sufficient -- to

24

answer the third point of your question, it's not

25

sufficient simply to have presentment or exhaustion

(800) FOR DEPO

And

1

because, as this Court recognized unanimously last year in

2

O'Sullivan -- this was the point where there was agreement

3

in O'Sullivan -- exhaustion must be coupled with

4

procedural default analysis, and the reason is, as this

5

Court explained, is that procedural default doctrine

6

protects the integrity of the exhaustion rule.

7

So once Carrier says that this ineffectiveness

8

claim, the Sixth Amendment claim, the second part, which

9

is asserted as cause for the underlying plea claim, once

10

that has been raised it has to go back to State court not

11

just for presentment but for proper presentment, and

12

that's why procedural default analysis must apply to both

13

claims, the plea claim and the ineffectiveness claim.

14

Sixth Circuit held to the contrary, and that's why it was

15

erroneous.

16

QUESTION:

The

Is one way, then, to state the

17

difference between the parties in this case that the

18

difference is one of the definition of exhaustion, that

19

he -- that the respondent concedes there has to be

20

exhaustion, but he defines it just in terms of

21

presentment, whereas you agree there has to be exhaustion,

22

but you say exhaustion must be a proper presentment.

23

that the issue in the case?

24
25

MR. FOLEY:

Is

Well, we definitely believe there

must be proper presentment, and we think that's the

procedural default requirement, because exhaustion would

2

be satisfied if a State like Missouri -- which has a

3

strict 90-day deadline, no exceptions whatsoever --

4

exhaustion would be satisfied on day 9

reason for the default.

no matter what the

On day 9 , we know as a matter of the exhaustion

6

7

doctrine there's no further State remedy, but that's not

8

proper presentment, and that doesn't give the State court

9

the opportunity to pass on the claim.

10

meaningful opportunity.
QUESTION:

11
12

There has to be

Yes, I recognize there can be

procedural defaults that are not exhaustion.

Procedural

defaults is the larger category.

of procedural default, as I understand your position, and

that exhaustion means proper exhaustion, not mere

presentment.

position?

Exhaustion is a subclass

Is that a correct statement of your

MR. FOLEY:

9

QUESTION:

Correct.

In other words, he --

And in this case could we resolve the

20

case in your favor by saying that what we're concerned

21

with here is exhaustion as a subset of different kinds of

22

procedural defaults, and that the exhaustion here was not

23

complied with because there was not proper presentment of

24

the claim?

QUESTION:

I -- and maybe you have a different

theory of the case.
MR. FOLEY:

No.

I think in substance we're

saying exactly the same thing.
might be slightly different.

I think my terminology
In other words, I would

reserve the word exhaustion for simply the presentment and
say that the question of proper presentment is what the
default doctrine looks to, but I think in substance we're
saying that a default occurred here because it was timebarred under a higher law.
QUESTION:

Well then, you would agree with the

respondent that exhaustion is satisfied if there's mere
presentment, even though it hasn't been properly
exhausted, and you would say it's something other than
exhaustion.

You're telling me, please don't use

exhaustion as the basis for the decision in my favor.

Use

procedural default as some broader classification.
MR. FOLEY:
QUESTION:

Well -I take it you'd be pleased with a

judgment in your favor under any circumstances.
MR. FOLEY:

Absolutely.

(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

But what is the theory that you think

is the proper one for us to adopt in this regard?
MR. FOLEY:

1

analytically a little clearer to say that exhaustion only

2

asks for whether there's been presentment, or,

3

alternatively, it would be futile to present, because the

4

Court's cases do say that exhaustion is technically

5

satisfied if you can look to a rule, like the Missouri

6

rule, and you know that it would be absolutely futile to

7

present, you've satisfied exhaustion.
QUESTION:

Is it the case that, if I agreed with

you, would I -- is there -- would I be accepting -- would

I have to accept the following:

There are many kinds of cause.

cause happens to be an independent constitutional

violation.

the State doesn't apply its own State ground fairly, you

know.

Now, if I agree with you that they have -- that

21

the State can block consideration of that by saying you

22

didn't apply the right State rules, you didn't satisfy the

23

State requirements for raising that in State court, that

24

applies to all these causes.

QUESTION:

No?

2

MR. FOLEY:

Why not?

Well, I think if I understand

3

correctly we're only saying that the double default

4

situation, if you will, the need to have two causes

5

applies in a situation where it is the constitutional

6

claim, and all we're asking for in this --

7

QUESTION:

But how do I say that?

How do I say,

8

look, you say the reason you didn't raise your

9

constitutional point on time.

Why not?

Because my lawyer

10

was inadequate, and that's cause.

11

to make that claim one time itself, right?

12

3

MR. FOLEY:

Correct.

QUESTION:

All right.

And you say, you have

Now, suppose my claim

were, because the courthouse suffered a hurricane and all

5

the documents were lost, or suppose I say, because the

6

State itself doesn't apply this rule fairly.

7

isn't it equally open to you to come back and say, but you

8

have to make that claim on time?

9

distinguish them?

20
21

Now, why

Now, how could I

I'd love to be able to distinguish

them, but I can't think of a way to do it.
MR. FOLEY:

Well, Carrier answers that question.

22

Carrier itself distinguishes between two kinds of causes.

23

One kind is where it's the independent constitutional

24

claim -- here, the Sixth Amendment claim -- and Carrier's

25

explicit as to that you have to have exhaustion.

As to the earthquake example, Carrier itself

1

2

says that doesn't require exhaustion, so Carrier sets up

3

this analysis, and this case is an easy one under Carrier

4

because it's the exact same claim.

5

ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim, the

6

Sixth Amendment.

7

the line that Carrier draws, this case isn't one of them.

8

This case is the easy case, because it's the same case as

9

Carrier.

10

It's the same

So if there are difficult cases, given

The only ruling that we're asking from this

11

Court in this case is that procedural default analysis

12

accompany the Carrier exhaustion requirement.

Carrier

3

exhaustion requirement already exists, and to reverse the

4

Sixth Circuit is simply to say that procedural default

5

analysis must supplement that exhaustion requirement, and

6

the reasoning for that is the reasoning that this Court

7

has always said, that procedural default analysis should

8

accompany an exhaustion requirement.

9

QUESTION:

May I ask you two questions?

The

20

first question is, am I correct in understanding that we

21

MR. FOLEY:

Absolutely.

QUESTION:

My second question is, the underlying

6

claim here, am I correct in saying that the failure to put

7

in any evidence, other than the statements of the

8

prosecutors that supported a guilty plea, that the absence

9

of witness testimony, is that just a State law requirement

10

or is this a Federal constitutional requirement that there

11

had to be something more?
MR. FOLEY:

12

To answer that question, we don't

13

think there's a Federal constitutional requirement.

14

don't think the claim has merit as a Federal claim, but we

15

do think that Federal claim has been asserted in this

16

case.

QUESTION:

I see.

But is there -- if I

can just try to -- is there a State law requirement that

was perhaps missed in this case that you only get to

21

reasons?

of parts, if I might.

2

that does call for witness testimony in this context, but

3

our understanding of Ohio law is that there can be a

4

waiver of that requirement of sworn testimony, and we

5

believe that waiver occurred on the facts of this case, so

6

we don't believe that there was a violation of Ohio law.

7

First, there is a State statute

MR. FOLEY:

12

I understand that.

I understand.

alternative Federal alpha derivative claim.

3

Just to say one more point about the State's

4

interest, the argument here is that the State doesn't need

5

to have this inquiry take place in State court, and we say

that it does, because again, the State's interest in

reopening a direct appeal is as strong as its interest in

because it's the underlying claim that the State wants to

think that the Sixth Circuit has not respected, and for

that reason we ask that the Sixth Circuit's holding be

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. BODINE:

Yes, you may, Mr. Foley.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Robert Carpenter's appellate ineffectiveness
claim is not procedurally defaulted.

He presented it to

10

the Ohio courts in the manner in which he is entitled to

under Ohio Rule of Appellate Procedure 26 (B) .

12

presented it to the court of appeals and to the supreme

13

was adequate --

QUESTION:

19

MR. BODINE:

Are you talking about an Ohio rule?
Yes, Your Honor.

Rule 26(B) is the

20

process by which Ohio defendants must challenge their

21

appellate counsel's ineffectiveness.

22

specifically challenged that rule at the district court

23

proceedings, saying that it was inadequate, but he argued

24

in the alternative that, if that rule was adequate and

could effectuate the default of his appellate

ineffectiveness claim, he could present cause in prejudice

2

for that default.

3

The Warden did not defend Rule 26(B) at the

4

district court, and never responded to the cause in

5

prejudice arguments.

6

prejudice arguments the Warden now asks this Court to

7

force Mr. Carpenter to present.
The district court agreed with Mr. Carpenter

8

9

Those are the same cause in

that Rule 26 is inadequate because the good cause

10

provision has not been consistently applied by the Ohio

11

courts.

12

Carpenter was denied the effective assistance of counsel,

The district court also determined that Mr.

3

and that he was prejudiced because of that, and

4

accordingly the district court issued a writ of habeas

5

corpus.

6

On appeal before the Sixth Circuit, the circuit

7

did not reach the merits of Rule 26(B) but indicated in

8

dicta that it likely agreed that the rule was inadequate.

9

The Sixth Circuit then agreed that Mr. Carpenter was

denied the effective assistance of counsel --

MR. BODINE:

Right.
There has been no Federal finding

19

in any court that Mr. Carpenter's appellate

ineffectiveness claim is procedurally defaulted, and our

argument is, until there is a cognizable procedural

2

that context this Court has always been focusing on merit

3

claims.

4

procedural default doctrine to merit claims.

All of this Court's authority only applies to

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. BODINE:

How about Stewart v. LaGrand?
Stewart v. LaGrand, as we note in

7

the merit brief, Your Honor, was a case about waiver.

8

Mr. LaGrand waived both his merit claim and his cause

9

argument, and therefore there was technically nothing for

10

this Court to review.

11

LaGrand this Court did note that the cause argument was

12

procedurally defaulted, but it was an alternative holding.

13

If there were no merit claims and no cause arguments

14

presented to this Court, the Court never could have

15

reached that issue.

16

At the tail end of Stewart v.

Just last term, though,

in Strickler v. Greene,

17

the Court dealt with a similar structural argument with

18

respect to a defaulted Brady claim, and in that case the

19

Court held that a defaulted Brady claim and a defaulted

20

cause argument could nevertheless be considered, even

21

though the cause arguments themselves were not properly

22

presented to a State court.

claim was procedurally defaulted.
MR. BODINE:

11

In this case, yes, Your Honor,

default.

MR. BODINE:

QUESTION:

-- I don't see how the Sixth Circuit

judgment can stand in light of Murray v. Carrier.
MR. BODINE:

If that's the case, Your Honor,

21

then the adequacy of the rule certainly would need to be

22

resolved, but Murray v. Carrier does say that before

it need rise to a

2

Murray v. Carrier does not say that the

3

procedural default doctrine applies to ineffective

4

assistance of counsel, and it's our position that an

5

individual only need exhaust that claim, or present it to

6

the State courts, before he can use it as cause in a

7

Federal habeas proceeding, but Mr. Carpenter went far

8

beyond that.

9

presented it to two separate courts, and the claim is not

May I ask a question about the

ineffective assistance of counsel claim?

it, as I understand it, is that counsel just challenged a

MR. BODINE:

No, Your Honor.

Mr. Carpenter was

23

acquitted of the death penalty because in Ohio you cannot

24

plead to the sentence in a capital case.

25

required to go through the sentencing phase hearing, which

The court is

1

QUESTION:

I thought he only was -- eliminated

3

the possibility of the death penalty by reason of the

4

agreement with the State that enabled him to make this

5

plea, and that if you set aside the plea, that would have

6

put everything back to square 1.

7

MR. BODINE:

Honestly, that's how we get around

8

the problem in Ohio.

You can plead guilty to a capital

9

offense in Ohio, but the Court cannot impose a prearranged

10

sentencing, or set a penalty.

11

through the evidentiary process of aggravating

12

circumstances, the mitigating factors, balance them, and

13

make an appropriate determination.

would certainly argue that --

QUESTION:

MR. BODINE:

9

Oh, okay.
-- the sentencing phase, penalty

QUESTION:

Because it seemed to me that counsel

10

might well, even if he had a valid reason for attacking

11

the plea arrangement, it might have been a very sound

12

strategy, just as it was in the initial plea agreement,

13

not to do that, because he wouldn't want to risk the death

14

penalty for his client.

15

MR. BODINE:

Exactly, Your Honor, and as I said,

16

that type of arrangement is how the courts have permitted

17

us to get around the problem with pleading guilty to a

18

capital crime and then, by default, pleading guilty to the

the bottom line, that the district court was just going to

Circuit said no, you go all the way back to square 1.

5

You

no plea.

10

12

MR. BODINE:

I was answering a different

question I think, Your Honor.
What the district court did is, it stopped short

13

in its analysis and granted relief on the ineffective

14

assistance, and thereby required a new appeal.

15

The Sixth Circuit held that the district court

16

should have gone one step further and actually granted the

17

new culpability hearing.

18

you, the question whether or not an individual can then be

19

subjected to the death penalty is certainly -- well, it

hasn't been resolved in this case, definitely.

respect to the cause in prejudice argument, Your Honor?

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. BODINE:

6

If you agreed with my point with

Yes.
Then Mr. Carpenter has proved two

constitutional claims and he is entitled to a new trial.
QUESTION:

7

Why?

Because your basic claim, I

8

take it, is a claim, as you make it, that the Federal

9

Constitution forbids finding a person guilty on the basis

0

that the prosecutor recites the facts, and he doesn't

11

disagree.

12

that said that.

3

I've never seen a Federal constitutional case

The alternative way of looking at your basic

4

claim is that the lawyer gave him ineffective assistance

5

by not raising that very point on appeal, which he would

6

have won on under Ohio law, but then we run into what

7

Justice Stevens said, which is bothering me, too, so

8

what's my bottom line?

9

MR. BODINE:

Two separate claims.

The bottom

20

line in your question, Your Honor, is go back and get the

2

direct appeal.

22

whether or not --

23

That way, you don't run into a question of

on your cause and prejudice claim.

2

because I'm not prepared to say that it's a violation of

3

the Federal Constitution to have this procedure that Ohio

4

doesn't like, but -- you know, maybe it's a violation of

5

Ohio law, but if it's a violation of Ohio law, the claim

6

becomes one of ineffective assistance at the first level,

7

and I don't know about that.

8

MR. BODINE:

Then what do I say,

What the Sixth Circuit said is that

the violation carried with it due process implications,
10

because Ohio has established a procedure to protect

11

against an inappropriate plea to a capital crime.

12

That was the basis for the Federal

13

constitutional violation in the Sixth Circuit, the due

14

process implications that a State has set up a procedure

15

that an individual avails himself on and then does not

16

follow that procedure properly.

17

the Sixth Circuit held, it was appropriate to go back to

18

have a full culpability hearing.

QUESTION:

Under that circumstance,

What about -- what do you think of

20

his responses to the two things that were worrying me on

21

your cause in prejudice point?

22

of course, there is no infinite regress.

levels here.

We're only talking about two

And his other answer was not bad.

5

He

He said that

6

this applies only to instances where the cause happens, by

7

coincidence, to be itself a violation of the Federal

8

Constitution, because that's what Carrier dealt with, so

9

don't worry about suddenly creating this kind of problem

10

with all the other more common causes that are raised.

11

What's your answer?

12

MR. BODINE:

On those two particular points I

3

actually agree, because in this case, no matter how many

4

times the question is asked with respect to what is cause

5

for the default, it is always the ineffectiveness of

6

Mr. Carpenter's original appellate counsel.

7

Secondly, we also agree, and we argued that in

8

our merit brief, it is only the constitutional claims

9

themselves that have to be presented to the States.

If

20

it's a nonconstitutional claim, then there's no

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD B. FOLEY

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. FOLEY:

A few brief points.

First of all,

4

in response to Justice Breyer, one of your questions, the

5

ineffectiveness claim is not an independent basis for

6

relief, given the current posture that the case is in, so

7

if the Sixth Circuit view were to prevail it could only

8

be -- the only habeas relief that could be granted would

9

be on the plea claim, so they can't assert the Sixth

20

Amendment ineffectiveness claim without proceeding under a

21

different track, because under the Sixth Circuit track

22

only the plea claim is --

23

QUESTION:

But even under the Sixth Circuit's

24

view, if I understand it, there would have to be

25

established that it was a Federal constitutional violation

1

of the plea agreement, not merely that it violated Ohio

2

law.

3

MR. FOLEY:

Absolutely correct, and also, just

4

to reiterate, we don't want to concede in any way that

5

there was a violation of Ohio law, and in fact the Court

6

of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit remanded for some further

7

proceeding on this waiver issue, so we want to preserve

8

that point.

9

I thought I heard Mr. Bodine say -- make the

10

argument that was also in his brief that exhaustion's

11

enough in the Ohio context, as opposed to the Missouri

12

example that I gave you where there's a strict 90-day

13

deadline, because -- well, because the Ohio court could

14

have passed on the claim because it has a limited narrow

15

safety valve, and the only point I'd like to make beyond

16

what's in our brief is that there shouldn't be any penalty

17

for a State to have a limited safety valve of that kind

18

and, indeed, in the Engle case that I mentioned earlier,

19

this Court explicitly rejected the idea that cause in

20

prejudice analysis does not apply in that context.

21

The same kind of argument was made, namely,

22

don't do cause in prejudice analysis, where Ohio had

23

another very narrow safety valve, and this Court

24

explicitly rejected that argument, so I think that takes

25

care of that issue as well.

Mr. Bodine mentioned the Strickler case, the

1

2

Brady case, as an example where a constitutional violation

3

can be its own cause.

4

and it may in some fact patterns be true in the

5

ineffective assistance context, and we don't dispute that.

6

Again, all we're asking for here is that the cause inquiry

7

take place, and there may be an example in a different

8

case where you can use ineffective assistance as its own

9

cause.

That is true in the Brady context,

We don't think that's true in this case for a

10

variety of reasons, but the only relief we're seeking from

11

this Court is that that cause inquiry be undertaken, that

12

an explanation be made.

13

And finally Justice Breyer, again, as to the

14

distinction between the earthquake example and the Carrier

15

situation, where it's a constitutional violation, I think

16

Mr. Bodine covered this, but essentially the State's

17

interest here is to rectify constitutional error, so

18

that's why it's important that if there's an allegation

19

that ineffective assistance infected the original State

20

appeal, that there be an opportunity for the State to

21

correct that error when the State has its own procedure to

22

do so, as it does here.

23

That interest doesn't apply in the earthquake

24

context, and so all we're asking is that when a defendant

25

doesn't take advantage of the process the State creates,

that he be put to the explanation to explain why he didn't

take the advantage.
