ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER S. BRASHER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. BRASHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Parole in Georgia is a matter of grace.

Under

11

Georgia's parole system, no life-sentenced inmate ever has

12

any legal expectation of being paroled at any point during

13

their -- during their sentence.

14

discretion of Georgia's parole board is based upon the ad

15

hoc exercise of executive clemency power, and the board

16

does not rely upon any statutory or regulatory standards

17

to exercise that discretion.

18

parole to any inmate within its jurisdiction for any

19

reason at any time, including the interim between

20

mandatory reconsideration dates.

21

Unlike in California, the

Thus, the board can grant

Both the Federal courts and Georgia's courts

22

have agreed that because of its discretion, Georgia's

23

parole system creates no legitimate expectation of parole.

QUESTION:

Well that's -- that's fine for

Fourteenth Amendment purposes, but that's not the test

under -- under the Ex Post Facto Clause.

MR. BRASHER:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. BRASHER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

All right.
However, this Court in Morales

5

reviewed the -- what -- what has been later called the

6

procedural safeguards inherent in California's system to

7

determine if that system, which does create an expectation

8

of parole, changing the parole reconsideration dates had

9

the effect of increasing the measure of punishment.

10
11

However -QUESTION:

Well, isn't the -- the test is

12

whether -- whether there is a so-called sufficient risk

13

that sentences will, in fact, be increased in duration by

14

the change.

15
16
17

Do you agree that's the test?

MR. BRASHER:

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.

That's this -- this Court's test in Morales.
QUESTION:

Well, as I understand it -- you

18

correct me on the facts if I'm wrong, but as I understand

19

it, before the statutory change here, the average sentence

20

served by someone under a life sentence was something in

21

the neighborhood of 12 years, 12 years and some months.

22

MR. BRASHER:

Your Honor, I -- I take issue with

23

that statistic.

That statistic is misleading.

It comes

24

from statistics in 1992, and it deals only with inmates

25

who were actually released on parole.

In 1992, less than

1

50 inmates out of a population of 4,000 life-sentenced

2

inmates were actually released on parole.

And of those -

3
4

QUESTION:

Okay.

Well, let's -- let's take the

5

narrower -- let's take the narrower figure, as -- as you

6

describe it.

7

I also understand that, in fact, following the

8

-- the change in the statute, somewhere in the

9

neighborhood of about 70 percent of those who are given

10

ultimate reconsideration for parole are not given it until

11

after 8 years, so that we're talking about a period of 8

12

years that follows the initial 7-year period.

13

therefore, if anyone in Georgia, subject to parole

14

reconsideration, is going to be paroled -- and -- and I

15

guess we can assume some will be -- those people at least

16

are not going to be considered for 15 years as against the

17

12-year sentence for those who go -- who got parole on

18

some reconsideration theory under the old law.

19

enough to say, yes, the risk of -- of a longer sentence is

20

present here?

21

MR. BRASHER:

No, Your Honor.

And,

Isn't that

First of all,

22

that presumes that the board does not -- well, first of

23

all, it presumes that the board does not know and does not

24

have the power to decide ultimately whether any inmate is

25

ever released on parole.

It's the board that makes that

QUESTION:

2

Well, I don't -- I

don't think -- I

3

don't think that matters one way or the

4

question under the test is -- is whether there is a risk

5

of an increased sentence, the sentence actually served.

6

And it seems to me to follow -- I think it follows from

7

those numbers that there is such a risk.

8

MR. BRASHER:

9

QUESTION:

other.

The -- the

Well, Your Honor --

Regardless of what the board can do,

10

what in fact is going to happen is that if those who will

11

be released on -- following a first reconsideration, 70

12

percent of those are -- are, in fact, going to wait

13

years as against a -- a prior scheme in which there was an

14

average of 12 years.

15

demonstrate just how many are going to get longer

16

sentences, but it does demonstrate, it seems to me, a -- a

17

risk.

18

for 15

Now, that doesn't, by any means,

MR. BRASHER:

But, Your Honor, that again

19

presumes that the board does not have the ability nor the

20

knowledge to determine which inmates it's going to release

21

because these statistics are merely an accumulation of

22

individualized determinations by the board.

23

ultimately has the -- the discretion to determine whether

24

any inmate is released and, more importantly --

QUESTION:

The board

there is an increased risk.
MR. BRASHER:

But, Your Honor, that assumes that

12

those inmates would have gotten out during that interim,

13

but it's the board that makes the determination when they

14

deny parole and set it off.

15

QUESTION:

It assumes -- it assumes -- yes.

assumes that some would have gotten out because of the

QUESTION:

will be released only after 15 years.

MR. BRASHER:

Well, Your Honor, and also that

ignores the fact that -- that in fact the board does have

10

the ability to -- to extraordinarily reconsider inmates

11

and the lodged documents, the first set of lodged

12

documents, demonstrates that, in fact, the board is

13

exercising their discretion to review inmates

14

extraordinarily.

/

15

QUESTION:

It -- it may well do so, and in point

16

of fact, it may do a very good job of it.

17

question under the Ex Post Facto Clause is whether there

18

is in fact a risk of a longer sentence, and it seems to me

19

that those numbers demonstrate that there is some risk.

MR. BRASHER:

that the parole board doesn't know --

That's what the average figure shows.

MR. BRASHER:

Your Honor, again that average is

only of the inmates that were released and not of the

inmates that were denied parole.

7

a true picture of how long inmates serve in prison, you

8

have to consider three numbers.

9

first of all, how many inmates of the -- of the -- the

That -- in order to get

You have to consider,

10

inmates that are quoted in the misleading 12-year figure,

11

how many of those inmates were released at their initial

12

consideration date, which is not indicated, which would

13

have been 7 years.

14

at 7 years, we have an inmate that's serving 19 years in

15

incarceration.

16

that 12-year number.

17

So, for every inmate that's released

That -- that demonstrates the fallacy of

In addition to that number, you also have to

18

have how many inmates died in prison and ultimately served

19

their life sentence.

20

And then finally, you have to know how many of

21

those inmates are still in prison.

22

-- is fallacious because it leads one to believe --

That -- that number is

should look at?

MR. BRASHER:

Well, Your Honor, I believe that

in place in -- in California and determined whether there

14

was a sufficient likelihood that it would have the impact

15

of increasing the sentences.

were determined to be important for California onto

Georgia's system.

numbers, your position is the numbers are really

MR. BRASHER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

executive clemency is exercised, that does not give rise

QUESTION:

It -- we're dealing with a much

Doesn't it

10

just stand to reason that there are going to be people who

11

would have gotten out if it were only 3 years who won't

12

get out if it's 8?
MR. BRASHER:

13

No, Your Honor, because the -- the

14

idea of the 8-year rule that's been -- that's been

15

advanced by respondents is again fallacious because the

16

rule is only what it is to each individual inmate.

17

numbers that Justice Souter referred to demonstrate, the

18

rule is not an 8-year rule because then 100 percent of the

1

inmates would be set off for 8 years.

20

it's a rule that applies an 8-year cap to the

21

reconsideration interval and allows the board, the same

22

board that makes the determination if that inmate ever

23

gets out, to determine how frequently they should consider

We put this -- we put this before the Court

Well, then it -- then it does no good

to keep responding these are all individualized

We know that.

But the fact is, when you

look at -- at the span of them over a number of years, you
can draw some generalized conclusions.

And if, before

this change was put into effect, the individualized
determinations let out 50 percent of the lifers before
their term was up and afterwards it let out only 5 percent
of the lifers before their term was up, that would be
significant despite the fact that they're all individual
determinations.

What do -- what do the statutes of

Georgia say about entitlement to consideration for parole

How?

MS. KERTSCHER:

That the inmate is entitled to

And -- and the

-- the legislature does tell the board that it has to have

So, then I think Mr. Brasher was not

correct in saying that under the legislation the board can

You say under the statute they couldn't do that.
MS. KERTSCHER:

QUESTION:

Well, that being so, I mean, I -- I

didn't understand the Eleventh Circuit at all, that part
of their opinion dealing with the rule.

I didn't

understand it because I've never heard of a constitutional
principle that says that it's unconstitutional to have a
constitutional rule because maybe you'd change it.
I mean, that -- that -- so -- so I take it that
the issue in front of us is the old policy was the policy,
every 3 years no matter what.

The new law or rule or

policy or reg is that you don't get considered for 8 years
automatically but we postpone it only if we decide that
earlier consideration would do you no good, and if there's
either a change in circumstance or any new information,
tell us and we will decide whether to give you the hearing
sooner.

Okay?

Now, that is what, I take it, we're trying

to decide.
Now, you -- now, the question is why is that
harsher?
And number one, you say maybe the person won't
know about it.

Well, I haven't found anything in the

record here that suggests anybody doesn't know about it.
Number two, because there's a burden of inertia.

We don't know why Mr. Inmate got this

situation in which if Mr. Newberry was suitable for parole

judgment now is going to be possible, and somebody would

argue, oh, you know, if you didn't have a summary judgment

That has not changed, but it's

when you're talking about a period of time as long as 8

MS. KERTSCHER:

No, Your Honor, and although

5

counsel for petitioners said that came up at the Eleventh

6

Circuit, that -- that never was addressed at the Eleventh

7

Circuit level.

8

I'm willing to -- to accept counsel's
representations that there was such a rule in 1

5 because

10

this policy statement and -- and the ability of inmates to

11

request this expedited consideration has been shown not to

12

be a sufficient safeguard to really prevent these inmates

13

from spending longer times in jail under the 8-year rule

14

than they would under the 3-year rule.

15

What's also noticeably absent in this system is

16

a safeguard that this Court relied on very heavily in the

17

Morales case, and that was the ability of the California

18

board, after the fact, to go back and advance the ultimate

1

release date in the event that there had been an error or

20

some unforeseen change in circumstances.

In conclusion, Your Honor, the Georgia system on

its face provides far too great a risk for inmates to

serve an increased term of confinement under the 3 --

under the 8-year rule than they would under the 3-year
