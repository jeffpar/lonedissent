ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAY A. SEKULOW

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SEKULOW:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Santa Fe Independent School District has adopted

11

12

a neutral policy which simply permits student-led,

13

student-initiated speech at football games.

14

which can be found in its entirety at pages 104 and 105 of

15

the joint appendix, allows for the individual student to

16

determine the content of the message.

17

include a prayer at the student's discretion.

18

does not violate the Establishment Clause, and the United

19

States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is wrong and

20

should be reversed.

The policy,

That message may

The Santa Fe policy creates a venue for student

It is neutral as to religious or secular

sportsmanship and student safety, and establishing the

appropriate environment for competition.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. SEKULOW:

Restraints, are they not?
I think it's similar to the

4

topical restriction that you would see in a limited public

5

forum case, a Rosenberger, for instance, in the situation

6

there, where it had to be related to educational mission.

7

Clearly -QUESTION:

8
9

Well, it's a little more precise and

constrained than that, is it not?

For example, could the

10

message be, break their necks, make them wrecks, buckle

11

down, boys?
MR. SEKULOW:

12
13
-

In fact --

I would think the school

district --

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. SEKULOW:

I think the school district would

16

have the authority, and that's more of a Bethel v. Fraser

17

question than an Establishment Clause issue.

18

under normal school district authority they can control

19

the nature of what's going to be said in that regard.

20

I think

The policy also specifically states that it can

21

be utilized to establish the appropriate environment for

22

competition.

23

but that would be a neutral criteria applied.

24

not be

25

Clearly, Justice Ginsburg, that would not,

It would

Establishment Clause problem, what if somebody chose to

2

speak on the subject that, all religion's bunk?

3

MR. SEKULOW:

4

QUESTION:

We --

I mean, does that comport with the --

5

I'm not sure what solemnizing a football game is, but

6

assuming there is such a process --

7

(Laughter.)

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. SEKULOW:

-- would that comport with it?
Well, I think that in a situation

10

like that it would be perfectly appropriate, if the

11

student felt that was going to create the appropriate

12

environment for competition, to engage in that kind of

13

speech.

14

policy here.

15

This is a broad policy.

It's not this limited

For instance --

QUESTION:

Then what does -- just tell me --

16

maybe this is not important, but what is it, what would it

17

be to solemnize a football game?

18

would require religion, or require religious messages to

19

sound religious, and you say no, it doesn't.

20

MR. SEKULOW:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. SEKULOW:

I thought at least it

No, I --

What is solemnization here?
Solemnization is bringing about

23

respect, honor, and dignity, and a secular invocation,

24

even, could take place.

25

but a secular solemnized message --

It doesn't have to be religious,

QUESTION:

What is a secular invocation?

2

MR. SEKULOW:

Let every one here -- I ask

3

everybody's participation for student safety, and let's

4

encourage good sportsmanship.

5

That's petitioning for assistance.

6

7

QUESTION:

That's an invocation.

Well, that's a nice speech, but it's

not what we normally mean by invocation.

8

MR. SEKULOW:

9

QUESTION:

But even --

And one of the problems, it seems to

10

me, with your case, and one of the problems with the

11

premise of your argument is that it assumes that this

12

language, which we see on the face of the policy now, is

13

descriptive of what, in fact, is going on.

14

And I will be candid to say that it seems to me

15

that it is asking us to shut our eyes to what the sequence

16

of provisions for this practice shows, and the sequence of

17

provisions shows that we started out with a student

18

chaplain and an invocation and, after the lawsuit was

19

brought, the student chaplain became a speaker, and the

20

invocation gained the alternative of a noninvocation, but

21

it seems to me that there isn't a very realistic basis to

22

suggest that anything different is going on, or intended

23

to go on, from what went on and was intended to go on

24

before the lawsuit.

25

MR. SEKULOW:

First, this is a facial challenge,

1

and the respondents bear the burden here of establishing

2

that there's no basis upon which the policy can be

3

implemented in a constitutional way.
Secondly, there's an independent circuit-breaker

4
5

here.
QUESTION:

6

But the -- on a facial challenge, we

7

are not required to close our eyes to the context in which

8

the language has come to be.

application, e.g., a Hail Mary.
MR. SEKULOW:

10
11

We don't wait for a specific
I guess --

Hail Mary would probably be

appropriate.
QUESTION:

12

But we don't wait for that, but we

13

don't close our eyes to the context in which the policy

14

arose.

15

MR. SEKULOW:

I think that's correct, and the

16

context upon which this policy arose was after the

17

decision in Lee v. Weisman litigation in this case arose,

18

this school district, pursuant to a district court order,

19

adopted a policy which was actually broader than the

20

district court's order, and here I think it's important to

21

emphasize that the individual student selected, if, in

22

fact, there is a decision to have a student give a

23

message, that that student is the circuit-breaker.

24

student determines the message.

25

what that student's going to say.

QUESTION:

MR. SEKULOW:

3

QUESTION:

4

Let me ask you about that -Yes, Justice.

-- Mr. Sekulow, and to conserve your

time I'll just state my concern --

5

MR. SEKULOW:

6

QUESTION:

Sure.

-- rather than ask a series of

7

questions.

8

a saving feature of the program, yet an election doesn't

9

mean anything without a campaign, and if we had a campaign

I assume that the election is offered to us as

10

it seems to me that the students might say, I will be a

11

very good speaker, representative of the school, because I

12

am well-trained and well-motivated to give inspirational

13

prayers.

14

in school, and they have a school election, based on the

15

issue of whether or not there should be prayer.

16

Another student has a poster saying, no prayers

Now, that is the kind of thing, I think, that

17

our Establishment Clause wants to keep out of the schools.

18

We have a school electoral mechanism, a governmental

19

mechanism for selecting a speaker, and one of the criteria

20

is, I should think, whether or not prayers are going to be

21

given.

22

MR. SEKULOW:

23

QUESTION:

There's two responses --

And if -- and I'll just finish.

And

24

if it's not, then it seems to me we're just avoiding the

25

question, and the hard question is, can you give a prayer?

1

MR. SEKULOW:

Well, there is not a majority vote

2

on prayer in this case.

3

structure is set up, the individual student determines

4

content and, secondly, with regard to the approach here,

5

that individual student will make the decision whether, in

6

fact, to include a secular message or a religious message.

7

QUESTION:

First of all, the way that the

But the point of the question, of

8

course, is that there may well be a campaign among

9

students to be chosen and, if that's the situation, then

10

11

how do you respond to Justice Kennedy's question?
MR. SEKULOW:

The district court -- and this

12

policy came out of the context of a district court order,

13

which specifically stated that there would be no

14

campaigning allowed on campus.

15

by the district court judge and served as the basis --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. SEKULOW:

Now, that was implemented

But it could be off-campus.
Sure it could, certainly, but

18

again there is an independent speaker here, and that is

19

the student and no one knows, whether they campaigned or

20

not, what that high school student might say, and I think

21

specifically to strike this policy down requires that the

22

Establishment Clause now place an affirmative obligation

23

on the school district to censor only the religious

24

message of the student and that --

MR. SEKULOW:

And we stay neutral.

This school

15

district has adopted a hands-off policy.

itself states, on page 104 of the joint appendix, that the

student volunteer who is selected by his or her classmates

may decide what message or invocation to deliver.

Yes, but what do we do about the

MR. SEKULOW:

I think the history is relevant

this particular case, this school district is trying to

jurisprudence by adopting a neutral -QUESTION:

Mr. Sekulow, would it comply equally

well if the school district said, now, football is a big

event in this school district and everybody comes to the

7

game Friday night, so we want to have everybody, all the

registered voters -- there are more adults than the school

They are interested in what's going on.

The

will be people who come forward as volunteers, same thing.

would be whether the -- a school district would have the

I suspect not.

want to use the democratic process.

MR. SEKULOW:

Mr. Sekulow, I don't think that --

perhaps I didn't convey clearly enough what I meant.

because that sounds like the Government designating the

15

Here, too, the student -- these are not students

Well, we had a case decided just this

That's correct, and in Southworth

10

the concern was the issue of viewpoint neutrality in

regard to majoritarian vote.

12

neutrality is expressed in that the individual student is

the speaker, and there is no majoritarian vote under this

policy.

Here, the viewpoint

This is a plurality.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't have too much -- in

me what we're concerned about is avoiding the schools

MR. SEKULOW:

There would be very serious First

QUESTION:

5

Now, if we don't adopt that wooden,

rigid rule, then we still are looking for some mechanism

to ensure neutrality, to keep divisiveness out, and I

haven't seen what it is in this case.
MR. SEKULOW:

QUESTION:

10

The neutrality -- sorry.

I think the election thing doesn't

work, for the reasons I suggested and that Justice

12

Ginsburg has been asking you about.
MR. SEKULOW:

13

Well, I think the ultimate

14

circuit-breaker exists here even under this election

context, and that is, the independent, individual student

who decides to make the message, if they're selected by

their peers, determines the content.

Okay.

and I'm saying, if the student who is given this neutral

MR. SEKULOW:

All speech is protected by the

would be placed in the position of censor if they were to

determine that that was not going to be allowed.

That may be a weakness in

Rosenberger, but it has nothing to do, it seems to me,

with the point that is being raised here.

Is there a distinction between prayer

worst of the school officials involved and of the students

who will ultimately be the speakers under this policy,

which has yet to be applied because its application has

been suspended while this litigation goes forward.

6

We submit that under the standard of review of a

facial challenge that respondents' burden is heavy to show

8

that it could never be constitutionally applied, and we

9

believe this school district, just as in Agostini, is

10

entitled to the presumption that school officials will

11

faithfully discharge their duties according to the law, as

12

laid down by this Court.

There is no evidence to support the conclusions

But that's your basic substantive

I mean, that was the -- I understand that.
Is there any -- I mean, there are prayers in

public places, they're called invocations, in Congress,

here, at the inauguration of the President and so forth,

and I gather that in Texas this is a big community event,

but I take it no one is saying that for that reason they

11

could have an invocation of God's name.
GENERAL CORNYN:

13

Well, the only reason we

believe --

14

QUESTION:

I mean, it's --

GENERAL CORNYN:

--

that this policy is

constitutional is because it is neutral with regard to the

2

So if you're going to assert on a facial

challenge that you have a neutral criterion, what reason

4

is there to believe in this case that, over time, what we

will see as a result of the policy the State has

initiated, that there will be the full spectrum of speech

resulting?

GENERAL CORNYN:

Of course, this facial

challenge, the policy that has yet to actually be applied,

10

we can only be left to speculate, but let me suggest that

11

in Bethel v. Fraser, Matthew Fraser, who was disciplined

12

for making a sexually explicit speech when nominating a

13

fellow student for student council, was later elected by

4

his peers to speak at the graduation ceremony, and I think

15

respondent's argument is really just wrong in that it

16

assumes what the nature of the speech will ultimately be,

17

the criterion upon which the student will be selected.

18

QUESTION:

General, I assume that that statement

19

in Rosenberger, which said the full spectrum of political

20

speech, focused on political speech because that's what

21

the policy that the school put in place was intended to

22

foster.

If it's a limited-purpose forum in this case I

think all you would have to defend is that there would be

pause in memory of the members of the football team last

4

Why would you want to defend the proposition

5

that all manner of political speech would -- I mean,

6

surely all manner of political speech wouldn't be allowed

in this case.

GENERAL CORNYN:

It's only solemnizing speech that -Under Cornelius and other cases

by this Court the school officials can keep the students

on topic for the purpose for which the opportunity to

11

speak is allowed, but solemnization -QUESTION:

12

Let's assume that they stay on topic

and, taking Justice Ginsburg's question as limited to

14

that, I think she's asking a factual question, not a

question about precedent but a question about fact, what

could be expected, and let me just add a footnote to her

an Establishment Clause point of view, this is a

13

itself seems to leave minority religions out more.

14

mean, instead of a general prayer, you'd have something

that reflected the majority view, which is understandable,

but from the point of view of the -- I'm not saying it's a

bad speech.

it for one reason or another, can sue anonymously?

there is a threat of intimidation, if there's a threat of
violence, if there's a threat -- and I think there was

most fundamental things that happened in the hearing after

the district court had gone through the problem of the

5

injunction, after the district court had instructed not to

ferret out the names, after the court had heard testimony

7

in terms of intimidation, the district court looked at the

8

plaintiff, known as Susan Doe in the record, and he asked

9

her, what is the big deal?

And she looked at the court and she said, I

11

teach my children at home religion, and I don't want to go

down, and I don't think it's necessary for me to go down

13

to the school and interview every one of the teachers and

14

find out their religious faith.

15
16

That's the backdrop of

In this case, the policy of Santa Fe Independent

MR. GRIFFIN:

Justice Scalia, I think that's a

Is that so strange that an attorney

MR. GRIFFIN:

It's strange in this context, that

you have a official policy that's still in existence in

1996, 1995 that defines a chaplain to do prayer at all

That isn't the present policy, is it?

MR. GRIFFIN:

Well, it changes, and if I can

I'm curious to know why you're going

into these antecedent details when the question we granted

MR. GRIFFIN:

Two reasons, Your Honor.

If we go

And how does that bear on your

argument?
MR. GRIFFIN:

Well, two points.

There were

MR. GRIFFIN:

And they can elect to give, they

who will not give a prayer.

QUESTION:

But you can't say that in every case

it's going to produce a prayer.

You just can't.

Now, you

may suspect that in most cases it will, but you know, when

we appoint chaplains in the Armed Forces on the basis of

11

what the needs of the members of the Armed Forces are, you

can predict that the majority of them are going to be

Christian chaplains, but that doesn't mean that the

There's nothing in the face of this policy that allows --

has stood before this Court and said, well, if it's

outside the realm, we can -- the student can still be

7

There are still governmental problems.

somebody can get up and say religion is bunk.

He

was designed, and it's the same thing at football games.

You can still, in my

way of thinking, maintain a facial challenge even if it

QUESTION:

Oh, then therefore anything that

could lead to some sectarian controversy is not

unconstitutional.

Absolutely.

You cannot eliminate that possibility

entirely.

You're right on the point I'd like

you to address, because whether it's a straight line or a

MR. GRIFFIN:

QUESTION:

Schools are different.

Because?
Because --

Anything associated with a school is

14

more likely to be on the impermissible side of the line,

MR. GRIFFIN:

Absolutely.

Because?
Anyone --

Because?
Because children need that type of

protection.

Children, the school district works as a

parent.

cases oftentimes says that these children can be

disciplined because they work as parents, and they don't

have the same rights as an adult.

QUESTION:

1

But Mr. Griffin, some school

functions are educational.

The school is acting as a

parent to the children, teaching them, education.
But other school functions in many communities

are social.

It's the focus of social activity, and my

impression is that that's what school football games are

in Texas.

There's very little of the instructional

I'll bet you there are even people

who go to those games who don't have any kids in the

2

school system, as well as the pep rally that we hold

3

during the school, before we ever -- if a major game is

4

coming up, there's a pep rally, and we let everybody out,

5

and we go idolize our football game.
So I respectfully disagree that with respect to

6

7

football, football is football, and it is part of our

8

system.
QUESTION:

But in stressing the importance of

10

football, I don't understand you to be making a

11

distinction between, say, dramatic plays, other assemblies

12

that might be less popular in the community.

13

say that this policy would be all right if it were limited

14

to school concerts, school dramas, any place where the

15

schoolchildren are assembled?

16

MR. GRIFFIN:

Would you

No, I would not say this policy

17

would be all right under drama or any other play, or any

18

other circumstance and the reason is, it still should

1

apply to football as well as baseball, as well as drama,

20

is because there's still that pressure.

21

When we get those slips to tell us that we have

22

to spend extra money to buy a uniform for our child that

23

we don't want to go to, we're compelled as parents because

24

our school districts expects it of us, so it applies

across the board.

QUESTION:

Excuse me, social compulsion is

3

certainly not enough.

I mean, in many communities you

4

could say, oh, all the kids belong -- they're socially

5

compelled to belong to the Boy Scouts.

6

render the Boy Scouts, you know, the Government for

7

purposes of what things it can do and can't do.

MR. GRIFFIN:

QUESTION:

10

That doesn't

I agree.

So you can't just use social pressure

Slone as the justification.
MR. GRIFFIN:

11

And I have not attempted to do

12

that.

13

concern that football was somehow different and it was

14

outside the realm of the regular function, the classroom,

15

and that we can somehow say, well, since it's football,

16

let's just let them pray, let's let them do anything they

17

want.

I have attempted, Justice Scalia, to address your

And there's not a school district in this

country -- they would cringe, and the administrators would

20

cringe if I as a lawyer stood up in front of a board and

21

said, you know what, this is football, they should be able

22

to do anything they want, and I think that's what I was

attempting to address.

not depend on the outcome of a vote.
This Court has also said in Southworth that

majoritarian vote is simply not viewpoint-neutral, and

5

this whole notion that somehow this becomes viewpoint-

6

neutral as we change the words from chaplain to message --

excuse me, to invocation, and then message or invocation,

is to put our heads in the sand and ignore the culture and

the historical phenomenon of what is happening in Santa

The idea that a student in a talent show would be told, it

would be appropriate to sing John Lennon's song, Imagine,

speech, even if it was just a message policy.
QUESTION:

Well, there is only one speech under

the policy that the school board has adopted.

you're bringing in all the cases where the religious group

speaker.

7

That's why

Here, whoever speaks, it's just one

No one else can talk.
MR. SEKULOW:

Well, in that context, the Equal

8

Access Act was triggered if there was only one

9

noncurriculum-related student group, so the fact that it's

10
11

one speaker -QUESTION:

12

equal access.

13

not one among many.

Then there -- there's another to have

Here, there isn't.

MR. SEKULOW:

It's one alone.

student determines the content of their message.

that the student volunteer who is selected determines the

content of the message.

There is

It states on page 104

That is private speech.

To make -- to have these individual students

21

become Government speakers -- and that's what this would

22

require, that an individual student, selected by her

23

peers, determines to give a content of a message, say a

24

nonprayer, just talks about the importance of

25

sportsmanship, that student message would be okay.

But if

1

that same student the next week, or the next home football

2

game, were to give a prayer -QUESTION:

3

If under this policy it turned out

4

that every speech was an invocation, including of the

5

Deity, then what would you say about an as-applied

6

challenge?

7

MR. SEKULOW:

Well, I would say this is a facial

8

challenge and that would be an as-applied challenge, and

9

there would have to be empirical evidence that, in fact,

10

there was forum domination.
But here again, though, this is individual

2

student speech, and even if there was one student speaker,

3

that student made -- the first week of the home football

4

game give a secular message, and the next week a prayer,

5

there's no -- the student is the circuit-breaker here, and

6

the important issue in our view is that in fact you were

7

to have this policy, which does protect a message and/or

8

invocation.

To strike it down requires there be an

20

affirmative obligation to censor a student speaker, and

that would be because the student speaker might -QUESTION:

But the student speaker, at least on

this record that we have, and we have a brief to that

doing.

to do.

In fact, didn't she even sue to establish her

2

right to say a prayer?

3

MR. SEKULOW:

The Court's referring to the Ward

4

litigation and interesting, there, the school district was

5

actually sued because, in trying to comply with the Fifth

6

Circuit Court of Appeals decision, they adopted a

7

guideline that said, message only, and specifically stated

8

that there would be no religious message being allowed to

9

be given at all, and a district court judge issued a

10

temporary restraining order saying that that's viewpoint

11

discrimination, which is exactly our point.
QUESTION:

12

But you're switching from the point

13

that I was making.

14

have to wait when we're told, I'm going to be honest about

15

it.

I want to give a prayer, not some message.
