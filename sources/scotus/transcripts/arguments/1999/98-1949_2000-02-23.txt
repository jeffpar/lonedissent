CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10

I think it is no exaggeration to suggest that

11

the future of medical care, both in its delivery and in

12

its regulation, are in some way implicated by the Court's

13

decision today.

ERISA, then all managed care does so as well.

As Judge Easterbrook said in his

Accordingly, the question is whether or not the

20

court needs to have that kind of a dramatic effect on the

21

managed care industry in this particular context, and I

22

suggest to you that the answer to that is no, because

23

there is a perfectly available and valid remedy for the

24

people in Ms. Herdrich's position, and that is medical

QUESTION:

1

Well now, I gather that the Ms.

2

Herdrich did recover in a malpractice action in this very

3

case.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

In this very case, Justice

5

O'Connor, she -- the defendants were found liable, and she

6

received $35,000 as full compensation for her -- for the

7

injuries that she suffered.

8

that determination, that there's been an error in judgment

9

and that it fell below the standards of care for medical

There's no question, based on

10

malpractice purposes, and that there are available

11

perfectly valid remedies under State law to her.
The question then is, is there some reason to

12

13

add over those perfectly complete remedies under State law

14

an ERISA remedy as well, and while I think that question

15

can be posed out of narrowly -QUESTION:

16
17

some reason.

18

right?

20

The question isn't whether there's

The question is whether it's been added,

MR. PHILLIPS:
Scalia.

The question -- does Congress intend for -QUESTION:

23

there.

24
25

That's absolutely true, Justice

MR. PHILLIPS:

It's either there or it's not

That's right.

The question is

whether Congress intended to add ERISA over and above the

1

malpractice law, and I think it's important in making that

2

determination to realize that this is essentially a zero-

3

sum situation.

4

law under ERISA, the more you have to narrow State law

5

because of the ERISA preemption provision under section

6

514(a) .

That is, to the extent you expand Federal

7

That says that every matter that is within plan

8

administration, everything that relates to an ERISA plan,

9

right, and therefore is protected under Federal law,

10

preempts all State law that's related to it, and it seems

11

to me quite clear under those circumstances that the court

12

should be quite loath to expansively interpret ERISA, and

13

certainly there's very little evidence that Congress meant

14

to do so.
QUESTION:

15

Mr. Phillips, would you clarify one

16

thing?

17

plain vanilla scheme, and yet your opponents say that it's

18

only a particular kind of HMO, one where the physicians

19

have this incentive because of their bonuses, and that not

20

all HMO's work that way.

21

You said all HMO's would fall because this is a

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think actually Judge

22

Easterbrook, in his dissenting opinion below, had the

23

better of that argument, and he argued, and I think quite

24

rightly, that the allegations in the respondent's

25

complaint basically lay out the kinds of incentives that

are inherent in any managed care operation in terms of

2

questions of medical necessity, experimental treatment --

3

all of the elements that go into trying to control what

4

was in the

5

system are embodied in the Carle Clinic's managed care

plan, so in that sense I don't think it is significantly

7

different from any other managed care operation, Justice

Ginsburg.

one simple point for me?

2

for the malpractice, what do you understand the nature of

her recovery would be?

Perhaps I should ask your

Maybe you should ask him that question.
My understanding is, first she's made no claim

8

for damages under ERISA, and for good reason.

9

none available.

There are

There are no benefits that she has not

20

been provided under any plan, however you want to define

21

it, and so there's no basis for recovery there.

22

no injunctive relief, so I don't know that, and indeed the

23

amended Count III focuses on some kind of a treatment with

24

respect to a pot of money when -- and with respect to a

25

plan that simply doesn't exist, so I have no idea what it

She seeks

is that respondent thinks that she will gain from this,

2

except perhaps attorney's fees.
Obviously there is a provision for attorney's

3
4

fees under ERISA, but in terms of her own stake in this,

5

it seems to me it is quite ephemeral, and -- I'm sorry, go

6

ahead.

QUESTION:

You don't contend there isn't really

a live case here, though?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Oh, no.

I don't contend there

10

isn't a live case.

What I do contend is that it's -- you

11

know, if you go down this path, at the end of the process

12

you're going to be hard-pressed to come up with much of a

13

remedy that's going to make any difference to her at this

14

stage in the process.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. --

16

QUESTION:

Well, you agree there's not a live

case if she's not seeking any remedy?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, she is -- I mean, what she

is seeking --

QUESTION:

Is a judgment, but not a remedy.

MR. PHILLIPS:

QUESTION:

MR. PHILLIPS:

Is a judgment with --

A judgment is not a remedy.
No, no, I understand that,

Justice Scalia, but what she is seeking is -- I mean, her

claim is that there is a pot of money and that that pot of

basis for that logically in terms of how this scheme works

3

out, but that's not a basis to claim there's no

4

jurisdiction.

5

I don't think there's any

That's simply a basis to answer Justice Stevens'

6

question which is, at the end of the day, when it's all

7

said and done, if she got everything she wanted out of

8

this, what's likely to come out of it?

9

isn't much but, again, respondent may be in a better

10
11
12

My sense is there

position to analyze that.
QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, are there any

circumstances under which an HMO can be found to be a

3

fiduciary, for instance, in administering claims or

4

benefits to which a covered employee is entitled?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think there are some

6

circumstances in which that would be certainly the case

7

under the narrower of -- narrowest of the theories that we

8

put forward in opposition to the judgment below.

9

We do have one theory in this case regarding the

20

scope of the definition of the term, plan.

21

I'm not sure there would be any circumstances where the

22

HMO would be -- have fiduciary responsibilities, but under

23

our narrower interpretation we don't really disagree with

24

the United States that if, in fact, you're talking about

25

an HMO that's making coverage or claim determinations

Under that,

1

wholly apart from medical treatment decisions, and I want

2

to get to that in a second, it could potentially be a

3

situation where there would be some potential fiduciary

4

responsibility, but then that raises a whole slew of

5

questions with respect to what kinds of incentive plans,

6

or incentive arrangements might breach that fiduciary duty

7

and the issues that stem from that inquiry, none of which,

8

I submit to you, is posed in this particular case.
QUESTION:

9

Why is that?

Do we know that there

10

are no such coverage determinations being made by this

11

HMO?
MR. PHILLIPS:

There is no allegation in the

complaint as it's defended before this Court with respect

to coverage allegations.

1

QUESTION:

Thank you.

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

-- and I'll just quote it.

The

3

sole focus of attention of amended Count III is the design

4

and administration of an undisclosed physician incentive

5

to withhold treatment.

6

I think the only fair way to interpret that

7

language is to say that what we're talking about here is

8

basically the provision of care, the provision of medical

9

care and the methods of compensation.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

QUESTION:

3

To people who are covered?
Yes.

To people who are covered, not

excluding people from coverage?

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

5

QUESTION:

Suppose you --

6

QUESTION:

But Mr. Phillips, maybe -- maybe your

Right, exactly.

7

opponent thought it unnecessary to say anything to that

8

effect because in your very own memorandum in opposition

9

to the plaintiff's motion to remand to the State court you

20

allege that -- and this is on page 24a of the brief in

21

opposition -- you allege that Health Alliance was the

22

administrator and fiduciary of the plan within the meaning

23

of ERISA, so if you yourself alleged that Health Alliance

24

was the administrator, then certainly you lull the other

25

side into security on that point.

You had conceded it.

MR. PHILLIPS:

1

Well, I think you have to read

2

that in context, Justice Ginsburg.

3

conceded it for purposes of the disclosure issues and the

4

bad faith claims that were the basis for the remand order,

5

or the remand issue in that context.

6

conceded that we were a fiduciary for purposes of the

7

amended Count III complaint.

We have never

We have consistently argued that we have no

9

I mean, we certainly

fiduciary responsibilities with respect to claims in Count

10

III, and in any event, even if the respondent's memory

11

lasted long enough to sort of have that uppermost in her

12

mind at the time she filed her brief in this Court, we had

13

clearly laid out our theory of this case, which is that we

14

are not a fiduciary for these purposes.

15

Her defense of the judgment below is very

16

focused, and I think it spares the Court a significant

17

amount of time and energy having to sort out a variety of

18

the issues that have frankly divided the Solicitor General

19

and the petitioners in this case, questions of what goes

20

into plan design as opposed to fiduciary responsibilities,

21

questions of how broadly do you define the plan and its

22

benefits.

2

within the meaning of section 1002(21) (A) , which is the

3

definition provision in ERISA for a fiduciary, and it is

4

completely counterintuitive to suggest that plan

5

administration extends to the provision of medical care,

6

just as a matter of simple language of the statute.
And then second, and what I think is really the

7
8

most driving force in all of this, is the relationship

9

between Federal and State law, because it seems to me

10

absolutely inconceivable that if the Court were to decide

11

that these kinds of medical treatment judgments and the

12

compensation schemes that go into them are, in fact,

13

administration of an ERISA plan, that that then doesn't

14

preempt all State law that relates to those issues, which

15

means -QUESTION:

doctors to tell them this type of thing.
MR. PHILLIPS:

I think there is a possibility of

3

a situation like that arising.

4

allegation in the complaint here.

5

situation, though, you still have to take a very careful

6

look at, you know, if we're just talking about a physician

7

making a statement and making a mistake, I don't think

8

that's part of the exercise of discretion in plan

9

administration.

10

That's certainly not the
I think in that

That's simply potentially a breach of

contract that somebody could deal with differently.

11

You know, the key here is, to what extent do you

12

want to drive in the elaborate mechanisms of ERISA as part

3

of an effort to interfere with the relationship between

4

the physicians and the patients in the HMO context, and my

5

own judgment is the Court would be quite better served by

6

trying to move ERISA back further in the scheme of things,

7

but at a minimum it certainly shouldn't be intruded into

8

the physician-patient relationship to the extent of

9

deciding what kinds of medical treatment judgments are

20

valid, and what kinds of compensation schemes are

21

permissible.

22

QUESTION:

Do we talk about the employee or the

23

patient's legitimate expectation as to what that employee

24

is receiving from the doctors?

expectations of the covered employee?

3

Is that the beginning point, the legitimate

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think it would be a mistake to

4

hinge ERISA scope on the subjective intent of the patient

5

under these circumstances.

6

QUESTION:

Reasonable legitimate expectations.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, even that I think is

8

probably a mistake, because the question -- the question

9

is, you know, you're in a fiduciary world when you're

10

administering a plan, and the question is -- and then you

11

have -- because then you have a whole series of questions,

2

is there a breach of fiduciary duty, and what the remedy

3

for it is, and what I'm suggesting is, I don't think the

4

Court wants to get into the business of saying that this

5

is, in fact, a fiduciary relationship based on ERISA.

6

It's certainly a physician-patient fiduciary

7

responsibility.

8

QUESTION:

But how do we get out of -- I mean,

9

the statute says that a fiduciary is a person under ERISA.

20

An ERISA fiduciary is a person who exercises discretionary

21

authority or control respecting management of a plan who

22

has any discretionary authority or responsibility in the

23

plan's administration.

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

QUESTION:

That's what the statute says.
Right.

Then what they've alleged -- whether

1

it's true or not, they've alleged it.

They say that these

2

people here, the HMO, have been given by contract the

3

authority to administer disputed claims.

4

they've been given by contract the authority to decide, am

5

I covered by the policy that my employer bought, or am I

6

not, and in particular they say that's true of emergency

7

treatment, that's true as to whether something is -- is it

8

routine, is it experimental, which plans are covered,

9

which claims are covered, which are not.

I take it that

Now, that's their allegation, so how in your

10
11

view is that not administering the discretionary

12

administration of the employer purchase plan itself?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, there are two answers to

4

that, Justice Breyer.

5

this is within the -- an employer welfare benefit plan, in

6

which case none of this is subject to any kinds of ERISA

7

requirements, but the second, and I think the more pointed

8

answer to that really comes to the question of what has

9

she in fact alleged, and can you read the complaint

20

potentially to embrace what you've described -QUESTION:

Under our broader theory none of

-- Justice Breyer, but the

24

question is, what does she mean by those particular words,

25

because all she's really doing there is alleging how the

1

plan operates and then using the statutory language.

2

But go back to page 9 of her brief, Justice

3

Breyer, and analyze exactly what it is that she says.

4

sole focus of that complaint, that entire count of that

5

complaint, is limited to the question of financial

6

incentives to deprive someone of particular medical

7

treatment.
That's what she's defended the judgment of the

8

9

The

Seventh Circuit reinstating her claim on, that's what's

10

before the Court, and I don't see why the Court should go

11

beyond that analysis in trying to resolve what otherwise

12

seems to me a very significant thicket that it would

13

other -- that it would have to address.
QUESTION:

14
15

So you say forget Roman numeral ii,

small ii, just focus on i.
MR. PHILLIPS:

respondent has asked you to read it.

to do any more than the respondent has pitched this

argument to you herself.

case.

There's no reason to start over.

But then you're making of this a

that she couldn't allege it.

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
It's our position that the treatment allegations

11
12

of the complaint, which regard the incentive to the

13

physicians, to the treating physicians concerning their

14

treatment of their patients, are governed -- essentially

State claims that are governed by State law but are not

ERISA's fiduciary duties with respect to those issues.
QUESTION:

2

It's also your position, I take it,

3

that not every claim of an error in the claim processing

4

function without more would state a breach of -- a claim

5

for breach of fiduciary duty?

6

MR. FELDMAN:

7

QUESTION:

That's true.

In other words, if they just get it

8

wrong, if a fiduciary just gets it wrong, that's not a

9

breach of fiduciary duty without something more.
MR. FELDMAN:

10

That's true, but insofar as the

11

fiduciary is someone -- it's an error that had to do with

12

the exercise of discretion under the plan in deciding

13

what -- whether a certain kind of procedure is covered,

14

then it would be a breach of fiduciary duty.

15

it makes that much difference, because if it's just an

16

error in construing the plan, the claimant would have a

17

claim under 502(a) for the benefit that was due in any

18

event.

administration of the plan?

3

MR. FELDMAN:

Why is that a discretionary

I think discretion in this sense

4

is used in the terms of applying the plan terms to a wide

5

variety, sometimes fairly vague plan terms to a wide

6

variety of different cases, and that does have something

7

in common with what judges do, and judges do exercise

8

discretion sometimes, but in the Varity Corporation v.

9

Howe, the Court said -- I'm reading from page 511, 516

10

U.S. on 511 -- a plan administrator engages in a fiduciary

11

act when making discretionary determination about whether

12

a claimant is entitled to benefits under the terms of the

13

plan documents.

14

So at some point there is a fiduciary, and --

15

who -- where that person has some discretion, is making a

16

judgment about applying some broad terms to maybe a

17

particular set of facts, or construing what the terms

18

mean, that person does become a fiduciary under ERISA.

19

Now, it's our position that a doctor doesn't

20

merely by accepting a patient and forming a doctor-patient

21

relationship.

22

has long been understood, the doctor's duties are governed

23

by principles of medical ethics and by State law, and

24

ERISA basically has nothing to do with that, whether it's

25

provided by an HMO or not.

Within a doctor-patient relationship, as it

and in this case that's

all that apparently happened, in fact, to the plaintiff,

but where there is a claim made, not -- which is generally

May I ask you a question?

The

definition of what fiduciary duty is, that they must

always discharge the duties solely in the interests of the

2

If you have an ambiguous plan

document, if its duty is to act solely in the interests of

the participant or the beneficiaries, it's a pretty tough

standard.

6

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I -- I don't think it's,

7

though -- I think the sense of, in the interests of the

8

participant or the beneficiary, what that means there is

9

to make determinations under -- as to what's covered and

10

what's not covered in accordance -- strictly in accordance

11

with the terms of the plan, not in accordance with other

12

considerations either for or against the particular

individual, because that beneficiary doesn't have the

right to anything, other than what the plan document's

entitles him or her to.

QUESTION:

What they're saying is that we think,

for example, if you have a group of people who look after

20

a child from the time it's born to the time it dies,

21

they'll get interested, through our incentives, in what's

22

called preventive care, and will end up with a lot less

23

disease.

24

Now, to do that, you have to have doctors who

Well, and I want to come back to

that question was, why does it make a difference that in

the owners, the sole owners of the HMO, and employ

themselves as the primary care physicians, aren't dealing

at arm's length.

QUESTION:

Mr. Ginzkey, I didn't get your

response to Justice Breyer's question about what

difference does it make whether there's separation or not.

6

Let's assume that doctors don't make the decisions, so you

have some other organization that makes the decisions.

keeping costs down, wouldn't that organization fall prey

that the claims administrators with a third party

MR. GINZKEY:

2

QUESTION:

3

And I'm trying to respond to that.

Would you respond a little more

directly?

4

MR. GINZKEY:

I think that there is a difference

5

between the scenario that you have suggested and a

6

scenario where the claims determiners are the ones who are

7

doing the determination of the actuarial underwriting so

8

that they know what's going to be in that risk pool at the

9

end of the year and, to the extent that they can deny

10

claims, there's more money in the risk pool for

11

distribution at year-end to them.
QUESTION:

12

Well, there's a difference perhaps in

13

degree.

14

but isn't -- at the end of the day, isn't the operative

15

fact that in any HMO the interest of the HMO and the

16

interest of every employee, whether -- of the HMO, whether

17

it be a doctor or a nondoctor administrator, is to hold

18

down health cost, because unless they do so the HMO is

going to go out of business?

There is a difference in the degree of finesse,

And it seems to me that that interest is there,

whether it is in the stark shape that it takes here, or

whether it's in a more subtle shape which it takes on your

don't see why the interest in the more subtle case isn't

2

equally at odds with fiduciary duty.

3

MR. GINZKEY:

It's the mechanism that we're

4

focusing on here, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION:

But why -- I know it is, but why does

6

the mechanism make a difference, because what you say is

7

wrong with the mechanism is that it induces these so-

8

called fiduciaries to say, no care for you, but that same

9

mechanism operating at a perhaps less obvious level is

10

inherent in any HMO, so I don't see why the mechanism

11

makes the difference.

12

MR. GINZKEY:

The mechanism makes the difference

13

here because these physicians in their capacity as owners

14

of this HMO are getting paid bonuses to deny care, and let

15

me explain that a little bit further.

16

Counsel indicates that on page 9 of our red

17

brief we took the position that the sole focus of

18

attention of amended Count III is the design and

19

administration of an undisclosed physician incentive to

20

withhold treatment.

21

That's taken out of context.

That entire paragraph on page 9 deals with cost

22

containments, and what we're saying is, we're only

focusing on one cost containment mechanism.

QUESTION:

In effect, the -- the rule of

6

decision that you want us to come down with I think is,

7

we've just got to draw lines here and say, the breach of

8

fiduciary duty is clear when the doctors get a year-end

9

payment and make the decision.

There is, however, no

10

breach of fiduciary duty, or at least not a cognizable

11

one, when the interest between denying coverage and

12

ultimate compensation is more subtle than that.

aren't you asking us for a rule of decision something like

what I just put to you?

MR. GINZKEY:

reference to incentives reaching the level of undue

influence so that it affects patient care.

10

that the rule that you want would outlaw the rule that I

14

MR. GINZKEY:

Because the rule that we're

suggesting here is not that broad, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I know, but what I -- see, my rule

15

draws its strength from the fact that we know there are a

16

group of ethical rules governing medicine, and doctors, we

17

believe, governed by this when they take the $3,300, will

18

try to look for the best way of saving the patient anyway,

19

and if they can do so with a little saving extra money,

20

that's to their benefit.

So that's why my rule sounded okay.

true, maybe it's not, but your role sounds as if it

abolishes my rule, so now, how -- why not?

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Ginzkey --

3

MR. GINZKEY:

4

QUESTION:

-- from ERISA.

-- why should the courts get into

5

this slippery slope problem that you're posing for us when

6

Congress has designed a scheme that's built on private

7

furnishing of health care through health maintenance

8

organizations that are privately owned, and where there

9

are inherently incentives to keep costs down at the HMO in

10
11

order to provide the care and make it pay for itself?
And that's the scheme Congress has authorized,

12

and they are served by doctors that have ethical

13

obligations in the treatment of patients, and I suppose

14

Congress relied on the ability of the enforcement of those

15

ethical obligations to curb what otherwise might appear to

16

be an unfortunate financial incentive to cut costs, and

I -- why should the courts get involved in this messy

18

business of deciding what scheme is an undue infringement

19

and what isn't?

20

MR. GINZKEY:

Let me respond firstly by saying

21

I'm only aware of one case where a Federal court

22

specifically addressed the issue of whether or not the

23

ethical opinions promulgated by the American Medical

24

Association are enough to counterbalance an incentive that

25

a doctor might have to cut care, and that decision I cited

1

in my -- I believe it was the reply at the writ stage, and

2

that court decided that the ethical opinions aren't enough

3

to counterbalance strong financial incentives, and

4

therefore we can't rely on the physicians' ethics in

5

situations like this.

6

But let me get also to the question that you

7

posed concerning why should you get involved.

This Court

8

in Varity v. Howe said that Congress, when it passed

9

ERISA, adopted the common law principles of trusts.

10

Congress didn't specify what the courts were supposed to

11

do in each and every case.

12

Congress said that the courts across this land

13

should look at pension benefit funds, or pension benefit

14

programs, or welfare, health care programs, applying the

15

law of trusts, and try to determine, using the principles

16

of equity under the law, common laws of trust, what is

17

acceptable and what's not acceptable.

That's correct.

To your client.
That's correct.

It was acknowledged that what she was

suffering from was covered by the plan, and what her

complaint was is that she got procedure A whereas she

should have had procedure B, which was more expensive, and

they didn't give her B because of the cost.

Why is that even involved in the case?
This is not a denial of benefits

So how do we get into the coverage determination

It's not a denial of coverage

That's not what we're alleging.

QUESTION:

Okay.

MR. GINZKEY:

The benefits, or excuse me, the

20

expenses that were incurred for her hospitalization and

21

emergency surgery were paid in full.

recover those.

QUESTION:

We're not seeking to

You say she should have had some

other kind of treatment, which would have been more

than it otherwise would be?

What exactly is the

The harm is simply that the risk pool is smaller

MR. GINZKEY:

In

The harm is that the money that is

So you're basically making a

And you asked what the harm is.

What strikes me

21

about this case, unusual about this case is that the

22

courts zealously protect money for money's sake with

23

respect to pension plans, and let me explain that.

24

look at the John Hancock v. Harris Trust case that this

Assuming, and you know your case, this is a

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- am I right that in order for you,

11

which I think we've all been assuming, am I right that in

12

order for you to make out your case that there has been

13

mismanagement of funds, it's necessary for us to accept

14

the proposition that whenever a physician in an HMO has a

15

strong financial incentive to make a medical decision,

16

that that medical decision is therefore a fiduciary

17

decision, and is therefore -- and therefore a claim

18

against him is preempted from State malpractice law in

19

favor of ERISA fiduciary law?

MR. GINZKEY:

No, you do not make that

QUESTION:

Then it's not the median term.

isn't it the median term in order to get your result?
MR. GINZKEY:

We're confusing a couple of two

different issues, because there's more than one level

determination by the primary care physicians as to what is

6

plan, it's also a coverage decision, so -QUESTION:

MR. GINZKEY:
QUESTION:

That not only is a

And that kind of decision was

8

10

One of the lower levels that is

But we're not --

Isn't it?

I mean, isn't that your

11

understanding of what you're claiming, that that kind of

12

decision was crucial to your claim in this case?
MR. GINZKEY:

3

No, because there was nothing that

4

the physician felt that was medically necessary that was

5

denied.
QUESTION:

6

Are you saying that it just happens

7

to be a coincidence that you are bringing this financial

mismanagement claim under the same -- with the -- joined

with the same pleadings that happen to make malpractice

claims?

21

client had lived a totally healthy life and never been

22

denied an immediate appendectomy, that you could bring

23

this claim, and it's a mere coincidence that you happen to

Are you saying that out of the blue, even if your

MR. GINZKEY:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct, because --

I didn't realize -Because --

I didn't realize you were making any

6

ERISA claim.

I thought you were making State claims, and

7

the reason all of this comes up is that the objection to

8

your Count III and Count IV State claims was that they

9

were preempted by ERISA.

10

MR. GINZKEY:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GINZKEY:

No.

We're making an ERISA claim.

Where does that appear in your -It's amended Count III.

That's in

13

the joint appendix.

14

QUESTION:

Amended Count III.

15

QUESTION:

So we've actually -- now, your

16

client's appendectomy is irrelevant, the malpractice is

17

irrelevant, has nothing to do with it, it's entirely --

18

which is -- I mean, and then it's going to come down to

19

either the fiduciary issue, or if you are fiduciaries, we

20

have to figure out what the standard is on what incentives

21

could be so extreme that they violate the obligation to

22

everybody.

Is that basically where we are?

23

MR. GINZKEY:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's exactly right, Judge.

And what in your view is the standard

for determining whether -- because you concede that some

incentive plans could be okay, so what's the standard for

2

determining -- and I think the Government concedes that

3

there could be some that weren't okay.

And I agree.

All right.

I know.

I agree.

So now we've got a lot of agreement

here, and what we've got to -(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

What, in your view, is the difference

11

in the standard, then, as to when they're okay when

12

they're not okay?

13

MR. GINZKEY:

That's going to be a difficult

14

line to draw.

It's kind of like the line that the Court's

15

going to have to draw with respect to the Webster Hubbell

16

case that was argued yesterday.

17

difficult line to draw, but the fact that it's difficult

18

to draw doesn't mean we don't draw it.

19

QUESTION:

All right.

20

MR. GINZKEY:

It's going to be a

How would you draw it?

The phrase that I have used is

21

undue influence, because again, drawing on the study from

22

California, the median incentive was $10,400, but some of

23

those incentives got up to $40-$50,000.

24
25

If I'm a physician, and I have a $100,000 annual
salary by contract, and I've got two kids in college, and

I can make another $50,000, that's a lot of incentive.

That's an improper -- that's an undue influence.

an improper incentive.
