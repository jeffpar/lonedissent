CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 99-830, Don Stenberg v. Leroy Carhart.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. STENBERG

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
GENERAL STENBERG:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Roe v. Wade, this Court said that there is no

10
11

absolute right to terminate a pregnancy at whatever time,

12

in whatever way, and for whatever reason a woman chooses.

13

With that legal principle, and the Casey undue burden test

14

in mind, the issue here today is whether a State may

15

prohibit a little-used form of abortion that borders on

16

infanticide when safe, alternative forms of abortion

17

remain available to women who seek abortions.

18

Clearly, the State can constitutionally ban some

19

abortion procedures.

20

unquestionably prohibit an abortion procedure that is
%.
unsafe for the woman's health.

21
22

QUESTION:

For example, the State can

General Stenberg, I just would like

23

to,Clarify one thing.

24

thought that this case related only to pre-viability.

25

that not so?

You say, borders on infanticide.

GENERAL STENBERG:

1

Well, that -- the statute

would cover both pre-viability and post viability, Your

3

Honor, but I believe it was the legislature's observation

that, whether viable or not, that it's important --

t

5

QUESTION:

This case concerns only the pre-

6

viable stage, is that not so?
GENERAL STENBERG:

7

Yes.

That's because the

8

district judge -- because Dr. Carhart testified that he

9

did not perform post viability partial birth abortions,

10

and therefore the Federal judge did not need to rule on

11

the post-viability aspect of the statute.

12

The statute itself covers --

QUESTION:

I take it -Covers both, Your Honor.

I take it that save with respect to

a -- an exception to save the woman's life, and so on,

17

that post viability abortions are generally precluded, by

18

the State.

GENERAL STENBERG:

QUESTION:

21

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

Post viability abortions are

generally prohibited, I assume, by separate statute.

GENERAL STENBERG:

Yes.

There is a separate

statute that prohibits all post viability abortions except

24

to save the life or for the health of the mother.

under* another statute.

That is

But I believe, Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg,
that the State interest here is drawing a bright line
between infanticide and abortion, and that's such a strong
State interest that 30 States in our Nation have addressed
this issue and have voted to ban that procedure.

In fact,

in Nebraska the sentiment was so strong on the State
interest to draw a bright line between infanticide -QUESTION:

But General, isn't the bright line

between infanticide and abortion at the -- a claim of
viability?

Isn't that the statute that draws that bright

line?
GENERAL STENBERG:
QUESTION:

I think that 30 States --

It does draw that bright line,

doesn't it?
GENERAL STENBERG:

Well, that would be a line.

That's not the bright line, however, that the legislature
drew in this instance, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

No, but that is a bright line that

separates post viability from pre-viability abortions,
since one is legal and the other is illegal, under
Nebraska law?
Jv

GENERAL STENBERG:

Well, that is under one

Nebraska statute, that's correct, Your Honor, but the
legislature has also been concerned about the partial

General Stenberg, I took it that what

nothing to do with the viability of the fetus, but that

the procedure looks more like infanticide --

GENERAL STENBERG:

and

Is that

That is precisely the point,

13

Your Honor, and that is precisely what motivated the

14

legislature of the State of Nebraska in this case.

15

In fact, the State interest here was so strong

16

that the statute passed the Nebraska legislature with only

17

one dissenting vote, with many pro-choice State

18

legislators voting in favor of this ban on partial birth

furthering this interest in potential life or some other

there could be other State interests besides merely

maternal health and discouraging abortions.
Now, the respondent next argues that even if

there is a valid State interest, that it can only be

asserted if it creates no burden on a woman's right to

have an abortion.

The respondent also asks this Court to in fact

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

Am I correct that the injunction only

GENERAL STENBERG:

And similarly situated

individuals, is the way I believe the court's order read,
Your Honor.
QUESTION:

How did the court of appeals -- did

the court of appeals say whether it was treating this as a
facial challenge, or an as-applied challenge?
GENERAL STENBERG:

It seems -- my reading of the

circuit court was that they viewed it as an applied -- or,
excuse me, as a facial challenge.

I think what the

district judge may have thought when he said, as applied,
he may have meant as applied to pre-viability abortions,
drawing the distinction that Dr. Carhart testified that he
doesn't do post viability abortions.
QUESTION:

Mr. Steinberg, do you take the

position that the State of Nebraska could also prohibit

For purposes of this case,

2

the State's position would be that the State could not

prohibit the D&E procedure, but also the State has not

4

attempted to prohibit the D&E procedure.
QUESTION:

5

I know that's the position you take,

but it is difficult to read the statute and be certain

that that is so.

QUESTION:

I think --

-- and I'm not certain whether the

statute might not prohibit the D&E procedure as well.

GENERAL STENBERG:

It's our position, Your

Honor, that it does not prohibit the D&E procedure, and

14

I'd like to address that question first from a, kind of an

15

institutional standpoint and then turn specifically to the

language of the statute.
In the absence $f a decision interpreting this

authority on the proper interpretation of State law is the

A U.S. district court, by comparison, spends

QUESTION:

Does the Attorney General in the

State of Nebraska issue rulings or opinion letters?

6

GENERAL STENBERG:

7

not have the opportunity to do that.

8

while this statute was in the legislative process, to

9

issue an interpretation.

10

We do, Your Honor.

We did

We were not asked,

But the point I want to make here is that there

11

are approximately 20 of these cases in various stages in

12

various Federal courts throughout the Nation and, at least

13

so far as my staff can determine, no State Attorney

14

General has interpreted this law or similar laws in their

15

own States to ban the D&E procedure.

16

QUESTION:

General Stenberg, one of the

17

authorities that you citefl for deference was the

18
19

Arizonan's case where there was a formal opinion of the
>*
State Attorney General, and yet when that case was

20

ultimately decided by the State's own supreme court, the

21

Arizona supreme court, they rejected the formal opinion of

22

the State Attorney General, so I think you can say that
rfj

you .'deserve respectful consideration, but no more than

that.

litigation.
GENERAL STENBERG:

2

Well, I understand that, Your

3

Honor.

I guess my point is, is that for the Court to do

4

that, this Court would have to essentially tell the

5

Attorneys General of approximately 20 States that each and

6

every one of them misunderstood and misinterpreted their

7

own State law, even though that is their principal

8

business day-in and day-out, year-in and year-out.
QUESTION:

9

Well, outside of this litigation, has

10

your office or the Attorney General's office in Nebraska

11

taken a formal position that this statute does not apply

12

to the D&E procedure?
GENERAL STENBERG:

13

Well, our formal position was
*

14

taken in the context of this litigation, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

15

Of this litigation, but not -- in no

16

other form and in no other venue have you made that

statement or that representation?

2

that procedure is available to -QUESTION:

3

Was there no testimony to the effect

4

that there might be circumstances in which the health of

5

the woman required D&X versus D&E?
GENERAL STENBERG:

6

There was -- there was

7

testimony that I would regard as speculation, Your Honor,

8

but both the American Medical Association and the American

9

College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have studied

10

this issue and said that they could not identify a single

11

circumstance when a -- in which a partial birth abortion,

12

or a D&X abortion would be the only procedure available to

13

save the life --

14

QUESTION:

Then why did you need an exception

15

for life, because if you say the D&X procedure is never

16

medically necessary, then what you're saying about no need

17

for a health exception would seem to apply as well to a

18

life exception.

19

f

GENERAL STENBERG:

I think from a legal

20

standpoint it does apply.

21

as legislative bodies do, as part of a political

22

compromise, as part of a, perhaps an effort to be

23

particularly careful when the life of the woman was

involved, but I don't believe that it would have been

25

necessary in order to have a constitutional statute.

QUESTION:
not a doctor,

If I read these correctly, and I'm

it seems to me a lot of the amici on the

other side representing medical organizations say that
there could be circumstances where this D&E procedure is
more risky for the health of the woman.
For example, hurting the womb so perhaps the
woman couldn't have children in the future, and there are
a whole lot of circumstances where labor-induced
abortion -- you know, induced labor can be more dangerous.
At least they list quite a few.

So what are we supposed

to do where the medical opinion seems at least divided?
GENERAL STENBERG:

Oh,

I think the medical

opinion is divided, Your Honor, and I think what this
Court should do when the medical opinion ,is divided is
defer to the judgment of the State legislative body, which
is the proper fact-finder when we're dealing with -QUESTION:

1

Dr. Carhart here,

that of the 60 or so doctors who have

2

testified in these partial-birth abortion cases all across

3

the country, only about three could be identified as

4

actually performing this procedure themselves.

5

think that we can conclude, as a legislative policy

6

matter, that there are only -- that almost 60 of these

7

doctors are not properly caring, or significantly creating

8

a health risk for their women who are patients.

I don't

This is a practice that is not used even by most

9
10

abortionists in the United States, and so it's very

11

difficult to conclude that there is any health risk when

12

both ACOG and the American Medical Association

13

specifically'found that there are always alternatives

14

available to a woman in need of abortion if there is a

15

health concern.
But to return briefly to the overall picture of

16
17

statutory construction,

18

this Court adopt the corollary proposed m the Friend of

19

the Court brief authored*by the State of Virginia, which

20

basically says that when a Federal court is faced with a

21

State statute that has not been construed by the State's

22

highest court, that the Federal court either defer to the

23

opinion of the. Attorney General or -- of the State, or,

I would strongly recommend that

the Court is unwilling, or finds that that would not be a

correct interpretation of the law, to certify the question

We did ask the court in our answer to the

complaint to abstain so that the State courts could hear

QUESTION:

If you didn't suggest it at the

GENERAL STENBERG:

No, Your Honor, we did not.

There was a conversation -QUESTION:

differences between Arizonans and this case, is they had

GENERAL STENBERG:

1

Not to my knowledge.

There

2

was a discussion, Your Honor, in closing arguments between

3

Mr. Heller, counsel for Dr. Carhart, and the district

4

judge, closing arguments on the preliminary injunction,

5

and Judge Kopf brought up the issue of certification, and

6

Mr. Heller did not strongly object, but his argument was

7

that that would not resolve the controversy, that even if

and then the question is whether, could the State ban just
D&X, and I understood you to say earlier that the American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said you don't
need this procedure in substance.
But I notice in their brief they have a
sentence, depending on the physician's skill and
experience, the D&X procedure can be the most appropriate
abortion procedure for some women in some circumstances,

I don't believe so, Your

Dr. Carhart testified that he attempts

approximately 200 D&X abortions a year, but only
y'

successfully completes 10 or 20 of them, and a procedure
that is completed so rarely, and that is practiced so
rarely across the United States, even by persons in the
practice of abortion, simply prohibiting that procedure
can simply not be considered to present any significant
threat to a woman's health if that procedure's not
available.
QUESTION:

Well, but I mean, you could make the

same argument about the exception to save life.

There are

very rarely instances, probably, in the whole spectrum of
abortion practice in which the life exception is
necessary, but you can't thereby simply say, well, we're
going to allow the legislature to ignore those cases and
eliminate a life exception even in your later term
prohibition, so why, I guess, should the legislature be
more cavalier in Overruling medical judgment in this
circumstance?
GENERAL STENBERG:

Well, I think the

overwhelming weight of medical judgment, as opposed to the
district court judge's view, comes from the American
Medical Association and ACOG that this particular

QUESTION:

2

Well, I think when we're talking

3

about most appropriate procedure, as Justice Stevens is

4

quoting their brief as doing, I think normally we take --

5

at least I take that to mean the procedure which is most

6

conducive to an uncomplicated abortion and hence one that

7

does not present any health risks that can be avoided, so

8

I find your assumption hard to accept if we are entitled

9

to take into consideration the position stated in the OB-

GENERAL STENBERG:

Well, under Casey, Your

12

Honor, if the test were a no-burden test, or if there

13

could be not even the smallest possible health

14

consideration, then Casey would have come Out differently

15

on the 24-hour waiting period.

Casey indicated that there were two interests throughout

other is the potential life of the fetus.

22

And whatever this particular ban does, it

certainly can't be urged that it is passed in the

So it doesn't serve either of the purposes that

be out of the balance that this Court set for legitimate

GENERAL STENBERG:

to be recognized and defined in subsequent case law, and I

the legislature had simply said, we ban D&X and not D&E.
And to me it's -- it's -- that's just glaring here that
they could have reduced all question of ambiguity if they
had simply said we ban a term that the doctors call D&X
and we don't ban D&E.

Is there any explanation why they

didn't simply say if they meant to cut out D&X, D&X is
banned?
MR. HELLER:

Well, there is.

First, they --

they rejected an amendment that would have done just that.
Secondly, throughout the legislative history,
it's apparent that what they wanted to do was prohibit the
D&X technique, but also to prohibit many other forms of
abortion in which the living fetus was brought into the
vagina before demise was caused.

That was their

intention.

QUESTION:

Certainly it depends upon how

whatever in -- in the State in -- in preventing the

those in attendance and those who know what goes on
witnessing the -- the destruction of a -- of a live human

There's no State interest in

that at all?

MR. HELLER:

QUESTION:

Roe -- Roe -- neither Roe nor Casey

They may not have

Why is it not an

rendering society callous to infanticide?
There were very many highly civilized societies,
including the Ancient Greeks, who permitted infanticide,
who said that the right of parents included the right not
to be burdened with a child they didn't want, especially a
deformed child.

And therefore, in order to prevent other

societies descending into that degree of callousness, the
-- the numerous States that have enacted’• these laws -- I
don't think it's so much a concern with -- with medical
matters.

There's certainly a valid State

And of

4

already does so through its general homicide statutes, so

that Nebraska protects the fetus, even the pre-viable

For example, again, if -- if the State -- if the

So, when this Court, for example, in Danforth

struck down the -- Missouri's prohibition on saline

abortions, it took a step that enabled physicians to

continue to develop newer, safer methods of abortion.
■

That really relates to one of the points made by

14

Mr. Stenberg in his opening, which is that, well, why

aren't all these other physicians around the country doing

QUESTION:
General Stenberg?

Why didn't they just say that,
Why didn't they just -- I mean, that

was proposed, Mr. Heller told us -- say that what's banned
is D&X, what's not banned is D&E?
way of clarifying it.

That was such a simple

Why didn't they do that?

MR. STENBERG:

Because the Nebraska legislature

was relying on the American Medical Association and the
Congress of the United States and patterned their
legislation on that.

And they felt that if this gained

the support of the American Medical Association and
Congress, which it did for the 1997 law, that they wanted
to pahtern that and rely on the American Medical
Association and their lawyers and congressional lawyers.
QUESTION:

Did the medical -- American Medical

Association recommend this text or did they simply say, in

l

our judgment, it's okay/to ban D&X?

They did -- they did both.
