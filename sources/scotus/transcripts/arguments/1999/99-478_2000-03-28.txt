CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH D. O'NEILL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. O'NEILL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is about the erosion of the jury by

12

the New Jersey legislature.

13

case violates the Fourteenth and Sixth Amendments by

14

permitting the judge to consider or assess a defendant's

15

mental state by a preponderance of the evidence and

16

sentence that person to a term of up to double the time

17

permitted upon conviction of the predicate crime.

18

The statute at issue in this

Here, petitioner pled guilty to three crimes,

19

but was sentenced on four.

In Jones v. the United States,

20

this Court constructed a proposed test for

21

constitutionality of the statute as to determine whether

22

the statue creates a separate element of a crime or a

23

sentencing factor.

24

which increases the maximum sentence, implicates

25

constitutional protections of beyond a reasonable doubt,

Any fact, other than prior conviction,

notice by -QUESTION:

Well, what do you do with the capital

3

sentencing schemes in a State like Arizona, for example,

4

where a person can be convicted of first degree murder and

5

then the judge does the sentencing and is allowed to

6

increase the sentence to a death penalty, set it at death,

7

if it was done for, let's say, pecuniary gain, some factor

8

that the judge determines, and this Court has upheld that

9

kind of a scheme.

10
11
12

Now, under your theory that, too, would be
invalid if we were to accept what you've just been saying.
MR. O'NEILL:

I suggest not, Justice O'Connor,

13

because my understanding of the statutes extant is that

14

they -- some of them provide for the death penalty, but

15

that's the maximum, so in States such as those -- I'm not

16

intimately familiar with Arizona, but it is the States

17

with which I am familiar, those penalties would be within

18

the maximum and call for proof beyond a reasonable doubt

19

to a jury before the judge sentences.

20

QUESTION:

But in Arizona the jury simply finds

21

a person guilty of first degree murder and leaves the

22

option of life imprisonment, or death, to the judge, so

23

that clearly the judge is imposing a sentence that was

24

perhaps within the range the jury -- but it could just as

25

easily have been life.

MR. O'NEILL:

1

I agree with that, Mr. Chief

2

Justice.

3

by the statute that the jury knew about, presumably,

4

before they found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable

5

doubt.

6

However, again, it's within the maximum provided

QUESTION:

The jury is told and instructed,

7

don't consider the sentence.

8

up to the judge.

9

whether this person convicted -- should be convicted of

10
11

That's not your job.

Don't consider that.

It's

You just determine

first degree murder.
MR. O'NEILL:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

However,

12

it's my understanding that a statute does provide for not

13

only life, of course, but also, as you point out, death,

14

but within the maximum sentence.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. O'Neill, of course, until our

16

death penalty cases in the 1960's, had not the traditional

17

practice been that a judge in a case where the sentence

18

was up to and including death had the discretion to impose

19

the death penalty or not, or the jury had the discretion

20

to impose it or not?

21

MR. O'NEILL:

22

QUESTION:

23

Justice Scalia --

Wasn't that the traditional rule

against which the Sixth Amendment was adopted?

24

MR. O'NEILL:

25

QUESTION:

It is, sir.

And it was our jurisprudence that

1

created the new factor that you could not impose the death

2

penalty unless there were some special facts which had to

3

be found, either by the judge or by the jury, that would

4

justify it, so this is all a creation of this Court.

5

has nothing to do with what the Sixth Amendment meant when

6

it was adopted, does it?

7

MR. O'NEILL:

8

QUESTION:

9

I agree with that, Justice Scalia.

Maybe I can get at the same question

that Justice O'Connor and the Chief Justice had in a

10

slightly different way.

11

as Member of Congress, I tell you the following.

12

my drafter.

13

It

Imagine that I'm in Congress and,

I say, here's what I'd like to do.

You're

I'd like to

14

write this criminal statute for bank robbery so that the

15

sentencing works as follows, so that where the gun is

16

loaded, there's a higher sentence.

17

loaded, there's a lower sentence.

18

sentencing to work.

19

Where the gun isn't
That's how I want the

The crime is bank robbery, but I want these

20

judges to be pretty uniform, and I want them all to

21

give -- you know, they have a bigger range where the

22

gun's -- you see, where the gun is loaded, and a lower

23

range where it's not loaded.

24

How do I draft it?

25

MR. O'NEILL:

Can I do it?

Justice Breyer, yes, that would

constitutional so long as --

How do I draft it?

say?

yearsif the gun isn't loaded, but up

loaded.

What do the words

Let's imagine, you know, I want them to have up to 3

MR. O'NEILL:

6

to 5 years if it is

The sentence -- the drafting goes

7

something like this, in crude language, that the maximum

8

penalty for commission of such-and-such crime is 5 years.

9

However, if he then is convicted only of such-and-such, it

10

is a maximum of 3 years.
QUESTION:

11

All

right.

Then if I can do that,

12

then what will happen if

13

to happen is that Congress goes back, redrafts all the

14

drug laws, and in the meantime I guess we have new trials

15

of everybody who's been convicted, but they just -- it's

16

just a drafting matter, is that right, that all they have

17

to do is write the same thing, but instead of saying the

18

thing goes from 3 to 5 years, 3-year max unloaded and 5-

19

year max loaded, what they do is, they write 5-year max,

20

period, but no more than 3 if it's unloaded.

drafting.

22

you win this case is all that has

It's just

Is that what it is?
MR. O'NEILL:

Well, Justice Breyer, I think that

23

Winship spoke in terms of formalism but prescribed against

24

that, so --

25

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Are you saying that in

1

that case, with that kind of a statute, you would concede

2

that in order to get 5 years, in order to impose 5 years,

3

you would not need a jury finding that the gun was loaded?

4

7

MR. O'NEILL:

No, I would not concede that,

Justice Scalia. I would concede only -QUESTION:

But that's the premise of the

question, I thought.

8

QUESTION:

Yes, it is.

9

MR. O'NEILL:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. O'NEILL:

Well then, I would --

I didn't think you were -I would say only, Justice Scalia

12

and Justice Breyer, that there would have to be the

13

constitutional protections of proof beyond a reasonable

14

doubt as to a jury.

15

QUESTION:

16

Okay, so what you're saying is, I

can't -- if I'm Congress, I can't --

MR. O'NEILL:

QUESTION:

19

MR. O'NEILL:

20

QUESTION:

21

22

You can't, under those --

Fine.
-- prescribed circumstances.

Fine.

If I can't, my question would

be, why not?
MR. O'NEILL:

Because the constitutional

23

safeguards of beyond a reasonable doubt, and to a jury,

24

are paramount.

25

QUESTION:

I've got that point.

Now my -- I'm

1

trying to get you down a little line of questioning here,

2

and then I'd say if that's true, then I guess exactly the

3

same thing is true of the Sentencing Commission does the

4

3-5 year business, and again I'd say exactly the same is

5

true if a judge does it, which brings us back to Justice

6

O' Connor.

7

Now, how -- I mean, on that line that you've

8

just taken, if I agree with you, I guess I'm holding the

9

Sentencing Commission unconstitutional and, indeed, I

10

guess I'm holding as well unconstitutional the situation

11

where a judge says, defendant, I've looked at the

12

presentence report.

13

dispute it, but if the gun is loaded, 5 years.

14

isn't, three.

15

You can

If it

So you have three situations, judge, Sentencing

16

Commission, Congress.

17

cannot do it.

18

It says your gun was loaded.

You've said Congress can do it --

Can the commission?

MR. O'NEILL:

Can a judge?

Well, Justice Breyer, in response

19

to that question,

20

analogy in the Federal statutes in reference to drug --

21

drugs as to quantity and quality.

22

I would say this.

If I can use the

Now, I have a fallback position, and that is

23

this, that if the test were something like this, if the

24

maximum sentence is increased and there is required an

25

assessment of the mental state of the defendant, then I

1

think the quality and quantity problems with the drug

2

statute would not be affected.

3

Justice Breyer, that the Federal sentencing guidelines

4

would not be impacted by the proposed standard, proposed

5

by this Court in Jones.

6

QUESTION:

I respectfully suggest,

Mr. O'Neill, I assume you're saying

7

that as long as it's within the upper range that is

8

specified by the legislature, but if you will, instead of

9

engaging in things that you may be less familiar with,

10

let's look at the very statute that you're dealing with,

11

and there are seven factors that would lead to this

12

doubling of the penalty, and the racial/gender animus is

13

just one of them.

14

In that list of seven, which ones are not

15

encompassed within your constitutional objection?

16

one -- even if you won this case, which one, if any, could

17

remain as the New Jersey legislature set it up?

18
19

MR. O'NEILL:

QUESTION:

21

MR. O'NEILL:

22

QUESTION:

24
25

Justice Ginsburg, I would say that

the way it's set up, all of them would remain.

20

23

Which

Well, not this one.
Not this one.

Wait, I don't understand.

All of

them -- they're all valid except this one?
MR. O'NEILL:

Well, if we're saying in terms of

the question, Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia, that if

1

we're talking about race, color, gender, handicap,

2

religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, then I think

3

all of them require the same constitutional guidelines.

4

QUESTION:

Well then, but what about another one

5

that operates in the same way, is used or was in

6

possession of a stolen motor vehicle?

7

by the judge on a preponderance, not beyond a reasonable

8

doubt, and yield for the defendant the same thing.

9

MR. O'NEILL:

That would be found

If there's a presumption that the

10

underlying crime was found to be violated by the defendant

11

beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury, yes, because it would

12

be within the maximum sentence.

13

QUESTION:

I don't understand that.

14

understand your answer.

a reasonable doubt that a car was used?

MR. O'NEILL:

QUESTION:

I don't

Would a jury have to find beyond

Yes, Justice Scalia.

But not under the statute.

The

18

statute sets it up the jury finds assault or whatever is

19

the underlying crime, and then the judge, under subsection

20

(f), the one immediately following subsection (e), your

21

subsection, the judge is instructed that if this crime,

22

this assault was committed and the defendant was at the

23

time in possession of a stolen motor vehicle, then we get

24

kicked up from 5 to 10, to 10 to 20.

25

So I'm asking you to concentrate on the very

next section of the same statute and tell me,

2

you said there was a distinction between the two, and I

3

don't understand why the one would have to go to the jury

4

and the other would not.
MR. O'NEILL:

5

you said --

Well, perhaps I didn't state my

6

position clearly enough.

7

Ginsburg, that whenever there is a question of fact which

8

raises the maximum sentence the defendant faces, that

9

requires a constitutional safeguards of beyond a

My position is this, Justice

10

reasonable doubt, and prove to a jury, as well as fair

11

notice.
QUESTION:

12

Well, suppose that the question of

13

fact is whether the defendant used or was in possession of

14

a stolen motor vehicle?
MR. O'NEILL:

15
16

I would say that it's a fact

that's a jury question.
QUESTION:

17

Well, what about McMillan v.

18

Pennsylvania, where you're talking about crime done with

19

possession of a gun?
MR. O'NEILL:

20

Well, that's a question, Chief

21

Justice, that's easily ascertainable as it is the issue of

22

prior conviction, Almendarez-Torres.
QUESTION:

23

Well, and wouldn't possession of a

motor vehicle, a stolen motor --be equally easily found

MR. O'NEILL:

Most respectfully, Chief Justice,

2

I don't think so.

I think the issue as to whether

3

possession of a stolen motor vehicle occurred or not is

4

subject to some variables to which the possession of a

firearm for an unlawful purpose is not.

Of course, how would that example

If life is within the maximum

sentence, no, there's nothing wrong with it.

7

QUESTION:

Okay.

Now, suppose the legislature

8

specifies that if torment is called -- is caused, it would

be life, and if not, 20 years, then there's a

QUESTION:

I think so. I think the jury --

But then you can't say, as you did at

the outset, that Congress is eroding the jury sentencing.

14

It seems hard to erode the jury sentencing when all

15

Congress has done is provide some -- or the legislature

16

has done is to provide some guidance to its judgment --

17

judges in sentencing.

18

MR. O'NEILL:

Well, it seems to me that the

19

statute at issue does violate the Fourteenth and Sixth

20

Amendments because, by a mere preponderance of the

21

evidence, and I suggest it should be by proof beyond a

22

reasonable doubt, it permits a defendant to assess a

23

mental state of the defendant and submit that person to a

24

sentence of up to double that required in the predicate

25

crime.

It's up to the judge.

If he wants to

MR. O'NEILL:

You see, that's what's actually-

QUESTION:

So I suppose that means that the New

3

Jersey legislature could provide for first degree murder

is murder with malice aforethought, and could provide the

judge to decide whether there was malice aforethought, and

to decide that just by a preponderance of the evidence?
MS. GOCHMAN:

Respectfully, malice aforethought

is not the same as motive.

Malice aforethought is that

10

yes, you intended to commit this crime, but even with

11

malice aforethought, the prosecution does not need to

owed him money, because he made some sort of unwarranted

advances.

In this Court's opinion in

permissible.

10

It sure did, and the Court also

emphasized about a half-a-dozen times that recidivism was

And within that range, it was not uncommon for

judges to consider such things as the motive of the crime,

or the lack of remorse, if that was the case, by the

defendant, or, if you had a defendant that just appeared

to be absolutely without remorse, and intending to create

Now, we all agree, I think, that a legislature

normally may define the elements of a crime and fix the

minimum and maximum punishments for that crime.

legislature does in these cases is to make a subsidiary

offense subject to a fine, but then said, if the judge

finds that you were double-parked because you were going

to escape from a bank robbery, then it's life

imprisonment, we think that would be so contrary to our

traditions and so obviously abusive, that it would be on

the other side of the line.

MR. DuMONT:

1

We think tradition and common

2

practice are helpful guides in looking at a particular

3

statute, but no, they don't define a particular line.

4

guess I would have two answers to the question of what is

5

the line.

6

I

At the furthest doctrinal level, I think that

7

the best answer I can give you is that if the Court

8

becomes convinced beyond, if I may use the phrase, a

9

constitutional doubt, that a legislature is punishing a

10

defendant for something other than the crime described by

11

the elements of the crime of which he was convicted, then

12

there is reason for grave concern, and possibly that

13

statute is unconstitutional.

14

But it must be remembered that a legislature has

15

wide right to define crimes and to punish them very

16

severely, so the question to be asked, to take Justice

17

Scalia's hypothetical, for instance, from his dissent in

18

Monge, of the statute that says, any intentional causing

19

of harm is a crime, and everything else is a sentencing

20

factor, you have to start with the supposition that the

21

legislature could not enact that offense just as a crime

22

and then say, it is a crime, and the sentence is up to

23

life imprisonment or death in appropriate cases, and the

24

judge decides.

25

Now, if that is constitutionally problematic,

which we think it probably would be, it's probably the

2

same constitutional problem that we can see here.

3

QUESTION:

Do you think it's a problem for a

4

legislature to say robbery is punishable by anything from

5

a year to life?

6

MR. DuMONT:

No.

No, not at all.

My point is

7

only that at some extreme there may be a due process or a

8

jury trial when the --on even just imposing a crime and

9

10

Now - -

QUESTION:

How about a narrower example?

12

Instead of saying, all wrongdoing, let's say all theft.

13

All theft is punishable from zero to life.

14
15
16

MR. DuMONT:

On its face, the statute is

constitutional.
QUESTION:

Then you basically, in the real

17

world, are saying the legislature is going to determine

18

when there is a jury right and when there isn't.

19

I don't see how you can escape that conclusion.

20

MR. DuMONT:

I mean,

I think that's correct, and I think

21

that's the way it's always been except for common law

22

crimes, and common law crimes were crimes that were

23

defined by courts, and they were always understood to be

24

at the pleasure of the legislature if the legislature

25

chose to make a different disposition.

5

Why do you say that's the way it's

I don't understand what you mean by that.

MR. DuMONT:

I

Well, take the Federal system.

6

Congress is the only body that can define a crime, so if

7

you don't have a congressional enactment, you don't have a

8

statute, you don't know what the elements are and, in

9

fact, there are no elements.

There is no crime.

So, of

10

course, whether you get a jury trial right always depends

11

on what the legislature has defined to be a crime.

12

Now, if I can just address for a moment the

13

Jones rule, because I think -- we have two points to make

14

about the proposed Jones rule.

15

out a lot of legislative conduct that to us is perfectly

16

legitimate and even laudable, and if you take the

17

traditional robbery, or, say, a kidnapping statute that

18

says -- the Federal one says zero to death, actually, and

19

that's what the statute says now.

20

One is that it would cut

Suppose Congress says, well, we'd like to bring

21

a little more order to the sentencing process, so we think

22

it's going to be presumptively 25 years, but if a child is

23

involved, or there was bodily injury, then it's going to

24

be 25 to 40, and if someone was killed, if the victim was

25

killed, then it ought to be from 40 to life.

Now, you can look at that statute and say, this

1

2

is terrible for defendants because now they've been

3

deprived of their jury right, or you can look at it and

4

say, that's terrific for defendants, because two-thirds of

the defendants now have a 25-year cap on their sentence,

so we don't see the fundamental fairness argument here.

The second point to be made about the Jones
rule -QUESTION:

Excuse me.

found, and must impose 40 years if a certain factor is

found.

Isn't that right?

That is true, but the question you

11

have to face is why you should erect a flat constitutional

12

bar to the legislature making that choice, and that is

13

informed by this analysis, I believe.

14

If the legislature knows it has only two

15

choices, zero to life, or make these into elements of the

16

offense and require proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it

17

may decide they're not important enough for that, and that

is not very protective of defendants.

19

If the legislature has the option of saying,

20

well, these intermediate steps we think are important

enough to be serious sentencing factors but they're not

important enough for us to make them elements of the

offense, we think constitutionally they ought to have that

choice, and that that is not going to be unfair to

rebuttal to a question posed by Justice Thomas concerning

21

the distinction between element of a crime and a

As we know, the statute in question says the

to intimidate because of race.

the -- if we want to address what the legislature in New

Jersey used by choice, the word purpose instead of the

word motive, it seems that where purpose or intent is an

ingredient of the statute, as it is here, that's a

question as to the existence of that motive or intent, and

that has to be a jury question, and I think that's the

difference.

There is a denial by the New Jersey legislature

of purpose in intimidating a person because of race.
