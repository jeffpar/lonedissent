ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

This is a case of ballot box racial

11

discrimination, plain and simple, that violates the two

12

bedrock constitutional provisions that commit our Nation

13

to racial equality.

his grandparents, his great-grandparents, as well as his

15

children and grandchildren, were born in Hawaii.

arguments that are made by the respondent with respect to

2

the justification for the racial classification under the

3

Fourteenth Amendment.

5

QUESTION:

No, but your answer to my question is

yes, isn't it?

6

MR. OLSON:

Yes, particularly with respect to

7

the Fifteenth Amendment, but Hawaii prohibits, despite the

8

fact he is a citizen, Mr. Rice from voting in a State-

9

conducted election for State officials who annually

10

distribute millions of dollars of proceeds from State-

11

owned property and money appropriated from Hawaiian

12

taxpayers.

13

When it comes time to vote in the election for

14

the board of Office of Hawaiian Affairs, it no longer

15

matters that Mr. Rice is a Hawaiian citizen and a Hawaiian

16

native.

17

ancestors he is no longer a Hawaiian, and he may not vote.

18

The clearest, simplest, and narrowest ground for

In that election, because he has the wrong

19

deciding this case may be found in the Fifteenth

20

Amendment, which declares that no citizen may be denied

21

the right to vote on account of race.

22

this Court has said, is the essence of a democratic

23

society.

QUESTION:

The right to vote,

Well, wouldn't a clear, simple way to

resolve this case in your favor be to say that the

mechanism here is just an overreading of Salyer and James

2

v. Ball, and that it denies one person one vote?

3

a general agency which is involved in housing, health,

4

education, taking general appropriations, and so it just

5

denies one person, one vote.

6

MR. OLSON:

This is

Well, I think that issue was in the

7

case and was withdrawn from the case.

I do agree with you

8

that it violates that provision of the Fourteenth

9

Amendment, but I think it is much easier to say that it

10

denies the right to vote on account of race.

racial determination, and the right to vote is being

12

denied here.

about holding that there are no exceptions to the

Fifteenth Amendment.

gerrymanders - -

Evasions and subterfuges such as

But if we were to say it denies one

18

person one vote under Reynolds v. Sims, that would give

you the relief you seek.

20

MR. OLSON:

If this Court rules in our favor on

21

that grounds, we of course would be satisfied.

22

it has been briefed and argued in this case on the

23

Fifteenth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment with respect

24

to a racial discrimination.

Would you explain that?

MR. OLSON:

I can't recall the circumstances,

Justice O'Connor.

preparing today that that issue was involved in the case,

but it was brought as a racial discrimination case, and

pursued as a racial discrimination case.

I remember reading something as I was

QUESTION:

May I ask on the racial

8

discrimination point, supposing there is a citizen of

9

Hawaii who has the same racial makeup as the native

10

Hawaiian, he came, however, from Tahiti or some place

11

else, and is a citizen of the State, has exactly the same

12

race as the others, but he's denied the vote.

account of race, because -QUESTION:

Even though he's of the same race as

those who were allowed to vote?
MR. OLSON:

Well,

it depends upon -- this Court

19

has said repeatedly that the definition of race relates to

20

drawing a line with respect to a person's ancestors.

21

is what Hawaii has done, and the reason why they have

22

drawn that line, and they've drawn it on the year 1778,

23

that is the first date on which a European arrived on a

24

permanent basis on the islands.

There is no question that what Hawaii was

If you an

Well, I -- even if the Tahitian is of

15

the same race, I mean, the fact that you give special

16

privileges to some people of one race, though not to all

people of that race, would not make it any better, would

it?

MR. OLSON:

The thing is, unless you're of that

race, you can't qualify.

MR. OLSON:

1

That's correct, and an interesting

2

example of that is Loving v. Virginia, where the Supreme

3

Court there was dealing with racial discrimination with

4

respect to miscegenation, interracial marriage.

5

a particular definition that allowed certain ancestors,

6

descendants of American Indians to qualify as white

7

persons for that purpose on the grounds that they may have

8

been descendants of Pocahontas.

There was

It is a question of ancestry, which this Court

9
10

has repeated over and over again, the decision of this

11

Court in College of St. Francis involved the

12

discrimination against an individual because he was of the

13

Arabian race.

people that were going to be admitted to the faculty - -

Even though he may have looked like other

QUESTION:

The Twenty-sixth Amendment treats age

16

identically to race in the Fifteenth Amendment, doesn't

17

it?

18

is it unconstitutional -- I'm sure it isn't.

19

think it wasn't -- to say that every 18-year-old in the

20

neighborhood has to vote for the director of the

21

neighborhood senior services center?

I mean, sometimes

22

you make discriminations, don't you?

I'm going back to

23

the point that they're not being treated on the basis of

24

race, but because they're beneficiaries of a trust.

25

The words are the same, but age instead of race, so

The legislature thought it was connected to

QUESTION:

MR. OLSON:

I think that's a totally

different -- no, I don't.
QUESTION:

All right.

Now, once you're down

10

that road, once you're down that road, then I get to where

11

Justice Kennedy began.

12

to assume about the characteristics of this "trust."

13

it's really just like a trust, I don't see why you can't

14

say the beneficiaries of the trust, and only they, will

15

vote for the trustees.

16

MR. OLSON:

I'm not certain what I'm supposed
If

First of all, Justice Breyer, the

17

land was put in trust, and it's not like a bank, a trust

18

in the concept of banks and trustees and beneficiaries.

19

It was a so-called public trust.

20

State of Hawaii for all the citizens of Hawaii.

21

has simply decided arbitrarily to set aside 20 percent of

22

the proceeds of that property, plus taxpayer revenue on

23

behalf of people, because they're descended of certain

24

people that lived in the island in 1778.

1

respect to 18-year-olds, as this Court has said, the right

2

to vote, and the right to vote and not being abridged the

3

right to vote on the basis of race, or color, or condition

4

of servitude, is vital to the functioning of the

5

democracy.

6

And this Court has frequently equated - - in

7

fact, the grandfather clauses are a good example, where

8

this Hawaii situation is indistinguishable, in a sense,

9

because it allows people to vote if they have an ancestor

10

that was in the islands in 1778 in the same way that

11

Oklahoma didn't impose a literacy test if you had an

12

ancestor that was permitted to vote in 1866 in Oklahoma.

13

This situation falls squarely within that limitation.

14

The word trust is an arbitrary term, and there

15

isn't really any -- there aren't any decisions from this

16

Court that say, simply because you call something a trust,

17

if the State of X decides we will provide benefits for

18

people of certain ancestry, suppose they're descendants of

19

people who were in the State of Texas when it was a

20

Republic, if that money is set aside from public funds,

21

and we will call it a trust, and therefore we will justify

22

the discrimination in the voting on the basis of the

discrimination in the giving, this Court --

Mr. Olson, isn't the Salyer case and

the Ball v. James case a useful tool for analyzing that

very thing?

I mean, is this a special use district, or is

2

it really more like a general governmental agency?
MR. OLSON:

3

It's a very good question, and the

4

respondent has relied upon that case.

You will recall

5

that that case involves a water irrigation district

6

created by the landowners in that area, the funds for

7

which came from the landowners, and the landowners in that

8

very narrow, local irrigation area or water conservation

9

district were the ones that voted as to how that worked.
This is an agency created by the constitution of

They perform general governmental functions like

17

education, providing benefits for economic advantage,

18

health care, and all of those things, the same sort of

19

general things that were not involved in Salyer, and in

20

fact in the Ninth Circuit, in an earlier case, the Office

21

of Hawaiian Affairs even claimed Eleventh Amendment

22

immunity on the grounds that they were, in fact, the State

23

of Hawaii, so this is - - there really is no comparison

24

with the Salyer case on the merits.

In addition, of course, Salyer did not create an

QUESTION:

Well, I think Mancari deserves some

4

comment, where special provisions and preferences were

5

provided for Native Americans.

6

Mancari indicates that some preference can be given to

7

Native Americans, at least, by Congress?

8
9

MR. OLSON:

Is it the case that

What this Court, Justice O'Connor,

did in the Mancari case is make it very clear that it was

10

analyzing the extent to which Congress had power under the

11

Constitution to act with respect to Indian tribes as

12

quasi-sovereigns under the Constitution.

13

Clause provides the Congress the authority to deal with

14

Indian tribes.

15

The Commerce

The Court, in the space of a relatively short

16

opinion, about six or seven pages of opinion focusing on

17

that particular issue, used the words Indian tribes,

18

quasi-sovereign tribes, federally recognized tribes, over

19

20 times to make the point very clearly that -- and to use

20

the language or the words of the Court in that case, the

21

preferences granted to Indians, which was a hiring

preference in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, not as a

No, because the unit that we're

reinforced that in the Yakima Nation case by saying, the

the Federal Government, not the State government, to enact

7

It's the answer that's hard,

The special permission is not given
It's given to Indians.

MR. OLSON:

Any Indian can

I think -- I think that that would

8

be unconstitutional, because Congress' power to operate

9

with respect to Indians, as this Court has made clear over

10

and over again, derives from the Indian Commerce Clause or

11

the Indian Treaty Clause, and that has to do with the

12

status of Indian tribes, not as Indian people.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

So if you had Alaska Natives, the

result would have to be different?
MR. OLSON:

Well, there are -- in fact there was

16

a specific distinction between the way Alaska was treated

17

and the way Hawaii was treated when it was entered into

18

the Nation, because there were Indian tribes in Alaska, so

With respect, it's not just one

It's a fundamental factor, recognized in the

text of the Constitution, and established a relationship
between the indigenous people who were here and the
nonindigenous people who arrived.
This Court's foundational cases on Indian law
are based on the relationship between the period after
European contact and prior to European contact, and the
Indian Commerce Clause, which is a manifestation of
Congress' plenary power over Indians, is descriptive of
the fact that the Europeans - QUESTION:

of sources, and this Court said in Mancari that Congress'
power derives both explicitly and implicitly from the
Constitution.

to this case, the Court said that not only does Congress

2

have the explicit power under the Indian Commerce Clause

3

to regulate commerce with Indian tribes, but it has

4

been -- there has been a long executive and legislative

5

practice and long line of judicial decisions recognizing

6

the power of Congress to do what it did here to extend

7

fostering care and protection to Indians, who are the

8

descendants of those once-sovereign, completely

9

independent nations, because of the responsibility that

10

the United States bears for having eliminated their

11

sovereign government and their control over their land.
QUESTION:

12

Did this suggest that had there been

13

this case, Sandoval, or these other things, suggest that

14

had there been no Indian Commerce Clause, Congress still

15

would have had plenary authority to deal with Indian

16

tribes?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

Perhaps, but I think the

18

important thing is that this is a power that recognizes --

19

that stems from or flows from the fact that there were

20

tribes, and the full powers of those tribes have been

21

eroded, but does not detract from the people, that Indian

22

communities remain distinct Indian communities.

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

I think there's an important

2

difference between the way the trust relationship has been

3

exercised by Congress over the years, which is a bilateral

4

relationship between the United States and the Indian

5

people, so giving resources and land and special benefits

6

to the Indian people is quite different from giving them

7

preferences in the outer world, and that distinction is

8

rooted in Mancari itself, where the Court said that case

9

would be different if the employment preference extended

10

to the entire Civil Service, or the country at large.

11

Why is that?

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Kneedler,

3

an interesting discussion, but I'm not sure quite how it

4

answers the question before us dealing with what Hawaii

5

can do.

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, we think that cases such as

7

the Yakima case indicate that where a State is acting

8

within a sphere in which Congress has authorized it to

9

act, that the State is entitled to enact measures to

10
11

promote self-determination in the same way.
QUESTION:

Well, but now this -- the funds

12

administered, as I understand it, also include tax dollars

appropriated by the Hawaii legislature.

QUESTION:

It isn't just Federal money.

16

Hawaii as a State has set up this scheme, and if the

scheme were to permit voting by others, does that violate

18

anything Congress has set out?

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

The -- Hawaii has done that,

20

but the important Federal act is the recognition of all

Hawaiian people as a distinct group.
