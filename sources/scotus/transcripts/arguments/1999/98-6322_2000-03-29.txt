CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 98-6322, Antonio Slack v. E. K. McDaniels.
Mr. Pescetta.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL PESCETTA

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. PESCETTA:

9

QUESTION:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Spectators are admonished, do not

10

talk until you get out of the courtroom.

11

remains in session.

The Court

Please proceed, Mr. Pescetta.

12

MR. PESCETTA:

Thank you, Your Honor.

13

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:

14

In the first argument in this case last fall, I

15

asked the Court to apply a common-sense rule to the

16

questions on which it granted certiorari, and to hold that

17

previous dismissals of the petition for exhaustion do not

18

render a subsequent petition second or successive within

19

the meaning of habeas Rule 9(b) because that's the only

20

position --

21

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Pescetta, I do have a

22

problem right off the bat with the fact that in a case

23

here called Hohn, H-o-h-n, we said that a request for a

24

certificate of appealability is a case itself and, if

25

that's correct, it looks to me like your client's case,

insofar as we treat it as a certificate of appealability,

2

anyway, was filed after what we call AEDPA's effective

3

date, and is governed by section 2253(c).
MR. PESCETTA:

4

Respectfully, Your Honor, I don't

5

agree that that's exactly what Hohn said.

6

Hohn said was that the case enters the court of appeals on

7

the application for the certificate of appealability.
QUESTION:

10

I think what

Well, I certainly thought that's what

it said, I have to tell you, so if I think that, then what
do we do?
MR. PESCETTA:

11

Well, I would refer Your Honor to

12

the authorities that we've cited, in fact, an old one

13

decided by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, that a case

14

proceeds, that the appeal is a stayed in the case that's

15

begun in the district court, and the respondents, and the

16

amici on behalf of respondents, have not offered an

17

alternative definition of the case.

18

indisputably -QUESTION:

19

Mr. Slack's case was

So if I'm correct about what I think

20

Hohn stood for, you'd say it was wrong and we should get

21

rid of it?

22

MR. PESCETTA:

I don't think I would put it

23

quite that way, Your Honor.

I would say that the motion

24

for a certificate of appealability addressed to the court

25

of appeals in Hohn, and in this case, elevates the case

that is in the district court into the court of appeals.

2

That is a case that is at that point ending in the court

3

of appeals, but it's not a case that's different or

4

separate from the case that's in the district court.

5

not - QUESTION:

It's

But it's a totally -- you know, if

you simply don't file a notice of appeal from the judgment

of the district court, the case is over.

MR. PESCETTA:

I disagree with that, Your Honor.

12

It's the case that's in the district court that is going

13

into a different phase.

14

McKenzie v. Engelhardt, is that the case --

15

QUESTION:

Well, but Hohn came considerably

after that.

17

MR. PESCETTA:

QUESTION:

a new case.

21

That's my understanding of

Yes.

And certainly I think -- I agree with
A fair reading of Hohn is that this is

MR. PESCETTA:

I don't think that that was this

22

Court's intent and, of course, this Court will tell me if

23

I'm wrong, but my understanding was that the point in Hohn

24

was that the filing of the motion for a certificate of

25

appealability gets the case from the district court in

some fashion to the court of appeals, in the same way that

2

in a case where you don't need a certificate of

appealability at all, simply the notice of appeal gets the

case into the court of appeals, but --

MR. PESCETTA:

8

QUESTION:

10

It

Yes, Your Honor.

And in order to make your opponent's

point here, it would have to be a new case.
MR. PESCETTA:

Exactly, Your Honor.

Mr. Slack's

11

case was pending in the district court at the time the

12

AEDPA was enacted.

13

transmute in some way.

14

the court of appeals on our motion for a certificate of

15

probable cause because, of course, since this was a pre-

16

AEDPA case, we asked under the old law for a certificate

17

of probable cause, and not a certificate of appealability,

18

and we entered the court of appeals with that case in the

19

same way that if we had prevailed in the court below and

20

the State had appealed to the court of appeals, the notice

21

of appeal would have vested jurisdiction in the court of

22

appeals over this case.

23

That case didn't go away.

It didn't

It's the same case that went to

The case hasn't changed.

Now, the point I think that was being focused on

24

in Hohn was whether there was anything pending in the

25

court of appeals on the motion for a certificate of

1

appealability in that case, and this Court said yes,

2

that's correct, and it's

our position that our case, the

3

case that was pending at

the time the AEDPA was enacted,

4

did vest jurisdiction in

the court of appeals to decide

5

whether to bring that case up by granting a certificate

6

of appealability, and it's the same case that's before

7

this Court on the propriety of the court of appeals'

8

denial of that certificate of appealability -- certificate

9

of probable cause.

10

QUESTION:

What was filed here was a certificate

11

of probable cause, I guess, not a certificate of

12

appealability.

13

MR. PESCETTA:

Yes, Your Honor, because at no

14

point in the prior proceedings in the district court or in

15

the court of appeals, or in this Court until the argument

16

in the fall, did the respondent State ever say that any

17

portion of the AEDPA applied to this case.

18

QUESTION:

Well, haven't a number of courts of

19

appeal treated those two things just interchangeably?

20

They've treated certificates of probable cause as

21

certificates of appealability.

22

MR. PESCETTA:

Only because the courts of

23

appeals have uniformly -- have not uniformly, but in the

24

main treated the -- or, the substantive requirements for

25

certificate of appealability as the same as those for a

1

certificate of probable cause and if, as we argue in the

2

second part of our argument, that all the certificate of

3

appealability was intended by Congress to do, which was

4

the only position asserted by the proponents of the

5

legislation, was to adopt the Barefoot standard, then it's

6

purely a question of terminology, terminology and, of

7

course, the specification of issues provision.
But I would submit that the State can't rely on

8

9

any defect either in the specification of issues

10

provision, or in whether we call this a certificate of

11

appealability or a certificate of probable cause, because

12

we asked the district court for a certificate of probable

13

cause.

14

of appeals denied the certificate of probable cause under

15

pre-AEDPA law, and this Court granted certiorari on our

16

petition under pre-AEDPA law, and the question of whether

17

any portion of the AEDPA would apply to this case was

18

injected into this case by the State Attorney General

19

amici, who claimed that there was a jurisdictional problem

20

under section 2253.

Issue was joined under pre-AEDPA law.

But our position is simply that Lindh controls

this case.

23

enacted.

24
25

The court

Our case was pending at the time the AEDPA was
There's no dispute about that.
QUESTION:

Well, what Lindh held was essentially

that there is no retroactivity provision in section 153,
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400

1

and therefore the normal rules of nonretroactivity apply,

2

and the normal rules of nonretroactivity for a statute

3

that sets forth the substantive requirements for habeas

4

would not apply that statute to any cases that were filed

5

already when the statute was enacted.

6

But the normal rules of retroactivity do not

7

apply uniformly to every matter governed by a statute.

8

mean, you might have in the same statute the alteration of

9

the substantive requirements for a crime, okay, the

I

10

alterations of the requirements for filing a lawsuit, and

11

the alteration of evidentiary requirements in the course

12

of a trial.

13

application of each one of those three is quite different.

14
15
16

Now, what would constitute a retroactive

MR. PESCETTA:

I agree that they might be

different, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

That's right, and what Lindh involved

17

was the substantive requirements for habeas, and it said

18

this would be retroactive if you applied the new

19

substantive requirements to a case already filed.

20

But it's an entirely different question as to

21

whether requirements concerning the requirements for

22

appeal are being applied retroactively so long as you

23

apply them to cases that are not yet on appeal, and I

24

think that's what's going on here, and it seems to me not

25

at all contrary to Lindh to say that the requirements for

1

appealing are governed by the new law.
MR. PESCETTA:

2

Your Honor, my understanding of

3

Justice Souter's opinion for the Court in Lindh was that

4

we have these two chapters,

5

mandating that the chapter

6

apply to cases pending at the time of the act, the

7

negative, the strong negative inference arose that the

8

chapter

9

and the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure are in

10

11

chapter

54 and

53.

By clearly

54, the opt-in provisions,

53 provisions and the amendments to section 2253

53, don't.
QUESTION:

They say generally.

12

generally do not apply?

3

MR. PESCETTA:

4

QUESTION:

Would you say

Yes, Your Honor.

And I think the reason it said

5

generally was because some of those provisions do not deal

6

with the initial substantive requirements for getting

7

relief, but deal to such matters as what are the

8

conditions for appeal.

9

MR. PESCETTA:

That's why it said generally.
Respectfully, Your Honor, I think

20

that there is a different explanation.

21

provisions are not stand-alone.

22

instance, the review provisions of section 2254(d), which

23

were in the chapter

24

separate appeal section.

25

The opt-in

They do not have the, for

53 amendments.

They don't have the

And it's our view of what Lindh intended to hold
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

by that use of the word, generally, was that anything that

2

falls within the opt-in provisions that are covered by

3

chapter 154, take along with them the general provisions

4

that were enacted by the AEDPA as to those cases which

5

qualify for the opt-in treatment.

6

I'd emphasize Mr. Slack's case is not only a

7

nonopt-in case, it's not a capital case, and so under

8

those circumstances, if you are in the opt-in world, all

9

of the amendments to both chapter 153 and 154 would apply.

10

But if you're not under chapter 154 there, I

11

think, is no basis for saying that the chapter 153

12

amendments which apply to everybody else apply to a case

13

pending, which Mr. Slack's case clearly was at the time

14

the AEDPA was enacted.

15

QUESTION:

They certainly don't apply

16

retroactively, but what constitutes a retroactive

17

application of them is another question, and I don't

18

consider it a retroactive application of them to say that

19

they apply to all cases that seek an appeal after the

20

enactment insofar as their provisions governing appeals

21

are concerned.

22

MR. PESCETTA:

I submit that the inference that

23

this Court drew in Lindh with respect to the difference

24

between the opt-in and the nonopt-in chapters, is exactly

25

the same in both situations, especially since we have the

1

additional problem that applying different parts of AEDPA

2

to different parts of the case and different cases,

3

depending on whether they're on appeal or not, would raise

4

the same kind of -- I think Justice Breyer referred to it

5

as a mare's nest of problems.

6

QUESTION:

But I thought, Mr. Pescetta, that you

7

said in the second part of your argument, this is a nice,

8

academic discussion.

9

for the issue that's before this Court, whether it's a COA

It really doesn't matter, because

10

or whether it's a CPC, that what you have to satisfy is

11

the same.
That is, since you're not relying -- you're not

12

13

saying the State court misapplied any Federal statute.

14

You're claiming a constitutional right, as is usual in

15

habeas cases, so I thought you were saying in the second

16

part of your argument that it doesn't make any difference.
MR. PESCETTA:

17

I will turn to that now.

I think

18

the fact that it shouldn't make any difference reduces

19

somewhat the force of the negative inference to be drawn,

20

as in Lindh, from the focus on pending cases in chapter

21

154.

22

state argues for of the appeal provisions, the stronger

23

that negative inference is that they shouldn't be applied.

24

But to turn to Your Honor's question, and to the

25

I think the more -- the greater the impact that the

question that I think Justice O'Connor raised about
12

1

jurisdictions in the last argument,

2

certificate of appealability standard is that you have to

3

show -- make a substantial showing of a denial of a

4

constitutional right.
And,

5

the current

in using that terminology,

I submit that

6

there is no evidence of any sort suggesting that Congress

7

had any intent in using that phrase, other than to use it

8

as a shorthand for the phrase, violation of the

9

constitutional laws or treaties of the United States that

0

appears in section 2254 and in 224 , and that's consistent

11

both with this Court's practice, with this Court's use of

12

the terminology, and with the use of the indiscriminate

3

use of the term,

Federal right, constitutional right,

4

throughout the AEDPA.
QUESTION:

5

I would just like -You're saying, then, that when the

6

AEDPA says constitutional right it really means any sort

7

of a right claimed under a Federal statute?
MR. PESCETTA:

8
9
20

23

it means

constitutional laws or treaties of the United States as a
shorthand.
QUESTION:

2
22

I think, Your Honor,

That's a strange way of expressing

it.
MR. PESCETTA:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

24

you look at McCleskey v. Zant,

for instance, where this

25

Court is discussing the history of the great writ, at

If

1

pages 478 to 479 of 499 U.S., this Court's majority-

2

opinion, authored by Justice Kennedy, refers to and quotes

3

Wainwright v. Sykes as saying, quote, review is available

4

for claims of, quote, disregard of the constitutional

5

rights of the accused and later on, quote, the writ today

6

appears to extend to all dispositive constitutional claims

7

presented in a proper procedural manner.
So my position is, if that kind of shorthand --

8

9

because I don't think that there was any intent in

0

McCleskey or in Wainwright v. Sykes -QUESTION:

11

12

What was being discussed in McCleskey

was a constitutional right, so it makes perfectly good

3

sense there to talk about -- that language wasn't intended

4

to cover the whole scope of habeas.
MR. PESCETTA:

5

Well, Your Honor, that's exactly,

6

I think, my point, is that this Court uses shorthand the

7

same way that Congress does.

8

to redress constitutional rights, you don't say -- in

9

every opinion you don't repeat the phrase from section

20
2

When you say habeas is there

2254 -QUESTION:

Well, but in an opinion where the

22

habeas claim is based on a constitutional right, it makes

23

perfectly good sense to say, here we have a constitutional

24

claim made under the habeas statute, but when Congress

25

says it's not talking about any particular claim that's

1

being raised in a case, such as we do, when it says the

2

denial of a constitutional right, I think it's certainly a

3

very plausible inference it means that and nothing more.

4

MR. PESCETTA:

The difficulty with that, Your

5

Honor, is, it doesn't look at the whole statute which, of

6

course, is one of the standards of statutory construct --

7
8

9

QUESTION:

But this is the provision that is

dealing with what can be raised.
MR. PESCETTA:

Yes, Your Honor, but if you look,

10

as we have argued in our briefing, at the use of the term,

11

constitutional right and Federal right, throughout the

12

AEDPA, particularly -- and I would cite as kind of exhibit

13

A, you know, under section 2254(d), a grant of habeas

14

relief is allowed if the State court's disposition

15

violates clearly established Federal law.

16
17

QUESTION:

Isn't your underlying claim here one

of constitutional right?

18

MR. PESCETTA:

19

QUESTION:

20
21
22

And don't you think there is a

substantial claim?
MR. PESCETTA:

Yes, Your Honor, and that has not

been argued --

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. PESCETTA:

25

Well, yes.

So wouldn't you fall within it?
-- and the State hasn't argued to

the contrary.

In fact, do you have even any

5

statute.

6

He's not raising any Federal

He's not raising any treaty.
MR. PESCETTA:

Yes, Your Honor, and that's the

7

second part of our argument, is that whatever this

8

provision means, it can mean only the review of the

9

substantive underlying claim.

There is no decision by any

10

court that says a denial of a -- a substantial showing of

11

a denial of a constitutional right cannot be made on the

12

basis of showing, as in this case, that the district court

13

erroneously refused to address a substantive

14

constitutional claim at all because of a procedural error.

15

QUESTION:

That's interesting, and you would

16

apply that consistently?

You would always look at the

17

underlying claim, so that even if the underlying claim --

18

if the underlying claim was statutory, or based upon a

19

treaty, and then in the disposition of that claim the

20

procedural right that was denied was so fundamental that

21

it was a violation of the Constitution to deny that

22

procedural right, and then the violation of that

23

procedural right is sought to be appealed on habeas, you

24

would dismiss it because the underlying claim, after all,

25

is not a constitutional claim.

That's what you said.

What we are saying is, you have a substantive

That's the basis for relief.

The State, and amici's position, is that if
review of that underlying claim that you've raised in your

Federal petition is barred by a procedural error that the

11

district court commits, such as in this case by holding

12

that a petition is second or successive when it's not,

it's their position that this amendment to 2253 prevents

us from ever getting any appellate review of that

question, either as to the underlying substantive question

or as to the validity of the procedural ruling.

inconsistent with this Court's practice, it is

contradicted by the use of the -- by AEDPA's explicit

limits on this Court's jurisdiction such as in 224 -- such

as in 22 -- section 2244(c), or rather 2244(b)(3)(E),

where in AEDPA the Congress said, you cannot review on

Lindh that the question of whether the provisions apply

2

turns on whether the case that they governed was pending

3

when AEDPA was enacted and, because those provisions

4

govern only the discrete proceeding in which the habeas

5

petitioner seeks authorization to appeal, we think that's

6

the relevant case for determining their applicability.
QUESTION:

7

But why?

Why?

It's very logical.

That is -- I mean, I

the judges and all the courts of appeals, and who knows

what they've decided, and the certificate isn't the

most -- the name on the certificate, whether it's CPC or

15

some other name, isn't so important, and all of a sudden

appeals are generated, and the law's about the same

of case there in more or less the following terms:

said that the denial of this threshold condition does not

prevent a case from being in the court of appeals.

we

We in effect -- we did not say in Hohn that the

COA request was itself a separate case, as -- and Justice

Scalia suggested a moment ago, we didn't say it was

13

something new, and in fact elsewhere we spoke of the, in

essence the indivisibility of the merits of the case from

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, first, I don't think that

you can read Hohn that way, Your Honor, because -- because

20

under Hohn the case couldn't have been in the court of

21

appeals, the underlying case couldn't be in the court of

appeals because a certificate hadn't issued, so Hohn had

You probably ought to say something

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

10

That's part of the reason

Yes, okay.

-- before you have to sit down.

MR. ROBERTS:

We believe that petitioner is

11

entitled to a certificate only if he makes a substantial

12

showing of the denial of a constitutional right and when,

13

as in this case, the district court has denied relief on

14

procedural grounds.

15

That showing has two parts, first, that there's

16

a substantial argument that he can overcome the procedural

17

bar and, second, that there's a substantial argument that

18

his habeas petition raises a meritorious claim.

19

appeal if there's a clear procedural bar to relief,

20

because permitting appeals based on the abstract merit of

21

the underlying claim when relief on that claim is

22

unavailable would thwart the purpose of a certificate

23

requirement to prevent frivolous or unnecessary appeals.

24
25

He can

And he also can't appeal if his underlying
constitutional claim clearly lacks merit, even if the

1

district court may have erred in denying relief on

2

procedural grounds, and that limitation is imposed by the

3

term, constitutional, in the certificate standard, and it

4

accords with the purpose of the certificate requirement,

5

because there's no need to correct a district court's

6

procedural error if that error prevents consideration of

7

only meritless claims.
We don't think that appeal is foreclosed just

8

9

because the district court denies relief on procedural

10

grounds.

Precluding appeals from procedural orders in all

11

cases would not further the purpose of the certificate

12

requirement, because it would bar appeals of meritorious

13

habeas petitions that raise constitutional claims, and it

14

wouldn't be consistent with the text of the certificate

15

standard either, because a prisoner makes a substantial

16

showing of a denial of a constitutional right if he makes

17

a substantial showing that his conviction was imposed in

18

violation of the Constitution and the habeas court erred

19

in refusing him relief.

What do you think we should do with

MR. SARNOWSKI:

It doesn't say that

If you read the section, that

14

being -- or Rule 2(c)(1), subsection (B)(ii) to mean that,

15

while it says you have to make a substantial showing of

16

the denial of a constitutional right, but that doesn't

17

limit what you can litigate, then I would agree with your

18

question.

read where one provision is included and then say, but it

20

could include other provisions as well, just by practice.

21

Our position simply is, I don't think you can

In this instance, a case cited by the petitioner

22

23

daily basis may think that was a really bad choice if it

2

indeed exercised its power to do so, but where Congress

3

has spoken, as we believe they have in the COA provision,

4

then it has spoken, and we assert that in this instance,

5

where Mr. Slack's petition, the five claims that were

6

really at issue, all of which he brought in well after

7

AEDPA became effective, all of which we believed and the

8

district judge believed accordingly that were unexhausted

9

and four of the five were abusive, abuse and unexhaustion,

0

simply don't have anything to do with having a meritorious

11

claim.
QUESTION:

But the claims that he brought were

3

constitutional claims, so one could surely read this

4

subsection (c) of section 2253 to mean that even if you

5

could surmount the procedural hurdle of adequate,

6

independent State grounds, still you don't get a

7

certificate of appealability unless you show that you had

8

made a claim about what went on in the State criminal

9

proceedings of the denial of a constitutional right.

20

So that seems to me the most logical reading of

21

this provision, that it's talking about what is your basic

22

habeas claim.

23

Because there was a constitutional flaw in the proceedings

24

in the State court.

problematic for the Federal courts before or now.
MR. SARNOWSKI:

20

Well, the Fourth Circuit

22

when a prisoner there asserted the violation of a treaty

from what I was saying, that if this -- except that under

2

the old law you could raise something under a treaty or a

3

Federal statute, and you brought up a rare case, where the

4

underlying claim would be a treaty or a statute, but

5

mostly these are complaints about something that violated

your constitutional right, and it's usually some

procedural right.
MR. SARNOWSKI:

9

That is the great majority of

the type of claims that are filed, I would grant you that,

10

and I would also indicate that, while it would forge or

11

require a significant change to disallow rulings by the

12

Federal circuit courts on those issues, it is not one that

13

is outside the boundaries of Congress' power to make,

14

MR. SARNOWSKI:

There is, but the very small

number of cases that arise under the IADA or Federal

constitutional means under the statute, and that is, of

course, the question that the Court has asked us to try to

speak to and, unfortunately, there aren't -- there isn't a

lot of case law, and the case law that is out there has

been cited by both sides, the Teeterman case being the one

on which we primarily rely from the Eighth Circuit.

In briefly addressing the other question that
this Court had asked the parties to look at, and that is

10

the change to the actual statute itself, that is, the

11

abuse-of-the-writ statute, we have submitted our assertion

12

that the abuse-of-the-writ statute in this case, the

application of the new statute frankly would make no major

14

difference in the outcome compared to the old statute.

And particularly the application of Rule

happen, and the Solicitor General answered that this Court

colloquially call the parking lot procedure, whereby they

Those -- many cases are still pending,

a doubt about the correctness of the procedural ruling,

2

you would have to -- you would have to allow appeal.

3

I don't see -- in other words, I don't see how

4

the Solicitor General gets the second half of his

5

interpretation of 2253(c)(2).

6

that you look to see whether the underlying claim is a

substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right,

but, he says, if the procedural ruling was, you know,

The first half he says is

you don't get a certificate of appealability.

how we can impose that latter condition.

12

MR. SARNOWSKI:

I don't see

Well, in that regard, and the

State's last brief, the amicus brief authored by

California, I believe speaks to it, in that if you note

the language of 2253 subsection (c)( )(A) it requires, or

it allows an appeal to be taken to the court of appeals

only upon the final order in a habeas case, and the

In this instance, there was a written ruling

So then you would have the higher, intermediate

In many instances, you don't have that.

Well, I guess -- could you argue that

just the introductory phrase of (c)(1), unless a circuit

justice or judge issued a certificate of appealability an

appeal may not be taken, and maybe implicit in that is

10

that they wouldn't issue a certificate of appealability

unless they thought that the ruling was -- you know, was

Could you say it's implicit in that language?
MR. SARNOWSKI:

I think it's the practice.

don't know if the language makes it implicit.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL PESCETTA

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. PESCETTA:

4

There's a thread in this Court's statutory

interpretations cases that's expressed in Justice

6

Kennedy's opinion for the Court in Hohn, Justice Souter's

7

opinion for the Court in Jones v. United States, that's

expressed in many other cases, that we do not -- it is not

in practice without making that intent clear.
What the State's position on the scope of the

12

certificate of appealability is that without any

13

indication, any discussion, Congress intended by enacting

14

section 2253 to erect an entirely one-sided system of

15

review of procedural errors in habeas cases in the Federal

16

court, and the idea that Congress would have done that,

17

would have imposed on this Court and on the courts of

18

appeals the burden of regulating district court procedural

19

rulings in habeas cases by extraordinary writ, simply is

20

not reasonable.

The substantiality question that's been raised

22

by the argument of the Solicitor General as to the

substantiality of the underlying claim, we have to

underlying claim.

All we have is a procedural ruling

2

covering allegations which for the purpose of a motion to

3

dismiss have to be taken as true.

4

It's our position that if the procedural ruling

5

covers allegations of a substantial constitutional claim,

6

then the procedural ruling has to be reviewable, otherwise

7

we have a monstrosity of a statute which is replicated in

8

no other area of the law, where one side has the right to

9

have procedural errors reviewed and the other doesn't.

QUESTION:

12

13

You agree that if the procedural

ruling itself is clearly correct, you don't get a COA?
MR. PESCETTA:

I don't necessarily -- well, I

14

think the problem with the historical practice -- the

15

short answer is yes, I would agree with that.

16

The problem is, because of the predominance of

17

procedural issues in habeas practice, the practice has

18

developed that we focus on the procedural issue as the

19

grounds for denying the COA -- rather, the CPC, and the

20

underlying merits of the constitutional claims are assumed

21

because, for the purpose of a motion to dismiss, they have

22

to be taken as true.

Third, there is no change, as it has been

24

expressed, from Federal to constitutional in the statute.
