ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER HELLERSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

The Court remains in session.

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves a constitutional challenge to

14

two mechanisms that California employs to deny

15

nondomiciliary corporations, like petitioner here, an

16

otherwise allowable interest expense deduction.

17

these mechanisms provides an independent basis for

18

invalidating the application of California statute to

19

petitioner.

20

Each of

First, as respondent has stipulated, California

21

denied petitioner an interest expense deduction entirely

22

because it received nontaxable dividends from nonunitary

23

subsidiaries.

24
25

Second, California denied petitioner an interest
deduction because those dividends were paid by

subsidiaries that did no business in California.

2

worth stressing at the outset, Your Honors, that the

3

second mechanism is indistinguishable from the taxing

4

scheme that this Court struck down in Fulton Corporation

5

v. Faulkner.
QUESTION:

6

It is

Well, I suppose we don't have to

7

answer all the questions here if we were to find that the

8

interest offset is unconstitutional because it taxes

income over which California lacks jurisdiction to tax.

That's the end of it, presumably.

That is correct, Justice

Either basis would be -- would invalidate the

14

During the tax years at issue here, 1980 to '82,

15

petitioner Hunt-Wesson, which is the successor in interest

16

to the original taxpayer in this case, the Beatrice Foods

17

Company, earned lawfully $75 million in dividends from

18

nonunitary subsidiaries.

19

California had no power to tax those dividends under this

20

Court's decisions in ASARCO, and Woolworth --

Now, it is undisputed here that

QUESTION:

Beatrice was an Illinois domiciliary

22

the same way Hunt-Wesson is?

23

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

24

Beatrice was an Illinois domiciliary.

25

Wesson is a California domiciliary, but they -- again,

Yes, Chief Justice Rehnquist,

During the years at

Now, during those same years, California denied
Beatrice an interest deduction --

QUESTION:

Beatrice, I think.

It's named after

6

a little town in Nebraska, and I think it's pronounced

7

Beatrice.

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Beatrice.

Mr. Chief Justice,

I will pronounce it Beatrice.

10

(Laughter.)

11

QUESTION:

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Smart move.

During these years, Beatrice

14

received a -- its interest expense deduction was denied on

15

a dollar-for-dollar basis simply because it received these

16

nontaxable dividends.

17

There is no evidence, no evidence at all in this

18

case that the interest expense bore any relationship to

19

these dividends.

20

had proven that every penny of our interest expense had

21

gone to generate California taxable income, we would have

22

been denied this interest expense deduction simply because

23

we had these nontaxable dividends.

25

Indeed, even if we had proven -- if we

What if

the interest expense had been incurred to generate

is from income from securities in Germany, would it then

I want to give you a hypothetical in

8

which the interest expense is incurred to generate

nonunitary income but not the nonunitary -- not the same

10
11

nonunitary income that might be earned elsewhere.
MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Yes, Justice Stevens, I

12

understand your question, and the answer to your question

13

is that this statute works regardless of any proof of any

14

relationship.

There could be a relationship,

interest, business interest income we have, and then we're

2

denied the deduction if we have the nontaxable dividends.
QUESTION:

3

But the interest has to be business

4

interest income, does it not, used for a purpose -- the

5

money has to be used for a purpose in connection with the

6

business, or does it not?

7

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

The interest expense that we

8

have, the interest expense is defined at the Federal

9

level.

We use a Federal taxing scheme, so the Federal

10

Government does not distinguish between whether or not the

11

interest expense is business or nonbusiness.
Now, under the California statute and under

12

13

their own -- or their own schedule, the very first thing

14

we do is, we take any interest expense that is, in fact,

15

attributable to the nonbusiness income, and we take that

16

out of the mechanism.

17

the interest expense associated with the business.

18

that interest expense that in fact is put into this little

19

mechanism that California has that denies us on a dollar-

20

for-dollar basis the deduction against the nonunitary

21

dividends.

Then the only thing that is left is
It is

3

That is correct, Justice

Souter.

Let me explain that, because there has been a

5

dispute, and both sides say the dispute doesn't matter.

QUESTION:

7

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

8

QUESTION:

9

Could you tell me, for -Yes.

-- I was about to ask what you mean

by nonbusiness interest expense.

Is it just interest

10

expense, or nonbusiness income, for that matter?

11

that mean just income that California can't tax, or does

12

it have some other meaning?

13

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

QUESTION:

15

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Does

Yes.

Let's get a definition.
Okay.

Let's start with

16

nonbusiness income.

17

under this uniform statute that many States have is

18

allocated, that is, is sent to one jurisdiction or

19

another, rather than put into this mix that's mixed up and

apportioned.

bit more -- I've got to polish it a bit, because in our

2

case that's correct.

3

nonbusiness income we're talking about are nonunitary

4

dividends, and there's no dispute that California can't

5

tax that.

In our case the particular

If, for example, Beatrice had an unrelated

6

7

beauty parlour in California, California could have taxed

8

that.

That might be nonbusiness income, but if it was in

California it could have been taxable.
10

there's no distinction.

11

nonbusiness income is not taxable.

12

But in this case,

There's no dispute that the

Now, to answer your question about what is

13

nonbusiness interest expense, I think we use that term,

14

and I don't think there'd be any disagreement here, we

15

would use that term to describe any interest expense that

16

could be directly traced to the nonbusiness dividends.

17

If, for example -- and there's no evidence in

18

this case that anything like this happened -- if, for

1

example, we had gone out and borrowed money to acquire the

20

nonunitary subsidiaries, and you could trace that

21

borrowing to the nonunitary subsidiaries, then to be sure

22

you would have nonbusiness interest expense, and we

23

would -- our position here is that California could

24

probably deny that.

25

They could probably deny it if they had a

tracing mechanism, which they don't, if they said, we've

2

seen that you've gone out and you borrowed money to buy

3

something that's going to generate income that you can't

5

which is that it's impossible to trace.

All the money is fungible.

7

use this.

Again, we can -- we accept that proposition.

All interest is
Who knows where we

The problem is that California statute doesn't

8

9

Indeed, we even accept their notion,

implement that proposition.

When, in fact, you don't know

10

where the interest expense is earned, that is, you can't

11

do the tracing that we're talking about, what do

12

jurisdictions do?

13

QUESTION:

I'm not sure what you accept insofar

14

as the fact that all money's fungible and can't be traced.

15

You say you accept that proposition.

16

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

17

QUESTION:

No, what I'm saying is --

And that's -- it seems to me that you

18

might accept that proposition in some instances, but not

19

in every instance, or then you'd lose your case.

20

wrong?

21

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Or am I

I think, Justice Kennedy, I

22

don't believe you're right that we'd lose our case,

23

because we're willing to -- we accept the proposition that

24

a State can reasonably take the position, and California

25

in this case could reasonably have taken the position that
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

(800) FOR DEPO

1

all money is fungible, and therefore it is impossible ever

2

to trace on a direct basis a dollar of interest income to

3

a dollar of interest expense.
But even accepting that proposition, one thing

4
5

is clear from -- when you accept that proposition that you

6

are then saying, you don't know where money is coming from

7

or going, but then it cannot be -- it cannot be assigned

8

disproportionately to nontaxable income rather than to

9

taxable income, so even accepting the notion that money is

10

fungible, all we're saying -- and we're not saying --

11

we're not trying to constitutionalize any particular

12

methodology.
All we're saying is, do what 48 other State, or

13
14

45 other States do, do what the Federal Government does.

15

Spread it around on any of a variety of reasonable bases,

16

including, if you'll read the letter that California's

17

already written to General Electric if they lose this

18

case, spread it around based on where your assets are.

19

That is, if you don't know where your money's coming

20

from --

21

QUESTION:

Or deny the deduction altogether.

22

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Justice Kennedy, if California

23

wanted to deny all interest deduction to all taxpayers,

24

whether they had taxable or nontaxable income, we wouldn't

25

be here.

We think that's quite arbitrary.
11

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

It might no

1

longer be a net income tax, but that's not the

2

constitutional issue raised by this case.

3

The problem here is that what California has

4

done is, under the guise of saying money is fungible, come

5

up with a mechanism that disproportionately assigns

6

income, at least in our case, to the nontaxable income, so

7

based on the undisputed facts of this case, California's

8

taken the position that somehow we never make a dollar, a

9

penny -- we never make a penny from interest expense

10

11

invested in nonbusiness income.
QUESTION:

But if California could deny interest

12

deductions in toto -- your claim here is more of an equal

13

protection claim, that you've been treated differently

14

than other California corporations similarly situated, and

15

I'm not sure that's made out.

16

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

No, Chief Justice Rehnquist,

17

our claim is that while we agree that California could

18

have an across-the-board nondiscriminatory treatment of

19

interest expense, what California is doing, and the court

20

below held -- the trial court held they were violating the

21

Equal Protection Clause, but we've not raised that here.

22

We're saying that what this does, what this

23

statute does is two things.

First, it sweeps nontaxable

24

income into the tax base.

25

That's an extraterritorial component.

That's a due process violation.
California in fact

says that we're going to measure your tax by these

2

dividends out there that we can't get our hands on under

3

ASARCO, under Woolworth, number 1.

4

Number 2, we're also -- in our view this also

5

has a discriminatory component, because when you look at

6

who gets this interest deduction it's only the domiciliary

7

rather than the nondomiciliary.

8

statute is, it helps the domiciliary because these -- this

9

interest expense is always attributed to the nonbusiness

As arbitrary as the

10

income, which in this case would be taxable by California,

11

so the nondom -- so the domiciliary gets the full tax

deduction, whereas the nondomiciliary --

13

QUESTION:

Oh, I don't see how that helps you.

the other part, but I mean, after all, it's an Illinois

No, Justice Breyer, because

California does.

Do you know, does that really happen?

So in other words when California insists that the tin can

And therefore the -- this

would -- it would generate nonbusiness dividends.

17

California would say, gee, you have interest equal to

18

those nonbusiness dividends, no deduction, and then in

19

Illinois -- then the question would be whether Illinois

20

would take the same position, and the answer is no,

21

because Illinois, being a State that is not off the radar

22

screen like California, but does what other States do,

23

they'd look at their interest expense, see whether or not

24

this interest was associated first with the Outer

Well, on that basis maybe you could

It says, if a deduction of the entire amount of

interest expense is allowed, the corporation stands to

gain a tax windfall, and then it goes on.

10

that's only because California does not have an

apportionment system in place, is that correct?

answer that?

won't be a windfall.

17

You'll say, well, sure, but if you have an

Is that how you answer that?

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

Actually, Justice Kennedy, the

18

way I would answer that, I think that's because of

19

California's Californiacentric view of the universe.

20

fact, there is no windfall, because Beatrice pays taxes in

21

45 other States, so that the -- any income -- we're not

22

talking about tax exempt municipal bonds here.

23

income that California says is not taxable in California

24

because it's not a unitary -- part of the unitary business

25

is presumably taxable somewhere else.

In

I mean,

1

The only time there would be a windfall would be

2

if the income that California is not taxing under a proper

scheme is somehow not taxed by the other jurisdiction.

Well, is the answer there wouldn't be

a windfall if there were an apportionment scheme?

you accept that answer?

I would certainly accept that

8

if California apportioned in the way that other States

apportioned, there would be no windfall, that is correct.

But you don't intend, do you,

Mr. Hellerstein, that California has to have the same

Indeed, to look at this Court's own opinions,

either municipal bond income that wasn't taxable at the

2

Federal level, or alternatively, Federal taxable income

3

that wasn't taxable by the States, and what the Court has

4

said -- when the Court has looked at this, the Court has

5

really rejected both extremes.

6

The Court has rejected the extreme view of the

7

States, which has been to say -- or the taxing authority,

8

when the taxing authority has said, you may not deduct

9

1 penny of this expense -- that is, the expense must be

10

matched dollar-for-dollar against the tax-exempt income,

11

which is what the -- the kind of situation that arises in

12

National Life, the Court said, you can't do that, because

13

that really undermines the exemption.

14

On the other hand, when taxpayers have been

15

greedy, when taxpayers have said, we don't want $1 of our

16

expense assigned to our nontaxable income, because that

17

undermines the exemption, the Court has said no, that's

18

not right, either.

19

What the Court has said is really precisely what

20

most States and the Federal Government have said in this

21

kind of situation, is when you don't know, when you can't

22

trace the amounts, what you do is, you spread it evenly.

23

This Court has said, there's no reason in law, or no sound

24

legal or economic reason for distinguishing between the

25

taxable and the nontaxable dollar.

That's the theme.

Federal constitutional law and also valid Federal

1

Justice O'Connor, is that what California is trying to do

2

with this statute is basically eliminate a double tax

3

benefit that arises whenever a corporation, number 1,

4

incurs debt, and there is therefore interest expense

5

generated by that debt, and at the same time has funds

invested in nontaxable activities which produce nontaxable

income.

The problem is that part of the debt either
directly or indirectly is used to support the nontaxable
activities.
QUESTION:

But you solved that problem by

denying it against all nonunitary income whether or not

13

the interest expense was related to it.

principle, which your opponent is quite willing to accept,

2

what it leads to is not the conclusion that you can tax

3

all of it, but the conclusion that you should apportion

4

it.

5

MR. LEW:

Well -- well, I disagree with the idea

6

that it is being taxed.

After all, the formula itself

7

allows as a first step an allocation of interest expense

8

against a corporation's business interest income, so to

9

the extent that the amount of business interest income

10

is -- swallows up the entire amount of the expense, then

11

all of it is allocated to reduce the corporation's

12

California taxes.

13

QUESTION:

I don't see what that -- I mean, most

14

businesses, except if they're in the financial business,

15

don't have a lot of business interest income compared to

16

their other business, so I don't think that helps too

17

much, does it?

18

MR. LEW:

Well, I think it -- I think it

19

demonstrates that the statute applies its rules in a fair

20

and even-handed way.

21

under California's statute for a corporation to come out

22

better than it would under a proportional approach, and I

23

think that that is one of the things that has to be

24

understood, that the statute does allocate interest

25

expense to interest income and dividend income in a fair

I mean, certainly it is possible

1

and in an even-handed basis.

In fact, the first step of

2

the statute allocates it to business interest income.

3

And with regard to the -- what the statute does,

4

it basically shifts those deductions which it considers to

5

be attributable to nontaxable income to the -- it

6

attributes it to the income which is then taxed -- which

1

is then allowed as the deduction by the State of domicile

8

if, in fact, that State utilizes a statutory scheme which

9

is similar to California's.

10

Now, it is true that none of the other States

11

currently adopt such a provision, but under this Court's

12

internal consistency analysis I'm not sure whether or not

13

that's a constitutionally significant point.

14

it were the case that all of -- that all States utilized

15

this formula, then the taxpayer would be able to have the

16

benefit of all of the deductions which California has

17

essentially shifted over to the State of domicile and

18

enjoy a reduction in its nonbusiness income in that State.

19

If in fact

It -- the statute simply attempts to assign

20

interest expense to its proper use or application, and it

21

does so on a dollar-for-dollar basis against its business

22

income and against the corporation's nonbusiness income.

23

In that sense, it is applied even-handedly, and again,

24

those deductions would be available to the corporation in

25

the State of domicile under a consistent -- internal

consistency analysis.

2

Now, as I said, the proportionality approach is

3

one way of dealing with the problem, but again it doesn't

4

solve the problem of a corporation obtaining a tax benefit

5

completely, because to the extent that less than --

QUESTION:

Wait, only if Illinois or, you know,

California's business.

MR. LEW:

QUESTION:

13
14

If some other State wants

Sure.

I agree.

So -- but that's the tax benefits

you're talking about.
MR. LEW:

No.

I'm talking about the tax benefit

15

that arises when a corporation incurs debt, is able to

16

write off the interest expense from that debt, and at the

17

same time use that debt, either directly or indirectly, to

18

generate income which California is not permitted to tax.

19

That is the double tax benefit that I'm talking about.

20

QUESTION:

Yes, but California asserts here the

21

right to treat it as though it was all used, the money, to

generate nonbusiness income.

MR. LEW:

That is correct.

others don't under it?

5

MR. LEW:

I'm not sure if I understand your

question completely, Your Honor, but let me try to answer

7

it this way.

8

that can be leveled against California's statute can also

9

be leveled against a proportionality approach in the sense

I think that the argument -- the criticisms

10

that a certain portion of interest expense is being

11

allocated to nonbusiness, nontaxable income.

12

Now, we don't know whether or not the amount

13

that was allocated is the correct amount, but it does have

14

the effect of increasing the corporation's tax in the

15

State of California, so to the extent that that can be

16

viewed as an indirect taxation of nontaxable income, that

17

is what is being done there, and that's the same criticism

18

that's being made in our case as well.

QUESTION:

You can't ask the State to do more

MR. LEW:

Well, I think that

I think that in

2

that the court, the California supreme court has held that

3

it does not result -- that the allocation of interest

4

expense to nontaxable income on a dollar-for-dollar basis

5

does not constitute a tax, I think it's still applicable

6

here, even in light of Allied-Signal and other cases.

7

QUESTION:

The argument has been made that if

8

you look at how the Federal taxation works, income

9

taxation, in the main there is an allocation, but there's

10

also an argument that at least in one respect the Federal

11

income tax -- I forgot whether it's -- it has something to

12

do with foreign investment, or foreign corporations, that

13

the Internal Revenue Code does what California does in

14

that one discrete area.

15

MR. LEW:

That is my understanding, yes, Your

16

Honor, that there is a dollar-for-dollar allocation

17

allowed under certain circumstances in the Federal scheme.

QUESTION:

So you could make the argument that

19

if it's rational for the Internal Revenue Code to do that,

so it's rational for California to --

MR. LEW:

I think there's a basis for doing

that, Your Honor.

265 of the Internal Revenue Code as well provides for a

1

is the only place that does that in the code.

There's a

2

rule which my law clerk found which is a controlled

3

foreign corporation netting rule, and that has to do with

4

a circumstance where you have to allocate income expense

5

to certain foreign source income earned when you lend the

6

money to a controlled foreign corporation and there's both

7

been an increase in lending and an increase in borrowing.
And under those circumstances there is some

8

9

rationality, where you've loaned more money to your offÂ­

10

shore corporation, and at the same time you've increased

11

the borrowing, so I could at least see a rational there

12

for saying we're going to assume this extra lending is

13

allocated to the extra borrowing, but I don't think you

14

even have anything like that here.

15

MR. LEW:

16

QUESTION:

Well, I -In other words, it's a tracing rule,

17

rather than an allocation rule.

18

asking is that you either allocate or trace, but you've

19

done neither.

MR. LEW:

21

QUESTION:

22

23

All that your opponent is

Well -The Federal provision seems to try to

trace.
MR. LEW:

Right.

The California statute is

24

definitely not a tracing rule.

It's actually just an

25

assignment rule, and it's basically based on the idea that

1

it's extremely difficult, if not impossible, to trace

2

interest expense to its ultimate use or application, and

3

again it's just based on the idea that this is what --

4

California's interest in trying to close this loophole.
That's what the statute is trying to do, and I

5
6

think that to the extent that that constitutes a

7

legitimate State objective, I think it certainly

8

accomplishes that goal, and it does so, I think, in a fair

9

way in the sense that it does allow that first step to

10

allocate interest expense to -- on the basis of business

11

interest income, and to the extent that there is any

12

remaining, it does allocate it against its nonbusiness

13

income.

14

QUESTION:

Why can't you just ask the taxpayer

15

to assume the burden of persuading you that any

16

interest -- any income, or interest deduction that it

17

seeks to obtain is attributable to the unitary business?

18

MR. LEW:

Well, I think that that is -- that is

19

one way to go, but I think that's also subject to

20

manipulation as well, Your Honor.

you're trying to determine, you know, a corporation's

any type of concept of motive or, you know, purpose, and

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

Thank you, Mr. Lew.

MR. HELLERSTEIN:

I have three very brief

8

points.

First, with regard to the CFC netting rule that

9

both Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg referred to,

10

you're quite right, Justice Breyer, the CFC netting rule

11

is, in fact, a very finely tuned tracing rule, as Justice

12

Scalia said.

13

there's -- you go to some unrelated lender, you borrow

14

money, you then relend that money to your controlled

15

foreign corporation, the controlled foreign corporation

16

then pays you interest.

17

It only arises in a situation when

That's the situation we're talking about.

If

California had anything like that, we certainly wouldn't

20

specific tax evasion problem which actually doesn't

22

we're talking about.

jurisdictional problem.

Again, a finely tuned mechanism addressed to a

are vulnerable to the same sort of criticism that we're

making, and that's not true.

3

making is that the California formula disproportionately

5

those other formulas do it on an even-handed,

nondiscriminatory basis.

The criticism that we're

All of

And finally, his suggestion that, because the
statute is internally consistent it is therefore
constitutional, is a non sequitur.

It would be -- if

10

California had a statute that assigned income based on the

11

number of square miles in a State, that would be

12

internally consistent, but I think would plainly be

13

unconstitutional and, indeed, in cases involving

14

retaliatory taxes, which are entirely consistent, this

Court has also held they are unconstitutional.
