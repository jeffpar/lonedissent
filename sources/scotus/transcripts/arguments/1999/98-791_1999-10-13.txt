CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMIAH A. COLLINS

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS KIMEL, ET AL.

9

MR. COLLINS:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Employees of State agencies who have been

12

injured by violations of the Age Discrimination in

13

Employment Act are not barred by the Eleventh Amendment

14

from suing the States in Federal court for redress,

15

because Congress unequivocally authorized such suits in

16

the statute, and Congress had the power to do so

17

under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

18

The authorization of these suits is established

19

by the incorporation into the ADEA of section 16(b) of the

20

Fair Labor Standards Act.

21

provides for suits by employees against public agencies,

22

including the States,

23

this Court observed last year in Alden,

24

those suits without regard for consent.

25

That section specifically

in State or Federal court and, as
it provides for

By incorporating this provision into the ADEA,

1

together with provisions which state that claims under the

2

ADEA will be deemed to be claims under the Fair Labor

3

Standards Act for this purpose, Congress unequivocally-

4

authorized these suits and abrogated the State's Eleventh

5

Amendment immunity.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Collins, how many other Federal

7

statutes purport to abrogate State sovereign immunity

8

without specifically referring to the Eleventh Amendment

9

or to sovereign immunity?

10

MR. COLLINS:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. COLLINS:

QUESTION:

I'm not sure --

Because this statute doesn't.
That's correct, Justice --

And I just wondered how many others

14

there might be that use similar language without any

15

reference to the --

16

MR. COLLINS:

I don't have the number, Justice

17

O'Connor.

18

not refer to the Eleventh Amendment, and the statute in

19

Union Gas didn't refer to the Eleventh Amendment or

20

sovereign immunity, and the Court held in both of those

21

cases that the intent was clear to abrogate.

22

The statute, of course in Seminole Tribe did

QUESTION:

In our case, Kennecott Copper,

Employees as well, Your Honor, under the FLSA, but here

2

Congress has gone further, as the Court observed in Alden,

3

and clearer,

4

courts State or Federal, and to suits against any

5

employer,

in that it refers among other things to

including a public agency.
And we also know, not merely from legislative

6

7

history but from the retroactivity provision of the 1974

8

amendments to section 16(b), that Congress amended section

9

16(b)

into its present form for the specific purpose of

10

providing the clear statement of intent to abrogate that

11

the Court had found lacking in Missouri Employees.

12

So in these -- in this situation the specific

13

phrasing referring to public agencies, State or Federal

14

courts, combined with the retroactivity provision making

15

it unambiguous that the purpose of this provision is to

16

provide an abrogation as to suits against States in

17

Federal court, we believe is unequivocally clear.

18

QUESTION:

Is --

19

QUESTION:

Suppose you had -- excuse me.

20

Suppose you had a jurisdiction where the State

21

has waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity in its own

22

courts, but insists on the immunity in the Federal courts,

23

wouldn't it be fair to say that the State court is a court

24

of competent jurisdiction, but that the Federal court is

25

not?

MR. COLLINS:

1

I don't believe that's correct,

2

Justice Kennedy.

3

is a phrase used in many statutes.

4

person conceivably could sue in an appellate court,

5

a small claims court, but this Court held in Wisconsin

6

Department of Correction v. Schacht that the fact that an

7

Eleventh Amendment immunity could be available in a

8

particular case does not mean that the Federal court lacks

9

jurisdiction over that case, lacks original jurisdiction.

10

The -- of course, competent jurisdiction
If it weren't used, a
sue in

So it seems to me that the phrase, competent

11

jurisdiction, cannot properly be construed as importing

12

defenses of consent or lack of consent,

13

I think Schacht is clear on that, and again,

14

clear,

15

retroactivity provision of the '74 amendments that we have

16

here a statute that's unusually explicit in being designed

17

to provide the statement of clear intent that the Court

18

upheld in Missouri to have been missing from the FLSA

19

prior to the '74 amendments.

it is quite

I think not only from Alden but from the

QUESTION:

Mr. Collins,

in answer to Justice

21

O'Connor's question, you mentioned the IGRA that figured

22

in Seminole that didn't use, make specific reference to

23

the Eleventh Amendment.

24

title VII make a specific reference to it?

25

MR. COLLINS:

Remind me about title VII.

1

no,

it does not, and I believe that there are numerous

2

others that do not make a specific reference.

3

QUESTION:

And in this case the term public

4

agency is specifically defined to include a State,

5

correct?

is that

6

MR. COLLINS:

That's correct.

7

Now, Congress had the power to abrogate State

8

immunity from claims under this statute because this is a

9

statute aimed at arbitrary discrimination against a class

10
11
12

13

of people based on stereotypes about that class.
QUESTION:

Well, probably the statute goes

beyond any constitutional substantive limit, does it not?
MR. COLLINS:

It does, Justice O'Connor, and it

14

certainly goes beyond what the courts acting without

15

congressional guidance could find to be unconstitutional,

16

but it does so, as I'll undertake to explain,

17

that's congruent, to use this Court's terms, with the

18

constitutional prohibition.

19

in a way

And the heart of the statute, the core, the

20

reason it was enacted, and the purpose that is served by

21

its various provisions,

22

Court has called invidious discrimination in McKennon --

QUESTION:

is to get at a form of what this

Was there any more indication in the

history of this legislation other than trying to reach the

was some need to reach State and local employment -MR. COLLINS:

2

3

I don't think that's the case,

Justice --

4

QUESTION:

-- legislation, isn't that true?

5

MR. COLLINS:

I would say not, Justice O'Connor,

6

because even in 1967, in the years leading up to the

7

initial enactment, what Congress was looking at, and what

8

the Labor Department, for example, studied in the reports

9

it gave to Congress, was the general approach that

10

employers of all sorts took to decisionmaking based on

11

age, and the Labor Department surveys, for example, did

12

include public agencies.
Many -- there were -- Congressmen referred to

13
14

public agencies along with private employers in '67, and

15

what Congress was finding in 1967, based on the

16

information it was receiving, was essentially a pervasive

17

problem in our society of how people look at older

18

workers.

19

QUESTION:

You say that Congress was addressing

20

its attention to invidious discrimination and yet, in our

21

Murgia case, we said in effect that there wasn't, under

22

the Constitution, invidious discrimination when you

23

classify it on the basis of age, so can Congress change

24

that constitutional law?

25

MR. COLLINS:

No, Congress is not changing

constitutional law, Mr. Chief Justice, and in Murgia the

2

Court did not say that there could never be

3

unconstitutional or invidious discrimination based on --

4

6

QUESTION:

No, but certainly it approved the use

of stereotypes.
MR. COLLINS:

I would not -- not a stereotype of

7

the sort that Congress was concerned with in the statute.

8

It approved a generalization, but what Congress --

9

QUESTION:

Well, what's the difference between a

10

generalization and a stereotype?

11

MR. COLLINS:

12

13
14
15

Well,

I would say the difference,

Mr. Chief Justice, what Congress -QUESTION:

I would like your answer to that

question, not what Congress -MR. COLLINS:

One can make a generalization

16

regarding any classification which is for the most part

17

true but will have certain exceptions, and which is

18

essentially grounded in a rational determination.

19

One can have a stereotype, which is what

20

Congress found to be happening with regard to age, where

21

one has a generalization that first of all is not accurate

22

even on the average, which is what Congress -- what the

23

Labor Department determined and what Congress accepted,

24

and which reflects not a rational assessment of

25

qualifications, but a prejudice, an unfounded prejudice.

QUESTION:

1

2

Any unfounded prejudice is

unconstitutional.

3

MR. COLLINS:

4

QUESTION:

At least --

I mean,

I find it extraordinary that

5

Congress would have felt the need to enforce the

6

Fourteenth Amendment in an area where there was no opinion

7

of this Court saying that the Fourteenth Amendment was

8

violated, and a suggestion that it wasn't violated.

9

Congress just went ahead and identified on its own this

10

serious constitutional violation that had been occurring

11

throughout the United States that, the existence of which

12

is not reflected in a single opinion of the Supreme Court.

13

MR. COLLINS:

Justice Scalia, the judgment

14

Congress made is in no way inconsistent with anything

15

reflected in the decisions of this Court.

16

had said in Murgia and Vance and Gregory was not that age

17

in general, or certainly not always,

18

for decisions.

19

What the Court

is a rational basis

The Court in those cases looked at the

20

particular jobs in question,

21

Gregory at the difficulty,

22

individual judgments, and found a rational basis under a

23

form of --

looked particularly in

jobs.

We're just concerned, and we're going to increase

2

the number of jobs in the labor force by having mandatory

3

retirement at age 55, no indication that people can't do

4

the job after that, and that is unconstitutional.

5

MR. COLLINS:

That kind of a judgment would be

6

closer, Justice Scalia, because it would not be based on

7

the kinds of stigmatizing attitudes towards people's

8

ability that Congress found to be pervasive.

9

What Congress found to be the basic reason that

10

older workers were not being retained were stereotypes

11

about their qualifications, not economic judgments of the

12

nature of --

MR. COLLINS:

17

QUESTION:

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. COLLINS:

But --

-- a lot of us can testify to.

But Mr. Chief Justice,

I think two

20

points are crucial about Murgia and Vance and Gregory.

21

First,

22

instances the evidence about the particular jobs that made

23

it rational to conclude there was a significant problem of

24

inability of older workers, and an impossibility of making

25

individual determinations.

the Court emphasized the nature and in some

(202)289-2260

And secondly, and equally important, the Court

1

2

emphasized that it was applying a mode of review that

3

applies when the courts are acting without congressional

4

guidance.

5

review are rules the courts devise when Congress has not

6

spoken, and that were being applied to legislative

7

judgments where the legislators don't -- can't be called

8

into court to explain all their reasons.

As the Court said in Cleburne, standards of

9

The Court in fact emphasized that one of the

10

justifications for the limited role the courts play in

11

reviewing age-based classifications is that age is a

12

matter that the political process can deal with.

13

a discrete and insular minority, and Congress --

14

QUESTION:

Well, was the suggestion that the

15

political process could deal with it by making new

16

constitutional law?

17

It's not

MR. COLLINS:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, and we

18

don't believe that's what's been done here.

19

constitutional law here is that you cannot use arbitrary

20

classifications where they are too attenuated.

21

The basic

This Court has said, for example, property

22

ownership, it's not a suspect classification, but the

23

Court held unanimously in 1989 that it violated the Equal

24

Protection Clause to deny certain Government positions to

25

people because they didn't own property.

1

QUESTION:

Yes, and if Congress had addressed

2

itself in the ADEA to simply arbitrary and irrational

3

judgments based on age, but it seems to me it went a good

4

deal further than that and said that between 40 and 65,

5

that you simply could not discriminate in any way between

6

these people.

7
8

MR. COLLINS:

It didn't go quite that far,

Mr. Chief Justice, and I think actually it established a
scheme which is more proportional to the Equal Protection

10

Clause core than in the voting rights cases,

11

because what Congress did,

12

the Labor Department that there are some instances when

13

employers rely on age in a noninvidious, rational way.

14

it recognized,

One area was benefits.

for example,

it learned from

Another was where an

15

employer can show that some older workers, because of

16

their age, are unable to perform satisfactorily, and it's

17

not practical to make individual determinations, as was

18

the situation in Gregory, for example, as the Court

1

emphasized.

20

reliance on age in that circumstance.

21

Sometimes you can't.

Congress allows

So what Congress has fashioned here is a system

22

of proof and defenses which, we submit,

23

to get at the arbitrary,

24

Congress was aiming at.

statute or, as far as you know,

2

that Congress believed that such invidious discrimination

3

by the States was unconstitutional?

4

MR. COLLINS:

in the legislative history

There's no reference to the

5

Constitution, Justice Scalia.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. COLLINS:

That's extraordinary.
There are comparisons to title VII

8

and to other discrimination statutes which Congress

9

certainly knew had been passed to deal with constitutional

10
11

problems, but of course -QUESTION:

You're saying Congress took this

12

action in order to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, but

13

makes no reference to the Fourteenth Amendment in the text

14

of the statute, or any reference to the fact that it

15

thought this action was unconstitutional.

16

MR. COLLINS:

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

17

That was the case in Fullilove, and that was the

18

situation, of course,

in Wyoming, where the Court --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. COLLINS:

Fullilove has been overruled.
Not on the point that Congress'

21

section 5 power could be considered as a source of the

statute, despite the fact that Congress hadn't mentioned

1

Fullilove, and even the dissent, both said we will view

2

this --we will analyze this as legislation adopted under

3

section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, even though the

4

fact was Congress had not referred to that.
And the Court has always said that what we do

5
6

when we review the permissibility of a congressional

7

enactment is to look at what Congress has done and see,

8

with a presumption of constitutionality, whether there is

9

any constitutional power to support it.

The Court has

10

never required that Congress identify the power it's

11

invoking.
QUESTION:

12

But it's one thing to say you're

13

acting under section 5, which gives the enforcement power

14

to Congress, but then for Congress to go and say we're

15

acting under section 5 but we don't even mention what

16

constitutional provision we're talking about seems

17

strange.

18

MR. COLLINS:

But I submit, Mr. Chief Justice,

19

that if Congress has made clear its judgment as to the

20

nature of the conduct it is dealing with, and it made that

21

clear here not only in '67 but in the '74 legislative

22

history that it believed it was dealing with arbitrary,

23

invidious discrimination, it seems to me the fact that

24

Congress did not then finish the sentence and say, and

25

that violates the Constitution,

is not dispositive as to

refusing to hire people over the age of 40 on the basis of

myths and stereotypes.

exclude one reason for losing the worker, and that's not

that the reasons actually used by employers, namely, the

belief that they were less productive, more often absent,

showed, and that that's the belief on which the employers

It was a State with an employment -- with an age

2

discrimination law, and yet the studies that California

3

had done established that age discrimination was rampant

in the public service in California, and that further

5

legislative efforts and administrative efforts would be

6

necessary to do something about it.
QUESTION:

7

Ms. Underwood,

in that respect it

8

resembles title VII, doesn't it, because there were EEO

9

laws in the States long before title VII came on the

10

books, and I believe when title VII was extended to public

11

employment, State and Federal, the vast majority of States

12

had their own antidiscrimination statutes.
MS. UNDERWOOD:

13

That's correct.

It's never --

14

it would be surprising to think that the existence of race

15

discrimination and sex discrimination law somehow

16

eliminated the race and sex discrimination problem and

17

made it unnecessary even in public employment, and made it

18

unnecessary for a Federal law to address a problem either

19

in the workplace at large or in public employment

20

generally.

QUESTION:

Of course, the reason for the

Maybe, but I've never heard it argued

16

MS. UNDERWOOD:

is not entitled to the same kind of constitutional

scrutiny as race discrimination and therefore has to be

It's you

MR. SUTTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the Court:
In 1974, Congress became the 26th legislature in

12

the country to enact an age discrimination law that

13

applied to public employees.

14

Court in EEOC v. Wyoming held that the Age Discrimination

15

Act was permissible Commerce Clause legislation that

16

applied to the States.

17

In 1983,

7 years later, this

We do not challenge that holding.

In the Wyoming case,

four justices also reached

18

the question whether the age laws were permissible

19

section 5 legislation.

20

We agree with that reasoning for two reasons.

21

Congress failed unmistakably to abrogate the States'

22

immunity from suit and, second, lacked the power to do so.

23

They concluded that they were not.

As to the clear statement point,

The court enforcement provision that has existed

in 626(c)

626(c) enforcement provision already existed, was not

Congress did a useless act.

2

The useless act was to have 626 (c) , the very-

on the grounds that there was a rational basis for the

MR. SUTTON:

suspect categories, but sex discrimination, as I think was

pointed out, even in the time title VII was extended, the

only decision on the book was Reed v. Reed, and that

applied a rational basis test.

of the fact that Congress is allowed, as a predictive

matter, to make its own judgment about what the

Constitution means, and in 1972 it is true, when Congress

18

extended title VII to gender discrimination, gender

19

discrimination still received rational basis review.

doesn't mean it would be impossible to use it, but it

would have made it a lot more difficult.

is an excellent example

That certainly goes to federalism,

to the question of proportionality?

MR. SUTTON:

No,

it is relevant.

QUESTION:

It's not even
It just doesn't get you across the

line.

4

the disparity between the scope, as determined by the

5

burden of proof, let's say in 1983 litigation, and the

6

burden of proof under this statute, is not dispositive

7

totally, without consideration of such factors as those

8

that Justice Ginsburg and I have been mentioning.

But in any case, you are taking the position that

MR. SUTTON:

Just, when you say 1983 litigation,

10

you're referring to litigation involving equal protection

claims --

MR. SUTTON:

Yes.
-- exactly.

Well, Your Honor, I

14

do think it is unfortunately a contextual facts, fact and

15

circumstances inquiry where you have to look at all of

16

those things, but it seems to me at the threshold this

17

Court's Western Airlines decision makes it crystal clear

18

that on the one hand the age laws were designed to deal

19

with prohibiting the employers from making the

20

generalization that mental and physical acuity decline

21

with age.

22

In contrast to that are this Court's trilogy of

23

decisions where they say that is permitted by Federal and

24

State legislatures, so that -- that strikes me as a very

25

serious threshold problem.

Now,

1

it all.

it doesn't mean that you don't consider at

2

all,

3

that it is a fact and circumstances test, and that there

4

is no Rosetta Stone here, and the reason that's good is

5

because the greater the underlying violations, the more

6

remedial power Congress ought to have.

7

In fact,

I think we should embrace the fact

So I think it's appropriate to embrace that fact

8

and circumstances problem, because while it's difficult

9

for this Court when it comes to drawing those lines,

I

10

think it's appropriate to have the freedom to give

11

Congress much more authority in situations where there

12

truly has been a record,

record of pervasive and systematic discrimination against

certain classes --

The -- I would like to,

1

if I could,

in closing,

2

it seems to us, we would respectfully submit, that the age

3

laws are unlike any other prophylactic section 5 law this

4

Court has ever upheld.

5

Instead of pervasive discrimination by State

6

employees, we have a situation in which all 50 States

7

overprotect the constitutional rights of their citizens.

8

Instead of a calibrated remedy that seeks to parallel the

9

constitutional standard, we have an entirely new standard

10

of review that directly contradicts this Court's decision

11

in Western Airlines, and instead of systematic,

12

constitutional violations of the protected class, we have

13

absolutely none.

14

It would seem to me a sad and unfortunate irony

15

to uphold this broadest of section 5 laws precisely in the

16

areas where the State is not only respecting the

17

constitutional rights of their citizens, but in fact

18

overprotecting them.

MS. UNDERWOOD:

As to the fact that this Court

2

has not found an age discrimination unconstitutional,

3

like to point out that this is no different from what

4

happened with literacy tests for voting.

5

I'd

The Court upheld English literacy tests as a

6

reasonable voting requirement, then Congress found that

7

English literacy tests were being used invidiously and

8

prohibited them, and this Court said Congress had properly

9

used its fact-finding power to enforce the Equal

10
11
12

13

Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
As to the -- well, in fact, this is stronger
than that, because Congress in 19 -QUESTION:

It's not quite parallel, because the

14

discrimination there is discrimination on the basis of

15

race or national origin, which was clearly

16

unconstitutional discrimination, and the only issue was

17

whether this device achieved it or not.

18

is whether the discrimination on the basis of age in and

19

of itself is unconstitutional.

20

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, no,

What we have here

it's whether -- I

21

think it's -- the parallel is much stronger.

22

age discrimination which could in principle be proper, as

23

literacy tests could in principle be proper, was being

24

used in an unconstitutional, arbitrary, and irrational

25

way, warranting congressional review, warranting a remedy

It's whether

1

under the enforcement power of the Equal Protection

2

Clause.

3

As to the proposition that age is different from

4

race and sex, Congress calibrated this statute to that.

5

The reason age was not put in the 1 64 Civil Rights Act

6

was that there was an awareness that there are proper uses

7

of age, that seniority systems and pension plans and other

8

decisions that are made in the workforce are properly
calibrated to age, but there are also irrational and

10

arbitrary ones, and so a separate study was commissioned

11

and a separate statute was written to deal with precisely

12

that problem, to tailor the remedy to the constitutional

13

violation that Congress perceived.

14

As to Mr. Sutton's observation that there is no

15

predicate for this, there wasn't then and there isn't now

16

in the world, Mr. Sutton is right to focus on individual

17

decisions of State employers.

18

largely aimed at today in view of the demise of mandatory

1

retirement, but the reported cases under State and Federal

20

statutes do show examples of irration -- the same kind of

21

irrational, unconstitutional, arbitrary age discrimination

22

that Congress was concerned about,

23

essentially harassing and insulting an older worker

24

because of his age, situations where a reduction in force

25

was required and the employer simply went down the age
