ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
California Government Code section 6254(f) (3)

11
12

requires Government agencies to provide access to the

13

addresses of arrestees and crime victims in only a few

14

instances, none of which include commercial solicitation.

15

The statute in this respect is similar to at least 80 laws

16

from around the country that limit access to a wide

17

variety of Government records,

18

reports, welfare records, accident reports, and even the

19

personal financial disclosure forms of the members of this

20

Court.

21

including campaign finance

Respondent contends that subsection (f) (3)

is a

22

speech restriction, but the text of the statute, which I

23

want to spend just a couple of minutes focusing on, shows

24

that plainly is not true, and it is reprinted in the

25

appendix to the blue brief at page 3.

One point to make at the outset is that

subsection (f)(3)

3

of the other information that the State has about crimes

4

and about crime victims and about arrestees, but

5

subsection (f)(3), regarding the addresses of both the

6

victims and the arrestees --

8

limits access to only addresses, not any

QUESTION:

Where is this in your brief, Mr.

Goldstein?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The appendix to the blue brief,

10

Mr. Chief Justice, at page 3.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

3a?

Okay, thanks.
And subsection (f)(3)

teaches

13

that with respect to addresses of both crime victims and

14

arrestees, the State grants access only, quote, where the

15

requester declares, under penalty of perjury, that the

16

request is made for one of five specified purposes.

17

are, a scholarly, journalistic, political, governmental

18

purpose, or investigation purposes by a licensed private

19

investigator.
QUESTION:

20

Those

Well, could the respondent just

21

publish this in a little newspaper format and claim a

22

journalistic exception?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It's just his

That is exactly right, Mr. Chief

7

Justice, with respect both to the victim and to the

8

arrestee.

QUESTION:

Well, the Jail Mail Register that's

10

in the record, isn't that an illustration of what looks

11

like a newspaper but really has a mailing list, or --

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, I think the difficulty is,

13

and again the lower courts never reached this question and

14

it would remain open on remand, is what precisely

15

respondent wants to do with the addresses, with respect to

16

the Jail Mail Register.

17

If you look at the end, the last page of the

18

different instances of the Jail Mail Register that are

19

published, respondent isn't using the addresses for a

journalistic purpose.

I take it henceforward under the statute the

No, and let me -- that is

exactly the distinction that I wanted to get to with the

Mr. Goldstein, or an ordinance?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

3

It is a State statute, Your

Honor.

4

QUESTION:

I'm still not totally clear on your

5

explanation.

Are you saying that when someone gets the

6

information and, say, lists 30 people, as I see on page --

7

whatever this is, page 4 of the record, there's a big list

8

of names and addresses, that what he has to promise is

9

that his purpose in listing all these names and addresses

10

and sending a piece of paper with that list to various

11

people who pay, he has to promise that his purpose is not

12

to get paid for the list?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It is not to sell a product or

service, that is exactly --

It has a dial­

If you are a newspaper, or you are the local

8

television station, and you have a journalistic purpose,

9

then you have a right to get access, but if your purpose

10

in doing so is simply to sell a product or service, it

11

doesn't qualify.

12

And if I could just make one qualification, and

13

that is that there -- the only reason there is some

14

ambiguity here is that the statute was enjoined

15

immediately.

16

contemplates that law enforcement agencies, local

17

governments, will issue further guidance specifying

exactly what the terms -- and you asked the question, what

exactly is political.

QUESTION:

There will be further guidance.
Well, had the statute never been

construed by the State courts?

It has not.

provision under which respondent or anybody else has the

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

the people who had been arrested in Sacramento. I didn't

11

QUESTION:

What if a newspaper had a different

12

policy from the one that you tell us prevails, and simply

13

did publish this information as a matter of course, and

14

every day a reporter went down and requested it and got an

15

accurate list and so on, and the paper published it.

16

Would the paper be in violation of the statute?

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It would depend on the specific

18

facts, and to take them just as you say, if all that they

19

were doing -- say that the Los Angeles Times publishes

20

out -- publishes a special version for lawyers, and it

21

says, look, we've got everybody who's arrested for DUI,

22

would be a much closer case, and I think what you would

23

see, honestly,

is the California legislature addressing

that problem.

Let's assume that the paper simply

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

8

QUESTION:

9

Would it be in violation

It would not, but the --

Why would it not, because when it

made out its affidavit, it would know perfectly well,

10

assuming the statute remained in its present form, that

11

individuals such as the respondent here would use the

12

information and in any event would know that the purveyors

13

of services would use the information, so how could it

14

make out the affidavit?

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Because on the text of the

16

statute the sentence about selling a product or service

17

does not limit the scope of the first sentence.

like to focus on that, because what the Court did not say

2

is that when the Government has information that it is

3

under no strong form of constitutional compulsion to make

may not condition its release of that information in

That is not a general release even when you give

was invading people's privacy, but that commercial

services were gathering them and selling them to

5

6

Now, if we were in a world of heightened -- of

7

the most heightened First Amendment scrutiny, presumably

8

that would not be enough, because we don't say the

9

Government can proceed one step at a time normally in a

10

true heightened scrutiny case, but this is not a true

11

heightened scrutiny case, because this is not a case where

12

what the Government has said is, you have information and

13

you may not publish it.

14

What the Government has said is, we have

decided it wanted to let investigative journalists have

11

I mean, the notion that you can't give

if the State is not obliged to do this, but

interviews with prisoners, but nobody else?
MR. DuMONT:

Well,

I think particularly in

12

contexts where there are what amount to constraints on

13

quantity -- I mean, you can't have everybody traipsing

through the prisons, so when you have a constraint on

quantity, or there's a limited number of seats in a

The members of the Court have suggested you

MR. ENNIS:

Chief Justice Rehnquist, it is not

Are we to assume for

2

purposes of this case that the Government could say,

3

nobody gets this information?

4

MR. ENNIS:

Justice Ginsburg,

I think that's a

5

very difficult question, and it's not necessary to resolve

6

that question here.

7

As KQED itself makes clear, the Government there

8

could have excluded everyone from coming into the prison,

9

but as Justice Stewart's concurring opinion, which made

10

the plurality, stresses, although the press does not have

11

a superior right of access above and beyond what the

12

prison accords to the public, once the prison accords an

13

access right to the public, the press has an equal right

14

of access unless there is a strong justification for the

15

discrimination.

16

Equality of access, once the prison has opened

17

its doors to some, was the key concept in KQED.

MR. ENNIS:

Why isn't that a pure access issue?
For the reasons we list in our

denial of access would be highly constitutional suspect.

The State is not just saying, we don't like

Now, why isn't that a satisfactory reason?

MR. ENNIS:

Justice Ginsburg, let me answer that

question by beginning to say first, the Government doesn't

9

so this is not like the subsidy cases.

10

It doesn't claim

that it needs to limit this information in order to -QUESTION:

11

Well, it is a scarce resource,

12

because the lawyers who are chasing clients can't get them

13

without the address information.

14

MR. ENNIS:

Not in this sense, Justice Stevens.

15

In a subsidy context, the Government cannot give the same

16

dollar bill to every speaker who wants it, but it can give

17

the same address information to every speaker who wants

18

it.

There's no scarcity problem here.

MR. ENNIS:

In practical terms it is, Justice

4

Souter.

5

excerpts of record, pages 496 through 547 are examples

6

from the Sacramento Bee, which on a regular basis,

7

several times a week, prints what's called the Police/Fire

8

Log, which lists the names and addresses and charges of

9

everyone.

If you'll look at the record, supplemental

I think

QUESTION:

Okay, there's --

11

QUESTION:

But the addresses, it's not just a

12

question of getting mail, it's a question of people

13

staking out your house, and finding out where you live.

14
15
16

MR. ENNIS:

You can get that.

Anybody can find

that information from the Sacramento Bee.
QUESTION:

No, but they don't find that from

17

newspapers in the State generally.

18

every -- if every State went to the practice that obtains

19

in Sacramento, you would have a much stronger argument,

20

because nothing would be advanced by this prohibition.

21

It may be that

But in the world that it exists now, at least

22

outside of Sacramento, it seems to me it's hard to argue

23

that it does not have a substantial advancement of the

24

stated interest.

25

MR. ENNIS:

First, it's not just Sacramento.

1

That's the excerpts in the record, but there are also

2

declarations about Oceanside, California and other places.

3

But this cuts our way, because think about it,

4

if you're an arrestee, and some newspaper publishes, any

5

newspaper publishes this information to the world at

6

large, you've got to worry about that problem.

7

Contrast that with getting a private,

8

confidential letter in the mail from an attorney or bail

9

bondsman.

10

!

QUESTION:

But the State's argument -- and I

11

mean, you're right if you accept the premise, but the -- I

12

think the State's assumption is that you don't get a

13

letter, you get a whole slew of letters.

14

from lawyers, you get them from social workers, from

15

alcohol and drug abuse counselors and so on, and it kind

16

of drives you crazy, and it seems to me that we speak of

17

privacy, but we're really sort of speaking of annoyance

18

and harassment --

19

MR. ENNIS:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

You get letters

Your Honor --- and is that not in the Government

interest?
MR. ENNIS:

We all get, every day, junk mail

23

that drives us crazy, and junk telephone calls.

24

opt-out remedies for that.

interest in reducing the volume of that stuff?

2

(Laughter.)

3

QUESTION:

4

You don't think there's a public

interest in reducing the volume of that stuff?

5

MR. ENNIS:

It depends on the way it's pursued.

6

The FE -- the Federal Government has adopted regulations

7

for telemarketing which have an opt-out provision.

8

don't like getting that stuff, you can opt out.

9

QUESTION:

What about opt in?

I mean,

If you

I was

10

struck in the brief that says, well,

11

really worried about improper use of this, say in future

12

employment, at the moment of arrest he can check off the

13

box, but it seems to me if you're really interested in

14

recognizing that interest, you would say, opt in.

15

if the arrestee is

If you want to get this kind of stuff from the

16

lawyers and everything, opt in, but unless you

17

affirmatively opt in, we are going to spare you the

18

invasion of privacy, the potential for misuse of this

19

information to curtail your opportunities.

20

MR. ENNIS:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, here, the

21

statute doesn't do either.

It doesn't have an opt out, or

22

it doesn't have an opt in.

Either one would be better

23

than --

24
25

QUESTION:

Yes, but do you think an opt in would

be okay?

MR. ENNIS:

1

Two terms ago when this Court

2

decided a cable indecency case it found that an opt-in

3

provision unduly burdened First Amendment rights, whereas

4

an opt-out provision would not, so an opt-in provision is

5

more constitutionally suspect, but even that would be far

6

better than what this scheme is.

7

QUESTION:

How do we know we're talk -- I mean,

8

I'm a little worried about the fact that these are people

9

arrested for crimes.

I don't know that we're talking

10

about junk mail at all, and I don't know that in a serious

11

case that's the concern, and it might well be that in

12

cases that are quite serious, and addresses are very

13

important for reasons other than junk mail, the newspapers

14

would act in a manner that the police department would

15

consider "responsible," but commercial enterprises might

16

continue.

Now, that seems a possible analysis.

MR. ENNIS:

QUESTION:

19

MR. ENNIS:

Let me get back to -Yes.
-- answering your prior question, if

20

I could, first, Justice Breyer, the, basically what I

21

described as the compensating benefits view that, well,

22

there are benefits to letting the public learn about

23

addressee information.

I think this Court has already rejected that
compensating benefits analysis in both Greater New Orleans

Broadcasting, and in Discovery itself, where the same

2

argument was made.

3

protected speech than commercial speech.

It's a greater benefit to have fully

In Greater New Orleans Broadcasting, the

4
5

Government allowed advertising by Government casinos and

6

Indian casinos on the ground that that would further the

7

compensating benefit of governmental autonomy and revenue

8

generation for those governmental units, but this Court

9

pointed out that that did not mean that the statute did

10

not undermine the justification for its purpose, which was

11

decreasing advertising about gambling.

12

QUESTION:

But Mr. Ennis, that was --

13

MR. ENNIS:

The same is true here.

Every single

14

time there's an increase in public understanding about

15

addressee addresses, there's a corresponding decrease in

16

address privacy, which is the ostensible justification.

MR. ENNIS:

Justice Ginsburg, that's exactly

2

what was at issue in Seattle Times v. Rhinehart, which is

3

why I raised that case.

4

In Seattle Times, the media did not have the

5

information.

6

we will compel the opposing party to give you the

7

information, but only if you use it only for purposes of

8

litigation and not for general publication.

9

without that condition, they wouldn't have gotten the

10

information, the same as our case, and this Court did

11

apply intermediate scrutiny there.

12

13
14

They tried to get it.

QUESTION:

The Government said,

They --

But the Court also said that there's

no right of access, and it cited Zemel.
MR. ENNIS:

Chief Justice Rehnquist, we do not

15

have to establish a raw right of access in order to

prevail in this case.

governmentally approved purposes,

MR. ENNIS:

everybody to get the name, occupation, and date of birth,

25

current address for data bank purposes.
Second, Justice Souter asked about the intrinsic

2

3

value of this speech.

4

value, because it identifies the precise person named John

5

Jones who has been arrested and charged with a particular

6

crime.

7

clear by the fact that newspapers publish the address

8

information.

9

I think that it has intrinsic

The fact that it's not just instrumental is made

QUESTION:

Sure, but isn't the

10

instrumental/intrinsic value distinction one which

11

ultimately dissolves?

12

MR. ENNIS:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. ENNIS:

I think it does.
Yes.
I mentioned that the scheme plainly

15

fails the fourth prong of the Central Hudson test because

16

there is an opt-out alternative.

17

United States don't even discuss that.

18

why would it not be sufficient to allow arrestees to opt

19

out, as the same statute allows victims to opt out.

20

don't discuss it because there's no answer to it.

21

The petitioner and the
They don't say,

They

I finally want to say that they've also raised

22

at the last minute a discrimination argument.

That

23

argument does not stop discrimination by employers if they

24

get the address information from newspapers or private

25

investigators.

Furthermore, the name and date of birth

1

would be sufficient for most employers, who are going to

2

track potential employees by name, to discriminate against

3

them.

4

Third, it's an entirely speculative

5

justification, no evidence in the record to support it

6

and, finally, the Government could directly prohibit the

7

use of this information by anyone to discriminate in

8

employment, and that would not be a speech restriction.
