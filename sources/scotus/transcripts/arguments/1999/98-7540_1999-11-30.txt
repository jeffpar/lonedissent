ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. BERNSTEIN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. BERNSTEIN:

9

May it please the Court:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

10

The respondent effectively asked this Court to

11

uphold, for the first time in its history, a retroactive

12

change in the substantive criminal law.

13

497 U.S. at 45, and Miller, 482 U.S. at 433 and 434,

14

indicate that the Court has never and should never approve

15

a retroactive change in the criminal law.
QUESTION:

16

Why do you call this a change in the

17

substantive law, Mr. Bernstein, rather than a change in

18

the evidentiary rules?
MR. BERNSTEIN:

19

Well, I think both precedent and

20

history indicate that it's a change in the substantive

21

law.

22

brief, is a statute about, quote -- about when, quote, a

23

conviction is supportable, closed quote.

24

clearly, by its own terms, a sufficiency of the evidence

25

statute and not a mere evidentiary rule.

The statute itself, which appears at page 2 of our

So, it is

KM was capable of testifying before the change

in the statute and after the change in the statute.

question was whether her testimony was sufficient by

itself.

There's perhaps no more --

QUESTION:

7

The

Well, it was sort of a witness

competency statute, wasn't it?

8

MR. BERNSTEIN:

9

QUESTION:

I -- I don't believe --

I mean, that's what it's dealing

10

with.

The witness was a witness before and after, but

11

would Texas allow that witness to be a competent witness?
MR. BERNSTEIN:

12

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

13

I don't believe it was any more a witness competency

14

change than the change in Fenwick's case, which is what

15

Calder's fourth category referred to.

16

QUESTION:

Well, I thought it was pretty close

17

to Hopt where -- where convicted felons were originally

18

not considered competent to testify, and then there was a

19

change and they were.

20

MR. BERNSTEIN:

21

QUESTION:

Well --

And someone would have been convicted

22

after the change but not before if that's the only

23

witness.

MR. BERNSTEIN:

Well, as Hopt makes clear, it

four times distinguishes changes in sufficiency of the

issue, wasn't it?
MR. BERNSTEIN:

6

Yes.

Hopt was and this is not.

7

In Texas, a 5-year-old can testify and is sufficient by

8

themselves under the old statute, as well as under the new

9

statute.

One would not suggest that a 14-year-old is less

10

competent than a 5-year-old.

11

of the evidence every bit as much as the rule of two

12

witnesses for treason in Fenwick's case went to

sufficiency.

QUESTION:

The rule goes to sufficiency

15

statute, talks about the testimony being corroborated or

16

not - -

MR. BERNSTEIN:

QUESTION:

20

That's correct.

-- which is exactly what the -- some

of the other witness competency statutes talk about.
MR. BERNSTEIN:

I -- I don't believe so.

I

21

believe the witness competency cases went to whether the

22

person could testify at all, not whether the testimony had

23

to be corroborated.

24

common law rule that you can't convict someone on their

Now, would you

Wasn't the -- the prior rule in Fenwick, which

11

MR. BERNSTEIN:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

That, it seems to me, is not the kind

3

of rule that we have here because, as I read the -- the

4

prior Texas statute, it didn't require a second witness to

5

the sexual act.

6

that corroboration, for example, might be the testimony of

7

a -- of a doctor who would examine the victim afterwards

and -- and so on.

It simply required corroboration, and

So, if -- if the -- if your argument is that

Fenwick situation, that seems wrong to me.

MR. BERNSTEIN:

Sure.

Could you

The rule stated in

24

Calder's fourth category is broader than simply a change

25

from a two-witness rule to a one-witness rule.

MR. BERNSTEIN:

8

9

It is certainly written broader.

Well, you do need a second

witness here in that some form of corroboration --

But not a witness -- not an eye

MR. BERNSTEIN:

12

Well, the -- there's a split in

13

the Texas courts as to whether you need an eye witness.

Two courts suggest you need an eye witness, and three

-- to get the evidence in.
So, under the old rule, the

testimony of KM was not sufficient by itself.

at least somebody else to come in and corroborate whatever

6

corroboration means under Texas law --

QUESTION:

MR. BERNSTEIN:

You needed

Yes.

that there was a timely outcry.
QUESTION:

10

What about -- what about the

11

corroboration here that the -- the defendant himself

12

passed that note to his wife, adultery with KM?
MR. BERNSTEIN:

13

Well, we believe the

14

corroboration issue, for purposes of this Court, has been

15

waived.

16

corroboration was not argued below by the State of Texas,

17

and Calder v. Kentucky would indicate that when an

18

argument has not been raised below, the respondent cannot

raise it here.

Well, what about as a matter of Texas

thing?

2

Can you answer that question yes or

no?
MR. BERNSTEIN:

3

There are two Texas cases that

4

indicate eye witness corroboration is required.

those were the Texas rule, that would not be sufficient.

Presumably the defendant is an

eye witness.

Under other Texas cases, that

eye witness.

11

Well --

would be.

So, if

QUESTION:

And he has said, adultery with KM.

Why isn't that good enough?

15

MR. BERNSTEIN:

Well, I think the principal

16

reason it's not good enough is because the issue was not

17

waived below.
QUESTION:

18

Well, but as I say, I'm not -- I'm

19

not talking about what's before us in this particular ex

20

post facto issue, but I'm trying to get some feel for

21

exactly what the Texas statute requires.
MR. BERNSTEIN:

22

It -- it might well be good

23

enough.

There is a split in the Texas courts, and that

24

particular situation has not been presented.

25

addition, there were many counts alleged here, and that 9

And in

1

- that note wouldn't necessarily go to these four counts,

2

as opposed to the more recent counts which do not fall

3

within the ex post facto challenge.
QUESTION:

4

Mr. Bernstein, would the argument

5

you're making carry over to a case where the evidentiary

6

rule that was changed was the rule that a defendant could

7

bring up the victim's past sexual conduct?
MR. BERNSTEIN:

8

9

No, it would not, Your Honor.

Hopt has made clear, as did Collins in a footnote, that

10

mere changes in evidentiary rules do not fall within

11

Calder's fourth category.

12

you described would not be a change in a sufficiency of

13

the evidence rule.

14

what evidence could be admitted.

That would not -- the situation

It would just be a change in -- in

It would also be like Thompson v. Missouri in

15
16

that regard, which admitted documents which had not --

17

which would not have been authenticatable under the prior

18

rule.

19

Admittedly, the distinction here is a fine one

20

between sufficiency of the evidence, on the one hand,

21

which is substantive, which we submit cannot be changed

22

retroactively, and evidentiary rules on the other hand.

23

But it is a distinction recognized in every pertinent body

24

of the law.

25

the evidence is substantive, but evidentiary rules

It's recognized in Erie where sufficiency of

1

themselves are only procedural.
It's recognized in Conflicts of Law, and I would

2

3

refer the Court to Restatement Second, Conflicts of Law,

4

section 133 and 134, comments B to each, where sufficiency

5

of the evidence is recognized as substantive.
And it's -- this distinction between sufficiency

6

7

of the evidence and evidence is also recognized in double

8

jeopardy law in this Court's leading opinion in Lockhart

9

v. Nelson.

10

This Court has never suggested, in either the

11

civil or the criminal context, that sufficiency of the

12

evidence is procedural and not substantive.

13

substantive because it is intertwined, inextricably

14

intertwined, with the very question of guilt.

15

QUESTION:

And it is

But when you say -- as you say, the

16

line is very difficult to draw.

17

someone is tried for treason and only one witness

18

testifies to an overt act?

19

a failure of the case for sufficiency of the evidence?

20

MR. BERNSTEIN:

How about the case where

Is that an evidentiary rule or

Well, the Fenwick's defenders -

21

- and we submitted yesterday a lodging of relevant pages

22

of the debate in Fenwick's case -- specifically took the

23

position that a change in the required number of witnesses

24

was a substantive change equivalent to a change in the

25

offense itself and specifically said that such a change in

2

the minimum amount of proof was an ex post facto change.
Essentially -- it's interesting -- 303 years

3

later, we're having the same argument here that the

4

English Parliament had in 1696 because the arguments

5

raised by my colleagues from Texas that a change in the -

6

- in the minimum amount of proof is simply procedural and

7

simply a matter of form were made by Fenwick's accusers.

8

9

QUESTION:

But Fenwick's case was very much a

bill of attainder, was it not?

10

MR. BERNSTEIN:

11

attainder, but it was --

12

14

QUESTION:

No.

I think --it was a bill of

They were out to get him.

They

weren't changing the general law.
MR. BERNSTEIN:

It was a bill of attainder, but

15

it was also an ex post facto situation.

And the debates

16

that we provided the Court with yesterday in the lodging

17

make that clear, particularly on pages 255 and 256, 262,

18

282, and 283, 312, and 320.

19

Fenwick -- the accusers of Fenwick took the State of

20

Texas' position, but the defenders of Fenwick, who I think

21

the court of history has sided with and who certainly

22

Calder and Justice Story sided with in his Commentaries on

23

the Constitution -- the defenders of Fenwick said changing

24

the minimum sufficiency of the evidence is a substantive

25

change and is equivalent to making a new crime, is

They say, the defenders of

1

equivalent to changing the offense.
And that makes sense from a policy reason as

2

3

well because one of the key policies of the Ex Post Facto

4

Clause is to keep the legislature out of the business of

5

adjudication.

6

could do to more put its thumb on the scale than to change

7

the standard for determining guilt.
And I would cite the Court to one other case.

8
9

And there's nothing that the legislature

In Miller v. Florida, the issue there was the standard for

10

determining sentence.

11

have gotten the exact same sentence under the old statute.

12

The only thing that changed was the legislature put its

13

thumb on the scale and said, we're going to make it easier

14

to give the longer sentence.

15

QUESTION:

The defendant in that case could

19

needed something more.

20

there were all kinds of rules ranking witnesses in terms

21

of their thought of credibility, like two Jews equal one

22

Christian.

23

What the Texas law did was to make a witness fully
You

And in the old days, you know,

It seems to me that that's -- that's the kind of

24

rule we're dealing with here.

MR. BERNSTEIN:

3

Well, but the same would have

4

been true in Fenwick's case.

The single witness was

recognized as not fully competent by himself to sustain a

conviction.

And I agree with you, Justice Ginsburg.

9

bad policy choice.

The old

But the point is it was wrong as a

substantive policy choice.

11

teaches is when a legislature changes its substantive

12

policy choices, it must change them prospectively and not

13

retrospectively.

14

QUESTION:

And what ex post facto law

But I don't see how you can call it

Absolutely.

If this -- under

the old statute, if there had been a second witness, ready

There is still a corroboration

or outcry requirement for those above 18.
QUESTION:

I don't know whether to think about

this as a witness -- as a witness qualification case, in

which case I guess you'd have a hard time, or to think of

it as a change in the amount of proof case, which is what

you're arguing.

It seems to me

in Collins we said that -- that that distinction is not
very useful, didn't we?
MR. BERNSTEIN:

I think Collins was addressing

something else.

A number of earlier cases had suggested

5

that procedural rules, if they provided substantial

protection -- in other words, a lot of protection, if they

helped a lot, if they worked a lot to the advantage of the

defendant -- were not covered by the Ex Post Facto Clause.

But the Court in Collins, I believe at page 45, made clear

that substantive rules -- and I realize the two words are

different category than procedural rules that help a lot.

But, Mr. Bernstein, if the -- one of

the prime bases, I think you would agree, for the ex post

Now, here there can't be any

He couldn't have anticipated that the child wasn't going

MR. BERNSTEIN:

It is correct, Your Honor, that

one of the important concerns is reliance, and it is also

correct that we do not raise a reliance argument.

the only concern.

QUESTION:

But here, Mr. Bernstein, unlike the

2

Fenwick case where they wanted to get this person, there's

3

no indication that any -- that the legislature was doing

anything but updating its rules of evidence, bringing them

5

in line with the more modern trend.

6

MR. BERNSTEIN:

I would agree, Your Honor,

7

there's no indication that they wanted to get Carmeli, but

8

I believe that the clause and the purpose of the clause,

9

especially as rephrased by Justice Story, goes to a change

10

in a rule of sufficiency of the evidence that -- that

category four is not limited to attainder cases.

12

think the citations that we gave to Fenwick's debates --

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

The State of Texas respectfully submits that

this Court cannot reverse Carmeli's convictions at issue

14

here today consistent with Collins v. Youngblood, which

15

this Court decided just 9 years ago.

16

in Collins, the language in category four of the Calder

17

formulation by Justice Chase was not intended to prohibit

application of new evidentiary rules in trials for crimes

committed before the changes, citing this Court's decision

They included not just an

be violated if the criminal prohibition was later

Yes, Your Honor.

that looking in historical context, it appears to have

been aimed at the situation of a bill of attainder, and

18

some bill of attainders are Ex Post Facto Clauses -- may

that bill of attainder also had an ex post facto effect to

Ms. Brinkmann, one of the problems

offense, which you -- we all agree cannot be changed, and

a kind of -- let's call it -- a corroborative requirement

because when there is a corroborative requirement there,

in effect what the law says is you've got to prove

something extra.

You've got to prove that there is a

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD D. BERNSTEIN

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14

MR. BERNSTEIN:

Justice Souter, the point you

15

were making is exactly the point that Fenwick's defenders

16

made in the lodging that we filed yesterday.

17

made exactly the point that they viewed changing the

18

minimum evidence as akin to changing the crime itself, as

19

akin to changing the elements.

20

Justice Stevens,

And they

I think you're correct that

21

this rule could be limited to crime-specific minimum

22

standards of evidence.

23

specific treason minimum standard of evidence, and in the

24

-- in the Restatement Second, Conflicts of Law, minimum

clearest case where it's substantive, where -- where it
