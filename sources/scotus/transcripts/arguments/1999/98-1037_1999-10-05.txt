ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAROL F. JORSTAD

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MS. JORSTAD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case concerns one of the hardy perennials

10

of American law, what to do with a meritless criminal

11

appeal when that appeal is brought by an appointed lawyer

12

on behalf of an indigent client, and what the standard of

13

reversal in such cases should be.

14

This Court addressed the problem in Anders v.

15

California, holding that the indigent appellant in that

16

case had his equal protection and due process rights to

17

counsel on appeal violated by California's conclusory no­

18

merit letter.

19

Anders has two component parts.

The first is

20

the identification of the constitutional rights at stake,

21

and the second is the setting forth of a procedure by

22

which those rights can be vindicated.

23

thinks that the Anders framework, the second part, is

24

compulsory.

25

Ninth Circuit's insistence on rigid, programmatic

We think not.

The Ninth Circuit

In fact, we believe that the

1

adherence to that procedure has undermined California's

2

legitimate efforts to provide effective assistance to

3

indigent appellants.

4

The second issue is whether the Strickland test

5

for ineffective assistance should apply to meritless

6

indigent appeals.

7

against extreme malfunctions in the State procedure.

8

Ordinarily, Federal courts presume the regularity of State

9

court judgments, but not in no-merit cases.

Federal habeas is intended to guard

In those

10

cases, prejudice is presumed.

11

because it is altogether too one-sided, and because it

12

turns the presumption of regularity on its head.

13

This is presents problems,

A presumption of prejudice should be reserved

14

for cases where the error is so systemic that it's

15

impossible to judge what the harm is, and the examples

16

given generally are those of judicial bias and actual

17

denial of counsel.

18

We urge that Strickland be adopted to bring this

19

one anomalous situation into conformity with other cases

20

where deficient performance by counsel is urged.

21

QUESTION:

Ms. Jorstad, the problem that I have

22

with that is not a theoretical problem, but kind of a

23

practical one, and that is this, that if we require a

24

demonstration of Strickland prejudice at the habeas stage,

25

once there's been found to be an Anders violation, if we

1

require the demonstration of Strickland prejudice at that

2

stage, as a practical matter, what we are going to do is

3

require the argument of the appeal in the first instance

4

in a Federal court.

5

And number 1, that's going to take some serious

6

time, and the oddity -- when you get to standing on head

7

argument, the oddity is that you're going to have your

8

appeal argued in the first instance in a Federal court,

9

whereas in the first instance it shouldn't be, so for

10

pragmatic reasons it seems to me that there's an argument

11

that it makes a lot of sense to say that once you have

12

shown the Anders violation, and let's say, to go -- I'd go

13

this far for the sake of argument.

14

Once you've shown that there's a possibility

15

that there could be a difference, that there might be some

16

merit, that's as much as you should require, or in effect

17

you're going to turn Federal courts in habeas cases on

18

Anders into State appellate courts.

19

MS. JORSTAD:

Justice Souter, I believe that

20

that's not an overall concern.

21

in the context of merits briefs, where counsel raises one

22

or two or three issues, but fails to raise one or two or

23

three others, the Federal courts are in much the same

24

position.

25

I think if we look at this

They're going to have to look -- in a Strickland

1

context, there is no presumption of prejudice, but in a

2

Strickland context they're going to have to look at these

3

other issues that will be asserted on Federal habeas, and

4

of course, they should have been exhausted in State court

5

as well, so it won't be the first time.

6

QUESTION:

Ms. Jorstad, doesn't the strength of

7

your second argument on the prejudice and so forth from

8

Strickland depend to a certain extent on whether we agree

9

with you that the constitutional rights for the appellants

10

discussed in Anders do not require that the particular

11

Anders remedy be etched in stone, that other remedies

12

would be equally effective?

13

somewhat the outcome of the Strickland analysis in the

14

second prong?

15

MS. JORSTAD:

Isn't that going to influence

Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice.

16

Our position on this matter is that the first component of

17

Anders, that is, the rights to be vindicated, is strictly

18

constitutional.

19

assistance, and can always be raised in Federal court.

20

The second part of Anders, this prophylactic

It goes to effective or ineffective

21

framework, is not constitutional.

This is a matter of

22

pragmatic suggestion by the court in Anders, and we

23

believe that these rights can be vindicated.

24

what we're talking about is effective assistance of

25

counsel, we're talking about equal protection, and to a

After all,

1

lesser extent, due process, and the laboratory of the

2

States should be allowed to develop these procedures in

3

ways that make sense in those States, as long as they

4

vindicate the underlying rights.

5

QUESTION:

Do you believe as a general

6

proposition that, if this Court identifies a

7

constitutional violation, and says the way this violation

8

is to be avoided in the future is to follow steps A, B,

9

and C, that any court, State or Federal for that matter,

10

is free to say, well, we really don't like A, B, and C,

11

we'll try C, D, and F?

12

Do you believe that the lower courts are free,

13

when we have come up with a pragmatic constitutional

14

solution and says, this is the way it is to be avoided,

15

are they free to ignore that?

16

MS. JORSTAD:

I certainly don't think that any

17

court is free to ignore this Court, but I would say that

18

lower Federal courts certainly seem to me to be obliged,

19

because of this Court's supervisory powers in addition to

20

its constitutional jurisdiction, to follow whatever

21

procedure this Court sets forth, but it has been the

22

custom over many, many years for State courts to have some

23

flexibility in interpreting this Court's procedural

24

suggestions --

QUESTION:

Do you think this Court is free to

interpret its own opinions to decide that perhaps a

2

suggestion in the opinion, or a formula, was not mandatory

3

but could be replaced by an equally acceptable one?

4

MS. JORSTAD:

5

QUESTION:

6

I do, Mr. Chief Justice.

I do.

But if it is mandatory, what's your

answer then?

7

MS. JORSTAD:

But if it is mandatory?

If it is

8

mandatory, if, in fact, this Court said what it meant and

9

meant what it said in Anders, and if this court holds that

10

as a matter of constitutional law that procedure were

11

required, then California is not in compliance.
QUESTION:

12

I thought we -- we don't mandate

13

anything.

14

prescriptions.

15

the only holding in the actual case was that what occurred

16

there did not comply with the Constitution.

We're not like a legislature.

We don't issue

I suppose the only real holding in Anders,

17

MS. JORSTAD:

18

QUESTION:

I would agree with that.

And the further statement that in

19

order to comply with the Constitution you have to do this,

20

this, this, and this can be regarded as dictum, which you

21

would be well-advised, if you're a lower court, to follow,

22

but I'm not sure that a legislature has the obligation to

23

follow that prescription as though we were laying down a

24

prescription.

25

We decided in Anders that what occurred there

1

did not provide effective assistance of counsel.
MS. JORSTAD:

2

Yes, Your Honor.

In fact, what

3

was decided in Anders was that it didn't provide counsel

4

at all and, of course, Anders antedated Strickland by 17

5

years, so there was no real test for prejudice in that

6

case.

7

California took Anders very seriously, and so --

8

and People v. Feggans followed it very, very closely, but

9

over time, things changed, and what has happened in the

10

last 32 years and even less, really, is that California's

11

system for providing representation to indigents has

12

become more and more sophisticated, has become more

13

established.

14

This is not a situation any longer.

There is no

15

indigent in the State of California who will be

16

represented by some solo lawyer who crawls out of the

17

woodwork.

Everybody is responsible to the Appellate

18

Projects.

The Appellate Projects actually seek out

19

lawyers, they train them, they match lawyers --

20

QUESTION:

Well, but I guess -- why don't you

21

help us understand what the California procedure is.

22

lawyer there representing an indigent defendant can

23

find -- can conclude that he finds no valid grounds for

24

overturning the appeal, and just write something to the

25

court saying that, but not asking to withdraw, and not

MS. JORSTAD:

think that's --

7

QUESTION:

I thought what happened here was that

3

the lawyer found no grounds that he thought justified

9

going further, and so advised the California courts, and

10

did not ask to withdraw, and did not point out any so-

11

called arguable issues.
MS. JORSTAD:

12

If I may recap, that's I guess

13

correct as far as it goes, but there are other aspects to

14

it.

15

When the lawyer has decided that there's no

16

merit to the brief, and when his appellate supervisor, his

17

Appellate Project supervisor, who's an expert, concurs, he

18

may file a brief under California procedure in which he

19

sets forth a detailed statement of the case and statement

20

of the facts with citations to the record which help the

21

court to know that the record has been read and

22

considered.

23

In the record, in the brief filed in this

24

particular case, counsel mentioned in his statement of the

25

case that there had been a Faretta motion, that the

In California they're

In addition, you're correct in saying, Justice

O'Connor, that he does not withdraw, and he asks the

14

of Wende, is that an independent review by the court is

required.

QUESTION:

The idea here is to have the

Now, does the appellate -- does the

17

counsel for the Appellate Project continue to participate

18

at that point, or does he stand aside, just as the

19

attorney stood aside?

20

In other words, the retained attorney consults

the lawyer for the California Appellate Project, and that

lawyer concurs with the judgment that there should be a

California system is that the effort is to have the

in the context of a brief that's decided -- that they

I think the main thing to be aware of in the

QUESTION:

There's something like

Yes, but the thing I wonder -- I

8

think California has a pretty good system, frankly, and if

9

I were designing one, maybe it would be California's, but

10

the problem that I see is that we have an adversary

11

system, basically, in the country and Anders says, you

12

have a right to a lawyer, criminal defendant, and you have

13

a right, as part of that, to have the lawyer think through

14

on appeal what are his best arguments.

15

Now, we want him to go through that process,

16

write down what his best arguments are, and if he thinks

17

they're still no good, tell us why.

18

it is to be an advocate, and that's part of what it is to

19

be a lawyer, and that's part of a right to a lawyer that

20

you have.

21

That's part of what

Now, given our adversarial system, why not?
MS. JORSTAD:

Your Honor, first of all I would

22

say that I certainly agree that the -- that any appellant

23

has a right to a conscientious and diligent lawyer who

24

looks for issues.

apparently concluded that there were some issues that

ought to be raised and litigated.

MS. JORSTAD:

Nobody -- well, first of all, I

would have to say that there have been two issues raised

10

in this context, and I think both of them are, frankly,

11

the definition of frivolousness.

horribles that he would face if he went pro per.

QUESTION:

But wasn't the issue -- not the

20

original Faretta, but later in the proceeding it is

QUESTION:

I would like to add that -Can you tell us -- take us through,

because I want to get to Justice Breyer's question again,

staff or a justice reviews the entire record from scratch.

earlier theme, that it only really makes sense to talk

about an adversary system if there is some basis for

for what it does, and sometimes, in writing out those

won't write, so the discipline that a lawyer has to go

me is, the notion that there is a judge who's going to

might be, we're talking here about the right to counsel,

2

and we're talking about mostly equal protection.

3

If you analyze this as a matter of equal

4

protection, it would simply never be true.

I can say

5

categorically that retained counsel would have to explain

6

to the court why he failed to raise the issues he doesn't

7

raise, nor would appointed counsel, who raises -- you

8

know, even if counsel in a merits brief raises a single

9

extremely marginal issue, that counsel would never have to

10

say to the court, here are the other issues I considered,

11

and here are the cases that say why they're no good.

12

just doesn't happen.

13

It

What I'm suggesting is that we do have --

14

Justice Ginsburg, you said, trust me, and I think we

15

should afford similar trust to lawyers who write no-merit

16

briefs that we give to lawyers who write merits briefs,

17

and specifically I would point out that under the current

18

system it takes a lot of courage to write a no-merit

19

brief.

20

Now, first of all, I would also add that it's not as

21

if the lawyer who presents a no-merit brief can just kind

22

of write it off and hand it in and go away with his money.

23

He has to justify himself to the Appellate Project.

I would suggest to the Court that what California does is

importantly, found a single issue which resulted in the

2

reversal of a count, a big mistake.

3

Now, Penson I think would have come out the same

4

way if there had been a Strickland test as a presumption

5

of prejudice, but it's very, very different, because in

6

Penson the, really the largest fault was the court's, and

7

that is in failing to appoint counsel once they knew that

8

the first counsel had missed big, arguable issues.

9

would never happen in California.

That

In California -- and it

10

was in Penson the State reviewing board itself which found

11

the errors and failed to appoint counsel.

12

In California, if a State -- if the State court

13

finds that there are issues that should have been raised,

14

even counsel who has not yet been dismissed, or a new

counsel in some cases will be appointed and has to brief

those issues.

QUESTION:

MS. JORSTAD:

Well, I can't speak for the entire

5

bitterly about the amount of time -- I mean, they're not

6

happy, all of them, to be doing this work.

7

QUESTION:

Ms. Jorstad, wouldn't it be helpful

8

to the court to have an explanation of arguable issues and

9

why they were rejected?

I mean, if I were assigned the

10

task of going over these records, I would think that would

11

be a good starting point for me.

12

California is resisting having such a system.

13

MS. JORSTAD:

I'm just surprised that

Well, Your Honor, it's

14

interesting, because both sides of the -- not both sides

15

of the bench, but both sides of the bar, both the people

16

and the defense, feel the same way about this.

17

I think that when you talk about having reasons

18

stated to the Court for issues that have been rejected,

19

again we need to look at what constitutional interest

20

would be satisfied by that.

21

If we're talking about the Sixth Amendment, or

about equal protection, I don't think that that answers

those things at all, because in fact a client --

Projects, and that duty is delegated by the courts, don't

have enormous case loads, at least from the Appellate

I would like to begin by making three points.

First, both the district court and the Ninth Circuit

QUESTION:

As the Warden concedes, it

Well, Mr. Nessim, supposing that

15

under a State which follows the Anders rules, an Anders

16

brief is filed, but -- and the State -- the Federal court

17

finds that there was some issue that should have been

18

raised, what does the Federal court -- can the Federal

1

court examine that on habeas, and if it does find an issue

20

should have been raised, what is the remedy?

21

MR. NESSIM:

I believe the remedy should be

22

prejudice per se, Your Honor, because the Federal court

23

will not be guided by the advocacy process, would not be

24

able -- does not have the information, would have to

25

speculate, as this Court has repeatedly found, to make

1

that determination without an advocate's presentation, if

2

there's a finding of an arguable issue that a merits brief

3

is required.
If there's no finding -- if -- the Federal court

4
5

may not be in a position to decide if there's an arguable

6

issue with an inadequate merits brief or an Anders brief.

7

If there's no adequate brief that refers to the issues,

8

the court only has the cold record, and this Court has

9

repeatedly found that that is insufficient for the court

10

to make its determination.
QUESTION:

11

Well, talk about consuming time,

12

though.

I mean, here the lawyer in the State court on

13

appeal filed a no-merits brief under Anders, and you say

14

the Federal district court, it doesn't have to decide that

15

there actually was any error in the State court

16

proceedings, but only that there was an arguable issue,

17

and then what, it goes back to the State court to have

18

another argument on an arguable issue, without ever

19

finding any constitutional infirmity in the trial.

20

does seem going around Robin Hood's barn.
MR. NESSIM:

21

That

Well, I think Anders is an

22

efficient procedure.

It requires the lawyer to act as an

23

advocate.

24

determination whether the appeal is wholly frivolous,

25

which is constitutionally required, without the assistance

The Federal habeas court is unable to make the

SUITE 400

1

of an advocate and, as I think a question was asked during

2

the Warden's presentation, it's efficient to have the

3

State court make the determination in the first instance.

4

The Federal court's determination was, was there

5

a denial to right to counsel, and this Court has

6

repeatedly found a right to counsel on the first appeal as

7

of right.

8

while Anders may not be mandatory in the case of post

9

conviction or discretionary appeals, it is mandatory where

10
11

In fact, Pennsylvania v. Findley assumes that

there is such a underlying constitutional right.
QUESTION:

That's a different question.

I'd be

12

awfully worried about -- I agree with the Chief Justice

13

that, suppose -- what you're saying is, if lawyer A, who's

14

a good lawyer, perfectly good, it's not inadequate

15

assistance, brings an appeal and leaves out issue 1 in the

16

State court and argues the rest of it.

17

It's waived, unless it was inadequate assistance of

18

counsel, which I assume it wasn't.

19

Issue 1 is gone.

You're saying lawyer A did exactly the same

20

thing, but not having found any other issues, he files an

21

Anders brief, which in every other respect is fine, and

22

under those circumstances we have two more procedures, 1)

23

the procedure in habeas court where the habeas judge says,

24

I guess it's arguable, you should have raised it, and then

25

back we go to State court, and this time it wasn't waived.

Now, trying to reconcile that's impossible in my

1
2

mind.
MR. NESSIM:

3

In answer to your question, Anders

4

requires that there be an advocate on appeal.

In most

5

cases it will be a merits brief, but if the lawyer is

6

unable to do that because of ethical reasons, it requires

7

an Anders brief, and in Penson this Court distinguished

8

the situation between where a lawyer acts as an advocate

9

but acts ineffectively, in which case there's not a

10

presumed prejudice standard, and the situation where there

11

is no advocate at all, and we would submit there was no

12

advocate at all here, because a proper Anders brief was

13

filed.

14

our brief, not one of those are even hinted at.

2

worrying me, so I want to know your response to that.
MR. NESSIM:

Your Honor, the aspect of Anders

3

which was criticized in California is the aspect of the

4

independent judicial review, which is independently

5

required by California law.

6

one of the two issues they face, they interpret Anders as

7

requiring that.

8

9

The Wende case that's in fact

We would submit to you that the California
system, while certain aspects of it are good, and there's

10

no reason that they can't stay under what we promote, they

11

can still have this appellate project system.

12

I would add that most of the facts concerning

13

that system are not in the record of this case, which was

14

pointed out in one of the amicus files, but more

15

importantly -- and I think this is crystal clear -- while

16

this case should be decided under Federal constitutional

17

law, the Warden has mischaracterized the California

18

system, and I would refer you to In re Sade C, an opinion

19

of the California supreme court, which does not purport to

20

break any new ground.

21

It just refers the precedents which were in

22

effect, and it says that Wende -- and I'm referring to

23

page 787 of actually the 55 Cal. Rptr. 2d version, but

24

Wende made clear that in such a situation all the steps

25

specified by Anders had to be taken, other than those

dependent on filing a motion to withdraw.
The implicit rationale is that for present

3

purposes substantial withdrawal is equivalent to formal

withdrawal, and in the footnote there it says that the

Oregon court erred in finding that an Anders brief which

6

referred to issues was not required.

7

So our position is, first of all Federal

constitutional law controls, but there is no contrary

California system.

If this Court looks at footnote 8 and

11

ground, it just refers to California law.

MR. NESSIM:

That, I

You are correct, Your Honor.

In

fact, Penson, explicitly after discussing the two purposes

9

I discussed, said that a third purpose said that it

10

provides an independent inducement to counsel to do what

11

Douglas requires, which is to diligently review the

12

record, research the law, and by putting pen to paper,

13

with that discipline you're much more likely to find an

14

arguable issue than you would if you didn't engage in that

15

process, so it does provide an independent inducement.

16

QUESTION:

But the lawyer in Anders, in the

17

Anders procedure, need not follow the final step outlined

by Justice Breyer, which is to say why these arguments are

frivolous.

1

That's right.

Anders is not only

2

constitutionally required, it's an efficient system.

3

What's being complained about by some practitioners or

4

judges in California is the failure to file an Anders

5

brief, because the court then is just left with a cold

6

record, and is forced to do the whole thing itself.

7

QUESTION:

What about the appellate process?

8

QUESTION:

On that point, Justice Stevens and I

9

were both interested in the brief filed by the retired

10

justices.

11

there is a constitutional deficiency in the California

12

procedure, or that they just prefer the old procedure as a

13

policy matter?

14

Do you interpret this brief as saying that

How do you interpret the brief?

MR. NESSIM:

Yes.

Your Honor, I interpret the

15

brief as the judges' commenting on policy, not

16

constitutionality.

17

that their statement is to, in a sense, agree with the

18

Warden that the California system, which is practiced at

19

least in some parts of California, is the correct system.

20

I think they're talking about the policy.

21

I disagree with the Warden's statement

And with respect to the CAP system, as we

pointed out in our brief, most of -- the only thing about

That doesn't indicate that they independently

According to this brief, one of the appellate

caution the Court, none of this is in the record.
Our position is that even if -- 1) it's not in

the record, and 2), even if there was a second attorney

13

who reviewed it, this Court has repeatedly held that is

14

not the substitute of an advocate's brief, and an Anders

15

brief, while a very strange form of advocacy, is still an

16

advocate's brief, and the court needs that.

17

I would point out also that there is a

18

fundamental difference between the Warden's position and

1

our position as to what an arguable issue is.

20

I think would ask counsel to speculate as to, in a sense

21

act as amicus per aes, which was criticized before as to

22

the likely success of an issue.

court of California had approved this system.
MR. NESSIM:

Not at all, Your Honor.

If this

court reads the Wende opinion, there were two questions

raised in Wende, 1) whether the appellate court had to

The Chief Justice in his dissent in Penson

There's plenty of reason to doubt that in this case.
