ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEREMIAH W. NIXON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

GENERAL NIXON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
23 years ago this Court decided in Buckley v.

12

Valeo that a $1,000 campaign contribution limit,

13

applicable to elections for Federal office, was

14

constitutionally valid.

15

across the country have adopted contribution limits

16

relying on that holding.

17

Circuit is a direct challenge to the continuing validity

18

of the Buckley ruling.

19

Legislatures and city councils

The holding of the Eighth

Respondents say that the Court's First Amendment

20

decisions have supplemented Buckley, but this is a thinly

21

veiled contention that the Court should overrule Buckley.

22

Respondents' amici more honestly urge the Court to

23

overrule the contribution holding in Buckley.

24

have not made the convincing showing necessary to depart

25

from settled principles of stare decisis.

QUESTION:

1

Well, what about the inflation

2

argument, General Nixon?

3

campaign limit of contribution enacted instead of in 1974,

4

in the depths of the Depression, and it came up many years

5

later, would you say that that was an attack on stare

6

decisis to say this at this level is too low?

7

GENERAL NIXON:

I mean, supposing we had a

There may be times, Mr. Chief

8

Justice, where the level does get too low, but in this

9

case they've clearly not proven that it's different in

10

kind, nor have they proven the ultimate burden, which is

11

that the speech of candidates in campaigns has been

12

impaired.

13

amount of money expended by candidates has expanded.

14

Consequently, this situation is not the place in which

15

inflation would drive this limit to be unuseful.

16
17
18

To the contrary is true.

With the limits, the

Nothing has happened, either legally or
socially -QUESTION:

Excuse me.

The fact that it's

19

expanded doesn't prove anything.

20

expanded more than that.

21

of the new electronic media that give candidates so much

22

more opportunity to try to reach the public with their

23

views, and it costs a lot of money, so the fact that more

24

money is spent doesn't prove a thing.

25

might have been spent.

I mean, it might have

much speech, but for the campaign limits.
GENERAL NIXON:

It doesn't change their burden,

3

however, Justice Scalia, and their burden is to show that

4

the $1,000 is different in kind, and that speech of a

5

class of candidates has been dramatically impaired.

6

QUESTION:

Well, do you -- is it not the case

7

that the amount of time spent by candidates in the raising

8

of money has radically increased?

9

GENERAL NIXON:

10
11

Many candidates do have to spend

more time, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

An enormous amount of political

12

campaigning consists of so-called fundraisers.

13

not a -- an obvious consequence of the extremely low

14

amount they can get from each individual?

15

GENERAL NIXON:

Is that

If it is, Your Honor, the threat

16

of having candidates on the phone talking to members of

17

their constituency, asking for their help and support,

18

pales in comparison to the risk that the perception of

19

corruption with large contributions raises.

20

QUESTION:

Well, you say perception of

21

corruption.

22

mean the sense that there is a quid pro quo that Mr. Smith

23

gives $5,000 to a legislator and in turn the legislature

24

agrees to do something for Mr. Smith?

25

Precisely what do you mean by that?

GENERAL NIXON:

Do you

1

that it requires a quid pro quo under Buckley in order to

2

have a perception of corruption.

3
4

QUESTION:

Well, but tell me what you mean by

perception of corruption, that phrase.
GENERAL NIXON:

5

Well, corruption is dollars to

6

influence action contrary to what the position of the

7

elected or appointed official would be.

8

corruption is really when the public sees a donor hand a

9

candidate a large amount of money, I mean, it's fanciful

10

to -QUESTION:

11
12

The perception of

Are you convinced that that

perception has diminished since Buckley?

13

(Laughter.)

14

GENERAL NIXON:

15

QUESTION:

No, I'm not, Your Honor, but --

Well, doesn't that make it very

16

important for you to tell us precisely what interest is

17

being served by the Missouri statute?

18

burden is on the petitioner to show that his speech is

19

diminished.

20

had thought the burden was on you to show that there's a

21

subsisting, existing interest that's served by this

22

legislation.

23

Now, you say the

I had thought it was quite the opposite.

GENERAL NIXON:

Your Honor, in the ordinary

24

case, there's a presumption of constitutionality of a

25

statute.

Now, the shift in the burden that occurs when

the First Amendment is at play is halted here, because

2

Missouri passed a statute that mirrors the statute

3

approved by this Court in Buckley.

4

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that because of

5

the holding in Buckley that it's no longer incumbent upon

6

the State to establish the interest that the State has to

7

support this?

8

I think that the -- if you read all the opinions

9

in Buckley, the Court still said the State statute would

10

have to pass rigorous First Amendment scrutiny, and that

11

incorporates establishing what the State purpose is of the

12

legislation and whether it's sufficiently important to

13

justify whatever infringement may exist, so it is

14

important to know exactly what Missouri has put forward to

15

justify the legislation.

16

GENERAL NIXON:

Yes, Your Honor,

it is, and in

17

this case we've put forth powerful testimony, not only the

18

affidavit of the chairman of the committee who held

19

hearings throughout the State and in a bipartisan fashion

20

passed the campaign finance measure that's at play here,

21

but also the plebescite of the people of our State,

22

which 74 percent people strong voted for a limit, one-

23

third the limit of what this limit is.

Evidence of corruption, Your

Honor?
QUESTION:

Corruption or the appearance of

corruption that would arise from allowing a person to give

more than $1,000 to a campaign.

GENERAL NIXON:

QUESTION:

9
10

Do you seriously think there is a

serious risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption
if you allow somebody to give more than $1,000?
GENERAL NIXON:

Your Honor, we would --

I think that

Yes, Your Honor,

And what evidence of that is there in

The affidavit of Senator Goode,

17

the chairman of the committee, that took the testimony

that passed the measure specifically indicates that that

is an important part of their difference.
QUESTION:

20

Did he give instances of where this

21

corruption or appearance of corruption raised its ugly

head?

GENERAL NIXON:

He did not give specific

instances in the affidavit, no, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Did he say what he meant by the

appearance of corruption?
GENERAL NIXON:

3

In that testimony and in that

affidavit he said that corruption, as I indicated before,

Chief Justice Rehnquist, is when the public sees a donor

GENERAL NIXON:

15

QUESTION:

The perception would not change.

General Nixon, the inherent language

16

you just quoted, that's straight out of Buckley v. Valeo.

17

Is there a difference in the proof that Missouri presented

18

and what was before the Court in Buckley?

You are correct, Justice

Is that corrupt?
No, it's not, Your Honor.

There's worse -- that causes

I take it.
GENERAL NIXON:

No.

Mirroring, a politician

12

mirroring his views to the people he represents is not

13

corruption.

14

That's democracy.

QUESTION:

Is it corruption if he uses

15

contributions as a proxy to assist him in making that

16

determination?

17

GENERAL NIXON:

No, it is not.

It is only

18

corruption when he acts contrary to what his other -- his

19

position would otherwise be.

20

The every-day operation of Government in which

21

campaigns run and politics occurs is part of the vibrancy

22

of our democracy, and there's nothing corrupt about that

particular general process.

Now, suppose a labor union tells a candidate,

That's not corruption.

But then let's assume a corporation comes to him and says,

we will give you $10,000 with which you can hire people to

would have done, okay, if you will oppose the minimum

2

We're talking the same activity.

3

Some of it is being given in-kind by the labor union.

4

other is being purchased by the corporation, and you're

5

saying the perception of corruption arises in one case and

6

it does not arise in the other.

7

GENERAL NIXON:

No, Your Honor.

What I'm saying

8

is, in the technical sense of our laws, actions by that

9

labor union might also be illegal if they were a

10

contribution to the candidate in above the amount of

11

$1,000.

QUESTION:

Justice Scalia's asking not about the

cash, that we'll turn out our forces for you and we'll pay

GENERAL NIXON:

The Missouri legislature,

Justice Rehnquist, has not found that that particular

problem warrants the level of control that the handing of

8

money does.

9

that conduct is also of the type that might.

They may, at some future time,

indicate that

Oh, so it's up to them what's an

12

and they can come down on some things because in their

all-powerful discretion they can consider it an appearance

QUESTION:

GENERAL NIXON:

What's at issue here?
Both, but the paramount interest

8

is that of the candidate, and his or her ability to speak.

9

That is the greater speech question.

10

The secondary question of the contributor is

11

more of an associational right, almost speech by proxy.

12

When you give money to a campaign --

13

QUESTION:

Do you think the candidate is

14

asserting a right to require the State to facilitate his

15

fundraising in some way?

16

GENERAL NIXON:

17

QUESTION:

Is that what's being asserted?
I don't understand.

How far does this go?

I mean,

if a

State requires a certain number of signatures to be

gathered on a petition before one can be a candidate,

8

GENERAL NIXON:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

If we look at the impact on the

10

candidate's ability to communicate to the electorate, does

11

the record tell us what the situation was before the

12

statute was passed with respect to what portion of the

13

money they raised was by contributions over $1,000, what

14

portion was raised by contributions under $1,000?

15

GENERAL NIXON:

The record indicates, Justice

Stevens, that a very small percentage of the money, less

17

than 2 percent of all candidates, was raised at levels

18

above $1,000.

19

It also indicates --

QUESTION:

So that would indicate that there's

maybe a 2-percent diminution in the candidate's ability to

speak?

number.

7

GENERAL NIXON:

They may have more, Your Honor,

8

but I would posit that the ability of someone who's in

9

office to sell their vote, that vote is worth a lot more

10

than a challenger, and consequently the level of

11

corruption and potential corruption is dramatic, and

12

consequently, as -- you know, so I think there are a

13

number of factors involved in the practicalities of

politics and running races, and incumbents and

challengers, but the system has been vibrant and alive

QUESTION:

General Nixon, the Buckley case has

What is the standard that you are asking, do you extract

from Buckley that you are asking this Court to apply?

22

would you formulate it?

GENERAL NIXON:

It doesn't say strict.

The formula, the standard of

scrutiny would be a rigorous standard of review, somewhat

less than strict scrutiny.

limit was based on three holdings, each of which remains

as valid today as it was in 1976.

Second, that of all forms of political support,

Looking at all three of those, either separately

15

and together, the Court in Buckley concluded that a $1,000

16

limit imposed only an incidental burden, or an incidental

17

restriction, or an attenuated burden on the three rights

18

taken together, and for that reason, and this responds to

19

Justice Ginsburg's question, the Court applied a less-

than-strict standard of scrutiny that it formally

Yes,

it was, and the Burdick

standard has been -- first of all, it was agreed upon as a

standard I believe by all members of the Court in Burdick,

both the majority and the dissent, and it was also

that I've described fall into a rather unbroken line of

reasoning,

One of the parts of Buckley's

I think, was that you can have campaign limits

Buckley, because alternate channels are available for the

potential contributor.

13

Can the potential contributor, say, join together with

others and buy a newspaper ad saying,

Is that true under Missouri law?

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I support Joe Blow?

It is, indeed,

I think, Mr.

Chief Justice, that it is even more true in Missouri than

17

it is under Federal law, because, for example,

19

to political party committees, that is, political parties

20

can create committees and, unlike the Federal law, which

limits how much one can give to a political party or to a

If you're a one-issue person,

nonspeech element of the large contribution.

First of all,

It's a very difficult

I think it's fair to say that

Second of all, it is true that there may be
other forms of activity that might beholden a candidate to

act in his own self-interest, rather than in the

disinterested conduct of his public functions, but

Congress and legislatures are surely entitled to focus at

least first on the conduct that it concludes forms the

most immediate basis for corruption, or the perception of

corruption, and which -- and I think this goes to some of

in looking

1

at the First amendment interests involved and deeming them

2

not to be substantial, it found with respect to the

3

contributor -- well, first of all, with respect to the

4

candidate, that the candidate's interest was in having

5

sufficient money, or sufficient fuel in order to make his

6

message known, and the qualitative test this Court

7

established, and this goes to the inflation questions that

8

were asked, is whether the contribution restrictions have

a severe impact on political dialogue such that they

prevent candidates and political committees as a class

11

from amassing the resources necessary for political

advocacy.

under the level of scrutiny that was applied in Buckley

was that the contribution limit, and I'm quoting here,

20

focuses precisely and only on the narrow aspect of

political association where the actuality and potentiality

for corruption have been identified, while leaving persons

Missouri's only evidence is the affidavit

With respect to the effect of the Missouri

6

contribution limits on the amount of contributions, the

7

record shows only -- and this is with regard to two

elections that the State of Missouri examined in 1992 --

9

the contribution limit in 1994 would have been $1,000

under Missouri law.

It's been raised to $1,075.

With respect to the two elections, that the

12

State of Missouri examined 1.49 and 2.38 percent of the

contributions made in the 1994 elections would have been

barred by the $1,000 limit.

15

contributions in excess of $1,000 could be any real

QUESTION:

It hardly seems like

if you first accept the

If it is a serious argument here, then the

QUESTION:

But I'm not sure -- and I recognize

2

that you've got that in the record, and I think that's

3

important, but I'm not sure that it really goes to the

4

justification here, because the justification here is, we

5

need a political system in which there is some kind of a

6

basic level of confidence on the part of the people

7

governed in the integrity of the system.

8

9

And political scientists may be reasonably
sure -- I -- they're not unanimous,

I understand, but some

10

of them may be reasonably sure that the money does not buy

11

what most people think it buys, but I don't think there

12

has been a refutation that most people do think that it

13

buys something that shouldn't be bought, and as long as

14

that is the case, the argument against the appearance of

corruption is in part an argument against the cynicism

16

that that induces, and I would suppose that was still a

17

sound argument and a sound justification.

18

MR. LA PIERRE:

Well, it would be difficult to

19

argue, Mr. Justice Souter, that Government should never

care about an appearance of corruption, but the Eighth

Circuit tried to address that problem by insisting that

we need an unusual empirical, or a heavily empirical

2

justification for something which seems so intuitively

plausible?

4

MR. LA PIERRE:

The short answer is that we

5

don't need any heavily empirical justification, and that's

6

certainly not what the Eighth Circuit required.

7

It's important to remember that this case was

8

decided on cross-motion for summary judgment, and Missouri

9

had as its evidence only the affidavit of Senator Goode.

10

Senator Goode's affidavit was not sufficient to raise any

11

question of material fact with respect to the question

12

whether campaign contributions in Missouri cause any real

13

harm.

14

QUESTION:

May I interrupt you?

If Missouri had

brought in 10 supposedly representative citizens who all

Ordinarily we don't try issues of

MR. LA PIERRE:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe

you're correct, but the issue here is whether Missouri has

8

MR. LA PIERRE:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
There was some anecdotal

10

evidence in Buckley, but the Court stressed that inherent

11

in large contributions is this perception, and so what

12

puzzles me is why, if Congress could act on that

13

assumption, that inherent assumption, why the Eighth

14

Circuit could then say to the Missouri legislature, but

15

you must show us, even though Congress was not required to

16

do that, unless the Eighth Circuit is rejecting Buckley to

17

that extent.

18

MR. LA PIERRE:

I believe the Eighth Circuit

19

correctly recognized that in Buckley Congress had some

20

evidence of real corruption, and when there's evidence of

21

real corruption, one can say that a reasonable inference

of an appearance of corruption arises.

MR. LA PIERRE:

I don't mean to quibble, and

7

that's certainly one possible reading of Buckley, that an

8

amorphous general concept of some appearance of corruption

was sufficient to justify campaign contribution limits,

Well --

QUESTION:

Sorry.

5

QUESTION:

-- but it was a serious point.

6

Why is it that we can depart from the

7

conclusions that the Congress reached in Buckley, is that

8

big contributions have lead to real instances of

9

corruption, and therefore we're going to stop it?

10

wouldn't the same thing happen today in Missouri?

2

We're

talking --

MR. LA PIERRE:

11

Justice Kennedy,

Why

I believe it

12

would be a mistake to view Buckley as a grandfather

13

governor of all $1,000 campaign contributions, regardless

14

of when, why, or how they were adopted.
If there were problems in 1974, and there was

15
16

evidence of actual corruption back in 1974 that warranted

17

limits on campaign contributions, that does not mean that

18

the same conditions necessarily prevailed in Missouri in

19

1994 when the Missouri legislature acted.
All we're looking for is that the Missouri

20
21

legislature have some evidence of some real problem before

22

they impose limits on significant First Amendment

23

interests.

24

talking about corruption and appearance of corruption, and

1

I'm not sure those are the -- actually the words that

2

capture what may be at issue in a case like this.
It seems to me that a large contributor buys

3
4

access to an official when he makes a contribution.

5

assumes that the legislator, if elected, will be able to

6

see him more readily than if he had not made a

7

contribution, so he can present to the legislator the

8

reasons why he thinks something he -- is in the public

9

interest or in the interests of his company, or something

10
11

He

like that.
Would it be reasonable for the people of

12

Missouri to think everyone should have the same right of

13

access to legislators after elected, and that if you allow

14

people to contribute $25,000 or so, they will have a

15

special access that the ordinary citizen would not have.

16

That's not exactly corruption, but it's an appearance of

17

unequal treatment that borders on an appearance of

18

corruption.

19

Would that be relevant in the analysis?

MR. LA PIERRE:

Allowing access or granting

20

access to those who give a lot as opposed to those who

21

give little or nothing would be entirely inappropriate,

22

and there is, of course, no evidence on this record that

anything like that occurs.

MR. LA PIERRE:

Once again, there may be a more

benign explanation.

3

that a healthy business climate was good for everybody in

the State, that wide expression of views was something

5

that those with more wherewithal than others should

6

promote, and while one might take a jaded view of

7

contributions to opposing candidates, it's at least

8

possible to take a more kind view of such contributions.

9

QUESTION:

A contributor might take the view

Well, could, say, the Missouri

10

legislature, really wanting to clamp down on this access,

11

say that no legislature should see any person for more

12

than 15 minutes?

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. LA PIERRE:

That would seem to disrupt in

15

very, very significant ways the legislator's

16

responsibility to meet with constituents, learn their

17

views, and make informed judgments.

18

QUESTION:

I suppose the most likely scenario

19

for significant contribution would be the notion that I

will give this money, and expect in return that if and

offer money in the future, but another explanation is

simply that the contributor and the politician, or the

that the sources proved to be reliable in the past.

It might be simply because the

We want to equalize the opportunity, though we will never

QUESTION:

Or whatever the name was I made up.

2

MR. LA PIERRE:

The interest that you've

point in Buckley, that Government should not limit the

voice of some in order to ensure that the voices of others

are amplified.

7

That's not a basis --

QUESTION:

But don't we do that every day of the

8

week?

I thought there were time limits in the House of

Representatives so that a person -- or in the Senate -- I

10

don't know about the Senate, but I mean,

I thought that

11

people were limited every day of the week.

12

for more than an hour, and the reason we're only allowing

13

you to talk for an hour is so that others can talk, too.

14

What do you mean, you never can limit the voice of some so

that others can't speak?

MR. LA PIERRE:

Then we could try trusting the

2

American public, which has shown a lot of good judgment in

3

the past and seems ready to recognize when politicians

4

take too much money from particular sources, and to hold

5

that against the politicians who make those decisions.

6

QUESTION:

Maybe a better analogy where

7

everybody has equal time to speak would be not limiting

8

their time, but perhaps stuffing a sock in the mouth of

9

the more eloquent speakers so that they will all speak

10
11
12

13

with exactly the same effect.
MR. LA PIERRE:

That analogy would be similar to

limiting how many candidate contributions -QUESTION:

It sounds as though you think the

14

most important First Amendment interest in this case is

15

not the interest of the candidate in amassing money, but

16

the interest of Ebenezer Scrooge in getting his message

17

across, and that was downplayed very severely in Buckley,

18

because he can get his message across with a symbolic

19

contribution of $10, and he can say anything he wants to

on his own with his million and a half that he wants to

give to the candidate to let the candidate decide what to

do with it.

to be able to garner the funds to allow him or her to

express political views, and whatever was said in Buckley

about the effect of contribution limits, that was said in

the context of what was essentially a challenge to the

statute on its face.

7

The most important point is for the candidate

In this case, we can see the actual application

8

of the Missouri statute to a particular contributor and to

9

a particular candidate, and the record shows that the

10

particular contributor would have given more, the

11

candidate would have accepted that contribution, and with

12

that contribution would have been able to make a greater

13

expression of his political views.

14

QUESTION:

And is it not somewhat worrisome that

15

for a full year after the announcement of the candidate,

16

this candidate relied exclusively on that one PAC, and

17

when he was subjected to the Missouri law, did appeal more

18

generally to the electorate, and the idea of having one

19

supporter alone, and then appealing to a broader segment

20

of the population, as he eventually did,

21

something disconcerting to say that I can rely on one

large funder and forget the rest of the public?

reasonably be questioned, and that's the important point

2

about the Eighth Circuit's judgment.

3

It looked for objectively reasonable evidence of

4

some harm, and it held Missouri to the standard of having

5

some objectively reasonable evidence before it could

6

impose limits on important First Amendment interests.

7

QUESTION:

But you would say on that reasoning

8

that the Federal judges, the ban on federal judges'

9

honorariums would not be reasonably justified without

10
11

actual evidence of corruption by a judge.
In other words, I take it, on your view, that

12

the reasonable appearance statute would require something

13

more than appearance in order to require just

14

disqualification, is that right?

MR. LA PIERRE:

Actual evidence of wrongdoing is

the best evidence of an appearance of a problem.
QUESTION:

Is it necessary evidence in the cases

of the judges' honoraria?
MR. LA PIERRE:

I believe it would be necessary,

20

because otherwise one could lose the services of a judge,

21

or, in the context of our case, individuals could lose

22

their right to both make contributions to advance their

23

political views, and to receive contributions to advance

24

their political views, on the basis of what might be no

25

more than mistaken perceptions.

QUESTION:

Well, can't Congress, or

the number of -- the amount of honoraria that Federal

judges can take, and it couldn't -- it certainly couldn't

dealing with holders of public office.
MR. LA PIERRE:

3

That's correct, the standard of

scrutiny under the First Amendment is lower with respect

5

to restrictions on public employees than it would be with

6

respect to candidates and contributors.

7

QUESTION:

If we were to conclude that one of

8

the collateral consequences of Buckley was that the system

9

has become obsessed with raising money, that what was once

10

a minor function of a Congressman or a Senator has now

11

become his major activity, does that bear on our analysis?
MR. LA PIERRE:

12

No.

It seems inappropriate for

Government to make a decision how much money is the right

14

amount of money, or what type of approach to campaign

MR. LA PIERRE:

The assumption in our

constitutional system is that limits on political speech

are not the norm, and if it's a choice between striking

expenditure limits or striking contribution limits, one

should strike both.

just one question.

the potential of corrupting the political process, an

argument that you've made for limiting the contributions.

14

GENERAL NIXON:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
