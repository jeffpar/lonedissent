ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER J. ROCKLER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. ROCKLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves a claim for overpayment of

12

income tax for the calendar year 1988.

13

question of the overpayment.

14

acknowledged.

15

There is no

It occurred and is

The taxpayer's claim was filed June 1, 1993 on

16

Mr. Baral's income tax return which was filed late.

17

Nevertheless, there is no dispute that the claim of

18

overpayment was timely for code section 6511(a) purposes.

19

The question of a limitations bar to recovery

20

arises under code section 6511(b), which provides that

21

only payment of tax sought to be refunded, made within 3

22

years before the claim, may be recovered.

23

plus any extension of time granted to file a return.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. ROCKLER:

It's 3 years

4 months here?
4 months in this case, yes.

If the starting date for limitations -- if the

1
2

starting date for limitations is April 15, 1989, the

3

payments could not be recovered.

4

June 1, 1993.

The starting date is

The statute of limitations does not apply.

The limitations period under section 6511(b)

5
6

starts running from the date of payment of the income tax,

7

not from the date that income tax liability arose or

8

accrued.

9

In the Government's view and that of the court

10

of appeals below, the payment of income tax was made April

11

15, 1989, the income tax return due date, although on that

12

date, the amount of income tax liability had not been

13

determined and was not known by anyone.

14

The Government and the court below assert that

15

section 6513(b) -- (b)(1) and (2)

-- makes the return due

16

date the starting date for limitations, quote, as a matter

17

of law.

18

of the return was the date of payment of the income tax.

In other words, they assert that deemed due date

19

In our view this is a misreading of the statute.

20

The statute provides that the -- the deemed date, the date

21

of the return being due, is the date to which withholding

22

taxes and estimated taxes are brought forward instead of

23

their actual payment dates which occurred during the

24

calendar year.

QUESTION:

But the statute reads as though

9

MR. ROCKLER:

It's at the end of both briefs.

10

In our principal brief, it's at page A-12, appendix page

11

That says, any amount paid as estimated income

tax for any taxable year -- I repeat estimated income tax

14

-- shall be deemed to have been paid on the last day

Now, the court in considering this, at least

Rosenman case, which has been featured heavily in the

briefs here.

May -- may I interrupt you, Mr.

5

Rockier, for just a second?

6

to draw a distinction?

deeming a date for the payment of the estimated tax other

than to establish the date of payment of the tax itself?

9

MR. ROCKLER:

Why would the Congress want

What is the significance of

No, no.

There -- if I may say so,

10

Justice Stevens, the statute which originally brought this

11

into the code, the 1943 tax act, made the point that the

12

deemed date was the deemed date, but not earlier than the

13

deemed date.

14

got dropped in the '54 code.

In other words, that phrase appeared.

It

15

But the significance I think is that you have

16

cases not unusual at all, where taxpayers file a return

17

early between December 31 and the due date of the return,

18

and the -- that -- that filing of a return and bringing

19

across the credits for withholding and estimated taxes

20

against the income tax would start the statute of

21

limitations running before the return date.

22

start interest running before the return date.

23

It also would

And I think the real function was to limit the

24

application of the statute to not earlier than a return

filed on the due date -6

So, at

10

law, at least the caption, prepaid income tax, and the

MR. ROCKLER:

12

As to the caption, first, I think

13

that is a -- a secondary or tertiary form of reading the

14

-- the statute.

15

are of more consequence.

I think the words of the statute itself

But the word prepaid income tax can also be

16
17

viewed as a synonym for advanced payment of income tax, in

18

other words, can refer to a credit situation.

QUESTION:

2

If you were going to rely on it, I

would have thought it would be a good idea to reproduce

it.

7

MR. ROCKLER:

I regret, Your Honor -- Mr. Chief

Justice, that I don't think it is in the briefs.
But that has two subsections, one of which deals

8

with late return filing.

It says, interest shall not be

9

paid until the return is filed.

Then it has another

10

subsection entitled advanced payments, withholding taxes,

11

and estimated taxes, and that, in effect, deals with early

12

payments and says interest won't be paid until the due

13

date at the earliest.

14

pretty much in the '43 act.

15

In effect, it repeats what was said

Now, one reason why we've referred to the '43

16

act is the Government has cited that act, I think without

17

any great effect, as controlling with respect to the

18

purpose for which this was adopted.

19

Incidentally, I may say, in response to Justice

20

Ginsburg's comments, that the Habig case, which we have

21

cited in the brief -- that's 390 U.S. at page 225 -- deals

22

with section 6513(a).

here are 6513(b).

1

clear that that is designed for the purposes which I

2

ascribed to 6513(b), namely not to start the statute

3

before the return due date, not to start interest payments

4

before the due date.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Rockier, the Habig case was

6

about, was -- was it not, filing a false tax return?

7

it seems to be quite far afield from this case.

8

MR. ROCKLER:

9

directly on point for this case.

So,

Oh, it is not -- it is not
We -- we cited that case

10

primarily for the point that impossibility may override

11

the application of the statute.

12

criminal case and a statute of limitations of 6 years.

13

And the question was, did the statute start on the return

14

due date or the actual filing of the return?

15

Court held it had to be the actual filing because the

16

offense was to be found in the return filed.

17

you have a statute of limitations running before the

18

offense occurred?

19

In that case, there was a

And the

How could

Similarly, in our situation, our position

20

basically is, how can you have the payment of a tax when

21

nobody knows what it is?

22

that long ago this Court held that to be the governing

23

principle here.

24

the Rosenman case is very central to your consideration, I

25

think, of this situation.

And I might remind the Court

That's -- that's the Rosenman case, and

The Rosenman case was very close to this case in

1

2

many respects.

There the taxpayer, a month or so before

3

he filed a return, sent in a letter saying that he was

4

paying an estimated tax, which is involved here as well,

5

for the purpose of avoiding penalties and interest.

6

the Court said at the time he remitted the estimate of

7

estate tax there, he couldn't be paying the estate tax

8

because nobody knew what the estate tax was at that time.
QUESTION:

9

And

But -- but Rosenman too, Mr. Rockier,

10

involved a rather express agreement by the Government, did

11

it not, to kind of hold this in escrow?

12

MR. ROCKLER:

13

QUESTION:

14

No.

Certainly the Court said that in its

opinion.

15

MR. ROCKLER:

No, I don't think the Court said

16

it was an express agreement.

17

operating agreement whereby the taxpayer paid in an

18

estimate and the Government put it in the suspense

19

account.

20

They said this was an

And we have exactly the same situation.

I refer

21

the Court to the record in this case.

There is a

22

certificate of assessments which shows that until such

23

time as the return was filed and assessment was made, the

24

withholding taxes and the estimated taxes were -- were

25

held in a suspense account as credits.

As a matter of

Now, the Government has carefully avoided any
discussion of the two governing regulations in this case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Rockier, before you -- before you

get off Rosenman, there was -- there was another feature

10

in that case which -- which no longer exists and is -- is

11

not a factor in the present case, and that is the

It was asserting that for purposes of -- of

18

the statute of limitation, the date on which it should

19

have been filed was determinative, but that for purposes

20

of whether interest runs, the date of actual filing was

21

determinative so that you would not get any interest on

22

the prepayment until the return was actually filed.

23

Now, that feature of the law has since been

24

changed by -- by statutory amendment so that you will get

25

interest from the date that the -- at least from the

MR. ROCKLER:

That's 6611.

That just isn't so.

QUESTION:

Well, that's to encourage you to file

MR. ROCKLER:

Yes.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Rockier, I'm concerned that the

2

argument that you -- you are making would be detrimental

3

to many taxpayers, and let me give you this example.

4

Suppose -- let's take the year 1988.

$100,000

in both estimated taxes and withholding were paid in, and

6

then a return is filed in the year 1993, as here.

had never paid the tax.
MR. ROCKLER:

11

No.

I think in that case, on the

12

hypothetical you gave, if -- if there were accumulated

13

withholding and estimated taxes, as in our case, there

14

would not be any interest with respect to those amounts

15

that accumulated as a suspense credit item.

no payment whatever --

If there were no payment whatever

Well, you say it's payment for some

purposes and not others?
MR. ROCKLER:

22

No, no.

It's not payment.

It's a

23

credit.

The -- the payment in the nature of a deposit,

24

which is what Rosenman described the remittance as, does

25

serve to mitigate against an interest charge against the

confidently, but what statutory provision is it that says

Which you don't cite in your brief.

MR. ROCKLER:

1

Well, so we have a new section and we

2

have also the point Justice Scalia made.

And I wondered

3

as well in Rosenman, although Frankfurter did use the word

4

estimated taxes, I don't know that the payor thought of it

5

that way because the payor said this payment is made under

6

protest and duress, just to avoid penalties and interest,

7

since it is contended by the executors that not all of

8

this sum is legally or lawfully due.

And so, one might

say given that they didn't think they owed it, it wasn't

MR. ROCKLER:

12

But here it is an effort

13

is that the transmittal letter of the taxpayer, according

14

to the Court, said it was an estimate on Federal estate

The Court I think is referring to the transmittal

QUESTION:

But -- but as Justice Breyer's

1

questions suggest, we're living in a post-Rosenman world,

20

and after Rosenman, the Government made express provision

21

in its revenue procedures so that if you paid a remittance

22

as a deposit, you had to expressly say it was a deposit.

23

So, even if Rosenberg were wholly in your favor, it seems

24

to me to have been altered by the revenue rulings after

that this is a deposit.
MR. ROCKLER:

2

And that wasn't done here.
Justice Kennedy, if I may say so,

3

both withholding taxes and an estimate do nothing but give

4

rise to credits, and there are regulations in effect which

say these credits are to be applied -- future tense --

when the return is filed, and they are set up against the

income tax then known to be due.
QUESTION:

says so?

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. JONES:

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
There really is a simple, straightforward,

8

textual answer to the question presented in this case, and
10

it only takes me about a minute to describe it.
Section 6511 of the code limits the amount of

11

12

any refund to the amount of taxes paid during the 3 years

13

prior to the filing of the refund claim.

14

this case is simply when are remittances of estimated

15

withholding taxes to be regarded as paid for the specific

16

purpose of the refund limitations in section 6511, and the

17

introductory clause of section 6513(b) expressly and

18

concisely answers that question, for it says that

1

remittances of estimated tax and withholding taxes shall,

20

21

paid on the date the return is due.
The history of this provision makes perfectly

cites in the regulations are simply provisions that direct

It's not a

And -- and I should emphasize that -- maybe out

8

of context, but the reason why we accept deposits is not

9

discussed in any of these cases and it's kind of obscure.

10

The only reason why a taxpayer would ever want to make a

before the case arose, the Service had long taken the

2

position that a remittance of tax from a taxpayer who in

fact owed no liability would not be treated as a payment

of tax but would be held in a suspense account on which no

interest would accrue.
The reason the Service had done this back in the

the Rosenman case, under that new statute the payment

6

the United States made in the Rosenman case was that the

9

resolved an uncertainty that had existed in the past about

whether those kinds of payments would be held as suspense

that.

In the Rosenman case, the Court said it will not do

14

to treat these funds as a payment or not as a payment

depending on whether the Government wins or loses.

because the Government treated -- at the time of the

There is a -- a broad point that I want to

mention, and that is if petitioner's argument were

9

accepted, it would seriously disadvantage the vast

10

majority of taxpayers who pay timely, who file timely

returns, and who file timely claims for refund.

12

is because on petitioner's theory, payments of estimated

taxes, of withholding, payments made with -- with the

would simply be a deposit and would not be a payment on
