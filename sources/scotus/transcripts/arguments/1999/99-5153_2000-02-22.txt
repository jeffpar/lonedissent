ORAL ARGUMENT OF RITA LA LUMIA

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MS. LA LUMIA:

It's pronounced La Lumia.

QUESTION:

MS. LA LUMIA:

12

Mr. Chief Justice --

QUESTION:

(Laughter.)

15

MS. LA LUMIA:

16

La Lumia.

I stand corrected.

Thank you.

It's like Scalia.

Right?

Something like that.

Lumia.

Something

like that.

17

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

18

The issue presented in this case is whether

19

reimposition of supervised release under the provisions of

20

subsection (h) of the supervised release statute violates

21

the Ex Post Facto Clause in this case.

22

The Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits any law that

23

is applied retrospectively and, in application,

24

disadvantages an individual by imposing a sentence that is

25

greater or harsher than that which would have applied at

1

the time that the offense was committed.
The respondent in this case has effectively-

2

3

conceded that the application of the provisions of

4

subsection (h) in this case and reimposition of supervised

5

release is retrospective in this case.

6

question remains then whether respondent was disadvantaged

7

by application of those provisions and reimposition of

8

supervised release.

9

QUESTION:

10

However, the

What -- what do you mean or what do

you think respondent --by the term retrospective?
MS. LA LUMIA:

11

Retrospective means an

12

application of a statute that is applied after commission

13

of the offense, the initial offense.

14

-- the operative date is the date of Mr. Johnson's

15

offense.

16

that would be the operative date because supervised

17

release is a punishment that springs forth from that

18

offense.

And in this case the

His credit card crime was committed in 1993 and

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. LA LUMIA:

21

QUESTION:

From that offense.
Yes.

Now, the First Circuit, in an opinion

22

by Judge Selya I believe, thought that the original

23

statute, 3583(e) unmodified permitted the same thing.

24

Isn't that right?

25

That was the First Circuit position.

MS. LA LUMIA:

That's correct.

That is the --

QUESTION:

So, if that were the case, it

wouldn't matter that 3583(h) was enacted I suppose.

That's -- that's exactly right,

Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

So, if we were to adopt the First

Circuit view, end of case.
MS. LA LUMIA:

That's correct.

That's correct.

There would be no need, as you say, for Congress to have
enacted subsection (h).
QUESTION:

Well, except there was a split of

authority and I suppose they wanted to deal with that.

13

MS. LA LUMIA:

14

QUESTION:

15

MS. LA LUMIA:

That's right.

And --

Because we hadn't.
I think that there was an

16

invitation for this Court to deal with it because there

17

was a circuit split.

18

circuits that addressed the issue to which you are

19

referring have determined that subsection (e)(3), the

20

earlier version, that was in effect at the time of Mr.

21

Johnson's offense --

other.

correct, that is the end of this case.

on why O'Neil was incorrect because at least I found it a

5

fairly persuasive analysis.

6

And O'Neil, as you conceded -- if O'Neil was

MS. LA LUMIA:

So, please focus

The decision in O'Neil is

7

incorrect, and the rationale of several courts who have

8

addressed this issue is more persuasive.

9

The -- the initial approach in determining

10

whether subsection (e)(3) offered the authority for

11

imposition --or reimposition of supervised release begins

12

with the statute itself.

13

subsection (e)(3), it's very, very clear on its face.

14

permits a court, upon the correct findings -- in other

15

words, a violation of supervised release -- to revoke an

16

individual's supervised release and to -- to require that

17

the person serve in prison all or part of the term of

18

supervised release.

19

QUESTION:

If one looks at the text of

But they used the -- the term revoke

20

in (3) but terminate in (1).

21

position would be stronger if they had used the word

22

terminate in (3) as well.

difference that could be drawn from -- from the use of

supervised release is terminated if, after a period of 1

year, the court determines that the conduct of the person

of supervised release.

A person is terminated -- a person's term of

In other words, it's much like an honorable

Terminate has some sort of benevolent

connotation and revoke doesn't?
MS. LA LUMIA:

12

Well, in this situation it -- it

13

does.

Under subsection (1), the terminate does, indeed,

14

refer to a favorable resolution of the supervised release

15

term.

16

However, under subsection (e)(3) where the --

17

where Congress has used the word revoke, it demonstrates

18

an unfavorable conclusion of the term of supervised

19

release.

subsection (e)(3) refers to revocation upon a violation of

It isn't just terminated.

MS. LA LUMIA:

It's

That's exactly right, Justice

I thought that under Selya's reading of

Divide it.

MS. LA LUMIA:

10

Well, and in fact, Congress has

11

made that authority available by enactment of subsection

(h) .

QUESTION:

I know that.

But, I mean, why

14

wouldn't they have wanted it, as frankly I always they

thought they did, from day one since there is no other

he's -- if it's 5 years that you sentenced him to

thought -- but I might be wrong -- you're back at square

So, then why isn't

The starting point would be a

And revoke, under the plain

But how can you maintain that when

13

(h), which does take the position you would say

14

prospectively only -- that section also uses the term

15

revoked, and then spells out that you revoke it, you go

16

back to square one, and you can make the division, but not

17

quite as you conceded before because (e)(3) says even if

Under our reading of subsection

Well, I think --

Yes, but the word revoked -- you

can't put much weight on it when it's retained in the

offense was committed,

QUESTION:

(h) wasn't there.
That's correct.

So, I think we have to -- I -- I

suppose we have to look at the statute as if (h) were not

there, other than the Congress gives a reading which we

may give some -- some weight to because it seems to

interpret the statute in a particular way.

MS. LA LUMIA:

I agree.

I don't -- I

I think that

enactment of subsection (h), specifically limits --

use it.

18

MS. LA LUMIA:

I should have said

I agree with you, and under

19

subsection (e)(3) where the Congress has provided the

20

authority to revoke a term of supervised release, if one

21

looks at a common, plain dictionary definition of the word

22

revoked, it clearly contemplates a recision, an end, a

23

conclusion, that type of thing, a termination of a

24

probation or -- or in this case, a supervised release

25

order because of a rule violation.

QUESTION:

It doesn't have to.

2

QUESTION:

Ms. La Lumia, is -- is Judge Selya's

3

position, the Government's position here, that the only

4

supervised release that can be imposed after the

5

revocation is whatever had not yet been served?

6

let's assume he had been given 5 years of supervised

7

release.

8

is -- is it -- is it Selya's position and the Government's

9

position that the court can impose an additional 5 years

10

I mean,

He -- he violates the terms after 2 years, and

of supervised release afterwards or only 3 years?
MS. LA LUMIA:

11

I believe it's the Government's

12

position that they may impose 5 years of supervised

13

release.

14

QUESTION:

The full 5 years.

So, really what

15

you need to get to Selya's very intelligent position, as

16

Judge Breyer sees it, makes more sense.

17

But to get there, what you need is some authorization to

18

impose a term of supervised release at this stage, and the

19

only -- the only authorization for imposing supervised

20

release is 3583 (a) , which says the court in imposing a

21

sentence to a term of imprisonment for a felony or

22

misdemeanor may include as part of the sentence.

23

It probably does.

At the original sentencing, you have authority

24

to impose 5 years.

25

authority to impose 5 years under (e)(3).

you have authority to use the leftover -- the leftover 3

In this -- in this particular

case, the extent of the supervised release order at

It's just another word for parole.

Yes.

That's relevant for this case in the

I'm not certain that that's the right way

MR. WOLFSON:

I -- I think that some courts have

I think it would

of course, the judge was proceeding under (h).

But I think Justice Breyer's example

was no violation.

They just changed their mind and wanted

MR. WOLFSON:

Right.

QUESTION:

But the reason you say that is that

7

it -- I take it, that it would make no sense or it

8

wouldn't make much sense to say that upon revocation the

9

sentence may be to all or even a portion of the original

10

period of supervised release, unless Congress had meant

11

that if the court sentences only to a portion, there would

12

be at least the balance of supervised release to be served

3

as supervised release because that only -- that's the only

4

reading that would be consistent with the theory of what

5

supervised release is there for.

6

MR. WOLFSON:

I think that's basically right.

7

That is, when one does interpret this statute, one has to

8

bear in mind what the policies of supervised release are.

9

And it does raise, I think as -- as the First Circuit and

20

the Eighth Circuit and one of the Eleventh Circuit

MR. WOLFSON:

I'm not sure I agree with that,

Justice Scalia.

First of all, I think if -- if Congress

20

had wanted that approach, one would have expected it to

say something like the district judge must revoke his

MR. WOLFSON:

Yes.

Well, what it -- what it points

3

out, though, I think is that if the district court saw

4

that only a short amount of time in prison was necessary

5

and it gave that to the discretion of the district court

6

-- if only a short amount of time in prison was necessary

7

to sort of get the offender back on the right path, and

then after the offender was on the right path, you know,

it was time to start the supervised release experiment

again, I think that -- that -- that's what Congress

11

intended for -- for district courts to have the

flexibility to do.

13

QUESTION:

The reason -- the reason you say it

14

would be illogical to deny that, I take it, is that

supervised release is supposed to increase the odds of the

looked to when it -- when it was thinking about what did

In the special parole statute, the

Now, there is a -- there is a conflict as to

whether it could impose special parole again, but there's

11

no disagreement among the courts that it could impose at

his special parole the first time.

14

this is the experience that Congress has looked to.

And so, this is --

Similarly, under the old probation statute, the

QUESTION:

-- who committed their offenses after

(h) was enacted?
MR. WOLFSON:

Well, our position in this case is

that it was -- it was acceptable to apply (h) because it

QUESTION:

No, but (h) is part of a statutory

amendment that made (e)(3) more severe because (e)(3)

under the new amendment imposes -- authorizes a longer

11

period of imprisonment than (e)(3) under the old statute.

12

MR. WOLFSON:

QUESTION:

15

Right.

Well, it depends --

So, that statute as a whole could, in

some cases, be more severe.
MR. WOLFSON:

It depends on one looks at the

16

amendment that was made to (e)(3) because, after all, what

17

is true is that even before (e)(3) was amended, under the

18

old -- under the old (e)(3), of course, that the limit --

19

there was a limit of the term that was actually imposed.

20

But it -- one has to remember it is also true that under

21

(e)(2), the judge could have extended the term to the

22

statutory maximum, and then it could -- and then it could

23

have been revoked and the entire term -- entire term --

in deciding whether that -- whether (h) is more onerous.

And when the Court looks to what the prior law was, we've

relied basically on (e) as it was at the time.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Wolfson, as I read your brief,

19

you were relying specifically on (e)(3) and the reading of

20

that, as Judge Selya did, and you were not infusing this

21

section (e)(2) that was first introduced into this

22

colloquy by Justice Breyer.

one has to look at sort of the -- the menu of options that

have to concede, would you not, that there is some

9

ambiguity, otherwise how could you account for this

10
11

circuit split that is lopsided the other way?
MR. WOLFSON:

Well, certainly courts have looked

12

at this different ways, but the -- this Court has said

13

many times that the mere fact that several lower courts

14

have disagreed about the meaning of a criminal statute

15

doesn't necessarily bring to bear the rule of lenity.

16

I think that the First Circuit's opinion in the O'Neil

17

case presents a rather persuasive explanation of it.

18

And

I think the problem with -- one of the problems

19

with the other courts is that they -- the other courts'

20

constructions of (e) is that they didn't sort of -- they

21

didn't consider what were the policy objectives behind

22

supervised release, and they also didn't place it in the

context of special parole and parole and probation as the

First Circuit did very persuasively.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RITA LA LUMIA

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. LA LUMIA:

9

Thank you.

I want to address a couple points.

10

The first

11

one is the point of policy that the Government makes.

12

must keep in mind that the policy of -- of the imposition

13

of supervised release at initial sentencing may differ

14

from reimposition of supervised release upon revocation,

15

and given that it's more of a punishment for a person's

16

willful failure to abide by the Court's imposed

17

conditions, the petitioner's reading of subsection (e)(3)

18

would make more sense, to allow the court to impose

19

reimprisonment upon revocation.
And, in fact, reimprisonment is what triggers a

20
21

reimposition of supervised release.

22

(h)

23

One

Under subsection

-QUESTION:

But under (e)(3), it's clear the

24

court could, if it wanted to, impose additional

25

imprisonment, isn't it?

I mean, that isn't what the

ambiguity is about.
MS. LA LUMIA:

2

3

Under subsection (e)(3), the

court could, indeed, impose reimprisonment, and there -QUESTION:

4

The question is whether it can impose

5

another term of supervised release or more supervised

6

release.
MS. LA LUMIA:

7

That's correct.

That's correct,

8

at which -- and that -- that is our -- the petitioner's

9

position in this case.

10

There is no authority to reimpose

any term of supervised release.
QUESTION:

11

So, a judge is faced with the

12

alternative, either you send the guy to prison or he goes

13

free.

14

MS. LA LUMIA:

You send him to prison for up to

15

2 years, the statutory limitation under the supervised

16

release statute -- any period in between.

17

can consider factors that would be -- that would make a

18

longer or shorter term of imprisonment appropriate.

20
21

QUESTION:

And the court

How about the benefit of supervised

release in enabling someone to reintegrate into society?
MS. LA LUMIA:

Well, if one considers the

22

benefits weighed against the disadvantages, I think that

23

supervised release is clearly more disadvantageous because

24

it -- it imposes a restraint on liberty.

The proper

I don't why that's the proper

MS. LA LUMIA:

Well,

that's correct.
