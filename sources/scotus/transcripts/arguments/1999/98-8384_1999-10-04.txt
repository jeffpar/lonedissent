ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. GIBBONS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GIBBONS:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I represent the petitioner, Terry Williams, who

12

appeals from a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the

13

Fourth Circuit reversing a United States court district

14

judgment which granted Williams a new sentencing hearing

15

because of ineffective assistance of counsel during the

16

sentencing phase of his trial.

17

The petition presents two issues, the first, was

18

Williams prejudiced as that term is defined in Strickland

1

v. Washington, by the undisputed failure of his counsel to

20

investigate and present available and compelling

21

mitigation evidence?

22

The second is, if Williams was prejudiced by

23

that failure, must an Article III court, including this

24

Court, nevertheless deny habeas corpus relief because

25

section 2254(d)(1) of title 28 compels it to defer to an

erroneous legal decision of the Virginia supreme court on
the Strickland v. Washington issue?
Williams' position on the first issue is that
the experienced State trial judge and the experience
district court judge correctly applied the Strickland
prejudice standard to the undisputed facts respecting
counsel's deficient performance.
QUESTION:

Well, what about the seven

experienced judges of the supreme court of Virginia?
MR. GIBBONS:

The seven experienced judges of

the supreme court of Virginia committed legal error.

The

two trial judges got it right.
With respect to the second issue, Williams'
position is that section 2254(d)(1), properly interpreted,
does not require the entry of a judgment by an Article III
court inconsistent with the constitutional law pronounced
by this Court simply because a State court entered such a
judgment.

The language of section 2254(d)(1) did not,

indeed could not constitutionally require this Court to
enter a judgment inconsistent with its own view of
constitutional law.
Now, if I may, Mr. -QUESTION:

Well,

(d)(1) says, resulted in a

decision that was contrary to or involved an unreasonable
application of clearly established Federal law as

determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.
Would it be fair to say that if the Fourth Circuit in this
case made a reasonable application, say of our decision in
Strickland v. Washington, then the -- your client would
not prevail?
MR. GIBBONS:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

A

reasonable application that is nevertheless an incorrect
application of the law should be reversed.
QUESTION:

But how --

MR. GIBBONS:
QUESTION:

That's what courts do.

But the statute says, it has to have

involved an unreasonable application.

By definition a

reasonable -MR. GIBBONS:

Well, if unreasonable application

means erroneous application in the view of five members of
this Court, then the decision should not stand as a bar to
habeas corpus relief.
QUESTION:

Well then, you say in effect that

(d)(1) really did nothing.
MR. GIBBONS:

(d)(1) in effect codified the

Teague standards.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gibbons, do you argue that in

reading Strickland as modified generally by Lockhart that
a legal error was made?
MR. GIBBONS:

Yes, I do.

QUESTION:

Does that, then -- let's assume that

I agree with you there, assume for the sake of argument.
In your judgment, does that legal error itself entitle you
to a reversal on the ground that the decision was contrary
to the law as established by this Court, without going any
further?
MR. GIBBONS:

Yes, Justice Souter.

It -- the

contrary-to language in 2254(d)(1) seems to me refers to
the selection of the wrong legal standard, and as I read
the cases that have been decided in the courts of appeals,
they all agree that when the State court chooses the wrong
legal standard, there's plenary review.
QUESTION:

Now, suppose it chooses the right

legal standard, but it misapplies it.

Does the contrary-

to clause become inapplicable, and you're then in the next
clause?
MR. GIBBONS:

Well, Justice Kennedy, I read the

clause as one whole clause dealing with legal error.
Factual errors are dealt with in the next provision, in
2254(d)(2), so what the court is -- what the Congress is
saying in (d)(1) is contrary to or an unreasonable
application, in other words, wrong within the ordinary
scope of review rendered to decisions of State courts by
this Court.
QUESTION:

Well, I'm asking you, if the correct

1

legal standard is incorrectly applied, you can say that

2

that is contrary to law.

3

MR. GIBBONS:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

How can you say -- you might say it's

5

contrary to law, but how can you say that it's contrary to

6

clearly established Federal law where you have a -- one

7

Federal case, and your assertion is, you haven't applied

8

it properly to another situation, or you've mixed up

9

Strickland and Lockhart?
I can see how you can say it's contrary to

10
11

Federal law, but I can't see how you can say it's contrary

12

to clearly established Federal law.
MR. GIBBONS:

13

If you read the whole clause,

14

Justice Scalia, it refers to contrary to clearly

15

established law by the Supreme Court of the United States,

16

and - -

17

QUESTION:

Ex ante, or ex post?

I mean, are you

18

saying so long as we say it's wrong later, it's contrary

19

to clearly established law?

20

MR. GIBBONS:

No.

I'm saying that what the

21

statute does is codify the old law rule of Teague, with

22

this qualification, that under Teague you could look to

23

old law established, for example, in the circuit courts,

24

but under this statute Congress has said you can't, but

25

that issue is not presented in this case.

QUESTION:

But you don't have to say clearly

established in order to achieve that.

You could have just

said, a reasonable application of Federal law as
determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, but
Congress is going out of its way to say that it's contrary
to clearly established Federal law.
MR. GIBBONS:

Well, if Congress meant that you

can't decide the case because in the view of, say, one
justice Strickland v. Washington didn't clearly establish
something, that seems to me to put you right within City
of Boerne against -- whatever the name, the case where you
have that RFRA was unconstitutional.

It's a case of

Congress telling this Court how to decide an issue of
constitutional law -QUESTION:

Mr. Gibbons --

MR. GIBBONS:

-- and Congress never intended

that.
QUESTION:

Well --

QUESTION:

Mr. Gibbons, I thought your position

was, and correct me if I'm wrong, that this was a clearly
established violation.

This was contrary.

What the

Virginia supreme court did, what the Fourth Circuit did
was contrary to Strickland, because Strickland never
required this additional test of beyond prejudice, and
both the Virginia supreme court and the Fourth Circuit

departed from it.

This -- in this case, Strickland is a clearly

That should end the inquiry.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. GIBBONS:

So we get no -Now, of course, Virginia suggests

8

that that's not what the supreme court of Virginia did,

9

that it actually applied Strickland.

10

I suggest that if you read the opinion of the

11

Virginia supreme court fairly, that's not what it did.

12

But even if that were the case, even if it were an

13

application of Strickland, choosing the right rule, the

14

question then would be, what is your rule in reviewing

15

that mixed question of fact and law.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Why do you say it's a mixed question

of fact and law?
MR. GIBBONS:

Well,

if I'm right that Virginia

19

simply chose the wrong governing standard, chose the rule

20

against perpetuities instead of Strickland v. Washington,

21

that ends the inquiry.

Strickland, and it seemed to me said the correct rule.

2

Now, your quarrel really is with the way they applied it

to the facts of this case, isn't it?

I don't think you can fairly read that

But if you think that the supreme court of

Virginia applied the right rule, since Strickland is a

10

mixed question of fact and law, you must exercise plenary

review.
QUESTION:

May I ask this question:

13

a debate between the parties as to what the right rule is,

14

whether Strickland is Strickland by itself, or Strickland

15

as modified by Lockhart?

16

MR. GIBBONS:

There is a debate between the

17

parties on that, and I don't think it's much of a debate,

18

because I don't think you can fairly read Lockhart as

19

across-the-board modifying Strickland.

20

QUESTION:

No, but if the Virginia supreme court

21

did do that, then one could argue they applied the wrong

rule.

or the Fourth Circuit that relied on Lockhart?

3

MR. GIBBONS:

The supreme court of Virginia

relied on Lockhart.

5

2254(d)(1) to hold that if any justice or any judge could

6

imagine that the supreme court of Virginia was right,

7

2254(d)(1) requires a denial of habeas corpus relief, and

8

I suggest that is simply a misreading of congressional

9

intention.

QUESTION:

The Fourth Circuit relied on section

MR. GIBBONS:

Â¥

15

application of a rule of law to undisputed facts.

16

Justice Scalia, I suggest that that's not what

17

judges do.

18

law, but judges enter judgments, and sometimes they're not

19

unanimous, and if Congress were to tell you in, for

20

example, in exercising your section 1257 jurisdiction,

21

reviewing a State court judgment, that you can only

22

reverse a State court judgment if you're unanimous, I am

QUESTION:

They're not telling us how to decide

2

it, counsel, they are telling us not to decide it.

3

There's a difference between telling us how to decide a

4

case, which was Boerne, and telling us that we have no

5

jurisdiction over a case, which is what Congress is doing

6

in its habeas corpus statutes.

7

Now, it says in that statute, not contrary to

8

Federal law, which it seems to me is what you're saying.

9

They went out of their way to say that it has to be

10

contrary to clearly established Federal law.

11

to mean Federal law that is so clear that there's no room

12

for disagreement among reasonable judges as to what the

13

law requires, and if it doesn't mean that, I don't

14

understand what it means.

22

QUESTION:

But it would have been so easy for

23

Congress to use the language of Teague if that's what it

24

wanted to do.

25

This isn't the same language as Teague.

MR. GIBBONS:

Well, the language chosen -12

reasonable application, and clearly established and so
forth -- you find in the Teague line of cases, and I'll
grant you that this is not a model of clear statutory
draftsmanship, but on the other hand, when the President
looked at it, and in his signing statement interpreted it,
he read it to mean what we suggest, that it did not affect
the ability of this Court, or any Article III court, to
decide a pure question of law or a mixed question of fact
and law, all constitutional law.
QUESTION:

What deference do we give to signing

statements by the President?
MR. GIBBONS:

Well, Your Honor, considering the

amount of time and space that this Court has devoted to
the Presentment Clause, it seems -- it would seem to me to
be surprising not to treat a presidential signing
statement as a significant piece of legislative history.
The President was a participant in the legislative
process.
QUESTION:

Do any of our cases speak to that at

all, one way or the other?
MR. GIBBONS:

No, not -- well, I take that back.

version would have gone much further and might even have

4

achieved, at least from a point of view of a statute,

5

the -- what Virginia contends for, but that version was

6

rejected, and this language is clearly a compromise.
Now, there's no -- nothing new or startling

7
8

about compromises with respect to habeas corpus statutes.
In the 4

years that I've been at the bar, one side or the

10

other, there has never been a time when there wasn't

11

somebody in Congress trying to repeal the 1867 habeas

12

corpus statute, and the whole history of it is compromise,

13

and this is another compromise, and you simply should not

14

attribute to Congress an intention to tell an Article III

15

court how to decide an issue of constitutional law,

16

because there are enough lawyers in Congress who know that

17

they can't do that, and that is precisely what Virginia is

contending.

when Congress uses the word decision, a decision that was

contrary to clearly established law, what it was trying to

MR. GIBBONS:

I'll address the last ones first.

When Congress used the word decision, it obviously

This Court has long recognized that Congress has

the power to determine the scope of the habeas corpus

taking substantial measures to change the rule, to change

21

If I could briefly address what Congress said

they were doing in their statute before moving on to the

QUESTION:

10

MR. HARRIS:

Not specifically.
They didn't really focus on that.
Wright v. West was cited by the

opponents of the reform that were suggested in this bill

12

on the basis of Justice O'Connor's opinion that the

13

Federal courts should be exercising independent judgment

over the decisions raised in the Federal habeas petition.

15

Congress clearly was intending to present a

16

different rule.

17

reasonable applications of Federal law to the facts of a

18

particular case by the State courts, but if we look at the

1

particular amendments at the very end of the enactment of

20

this statute, we had Senator Kyi offering an amendment

21

which would have changed the standard we now see and

instead substituted an inadequate or ineffective State

At the other extreme, Senator Biden offered an

indeed, as a realistic compromise between the various

points of view, a middle level of deference, if you will,

That also was rejected.

between none and absolute.
Mr. Chief Justice, in response to your question

11
12

about the authority of the President to determine the

13

legislative intent in his action on the signing, I believe

14

that the rule is, where it is an administration bill, and

15

the President is responsible for presenting the bill to

16

Congress in the first place, that his opinion on what it

17

means, it may be given weight, but certainly when he is

18

merely offering an opinion on something that Congress has

decided independently, his opinion is not persuasive of

the legislative intent.

The problem I have is that this is

not usually how courts work, that this is a very different

approach for the Congress to impose on this Court, is it

not?

MR. HARRIS:

It is a different approach than

Congress has chosen to impose in the past, certainly in

the Federal habeas context, but it's not --

QUESTION:

In the Ornalis case, where we talked

about mixed questions of law and fact in the probable

18

necessary if we are to maintain control and to clarify

Federal principles.

MR. HARRIS:

And again, that is in the context

21

of a direct review system, and the direct process of

review between the trial, the probable cause

QUESTION:

2

Of course, competency cases usually

3

occur on collateral review, State and Federal, do they

4

not?
MR. HARRIS:

5

That is true, but we are now seeing

6

in several States, as anticipated by the capital case

7

provisions of the act, a process of unitary review, where

8

now claims of ineffective assistance of counsel can be

9

raised, in addition to the direct appeal claims, in one

10

proceeding, but still, as a matter of course, most States

11

would follow the practice of these competency claims being

12

raised in State collateral proceedings, but still subject

13

to this Court's review.

QUESTION:

If I understand your argument,

Mr. Harris, there could never be any determination that a

State court misapplied Strickland, because on your view

11

and the Fourth Circuit's view of what is contrary to

on all fours.
The bottom line in Strickland was that the

16

MR. HARRIS:

The court announced a standard, so

you could never have a case on all fours with Strickland

2

given that Strickland himself did not prevail?

3

MR. HARRIS:

It would be contrary to Strickland,

4

as the clearly established precedent of this Court, if the

State court failed to recognize and apply Strickland.

6

Once the State court has applied this Court's clearly

established precedent, it is a matter to be reviewed for

reasonableness for the result, the application of the

QUESTION:

Do you mean, then, that the Court

Congress was allowing a rule of deference,

reviewing court reason to doubt seriously whether or not
the State court correctly applied the correct law, or
unreasonably applied the correct law, what the Court in
effect is doing is a de novo review at that point, and

they're going to cite Strickland, they're going to at

What troubles me is, it seems to me your view,
and the view of the Fourth Circuit is that if the State
supreme court correctly cites the rule and says, we've
looked at the record and we think there's no prejudice
here, that the man was -- and we're reasonable judges,

that conclusion, there's no relief.

going to have a system that's so complicated that

virtually no trial judge is going to be able to administer

I think Congress has taken an

additional step beyond that, Justice Souter, by -- that -your suggestion that there may be highly unusual
particular cases outside the contrary-to, I would suggest
that it's the unreasonable applications here that is going
to provide the gist of the work for the Federal courts.
Where this Court has stated a specific rule for
deciding Federal claims, and the State court has correctly
identified and selected that as the rule prior to this
petitioner's claims, the only issue I think the Congress

mind is that Congress has given us both, because Congress

intended both to have an operative effect in this statute.
I think what we also need to keep in mind is

13

that the ordinary usage of the contrary-to in this type of

that Williams has actually offered this Court an

interpretation of 2254(d) that would have this Court

because Teague prior to the statute was just a judge-made

MR. HARRIS:

Well, Congress said they were

reforming existing law, and it's a nullity in that sense,

16

if you say it does no more than codify existing law.

17

Now, if I could address for a moment the

18

question of whether or not the Virginia supreme court did

19

pick the right law, Williams' argument in front of this

Court is that the Virginia supreme court erred.

21

erred in referring at all to Lockhart v. Fretwell in

Among other things, the State court -- no court that has
reviewed this case has ever suggested that the opinion of
Dr. Santora, as far as Williams' dangerousness in prison,
was a factor worth considering at all.

It has never been

identified as a factor.
All the trial court identified in the habeas as
worthy of a jury's consideration was the testimony of
additional character witnesses.

That was the finding of

the trial court, and he indicated that there was other

investigated and looked at to determine if additional

But what the habeas court relied on in its

witnesses, the character witnesses that trial counsel in
fact had presented in the sentencing phase of this trial.

of Strickland, is it, to say the circuit court was wrong

for adopting a per se approach?

16

MR. GIBBONS:

Well, if you read that in the

17

context of the trial court's decision, yes, it's wrong,

18

because what the trial court looked at was the fact that

the Virginia legislature had opted for a scheme in which
