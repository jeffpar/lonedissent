ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN L. COLEMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COLEMAN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit has adopted a per se waiver

11
12

rule.

Under all circumstances, a defendant waives her

13

right to seek any appellate review of her objection to a

14

district court's ruling admitting her prior conviction for

15

impeachment purposes if she attempts to mitigate the sting

16

of that evidence.

17

QUESTION:

The Ninth Circuit -You mean, when you say mitigate the

18

sting, when she gets on the stand and testifies herself

19

about it.

20

MR. COLEMAN:

Correct.

The Ninth Circuit has

21

articulated this rule, although it has relied on no

22

specific language in the Federal Rules of Evidence or the

23

Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

24

Solicitor General appears to concede that there is no such

25

specific language supporting such a rule.

Indeed, the

3

QUESTION:

Well, what specific language do you

rely on to support your position?
MR. COLEMAN:

We rely on the 1990 amendment to

4

Rule 609, which specifically removed the cross-examination

5

limitation with respect to when evidence could be admitted

6

under Rule 609.

7

QUESTION:

But that simply allowed the testimony

8

to come in on direct as -- as well as cross.

9

that support your position?

10

MR. COLEMAN:

How does

We believe it supports our

11

position because we do not think that Congress would have

12

intended to lay a trap for the unwary to on the one hand

13

specifically authorize attempts to mitigate the sting, but

14

on the other hand silently provide for the fact that such

15

attempts, which are authorized, constitute waivers of the

16

right to appeal without making any such indication in the

17

rules of evidence.

18

In addition, we also rely on Rule 103.

19

QUESTION:

I don't know, I mean, you really --

20

are most rules of waiver reflected in the Federal rules?

21

I mean, what you have here is a criminal defendant who

22

introduces this matter in the trial herself.

23

complain of its introduction?

24
25

MR. COLEMAN:

How can she

With respect to the first part of

the question, I believe that usually the waiver rules are

1

incorporated in the Federal rules.

For example, Federal

2

Rule of Criminal Procedure 12 has a specific provision

3

which indicates when a party specifically waives any

4

objections.
With respect to, how can a defendant actually

5
6

introduce the evidence and yet seek to appeal it, she is

7

only introducing the evidence after she has articulated an

8

objection, that objection has been overruled, and the only

9

possible reason why she would be admitting that evidence

10

is because the objection is overruled.
No criminal defendant in their right mind would

11

12

seek to put in evidence of a prior conviction.

13

extremely damaging evidence, and nobody would ever seek to

14

do that.

15

That's

In addition -QUESTION:

Well, we've held, haven't we, that

16

most rights generally are waivable?

17

doesn't take a specific provision allowing waiver in the

18

granting of the right for it to be waivable.

19

presumption in favor of waiver.

20

MR. COLEMAN:

In other words, it

I believe there's a presumption in

21

favor of the availability of waiver.

22

that there's a presumption in favor of waiver.

23

think the presumption --

QUESTION:

There's a

presumption in favor of waiver and a presumption as to the

2

availability of waiver?
MR. COLEMAN:

The difference is that with

3

respect to a presumption of the availability of waiver,

4

that means that unless there is a specific provision

5

saying that you cannot waive this, no ifs, ands, or buts,

6

waiver is available.

7

waiver in general means that if the rules are silent, for

8

example, you should presume that there will be no --

QUESTION:

However, if the presumption against

10

against waiver in general.

11

of waiver, our cases say.

16

MR. COLEMAN:

There's a presumption in favor

I believe Barker v. Wingo says

that the presumption is against waiver.
QUESTION:

Well, Barker v. Wingo was decided a

long time before the more recent cases.
MR. COLEMAN:

That is true.

Barker v. Wingo was

17

a 1972 case.

18

overruling that proposition.

19

that waiver is presumptively available, but I don't

20

believe that Mezzanatto took the additional step to

21

overrule Barker v. Wingo and to indicate that not only is

22

waiver presumptively available, but we also are going to

23

presume waiver.

24
25

However, I'm not aware of any cases

QUESTION:

Admittedly, Mezzanatto says

Oh, I don't -- I don't think it's a

matter of presuming waiver when it's your client herself

1

that put the evidence in.

2

about the Government's introducing the evidence when she

3

herself took the initiative in introducing it?

4

that's not a hard question as far as the issue of waiver

5

is concerned.
MR. COLEMAN:

6

How can she possibly complain

I --

Again, if she had not objected

7

beforehand to the introduction of this evidence and

8

received a ruling beforehand, then I agree, she would have

9

waived, but in this instance the only reason why she is

10

putting in the evidence is because she has articulated an

11

objection, that objection has been overruled.
QUESTION:

12

The Government might have decided

13

that its case was strong enough that it wouldn't take a

14

chance on the ruling and wouldn't introduce the evidence.

15

She took that option away from the Government by leaping

16

ahead.
MR. COLEMAN:

17

I believe on the record that we

18

have here there was absolutely no question that the

19

Government was going to use this conviction.

20

Government affirmatively moved to admit the conviction, as

21

opposed to a motion to exclude the conviction.
QUESTION:

22

The

Before it knew how the trial had

23

gone.

It might have concluded, after seeing how strong

24

its case looked and how well its witnesses did, not to

25

take a chance on this, that we didn't need it anyway.

Why

1

should it be precluded from deciding not to introduce it

2

by her jumping the gun?

3

MR. COLEMAN:

4

articulating a policy concern that was articulated in Luce

5

v. United States.

6

a defendant does not testify, an appellate court cannot

7

determine for sure whether a prosecutor would have used

8

the prior conviction.

9

\
i

I think that Your Honor is

I believe that Luce indicates that when

However, when the defendant does testify, an

10

appellate court can review the full and complete record,

11

which includes the defendant's testimony, and make a

12

determination as to whether the Government's case was so

13

strong that it never would have used the conviction.
QUESTION:

14

Mr. Coleman, could not the defense

15

have, to be sure about this, said to the judge, out of the

16

hearing of the jury, just before the defendant testified,

17

judge, I don't want to bring out this conviction if I can

18

avoid it, but if your ruling is going to stick, let me

19

know now?

20

by asking just before the testimony, Government, are you

21

going to bring this up, and then there would have been no

22

doubt about the definitiveness of the ruling, or the

23

Government's expectation of bringing it out on cross?

24
25

Couldn't he have confirmed the in limine ruling

MR. COLEMAN:

He could have done that.

However,

I don't think that such a sidebar or such a colloquy is

1

required, especially given the circumstances of this case,

2

given the Government's motion to admit the evidence, and

3

their claim that such evidence was critical and -- it was

4

important and critical evidence and, in addition, the

5

district court was clear that it was going to rule that

6

the prior conviction was admissible.

\

7

In fact, on the day that the defendant

8

testified, the district court specifically warned defense

9

counsel that obviously the prior conviction was

10

admissible, so in these particular circumstances, I do not

11

think that such a scenario was required.

12

QUESTION:

However --

Well, of course, even if that's true,

13

it wouldn't quite answer the problem that Justice Scalia

14

raised.

15

your colloquy you said, well, there's no question but that

16

the Government would have used this in its case.

17

rule you're proposing one in which there -- if there is

18

some question whether the Government would introduce the

19

evidence, there should be some sort of different result?

20

I want to go back to that for just a moment.

MR. COLEMAN:

Is the

I believe if the Government

21

articulates a question as to whether they are going to

22

admit the evidence beforehand, then that would be a

23

different result, yes.

MR. COLEMAN:

I don't believe so,

essentially three reasons.

the judge knows as much as

the judge can possibly know in weighing the relative

So I don't think the Government necessarily

would have to act in bad faith simply to say, we're not

make a representation.

world scenario?

I mean, that's conceivable, but that's

2

really not going to happen very often, is it?
QUESTION:

3

It seems to me the real-world

4

scenario is, if the Government has such a strong case it

5

doesn't need to use it, at the end of its case it simply

6

advises the judge, I've decided not to use this impeaching

7

evidence.

8

MR. COLEMAN:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

12

Exactly.

And then they would avoid this risk.

MR. COLEMAN:

Exactly, and we do believe it's

the Government's burden.
QUESTION:

Mr. Coleman, you sort of assume

13

throughout all of this that the defendant doesn't have to

14

pay a price for removing the sting.

15

absolute right to remove the sting, and you should not

16

lose anything by removing the sting.

17

there's that principle in our law.

18

You assume some

I don't know why

Let's assume the defendant knows that the

19

Government's going to introduce, you know, a bloody shirt,

20

so in order to remove the sting, the defendant himself

21

introduces the bloody shirt.

22

we would entertain an argument, well, after all, the

23

defendant only introduced it because he knew the

24

Government was going to introduce it, and therefore you

25

shouldn't be deemed to have waived any objection to it.

Now, you really think that

11

That doesn't seem to me like a sensible

1

2

principle.

If you want to remove the sting, remove it,

3

but don't come to the court and then say, we have an

4

objection to what we ourselves have put in.
MR. COLEMAN:

5

Well, for -- specifically with

6

respect to Rule 609 evidence, again, I think it does come

7

back to the 1990 amendment to Rule 609.

8

intended that a defendant should have to give something up

9

in order to remove the sting, one would think that

If Congress

10

Congress would have said so, rather than just specifically

11

authorizing such attempts to mitigate the sting.
QUESTION:

12

Why?

That's the normal rule.

You

13

have no basis for objecting to stuff that you've put in

14

yourself.

15

spell that out in order for that rule to be applied.

16

I mean, I don't know why you would have to

MR. COLEMAN:

We don't believe that that was the

17

normal rule, that in fact the Second Circuit and the D.C.

18

Circuits before the Federal Rules of Evidence were enacted

19

had specifically indicated that there was no waiver under

20

the circumstances.

21

QUESTION:

Is it relevant here or not -- I've

22

been thinking, not about Rule 609 but 103.

23

simply that there's a definitive ruling by the judge.

24

judge says, I rule, Government, you can admit this

25

evidence, and you wish under 103 to appeal that ruling.

My thought was
The

1

You can appeal the ruling if, and only if, it affects a

2

substantial right of the defendant, that it substantially

hurt the defendant, the ruling.

4

introduce it, it didn't hurt the defendant.

\

Ah, but wait a minute.

The defendant, because

6

of the threat, introduced it herself, so of course that

ruling affected a substantial right.

about what the Government would or wouldn't do, I guess

maybe it didn't affect a substantial right, but where

Now, that's how I've been thinking about it, but

13

don't let me think that way if I'm wrong on the basic

14

concept.

15

MR. COLEMAN:

I agree with the basic concept

16

that if there's a case where the evidence is so

17

overwhelming that an appellate court would take a look at

18

this and say, well, maybe the prosecutor would not have

19

used the conviction, in any event that error is going to

20

be harmless anyhow.

It's not going to affect a

21

substantial right.

I do agree that the Rule 103

22

substantially affecting language overlaps.

23

QUESTION:

Well, I was thinking that that's what

24

the case is about.

because there's a ruling that affected a substantial right

I certainly agree with --

Is that right?
Yes.

Don't let me think this way if I'm

making some error in the basic --

8

MR. COLEMAN:

9

QUESTION:

No, I agree with that.

When you assume that the defendant is

10

put to, into the position of bringing it out herself,

11

you're assuming something which I guess most of us assume,

12

and that is that she's really going to reap a significant

13

advantage by doing so.

14

There was at least one study cited, I guess, in

15

the Government's brief that calls that into question.

16

didn't read the study.

17

What's your response to that?

18

MR. COLEMAN:

I

I take it you probably have.

In response in our reply brief we

19

cited a study that conducted empirical studies which

20

contradicted the one article cited by the Solicitor

21

General.

22

in Old Chief talks about the devastating effect that a

litigant can have if the jury perceives that litigant as

I

That's correct, and it's standard

operating procedure for Government trial attorneys when

they use an informant or a cooperating witness.

often attempt to mitigate the sting, and we cited some

QUESTION:

Well, how about an interlocutory-

3

appeal of the type you described that might be taken under

MR. COLEMAN:

5

The problem is that under 3731 it

6

says that the Government can appeal a ruling that either

excludes or suppresses evidence.

admits a prior conviction of a Government witness, then I

don't believe they could appeal under 3731.

to me that the rule the Government is urging is really

Government is arguing and what the Ninth Circuit held was

1

Well, the district court says,

I'm

going to -- my good cause is, I might get reversed if I

3

make a mistake.

(Laughter.)

5

QUESTION:

Defer it from when?

I mean, may only

6

defer it for a good cause, to be sure, defer it from the

7

point at which he should have made the ruling, but really

8

the normal procedure is to make the ruling when the matter

9

comes up, and it's really a novel -- in the history of

10

civil procedure, a novel arrangement to have all of these

11

things presented before the trial, just a matter of

2

efficiency.

3

But the normal, and the final ruling on whether

4

to exclude or omit evidence is when it's introduced, and

5

Rule

introduced, well, I don't know whether it's properly let

in or not.

and I'll instruct the jury that it should have been

admitted.

QUESTION:

No, it's your question.

I was going

2

to say, he didn't have to make the ruling.

3

argument I thought was assuming that he has an obligation

4

to make that ruling in limine, and to my knowledge he has

no obligation to make the rule -- the rules allow him to

do so, but he has no obligation to do that.

MR. COLEMAN:

I mean, your

No, I hope I didn't misspeak.

We

agree, he does not have an obligation to render the ruling

at the in limine stage.

QUESTION:

Okay.

Then isn't -- why would it be

11

an abuse -- going back to Justice Kennedy's question, why

12

would it be an abuse of discretion if he --

13

MR. COLEMAN:

The only way I could ever foresee

14

that being abuse of discretion is, the way he posed the

15

hypothetical, a district court judge says, I am never,

16

ever going to consider this, consider a Rule 609 issue at

17

the in limine stage, and the only point I was trying to

18

make is that such a blanket statement could potentially

19

violate Rule 12 (e), because Rule 12 (e) says that motions

that are made before trial should be entertained before

2

I'm just -- that's my good cause.
MR. COLEMAN:

3

I agree, that generally will be --

4

that will be enough.

5

almost all cases, if the district court wants to defer, it

6

certainly has the power to defer.
QUESTION:

7

That will be good cause, and in

Well, isn't that what it is likely to

8

do if you win your case, or perhaps let me give you a

9

second alternative, or maybe a variant on Justice

10

11

Kennedy's.
Either the judge is going to say, look, I'm

12

going to -- I'm going to wait until the evidence is

13

offered before I make a ruling, or the judge is going to

14

say, I will entertain an in limine ruling, and I will make

15

one before trial, but it is subject to reconsideration

16

when we get closer to the point of introduction, and I

17

will not make a final ruling until the moment comes that

18

the Government offers it, because only then can I make the

19

most intelligent judgment about the relative prejudice and

20

probative force.

21

That would certainly I take it the latter

22

position would not be an abuse of discretion, and so isn't

23

a cautious judge going to take that position?

25

MR. COLEMAN:

A judge could take that position.

There are many reasons why a

QUESTION:

If you win.

MR. COLEMAN:

10

Number 1, the judge --

The judge may believe that a

11

definitive ruling at the in limine stage will help the

12

parties settle the case, so he doesn't even have to go

13

through a whole trial and then an appeal.

think that in fairness the parties should have such a

ruling so that if the Government wants to take an

the outset.

He asked for briefing, he had an oral

argument on the issue, and then he made a ruling that he
considered definitive, but he said it's a close call.
Is there -- relevant in this picture at all that
maybe district judges would like to know what the law is,
so that's a reason for saying, if the judge has made a
definitive ruling that he called a close call, there
should be appellate review?
MR. COLEMAN:

We certainly agree, and that hits

home with our point with respect to Rule 102, that one of
the purposes in construing the rules that Rule 102
indicates is that we should further the progress and
development of the law of evidence.
And this is a classic case, where the district
court had real trouble determining whether a prior
conviction for simple possession of drugs is probative of
veracity, and this is exactly the type of reason why we do
not want to have blanket waivers of the right to appeal.
There will be no development of the Rule 609 case law
under those circumstances, so we certainly do agree with
that.
Your Honors, if there are no more questions, I'd
like to save the remaining time for rebuttal.

Very well, Mr. Coleman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL

MS. McDOWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A criminal defendant who chooses to reveal his

6

prior conviction on direct examination waives any claim of

7

error with respect to its admission.

8

undisputed rule where the district court has not ruled in

That's the

limine on the admissibility of the conviction, for it's
10

well-settled that a party cannot introduce adverse

11

evidence as its own for its own tactical purposes and then

12

challenge the admission of the evidence on appeal.

13

There's no reason to depart from that sensible rule where,

on the admissibility of a conviction.

MS. McDOWELL:

that even with respect to those evidentiary issues that

MS. McDOWELL:

Yes, but she can diffuse it in

other ways as well, as I was saying, by her explanation of

the conviction on redirect, by the way she answers the

introducibility of prior convictions.

MS. McDOWELL:

QUESTION:

Yes.

The question would --

Yes, but our question is not the

correctness of the introduction.

there is a right to claim that it is not correct, and I

take it that the response to Justice Stevens would be,

that the admission ruling is correct, but certainly the

QUESTION:

put, where just at the close of the direct examination of

the defendant by the defendant's own attorney he says,

there's one more question, and the judge turns in a --

what do they call these now? -- sidebar to the prosecution

7

and says, now, do you propose to introduce the prior

conviction, and the prosecutor says, well, I'm going to

9

wait and see.

Can the prosecutor do that?

MS. McDOWELL:

10

S3

In the hypothetical Justice Breyer

Yes, because in many

11

circumstances, or at least some circumstances, the

12

prosecutor may want to know how the rest of the cross-

13

examination goes.

14

conviction is not necessary if the impeachment goes well

15

on other matters, or if for some other reason during

16

cross-examination the introduction of the prior conviction

seems particularly problematic, and a prosecutor should be

able to preserve the option to decide later in cross-

MS. McDOWELL:

The Court held that a defendant

could be required to choose whether to take the stand, be

impeached with a prior conviction, and preserve the

19

objection for appeal, or alternatively choose not to

20

testify and abandon the issue, and the Court said that was

permissible.

QUESTION:

Of course, one of the problems with

Luce was that if the Court had ruled the other way, every

defendant would have announced that but for the ruling he

would have taken the stand.

He would be given a, sort of

Here, you know the defendant's taking the stand,

2
3

so at least that uncertainty is eliminated.

MS. McDOWELL:

QUESTION:

6

And that makes this a harder case

than Luce, it seems to me.
MS. McDOWELL:

That's correct.

It may be, but there's still the

question of not knowing whether the district court
actually would have admitted the conviction or whether the

Government would have tried to introduce it.

MS. MCDOWELL:
QUESTION:

Is that a waiver?

Yes, it is.

Yes, and the case that I -- I just

look that up in a regular treatise.
MS. McDOWELL:

Is that just obvious?

The issue has generally arisen

after motions in limine have been decided on the matter,
specifically with respect to prior convictions.

I'm not

aware of a lot of case law that deals with matters other
than that.
QUESTION:

I mean, you could think it would come

doesn't have to be prior convictions.
All sorts of trials are managed because -- yeah,
because you know, there's whole vast realms of complicated
evidence.

the -- in reaction to that, you introduce it yourself,
