ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case concerns a recurring problem in

11

12

Federal jury selection:

13

judge to dismiss a potential juror for cause, followed by

14

the defendant's exercise of a peremptory challenge to

15

remove that juror.

16

the erroneous refusal of a trial

The Ninth Circuit held in this case that that

17

sequence of events requires automatic reversal of a

18

conviction whenever the defendant goes on to exhaust his

19

peremptory challenges during jury selection.

20

with that result for three alternative theories.

We disagree

First, the use of a peremptory challenge to

21
22

exclude a juror who should have been excused for cause is

23

not a denial or impairment of the peremptory challenge

24

right, but is a proper purpose for which the challenge is

25

used.

Second, assuming that there is an impairment of

1
2

the peremptory challenge right in a case like this one,

3

that impairment does not warrant reversal of an otherwise

4

fair trial where the jury that is actually empaneled and

5

sits is impartial within the meaning of the Sixth

6

Amendment.

7

And third, even if there is a case in which,

8

despite the impartiality of the jury that sits, there

9

might be an error in the peremptory challenge process that

10

affects substantial rights, no such effect should be found

11

in a case like this one where the defendant had concededly

12

untrammeled use of 9 out of 10 of his peremptory

13

challenges and never indicated on the record that he

14

objected to any panel member that was actually empaneled

15

and seated on the jury.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, you -- you mentioned I

17

think peremptory challenge right impairment.

18

source of those peremptory challenge rights?

19

MR. DREEBEN:

What is the

The source of peremptory challenge

20

rights in the Federal system is rule 24 of the Federal

21

Rules of Criminal Procedure which provides a right of

22

peremptory challenge to the defense in criminal cases that

23

increases in number depending on the type of case that

24

there is.

25

Now, rule 24 does not, by its terms, spell out

1

what procedures trial courts should use to administer the

2

peremptory challenge process.

3

made it clear that trial courts have discretion to

4

formulate appropriate procedures.

5

QUESTION:

And this Court has long

I take it then it really is

6

impossible to justify the Ninth Circuit's reasoning if

7

there's a constitutional question here where we're talking

8

about Federal rules.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

That's right, Mr. Chief Justice.

10

The -- the only impairment that is conceivable on this

11

record in our view would be of the rule 24 right of

12

peremptory challenge.

13

converted what it thought was a violation of the rule into

14

a due process problem by reasoning that any time a

15

defendant is deprived of a rule-based right, the defendant

16

is also deprived of a procedural right protected by the

17

Constitution.

18

ever endorsed in its analysis of a variety of rule-based

19

and statutory rights, particularly in the context of

20

Federal habeas corpus.

21

The Ninth Circuit,

in effect,

That is not a theory that this Court has

QUESTION:

And as a --

But as far as rules are concerned,

22

Mr. Dreeben, this case is -- is perhaps larger than -- on

23

the face because the same peremptory challenge by rule, by

24

Federal rule, exists on the civil side.

25

argument today based on the consequences of not allowing a

1

challenge for cause improperly -- does that -- would that

2

follow equally for civil peremptory for-cause challenges?

3

MR. DREEBEN:

Certainly, Justice Ginsburg,

I

4

think that the rule that -- that we are arguing for today

5

would apply equally,

6

civil context.

7

if not even more strongly,

in the

This Court has already made clear in the

8

McDonough v. Greenwood case that errors in the voir dire

9

process that might impair the intelligent exercise of

10

peremptory challenges do not rise to the level of harmful

11

error requiring reversal of a -- of a civil judgment.

12

the principle that the Court applied in that case is that

13

the cost to society, to the courts, to the litigants is

14

too high to reverse a conviction simply because an error

15

in the jury selection process might have infringed a

16

party's desire to remove a particular juror on a

17

peremptory basis rather than for cause.

18

Now,

And

if the error in question in jury selection

19

actually results in the seating of a biased juror and the

20

defendant has adequately preserved that challenge, that is

21

an entirely different case because that case goes to the

22

heart of what the Sixth Amendment protects for the

23

defendant.

24
25

QUESTION:
object and say,

Do you adequately preserve it if you

I want an extra peremptory?

Suppose --

1

suppose the biased juror is seated wrongfully.

2

peremptories have been exercised and you ask for an

3

additional peremptory.

4

right?

5

MR. DREEBEN:

All the

Is -- is that preserving your

Well, in our view it would -- it

6

would not result in an error that would require reversal

7

of the conviction.

8

10

QUESTION:

Even if you have no peremptories left

and the judge doesn't give you one?
MR. DREEBEN:

Unless the -- the juror who you

11

would have exercised the peremptory against is in fact a

12

biased juror so that he sits on the jury --

13

QUESTION:

No, no.

14

MR. DREEBEN:

I'm assuming that he didn't.

If he does not -- if he does not

15

sit on the jury, our position is that the claim may be

16

preserved, but the claim doesn't warrant relief because

17

the costs to society are simply too high to reverse a

18

conviction simply because a defendant has been deprived

19

of, in that -- in the hypothetical that Your Honor has

20

given, one peremptory challenge.

21
22

23

QUESTION:

So, there's never any prejudice.

There will never be any prejudice.
MR. DREEBEN:

There will be prejudice, Justice

24

Souter, if in fact the defendant is forced by virtue of

25

the exhaustion of peremptory challenges to accept a juror

Okay.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

If the Court accepts our primary

8

harmless error theory that the only cognizable harm that

9

the defendant can assert is the deprivation of an

10

impartial jury, that's correct.

11

Now, we have a fall-back --

12

QUESTION:

But in -- in effect, you -- that --

13

that says,

14

that you can pursue is the issue of a biased juror whom

15

you have claimed should have been excused for cause.

16

forget peremptories.

MR. DREEBEN:

The -- the only issue

it doesn't

There is a rule-based right that's at issue

QUESTION:

Well,

I think it says, forget them if

21

the judge doesn't let you have them because the only issue

22

that can be pursued is the issue of the biased juror who

23

should have been excused for cause.

25

MR. DREEBEN:

Well,

there are a variety of

different scenarios that could come up.

system, if a judge announced at the outset of the trial,

2

which I'm not aware that any judge has done, but if the

3

judge announced at the outset of the trial, in my

4

courtroom we simply don't have peremptory challenges, I

5

think they're a waste of time and inefficient, I would

6

assume that a defendant would be able to pursue a

7

extraordinary writ in a court of appeals and have that

8

error corrected.

9

QUESTION:

What if he -- what if he doesn't --

10

what if he, in fact, goes to trial?

11

of the trial, he would get no relief on your theory,

12

absent the seating of a biased juror who should have been

13

excused for cause anyway.

14

MR. DREEBEN:

I take it at the end

That's correct, and I would expect

15

that the appellate court would write a rather strong

16

opinion that would admonish that trial judge and others in

17

the circuit not to flout the rules of procedure.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, what if --

19

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose under your rule it

20

works the other way around because if -- if -- I suppose

21

the trial judge could say, you know, there's a lot of

22

close for-cause issues here.

23

you people exercise your peremptories first and then I'll

24

rule on the for-cause.

25

MR. DREEBEN:

I'm not sure.

You guys --

Well, I think that a defendant

1

would have a different objection in that case, which would

2

be that there the -- the judge had essentially changed the

3

way the peremptory challenges were -- were administered

4

under settled rules of the common law, and therefore he

5

could tell the judge that that is not the way that

6

peremptory challenges are administered.

7

Now, the question --

QUESTION:

Would he get a reversal on appeal?

QUESTION:

Would he get an appeal?

10

QUESTION:

That's -- that's the issue.

11

you would say still no reversal --

MR. DREEBEN:

QUESTION:

You --

That's right.

-- on appeal unless there's been

strike a biased juror.

objection that he does not use his last peremptory to

1

Now,

is it the Government's position

that he -- that there's no harm because he had a

peremptory which he could have used to strike that biased

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that would be our

position, Justice Scalia, but it's important to

distinguish --

QUESTION:

Do you have a fall-back position?

Because that one is not very attractive.

10

(Laughter.)

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. DREEBEN:

So, what's your second position?
Well, Justice O'Connor, that --

13

that fact scenario was not actually the fact scenario of

14

this case, and I would -- would agree that it is a far

15

more serious intrusion upon the defendant's rights and

16

upon the integrity of the judicial system if a biased

17

juror actually sits on the panel.

18

have determined that in the administration of the

19

peremptory challenge process, there should be no

20

gamesmanship about whether a biased juror sits or doesn't

sit.

There are States that

1

MR. DREEBEN:

Our fall-back harmless error

2

position is that the question in a case in which the

3

defendant is claiming that his peremptory challenge rights

4

have been infringed is whether there is a significant

5

enough effect on those rights to justify setting aside the

6

conviction.

7

QUESTION:

You don't have to retreat that far in

8

order to overcome the objection that Justice O'Connor and

9

I find rather -- rather significant.

That is to say, you

10

can still maintain your first position on harmless error

11

without going the further step to say,

moreover, even when

12

a biased juror is

one peremptory left

13

that you could have used to strike him, that -- that is

14

harmless error.

I mean, that -- that goes beyond what --

it seems to me what you -- what you need to say in order

16

to sustain this case under your -- under your -- your

17

primary theory.

18

Your primary theory is if a biased juror is

19

seated, there's harm.

you, biased juror has been seated, but you're trying to,

21

you know, take a bigger bite and say, moreover, it doesn't

even matter if a biased juror is seated so long as you had

23

a peremptory left

24

I -- I don't know why youhave to go that far.

25

And in the hypothetical I've given

which you couldhave

I can't say this would

MR. DREEBEN:

I

That's what a

And that you -- you say
Just too bad.

Essentially, Justice Ginsburg,

17

where the Ninth Circuit and the Government disagree on

18

this case is how serious an injury that is to the fairness

19

of the trial.

20

regardless of how fair the actual unfolding of the trial

21

process is, whether the defendant had counsel who

22

performed effectively, introduced the evidence that he

23

wanted to introduce, got an opportunity to cross examine

24

the Government's witnesses, and had a impartial jury

25

within the Sixth Amendment -- the Ninth Circuit's position

The Ninth Circuit's position is that

1

is, despite all of that, the impairment of a rule-based,

2

non-constitutional peremptory challenge, even a single

3

one, requires tossing out the entire results of the trial

4

and starting over.

5

Our position is simply that that is far too high

6

a price to pay in a case in which the error does not

7

affect the fundamental fairness of the trial, as an

8

infringement of peremptory challenges does not.

9

This Court has reserved the category of

10

structural error, error that justifies setting aside the

11

results of a trial even though one cannot determine any

12

effect on the outcome, for very serious and deep

13

constitutional injuries to the fundamental structure of

14

the trial, such as the total denial of counsel, or the

15

sitting of a biased judge, or the denial of a proper

16

reasonable doubt instruction, the kind of error that

17

fundamentally infects the trial with unfairness or

18

unreliability.

19

Our position is that the denial or infringement

20

of a single peremptory challenge simply does not rise to

21

that level.

22

QUESTION:

But in this case, even the -- I think

23

you -- you gave us at the outset three stopping points.

24

In this case you could say, well, even if that were the

25

rule, this doesn't make it because -- because this

MR. DREEBEN:

12

this case there was no request for an additional

peremptory challenge to use it against any other juror,

14

and even if there might be an opportunity for the Court to

consider reversing a conviction merely because of the

impairment of peremptory challenges,

justify throwing out the results of an otherwise fair

that there's any question that in our view the most that

could be said is that there was an infringement of a rule-

based right.

4

The first position that we have for the Court's

5

consideration is that Federal law ought to be construed

6

the same way that Oklahoma law was construed in Ross v.

7

Oklahoma, which is to say that the peremptory challenge

8

should properly be regarded as serving the purpose of

9

protecting the impartiality of the jury.
QUESTION:

10

But, Mr. Dreeben, there's not a word

11

in the advisory committee note that suggests that the

12

Federal peremptory challenge was to be used when the judge

13

makes an error for cause.

14

if you read the Federal rules, on the civil side and on

15

the criminal side, they say, you have X number of

16

peremptory challenges.

17

MR. DREEBEN:

That was the Oklahoma law.

But

Oklahoma law was the same, Justice

18

Ginsburg.

19

that governed the court that determined whether there

20

would be a procedural error if the defendant had to use a

21

peremptory challenge to cure a for-cause strike, or to put

22

it another way, whether once a defendant does cure the

23

error in the for-cause denial, he has been deprived of

24

anything protected under the rules.

25

There was nothing in the statutes or the rules

Well, Justice Scalia, I don't

think that I have to have both halves of that rule.
QUESTION:

Since you're talking about -- about

10

the Oklahoma rule and you're saying that the Federal

11

statute should be interpreted the same way, I assume

12

that's how you want us to interpret the Federal statute.

13

MR. DREEBEN:

I would have that interpretation,

14

but I don't think that it's essential that the Court agree

15

with that in order to agree that there is no infringement

16

of the peremptory challenge when the defendant actually

17

does what he does in this case because assuming that he

18

could get review if he lets the biased juror sit on the

19

jury and he actually has a fact-finder who doesn't satisfy

20

the Sixth Amendment and this Court determines that's an

21

error that warrants review either under reserved --

22

preserved error or plain error, it doesn't mean that he

should also have the opportunity of having it the other

way, actually using his peremptory challenge to remove

Most of the courts that have adopted a rule of

1

2

automatic reversal for these sorts of errors in the

3

peremptory challenge process have relied on Swain v.

4

Alabama and on dictum that appears in that decision in

5

which the court said that the denial of the peremptory

6

challenge is so important that it warrants a reversal

7

without any further showing of error.
Now Swain, of course, didn't involve any

8

9

question of an infringement of the defense peremptory

10

challenges.

That statement had no relationship to the

11

facts of the case.
But Swain was citing and relying on cases from

12

13

the 19th century that had reversed convictions without any

inquiry into whether there was harmful error.

The other category of harmless error analysis is

what the Court has sometimes referred to as structural

error which is the sort of fundamental deprivation of the

the Court does not look to see whether there is an effect

on the outcome of the case.

And in that context,

Reversal is automatic.

The Ninth Circuit has sorted out this error into

when the defense counsel and the Government are exercising

But there could have been a

there wasn't.

12

MR. GORDON:

And I agree with that.

point is that, A, the defendant -- or the defense counsel

It's a buffer for the defendant.

in this case that the right to a peremptory challenge is

it allows the defendant to play a role in his jury

respect.

And the reason why it's essential is that

It really

And we've recognized -- this Court has
continually recognized that a trial by jury deserves a

peremptory challenge.

In fact, this Court in Holland

11

stated that although the Court previously in Stilson said

12

it was not a necessary right under the Sixth Amendment, it

13

arguably is a substantive right and that the right is so

essential that it does not -- the right to peremptory

Well,

I don't -- I don't believe

that.

It's a matter of it being arbitrarily denied.

MR. GORDON:

I think that is perfectly

Justice, that the rule has been amended, and I think --

Exactly.

Would that be a

MR. GORDON:

I don't think so.

Chief Justice's position that it was an amended rule and

it was amended appropriately.

my view is amended by Congress, or at least amended under

no -- certainly no procedural due process violation.

And so long as the rule in

Mr. Gordon, maybe I shouldn't waste

your time with this because you're not relying exclusively

on the constitutional violation.

how there can be a constitutional violation if you accept

that the rule, as rewritten pursuant to the Chief

But I don't understand

Justice's hypothetical, would be constitutional; that is,

11

if -- if what the Government argues had been written into

12

the statute, you acknowledge that would be -- that would

13

be constitutional.

14

written into the statute, to interpret the statute that

way would somehow be unconstitutional or -- or how can you

16

get a constitutional violation once you acknowledge that

17

this could happen if expressly approved by Congress?

18

But you say that since it is not

MR. GORDON:

Well, let me just state it this

19

way.

In order for the rule to be expressly approved by -

20

- or in order for the rule to be amended, it has to be

21

expressly approved by Congress.

22

we're looking at rule 24 as it now exists today without

our interpretation is correct, the deprivation of the

I think the -- the point I'm trying

5

to make is there are -- as Chief Justice Rehnquist points

6

out, there are some cases more on the fringe when we're

7

dealing with very fundamental rights where the erroneous

8

denial of a procedural right can rise to a procedural due

9

process violation.
And -- and I agree with you, Justice Scalia, we

10

11

don't have to go that far.

decide that rule 24, if it were to be amended, ought to be

amended in -- in accordance with procedure and that we had

a violation of rule 24 in that instance.

QUESTION:

I think all we need to do is

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. DREEBEN:

There are many things that a trial

6

judge can do in orchestrating jury selection that have

7

effects on the defendant's peremptory challenges that are

8

equally severe, if not more severe than this one.

9

The trial judge, can in a multi-defendant case

10

require all the defendants to exercise their peremptory

11

challenges together without extending any additional

12

challenges so that each defendant is reduced down from the

13

number, in effect, of 10 provided in the rule to 5 because

14

he's sharing with another defendant.

15

The trial judge can require the parties to

16

select the jury by exercising their challenges

17

simultaneously, which is in fact what happened in this

18

case.

19

challenges against somebody who would have been removed by

20

the Government in any event.

And in that event, the defendant may exercise his

21

And the trial judge can say to the parties, you

22

must make a challenge for cause and then instantaneously,

23

if it's denied, exercise a peremptory challenge, and if

24

you do -- don't do that, you may not challenge that juror.

25

Each of these entirely legitimate procedures may

1

from the defendant's point of view,

2

otherwise be his free and untrammeled right to exercise

3

peremptory challenges.

4

which is that if the defendant does actually exercise his

5

peremptory challenge to remove a juror who should have

6

been removed for cause, he cannot claim error on appeal.

7

He has been given the substance of the right and there is

8

no basis for reversing the conviction.

The rule that we ask for here,

Thank you.
