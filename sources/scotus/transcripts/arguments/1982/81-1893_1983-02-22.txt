ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARLEY D. MAYFIELD, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

And, we are hearing California

against Ramos.

Mr. Mayfield, I think you may

MR. MAYFIELD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The Respondent was sentenced to death for first-degree

10

murder during the commission of a robbery.

11

duty employees at a fast food restaurant where he worked, after

12

which he shot both of them in the head, and one of them lived.

13

He was convicted of two counts of robbery, attempted

He robbed the on-

14

murder, and murder of the first degree, along with a special

15

allegation that the murder was committed during the commission

16

of a robbery.

17

first degree is punishable by 25 years to life, unless certain

18

special circumstances are alleged and found true beyond a reason­

19

able doubt.

20

or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.

21

penalty is determined at a separate hearing in which the trier

22

of fact is a jury unless waived by both parties.

23

Under the California Penal Code, murder of the

In which case, the alternative penalties are death
The

At that separate hearing both parties may present

24

additional evidence, and the statute provides for certain

25

specified aggravating and mitigating factors which the jury must
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

consider in addition to an additional catch-all factor permitting

2

the jury to consider any factor in litigation.

3

If the aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating

4

circumstances, the jury is required to return a verdict of death.

5

If mitigating circumstances outweigh aggravating circumstances,

6

the jury is required to return a verdict of life imprisonment

7

without possibility of parole.

8
9
10

The trial judge may modify a verdict of death to one
of life without the possibility of parole; although if the jury
returns the lesser punishment, it cannot be increased.

11

The statute also requires that the trier of fact be

12

instructed that the punishment of life imprisonment without

13

possibility of parole may in the future be modified by the

14

governor to include a lesser sentence which permits the possibility

15

of parole.

16

In this case, defense counsel objected to that

17

instruction being given on the ground that it violated his right

18

to due process of law, and the trial judge overruled the objection

19

on the ground it was required by statute.

20

to the California Supreme Court, the Court expressly and exclusively

21

reversed the death penalty on the ground that the portion of the

22

statute which required the giving of that instruction violated

23

the defendant's right to due process under the 5th, 8th, and 14th

24

Amendments for two reasons.

25

On automatic appeal

One, that it introduced an extraneous factor into the
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

jury's deliberations.

2

it did not require an instruction, because the instruction did not

3

inform the jury that the governor could also commute a sentence

4

of death to a lesser sentence.

5

And, second, that it was misleading because

The issue presented on Certiorari to this Court is

6

whether enforcement of that statutory provision requiring

7

instruction violates the 5th, 8th, and 14th Amendments.

8
9

This Court's cases indicate that due process is
violated whenever a defendant is deprived of some guaranteed

10

right, or if a procedure is fundamentally unfair.

11

cases which sort of blend the 5th, the 14th, and 8th Amendment

12

principles, cases have held that a procedure which increases the

13

likelihood of an arbitrary, a capricious, or unreliable sentencing

14

determination may violate due process.

15

tinction this Court has drawn between capital cases and others on

16

the ground that the death sentence is unique in its finality.

17

In the capital

There is a basic dis­

A subsidiary question under the question presented on

18

Certiorari, since this is a state statutory procedure, is the

19

question whether the statute clearly and unmistakably violates

20

the defendant's due process rights.

In California's alternative sentences, the sentence of

22

death, the meaning is quite clear.

perpetually imprisoned — imprisoned until death.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Mayfield, is the phrase "life imprisonment

4

without possibility of parole" a word of art in California juris­

5

prudence, or something to that effect?

6

MR. MAYFIELD:

It is, Your Honor, in the sense that

7

it does not literally mean what it says.

8

sentence of life imprisonment permits a consideration for parole

9

after seven years.

10

In California law, a

The sentence of life imprisonment without possibility

11

of parole for murder was not available in California until 1977.

12

Previously, that sentence was only imposed on certain aggravated

13

forms of kidnapping.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. MAYFIELD:

16

QUESTION:

17

And, that was by referendum, wasn't it?

I mean it was referendum -- it was not

debated or anything?

18

MR. MAYFIELD:

QUESTION:

20

MR. MAYFIELD:

21

QUESTION:

22

Initiative, yes,Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor, there was —

Well, it was not debated in the legislature?
No, Your Honor, not in the legislature.

Is there any possibility of parole for a

person who is sentenced to life without possibility of parole?

23

MR. MAYFIELD:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. MAYFIELD:

Yes, Your Honor, there is.

He can be paroled?
He can be paroled because of the
6

statutory and constitutional provisions for the governor to

2

commute his sentence.

3
4

QUESTION:

Is the commutation by the governor con­

sidered a parole?

5

MR. MAYFIELD:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. MAYFIELD:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

The governor can commute the sentence —

Can the governor put him on parole?
No, Your Honor.

So, that the life sentence without possibility

of parole is really accurate, isn't it, because he cannot be
paroled?

11

MR. MAYFIELD:

12

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, it is not accurate.

Parole is quite different from the commuta­

13

tion of the sentence, is it not?

14

MR. MAYFIELD:

15

QUESTION:

MR. MAYFIELD:

Yes, Your Honor.

Or it may be commuted

to a sentence of 25 years to life.

20
21

It may just be commuted to a sentence of

life imprisonment?

18
19

The sentence may be

commuted to a sentence which includes the possibility of parole.

16
17

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

In which event the parole would be a possi­

bility?

22

MR. MAYFIELD:

23

The term "without possibility of parole" is on its face

Yes, Your Honor.

24

misleading because it is not literally true that the person given

25

the sentence may never be paroled -7

QUESTION:

Incidentally, did I understand you to say

that a death sentence, too, may be commuted by the governor to a

parole?

MR. MAYFIELD:

sentence, life without possibility of parole, or --

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. MAYFIELD:

8

QUESTION:

9

It may be commuted by the governor to a

Life sentence?
Yes, that is correct.

So, in the latter instance, he also could

be admitted to parole?

10

MR. MAYFIELD:

11

QUESTION:

That is correct.

Is there any difference between the

12

governor's considering commutation or life without parole in a

13

death penalty if both done the same way by the governor?

14

MR. MAYFIELD:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Not necessarily --

I mean are there different standards or

criteria or anything?
MR. MAYFIELD:

The governor can set his own criteria.

18

Although, for individuals sentenced to life without parole, there

19

are provisions within the Department of Corrections — regulations

20

for them to consider and make recommendations.

21

vast difference in that there is relatively a small window for

22

the governor to commute death sentence, during this period after

23

all the appeals have expired and a period when the sentence is to

24

be carried.

25

There is also a

On the other hand, every individual who is in prison
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

under a sentence of life imprisonment without parole, always

2

retains the possibility that he may be commuted and not spend the

3

rest of his life in prison.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Mayfield, did the Supreme Court of

5

California in its analysis of the federal constitutional question

6

differentiate between the first and the second sentence of the

7

so-called Briggs instruction?

8

MR. MAYFIELD:

9

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor —

The reason I — Let me read you the first

10

sentence, which you are doubtless very familiar with.

11

instructed under the state constititution, "A governor is

12

empowered to grant a reprieve, pardon, or commutation of the

13

sentence following conviction of a crime."

14

statement of fact, isn't it, that the governor could commute a

15

death sentence.

16

He could commute any sentence?

You

That is simply a

He could commute a life sentence without parole.

17

MR. MAYFIELD:

18

QUESTION:

That is correct.

Did the Supreme Court of California feel

19

that instruction was misleading?

20

MR. MAYFIELD:

No.

I believe not.

They believe what

21

was misleading is the fact that that is merely, I believe, a lead-

22

in to the operative part of the instruction which says that a

23

sentence of life imprisonment without parole may be —

24
25

QUESTION:
it.

Well, the instruction has two sentences in

At least the California Supreme Court did not object to the
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

first of the two sentences?

2

MR. MAYFIELD:

I believe the California Supreme Court

3

objects to the entire instruction because of the view that any

4

part of the instruction puts an extraneous factor into the jury's

5

consideration.

6

QUESTION:

So, you think its holding extends to holding

7

the first sentence of the instruction unconstitutional on federal

8

constitutional grounds?

9

MR. MAYFIELD:

10

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, I believe so.

So, you get the same result if the instructic n

11

said, the governor may commute any sentence, including a sentence

12

of death?

13

MR. MAYFIELD:

14

QUESTION:

15

That is essentially what the instruction says,

doesn't it?

16

MR. MAYFIELD:

17

does not differentiate.

18
19

20

I believe so, yes.

QUESTION:

The first part of the instruction

The governor can commute anything, including

a death sentence?
MR. MAYFIELD:

Yes.

It does, in fact, say that.

But,

21

it does not specifically refer to the death sentence whereas the

22

second part of the instruction does.

23

From the standpoint of the alternatives offered, I

24

believe it is reasonable to consider that the determination by

25

a sentencer will in some way be affected by the sentencer's
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

perception of the alternatives that he is choosing between.

2

example, in Beck v. Alabama where the jury could only return a

3

verdict of guilty of a capital offense, even though there was

4

evidence from which a lesser offense could be returned, this

5

Court found that that would skew the determination.

6

that the determination of the jury's verdict could be skewed also

7

if the jury believed that the difference between the alternative

8

punishments is minimal.

9

For

I believe

For instance, it would be impermissible under the

10

California statute for a juror who was convinced that aggravating

11

circumstances outweighed

12

sentence of life imprisonment without possible parole because he

13

believed that was a more severe sentence.

14

people may think that, but I suggest there are some.

15

mitigating circumstances to impose a

Probably, not too many

Similarly, it would be impermissible under the

16

California statute for a juror who was convinced that mitigating

17

circumstances outweighed aggravated circumstances to impose the

18

punishment of death, because he thought he was doing the defen­

19

dant a favor.

20

In this case, the defendant himself, at least, told at Uas

21

his psychiatrist that he would rather have the death penalty

22

than life without parole.

23

There is a probability that a large percentage — a

24

substantial percentage — of jurors will be aware of California

25

law, and will, in any event, realize that there is a power of
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

commutation of sentences of life without parole — that there is

2

a possibility of parole.

3

California to decide that it is preferable if every juror in every

4

case is aware of that by manner of a simple instruction which tell s

5

them this fact.

6
7

8
9

But, I think it is reasonable for

When we speak of the liability of sentencing determina­
tions, I think that consistency is of some significance.
As to the other part of the California Supreme Court's
decision that the instruction is misleading, I believe it is

10

significant that trial counsel below did not make that argument.

11

And, I suggest the reason possibly is set forth in the California

12

Supreme Court's decision in People v. Morse, back in 60 Cal 2d,

13

where they said since people probably know something about

14

parole, you should tell the jury that there is a possibility of

15

parole, but tell them that is not supposed to be what they base

16

their decision on.

17

They should not take that into consideration.

On the other hand, you should not tell a jury about the

18

power of a trial judge, or the California Supreme Court, or the

19

governor to commute a sentence of death --

20
21

22

QUESTION:

Was that earlier decision you were referring

to, Mr. Mayfield, based on federal constitutional grounds?
MR. MAYFIELD:

No, that was based on the view of what

23

it was a good idea to tell --

24

QUESTION:

25

What the highest court of any state might

do in reviewing jury instructions given in that state?

6

MR. MAYFIELD;

constitutional grounds because the rationale for that was they
said that if you tell a jury that someone else might change their
death penalty decision, that may lessen their sense of responsi­
bility for this awesome thing they are going to do in imposing
the death penalty.

7

And, I suggest that very rarely would a trial counsel
want to have that instruction given.

QUESTION:

Mr. Mayfield, may I

ask you a question?

The red brief has in it a table telling us how often the
California governors
there

have actually commuted death sentences, is

anything before us that tells us how often California

governors have commuted life sentences without possibility of
parole?
MR. MAYFIELD:

At page 4, I believe, of the Opposition

to the Petition for Certiorari, the counsel, I believe, set forth
a list over a period of some years — there have been 41 death
sentences commuted and 24 life without parole during that period.
QUESTION:

In what period was

MR. MAYFIELD:

that in?

I cannot tell you — I do not recall

the exact -QUESTION:

Twenty four over some several year period?

MR. MAYFIELD:

Yes, a period of quite a number of
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

years.
QUESTION:

2

In your view, would the defendant be entitled

3

to have the judge

4

had actually occurred only 24 times in the past 20 years or

5

whatever the figure is?

6

MR. MAYFIELD:

7

that to the jury that this possibility

I do not believe so, Your Honor, because

I do not think that tells very much.

QUESTION:

Well, but doesn't it tell more than Briggs

instruction tells?

10

MR. MAYFIELD:

It does, but I think perhaps expansion

11

would, in fact, invite speculation.

12

tion does is remove what is an otherwise misleading connotation

13

that the difference between these two sentences, death and life

14

without the possibility of parole, may appear to some to be

15

minimal --

16

QUESTION:

Now, one think this instruc­

But, Mr. Mayfield, supposing your 24

17

examples are 24 out of 24,000 -- I don't know how many sentences

18

this kind of put in effect — but if in 99 and 99/100 percent of

19

the cases, it is, in fact, life without the possibility of parole,

20

how misleading is it?

21

MR. MAYFIELD:

It would not be misleading, but the fact

22

remains that the possibility of commutation for life without

23

possibility of parole remains — it isn't — you didn't get

24

commuted now so you are all through.

25

now has that possibility.

Every one who is in prison

Well, I suppose, you might tell them about

the possibility of escape, then, too?

MR. MAYFIELD:

QUESTION:

MR. MAYFIELD:

6

I suggest that if California had chosen to eliminate

Well —

I mean it is equally frequent, isn't it?
I think not, Your Honor.

7

the sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole,

8

and tell the jury to select between 25 years to life and death,

9

that the jury would know that the defendant at some time could be

10

released from prison.

11

to inform the jury that the death penalty could be commuted,and

12

I believe that California's decision that it may make for a more

13

reliable and consistent decisions to inform the jury of the —

14

accurately of the meaning of this sentence does not violate any

15

guaranteed right of the defendant or does not make the decision

16

fundamentally unfair to him or otherwise arbitrary and capricious.

QUESTION:

MR. MAYFIELD:

I do not know the exact number.

about 30.

I cannot say where the Justice got

that figure, but my survey indicates about 30 may be affected.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EZRA HENDON, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9

MR. HENDON:

Mr. Hendon.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves a unique provision — there is no

10

other statute like it in the country — containing a provision

11

which has been universally condemned in virtually every state

12

jurisdiction that has been called upon to pass on it, and which —

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. HENDON:

I misunderstood your first statement.
Well, there is no other statute like it.

15

The issue of whether commutation can go to a jury in the absence

16

of a statute has been resolved in somewhere around 28 state court

17

jurisdictions.

18

that the issue of commutation in any form cannot go to a jury in

19

the penalty phase of --

Twenty-four of those 28 state courts have ruled

MR. HENDON:

MR. HENDON:

Well, that may be true, but on state grounds
No, I think —
Is this supervisory or federal grounds?
Well, many of them are cases which precede

25

recent ones which have been cited in the briefs, and there are

are two that have come down — another one out of Illinois called

3

People v. Zabo, which was decided on January 24, 1983 and another

out of Maryland called Poole v. Maryland, which was decided on

5

January 7, 1983.

In addition to those cited in the briefs, there

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. HENDON:

Are all 26 of those cases capital cases?
No, they are not.

However, I personally

8

think if a jury in a noncapital case — a jury which has a sen­

9

tencing function in a noncapital case — cannot hear about com­

10

mutation then a fortiori cannot hear about it in the capital.

11
12

QUESTION:

Does it make a difference where the trial is

bifurcated?

13

MR. HENDON:

Well, only to the extent that it may be

14

more prejudicial for a jury in a unitary proceeding to hear about

15

it.

16

I think theoretically and conceptually it should make no difference.

17

Conceptually, I think that is just a management problem.

QUESTION:

Mr. Hendon, you said that there were some

18

twenty-odd state cases involving instructions like this, were they

19

perfect counterparts to the California instruction?

20

have the first sentence as it is?

21

MR. HENDON:

Did they

Yes, they are even more fair than the

22

California instruction because our contention is that the

23

California instruction in its present form is misleading because

24

it involves partial disclosure —

25

QUESTION:

Do you think the first part of the first
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

sentence is misleading?

2

MR. HENDON:

Yes, Your Honor, I do because I do not

3

frankly read it the same way you do.

4

you are instructed that under the state constitution a governor

5

is empowered to grant a reprieve, pardon, or commutation of a

6

sentence following conviction of a crime.

7

sentence.

8
9

The way I read it, it says

It does not say any

It does not say all sentences.
QUESTION:

But certainly the use of the article, a, is

a very indefinite article.

10

MR. HENDON:

A is — my grammar is not what it should

11

be -- but I think it is a definite — I think it is a particular

12

sentence.

13

it is saying all sentences.

14

not the same, logically or grammatically.

15

It does not — there is at least ambiguity in whether

QUESTION:

A sentence and all sentences are

What is the federal — what is the reasoning

16

of the state courts who have held — how many did you say there

17

were — who have held this invalid on federal constitutional

18

grounds?

19

MR. HENDON:

I think if you examine the reasoning

20

behind the state court decisions, they go off on grounds which

21

are ultimately federal constitutional grounds, though they may

22

have preceeded Furman so that they are not couched in con­

23

stitutional terms, but the logic and the reasoning is that the

24

issue of commutation, even when the issue of commutation is put

25

before the jury — even when a jury is told that governor can

Of the recent ones —
Of all of them.

You said there were 28.

I can think of three off-hand.

The most

I believe Poole v. Maryland is federal

I think the Louisiana case, Lindsey, is.

There are two reasons why this provision, I think -this particular provision --

cannot pass constitutional muster.

First, it affirmatively misleads a jury in the penalty phase of
a capital case as to the nature of its function and the consequences
of its decision. And, secondly, as I have alluded to, it injects
a level of speculation and uncertainty into the penalty decision,
which cannot be tolerated in the capital case and which deflects
the jury from its true task.
What does this statute do?
you have two choices here.

It tells a jury, in effect,

You can sentence to life without

parole, or you can sentence to death.

But you should bear in

19

mind that life without parole does not mean life without parole,
that the governor can commute life without parole.

And, I may say in passing in response to the question
that Justice Rehnquist asked that the term life without parole
is no more a term of art in the state of California than is the
term death.

tell the jury, look, you may speculate about issues such as parole
or commutation, and I, the judge, will tell you about parole and
commutation so that you will know what the truth is, and so that
you will not speculate.

Because in that event, which is a question

This Court's opinions over and over and over again,
and California opinions over and over and over again, have made
clear that the power of the governor to commute is virtually
unlimited.

He can do so for any reason he sees fit at almost

any time that he sees fit.
And, in point of fact, as the chart which Justice
Stevens alluded to makes clear, California governors have
exercised that power as they saw fit, in terms of their political

20

view, their political perspective of what is an appropriate case

21

to commute taking into consideration all of the political,

22

essentially nonjudicial factors that go into a decision to pardon

23

or to commute.

24
25

And, to ask a jury to somehow factor that in to the
penalty phase of the capital case is to ask it to do the

But the

Did that just go to the -- what did it go

to?
MR. HENDON:

It went to the penalty phase -- strictly

to penalty, yes.
The California Supreme Court purported to predicate

17

its decision on the federal constitution, and, therefore, it did

18

not address the question of whether this error standing by itself

19

should mandate reversal of the penalty phase.

20

like that I suggested in the brief that this Court cannot feel

21

secure that the Petitioner has met his burden of demonstrating

22

not only that the court predicated its decision -- that the

California Supreme Court predicated its decision on a federal

In a situation

Suppose we agreed with you.

What would

you suggest?

MR. HENDON:

Well, the two options that this Court's

3

cases have followed in that situation is either to dismiss the

4

Writ as having been improvidently granted, or to vacate the

5

opinion of the California Supreme Court and remand for a

6

determination of whether the violation of California evidence law,

7

standing by itself would — and apart from any consideration,

8

federal constitutional considerations — would require reversal

of the penalty.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything further,

Mr. Mayfield?

MR. MAYFIELD:

13

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HARLEY D. MAYFIELD, ESQ.

14

Yes, Your Honor.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15

MR. MAYFIELD:

In regard to the jurisdctional question

16

of the issue that the California Supreme Court found prejudicial

17

evidence, it was bound up in the constitutional issue they were

18

addressing.

19

defendant's psychiatrist's testimony that the defendant himself

20

knew about the possibility of parole and was considering whether

21

he might want to take revenge if he were paroled.

22

Prejudicial evidence they found admitted included the

In regard to amplifying instructions, the California

23

Supreme Court did not find and the statute does not provide that

24

a defendant, if he chose to do so, could not request additional

25

amplifying instructions whether they related to a disclaimer
37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

telling the jury not to consider the other instruction or an

2

additional instruction about commutation of the death penalty.

3

The citation to Gardner v. Florida, that case is sort

4

of the obverse of this case.

5

the sentencer, the judge, had some information that the defendant

6

and his counsel did not have, and may have based his decision on

7

that.

That involved the instance where

Well, that was unfair.

8

In this case, the information that the jury was given

9

is information which the defendant knows, his counsel knows, and

10

we are asked to find that is unfair for the jury to know.
In regard to a necessity for some prophylactic measure to

11
12

offset this instruction to the jury informing them that there is,

13

in fact, a possibility of parole, I suggest that we have it in the

14

declarements of the statute itself, which sets forth specific

15

factors for the jury to consider and permits them to return a death

16

penalty only if they find aggravating factors outweigh mitigating

17

factors.

18

And,

I suggest that this instruction is not about com­

19

mutation anyway.

20

that this sentence, which is described as life imprisonment withouij:

21

the possibility of parole, if which by its description has parole in i t ,

22

that this sentence is, in fact, not a sentence that has no possibili by

23

of parole.

What it is a bout is about the indisputable fact

That is what the subject of the instruction is.
What you want to say is that the sentence is not tr ue

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. MAYFIELD:

That is correct as it —

QUESTION:

Well, is a statute that is not true a valid

statute?
MR. MAYFIELD:

I am not saying that the sentence is

4

I am saying that there is a possibility of parole, and I am

5

saying, yes, the statute is valid and particularly if jurors are

6

made aware of the fact of what this alternative sentence is.

7

The jurors are not told to speculate as to when the

8

defendant might be paroled.

9

consider these factors and determine whether aggravating cir­

10

They are specifically told to

cumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances.
QUESTION:

May I go back to the jurisdictional point

12

for a moment?

13

remember, was the psychiatrist's testimony that this defendant

14

had said that if his sentence is commuted, he might seek revenge

15

against the prosecutor, the judge, and the jury?

16

he said, something like that?

The testimony that was erroneously admitted, as I

17

MR. MAYFIELD:

18

QUESTION:

Was that what

Yes, Your Honor.

Now, and your view is, even though that is

19

a matter of state law -- an error of state law -- it would

20

presumably be harmless error, is that your thought? Why wouldn't

21

that be a sufficient reason for reversing the conviction?

22

MR. MAYFIELD:

What I am saying is that the reason

23

it was found to be erroneous — the California Supreme Court

24

said it was this instruction —

25

QUESTION:

Because the instruction emphasized the

fact that the sentence might be commuted?
MR. MAYFIELD:

Since this instruction permitted this

evidence to be introduced, it found that the mere mention —
QUESTION:

Well, but I am not quite clear on what your

5

response is.

The jurisdictional argument that your opponent makes

6

is that well, this is clearly an error of state law.

7

California Supreme Court has told us that.

8

obviously a fairly significant error because it suggests to the

9

jury that they ought to sentence the man to death in order to

The

And, it is rather

10

protect themselves, and, therefore, the judgment would have been

11

reversed on state law grounds even if they are wrong about the

12

federal constitution.

13
14
15

And, if that is true, then we do not have jurisdiction.
Now, what is your response to the argument?
MR. MAYFIELD:

My response to that is that the error

16

they found on state law grounds was error because of the con­

17

clusion that the instruction regarding the possibility of parole

18

was erroneous on federal constitutional grounds.

19

QUESTION:

Well, that may be true, but it is still

20

ultimately a state law ground as to the erroneously admitted

21

evidence, isn't it?

22

MR. MAYFIELD:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. MAYFIELD:

25

No, Your Honor, it is not.

Oh, I see —
Because it is — the only reason —

the reason it was erroneously admitted was because of the
40

ruling on the federal constitutional error.

3

QUESTION:

You are not suggesting that it would have

been harmless error?

4

Let me just be sure I get that to one side?

MR. MAYFIELD:

I am suggesting that on state law — if

5

it is strictly state law grounds — then under the state law

6

the California Supreme Court would have to examine the evidence

7

and determine that a miscarriage of justice occurred.

8
9

QUESTION:

If this were remanded as your colleague

suggests, or if we ruled that there is an adequate independent

10

state ground, I take it that would be on the basis there was

11

going to be a new trial.

12

go forward without this instruction, since the state Supreme

13

Court has ruled that the instruction is unconstitutional.

14

MR. MAYFIELD:

15

QUESTION:

16

Yes —

And, if the new trial went forward and the

state lost, the federal issue would be foreclosed, I suppose.

17
18

And, I suppose the new trial would

MR. MAYFIELD:

That is correct.

If there were a new

trial in all cases, the California Supreme Court's ruling --

19

QUESTION:

You say that without the federal con­

20

stitutional ruling which you say is erroneous, the state would

21

never — the state court would never have made this evidentiary

22

rule.

23

MR. MAYFIELD:

I do not go that far.

I say that the

24

evidentiary ruling — the finding of prejudice is so bound up in

25

the federal constitutional ruling that we cannot say that there
