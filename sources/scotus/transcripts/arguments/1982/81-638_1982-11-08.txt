ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEROY S. ZIMMERMAN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7
8

MR. ZIMMERMAN;

This case involves the issue of whether

10

regulations promulgated by Pennsylvania’s prison

11

authorities create the expectation of a liberty interest

12

in prisoners, requiring due process before a prisoner

13

can be transferred from general population to

14

administrative segregation pending the completion of an

15

investigation into a riot at the state prison in

16

Huntington, Pennsylvania.

On December 8, 1978, he was given a hearing,

confined to disciplinary segregation for a period of six
months.
The sources of a liberty interest are our
Fourteenth Amendment, which protects life, liberty and
property, and in this particular case we focus on
liberty.

The cases of Meachum and Montanye support our

Pennsylvania position that administrative custody is
within the normal range of a lawful conviction and
sentence.

The residue of liberty in the inmate after a

lawful conviction and a lawful sentence does not include
any right to remain in the general population of the
prison.

The fact that changes are adverse to an inmate

does not give that inmate a right to due process.
A liberty interest can be created by statute
or by regulation.
particular case.

He focus on regulation in this
To create that liberty interest, there

must be a clear and explicit and direct mutual
expectation that a liberty interest is to be created,
and the state must be bound to do or to refrain from
doing something that can be determined by objective
standards.
Prison authorities must have the latitude to
exercise discretion in carrying out their duties and
responsibilities inside these prisons.

QUESTIONS

General Zimmerman, would you tell

us what section of the Pennsylvania Code, or sections,
you believe governed the proceedings in this instance
against the prisoner?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Your Honor, the relevant

sections, we believe, are first Section 107 — 107
appears at page 45 of our brief.

107 is a general

policy statement of when to use administrative custody.
In order that the prisons remain safe, the officials
must have the discretion and the latitude to segregate
inmates in order to maintain that security and safety.
There are times, and the list is contained in 95.107,
where an individual who poses a threat to other inmates
must be segregate!, or a threat to staff, or to himself,
or he poses an escape risk, or he needs protection
himself from other inmates.
Now, I think that 107 is the first section
that’s relevant here in our inquiry.

Eut then, of

course, it's necessary to go to Section 95.104(b)(3),
which is page 43 of our brief.

And that too represents

a policy statement for when to use administrative
custody, for investigations.
this particular case.

And that was the focus in

There was an investigation under

way.
The court said that prison society is

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

different from society at large —
QUESTIONS

Mr. Attorney General, while we're

speaking of regulations, your brief doesn't cite Hughes
Hughes against Rowe, a case that is made a good bit out
of by the opposing briefs.

Do you feel that the

Illinois regulations at issue in Hughes against Rowe
were in any respect very different from the Pennsylvania
regulations at issue here?
MR. ZIMMERMAN*

Your Honor, in Hughes v. Rowe,

in reading the case the key unclear point was the effect
of administrative segregation in those regulations in
that case.

One opinion noted that the administrative

segregation appeared to result in a loss of good time,
which certainly we would then concede puts it within
Wolff.
However, if the record does not reflect any
serious security problem or if that administrative
segregation — and this is Hughes, in my opinion —
administrative segregation was for investigative
purposes, we feel that it’s in that sense similar to our
case.
QUESTION;

General Zimmerman, when was the

first date the Respondent was given a hearing?
MR. ZIMMERMAN;

Your Honor, the Respondent was

given a notice of his charge on December 4,

1978, the

next day, and a hearing on December 8, 1978, within six

2

days.

3
4

QUESTION*

At that hearing did he have an

opportunity to speak for himself?

5

MR. ZIMMERMAN*

Our regulations in

6

Pennsylvania provide that an inmate has the opportunity

7

to be present, to call witnesses on his behalf, and to

8

speak.

He did speak.

9
10

QUESTION*

Mas he advised of the opportunity

to call witnesses on his behalf?
MR. ZIMMERMAN*

11

The record does not — yes, he

12

was.

13

that hearing and he had the opportunity to speak, sir.

As a matter of fact, he had a witness present at

15

QUESTION:

And on January 2nd, did he have the

same opportunity?

16

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

January 2nd is a hearing

conducted by the program review committee.

18

hearing he had the same opportunity to speak.

19

regulations provide that he had the opportunity to call

20

a witness, to have a witness present, to have that

21

witness speak on his behalf, and that a determination is

22

made.

QUESTION:

For how long?
From December 3rd, right after

the riot in the prison, until January 22nd, a total of
51 days.

Yes, Your Honor, he was in

QUESTION:

And the January 22nd is what, after

the final hearing he had?

13

ME. ZIMMERMAN:

January 22nd is the day that

14

he had a full-blown Wolff-type hearing, at which he had

15

the opportunity to speak, call witnesses, and be heard.

16

QUESTION:

Now, was he changed after January

17

22nd from administrative custody to disciplinary

18

custody?

19

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

At the conclusion, one of the

20

determinations, of course, at that January 22nd hearing

21

was that he was guilty of the second misconduct charge.

22

At that time it was determined that he should serve six

23

months in disciplinary custody.

24
25

QUESTION:

Is there any difference between

disciplinary and administrative custody in terms of what

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

the prisoner experiences?
HR. ZIMMERMAN*

Well, in Pennsylvania prisons,

Your Honor, the physical setup, disciplinary custody is
much the same as administrative custody and not at all
dissimilar to general population, either.
difference, of course, is the purpose.

The basic

Disciplinary is

punitive and administrative is that tool which we have
provided in Pennsylvania with these regulations.
QUESTION*

Well, in either case he’s treated

the same way, isn't he?
MR. ZIMMERMAN*

Yes, he is.

There is a basic

difference, and that goes to what the effect of that
custody is.

In disciplinary custody there is no

question that it affects his parole and it would affect
his pre-release status.
QUESTION*

In administrative custody —

How about good time?

MR. ZIMMERMAN*

Your Honor, we don't have good

time in Pennsylvania.
In administrative custody, there is no effect
on parole or on pre-release status.
QUESTION*

Mr. Attorney General, when you

spoke of the January 22nd hearing, did that relate to
the offense of assaulting an officer, allegedly, while
he was in administrative custody?
MR. ZIMMERMAN;

The January 22nd hearing dealt

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

with the two misconducts, in essence.

However, the

first misconduct that he was charged with generally on
December 4th was withdrawn without conclusion at the
January 22ni hearing, and the finding of that hearing
committee was on the second misconduct charge, where he
was confined to disciplinary for six months at that
hearing.
QUESTION:

The second one was assaulting one

of the guards, one of the officers?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Yes.

In both instances he was

accused of physically assaulting guards.

The guards

suffered serious injuries, and he was one, as I said, of
18 inmates that were segregated on the night of December
3rd, 1978, as a result of this prison riot.
QUESTION:

Could you explain, though, what's

the difference between the two charges?
for assaulting.

They're both

They were just different guards at the

same riot?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

They were different guards,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

At the same date?

MR. ZIMMERMAN:

The first date — the dates

are the same, December 3rd, 1978.

In the first

misconduct charge, at that time this whole riot was in
operation.

A charge was prepared and given to him the

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

next day, and there wasn't the specificity of the
particular guard at that time.

This investigation was

continuing and was under way.
The second misconduct charge was specific.
They assaulted Sergeant Phillips, a corrections
officer.

And that's the one he was ultimately

determined to be guilty of and confined on.
QUESTIONj

Is it reasonable to assume that it

really related to the same incident and the second one
was just merely more specific in identifying the
particular officer?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

The same incident, different

individuals, and more specificity in the second
misconduct.
QUESTIONs

So the first one related to a

different correctional officer?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

There's a reference to a

different corrections officer.
QUESTION i

I see.

MR. ZIMMERMANS
QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.

Have the Pennsylvania courts

interpreted the Section 95.104(b)(3)

to mean that

administrative custody may be maintained so long as
there has been no determination on the misconduct
charge?

QUESTION;

Mr. Attorney General, I'm sorry,

but I'd like to interrupt you, if I may, once more on
these two charges, because the Chief Justice's question
concerned me.

The second one, I'm just looking at it,

says misconduct date, January 1979.
MR. ZIMMERMAN*

The second charge. Justice

Stevens, was filed on January 19.
QUESTION*

I understand.

But the charge

itself says, misconduct date, 1/19/79.
MR. ZIMMERMAN*

The misconduct date was not

the 19th.
QUESTION*

That's what it says.

the record, of your appendix, joint appendix.

Whereas

the earlier one says, misconduct date, 12/3/78, which
was the date of the riot.

detention, and I guess that seems to be.

However, he was not charged —

I think it's the wording there.

He was not charged

until January with the second misconduct, the specific
one against Sergeant Phillips.
QUESTION*

Well, the earlier one uses the term

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

"misconduct date" to refer to the date of the riot.
Look at 37A.

Is it quite clear that this is the —

appendix at 37A, misconduct 90908/ he was give that
charge on December 4th, and the alleged misconduct —
QUESTION:

See, he was given the charge on the

4th and it refers to the misconduct date as the 3rd.
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

The 3rd was the date of the

incident, the riot, the day before.
QUESTION:

And that’s what made me think that

the later one, when it says misconduct date January 19,
probably meant what it said.
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

Page 30A of the joint

appendix, the misconduct date is stated, December 3rd,
1978, 90986.

And at 30A in the second paragraph,

Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

I see.

I’m sorry to interrupt.

Thank you for clearing it up, because it's just
confusing.
QUESTION:

Incidentally, Mr. Attorney General,

the formal criminal charges were dropped?
MR. ZIMMERMAN:

hearing —

The regulations here do not bind Pennsylvania
prison officials do no bind Pennsylvania prison
officials to do or to refrain from doing what can be
determined by objective standards.

Section

95.107(a)(1), which is at page 46 of our brief, that is
the general policy statement of when to use
administrative segregation and the purposes I mentioned
a few moments ago -- protection of the prison society by
segregating inmates who pose a threat, who may be an
escape risit.

All these factors are subjective and

require predictive judgments on the part of our prison
officials.
Also at issue, of course, is 95.104, which
I've argued — is at page 43 of our brief -- which I
said is a similar policy statement for using
administrative custody.

Because these factors are

subjective in nature, there is no liberty interest
created.
If this Court finds no liberty interest, then
it need go no further.

If the Court finds a liberty

interest, I urge the Court to reject the Third Circuit
Court's conclusion that the full range of procedures
prescribed in Wolff must be provided.
Hany of the same considerations which we

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

contend militate against a finding of a liberty interest
are also relevant to the issue of what process is due.
Specifically, the factors considered are subjective and
they are predictive as well.

The government has an

overriding concern for the security in the
institutions.

The consequences of administrative

custody are minimal.

Thus, all of these reasons dictate

against requiring the full range of trial-like
procedures required by the court below.
In this case, the prisoner got as much as the
Constitution requires, if indeed the Constitution
requires anything.
Thank you.
QUESTION*

Before you sit down, may I just

ask, is it your view that since there’s no liberty
interest at all and since administrative custody is
physically the same as disciplinary custody, that
without giving any hearing whatsoever an inmate could be
put in administrative custody for the entire period of
his confinement?
NR. ZIMMERMAN*

Yes, sir.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Fishman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. FISHMAN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. FISHMAN*

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

please the Court:
This case is Wolff versus McDonnell revisited
with a slightly different twist.

Whether the segregated

confinement in this case is legally or technically
administrative custody, these prison officials
considered it disciplinary in its nature from its
inception, based on a single triggering event, the
disturbance, and not based on the Respondent's general
background or record.
And I think some of the facts need to be
clarified for purpose of showing my point.

On December

3rd, that same evening, the Respondent, Mr. Helms, was
taken from his cell in the general prison population and
placed in a disciplinary cell in segregation under
investigation for suspected involvement in the
disturbance that evening.

He was charged with a

misconduct or disciplinary rule violation within 24
hours of his confinement on the 3rd.
Now, the December 8th,

1978, hearing committee

report, that’s the disciplinary tribunal.
dispute in this case.

It's in

It’s our position no hearing was

taken on that particular date, that his case was merely
continued due to insufficient information and pending
the results of a state police investigation.

That is

what the Court of Appeals remanded for, on that issue.

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

The Petitioners in this case, in response to
paragraph 19 of the complaint, stated that the first
hearing on the misconduct, the first adjudication or
factfinding, did not take place until January 22nd of
1979, or 51 days later.
Now, it*s important to note that on that
report of the hearing committee on December 8th it was
labeled at the top "misconduct report."
QUESTION.-

Mr. Fishman, what did the Court of

Appeals hold with respect to whether that first hearing
on December 8th had or had not taken place?
MR. FISHMAN:

They remanded it for a

determination factually as to whether or not that was a
hearing in respect to the procedures that Mr. Helms
asked for.
QUESTION:

So they didn’t — they made some

comment in their opinion, didn’t they, about the fact
that your client had signed some sort of a statement?
MR. FISHMAN:

Yes, there was some -- it had

been decided on summary judgment initially in the
district court and the court felt that there were some
contradictory statements, the answer to the complaint
that I just mentioned, the paragraph 19 stating that th
first adjudication was on the 22nd of January, and then
the statement that Mr. Helms signed on the 8th which

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

indicated the opposite, that he had a hearing on that
day.

That's what the remand was, to clarify that

discrepancy.
Moving on, the status review of January 2nd,
1979, by the program review committee, which you've
heard mentioned, said "continue Helms in disciplinary
custody,” even though he hadn't been convicted of
anything as of that date.

And even the Petitioners at

page 14 —
QUESTION;

You say convicted?

HR. FISHMAN;

Convicted.

Of a misconduct or a

disciplinary rule violation.

He hadn’t been found

guilty or responsible.
QUESTION;

Are you suggesting that the action

must be supported by a conviction?
MR. FISHMAN;
QUESTION;

No, but I'm trying to show —

Do you mean a finding?

MR. FISHMAN;

A finding.

At this point there

had been no finding one way or the other, but it said
"continue in disciplinary custody."
The point that I'm trying to make is that the
prison officials considered this disciplinary from its
inception, regardless of whether technically or legally
it was administrative custody.

And as I said in the

brief at page 14, they stated he was confined in

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

segregation because he was charged with a major
misconduct.
In addition, the Court of Appeals found that
the conditions of administrative custody were the
equivalent of punitive or disciplinary segregation.

And

the conditions that Mr. Helms experienced until he had
this hearing on the 22nd of January involved sensory
deprivation in its true sense.
cell almost 24 hours a day.

He was confined in a

The only time he got out

was between five and ten minutes a day for exercise,
three or four days a week.
If he attempted to as much as talk in a normal
tone, he was threatened with an institutional
misconduct.

In December and January, showers were

virtually nonexistent.
Studies have indicated, as I tried to show in
my brief, that this kind of confinement can and often
does lead to adverse mental effects upon the inmate.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn’t any kind of

confinement have some psychological reaction?
MR. FISHMAN:

Yes, but I think in this case

it’s a question of degree, and I don’t think that the
confinement involved here that I've described is what
naturally inures as part of a Pennsylvania sentence.
And I believe that the potential of this kind of

confinement is one of the reasons that Pennsylvania
evolved from the 1700's and 1800's in Quaker thought of
segregated or solitary confinement to the congregate or
general population idea that we have today.
QUESTION;

Are the only differences in the

administrative custody and the disciplinary custody the
effect on parole status and pre-release time?
MR. FISHMAN;

No.

We believe that the

collateral consequences are the same.

Under

Pennsylvania law —
QUESTION;

You assert that administrative

custody does affect the parole release?
MR. FISHMAN;

Yes.

Even the Petitioners in

their briefs said or conceded that it may result in a
delay in a parole hearing or delay of release on
parole.

Pennsylvania law and policy, Justice O'Connor,

requires that his status be reported to the parole
board, the conduct involved.
QUESTION:

Do the conditions of administrative

confinement differ from the conditions of disciplinary
confinement?
MR. FISHMAN;

I would say yes.

They're worse,

because it*s indefinite in length.
QUESTION;

Well, is that the only difference?

I mean, you've just been telling us that in disciplinary

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

confinement the prisoner may not even speak, in a normal
tone of voice.

Is that true if he were in

administrative confinement?
ME. FISHMAN*

Well, yes.

Here that's what

happened.
QUESTION*

And if he's in administrative

confinement, he has only ten minutes a day for
exercise?
MR. FISHMAN:
QUESTION*

And no showers available?

MR. FISHMAN:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Virtually none, correct.

So there's just no difference in

that as to confinement?
MR. FISHMAN:
QUESTION*

Yes.

Whether administrative or

disciplinary, it's the same thing, is that it?
MR. FISHMAN*
QUESTION;

Yes.

Well, while they're investigating a

serious disruption — well, a riot -- would it be proper
to have disciplinary — not disciplinary, administrative
segregation of people charged?
MR. FISHMAN:
QUESTION*

Yes.

I'd like to --

You have no question about that, do

you?
MR. FISHMAN*

No.

But in this case I do.

1

First of all, there's been discussion about the

2

regulation 95.104(b)(3).

I believe Justice O'Connor

3

brought that up earlier.

That regulation provides in

4

all cases the inmate must be released within ten days.

5

In addition —

6

QUESTION;

Is there a qualifier there, that if

7

no behavior violation has occurred he is to be

8

released?

9

MR. FISHMAN;

No, I believe the "but in all

10

cases" is afterwards, so that it would not be

11

conditioned on a behavior —

12

QUESTION;

So it's your position that "if no

13

behavior violation has occurred" is not a predicate to

14

the release within ten days provision?

15

MR. FISHMAN;

16

QUESTION;

17
18

Yes.

There is no Pennsylvania case so

holding?
MR. FISHMAN;

Well, there is a Pennsylvania

19

case, Hoss versus Cuyler, which I cited in ray brief,

20

which interprets the same regulation as stating that it

21

creates a liberty interest in the freedom from the, and

22

the words are, "harsh conditions of administrative

23

custody" in Pennsylvania.

24

And one of the points I'd like to make is,

25

regardless of how one looks at the wording itself of

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

these regulations, these regulations same out of a
federal court consent decree called I.C.D. versus
Shapp.

The state voluntarily entered a consent decree.

The regulations were issued as a result of it.

So if

the standard for creating a liberty interest is the
mutual expectation, it's definitely present in this
case .
QUESTIONS

Mr. Fishman, what was the issue in

the case that led to the consent degree?
MR. FISHMAN;
suit.

That was a general conditions

There were many issues in that case, from

disciplinary confinement to access to law libraries and
so forth.
QUESTION;

Mr. Fishman —

MR. FISHMAN:
QUESTION;

Yes.

— did the Respondent serve the

entire six months to which he was sentenced on January
22nd?
MR. FISHMAN:

Yes, he was, because the Court

of Appeals decision throwing out the misconduct
conviction did not take place until much afterwards.
QUESTION;

And was his parole deferred as a

result of that?
MR. FISHMAN;
that.

Well, the record is unclear on

He did serve more than his minimum release date,

12

QUESTION:

Would you clarify again how

administrative custody affects parole or pre-release?

14

don't think I understood your statement.

15

MR. FISHMAN;

I

Well, the Pennsylvania statutes,

16

as well as the policies of the Board of Probation and

17

Parole in Pennsylvania, require that the conduct of the

18

individual be reported by prison officials as well as

19

investigated by the parole board.
In addition, program involvement or lack of

QUESTIONS

It has an indirect effect.

MR. FISHMANs

Yes, yes, an indirect effect.

Now, the Court of Appeals also found in this
case that the institution returned to normal within a
day of the disturbance of December 3rd.

And I've

already mentioned about the 104(b)(3), that regulation
holding someone in investigative status.

There was

another regulation, Administrative Directive 004, which
required the results of the state police investigation
to be communicated to the superintendent of the
institution prior to the criminal charges being filed.
Here they were filed on December 11th and, as
we heard earlier, they were dismissed.

Yet still Helms

did not have his hearing until the 22nd of January.
In addition. Lieutenant Kyler, who was the
charging officer and who had submitted two affidavits in
this case, the second one appearing at page 82 of the
joint appendix, indicated that he was informed to go
ahead regardless of the status of the criminal case, to
go ahead with the institutional disciplinary charges.
So my point being that the delay here I do not think was
justified.
Also, in terms of the question of burden, the
second set of admissions in this case indicates that

14

even of an emergency should not be saddled with

disciplinary procedures or procedural due process.

16

I think has become lost in that argument is that we're

Is it

both as severe as those for a disciplinary confinement

and also significantly different from one in the general

22

population?

23

the Government’s brief, they say in the federal system

24

to which you just referred the administrative

25

confinement is very much like the general population.

The reason I ask that is, as I understand

it's disciplinary custody also because of the

But as I

understand it, you also argue that, even if they changed

13

all the labels and made everything administrative and

14

gave you no hearings at all — and your opponent, of

15

course, says they could do that.

16

largely, as I understand it — would also be based on

17

the fact that there's a significant physical difference

18

in the character of the custody.

19

MR. FISHMAN;

Yes.

I would say that the

custody here is so severe that it cannot in any way be

considered part of the normal Pennsylvania sentence that

one expects.
