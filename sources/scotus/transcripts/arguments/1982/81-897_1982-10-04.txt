ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. WILKINS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

9

MR. WILKINSs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court,

10
11

Thank you.

the issue in this case is whether a worker injured upon

12 actual navigable waters who

would have been covered by

t

13 the Longshoremen's Act prior to its amendment in 1972
14 retains that coverage, or whether Congress by amending
15 the Act in 1972 restricted coverage for this class of
16 amphibious worker.
17

Respondent Raymond Churchill was injured in

18 1974 while standing aboard a crane barge engaged in
19 unloading a caisson from a supply vessel during the
20 construction of the North River Pollution Control
21 Project, which is a sewage treatment plant that extends
22 over the Hudson River in New York City.

He filed a

23 claim for compensation under the Act, and after a
24 hearing, the Administrative Law Judge denied that claim,
25 concluding that he was not engaged in maritime

1

employment.
The Benefits Review Board by a divided vote

2

3 subsequently sustained the conclusion of the
4 Administrative Law Judge, and the Second Circuit denied
.5 Churchill’s petition for review, concluding that his
6

employment was not maritime as it lacked a significant

7 relationship to navigation or to commerce on navigable
8 waters.

9

There can be little iispute but that prior to

10

1972, Respondent Churchill could have claimed coverage

11

under the Act.

12

work-related injuries occurring on actual navigable

•13

waters.

14

Prior to that date, the Act covered all

QUESTIONS

Mr. Churchill did not petition for

15 cert, did he?
16

MR. WILKINS;

17

QUESTION ;

18

MR. WILKINS;

No, he did not.

Do you know why?
I am uncertain as to the actual

19 circumstances for that failure.

He did file a brief

20 supporting the director's petition,
21

QUESTION;

however.

Yes, I know, but he — if there is

22 jurisdiction here, it has to be because you petitioned.

23

MR. WILKINS;

24

QUESTION;

Yes.

But it would have been so simple for

25 — Is there any barrier to his petitioning for cert?

MB. WILKINSi

1

Not that I am aware of. Justice

2 Blackmun.

3

Coverage prior to 1972 did stop at the water's

4 edge, so Congress in 1972 amended the Act in part to
5 eliminate the Incongruities of this coverage rule by
6 extending the coverage of the Act ashore for the first

7 time to certain areas contiguous to the water's edge.
8 The Act as amended also contained a second coverage

9 requirement.
10 covered

Not only must the injury occur on a

situs, but the employee must meet a status

11

test.

Section 2(3) of the Act defines a covered

12

employee as any person engaged in maritime employment.
The proper application of this maritime

13

14 employment status test to a traditionally covered
15 amphibious worker is the question currently before the
16 Court.

Proper consideration and analysis of this

17 question requires careful attention to three important
18 factors.

First, the term "maritime employment" itself

19 has traditionally been construed as including all work
20 actually taking place on navigable waters.
21

Second, it

is very clear from the legislative history of the 1972

22 amendments that Congress intended to retain this

23 traditional coverage for longshore -- for maritime
24 workers and amphibious workers injured on actual
25 navigable waters.

2

MR. WILKINS;

Me. Wilkins, could I go back for

a moment to the point raised by Justice Blackmun?

Is it

3 the government's position that although the propriety of
4 the director's appealing to the Court of Appeals may be
5 very much open to doubt in a case like this, it is the
6

propriety of the director's petition for certiorari to

7 review a Court of Appeals judgment is perfectly clear?
8

MR. WILKINS;

9

QUESTION;

10

Doesn't that strike you as rather

strange?
MR. WILKINS;

11
12

Yes, Justice Rehnguist.

No.

There is no Court of Appeals

that questions the propriety of the director's

13 participation in a petition for review as a respondent.
14 The Second Circuit does not question that, and indeed we
15 participated as a party respondent in this case.

Once

16 we are a proper party in the Court of Appeals, the
17 certiorari statute, 2812.54, states that any party may
18 apply for a writ of certiorari.

So, we are clearly as a

19 party respondent entitled.
QUESTION;

20
21

You say it might be different if you

had been the — yourself seeking review in the Court of

22 Appeals rather than supporting the judgment of the

23 board.
24

MR. WILKINS;

There is currently something of a

25 conflict among the circuits.

At least three circuits

grant the director standing to seek a petition for

2

review.

Two circuits that I am aware of have raised a

3 question regarding this.

This question, though, is not

4 presented in this case, as we were and we concededly
5 were a proper party below.
6

The third important —

QUESTION*

8

HR. WILKINS*

What did you lose?
There is an important coverage

9 question at issue here.
10

QUESTION*

What did you lose?

11

MR. WILKINS*

12

QUESTION*

13

HR. WILKINS*

We --

How much did you lose?
:

We didn't lose any monetary

14 amount, if that is the question.
15

QUESTION*

Well, what did you lose, prestige?

16

MR. WILKINS*

No, we lost the ability to

17 effectively administer and interpret — to fulfill our
18 administrative responsibilities under the Act.
19

QUESTION:

Mr. Wilkins —

20

MR. WILKINS*

21

QUESTION*

Yes.

— your argument about standing

22 doesn't really address itself, though, to the Article 3

23 standing question for constitutional purposes, does it?
24

MR. WILKINS*

To the exten that we — we argue

25 that we have administrative interests in interpreting

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the Act.

That is historically in many cases from —

2 that are cited in our reply brief have found that an

3 administrative interest that has been impaired by a
4 decision below is sufficient to give a governmental
5 entity injury.
6

QUESTION*

But as I understand your

7 administrative argument, it is to the effect that you
8 have to give advice to employees, and you would be
9 better able to do that if you could get an answer to
10

these questions, and is that really not in the nature of

11

asking an advisory opinion?

12

HR. WILKINS:

Not really. Justice O’Connor.

13 also have other administrative responsibilities.

We

For

14 example, under Section 932 of the Act, we have to
15 enforce the insurance requirements of the Act.

We have

16 to bring actions against employers who do not comply
17 with the insurance requirements.

Under the Second

18 Circuit’s decision, an entire range of employers, marine
19 construction employers, for example, do not have to
20 comply with that Act, yet under the decisions of the
21

Fifth Circuit, for example, we have a responsibility to

22 enforce 932 against these employers.

So, the decision

23 below does really impose differing enforcement
24 responsibilities and different — of a very severe and
25 important nature.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

QUESTION*

1

Well, certainly a lot of government

2 agencies can come here without showing out of pocket
3 loss.
4

The Labor Board, the Federal — you know, just

all —
MR. WILKINS*

5

6 In Re Debs opinion,
7

Exactly.

As far ago as the old

this Court stated that the mere fact

that the government cannot show monetary loss is

8 insufficient to estop the government standing in federal
9

court.

10

The third important consideration beyond the

11

fact that the term "maritime employment" historically

12 includes work on the water and

Congressional intent, is

13 the fact that the navigation or commerce test utilized
14 below leads to a logical result, and has clearly been
15 shown to be impracticable and unworkable as a means of
16 delineating coverage under the Act.
17

Respondent Perini North River Associates would

18 argue that

the term "maritime employment" reaches only

19 those activities that possess some substantial

20 connection to commercial shipping or navigation.

The

21 term, however, has never been so strictly limited.
22 plain meaning,

The

indeed, of the term "maritime employment"

23 clearly reaches those occupations that are regularly
24 performed on actual navigable waters.

Although there is virtually no explicit —

QUESTION*

1

2 Wilkins?

May I stop you right there, Mr.

It is generally assumed that the Act would

3

apply — anything over maritime, over navigable waters.

4

If this were a pier extending out into the water, work

5

on the pier would not have been covered.
MB. WILKINSs

6

Prior to 1972, no, because the

7

pier would have been considered land because it was

8

permanently attached to land.
QUESTION*

9

Why wouldn’t a sewage treatment

10 plant be like a pier?

MR. WILKINS*

11

The sewage treatment plant itself

12 might have been like a pier.
13

Mr. Churchill, however,

was standing on a barge floating on actual navigable

14 waters,

a barge that had four motors to navigate itself

15

upon the water.

Ke clearly would have been covered

16

before the Act.

He was not on an extension of land.

17

QUESTION*

18

MR. WILKINS*

19 no

I see.
Although there has virtually been

— although there is no explicit discussion of the

20 maritime employment requirement, or virtually none,

21

prior to '72, the reported cases of this and other

22 federal courts make it very clear that employment on the
23 water was considered maritime.

Indeed, all of the cases

24 that were decided under the old maritime local doctrine
25 proceed on the assumption

that employment on the water

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is by itself maritime, although in particular cases it

2 can be local.

3

Indeed, Professors Gilmore and Black state that

4 workers who are not seamen but who nevertheless suffer
5 injury on navigable waters, are no doubt engaged in
6 maritime employment.

Notwithstanding this historic

7 construction -8

MB. WILKINS*

9 that last quotation.

Mr. Wilkins, let me go back to
Would that mean that a delivery

10 man delivering something
11

12

to Mr. Churchill on his barge

would be covered?
MR. WILKINSs

If he had to go aboard the barge

13 to end the delivery, and he was required to do that in
14 the course of his employment, under pre-1972 law and
15 under the historic construction of the term, while he
16 was on the barge, yes, he would have been covered.
17

QUESTION*

So if he were bringing a pizza out

18 to Mr. Churchill 'for lunch, he would be covered?
19

MR. WILKINS*

If he was required to deliver

20 that pizza in the course of his employment and go upon
21

the actual navigable waters in the course of his

22 employment, yes.

23

QUESTION*

Mr. Wilkins, if you win, does

24 Churchill get the money?
25

MR. WILKINS*

Yes, he will, Your Honor.

MR. WILKINS*

5

You mean the attorney is going to

6 get paid, too, for not doing anything but sitting still?

He did even

Yes, Your Honor.

Where a party that is not an actual

party to the litigation is going to collect?
MR. WILKINS*

16

The Court has indeed granted, for

17

example, in the Walter Tanson case, cited in our reply

18

brief, we filed a petition for certiorari without the

19

claimant, and the Court granted our petition and

20 reversed.
21

QUESTION*

It is strange, isn't it?

22

MR. WILKINS*

Well, I don't think it is strange

23

when you consider that we have very important

24

enforcement responsibilities that go beyond perhaps the

25

individual interests.

17

Respondent Churchill is
The case is

He will receive his benefits.
Notwithstanding the historic construction of

18

the term "maritime employment" as including all

19

employment on actual navigable waters. Respondents

20 Perini contend that Congress restricted the coverage of
21

the Act in 1972 by adding’a maritime employment

22 requirement.

The legislative history of the 1972 Act is

23

not extensive.

However, the clear import of that

24

legislative history is that Congress intended to extend

25

the coverage of the Act to cover additional workers.

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Congress was concerned about the incongruity of

2

workers crossing over the Jensen line from navigable

3

waters to dry land and thereby walking in and out of

4

coverage .

5

QUESTIONS

Mr. Wilkins, in this very case, if

6 this employee worked sometimes on the barge and
7

sometimes on the partially completed structure, would he

8 be walking in and out of coverage under your view of the

9 Act?
MR. WILKINS*

10

Under our view of the Act, no.

11

Indeed, the purpose of Congress in amending the Act in

12

1972 was to extend the coverage of Mr. Churchill ashore.
QUESTION;

13

14 partially completed
15 engaged

Well, if he had been working on the
structure, he would not have been

in maritime employment.
MR. WILKINS;

QUESTION;

18

Well, take another employee with

19 slightly different duties.

Say he worked on the

20 partially completed structure 60 percent of the time,
21

but then had to go on the barge part of the time.

Would

22 that employee walk in and out of coverage?

MR. WILKINS;

23

In that circumstance, no, because

24 he still performs substantial duties of a maritime
25

nature.

intended to restrict this problem of walking in and out

QUESTION*

But your argument — I want to be

24 sure I understand it, because a big part of your

we are talking about people who were

clearly covered before the '72 amendment.

Now, if we

3 partially completed structure, he would not have been
4 clearly covered prior to the 1972 amendments for 80
5 percent of his time.
6

MR. WILKINS*

No.

Prior to 1972, he would have walked

8 in and out of coverage.

Now, why doesn't he walk in and

9 out of coverage now, again?

Because Congress intended to

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

covering those activities on shore, they recognized that

2 they were opening up the possibility that many
3

land-based, totally land-based workers could claim for

the first time coverage under the Act.

5

QUESTIONS

Hell, you don't need to win on this

6 to win this case.
7

HR. WILKINS*

8

QUESTION*

9
10

No.

This is just —

You don’t have to decide that the

worker on the sewage plant would be covered.
MR. WILKINS*

Exactly.

We only need to argue

11

— we only need to win that Mr. Churchill, because he

12

was on actual navigable waters, is covered.

13

QUESTION*

No, but your third argument is not

14

valid unless you win that other case.

15

argument is, we get away from the walking in and out of

16

coverage problem by adopting your construction.

17
18

MR. WILKINS*

Your third

We alleviate to some extent the

walking in and out of coverage problem.

19

QUESTION*

Oh, okay.

20

QUESTION*

Incidentally, Mr. Wilkins, does the

21

legislative history have any references to Davis and

22 Calbeck and those cases?
23

MR. WILKINS*

It does not. Your Honor, and I

24

hope to address those opinions very shortly, because

25

they are crucial to our position in this case.

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Congress enacted the maritime employment

1

2 requirement solely to limit the availability of the
3

Longshoremen's Act to totally land-based workers who

4

previously to 1972 had to rely solely upon state

5

compensation acts.

It did not intend to restrict

6 coverage of amphibious workers.
7

Indeed/ the Senate

reports state this conclusion forcefully.

Amended

8 Section 2(3) specifically includes any longshoreman or
9 other person engaged in longshoring operations.
10

It does

not exclude employees traditionally covered.
The navigation or commerce test utilized below

11
12

not only ignores the traditional content of the term

13

"maritime employment" and the express Congressional

14

intent behind the '72 amendments, but it leads to

15

illogical results and has been shown by this Court to be

16

impracticable and unworkable as a means of delineating

17

coverage.

18

The illogical and doctrinaire results created

19

by this test are well illustrated by the facts of this
✓

20 case.
21

Respondent Churchill, unlike land-based workers

who perform similar tasks, was constantly on, over,

22 surrounded by navigable waters.

He was faced with

23

unique marine dangers.

His work required the use of

24

protective marine gear.

25

specialized techniques to deal with the exigencies of

It required knowledge of

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

work on the water.

He was constantly required to load

2 and unload supply vessels.
3

Notwithstanding this unique marine nature of

4

his activities, the court below looked to sewage

5

treatment plant and asked whether it, not Respondent

6 Churchill, had some connection to maritime activities.
7

The illogic of this result is made patent when this case

8 is considered with another case arising from this same

2 The test utilized below is an impracticable means of

3 delineating the coverage of employment on the water.
4

QUESTIONi

How does the experience of this

5 Court show that the anomalies would be alleviated?
6

MS. WILKINS<

Well, I can answer that, but to

7 do that I need to go into a little bit of history, and I
8

9

would like to do that right now.
The test, the navigation or commerce test was

10

first adopted post-enactment by the Ninth Circuit in

11

Weyerhauser Company v. Gilmore.

12

stated that it was no help to consider the prior

The Court in that case

13 decisions of this and other federal courts that had
14 considered the question of the proper state and federal
15 jurisdiction under the Act.

The Court said that the

16 1972 amendments had instead instituted a clear line
17 between state and federal jurisdiction, but in
18 explicating this clear line, it explicitly relegated to
19 limbo, in the words of the Court, the Davis and Calbeck
20 decisions of this Court.
21

But in its hasty relegation to limbo of all

22 prior experience under the

Act, it failed to recognize

23 that the navigation or commerce test has been shown to
24 be completely unworkable and impracticable as a means of
25 delineating coverage.

For nearly 35 years following the

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

original enactment of the Longshoremen's Act, this and

2 other federal courts struggled under the maritime but
3 local doctrine to determine which employments on the
4 water were maritime or possessed a significant
5 relationship to navigation and commerce, and therefore
6 fell within federal coverage, and those that lacked that
7 elusive connection and therefore were maritime but local»
8

In 1942, in the Davis decision, this Court

9 noted that the lines that had been drawn over the water
10 were so fine, the decisions so confusing, that, Mr.
11 Justice Rehnquist, the Court stated that we could quote
12 cases on either side, for recovery or against recovery,
13 on the facts of the Davis case.
14

In light of this terrible morass of cases that

15 developed, the Court was forced to create the twilight
16 zone within which state and federal remedies
17 overlapped.

Twenty years later, in the Calbeck

18 decision, this Court further overlapped state and
19 federal remedies by declaring that federal jurisdiction
20 extended to all injuries that occurred on actual
21 navigable waters.

The Court concluded that this was

22 necessary to spare employees "the uncertainty, expense,
23 delay of fighting out in litigation whether their

24 particular cases fell within or without state acts under
25 the local concern doctrine.”

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

In short, all of the cases prior to Calbeck

1

2 under the maritime but local doctrine demonstrate, and
3

this Court finally recognized, that it was completely

4

unworkable and impracticable to draw a navigation or

5

commerce line between state and federal jurisdiction.

6

This Court, moreover, has been unwilling to relegate

7

this experience to limbo.

Two years ago, in the Sun

8 Ship decision, the Court declined to draw a similar line
9
10
11

between state and federal jurisdiction over land-based
injuries.
This case is very similar to the Sun Ship

12

decision, and should be decided as the Court decided the

13

Sun Ship decision, by harkening to the clarifying

14

opinions in Davis and Calbeck, and refusing to recreate

15

the jurisdictional monstrosity that those cases

16

eradicated.

17
18

QUESTIONS

Mr. Wilkins, may I ask you one other

question on this point?

19

MR. WILKINSs

20

QUESTIONS

21

Yes.

Does sustaining the government's

position in this case mean that there would be no

22 recovery under a state workmen's compensation statute
23
24
25

for this —
MR. WILKINS:

No, certainly not.

The entire

teaching of the Davis and Calbeck line of cases is that

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

state and federal jurisdiction is concurrent.

2

QUESTION*

Even over navigable water?

3

MR. WILKINS*

Even over navigable waters in

4 those areas that are within the maritime but local
5 sphere.
6

So this does not displace state jurisdiction to

any degree.

It simply alleviates the problems and the

7 confusion that are inherent in forcing workers to decide

8 in advance of litigation questions that courts will
9 regularly divide upon.
10

Indeed, unless this Court adopts the position,

11

the common sense position that all work on the water is

12 by its very nature maritime, thereby conforming the
13 judicial construction of the Act with the express
14 Congressional intent behind the
15

QUESTION:

1972 amendments —

Would you tell me what case it is

state that.

23

MR. WILKINS*

Sun Ship alludes to the history

24 in those cases, yes.

QUESTION*

Calbeck and Davis.

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. WILKINSs

Yes, exactly.

2

Unless this Court conforms its interpretation

3

of the Act with the express Congressional intent, it

4

will once again be embroiled in case by case

5 determinations of whether particular discrete factual
6

employments possess an elusive connection to navigation

7 or commerce.

For example, the court below rejected the

8 argument that Respondent Churchill was engaged in
9 maritime employment as a person engaged in longshoring
10

operations — that is the statutory language — because

11

he was required to load and unload caissons from supply

12 vessels.
13

The Fifth Circuit, however, on virtually

14 identical facts, has concluded that such employees are
15 engaged in maritime employment, and two petitions
16 currently before the Court ask this Court to settle this
17 particular controversy.
18

Another petition currently pending before the

19 Court questions the Fourth Circuit's conclusion that

20 workers injured on actual navigable waters while
21

building a bridge are engaged in maritime employment.

22 The Ninth Circuit has very recently determined that
23 workers injured on navigable waters building bridges are
24 not engaged in maritime employment.
25

In short, if this Court affirms the decision

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

below, this and other federal courts will once again

2

become embroiled in determining the outer limits of the

3 navigation and commerce test, an attempt that will
4

almost certainly be doomed to failure because, as the

5 Court noted in Calbeck, there has never been any method
6

of staking out those limits except in litigation in

7 particular cases.

As noted in a leading treatise on the basis

8
9

that there can be nothing more maritime than the sea,

10 every employment on the sea

11

or other navigable waters

should be considered maritime employment.

12

If there are no further questions —

13

QUESTIONS

Mr. Wilkins, I do have one.

Is it

14 settled that if the employee is not covered by the Act,
15 he retains his Seriacki seaworthiness action?

There

16 seemed to be a split maybe on that.

MB. WILKINSs

18 unclear.

There is something -- it is

Decisions out of the Fifth Circuit most

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN KRUTZEL, ESQ.

3

Mr. Krutzel?

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. KRUTZEL4

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

Two issues are presented for your
%
The first is whether the Director

6

8 of the Office of Workers Compensation Programs is a

9 proper party to seek review of the Second Circuit
10

decision below in this Court.

The second is whether

11

Raymond Churchill was at the time of his involvement in

12 the construction of a substructure for a sewage

13 treatment plant engaged in maritime employment within
14 the meaning of the federal Act.
15

We submit that the Article III, Section 3,

16 case and controversy requirement must — in satisfying
17 that requirement, the Director must show that he has
18 suffered an injury in fact or have a personal stake in
19 the outcome of the decision in order to have standing.
20 In this particular case, the Director must have some
21

pecuniary or administrative interest which has been

22 adversely affected by the decision below.

23

The Director concedes, I believe, that there

24 was no pecuniary involvement on behalf of the Office of
25 Workers' Compensation Programs and no pecuniary interest

Mr. Churchill is here as a

If the Director is found not to have proper

7 standing to seek review in this Court, no benefits could
8 be paid to Mr. Churchill.

9

The clear fact is that, even if Mr. Churchill

10

were a Petitioner, the Director would not be the party,

11

and the Government would not be the party, to pay any

12 benefits regardless of

the outcome of the case.

That

13 becomes solely the responsibility of the employer and
14 the insurance carrier.
QUESTION;

15

So you would eliminate Mr.

16 Churchill by reason of the fact he didn't petition for
17 cert?
18

MR. KRUTZEL;

19

The Director does, however, point to two

20 sections of

That is correct.

the Longshore and Harbor Workers'

21

Compensation Act for authority for the proposition that

22

he has an administrative interest which provides him

23 with the requisite personal stake in the outcome of the
24 action.

He points specifically to Section 39(c), which

25 requires that the Director provide information and

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

assistance to potential claimants under the Act.
However, that section does not require that

2
3

the Director has to agree with the information that he

4

provides to employees or potential compensation

5

claimants.

In fact, that section does not require that

6 the Director has to give information which is entirely
7 free from doubt.

It simply provides that he must give

8 information, and that information, we presume,

would be

9 based upon the state of the existing law.
10

QUESTION’S

Hell, as a matter — I take it your

11

argument is resting on Article III, not on a particular

12

statutory provision.

13

MR. KRUTZELs

14

QUESTION;

That is correct.

Hasn’t our general practice been

15 when a federal agency loses a case in which its actions
16 are being reviewed in a Court of Appeals that there's no
17 question from an Article III standpoint that the agency
18 can seek review of the Court of Appeals'
19

MR. KRUTZELs

20 Justice Rehnquist,
21

judgment here?

In this particular case, Mr.

I don't believe that the federal

agency has in fact lost the case.

What they did was

22 appear — they did not take part in the trial of the
23 case before the administrative law judge to any extent.
24 They petitioned for review before the Benefits Review
25 Board as a party in interest before the administrative

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

agency, and upon the Benefits Review Board’s affirmance

2 of the fact that Mr. Churchill was not an employee

3 engaged in maritime employment the Director did not
4 proceed further as a Petitioner.
5

He appeared merely as a Respondent, obviously

6

in recognition of the Second Circuit’s position that he

7 did not have standing to seek review in the federal
8

courts as a Petitioner.
Should the Court in this case not reach a

9

10 decision on
11

the merits, the Director can still give the

same information and advice to compensation claimants

12 pursuant to his responsibilities under Section 39 of the

13 Act.
In addition, the Director has argued today and

14

15 in his reply brief that self-insured employers who are
16 required to make certain showings to the Secretary of
17 Labor and his designee the Director pursuant to Section
18 32 of the Act in some way create an interest in the
19 Director which would satisfy the standing requirement.
However, certainly that section of the law is

20
21

not relevant to the facts in this case, as the employer,

22 Perini North River Associates, was covered by insurance

23 contracts.

In addition, that section creates no

24 affirmative duty on behalf of the Director to do
25 anything.

That section, rather, requires employers to

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

come forward and provide evidence that they are, if

2 going to be self-insured, capable of paying compensation

3 claims.
And certainly even that section, which if it

4

5 were interpreted to require the Director to provide
6 information

to potential employers under the Act, is

7 subject to the same interpretation in that the Director
8 does not have to agree with the information he imparts.

9 That is not what the law requires.
The Director's ability to dispense information

10

11

in this case will not be enhanced if standing is

12 accorded in this case.

The Courts, not the Director,

13 will ultimately determine the meaning of the law.
The federal courts, in order to hear a case,

14

15 must have and must require that concrete adverseness
16 which is not demonstrably present in this case.

We do

17 not argue that the Director won't, as a result of a
18 decision on the merits, be able to give more certain
19 advice and information, but merely that his function as
20 the transmitter of that information will not be affected
21

by the outcome of the decision below.

14 case, which had initially been decided the same day as
15 — had been argued, excuse me, the same day as Director
16 against — as the Tanzen case, reaffirmed its position
17 that the Director was not a proper party to petition
18 this Court for review.
19

In addition, the United States Court of

20 Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the Donzi Marine case,

21

which held that the Director could not properly petition

22 a federal court for review, that circuit reaffirmed that

23 analysis just recently in 1982 in the Miller case.
24 Those decisions would seem to indicate that the Court of
25 Appeals, at least the Second and the Fifth Circuit, have

clearly shows that some workers injured

because they were not engaged in maritime

The Court in that decision stated clearly,

9 especially when it discussed the case of Parker v. Motor
10 Boat

11

Sales, that that individual would not be covered if

the test focused upon the job that the employee was

12 engaged

13

for.
Historically, the maritime employment standard

14 clearly reguired some nexus to navigation and commerce
15 over navigable waters.

I think it is important, though,

16 that a review of the statutory language itself does not
17 support the Director's argument.

Throughout the

16

As a matter of fact, since the inception of

the Act from 1927 at least to the advent of the Davis

19

whether or not those employees could be provided a

21

the reach of the federal act.

That is correct.

MR. KRUTZELs

That is correct.

limits of federal

because that was the area of

This does not -- the Calbeck decision in our

11
12

view does not overrule the cases which preceded it in

13 terms of maritime but local, but only serves to
14 reinforce the then accepted principle that the admiralty
15 tort jurisdiction, since the Act is based in admiralty,
16 tort and contract jurisdiction, could apply to injuries
17 over navigable waters, that being the area of the
18 federal concern.

in Section 2, subdivision (3) of the Act clearly show,

employment is related to that industry.

To read the Act

as the Director suggests does harm, irreparable

violence, in our view, to Section 2, subdivision (4),

6

which now states that:

7

employer any of whose employees are employed in maritime

"The term 'employer* means an

8 employment in whole or in part upon the navigable waters
9

of the United States.”
To read that section with the Director's

10
11

interpretation of the Act would change the language to

12

be*

13

employees are employed on navigable waters as previously

14

existed before 1972, in whole or in part upon the

15

navigable waters of the United States."

We submit that Congress in enacting the 1972

17

amendments and in using the two phrases, "maritime

18

employment" and "navigable waters", intended to provide

19

distinct and separate meanings to those phrases.

20

Historically, the area of federal concern did

21

relate to navigation and commerce.

There is no question

22

that in a number of decisions interpreting the 1972 Act

23

this Court has, particularly when discussing the

24

maritime but local cases, required a nexus between the

25

activity and traditional concepts of navigation and

38

1 commerce on navigable water .
2

This Court's decisions in Calbeck and Nacirema

3 make it clear that the scope of the 1927 Act required
4 coverage for employees injured over actual navigable
5 waters.

It was clearly stated in the Nacirema decision

6 that the language of the statute -- that is, the
7 language that Congress in 1927 employed — arbitrarily
8 eliminated from coverage many employees whose work did
9 affect navigation and commerce, particularly so in view
10 of the advent of modern cargo-handling techniques which
11 brought much of the longshoremen's usual work onto
12 shore.
13

The Court in Nacirema suggested that Congress

14 could extend coverage shoreward based upon its power
15 over admiralty contract jurisdiction, providing that the
16 parties cover the status of the longshoremen performing
17 that maritime contract.

18
19 decided

And this Court's decisions in Executive Jet,
after the 1972 amendments in 19 — later that

20 year — showed that the admiralty tort jurisdiction has
21 now been rationalized with this Court's discussion of
22 admiralty contract jurisdiction, so that both require a
23 nexus to traditional navigation or commerce over
24 navigable waters.
25

The 1972 amendments show that Congress

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

accepted this Court’s invitation in Nacirema to cure the

2 arbitrary application of the Act by providing that they
3

will cover now for the first time the status of the

4

injured worker and not simply refer to the location of

5

that injury.

Congress therefore expanded the situs of

6 coverage to eliminate the situation of shifting and
7

fortuitous coverage, as was renounced certainly in the

8

dissent in Nacirema and also alluded to by the majority

9

opinion.
For the first time, Congress confined the

10
11

recovery to those individuals which it affirmatively

12

described as the subject class of its concern, and the

13

examples make clear that that class was individuals

14

whose work affected navigation and commerce over

15

navigable waters.
Now, the Director has argued that the standard

16
17

adopted by the court below, which is that the work must

18

have some relationship, significant relationship to

19

traditional navigation and commerce over navigable

20 waters,
21

is unworkable.

But it is clear that in adopting

the occupational status test Congress required that the

22 inquiry be made in each case regarding whether this
23

employee's activities are in the area that Congress was

24

concerned with protecting.

25

Even the Director's test would seem to

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

indicate that the navigation and commerce test would be

2

required at least, in his view, to those employees who

3 were injured on the covered shoreside area, although he
4 intends that a different test, a situs test of maritime
5 employment, be used to determine coverage for injuries
6

over pre-1972 navigable waters.
The Director's test would arbitrarily,

7
8

apparently, exclude from coverage an employee whose

9 status — who would fail the maritime occupational
10

status test while on shore, but apparently cover the

11

same employee if he happened to fall into the water.

12 That is precisely the dilemma that Congress attempted to

13 cure in the 1972 amendments by no longer focusing the
14 area of concern on the situs, but rather looking tc the
15 actual work that the injured worker performed.
He submit that the standard adopted by the

16

17 court below is flexible enough to accommodate any new
18 changes in cargo-handling techniques that injured
19 workers may come into effect with, and we submit that
20 the
21

standard focuses upon the industry, the purpose of

which Congress was concerned, that being the movement of

22 goods in maritime commerce or navigation.

23

I should also like to point out t ha,t the

24 Director has made reference to one particular case in
25 the Second Circuit which he indicates creates some

conflict a van within tha circuit concerning coverage for

2 employees at this construction project.

He mentions

3

specifically Matson v. Perini North River Associates,

4

but I think it is clear that the Second Circuit did not

5

reach a decision on the merits in that case.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. WILKINS, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10

MR. WILKINS;

11
12

13

Just a few points, Mr. Chief

Justice.
We’d like to make certain that there's no

14

misunderstanding regarding the standing of the Director

15

in this Court.

16

Director as a party to petition for a writ of

17

certiorari.

18

28 U.S.C. 1254 plainly allows the

There’s no serious case or controversy

guestion in this rase because Respondent Churchill is

receive or be denied benefits.

He will either

This is not, as the

22 Valley Forge case, as in the words in the Valley Forge
23
24
25

case, a mere college debating forum.
We have very little to add on the merits of
our case except to note that the Fifth Circuit in a

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

recent en banc decision voted 12 to 2 to adopt in full

2 the position of the Director.

3

As Mr. Justice Frankfurther noted in his

4 concurring opinion in Davis:

"Any legislative scheme

5 that compensates workmen or their families for
6 industrial mishaps should be capable of simple and

7 dependable enforcement."
8

We urge this Court to adopt

the commonsense view that employment on the water is

9 maritime, rather than becoming embroiled in formalistic
10 inquiries as to whether particular employments possess
11

that elusive connection.

12

Thank you.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

14 The case is submitted. ,

(Whereupon, at 2:02 p.m., the case in the

16 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
