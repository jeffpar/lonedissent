CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think you may proceed

whenever you’re ready, Mr. Frey.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The claimant in this case arrived in Los
Angeles from Vancouver, Canada on September 10th, 1975.

10

On her Customs form was a question asking whether she

11

was carrying with her more than $5,000 in currency.

12

That question was answered "No.”

13

During the course of the Customs inspection

14

process she was three times further asked whether she

15

had on her person more than $5,000 in currency and three

16

times denied it.

17

Because of suspicions of the Customs officers

18

she was searched, and the search revealed an envelope

19

concealed in her brassiere containing $8,850 in United

20

States currency.

21

this money was there, because when the Customs inspector

22

counted the money and erroneously said it's $9,950, she

23

said I know it’s less than that.

24
25

It’s quite clear that she knew that

Now, the issue in this case is whether the
Government -- this money was seized, by the way — and
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the issue is whether the Government was required to

2

bring a juiicial forfeiture action promptly following

3

the procedure without regard to the pendancy of any

4

criminal investigation or prosecution, and without

5

regard to the pendancy of an administrative proceeding

6

for possible remission of mitigation of the forfeiture.

7

And if there was some improper delay in bringing the

8

action, whether the remedy was to return the money to

9

the claimant despite the fact that she was not injured

10

in any way by the delay.

11

Now, in order to place this issue in context

12

for the Court I’d like to describe briefly the Customs

13

forfeiture procedures.

14

is a prompt post-seizure notice given to the — any

15

person who Customs is aware has — may have an interest

16

in the item.

17

allowed 60 days to file an administrative petition with

18

the Secretary of the Treasury for remission or

19

mitigation.

20

After an item is seized, there

This notice advises them that they are

QUESTIONi

Mr. Frey, may I just ask, in this

21

description are you describing the procedure under the

22

Bank Secrecy Act or other forfeitures as well?

23

SR. FREYi

Kell, Customs employs the — the

24

Bank Secrecy Act itself has no procedural previsions,

25

and they employ the general Customs provisions for the

1

2

administrative remission process.
QUESTION;

Is — is — is your position that

3

this case is typical of all forfeitures, or do we have a

4

special problem under the Bank Secrecy Act in this case?

5

MR. FREY:

No.

I think, this case is

6

reflective of a general problem that we have had with

7

forfeitures being barred on account of alleged

8

unconstitutional delay.

9

I’ll get to later of the currency statute which make

There are some attributes which

10

this, I think, a particularly strong case for the

11

Government; but I will come to those.

12

QUESTION;

But generally we could consider it

13

pretty much the same as say the seizure of a boat or an

14

automobile and a narcotic?

15
16
17

MR. FREY:

I don’t think there are any

material differences, yes.
Now, the claimants, as I say, are allowed 60

18

days to file a petition for remission or mitigation, and

19

it’s quite clear from the statute that the decision

20

whether to grant remission or to mitigate the penalty

21

involved in a forfeiture is within the essentially

22

unfetterd discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury or

23

his delagatee.

24
25

Now, if an administration petition is filed,
the practice is not to file a judicial forfeiture action
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

until the administrative petition is decided.

If no

2

petition is filed, then the practice normally is to

3

refer the latter promptly to the United States Attorney

4

for judicial action.

5

Now, I should point out that under the current

6

statutes, the judicial action is required only where the

7

value of the object to be forfeited exceeds £10,000.

8

the time of this seizure it was £5,000, I believe, or

9

£2,500.

10

QUESTION*

11

for remission here?

12

ME. FREY*

At

What justification was presented

Well, in this case, as I understand

13

it, the claimant asserted that she was not aware of her

14

obligation to declare the money, because she believed

15

that only money that had been acquired abroad would have

16

to be declared.

17

she gave.

18

I think that was the main reason that

QUESTION*

That she had carried it from the

19

United States outside and then was bringing it back on

20

the way to Canada, is that --

21

MR. FREY*

Yes.

22

QUESTION*

That was the only justification?

23

MR. FREY:

Well, I — I — actually the

24

appendix does not contain the letter, and I have not

25

read the letter of remission; so that is my
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

understanding as to what her principal justification

2

was.

3

But my colleague can perhaps fill that in.
In any event, if the matter involved is worth

4

less than $10,000, it's disposed of administratively

5

unless the claimant posts a bond for cost to obtain a

6

judicial proceeding.

7

judicial action is filed.

8
9

If it’s worth more than $10,000, a

Now, also the pendancy of a criminal
investigation or a criminal prosecution will ordinarily

10

delay both the decision on the remission petition and

11

the filing of the judicial forfeiture action.

12

Another point that I think is pertinent is

13

that once the case is referred to the United States

14

Attorney for civil in rem forfeiture proceedings, there

15

is no further processing or entertaining by Customs of

16

an application for remission or mitigation.

17

Now, in most cases the jurisdiction to

18

entertain such application shifts to the Department of

19

Justice, to the Attorney General; and under the

20

regulations, the Attorney General's standards for

21

granting relief are much stricter, he is much less

22

generous in granting relief than the Secretary of the

23

Treasury after.there has been a judicial forfeiture

24

proceeding.

25

In the case of currency seizures it is not
7

1

absolutely clear and it is not settled whether the

2

Attorney General would have jurisdiction or whether it

3

would stay with the Secretary of Treasury for a

4

mitigation petition because of the wording of the

5

particular statute; but it*s not material to this case.
Let me also say a word about the substantive

6
7

standards for currency forfeitures.

31 U.S.C. 1102 —

8

and I am told this has been recently recodified, and I

9

don’t have the section number — requires only two

10

things;

11

the United States of currency or monetary instruments in

12

excess of $5,000, and that they have not been declared.

13

Any currency so transported and not declared is

14

forfeitable.

15

that there has been transportation in or out of

There is no requirement for a civil forfeiture

that the person knew or understood that he or she was

17

unier a duty to make this report.

18

requirement that they had to know that they were in fact

19

carrying the money on their person, but that's not in

20

question in this case.

There may be a

21

Now, this is in contrast to the criminal

22

prosecution for this violation which would have an

23

element of willfulness which the lower courts have

24

construed to require knowledge of the reporting

25

requirement.
8

Let me go briefly through the procedural

1

2

chronology of this case.

The seizure occurred on

3

September 10th.

4

September 28th of 1975, and on October 20th the case was

5

assigned to a Customs agent for investigation.

A remission petition was filed on

Between October 1975 and April 1976 her

6

7

investigation largely focused on whether the money that

8

was being transported by the claimant and was not

9

declared was being used as part of some criminal

10

activity.

11

currency seizure cases, and one of the reasons this,

12

apart from the fact that there is commonly such an

13

association and the discovery of the money may be a lead

14

to uncover other criminal activity, is that the decision

15

whether to prosecute as a misdemeanor or a felony may

16

depend on whether the money was being transported in

17

connection with some other criminal activity, in which

18

case a felony is involved.

19

This, I am told, is a standard practice in

In May of 1976 the case was referred for

20

prosecution to the United States Attorney.

An

21

indictment was returned on June 15th of 1976, and it

22

contained both a misdemeanor count charging the failure

23

to declare the currency and a felony count for false

24

statements to the Customs officer denying the possession

25

of $5,000 during the interrogation.
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

The trial was held in December of 1976, and at

1

2

the conclusion of the trial the jury convicted

3

respondent or claimant of the false statement counts and

4

acquitted on the felony transportation — on the

5

misdemeanor currency transportation count.

6

on her appeal the false statement counts were reversed

7

because of inadvertent leaving of the court file in the

8

jury room.
QUESTION;

9

Subsequently

What is the statute governing the

10

— the statutory section governing the false statement

11

count?

12

MR. FREY;

1001, 18 U.S.C. 1001.

13

Now, following this, approximately three

14

months after the verdict in the criminal case the

15

remission petition was denied, and the case was referred

16

to the United States Attorney for a judicial forfeiture

17

action which was filed on March 22nd, 1977,

18

approximately 18 months after the original seizure.

19

In January of 1978 the district court entered

20

its judgment upholding the forfeiture and holding that

21

the delay in instituting the forfeiture proceeding was

22

reasonable under the circumstances.

23

Somewhat over three years later the Court of

24

Appeals decided the appeal, held that the Government

25

took too long in filing the judicial forfeiture action.
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Their holding is summarized at page 4A of the appendix

2

to the petition for writ of certiorari.

3

said, "The administrative or criminal investigations

4

cannot justify the Government's delay when the necessary

5

elements for a forfeiture were established at the time

6

of the seizure."

7

And the court

And then went on to hold that prejudice is

8

irrelevant to the claim, and without regard to prejudice

9

the claimant is entitled to a return of the property.
«

10

Now, in order to sustain the judgment of the

11

Court of Appeals, claimant must persuade the Court to

12

find in its favor on three issues, each of three issues.

13

QUESTIONS

Mr. Frey, before you get into your

14

main argument, may I ask one other procedural question?

15

In your brief you indicate that the Government prevails

16

in about 80 percent of these —

17

MR. FREY s ■ Well —

18

QUESTIONS

19

-- Cases other than those where

there’s delay involved.

Well, whatever the figure is.

20

MR. FREYs

I think it’s considerably higher.

21

QUESTION;

Say it's 90 percent.

But take the

22

10 percent in which you don't prevail.

Say on the

23

merits, not for reasons of delay, the person gets the

24

property back.

compensation for the time that --

MR. FREYs

I should say that under —

18

QUESTIONi

How — how about an action under

19
20

the Federal Tort Claims Act or under the Tucker Act?
MR. FREYs

Well, Section 2680(c) of Title 28,

21

which is a Federal Tort Claims Act provision, seems to

22

bar any claim for delay — for damages due to a delay in

23

connection with a Customs seizure.

24

a matter of policy not to permit it.

25

Congress decided as

As far as the Tucker Act was concerned, that
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

was an issue that was involved in the Hatzlatch case.

2

The Court lid not decide it, and I have serious doubts

3

whether there would be a Tucker Act action.

4

have to be based on some implied contract.

It would

I should say that under the Department of

5
6

Justice's procedures, any adverse decision in one of

7

these forfeiture cases is supposed to be reported to the

8

Solicitor General's Office for a decision whether or not

9

to appeal.

And I, apart from this delay issue that is

10

before the Court today, the due process issue, I don't

11

see more than half a dozen a year.

12

all be reported to me, but I think the incidence is

13

slight.

14

Now, they may not

In any event, in order to sustain the judgment

15

of the Court of Appeals, the first thing that claimant

16

must convince you of is that there exists a general due

17

process requirement of prompt filing of a judicial

18

action following a seizure of goods for forfeiture.

19

Secondly, they must persuade you that due

20

process does not allow the Government to defer such a

21

filing on account of the pendancy of a criminal

22

investigation or prosecution or an administrative

23

petition for remission or mitigation.

24
25

And thirdly, they must persuade you that the
proper remedy for any violation of due process involved
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

in failing to file promptly enough is automatic denial

2

of the forfeiture, wholly without regard to whether the

3

claimant suffered any injury whatsoever by virtue of the

4

impermissible delay.
I'd like to first make a couple of preliminary

5

6

observations.

The first one is apparently a somewhat

7

old-fashioned idea that's gone out of favor with some of

8

the lower courts, and that is the statute of limitations

9

that Congress enacted governing the time within which

10

actions of this sort must be brought, which is five

11

years.

12
13
14
15
16

Now, the second thing, turning to this case in
particular -QUESTIONS

Why do you say that's gone out of

favor with some of the lower courts?
MR. FREY;

Well, it's been largely ignored in

17

numerous cases.

18

the Lovasco case, for instance, the Court reminded that

19

the statute of limitations is the principal protection

20

with regard to delay in the institution of judicial

21

proceedings.

22
23

I think not with this Court because in

But the Court of Appeals —

QUESTION;

Yes, but if the Government has

already seized the property and is holding it --

24

MR. FREY;

Well, the statute of limitations --

25

QUESTION;

-- And so you've — it’s sort of
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

like you've started the case, in a sense.

2

the money, and you just aren’t give it back.

3

think you could wait five years.

4
5

QUESTION*

You've got
And you

Well, Congress has said you could

wait five years.

6

MR. FREYs

That is correct.

7

QUESTION*

Well, you could wait five years to

8

start your action, but that doesn’t say you can wait

9

five years to seize the property.

10

MR. FREYs

Well, you could wait — it's clear

11

that the statute of limitations contemplates the

12

possibility or the likelihood that the property will

13

have been seized because it’s five years from the date

14

of discovecy of the offense.

15

QUESTION;

Well, for example —

16

MR. FREY*

I don’t —

17

QUESTION*

-- There’s a statute of limitations

18

in criminal cases, too, but you can’t — can’t arrest a

19

person and then just wait five years to prosecute.

20

MR. FREYs

Well, if — we — we make the point

21

in our brief that if you were to analogize the seizure

22

to the arrest of the person and apply the speedy trial

23

analysis — which I assume if you could meet the speedy

24

trial test you would also comply with due process

25

requirements -- that the claimant would not prevail in
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

this case under the four factor speedy trial analysis*

2

because while the length of the delay arguably would

3

satisfy the requirements, she could not — there are

4

good reasons for the delay.

5

QUESTION*

Right.

6

NR. FREY*

There is no prejudice; and there

7

never was a demand for the filing of a judicial

8

proceeding.

9

QUESTION ;

Well, that's part of your argument.

10

NR. FREY*

That is part of our argument.

11

QUESTION*

Well, Mr. Frey —

12

NR. FREY;

I'm going to try to work it on in

13

response to questions.

14

QUESTION;

Now you know the best way you can.

15

QUESTION*

You do concede that due process

16

rights are triggered by a Government seizure of

17

someone's property, I suppose; to have a hearing on the

18

seizure at, what, a meaningful or reasonable time, is

19

that right?

20

NR. FREY;

Well, that's — we — we do concede

21

that there -- that the claimant, even though

22

retrospectively title passed to the Government, at least

23

at the time of the seizure, in our view, we do concede

24

that in approaching this case the Court should recognize

25

the existence of a property interest that requires some
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

due process.
QUESTION:

A property interest that was seized

3

that triggers some due process right to a hearing at

4

some reasonable or meaningful time.

5

HR . FREY*

In a meaningful time.

And —

6

QUESTION;

And it’s your argument that the

7

statute of limitations provides for the meaningful time,

8

is that right?

9

MR. FREY;

Well, it is our argument that in

10

general if their delay in instituting the action is not

11

motivated by some invidious attempt to gain a tactical

12

advantage that due process is satisfied by a hearing

13

within the statute of limitations, taking into account

14

the other remedies that are available to a person whose

15

property has been seized if they wish to secure an

16

earlier hearing on certain aspects of the matter.

17

QUESTION*

Mr. Frey, isn’t there a sort of a

18

piece of paper that could be filed at the same time that

19

the person is taken into custody which would protect the

20

Government?

21

22

MR. FREY;

Well, we think that is a very bad

idea that is —

23

QUESTION;

But it is possible, isn’t it?

24

SR. FREY:

It would be possible in most of

25

these cases to file a complaint rather rapidly, but
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

there are a lot of costs associated with that

2

of costs, in our view.
QUESTION*

3

a lot

Well, I know of one case in which

4

all they did, they just filed a jeopardy assessment

5

against the guy.

He was going out of the country.

MR. FREY*

6

Well, now you're — you're in an

7

area that I don't know very much about which is tax

8

liens.
QUESTION*

9

But I mean I'm just wondering about

10

if you seize contraband, that's one thing, but this is

11

good, solid money and it's not contraband.

12

MR. FREY*

Right.

Not contraband per se.

13

QUESTION*

The money is the crime itself.

You will also cut off the only right that is

to petition for administrative relief from the

Whether there would be a

But that’s pretty far —

Now, let me point out that the claimant in

this case has never asked to have a judicial proceeding

brought, and she had good reasons for not asking because

the judicial proceeding would have been an open and

Now, this is generally true in all of these

forfeiture delay cases that I have seen.

The last thing

4

the claimant wants is the prompt filing of a judicial

action.

remission has been denied that the action hasn't been

prompt enough at a point where the filing of the action

can no longer hurt them or it's actually occurred.

They just want to complain after the — if

9

I wanted to clarify one other point before I

10

got into more substantive matters, and that is there’s

11

been some discussion about the difference in the meaning

12

of forfeiture statutes that say "shall be forfeited" and

13

"subject to forfeiture."

14

And just yesterday it came to my attention

15

that there is a House and a Senate report that you

16

should look at which explain the view of Congress in

17

1935 at least, that the "subject to forfeiture" language

18

means the title vests in the United States for the

19

purposes of this relation back doctrine at the time of

20

the seizure, whereas "shall be forfeited" means that

21

title vests at the time of the offense.

22

there would be no difference for this purpose of the

23

present case.

1

I see my time is running short

I just want

2

to make the point that due process requires an

3

opportunity to be heard in a meaningful time, and in

4

deciding whether the prompt filing of a judicial action

5

is necessary to provide such an opportunity, you do have

6

to look at what the options are that are available to

7

the rare claimant who might actually want the prompt

8

filing of a judicial action.

9

First of all, he cannot file or withdraw his

10

administrative remission petition which will normally

11

produce the prompt judicial filing.

12

claims that the seizure itself was unlawful, the Rule

13

41(e) remedy for return of property is available.

14

Secondly, if he

Now, this is significant because the class of

15

cases that we’re talking about here in terms of

16

assessing the risk of error in determining what process

17

is due is the class of cases in which the items were

18

seized with probable cause to believe that they were

19

subject to forfeiture.

20

In that class of cases the risk of error is

21

very slight.

This is especially true in these currency

22

cases, because all you need to prove is events that

23

happened right there in front of the Customs inspectors

24

the discovery of the money and the fact of

25

nondeclaration.

So the risk of error in this class of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF VICTOR SHERMAN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SHERMAN;

10
11

Very well.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court;
The first question, as to whether or not the

12

due process clause requires a prompt post-seizure

13

hearing anl as to whether or not the statute of

14

limitation is the only limitation of the Government,

15

first of all, 19 U.S.C. Section 1621, which is the

16

applicable statute of limitations, says that the action

17

must be instituted within five years after the time when

18

the alleged offense was discovered.

19

Obviously, if the Government believes that a

20

crime has occurred or that a forfeiture is appropriate

21

and they do not seize the person's property, they have

22

five years within to bring an action.

23

statute of limitations.

24

the property — and this Court has already indicated in

25

the Pierson Yacht case in 1974 that once an item has

That's the normal

However, when they have seized

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

been seized under a forfeiture proceeding, there is an

2

emergency reason not to comply with the normal rule that

3

before seizure you are to give a person notice and a

4

hearing.

5

It's only in the rare instance where because

6

of other governmental interest such as in the Pierson

7

Yacht case or potentially in this case that you can

8

seize the property and merely postpone the hearing.

9

once the event has happened, there is no reason to delay

10

the hearing beyond the requirement of the due process

11

prompt hearing requirement.

12

And

And I believe the Government has cited no

13

cases, and there are no cases, either at the District

14

Court, Court of Appeals, or Supreme Court that says the

15

Government has up to the statute of limitations.

16

rule has always been that once the property is seized,

17

you are required to give a prompt post-seizure hearing.

18

The Government has —

19

QUESTION;

20

MR. SHERMAN*

The

Well, is that a constitutional rule?
Certainly, first of all, since

21

the Government concedes that the remission petitions are

22

to be decided under 19 U.S.C., Sections 1602, 1603 and

23

1604 have been interpreted by the various courts to

24

apply to this situation.

25

seizure has occurred the seizing officer is to

officer; there's to be an immediate investigation and an

3

appraisal of the property under 1603, and then the

4

matter referred to the United States Attorney's Office;

5

and 1604 to be a filing of the action forthwith.

6

The Court has indicated in the First Amendment

7

area in the Thirty-Seven Photographs case that in order

8

to save the facial constitutionality of the section in

9

that particular case, it read into this statute certain

10

time limitations — 14 days for a preliminary hearing as

11

to whether or not the particular film in question --

12

QUESTION!

Well, you’re not suggesting that

13

any First Amendment interest is involved in a certain

14

amount of money, are you?

15

MR. SHERMANs

No.

What I am suggesting is

16

that in other areas the Court has said that promptitude

17

or promptness is required.

18

particular area the due process clause also is

19

applicable.

20

And I'm saying in this

Although this is a Fifth Amendment area and

21

not a First Amendment area, and potentially the time

22

restraints may be somewhat different depending upon the

23

interest involved, certainly the principle that

24

something has to be done within a prompt period of time

25

and that the due process clause has a role to play in
28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

that determination is applicable in this case.
And I believe that any argument that says that

2
3

once the Government seizes an individual's property and

4

can sit on it for five years and has to do nothing is

5

foreign to every single court from the Magna Carta

6

onward who has even discussed this point.

7

reason the Government is unable to cite any cases that

8

says they can wait five years is because there are no

9

cases because everybody assumes —

Well, I suppose we don’t have to

11

decide that to resolve this case, do we, because the

12

Government didn't wait that long, and you don't have to

18

resolve that.

14

the delay, which involved waiting for the resolution of

15

the criminal action, in effect, did amount to a

meaningful time for the provision of the judicial

proceeding.

What you have to resolve here is whether

And this is where the facts

become extremely important, and that's why the

Government's continued assertion that the petitioner did

21

not want a prompt hearing is totally belied by the

22

record.

23

First of all, if the Court will note that the

24

day after the seizure occurred, I wrote a letter on

25

behalf of the claimant indicating the reason the funds

1

were not reported and the mistake of fact which the

2

petitioner or the claimant was under due to the

3

confusing Customs form given to her on the airplane; and

4

that we wanted a prompt hearing of the matter; and that

5

we wanted to know the reasons if there was to be a

6

denial of the petition, and the standard under which the

7

Secretary was making the decision.

8

thereafter I wrote letters to Customs asking for reasons

9

if there was going to be denial and to handle the matter

10

And consistently

promptly.
How, at all times Customs agent Janet Pompeo,

11
12

in this case, related to me that this was a civil

13

forfeiture proceeding and never gave any indication

14

whatsoever there was going to be a criminal case.

15

this is where the bad faith of the Government comes in.

interview of the claimant, when at the same time all

you're trying to do is getting — is get an

MR. SHERMAN:

Well, again. Justice O'Connor,

that's all, not bad faith, isn't that right?
MR. SHERMAN:

Again, they did not use the

words "bad faith."
Justice Marshall, as far as bringing another

22

type of action, the Government claims that we could have

23

filed a 41(e) action in order to test the legality or

24

the propriety of the seizure.

25

First of all, that would not go to whether or

2

federal criminal rule procedure 54(b)(5) which states

3

that you may not use a 41(e) action in a forfeiture

we can't even file a 41(e) motion.

10

Hell, then I amend my question.

Did you try to file any legal action?
NR. SHERHANs

No, I did not try to file any

legal action.

11

Also, under Snidiak and Fuentes the Court has

12

specifically held and indicated that it's not up to the

13

persons whose property has been seized in order to go to

14

court to try to file or force the issue; it's the person

15

who has seized the property that has the primary

16

responsibility in the action.

17

In this particular case it's the Government

18

that seizes an individual's property.

They set up a

procedure which says if you can show that there’s been

is where the Government attempted to take advantage,

tactical advantage, which is mentioned in Footnote 17 of

14

Lovasco, because if they would have gotten a criminal

conviction under 1101 — excuse me -- they would have

utilized that as a forfeiture under 1102, and then the

person was acquitted.

QUESTION;

And this

Mr. Sherman, it sounds to me as

19

though it's pretty logical for the Government agents,

20

for the Treasury Department to investigate in connection

21

with a remission petition whether there's some

22

underlying criminal activity afoot; that that's an

23

appropriate thing to do in deciding whether some

administrative petition to return the money is

25

appropriate to grant.

6

Government concedes that if I would have filed no

petition whatsoever within a 60-day period that very

8

soon thereafter they would have been required to file a

judicial forfeiture action.

So if I would have done

NR. SHERMAN*

Well, yes, because the court

11

the jury room, and so the Court of Appeals held that

12

they were obviously influenced by extrinsic matters, and

13

so they reversed the conviction.

say that the jury found her guilty based upon

appropriate evidence, and now since they didn’t retry

give her a clean bill of health either.
MR. SHERMAN;

Well, they acquitted her.

Well,

20

Your Honor, I think that’s an unfair comment in a sense

21

to make under the facts of this case, but if we want to

22

carry it one step further, they did give her a clean

23

bill of health as to whether or not she filed the 1101

24

reporting form.

25

They acquitted her.

QUESTION;

Well, they didn’t give her a clean

But if the Government is waiting until a jury makes a

decision as to whether or not the appropriate form was

filed, and they give her a clean bill of health and say

10

not guilty, and the Government has used as a tactical

advantage this time period in which to try to get a jury

12

to make that determination, then they lose and they say

That is totally not true.

There’s a Section 31, U.S.C. Section 1103, and

forfeiting the item, another alternative is for the

4

Secretary to assess a fine against the offender and

5

assess that fine giving credit for any amount of -- the

6

amount of the forfeited item.

7

So if, for instance, the Government delays in

8

bringing the forfeiture action and loses the ability to

9

forfeit that particular item, they can obtain the same

result by filing an action under 31 U.S.C.

But if the Court permits or reverses the Court

can deal with you in an honest fashion, they can ask for

prompt action within the remission procedures, they can

19

rely upon your representation the remission procedures

20

are what you are considering, they can hold that

property for an indefinite period up to five years, and

there's nothing you can do to complain about it, unless

MR. SHERMANs

you of anything.

And since nobody is under any

If we were going to use an analogy to any of

the prior decisions, obviously the Barker case. Barker

11

v. Wingo, is more applicable because we can analogize

12

the seizure of property to the seizure of a person.

was addressing.

14

MR. SHERMANs

I’m sorry.

15

But, again, the reason she reported it that

16

way, because she had already been informed through the

17

Customs declaration form that she understood it to mean

18

that she only had to tell them she had more than $5,000

if she acquired the money abroad.

shouldn't that have been her answer?

QUESTION:

And you're not asking us to review

-- to review that determination.

7

MR. SHERMAN:

Well, I'm asking you to review

8

it in the sense that if we assume that the remission

petition are subject to due process requirements, which

10

I believe they are, that — and no reason was given in

11

the remission —

12

QUESTION:

Well, aren't you just arguing even

13

a guilty person is entitled to a fair trial?

14

you're arguing.

15

MR. SHERMAN:

16

QUESTION:

That's all

Exactly.

So you can assume for purposes of

17

that argument that she’s "guilty" in the sense that she

18

loses on the merits in the forfeiture case.

19

MR. SHERMAN:

Yes.

I'm asking that even a

20

guilty person is entitled to procedural due process.

21

And I would hope that the Court would agree with that,

22

as I’m sure they do.

23

QUESTION:

Yes, but you're also -- you're

24

saying more than that.

Entitled to due process, but if

25

they don’t get it, the entire proceeding must fail.

MR. SHERMAN;

Hell, Barker v. Wingo says that

even though it may be a harsh result for purposes of the

3

Government to dismiss the action, that's the only

remedy.

5

remedy is more exclusionary than an exclusionary rule or

6

reversal for a new trial, but it is the only possible

remedy."

And I will quote from Barker.

It says, "Such a

Right from this Court’s own mouth that is the

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, Mr. Sherman.

Do you have anything further, Mr. Frey?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL

14

MR. FREY;

Yes, I do, Mr. Chief Justice.

15

First of all, on this question of remedy, not

16

even Fuentes v. Shevin on which my colleague relies,

17

even though it's quite distinguishable, provides that

18

the creditor's rights are extinguished.

19

QUESTION;

What about Barker?

20

MR. FREY;

Well, I'm not sure that — I'm not

21

sure that Barker is — is an analogous situation for

22

purposes of remedy.

23

QUESTION;

I mean it's -Well, are you arguing that even if

24

there was unreasonable delay, the proceeding should not

25

2

MR. FREY*

Yes, definitely.

3

QUESTION;

Well, what about Parker?

4

MR. FREY:

Well, I don’t think there — I

5

think there the proper analogy is to Carey v. Piphus.

6

That is, prejudice is an element except in the Barker

7

situation where there is an explicit constitutional

8

provision on the speedy — on speedy trial.

9

talking about due process, and the Court has said that

Here we’re

10

in the absence of prejudice, you may be entitled to

11

nominal damages because there is a desire and there is

12

an interest in adhering to fair process even if you're

13

not prejudiced by it.
But it’s crystal clear in this case.

14

In fact,

15

this remedy is exactly backwards.

16

like the exclusionary rule.

17

should not be forfeited — that is, people who -- who’ve

18

been injured by the delay, they get nothing out of this

19

remedy because they're going to get their property back

20

anyway.

21

remedy are people to whom the delay made no difference

22

except to defer the date on which title to property was

23

quieted in the United States.

24

very much sense to me.

25

It’s a little bit

For people whose property

Now, with respect to Section 1103 which my

1

colleague mentioned for the first time today, I am

2

advised that that section is a section that deals with

3

the situation where the discovery of the illegal

4

transportation of the currency occurs after it’s too

5

late to seize it, but that in cases where the currency

6

is seized, that section has no application.

I mean most of

Well, that's why -- that's why the

need for a prompt judicial filing, which is in fact
