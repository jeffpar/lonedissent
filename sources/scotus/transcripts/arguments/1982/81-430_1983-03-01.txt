ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL P. BIEBEL, JR., ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BIEBELi

6
7

Thank you very much,

Your Honor.

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

9

This case was originally argued before this

10

Court on October 13, 1982, and the question of the

11

applicability of the Aguilar-Spinelli standard to this

12

case where an anonymous letter was involved .

3

However, on November 29,

1982, this case was

4

restored to the calendar for reargument to consider the

5

additional question: whether the exclusionary rule as

6

enunciated in Mapp and Weeks should to any extent be

7

modified so, for example, not to require the exclusion

8

of evidence obtained in the reasonable belief that the

9

search and seizure was consistent with the Fourth

20

Amendmen t.
We are back before the Court today to consider

2
22

this additional important issue.
Before I started my argument I would simply

23
24

like to indicate that our argument in a nut shell is

25

this:

1

Determinations of probable cause are

2

practical, factual judgments of probability.

3

function of the magistrate or the judge to make

4

decisions prior to a search.

5

nature of this determination, because of the respect for

6

the magistrate's function in this regard, and because of

7

society's interest in avoiding the exclusionary rule's

8

harsh costs, these determinations should be given great

9

deference on motions to suppress.

10

It is the

Because of the factual

Evidence should not be excluded if any

11

reasonable person could have concluded that there was

12

probable cause on the basis of the totality of the

13

circumstances and judged by the practical and factual

14

considerations of everyday life.

15

In short, if there's a reasonable basis for

16

the finding of probable cause the exclusionary rules

17

should not apply.

18

Any analysis of the exclusionary rule, we

19

believe, must consider the context in which the

20

exclusionary rule was born.

21

Around the turn of the century there was a

22

great concern about flagrant and egregious police

23

misconduct.

24
25

In cases like Weeks in

1914 and Silverthorne

Lumber Company in 1920, you had situations where persons

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

were arrested and while they were in custody the police

2

went to their homes or went to their businesses and

3

searched without probable cause of any sort and without

4

warrants.

5

papers and effects evidence that was used against them.

6

And obtained through their appropriated

In Sochin versus California in

1952, this

7

Court’s conscience was shocked when the police took Mr.

8

Rochin to the hospital and had his stomach pumped in

9

order to obtain the morphine capsules which he had

10

swallowed after the police had forced their way into his

11

house without a warrant.

12

And, finally, in Mapp versus Ohio in

1961

13

which reversed Wolf versus Colorado, of course, and

14

applied the exclusionary rule to the states, you had a

15

situation where the police attempted to enter Mrs.

16

Mapp's house with her consent.

17

attorney she refused that consent.

18

hours later forced their way into the house, searched

19

the entire premises and found four pamphlets and a few

20

photographs, all allegedly pornographic.

21

Upon the advice of her
The police a few

Each of these cases which ultimately led up to

22

Weeks — lead up to Mapp, involved flagrant acts of

23

police misconduct for which this Court indicated the

24

exclusionary rule ought to apply.

25

But the exclusionary rule which was meant to

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

deter such serious misconduct by police has come to mean

2

much more as it's been applied by trial courts and

3

review in courts around this country.

4

The new rule — the rule now applies to

5

evidence — to exclude evidence at trial no matter what

6

the error, large or small, committed by police and by

7

magistrates.

8
9

Now, if the primary intent of the exclusionary
rule is meant to deter police misconduct — and this

10

Court has said that on may occasions starting with

11

Elkins in 1960 — then the world simply does not work in

12

a situation as here where it’s hard to see what the

13

police did wrong.

14

We argued in our initial briefs that we didn't

15

believe the Aguilar-Spinelli two-prong test even if

16

applicable to our case was violated because of the

17

extensive corroboration of the letter and because of the

18

determination of probable cause made by Judge Lewis when

19

he issued the search warrant.

20

But even if this Court were to find that the

21

Aguilar-Spinelli test was violated, we would

22

nevertheless contend that in this instance the

23

exclusionary rule should not be applied because the

24

anonymous letter coupled with ample corroboration

25

amounted to probable cause under the definition as

1

historically enunciated by this Court.
QUESTION;

2
3

Did you argue this before the

Illinois Courts, Mr. Biebel?
MR. BIEBEL:

4

What was argued before the

5

Illinois Courts was the Aguilar-Spinelli standard, Your

6

Honor.

7

Aguilar-Spinelli standard was met.

And we argued that in that instance the

MR. BIEBEL:

10

The exclusionary rule is really

11

here for the first time, Your Honor.

It was not

12

mentioned in oral argument the first time before this

3

Court.

4

sense we were focusing in an indirect fashion on the

5

consideration of probable cause.

6

We were focusing in on Aguilar-Spinelli but in a

What we are doing in our approach today is

7

looking at that probable cause aspect of this case in a

8

closer way.

9

QUESTION:

In general while you are talking

20

about what happened to Lowe, the brief of your opponent

21

suggests that the Constitution of Illinois has an

22

exclusionary rule and that this case was decided on the

23

basis of it.

24
25

That might come first, logically.

MR. BIEBEL:

Your Honor, there is no doubt

that the Supreme Court of Illinois established the

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

exclusionary rule in 1923 in People versus Brocamp.
QUESTION;

That was even before Wolf in

MB. BIEBEL;
Wolf.

6

QUESTION;

7

MR. BIEBEL;

8
9

Yes, it was after Weeks, before

And certainly long before Mapp?
Long before Happ, Your Honor.

That's correct.
But, this Court has defined that rule in

10

People versus Demorrow in 1974 to follow the standards

11

enunciated by the Supreme Court of the United States.

12

The analysis that was made in this case, as a

13

matter of fact, in the Aguilar-Spinelli issue, took into

14

consideration the federal guidelines that took place.

15

So, Illinois does track the Federal Fourth Amendement

16

law with regard to the exclusionary rule and follow --

17

has followed it closely.

18

consistent with whatever the Court would do today.

19

We believe that that is

There's no doubt that the law of search and

20

siezure has become complicated and confusing.

21

of the more confusing areas involves the application of

22

the Aguilar-Spinelli standard.

23

pages in his treatise on hearsay evidence with regard to

24

this problem.

25

And one

Professor Lafate has 140

Because it was confusing we have cases like

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

People versus Bell where a district court held that the

2

affidavit with regard to an eyewitness identification

3

didn’t support the credibility and reliability of that

4

eyewitness in case -- and consequently that evidence was

5

suppressed.

6

that Aguilar-SpiDelli ought to be limited to informant

7

situations.

The Fifth Circuit said that’s simply wrong,

In our case, too, we have an obvious confusion

8

with regard to Aguilar-Spinelli because both the police
10

and the judge felt that the letter could be utilized in

11

order to determine whether probable cause exists or not.
To hold in this case that the exclusionary

12
13

rule applies where the police made a diligent and a

14

reasonable effort to fulfill their responsibilities is

15

in effect to place form over substance.

16

the analysis of whether the search warrant should issue

17

is whether or not there’s probable cause.

The essence and

All three Illinois Courts considering this

18
19

issue talked in terms of probable cause but they

20

analyzed it in light of the two-pronged Aguilar-Spinelli

21

test which we discussed the last time we were before

22

this Court.
However, we suggest in this case that this

23
24

Court ought to consider stating affirmatively that

25

they’re going to return to the unadorned probable cause

Standard which was enunciated in Carroll and in Brinegar
In Brinegar, this Court stated that when

2
3

you're dealing with probable cause you're dealing with

4

probabilities.

5

They are factual and practical concerns of everyday life

6

in which reasonable and prudent men, and not legal

7

technicians, act.
Put in another light, this concept of probable

8
9

These are not technical considerations.

cause merely requires an objectively reasonable

10

assessment that it's more probable than not that the

11

search warrant covered evidence of the crime.
This basic probable cause standard is a

12
13

realization that police and magistrates deal in factual

14

contexts in which they simply don’t have all the

15

answers, but nevertheless may be required to act if they

16

believe there's probable cause.
Mr. Justice White put it well in his dissent

17
18

in Stone versus Powell where he said, making arrests in

19

circumstances in which the police officer feels he has

20

probable cause is precisely what the community expects

21

of him.

22

warrants need delay until unquestioned proof is

23

accumulated.

24

does so.

25

Neither police officers nor judges issuing

The officer may be shirking his duty if he

6

Have you unhooked from Draper?

MR. BIEBEL:

No, we haven't unhooked from

Draper at all.

We certainly discussed Draper at length

the last time, Your Honor.

And we feel that the Draper

QUESTION:

16

We think that

Do you contend, Mr. Biebel, that

17

you can look at any circumstances after the warrant

18

issued ?
MR. BIEBEL:

19

We believe the probable cause

20

determination is made by the circumstances which were

21

given to the magistrate, or in our instance, the judge

22

at the time he considers whether or not to issue a

23

warrant.

24
25

QUESTION:

So, then, in this case the fact

that the car came back to Chicago after the warrant was

All you knew was that it left

Florida, actually.

12

MR. BIEBELs

That's right.

13

And, due to the facts and circumstances you

14

had at the time, we believed that there was enough

15

evidence to indicate.

16

QUESTION;

So, whatever information the police

17

obtained after the warrant was issued you do not ask us

18

to consider, that's all I'm asking.

19

MR. BIEBEL;

That's right.

20

We believe that probable cause is established

21

on the basis of what they knew when the judge issued the

22

search warrant.

23

Since probable cause means only a probability

24

and not unquestioned proof, and, since many situations

25

which confront police officers are more or less

Within the — within the standard

that we are talking about here, it could be argued and

14

We would

And do you contend that the Court,

15

if it reaches the question here of the good faith

16

exception, should focus in on some good faith exception

17

of the magistrate?
MR. BIEDEL;

18

We're saying that our position is

19

somewhat different than the solicitor's in this regard.

20

And what we’re saying is that within the context of

21

cases like this that we're talking about which are

22

basically factual cases.

23

broader scope which, of course, his role as amicus would

24

do.

25

The solicitors is talking in a

We're saying within the factual circumstances

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that we have here, we think that the analysis ought to

2

be back to a totality of the circumstances analysis.

3

And the review of that should be a reasonable basis

4

review.
QUESTION;

5

Well, if -- if that’s your position

6

I'm surprised that you answered Justice Steven’s

7

question the way you did.

8

totality of the circumstances, reasonable basis, I would

9

think that a far less sweeping change then you’re urging

T

If you're talking about

10

would simply be to say that the police may consider,

11

after developing facts, that when — between the time of

12

the issuance of the warrant and the search or siezure

13

that might not have been available to the magistrate.
MR. BIEDEL;

14

I think — I think your point is

15

well taken.

I think the law as it stands now would seem

16

to indicate that the facts and circumstances have to be

17

that which leads up to the issuance of the warrant but

18

certainly if you look at the facts and circumstances in

19

our case it would certainly indicate that a round trip

20

-- a non-stop trip from Florida occurred in those, you

21

know, a great deal found in the car.
So, facts and circumstances certainly would

22
23

lend support to the finding of probable cause that Judge

24

Lewis made in this case when he issued the search

25

warrants.

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

We're saying that even though there may have

1

2

been a mistake, that that shouldn't make any difference

3

in this case.
If you take the case of People versus Hill

4
5

which was cited by this Court in 1971 you had exactly

6

that situation.

7

and they arrested a man that resembled Hill.

8

his name was Millar.

9

police didn't believe him.

The police went to Mr. Hill's apartment
He said

He showed identification.

The

He said he didn't know

10

anything about weapons. There appeared to be a gun in

11

the house.

12

Hill, searched the apartment. It was prior to Schimel,

13

and, consequently, was a proper search.

14

evidence indicative of the guilt of Hill.

They arrested Miller who they thought was

And, they found

15

This Court said that even though there had

16

been a mistake as to who had been arrested there was

17

nevertheless probable cause because the police

18

reasonably believed that the man arrested was Hill.

19

The Court cited Brinegar's standard, and, said

20

that what we 're looking at here is a factual and

21

practical rather than a legal technical view — legally

22

technical view, and, consequently, that mistake

23

shouldn't make any difference in the finding of probable

24

cause which is actually the determination of

25

probabilities.

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Because this is a practical consideration, the

2

issuance of a warrant is entitled to great deference as

3

this Court has stated in cases such as Jones and

4

Ven tresca.
And, consequently, since there is deference

5
6

paid to the Court the review of the finding of probable

7

cause is in effect a review of the finding of fact, and,

8

therefore, should be reviewed on a reasonable basis

9

standard rather than demobile review as you would have

10

with questions of law.
This, we would observe is the same basic

11
12

standard that courts use in determining whether or not

13

probable cause exists on appeal.
QUESTION;

14

As this Court --

Counsel, if the purpose of the

15

exclusionary rule was, as you suggested earlier in your

16

remarks, deterrence of improper police conduct, then how

17

does application of a good faith exception to a

18

magistrate's decision in issuing the warrant further the

19

deterrence of the police?
MR. BIEDELs

20

What we're basically saying,

21

here, is that in these cases the deterrence, yes, but,

22

comes in this way, if it may please the Court, that the

23

police activity in this case was reasonable.

24

thorough.

25

It was

It was done over a short period of time.
That is basically the deterrence -- I'm sorry,

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the good faith aspect of this case is basically what the

2

solicitor is putting forward.

3

these types of cases that what we've got to look at is

4

the factual context in which the probable cause finding

5

is made, and if there's a reasonable basis for it.

6

What we're saying is in

And many cases, I might add, involved this

7

exact question on motions to suppress, was the evidence

8

sufficient to show probable cause.

9

What we're saying is that even though we're

10

asking the Court to mutilate what it said before, we

11

think the laws become confused in this area.

12

think the Court ought to clearly establish what the role

13

of probable cause is in search warrants, what the

14

standard is, and what the role of — what the basis of

15

review ought to be.

16

And we

If that's the case, then, a lot of these

17

aberrant decisions which have come down in the search

18

and siezure area I think would be changed if those

19

considerations were made in light of the standard we're

20

asking the Court to enunciate in this case.

21

Getting back.

The standard in criminal cases

22

is not whether the reviewing Court feels that the

23

defendent is proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,

24

but, rather where there was substantial evidence to show

25

that as this Court pointed out in Woodby versus the

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

Immigration and Naturalization Service in 1966.
And, in 1979, this was reiterated in Jackson

3

versus Virginia.

Hr. Justice Stewert issued the opinion

4

in that case in somewhat different language where he

5

said, the issue was whether any rational tryer of fact

6

could have determined guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

7

Using that basic phylosophy of deference for

8

the factfinder, we apply that to this case involving

9

probable cause.

10

This Court said, for example, in Jones versus

11

Uni ted States in 1960 that the standard of review with

12

regard to.probable cause is whe ther the re is a

13

substantial basis to believe that the narcotics were

14

probably present in the apartment.

15

Now, by using the substantial or reasonable or

16

rational basis the focus becomes not what the reviewing

17

judge thought, but what a reasonable, a rational police

18

officer or magistrate could have believed when he made

19

the determination of probable cause.

20
21

22

And if that determination is probable, it
ought to be respected by the Court.
QUESTION:

Haven’t a number of cases added

23

HR. EIEDEL:

That's right, police officers are

They obviously are professionals in

2

what they do and that’s different from what we all do.

3

And, we think that what they’ve learned in experience in

5

they believe there's probable cause which exists in

these cases.

Nathanson case in which the officer was confident that

9

there was probable cause, but the magistrate disagreed

11

conclusions was enough.

12

to reexamine that case?
MR. BIEDEL;

13

Would you -- are you asking us

needs reexamination, Your Honor, because all it was was

a conclusory statement of probable cause.

evidence, facts and all the supporting evidence to the

words, that the good faith of the police officer is

I don't think the subjective

police officer's good faith is enough, that's correct.
Michigan versus Tucker declared that the

consequently, you can’t require police officers to make

9

no mistakes whatsoever.

And,

The pressures of law

enforcement simply don't permit that kind of expectation.
Importantly, I would point out that Michigan

12

versus Tucker also talked about the deterrence rationale

13

of the exclusionary rule and assumed the police acted in

14

willful or at least negligent ways when the -- when this

rule is to apply.

of the police officer in that case, that is the absence

of any malice, then we would say the rule shouldn't

apply.

When this deterrent rationale we've talked

19

20

about here is considered in conjunction with the

21

reviewing standard that we've said that probable cause

22

ought to have, we find that it's clear in this case that

23

the motion to suppress should not have been granted in

24

this case.

25

First of all, there's no evidence whatsoever

to deter.

QUESTION*

Was there any inquiry under that

aspect in the Court below?

MR. BIEBEL*

There wasn't any inquiry, Judge.

I think that in reading the record that we see we can

find that is a conclusion that can reasonably be drawn.

Their actions in this case, I think, can only

be characterized as thorough and professional.

The the imposition of the exclusionary rule in

And, certainly deter police officers from

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.

17

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

18

MR. LEEf

19
20

Hr. Solicitor General.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court.
This Court *s question as stated in its order

21
22

of November 29, is keyed to the officers' reasonable

23

belief.

24

this Court's precedents which make it quite clear that

25

the exclusionary rule necessarily applies only where,

As so stated the question has been answered by

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and, I'm quoting from Michigan versus Tucker, the police

2

have engaged in willful or at the very least negligent

3

conduct.
It is elementary law that the willful and the

4
5

negligent occupy different parts of the legal and

6

behavorial universe from that which is reasonable.

7

that by very definition the question has been answered

8

by this Court's decisions.

So

The conduct of a law enforcement officer in

9
10

Weeks and Mapp as Mr. Biebel has told us was flagrantly

11

abusive.

12

intentional it was susceptible of being deterred.

13

It was intentional.

Because it was

The present case is at the opposite end of the

14

spectrum from Weeks and Mapp.

15

conduct in this case was not flagrant.

16

intentional.

17

technically violative of the Fourth Amendment involves

18

only disagreements among judges over subtle and elusive

19

issues of law.

20

which the exclusionary rule was intended to apply or

21

which achieves its deterrence objectives.

22

The police officers*
It was not

It is the kind of conduct which even if

This is simply not the kind of case to

And under those circumstances this case is

23

controlled by a firmly established principle,

24

established by this Court in a consistant line of

25

decisions reaching back for at least fourteen years

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

which teaches that since the paramount and probably the

2

sole purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter

3

unlawful police conduct, the rule applies only to those

4

situations where its deterrence benefits outwiegh the

5

costs of suppressing highly probative evidence.

6

This Court's precedents reject the notion that

7

the exclusionary rule applies to any violation of the

8

Fourth Amendment or that it must be applied whenever

9

there is any possibility of deterrence however slight.

10

The answer, the Court said in Stone versus

11

Powell, is to be found by weighing the utility of the

12

exclusionary rule against the costs of extending it.

13

Now, let's apply that task.

14

QUESTION;

15

ask one question.

16

case.

Hr. Solicitor General,

let me just

Your brief doesn't cite the Nathanson

17

MR. LEE; No.

18

QUESTION;

How do you put that into your

19/ scheme of things.
20

HR. LEE;

Under our scheme, once a warrant has

21

been obtained, if the warrant had been issued in that

22

case, then in all except the most unusual of

23

circumstances, and we do hold open the possibility that

24

there could be some unusual circumstance, that should be

25

a virtual categorical reasonable kind of police type

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

conduct, and therefore, one to which the reasonable

2

belief modification would apply.
Now, in the event that the warrant did not

3
4

issue, not in that case, then you would have to judge it

5

under the more rule of reason type approach to ask

6

whether there was or was not a reasonable belief.

7

QUESTION:

8

Do you say we should overrule the Nathanson

9

case or follow it?

10

HR. LEE;

11

I think it should be followed in the

circumstance.
QUESTION:

12

13

I must confess, I*m not clear.

Even though there was — I don't

quite understand why.
HR. LEE;

14

Well, whether there — whether this

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Because there was no misconduct, no

negligence or willfulness there.
MR. LEE:

18

No.

In the event that the Court

19

would conclude that the conduct of the police was

20

reasonable, and I think it very likely that the conduct

21

was reasonable in that case, then the modification

22

should apply.
QUESTION:

23
24
25

In other words we should overrule

the case?
HR. LEE:

That is right.

Not as rationale,

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

but, it's -- the actual holding of the case.

2

QUESTIONi

3

should decide it differently.

4

MR. LEE:

5

QUESTION:

If the same facts arose again we

That's right.
What happened in Nathanson?

6

the police officer go to a magistrate and the

7

magisterate turned him down?

8

MR. LEE:

9

Did

That's my recollection is that they

did not get the warrant in that case.

10

QUESTION:

Then they did get the warrant in

11

the Nathanson case.

12

QUESTION:

They did get a warrant?

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Lee, what happens under your

15

approach in this case to improper determinations, even

16

flagrant ones, by the magistrate?

17

MR. LEE:

18

QUESTION:

Let me address that question —
Determanations that are completely

19

wrong and unsupportable.

20

be perfectly all right for the police officer to take

21

such a warrant and follow it.
MR. LEE:

22
23

Justice O'Connor.

24

respect.

25

Now under your view, it would

Not necessarily perfectly all right,
Let me make two comments in that

One is that the principal focus should be on

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the conduct of the police rather than on the conduct of

2

the magistrate for two reasons.

3

The first is that insofar as deterrence is

4

concerned this Court's decisions have made it rather

5

clear that it is the police officers with whose conduct

6

we are to be concerned.

7

QUESTION:

On the assumption —

So there is a secondary interest in

8

making sure the government itself isn't involved in

9

wrongdoing.

10

MR. LEE:

That is correct.

That is correct.

11

And for that reason as we set forth in our

12

brief, we hold open the possibility that in some future

13

case there could be conduct in which it — not only the

14

conduct of the police, but also that of the magistrate

15

might be taken into account in determining whether the

16

totality of governmental conduct, both police and

17

magistrates, might result in the modification which we

18

urge not being applicable.

19

But those would be unusual circumstances for

20

this reason.

On the assumption which underlies

21

necessarily the exclusionary rule that there is a

22

linkage between the deterrence of the police and the

23

unavailability of the use of the evidence at the trial,

24

there is at least a logical linkage because the police

25

are part of, in one view, the overall law enforcement

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

effort.

The linkage is much more loose and indeed there

2

is some question as to whether it even exists when you

3

focus not on the law enforcement officer hut rather on

4

the magistrate.

5

The magistrate's responsibility is not to

6

convict.

The magistrate's responsibility is — he is

7

not part of the overall law enforcement process.

8

his responsibility improves the accommodation of both

9

society's interests and also the individual's

Rather

10

interests.

11

that the deterrence of the magistrate fits in the same

12

category as does deterrence of the police.

13

And as a consequence, it simply is not true

I'd like now to turn to the application of

14

this Court's truth suppression balancing against

15

deterrence of improper police conduct to the facts in

16

this case.
First of all on the cost side, hr. and Mrs.

17
18

Gates were indicted on the charge of possession of

19

marijuana.

20

that is rather relevant to whether they are guilty.

21

Illinois has some evidence in its possession

The Illinois police in executing the search

22

warrant found 350 pounds of marijuana in the Gates'

23

trunk and more incriminating evidence in their home.

24
25

The only question is whether this highly
relevant and probitive evidence is to be kept from the

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

jury.

Surely judicial integrity suffers serious damage

2

when facts known to the judge, the lawyers on both sides

3

and to the defendent are withheld solely from the only

4

participants in the courtroom who need it the most.
On the deterrent side of the scale assuming

5
6

arguendo that the drugs and other items were received in

7

violations of the Fourth Amendment, it is difficult to

8

perceive any adequate deterrent effect on future police

9

misconduct from suppressing this evidence.
The reason is that the police did in this case

10
11

exactly what any reasonable police officers should do,

12

what our society wants them to do and what this Court

13

has said on many occasions that they should do wherever

14

possible.

15

They obtained a search warrant so that the

16

probable cause judgment is made by one whose

17

governmental obligation includes the protection of the

18

constitutional rights of the individual.

19

QUESTION:

General Lee, are there any

20

statistics showing by what percentage of times a

21

magistrate turns down a request for a search warrant?

22

KR. LEE:

23

not aware of them.

24
25

If there are, Justice Sehnquist, I'm

Consider if you will, the course which the
present law requires the policeman to steer when he is

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

operating as he usually is within that indistinct Fourth

2

Amendment boundary between the lawful and the unlawful.

3

On the one hand we require him not to be too

4

aggressive and very properly so lest individual Fourth

5

Amendment rights not be violated.
It is equally important however that he not be

6
7

overly timid lest criminal activity go unpunished,

8

undetected, or worst of all, unprevented.
That kind of obligation to steer between the

9
10

scylla of his law enforcement obligation and the

11

charybdis of the Fourth Amendment is probably

12

unavoidable.

13

consequence that we impose on him if by hindsight we

14

discover that he has made even the slightest technical

15

deviation from the perfect course.

But what is not unavoidable is the

If we turn our backs on the evidence that he

16
17

has obtained just because he has not been successful in

18

forecasting judicial decisions, then that is not only

19

freeing the criminal because the constable has

20

blundered.

within this Court's decisions, at least a dozen of them,

dilemma that the police officer faces.

QUESTION:

is that even though there is no probable cause here the

warrant should stand.

7

MR. LEE:

That brings me to another question

8

that I do want to discuss.

And that is, in appropriate

9

instances where the reasonable belief modification might

10

be dispositive of the particular case, but nonetheless,

11

the reviewing court might conclude that it is

12

appropriate to review, to not go immediately to the

13

reasonable belief modification issue but rather consider

14

first the substantive Fourth Amendment issue, either the

15

propriety of the warrant or the meaning of the Fourth

Amendment in that context.

10

That decision is People v. Smithers at 394 Northeast

11

2nd, 590, in 1979, Illinois public case.

12

Petitioner urges this Court to adopt the

13

standard such that if the issuing magistrate made a

14

mistake in his determination of probable cause, the

15

evidence siezed pursuant to the warrant should

16

nevertheless be admissable.

17

Petitioner is thus requesting this Court, not

18

the Illinois Supreme Court when they argued there, to

19

ignore the Illinois Constitution, to ignore the Illinois

20

Statute and to ignore the Illinois Supreme Court's

21

opinion in Brocamp 60 years ago.

22

Further, petitioner's suggestion that search

23

warrants deficient on their face should not be

24

overturned flies in the face of this Court's language in

Do you agree, Nr. Eeilley, that a

presumptively valid?

9

10

that evidence siezed without probable cause be excluded

based upon the constitutional language which tracks the

12

Fourth Amendment, the statu tory language and the

decisions.

14

In summary, any modification of the rule can

15

have no effect on the Illinois constitutionally

16

judicially declared and legislatively enacted

exclusionary rule.

18

This Court in Cooper v. California made the

19

statement which I feel is appropriate with regard to

20

this state ground argument.

higher standards on searches and siezures than required

by the Federal Constitution if it chooses to do so.

And

I believe the language is appropriate to

The substance of the state's argument on

8
9

appeal is that Judge Stiegment's finding that probable

10

cause to issue the warrant did not exist, was merely a

11

substitution of his views for the findings previously

12

made by Judge Munsch in issuing the warrant.
The state would have us rule that once a

13
14

magistrate issues a

search warrant which he finds to be

15

based on probable cause another trial judge may not

16

overturn that decision in ruling on a motion to suppress.
The Illinois appellant court stated then,

17

we

18

cannot agree with the state's argument.

Such a holding

19

would immunize the reexamination of the warrant process

20

and determine the ruling upon a motion to suppress.
Counsel never urged that in the Illinois

22

courts.

He's now urging this Court perhaps to overrule

I believe it's important now to direct certain
comments to that issue.
The Fourth Amendment talks about
reasonableness.
The Fourth Amendment has a warrant clause

18

which specifically requires that probable cause be the

19

standard, that the warrant be signed by a neutral and

20

detached magistrate, and that there be specificity in

21

the warrant.

22

By definition, a search warrant issued upon

23

less than probable cause is per say unreasonable under

24

the Fourth Amendment.

25

To permit the introduction of evidence seized

50

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

pursuant to an officer's inaccurate reasonable belief

2

that he acted in compliance with the Fourth Amendment

3

would establish a lesser standard than probable cause,

4

best described as we did in our brief a reasonably

5

unreasonable search.
The Fourth Amendment standard of probable

6
7

cause would become diluted and in effect would become

8

whatever the officer thought it was.
Dunnaway v. New York spoke to the question of

9

10

probable cause and indicated there was a long history of

11

testing the standard of probable cause against the

12

standard of reasonableness as required by the Fourth

13

Amendment.

14

Dunnaway also said that the exclusionary rules

15

should be based upon an objective rather than a

16

subjective test.

17

is reasonableness.

18

The key part of the warrant I believe

It makes no sense to ask that an exception to

19

the rule be adopted when the word reasonableness is

20

already included in the Fourth Amendment.

21

And this Court has, with regard again to the

22

warrant process, has dealt with the question of

23

reasonableness in cases such as Ventresca in which the

24

Court will give more credence to a judge's determination

25

which has been upheld upon review in lower courts.

probable cause without a warrant.
And, yet, under the rule that you're

2
3

advocating and I think many of the court's decisions

4

undoubtly support you the -- if a police officer goes

5

and gets a warrant he has to put in black and white once

6

and for all his view of what facts amounts to a probable

7

cause.

8
9

And it's very easy to simply review it as the
moment it was presented to the magistrate.

But if he

10

simply goes out on a basis of probable cause, it's a

11

much more fluid situation where he can come into court

12

two weeks later and testify what he thought was probable

13

cause, and perhaps put a better face on the evidence

14

that he has.

15

MR. EEILLEY;

Well, this Court's statements as

16

you indicated, Mr. Justice, is that there is a

17

preference for search warrants.

18

preference for the police officer to take whatever facts

19

unless one of the exceptions applies, for example, in an

20

emergency or exigent circumstances,

21

a magistrate, have the magistrate review them in a

22

neutral and detached fashion to determine whether or not

23

the officer is correct in his opinion at that time.

24
25

That there is a

And I believe -- and, of course, the
statements of the officer are then memorialized on the

I agree that sometimes warrants may not be

3

necessary, but this Court has already set out and

5

delineated several exceptions to the warrant requirement

which do not apply in a circumstance such as this where

MR. REILLEY;

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. REILLEY:

Yes, I have. Yes, sir.

Does it happen often in Illinois?
It has happened in my experience

21

on several occasions when I myself was a prosecutor

22

about 12 years ago.

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Do you remember what sort of rate

of acceptance you had -MR. PEILLEY:

Well, at that time I think there

was a learning process of the standards of Aguilar and

Spinelli going on in Cook county.

learning process developed a little further the rate

became less and less because everyone was kind of

learning together, how to apply it in the narcotics

familiar with the standards of this Court.

And once that

So yes, there was that degree of

I believe that counsel's argument in terms of

9

10

this search warrant is asking the Court totally to

11

overlook what you said in Aguilar and Spinelli.
And they argued the first time that this Court

12
13

should overrule those standards.

14

that if the magistrate makes a reasonable mistake and

15

signs the warrant, but his mistake was reasonable, then

16

the warrant should be good.

But

56

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

more than hearsay, you're using a letter, the substance

2

of which is contained -- the police officers do not know

3

who the writer is.

4

5

can establish the reliability of that informant by

6

various statments about his past conduct.

8

To what extent did the subsequent

events bear out the accuracy of the anonymous letter?
MR. REILLEYj

10

The normal affidavit for a search

By subsequent to the search

warrant being signed?
The only thing that happened subsequent, if I

11
12

recall correctly, is that once the car left West Palm

13

Beach, Florida, and started heading in a northerly

14

direction, the only other event that took place was that

15

23 hours later the car pulled up on the driveway.
There was nothing else observed by the

16
17

police.

They ended their surveillance in Florida and

18

did nothing until the car actually arrived.

19

nothing else that was done.

There was

I assume Your Honor is not referring to the

20
21

fact that they stopped them and then they opened the

22

trunk and found the marijuana.

23

happened, but that was long after the warrant was

24

signed.

25

before and we argued in the Supreme Court of Illinois

That, of course,

But there are no other events and we argued

57
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that the activities that they observed were innocent.

2

As a matter of fact, not consistent with the letter.
The letter writer said that Susan Gates would

3
4

drop the car off and fly back home.

5

it back by himself.

Lance would drive

Well, that did not happen.

And I believe that we discussed the

6
7

possibility of a self-verifying detailed for comparing

8

Draper to this case.

9

critical.

But that particular detail was

That was the area where the marijuana was

10

supposed to have been placed in the trunk and if one

11

would think logically that the letter writer said that

12

Lance would drive it back by himself.

13

writer was wrong.

14

it was totally contradicted by the facts of the case.

Well, the letter

That fact was not verified.

In fact,

So therefore, there was nothing that was done

15
16

after the warrant was signed that would in any way,

17

shape or form add to the credibility or reliability of

18

it.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Peillev?

20

MR. REILLEY;

21

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

This case involves police reliance

on a search

where the police relied on the validity of a statute

MR. REILLEY:

What would you think of a case

Well, this Court has directed to

58

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that question and I fully agree that that would be a

2

different circumstance.

3

QUESTION:

Entirely different.

4

MR. REILLEY;

5

I cite as this Court has discussed in

I feel that --

QUESTION:

Would

appropriate

11

do rely on a statute subsequently held unconstitutional?

12

to modify the exclusionary rule when police

MR. REILLEY:

I believe, this Court has

13

already directed their attention to saying that a

14

policeman acting reasonably on a statute of a state that

15

he was told

was a proper statute by the legislature of

16

that state,

that reversing that decision as to that case

17

is not going to deter police officers, because they're

18

acting in conformance with the law of the state that is

19

established specifically by a statute.

20

this Court has indicated that.

21

And I believe

That makes sense.

However, the legislature was wrong,

22

apparently, if this Court feels that the statute was

23

unconstitutional later.

24

that type of a situation.

25

QUESTION;

I see a difference, however, in

In Stone against "Powell, the Ninth

59

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Circuit Court of Appeals, a habeas case, invalidated the

2

arrest of an individual, I think it was in another

3

state, perhaps Arizona, where the warrant subject to the

4

ordinance upon which the policeman had acted

5

subsequently was declared invalid.
So I take it you would agree that the Ninth

6
7

Circuit Court of Appeals made an error in that case.
MR. REILLEY:

8

9

Well, only based upon this

Court's decision in DeFillippo.

10

QUESTION;

Right.

11

MR. REILLEY:

The petitioner in h is reply

12

bri ef makes reference to a case called On Lee v. the

13

United States regarding the use of inf orma n ts .

14

since we're on that subject I wish to comment on Cn Lee.

And

On Lee dealt with the use of informants as

15
16

witnesses at a trial.

And the question there was

17

whether they should testify.

18

credibililty should the trier of fact give to the

19

testimony of an informant.

20

that case has to the case before this Court.

And if so, what

I don’t know what relevance

Of course we’re talking about informants, but

21

22

we're talking about them in the context of Aguilar and

23

Spinelli, which makes sense when you're reviewing a

24

hearsay statement to determine what seems to be

25

logical.

If the hearsay declarant is a reliable person

60

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that can be believed, and what he says comes from some

2

personal knowledge or comes from hearsay observations or

3

statements by someone else, the On Lee case has nothing

4

to do with that type of credibility.
They say also

5

U. S. v. Matlock, stating that

6

this case applies to a search warrant procedure and

7

judge's decisions to give whatever right he wants to an

8

anonymous letter.
The Matlock Court was dealing with the use of

9
10

hearsay statements at a motion to suppress in a trial

11

Court.

12

be given to an anonymous letter, the source of which is

13

unknown to the police, the magistrate, and everyone else.

14

That again, has nothing to do with the weight to

The recent cases -- getting to the question of

15

the non-application of the rule — in respondent’s

16

opinion, the recent cases of Havens, Janis and Calandra

17

do not support the position of the petitioner and the

18

solicitor general in that the Court had stated in those

19

cases that there was no possible deterrent function that

20

could arise from the lack of use of -- for the use,

21

rather, of unlawfully seized evidence in, for example, a

22

grand jury setting.

23

ft. grand jury setting being totally without an

24

adversary situation; an investigory body, the police

25

officer’s function or the police officer's deterrence

61

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

really not effected by that type of a situation.

2

obviously, if an indictment arises from the grand jury,

3

that evidence could not be used at a trial.

Since,

However, the mere perfunctory function of a

4
5

grand jury to indict and to formally charge someone, the

6

deterrent effect would not be violated.
Similarly in Havens the gentleman who was

7
8

stopped at the airport who denied later at trial that

9

the tee-shirt which was found in his suitcase had the

10

pieces cut out of it which contained the cocaine in his

11

partner's suitcase, when he got up and lied before a

12

jury and said that tee-shirt wasn't his, although it was

13

suppressed in a lower Court, this Court ruled rightly

14

that he should be impeached by that because the fact

15

finding and truth finding process of a trial makes more

16

sense .

17
18
19

Again in Janis the use of suppressed evidence
in a federal civil tax case also makes sense.
And as the Justice asked me. Stone v. Powell,

20

in a habeas review, if the state had given a full and

21

fair hearing to the Fourth Amendment question all the

22

way up the state's highest Court, then there is no need

23

to review it in a habeas corpus proceeding.

24

does not destroy the deterrent function.

25

That again

I distinguish in the brief, and I say again

62

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that the cases such as U. S. v. Williams, which everyone

2

seems to be relying on to ask this Court to adopt an

3

exception, can be distinguished totally — again a

4

non-warrant case -- that's the difference.
Williams, the larger majority felt there was

5

6

probable cause in that case.

And it’s understandable if

7

one reads it that the officer who made the arrest, Mr.

8

Marconey, knew the arrestee because he had arrested her

9

bef ore.

And, I believe it was a reasonable mistake a

10

fact and that's what the Court held.

11

believe, he had probable ca use as did the larger

12

majority in the Williams court

13

However, I

•

The Court has already indicated several

14

exceptions to the warrant requirement incident to a

15

valid arrest, plain view cases, auto search cases,

16

inventories, border searches, consent searches, exigent

17

circumstances, and, even, in Terry v. Ohio there was a

18

carved out exception under certain circumstances of

19

articulable suspicion.

20

It seems to us that the petitioner and the

21

solicitor general are asking the Court to carve out

22

another exception to make, if a good faith

23

basis for an admittedly no probable cause warrant, then,

24

what good is the warrant process itself.

2

thought it was.

3

adopt such a standard in light of the language of the

4

Fourth Amendment itself .

I don't believe the Court is going to

As this Court said in the United States v.

5

6

Ross last year, good faith is not enough to constitute

7

probable cause.

8

within the knowledge of the officer which in the

9

judgment of the Court would make his faith reasonable.

That faith must be grounded on facts

It's not just the judgment of the officer.

10

It

11

has to be reviewed because of the ex parte nature of the

12

warrant process itself.

To our defenders of the rule, I believe, the

10

He feels that police are better trained since

then .
He says the result of any exception would be a

11
12

signal to law enforcement to take the forth amendment

13

not so seriously.
I know the Court is familiar with the

14
15

statments of others who have testified before or written

16

letters to the senate subcommittee on the exclusionary

17

rule.

18

general of Maryland says there is much more corporation

between prosecutors and agents of law enforcement as a

20

result of the exclusionary rule.

Steven Saks is another example, the attorney

The bottom line is the prosecutor and the

2

decisions when they know that the exclusionary rule

3

would apply if they did not.

Even Professor Ball, a proponent of good

faith, concedes that the rule has accomplished increased

6

Commissioner Murphy,

after the Mapp decision

said there was a total reconstruction in his police

10

department in New York as a — from the top down to the

11

12

To what weight the Court will give it I do not

13

know, but we cite in our brief a footnote 10A and

14

obviously this as

15

because the quote came in a newspaper shortly before the

16

brief was completed.

17

10A came as an afterthought only

The detective who authored the affidavit in

18

this case was quoted in a Chicago newspaper as saying,

19

if he knew then what he knew now about the exclusionary

20

rule he would have better corroborated the information.

21

This Court need only look to the array of a

22

amici briefs filed in this case on behalf of the

23

petitioner and on behalf of the respondent as evidence

24

of the fact that the rule does in fact deter.

that there is

attention drawn to this only because of the effect of

the exclusionary rule itself, the deterrent function.

10

Perhaps the amici on the petitioners side are
complaining because the rule works too well.

11

If such a modification were adopted, even on

12

an objective rationale, the practical effect in police

13

departments will be that instead of strict compliance

14

with decisions of this Court police will err more in

15

favor of every questionable conduct and not even in

close cases, thus making their own law.
