MR. STEELE*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the CourtsThis case involves the scope and effect of the

11

provisions of the statute which regulates the

12

participation of corporations and labor organizations in

13

the financing of federal election campaigns.

14

The case was brought by the Federal Election

15

Commission against the National Right to Work

16

on the use of general corporate treasury funds.

The district court found that the — under

22 Virginia law, corporations are offered a choice as to
23

whether they wish to become membership corporations or

24

non-membership corporations.

provides that the articles of incorporation must set

2

a non-membership organization it sets that forth, and if

3

you are a membership organization that you’re not.

The National Right to Work Committee organized

itself under these laws, set itself forth in its charter

and in its bylaws and in its formal papers as being an

organization that had no members.

organization.

It’s not a membership

The corporation was also organized under

9
10

501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code as an educational

11

organization involved in combatting what it refers to

12

compulsory unionism.
The district court also found that with regard

13
14

to this organization that its basic method of receiving

15

funds was to rent mailing lists, obtain mailing lists.

16

From these mailing lists they would send out large

17

mailings.

18

firsst item would be an article about compulsory

19

unionism and the viewpoints on it.

20
21

These mailings included several items.

The

Included therein was -- again, the record is
full of examples of these, and in summarizing them,

22 there are some differences.

But the basic format was

23

that there would be an article on the effects of

24

unionism, compulsory unionism, frequently reprinted from

25

a magazine.

With it would be a questionnaire asking

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

questions of the people to whom these mailings went as

2

to whether they agreed with various questions about the

3

effect of these laws, various right to work laws, of

4

various labor laws that were pending in front of the

5

Congress, and there would be a request or a donation, or

6 sometimes called a gift or a contribution to support

the

7

mailing out of these materials, to support in the fight

8

against these particular bills, and would seek funds.
Also, frequently there would be a request to

9

10 engage in

what is called legislative action in the

11

record.

12

therein to send in comments to legislators, and there

13

would often be appeals for that kind of mailings to

14

legislators.

15

Legislative action is taken as a term defined

There was no — as the district court found,

16

there was no reference in any of these materials to

17

membership in the organization, no setting forth of any

18

requirements for membership, no invitation to join in

19

membership; solely, the request for funds.

20
21

There were also several other factors that the
district court looked at.

It looked at the fact that

22 there was nothing set forth as to how these people would
23

terminate their so-called membership.

In this case, the

24

court set forth the determination was something that was

25

solely determined by the National Right to Work

Committee
The court of appeals disturbed none of these

2
3

findings.

In fact# the court of appeals' interpretation

4

and what the Commission believes to be a very important

5

statutory issue was based on the findings, but went to

6

the scope and effect of the basic prohibitions.

7

that scope and effect involve the question of statutory

8

interpretation.

9

in its interpretation, felt that that interpretation was

And

It's clear that the court of appeals,

10

illuminated certainly by constitutional considerations,

11

which it certainly is, but basically was a question of

12

the scope of the statutory history.

13

To review that statutory history, I would note

14

first that under the Federal Election Campaign Act there

15

are two forms, two basic provisions.

16

441b, which was the former U.S. 610, governs

17

corporations and labor organizations.

18

general provisions first enacted in 1971 governing

19

political committees as a whole and their operation.

One, Provision

There are other

20

And as we have noted in our brief, we think

21

that this structure was reviewed by this Court in the

22 California Medical Association case two terms ago, and
23

that basically, what was set forth there is that

24

Congress, in attempting to legislate for the purpose of

25

controlling the effect on the electoral process, is

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

entitled to make certain kinds of judgments.
The basic judgment that Congress made long,

2

3 long ago was that corporations — and then in 1947

labor

4 organizations — presented a different case; a special
5 case,

a greater danger to the electoral process.

6

Consequently, the initial actions of the Congress in

7

1907 were to ban totally contributions by corporations.
Through a process which I know this Court is

8

9 familiar with and which,
10 take me a long
11

that.

as a matter of history, would

time to recite, there was an expansion of

In 1947 Congress, feeling that the definition of

12 contributions had allowed certain expenditures to be
13 made which

were, for all practical purposes, the same as

14 contributions, broadened the definition to include
15 expenditures.

But basically, corporations and labor

16

17 organizations were regulated by

a statute which

18 prohibited them generally from making expenditures that
19 would reach

20 public,

outside of them, to affect the general

to affect the general electorals, but were --

21 under the decisions of

this Court and of the Congress in

22 amending the statute -- were permitted to make
23 expenditures for communications
24 most prominently,
25 and

to their members.

And

first by interpretation of this Court

then effectively enacted in 1971 by the Congress,

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 were allowed to establish, maintain and pay for the
2 solicitations to a separate segregated fund, and those
3 solicitations were limited to its members.
4

In effect, what the statute controls is the

5 use of the corporation's funds or the labor
6 organization's funds.
7

Finally, in 1976, in relation to this case,

8 there was an amendment known as the Allen Amendment.
9 When the Congress convened to act on the statute after
10 this Court's decision in Buckley versus Valeo, it
11

inserted several provisions with regard to then 610.

As

12 this Court probably knows, it moved it from the criminal
13 sections of

18 USC to the Title II and turned it to a

14 civil statute.
15

But with regard to this case, they enacted a

16 provision which said that for a membership corporation,
17 the statute if read to bar it from soliciting its

18 members would prohibit it from dealing with those people
19 who basically make up the corporation.

Consequently,

20 Senator Allen proposed and Senator Cannon, who was
21 managing the bill on behalf of the proponents of the
22 bill, agreed that that amendment really corrected a
23 basic deficiency in the statute.
24 deficiency is too strong a

I don't know if

word, but basically, without

25 that amendment, it was a clarifying amendment to make it

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

clear that for those people who were the members of the

2 corporation,
3

solicitation as they would to shareholders.
As we have set forth in our brief, we think

4
5

that they would be allowed to do the same

that the legislative history of that shows that the

6 purpose of Congress there was to deal with members for a
7

membership corporation in much the same way that it had

8 dealt with shareholders for a stock corporation or for
9

members in unions, as the specialized case of membership

10

organizations that the Congress has legislated specially

11

for them.

12

Senator Allen, who was the proponent, spoke of

13

it in those terms; spoke of it as supplying a

14

deficiency, as remedying an omission in the bill that

15

would otherwise not make it clear.

16

The question, then, on which the court of

17

appeals disagreed with the district court and the

18

Commission, was the interpretation of that term, of the

19

membership organization which is incorporated.

20

that the scope and effect of that must be to allow a

21

corporation to solict anyone who has expressed through

It said

22 various means a political affinity with the goals of the
23
24
25

organization.
The court of appeals’ opinion rested on the
feeling that there would be interference with

1 associational rights if such solicitations were not
2 allowed.

As we have indicated in our brief, we consider

3 that the focus of the statute is not on the solicitation
4 but is on the flow of corporation money.
5

The National Right to Work Committee here,

6 having established a separate, segregated fund, is
7 permitted under the statute to pay for all of the costs
8 involved in that fund.

Those involve all of the costs

9 of establishing and maintaining, setting it up,
10 incorporating if it is incorporated.
11 articles for it.

If it's not, the

All of those matters.

QUESTION*

Mr. Steele, I take it from your

13 brief that it’s 441b(4)(C), is it, that contains the
14 exemption that was construed by the court of appeals?
15

MR. STEELE*

16

QUESTION*

17 language of

Yes, it is.
What is the precise operative

441b that would prevent these people from

18 doing what they seek to do if it weren't for the
19 441b(b)(4)(C)?
20

MR. STEELE*

Again, the structure of the

21 statute is that 441b, the prohibition is contained in
22 441b( a).

When you said the citation you said b —

23 there’s a iouble b there.

It’s 441b(b)(4)(C).

The

24 prohibition is set forth in 441b(a).
25

QUESTION*

Well, which line or which clause of

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

(a) sets forth the prohibition against what these people

2 are trying to do?
3

ME. STEELE;

The prohibition is that of making

That has been — within the

provisions of b(b), what has been exempted from that

MR. STEELE:

QUESTION;

So that now the complaint is the

expenditure of this membership corporation or a

22 membership corporation's assets to undertake the
23 solicitation.
24

MR. STEELE;

The solicitation is permitted in

25 the exceptions if it is two member,

so the question

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

revolves around the question of whether they are members

2 or not.

But yes, that is -- the prohibition is against

3 the expenditure by a corporation of funds to solicit the
4 general public, in effect.
QUESTION*

5

And the exception to that

6 prohibition applies only if the solicitation is of

7 members.
8

MB. STEELE*

Yes.

So that the critical

9 question in the court of appeals' decision was what is
10

the definition of members as intended by Congress.

11

what purpose does that serve.

12

no valid purpose there.

And

They felt that there was

Again, the underlying purpose

13 served by that is the use of the corporation's funds for
14 large-scale use in federal elections.

The structure has

15 been designed in that fashion.
16

I would note, as I started to, that there is a

17 separate regulatory scheme for political committees
18 overall, which this Court considered in the California
19 Medical Association case, which limits anyone else to a
20 contribution stated in dollar terms of $5000 to a
21

22

political action committee.
QUESTION*

Mr. Steele, is this the precise

23 language in 441b(a) or for any corporation, whatever, or
24 any labor organization, to make a contribution or
25 expenditure in connection with any election at which a

12

1

presidential and vice — and if not, what is?
MS. STEELE*

3 As I
4

That is the operative language.

say, that operative language was clearly intepreted

throughout the history of the statute, as prohibiting the

5 expenditures out to the general public.
6 case,

In the CIO

this Court was faced with the question of whether

7

that statute could be read or should be read to prohibit

8

expenditures that were made for the purpose of

9 communicating with,

in that case, the members of a labor

10 organization, but by parallel,
11

with the stockholders of

a stock corporation.
So that that phrase, by that interpretation

12

13 and by this Court's interpretation also in Pipefitters,
14

is clearly meant not to allow a corporation to make

15 those kind of expenditures out to the general public;

to

16 solicit broadly for purposes either to get in funds to
17 give to candidates,

or to make expenditures that would

18 tout them on radio or whatever.

QUESTION*

19
20 be
21

Mr. Steele, I suppose there could

less restrictive ways of addressing the problem.

Congress could, for instance, just prohibit the

22 expenditure by the corporation of no more than X number
23 of dollars for the purpose,

could it not, rather than

24 prohibiting any soliciation of its supporters?
25

ME. STEELE*

I think that that could be done.

I think the question would be somewhat

2

restrictive or more restrictive, because if you had a

3

dollar amount that might not reflect the size of the

corporation.

terms, but basically dealt specifically with the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES N. STEELE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS -- Continued

7

MR. STEELE:

If I might pick up where I left

8 off before the lunch break and take advantage of the
9

Chief Justice’s invitation to discuss the Bellotti case,

10

I would like to note first that what is here is a case

11

in which there is not challenged the basic prohibition

12 of 441b on corporate expenditures.
13

The National Right to Work Committee, as a

14

corporation, admits and agrees that it comes under that

15

provision and indeed, takes the benefits of that

16

provision, the ability under that provision to provide

17

for the support of a committee.

19

interpretation of the subsection.

What they challenge is the

Rehnguist, whether my response to you was as helpful as

22 it might have been in discussing —
23

QUESTION:

I can’t answer that now.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. STEELE:

Well, in discussing the

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

prohibitions of the statute, I alluded to the overall

2

provision in 441b(a).

In 441b(4), it starts off with

4 in
5

the subsection.

issue here

That’s at page 59a of the Petition

for Writ of Certiorari.

But 4(a) says except as

6 provided in subparagraphs b, c and d, it shall be
7

unlawful for a corporation, or its separate, segregated

8 fund, to spend monies to solicit contributions to people
9 other than stockholders’

QUESTIONi

10
11

employees.

It seemed to me that 441b(4)(i) was

a good deal closer to a precise proscription than the

12 more — what I thought was the more general language in
13 441b(a).

MR. STEELE*

14

I think that’s correct, and that

15 is really what is at issue in this case,
16 I think

and that's why

by dwelling only on the broad prohibition.

You

17 have here the specific prohibition on a corporation or
18 its separate,

segregated fund, from soliciting

19 contributions to such a fund from

persons other than.

20

(C) is the one that is specifically at issue here,

21

because it says except for b, c and d — and c is the

22 one that goes to membership
23

QUESTION*

—

Do you think

Congress intended to

24 do other than have a paraphrase

in subsection

(4) of the

25 more general language in 441b?

Do you think Congress

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

meant to tighten up that language in subsection (4)?
HR. STEELE;

I think not.

I think that what

3

they did in 1976 was to expand on the class of people

4

that could be solicited, but the language in (4) was

5

itself just spelling out rather than changing anything.

6

In other words, what they spelled out was what the

7

exceptions to the broad prohibition were.

8

Justice White said, I think in 1976, what they did was

9

to expand the class for a new — for membership

And as

10

corporations to allow them to solicit members.

11

prohibition I think was basically the same as it had

12

been prior to that.

13

But the

In any event, with regard to the Bellotti

14

case, I think that there are several distinctions.

I

15

think, as I started to say, most notably not challenged

17

come under the prohibition.

18

almost a case that is like a mirror image of the

19

California Medical Association case where they asserted

20

the right to solicit throughout, broadly through the

21

general public; also asserted the right that a political

22 committee would have to give to many political
23

committees.

But argued to this Court that they should

24

also be allowed to take advantage of the provisions in

25

441b which allow for administrative support.

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

This is somewhat the mirror image.

This is a

2 case in which they are arguing that they should be
3 allowed the restriction, which is the restriction to the
4 class, while still taking advantage of that portion of
5 the statute which allows them to spend the corporate
6 treasury funds to support that fund.

So that you have a

7 situation where they really don’t really contend that
8 the overall statute is unconstitutional.

They contend,

9 for constitutional reasons, that the congressional
10 exception must be broadly construed to allow them to
11

solicit anyone who has a similar political philosophy,

12 in the phrasing of the court of appeals.
13

QUESTION*

Hell, you certainly don’t need to

14 get to the constitutional considerations to pose the

NR. STEELE*

17

QUESTION*

No, you certainly do not.
And would you be here arguing if

18 they had — I think you probably would, but would you be
19 here arguing if

the corporation had said that anybody

20 who — in their initial solicitations they said anybody
21 who gives us
22

$5.00 is a member.

HR. STEELE*

23 have challenged that.
24

QUESTION*

I don't know whether they would
But —
Well, suppose they, in their

25 initial circulation, said anybody who gives us $5.00 is

a member.

And then they wanted to solicited everybody

2 who had given them $5.00.

Solicit them for political

3 contributions.
4

MR. STEELE:

5

QUESTION:

No, I think —
Now, there is a definite

6 intra-organization definition of membership.

MR. STEELE:

7

No, certainly in that sense, if

8 they had an externalized offering —

QUESTION:

9

MR. STEELE:

10

11

You wouldn't be here, right?
I don’t think we would be here if

they had what we would consider a genuine membership

12 structure.

But here, —
QUESTION:

13

Now, they didn’t say that when they

14 initially solicited it, but everybody who gave them
15 anything, they sent a membership card to.

So why not --

16 de facto, at least, didn’t they have a policy of making
17 everybody who gave them any money a member?
MR. STEELE:

18

I don’t think that they did

19 because —
20
21

22

QUESTION:

What do you mean?

Do you challenge

the fact that they sent them a membership card?
MR. STEELE:

They sent them a piece of paper

23 at the end of the year at the end on the renewal saying
24 we want you to renew your membership.
25

QUESTION:

Well, nevertheless, they recognized

thsm as members
MR. STEELE*

2

But when they solicited them,

3

they never told them that they were soliciting them for

4

membership.
QUESTION*

5

6 discovered
7

That may be so.

But they suddenly

that people who gave them — we suddenly

discover we were members.

So this is a policy of the

8 organization.
9

MR. STEELE*

A policy of the organization I

10 think, is a strong statement of it.
11
12

They have then

decided to solicit people who —
QUESTION*

So if they put a little footnote to

13

their initial soliciation, by the way, anybody who gives

14

us money is a member.

15

That would have made all the difference in the world .

16

MR. STEELE*

Just about eight or nine words.

I think that the Commission in

17

its opinions has said that you have, at the very least,

18

to have that.

19

be organized as a membership fund —

20

If you are within a state law you have to

QUESTION*

Well, would you have to have

21 anymore or not?
22

MR. STEELE*

In the Commission's view, you

23

would have to have a voluntary acceptance of that.

24

other words, that you would have to have —

25

QUESTION;

In

Wall, a voluntary acceptance in the

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 sense that if you have that footnote and the guy sends
2 in his money, he has accepted membership.
3

MR. STEELE;

That you not only have to have

4 that — and in a knowing sense, that people know that.
5 And the reason I quibble with that is whether a footnote
6 at the bottom said this makes you a member, as opposed
7 to an invitation, we would like you to join as a member,
8 would raise questions in my mind as to whether the
9 membership was a voluntary, knowing decision.

Because

10 the entire premise of the Commission’s regulations is
11 that there are requirements for membership and that
12 those be made known to those people that come forward.
13

I would add that in addition to that, the

14 Commission feels that there has to be some measure of
15 rights and obligations coming to the members.

That what

16 Congress was here seeking and what the history of the
17 amendment in

1976 says, is that it was a parallel to the

18 shareholder and member definitions for unions and
19 corporations,

and that you have some form of fiduciary

20 relationship; something comparable to the fiduciary
21 relationship there.

That you have some kind of —

22

You don’t suggest that it was

QUESTION;

23 illegal under state law for the corporation to treat
24 these people as members.

25

MR. STEELEs

Not if they organized themselves

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 as a membership corporation.
2

QUESTION*

Well, that isn’t my question.

So I

3 take it you say that they — was it consistent with
4 state law or not, to treat these contributors as members?
5
6 state law.
7

HR. STEELE*

They don't have members under

It would be consistent in the sense that —
QUESTION*

All right.

So it is illegal for

8 them to treat anybody as a member.
9

MR. STEELE*

Well, they would have to give

10 them notice of annual meeting.

They would have to give

11 them, under the Virginia law, they would have to give
12 them the rights of members in a membership organization
13 —
14

QUESTION*

So your answer to my question is

15 under the state law they were not permitted to treat
16 these people as members.
17

MR. STEELE*

Not without constituting

18 themselves a membership organization, which carries with
19 it certain obligations to its members.

20

QUESTION*

And they didn’t.

21

MR. STEELE*

22

QUESTION*

And they did not.
Mr. Steele, I wonder how confident

23 you are of that answer.

Where I practiced — and I have

24 understood it's a fairly doctrine in

the States -- they

25 have the doctrine of de facto corporations.

A bona fide

attempt to incorporate, a certain amount of formalities

2 complied with, and the state would treat you as a
3

corporation.

4

treated these people as a corporation on the basis of

5

what they actually did?
HR. STEELE*

6
7

Do you know that Virginia would not have

No, I do not.

What I was saying

is that under Virginia law, if you have members, you

8 have obligations to them.

QUESTION*

9

And where —

And are you saying you're also

10 obligated

to say that you are a membership organization?

11

MR. STEELE*

That's the third requirement.

12

The articles of incorporation have to say, one, your

13

name; two, your purpose; three, whether you're a

14

membership corporation, and if you're not a membership

15

corporation state that; four, if you are a membership

16

corporation, state that and what classes of membership

17

you will have.

18

that flow from Virginia law; most prominently, notice —

And there are certain other requirements

19

QUESTION*

20

MR. STEELE*

21

22

And what did these articles provide?
These articles provided that they

were not a membership organization.
QUESTION*

Mr. Steele, if your restriction as

23

to membership is agreed to, then I guess we get to the

24

constitutional question, do we?

25

MR. STEELE*

Certainly, the court of appeals

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

seemed to have constitutional questions underlying it

2 that —
3

QUESTION*

But isn't there a constitutional

4

question here on the premise of your interpretation of

5

membership?

6

MB. STEELEs

Well/ I think it’s really a

7

question of — I mean, the constitutional question in

8

the sense that if Congress did make that limitation, is

9

there something that prohibits that.

10
11
12

QUESTIONS

Well, what's the govermental

interest in that limitation?
MB. STEELEs

Well, the governmental interest I

13

think, once again, is in distinguishing between the

14

overall statute where you have a prohibition on

15

corporations with the exceptions in between, that

16

there's an underlying governmental purpose there of

17

controlling the corporation's expenditures, the amounts.

18
19

20
21

QUESTION»

How does this membership

restriction further those interests?
MB. STEELE*

It furthers it in the same way

that — it's a quid pro quo.

It furthers it in the same

22 way that the restriction to shareholders with regard to
23

a stock corporation furthers that law.

It allows the

24

corporation, which Congress wishes to control in a

25

certain way, to communicate with those people that make

25

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

it up, in the terms of the legislation, that make up the

2 corporation.

So it's a parallel and it serves the same

3

restriction.

4

QUESTION!

5

6
7

It deals with the financing by the

Ho less restrictive way of doing it

than this?
MR. STEELEi

Well, in regard to Justice

8 O’Connor's question, it might be less restrictive if
9

Congress said no corporation shall send more than $5000

10

in soliciting anyone, and put them under that

11

restriction that was the one in Calpak.

12

think that Congress has made a balancing here between

13

two types of restrictions, and less restrictive seems to

14

be a conclusion in that sense.

15

the two interests.

16

QUESTION;

But again, I

They have balanced here

Mr. Steele, if we have to reach the

17

constitutional issue, which I would suppose we would if

18

we accept your definition of membership, wouldn't

19

resolving that question almost resolve the

20

constitutionality of the pre-1976 situation with respect

21

to membership corporations?

22

MR. STEELEs

I would think it might.

I'm not

23

sure I follow.

If you reach the constitutional

24

question, the argument would be, it seems to me, that

If you say — and then the question

with respect to membership corporations.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Mr. Mansfield.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD H. MANSFIELD, III, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MANSFIELD*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

22 please the Court;
23

The whole FEC argument in this case is based

24

upon one premise and one assumption, an assumption which

25

only this Court now at this stage has realized and made

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the FEC answer, and that is*

almost every argument that

2 it makes states that the individuals that the National
3

Right to Work Committee solicited in 1976 for

4

contributions to its PAC were not its members.

5

has the FEC looked into and defined what a member is for

Never

6 the terms of the Act.
7

The Act itself, the statute itself and the

8 regulations promulgated under the statute -9
10

QUESTION*

They certainly have taken the

position that these people are not members.

11

MR. MANSFIELD*

12

QUESTION*

13

MR. MANSFIELD*

They do.

So they defined it to that extent.
Only to the extent where on

14

the public record the Federal Election Commission has

15

stated it knows what a membership corporation is.

16
17

QUESTION*

They claim to know that these

people are not members, but in that extent, it's defined.

18

MR. MANSFIELD*

19

QUESTION*

20
21

To that extent it is defined.

Why don't we talk about whether

that’s defensible or not?
MR. MANSFIELD*

22 numerous reasons.

Well, it is not defensible for

The first of which is that the

23

statute, on its face, allows corporations without

24

capital stock — not membership organization, but

25

capital organizations without capital stock — to

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

solicit its members.

The regulation promulgated by the

2 Federal Elaction Commission seems to adopt the
3

definition of a member of the organization itself,

4

except that it does not allow the membership to be

5

premised solely upon contribution to the separate,

6 segregated fund.

Never has the FEC been able to precisely

7

8 define what a member is.
9

However, this Court has

sanctioned the usa of an analysis between or of the

10

relationship between, or nexus between, the organization

11

and the participant in determining membership status.

12

The court of appeals concluded —

it.

You say this Court has sanctioned

In what case?
MR. MANSFIELD*

That’s in the Hunt versus

Washington State Apple Advertising Commission case.
QUESTION*

That really didn't involved federal

election controls.
MR. MANSFIELD*

Not at all.

That case was a

20

case in which the Court was asked to determine whether

21

or not the Washington State Commission had standing

22 before a federal court to prosecute the claims of its
23

members against another state, and this Court said that

24

in order to determine whether or not this was a

25

traditional membership organization, whether it was the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

type of organization which the prior cases had allowed

2 standing, that the Court would look below the organizing
3

documents, below the fact that this was a state

4

organization and look into the nexus between the

5

individuals and the —
QUESTION*

6

But our organizational standing

7

cases have frequently dealt with just groups of people

8

or associations that didn't attempt to have corporate

9

status.

And I would think perhaps when you're talking

10

about a member of an organization like that you might

11

mean one thing; when you’re talking about a member of a

12

corporation, of a non-profit corporation with members,

13

you might be talking about something quite different.
MR. MANSFIELD;

14

I believe that the analysis

15

holds, though.

The analysis that this Court has

16

sanctioned, looking beyond the formal organization into

17

the nexus.

18

did the statute mean, what does the Federal Election

19

Campaign Act mean when it says corporations without

I mean after all, the question here is what

20 capital stock can solicit their members.
21

QUESTION;

I can hardly believe that Congress

22 meant to incorporate the definition that this Court used
23

in Hunt versus Washington State Apple Commission when it

24

was enacting the Federal Campaign Contribution Act.

25

MR. MANSFIELD;

Not at all, but the question

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 faced by those individuals such as the National Right to

3 comply with the statute is when they're deciding what is
4 a member.

They have to look to this Court's prior

5 guidance as to —
6

QUESTION;

I would think before they looked

7 even to this Court's prior guidance they might figure
8 out what they were incorporating under, under the laws
9 of Virginia, and if they get a status that says it has
10 no members, I would think they might feel they were in
11 trouble.
12
13 that.

MR. MANSFIELD;

Well, there are two answers to

The first is that as the court of appeals held,

14 the state definition of member is not likely to reflect
15 the First Amendment rights that are involved in an
16 interpretation of the Federal Election Campaign Act.
17 For example, -18

QUESTION;

19 rather apt,

But wait a minute.

Isn't Congress

when it talks about a corporation and a

20 corporation without member — a not for profit
21 corporation without members in view of the long history
22 of federal refusal to participate in general
23 incorporation, isn’t it apt to be referring to state
24 laws?
25

MR. MANSFIELD;

Not in this case, and I would

QUESTIONS

It is not enough for you to change

That is not what Congress

Your client made that inquiry of

MR. MANSFIELD*

Yes.

And the Commission, as

the court of appeals stated, barricaded itself behind

The offer was made, and

19

the FEC says that’s not enough.

least, according to the FEC —

QUESTION;

What is it now?

Is it a membership

22 corporation or not?
23
24
25

It is, for the purposes of

I'll find it.

To just finish my answer with

respect to the organization documents, the FEC, the

18

Federal Election Commission's interpretation of

19

congressional intent is that regardless of whether or

20

not you're a membership organization under state law,

21

that's enough.

Our position in this case is that —

That might apply to another case,

look at the statute.

Indeed.

And the statute says

some other organizations, and

24 corporations without capital stock can solicit their
25 members.

The statute doesn't say membership

whether organizationally they had members or not.

Well, if there’s nothing in the

position is correct, and if the prohibition on

1 it can use corporate funds but only to solicit its
2 members or people with a nexus between the organization
3 the corporation.
4

QUESTION*

Do you think Med Cal then suggests

5 that these classifications between individual and
6 corporate committees would be — would not run afoul of
7 the equal protection?
8

MR. MANSFIELD*

I am sorry, I couldn't hear

9 the first part.
10

QUESTION;

I say, are you suggesting that Med

11 Cal has said anything to indicate that these
12 classifications would pass muster under the — under an
13 equal attack ?
14

MR.

MANSFIELD; Not directly.

15

QUESTION*

No one suggests that your initial

16 mailing to the public is by any means violates any law.
17

MR.

MANSFIELD* No, not at all.

18

QUESTION*

And so you're free to solicit for

19 membership, as you would like to have it interpreted —
20

MR.

MANSFIELD* Yes.

21

QUESTION*

— the public generally.

The

22 restriction would say that you're not supposed to use
23 the money raised for that kind of a solicitation to
24 finance political solicitations with such funds —
25

MR.

MANSFIELD* With the exception that you

55
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

can use — you can use that money to — to finance

2 political solicitation only if that solicitation goes to
3

your members.

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

5

MR. MANSFIELD:

And, of course, it’s our

6

position that these individuals is a more than

7

sufficient nexus between these individuals to be our

8

members•
QUESTION:

9

But you don’t -- you don’t — if

10

you didn’t claim to be a membership organization, you

11

wouldn't be in here challenging the general restriction

12

on forming these groups.

13

MR. MANSFIELD:

No, because we would then be

14

in the same position, I suppose, as the California

15

Medical Association was.

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

17

QUESTION:

Now, absent knowledge of

18

membership, are there some practical problems lurking

19

here?

20

District Judge and then through seven, eight, or nine

21

Court of Appeal Judges and then here.

This case has come up through a United States

What about some

22 other requirements of knowing whether judges are
23

disqualified?

Suppose the wives of all those judges who

24

dealt with it were members had contributed to this

25

organization, would they be disqualified?

(Pause.)

2

QUESTION*

In other words, in your briefs and

3 the briefs coining here, unlike those in some of the
4 corporate cases, we don’t have a list of members.

He

5 couldn’t have with as many members as you -- as you
6

state that you have.

Does that present a practical

7 problem, the nondisclosure of members?
8

(Pause.)

9

QUESTION*

10

Well, how are judges going to know

whether they’re disqualified under other statutes?
MB. MANSFIELD*

11

12 advocacy organization,

Well, because this is an

Mr. Chief Justice, and not an

13 economic organization.

The — the key to the National

14 Right to Work Committee is people who join it wish to
15 contribute in order to promote a philosophy.

It would

16 be the same, for example, I suppose as a church or any
17 other type of —
QUESTION*

18

Let's make it a little bit closer.

19 Suppose it developed that all these judges were members
20 of
21

22

this organization in the sense that they had sent $5

or ?10 every year.

Would they be disqualified?

MR. MANSFIELD*

Only if they believed — since

23 it’s not an economic relationship, it’s a philosophic
24 relationship, I would believe that they would not be
25 disqualified unless they believed that it would somehow

57
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

prevent them from reaching an equitable decision under

2 the law.

QUESTIONS

3

4 harder than that?

Well, but isn’t it even a little
Am I not correct in understanding

5

that the rights that you seek to vindicate in this

6

litigation are the rights of your members, the rights to

7 receive and to participate in the political process in
8 the manner that you support?

MR. MANSFIELD-s

9

QUESTION:

10

Yes.

Then would it not be true that any

11

individual, such as the Chief Justice suggested, who

12

without .perhaps realizing it is a member under your

13 definition,

he is in effect a party to this litigation?

QUESTIONS

14

Or at least he would appear to some

15 people to have some interest.

The perception is the

16 important thing under the statute.

QUESTIONS

17

It is sort of a class action, in a

18 way .
19

MR. MANSFIELDS

I hadn’t thought of it in

20

those terms precisely, but I suppose that there is

21

justification in that.

22

QUESTION;

23 further, Mr.
24

Very well.

Do you have anything

Steele?

MR. STEELE:

No, Your Honor, unless there are

25 further questions.

Very well.

Thank you,

The case is submitted.
