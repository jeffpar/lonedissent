ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELLIOTT SCHULDER, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

NR. SCHULDER:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

10 Court,
11

Thank you.

the guestion presented in this immigration case

is whether a permanent resident alien who is believed by

12 immigration

authorities to be excludable from the United

13 States on his return from a trip abroad is entitled to
14 litigate the issues of his entry and excludability in a
15 deportation hearing,

as the court of appeals of the

16 Ninth Circuit held in
17 exclusion hearing,

this case, rather than in an

as Congress mandated in the

18 Immigration and Nationality Act.
19

Before proceeding to the facts of the case, I

20 would like to put this guestion into some perspective by
21

22

briefly reviewing some of the pertinent statutes.
The Immigration Act preserves a long-standing

23 distinction

between aliens arriving at the border

24 seeking admission to this country and aliens who are
25 already within the United

States.

Aliens who are

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

arriving at the border seeking admission or readmission

2 who are believed not entitled to enter are subject to
3

exclusion proceedings.

4

States who are believed not entitled to remain are

5

subject to deportation proceedings.
The Immigration Act provides various

6
7

Aliens who are within the United

categories of excludable aliens, and also provides

8 procedures governing the exclusion of inadmissible
9

aliens.
Under 8 USC 1225, every alien arriving at a

10
11

U.S. port of entry and seeking admission or readraission

12

to this country is subject to inspection by an

13

immigration officer.

14

beyond a doubt to the immigration officer to be entitled

15

to land, he is detained for an exclusion hearing that is

16

conducted before an immigration judge.

If the alien does not appear

These exclusion procedures apply whenever an

17
18

alien attempts an entry into the United States.

The

19

term "entry" is defined in the Act, 8 USC 1101(a)(13),

20 as any coming of an alien into the United States from a
21

foreign country.

However, there is an exception to this

22 broad definition in the case of permanent resident
23

aliens.

A return to the United States following an

24

unintentional departure by a lawful permanent resident

25

alien is not regarded as an entry.

In Rosenberg versus Fleuti, this Court held

The

6 in this way in order to protect resident aliens from
7

unsuspected risks and unintended consequences of wholly

8 innocent actions.
9

One of the factors that the Court noted in

10

Fleuti as being crucial in determining the nature of an

11

alien’s trip is whether the purpose of the trip was to

12

accomplish an object contrary to the policies reflected

13

in our immigration laws.

14

The facts of this case show that Respondent, a

15

native and citizen of El Salvador, was admitted to the

16

United States as a permanent resident alien in 1970.

17

June 29th, 1975, Respondent was returning from a two-day

18

trip to Mexico with her husband when she was arrested at

19

the border for attempting to smuggle six illegal aliens

20

into this country.

Respondent was detained for an

22 excludable under a provision of the Immigration Act that
23

provides for the exclusion of any alien who knowingly

and for gain aids the attempted illegal entry of aliens

into this country.

QUESTION*

1

Mr. Schulder, was the husband

2 charged with any offense?

MR. SCHULDER*

3

No, the husband is a United

4 States citizen.

QUESTION*

5

I know that, but was he charged

6 with any offense?

MR. SCHULDER*

7
8 offense.

No, he was not charged with any

Your Honor, as far as I am aware.

The record

9 doesn't reflect otherwise.

The exclusion hearing was held the

10
11

following -QUESTlONi

12

Mr. Schulder, is it the

13 government's position that assuming an exclusion
14 proceeding is the proper proceeding, that the alien is
15 entitled to due process at that hearing?
16

MR. SCHULDER*

17

QUESTION*

Absolutely, yes.

And what process is due, do you

18 think?
19

MR. SCHULDER*

Well, as this Court noted in

20 Kvong Hai Chew versus Colding,
21

that a resident alien

returning from a trip abroad is entitled to notice of

22 the charges and an opportunity -- and a hearing and an
23 opportunity to respond to those charges.
24

QUESTION*

Do you think some specific period

25 of time has to be given in which to prepare for the

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

hearing?

2

MB. SCHULDER:

Hell, I am not sure that the

3

Constitution mandates a fixed period of time.

4

period would have to be sufficient for the purposes of

5

preparing aieguately to respond to the charges in any

The

6 given situation.
7

QUESTION*

Mr. Schulder, Kwong Hai Chew just

8 construed a regulation, didn't it?
9

any constitutional holding.
MR. SCHULDERs

10
11

It didn't involve

Well, that's correct.

The

Court construed —

12

QUESTION:

What about the language in Knauff

13

versus Shaughnessy, that whatever the procedure

14

authorized by Congress is, it is due process so far as

15

an alien denied entry is concerned?
MR. SCHULDER:

16

Well, the Court in Kwong Hai

17

Chew strongly suggested that it would have

18

constitutional problems with the regulation that it

19

construed.

20

QUESTION:

But it certainly didn't hold that.

21

MR. SCHULDER:

It did not go so far as to hold

22 that there was an absolute —
23
24
25

QUESTION*

You treat that case as though it

was a holding.
QUESTION*

Yes.

QUESTION;

3

MR. SCHULDER;

4

Your practice is now -Well, the Immigration Service

has accepted that case, and the District of Columbia QUESTION;

5

6

Hell, the Immigration —

You mean the implications of the

case?
MR. SCHULDER;

7

The implications of the case,

8 and the District of Columbia Circuit's decision in Kvong
9
10

Hai Chew versus Rogers that an alien, resident alien is
entitled to due process —
QUESTION;

11
12

Do you think the Circuit Court of

the District of Columbia can overrule the Knauff case?
HR. SCHULDER;

13

No, Your Honor.

What I am

14

saying is that the Immigration Service has essentially

15

acceded to the strong suggestion by this Court in Kwong

16

Hai Chew versus Colding that any procedure involving a

17

returning resident alien that appears to be contrary to

18

due process would be struck down under the due process

19

clause. -

20
21

QUESTION;

Well, of course, naturally, any

procedure contrary to the due process would be struck

22 down under the due process clause, but Knauff says
23
24
25

whatever procedure Congress provides is due process.
MR. SCHULDER;

That's correct.

But this Court

in Kwong Hai Chew and in the later cases that discuss

Kwong Hai Chew do, I believe, make the point -- Kvong

2 Hai Chew was not a due process case as such, but in
3 Rosenberg versus Fleuti,

for example, the Court

4 described Kwong Hai Chew — the decision in Kwong Hai
5 Chew as having constitutional overtones.

I concede that

6 there was no absolute constitutional holding in that
7 case, but for these purposes, in any event,

the

8 Immigration Service has accepted the proposition that a
9 returning resident alien is entitled to a hearing and

--

10 notice and a hearing, an opportunity to respond to
11

charges.
QUESTION*

14 kind of hearing

But the Service has not, as I

drafted separate regulations to cover the
that is required for a returning

15 permanent resident as opposed to a brand new person.
16 mean,

I

you don't have anything other than deportation

17 regulations

and exclusion hearing regulations.

18

MR. SCHULDER*

19

QUESTION*

That’s correct.

So that you don't in your actual

20 rules differentiate between the two kinds of cases?

MR. SCHULDER:

21

Well, the regulations

22 themselves do not differentiate, but the Board of
23 Immigration
24 between
25

Appeals in its decisions has differentiated

—
QUESTION*

Well, can we tell from its

decisions, for example, the answer to Justice O'Connor's

2 question?

What kind of advance notice is the returning

3 permanent resident entitled to receive before being put
4 on trial?
5
6

Ten minutes, or 24 hours, or what?
ME. SCHULDER*

Well, the only standard that I

am specifically aware of, Your Honor, is the Board of

7 Immigration Appeals has said that an alien may be
8 excluded on the basis of charges that are not

9 necessarily included in the formal written notice of the
10

charges received prior to a hearing.

However, the alien

11

is entitled to a reasonable opportunity to respond to

12 those charges.

13

I am not aware of any specific holding of the

14 Board of Immigration Appeals that —

It sounds like there is no

I don't think we can even tell from the

It may have been ten minutes.
MR. SCHULDERs

And here, what

It is not absolutely clear from

the record what the notice was.

QUESTION*

Is there any requirement that the

23 parson be advised of any right to be represented by
24 counsel?

MR. SCHULDER*

Yes, the Immigration Service's

Does that advice include advice as

to how to find a lawyer?
MR. SCHULDER*

At the time of the hearing

At the conclusion of Respondent’s exclusion

hearing, the immigration judge found that Respondent was

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

excludable based on clear, convincing, and unequivocal

2 evidence.

This is the same standard that applies in

3

deportation hearings.

4

Respondent had made an entry because she engaged in

5

conduct contrary to the immigration laws.

6

Fleuti, Respondent’s departure was not unintended within

the exception to the entry doctrine in the Immigration

In addition, the judge found that

Thus, under

8 Act.
9

After exhausting her administrative appeals,

10

Respondent petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the

11

U.S. District Court for the Central District of

12

California.

13

Immigration Service with directions to proceed against

14

Respondent, if at all, only in deportation proceedings.

15

The District Court remanded the case to the

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit

16

affirmed and held that whenever a resident alien

17

returning Erom a trip abroad claims that his trip was

18

not meaningfully interruptive of his permanent

19

residence, the issues of entry and excludability must be

20 litigated in deportation and not in exclusion
21

proceedings.

Thus, under the Ninth Circuit’s holding,

22 every returning resident alien coming back from a trip
23

abroad, no matter the duration or no matter the purpose

24

for which that trip was undertaken, is automatically

25

entitled to return to this country so long as that alien

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

claims that his departure was not meaningfully

2 interruptive.
3

There is no basis in law for the Court of

Appeals decision.

in this case, by holding that resident aliens are

6

entitled to deportation proceedings, has disregarded the

clear distinction that Congress drew in the Immigration

proceedings.

If there is one thing that is clear in the

10

area of immigration law, it is that Congress has broad

11

authority over immigration matters, including

12

particularly the admission of aliens into this country.

13

The Ninth Circuit's decision in this case has interfered

14

with the Congress's exercise of its authority.

15

The court purported to base its decision on

16

Kwong Hai Chew versus Colding, and the subsequent

17

decision of the D.C. Circuit in Kwong Hai Chew versus

18

Rogers, which established that the immigration

19

authorities at an exclusion hearing have the burden of

20 proving excludability.
21

The Ninth Circuit in this case assumed that

22 the Immigration Service has ignored the burden of proof
23

requirement of the D.C. Circuit in Kwong Hai Chew versus

24

Rogers, but in fact, as we show in our brief, the

25

Immigration Service has accorded returning resident

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

aliens a hearing at which the government bears the

2 burden of proving excludability, so that the court's
3

decision is based on a totally erroneous impression of

4

the type of procedures that are available at an

5

exclusion hearing to a resident alien.

6
7

Respondent has tried to defend the holding
below by raising some additional arguments.

Respondent

8 first argues that the procedures available to permanent
9

resident aliens in exclusion proceedings do not satisfy

10

due process standards.

11

framing of the issue here.

12

mentioned in response to Justice O'Connor's question,

13

fully agrees that resident aliens should receive

14

procedures that meet due process standards, but that

15

does not mean that resident aliens are entitled to a

16

deportation hearing rather than to the exclusion hearing

17

that Congress provided for in the Act.

18
19

We disagree with Respondent's
The government, as I

If the procedures at exclusion hearings need
to be strengthened to meet due process standards, the

20 remedy is to provide proper safeguards in exclusion
21

hearings, not to provide aliens with a right to

22 deportation hearings, which is simply contrary to
23

Congress's decision in establishing exclusion hearings

24

in the Immigration Act.

25

Respondent also argues —

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

May I interrupt once more?

Is it

2 the government's position that at this particular
3 hearing, this person lid receive due process?
4

MR. SCHULDER;

Yes, we believe that Respondent

5 did receive due process, but we like to point out that
6 Respondent did not really raise the due process issues
7 that she is now raising here in the courts below.

For

8 example, the claim about inadequate notice was never
9 raised either in the district court or in the court of
10 appeals.
11

QUESTION;

The due process point.

12

MR. SCHULDER;

That is clearly an argument,

13 yes.
14

QUESTION;

What you really mean is, they got

15 due process on this type of a hearing, but it wouldn't
16 be due process on a deportation hearing.

Are you

17 arguing that there are different degrees of due
18 process?
19

MR. SCHULDER;

20

QUESTION;

21

MR. SCHULDERs

22

QUESTION;

Well,

the deportation —

Is that your position?
I'm not —

You have different types of due

23 process?
24

MR. SCHULDER;

There are different types of

25 due process, depending on the —

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

Some are a whole lot, and some are

2 a little?
3

MR. SCHULDER;

Well, our position is that it

4 is not absolutely necessary that the precise procedures
5 that happen to be available in deportation hearings have
6 to be provided in exclusion hearings.
7 different levels.
8

There are

That is true.

QUESTION;

But as I understand you, you do

9 concede that the process required in the exclusion of a
10 permanent resident alien may be greater than the process
11 required for an alien who is not a permanent alien.
12

MR. SCHULDER;

That's correct.

f

13

QUESTION;

But you also say that the process

14 given here satisfies your concept of that intermediate
15 level of process that the Constitution requires.
16

MR. SCHULDER;

That's correct, but the point,

17 the major point that we make here is that even if there
18 was a problem here in terms of the process that was
19 provided, the Ninth Circuit's remedy was totally wrong.
20

QUESTION;

What would the proper — you say

21 the remedy isn't to require a deportation hearing.
22

MR. SCHULDER;

23

QUESTION*

That's correct.

The remedy is to require sort of an

24 intermediate hearing.
25

MR. SCHULDER;

That's correct.

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION*

Now, how should that be done,

2 assuming that we thought you were wrong on the adequacy
3 of the process in this case?

How should the rules for

4 such a hearing be formulated?
5

You are saying, well,

they don't have deportation, and if you conceded that

6 the exclusion rules were not adequate in this
7 intermediate category,

what is to be done in the

8 government’s view?

MR. SCHULDER;

9

10 Service is informed
11

Well, if the Immigration

of the deficiencies in any of its

procedures in exclusion hearings, it should be — it

12 would provide for regulations,

QUESTION;

13

I would think.

I thought you said that they should

14 improve the exclusionary hearing.

MR. SCHULDER;

15

That's correct, but I'm saying

16 that the Service most likely would provide specifically
17 for regulations that would

deal with permanent resident

18 aliens in an exclusion setting.

QUESTION*

19
20

21

do?

Well, could we tell them what to

Could we tell them what type of rules to set out?
MR. SCHULDER*

Well, the Court conceivably

22 could say that the particular procedures —
23

QUESTION*

Conceivably, or could?

24

MR. SCHULDER*

The Court could certainly say

25 that the procedures that were made available here were

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

not adequate, but the point that I was trying to make

2 earlier is that the issue really is not properly
3 presented here, because it hadn’t- been presented either
4 in the district court or the court of appeals, and that
5 because of the peculiar posture of the case, there is
6

really no basis for relying on this as an alternative

7 ground for affirmance, since the proper remedy if due
8 process was not provided would not be to send

the case

9 back for a deporta-tion hearing, but instead to send the
10 case back

for an exclusion hearing.

11

QUESTIONS

12 procedural history,

13 persuading,

The case has sort of a peculiar
because the alien was successful in

I guess, both the magistrate and the

14 district court and the court of appeals that she was
15 entitled to a deportation hearing.
16

SR. SCHULDERs

17

QUESTIONS

18 for her to say,

That’s correct.

So there really wasn’t an occasion

well, in the alternative, if I don't get

19 that, I should at least get something more than I
20 received in

21

this particular case.

NR. SCHULDERs

Well, she certainly had the

22 opportunity to raise that claim in the district court.
23

QUESTION:

Did she raise it?

24

MR. SCHULDERs

Well, she did argue that she

25 was entitled to the procedural safeguards of the

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

deportation hearing, but what the record actually shows

2 is that she was arguing for an entitlement to entry into
3

the country and being placed in deportation proceedings

4

rather than to the same types of safeguards that happen

5 to be available in the deportation context.

6

QUESTION

7 it,
8

Well, Hr. Schulder, just to clarify

as far as the government is concerned, this Court

could be asked to simply determine whether she was

9 entitled to a deportation proceeding or an exclusion
10

proceeding, and if it were determined that she were

11

entitled to an exclusion proceeding, just remand it for

12 that without attempting to spell out all of the
13 requirements for that proceeding.

In other words, in this case, Bespondent was

21

found to have attempted to smuggle illegal aliens into

22 the country, and that finding established both that she
23 was excludable and also that she had made a meaningful
24 interruption of her permanent residence,

and thus had

25 been attempting an entry.

that the Immigration Act requires the Immigration

because of an alleged immigration violation.

May I ask one other question on the

4 What point in time is relevant for determining the
5 alien's intent when a criminal activity is disclosed as

Is it important whether the

And you would satisfy that clearly

14 here even if -- assuming your proof is correct.
15

MR. SCHULDER;

Absolutely.

In fact.

16 Respondent's testimony acknowledged — she herself
17 acknowledged that she did intend to bring these aliens
18 in illegally.

The only issue at the hearing was one of

19 whether she had done it for gain or not.

That went to

20 the excludability question, not to the entry question.
21

QUESTION;

On that point, on the gain, the

22 trial examiner, the judge, whatever he was called, on

23 Page 33 of the abstract asked one of the witnesses if it
24 was the witness's understanding that he was going to pay
25 the alien an amount of $200 after he arrived in Los

although he didn’t indicate whether it was based on

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY H. MANULKIN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. MANULKINs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

3 please the Court, I would like to begin argument with a
4 little discussion of the manner of the framing of the
5 issues by the court below, by the Petitioner, and by the
6

Respondent, because I think that will tend to simplify,

7 at least for my purposes, further argument, the
8

reasoning behind our argument or behind our briefs, and

9 behind the decision and the rationale of the court below.
10

11

The court below stated the issue as whether
Plasencia was entitled to have her violation of the

12 immigration laws and the purpose of her trip determined

13 in deportation rather than exclusion proceedings.

Now,

14 neither the Petitioner nor the Respondent —

16 example, would be greater in the deportation proceeding
17 than in the exclusion?
18

MR. MANULKIN;

In the — I am sorry.

Are you

19 asking whether the notice is different in the two,
20 deportation and exclusion?
21

QUESTION*

Yes.

Wouldn't she have had more

22 notice in order to meet the problem she was facing?

23

MR. MANULKINs

Yes.

In a deportation

24 proceeding, the Title 8 of the Code of Federal
25 Regulations, Section 242, does require seven days'

I am not talking about the number

The content of the notice.
SR. MANULKIN;

Hell, the content is

different —
QUESTION;

So that she would know what it was

she was being charged with.
SR. MANULKIN;

From the record — I was not

present at the time of the hearing, but from the record,

10

I can only determine that the notice was written to her

11

a few minutes before the judge proceeded, the

12

immigration judge in this case proceeded with the

13

presentation of the case and allowed the trial attorney

14

to go forward, and from the record again, I only discern

15

that the judge read that you are being charged with

16

aiding and abetting the entry of aliens into the United

17

States for gain, the illegal entry of those aliens,

18

although I will say that the notice itself was a little

19

difficult to read, and I noticed that someone in fact

20 had to make some marks over it to be read.
21

Now, in a deportation proceeding, the notice

22 is somewhat different.

There is an order to show cause

23

that is issued on the Respondent that has a number of

24

factual allegations, such as in her case it would have

25

said, you are a native and citizen of El Salvador, you

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 entered the Units! States as a permanent resident on
2 whatever date it was in 1970, Parch, 1970, and you left
3 the United States and departed from the United States on
4 such and so date, and you were charged with, and found
5 with aliens in your automobile, upon your re-entry to
6 the United States on such and so date.
7

And then, after those allegations of fact are

8 being charged, then it will say the legal ground for
9 charge of deportability.

In this case, it would have

10 said that therefore, you are excludable from the United
11 States under Section 212(a) (31) of the Immigration and
12 Nationality Act.

Now, that is the way a deportation

13 notice would in fact be presented to her seven days
14 before the hearing was to commence, and then, of course,
15 at that hearing it is simply an arraignment type of a
16 hearing, where she is just asked to plead, do you admit
17 the facts and admit deportability or deny them?
18

If in fact she has counsel present, counsel in

19 almost all instances will ask for some additional time
20 in which to review the evidence against her.
21

Now, in an exclusion proceeding such as this

22 at the border, it is extremely difficult, most
23 obviously, for any alien who does not speak our language
24 and is — in this case, Mrs. Plasencia, of course, was
25 at San Isidro, 100 miles from her home in Los Angeles,

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

ani it was extremely difficult for her at that remote

2 location to obtain counsel with approximately maybe 12
3 hours* notice.

It is hard to tell from the record.

It

4 looks as though she was arrested the evening before, and
5 the hearing concluded at 11i00 a.m. the next morning, so
6 she probably had around 12 hours to obtain counsel.
7 They were not wealthy people, and so they may very well
8 have had to have contacted one of the organizations in
9 Los Angeles that were able to do pro bono or other kinds
10 of free representation.
11

QUESTION;

Hr. Manulkin, getting back to what

12 the government said, suppose the rule is changed which
13 says simply that at an explusion hearing you have the
14 exact same as the deportation hearing.

Would you be

15 here?
16

HR. MANULKIN;

Well, the difficulty that we

17 feel there is with that type of a route would be the
18 preclusion of all of those sections of the Immigration
19 Act that are not regulation but statutory sections, such
20 as a stay of deportation in Section 243(h), which she
21 would very possibly —

MR. MANULKIN:

I think Chew v. Colding is our

I think the Chew v. Colding decision in 1953 is

15 the answer.

If you assimilate Mrs. Plasencia to the

16 status of a continuing permanent resident who continues
17 to reside in the United States even after and even
18 during a brief visit outside the United States, then she
19 must be given deportation proceedings, if she has in
20 fact assimilated to that status.

QUESTION:

Chew had simply taken passage on an

22 American ship, hadn't he?

He hadn't deliberately left

MR. MANULKIN:

NR. MANULKIN;

No, he did not bring back

He would argue that the evidence is not

Plasencia, if

19 in fact there had been a charge of smuggling aliens,

20 would have been convicted of a charge of aiding and

abetting illegal entry, and that her husband in fact was

Mr. Manulkin, if we could go back

24 to the Chew case for a minute —

MR. MANULKIN;

1

QUESTION;

— would you agree that the Chew

2 decision does not give returning resident aliens a right

4 present resident?
5
6

SR. KANULKINs

No.

No, I would not agree with

that.

7

QUESTIONS

8

MR. MANULKINs

You don't agree.
And the reason I don't agree

9 with that is because of the language in the Chew v.
10

Colding, that specific language that says,

"to protect a

11

status described in those cases as assimilated to that

12 of an alien continuously residing and physically present
13 in the United States," that Chew was to be considered in
14 that light, and then, of course,

the Chew v. Rogers

15 decision, which was five years later, in

1958.

The D.C.

16 Circuit, upon remand from this Court, made the
17 determination that we will — the Court will remand for
18 deportation proceedings Mr.

Chew, and I think that is a

19 correction that we have to make- of the government's
20 brief.
21

If you read the last sentence, in fact, of the

Chew v. Rogers decision, it specifically says we are

22 remanding for deportation proceedings.
23

QUESTION;

Well, all that shows is that the

24 District of Columbia Circuit agrees with the Ninth
25 Circuit.

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

HR. MANULKIN;

Yes, that is true, and agrees,

2 they felt, agreed with the Supreme Court of the United
3

States.

4
5

QUESTION:

Well, Chew was actually decided

prior to the Immigration Act of 1952, when the Congress

6 codified all of these immigration policies.
7

The concept

of entry before 1952 was purely a judicial one.

It was

8 codified in 1952.
9

NR. MANULKIN:

I believe. Your Honor, that the

10

case was in fact -- you are right — begun before 1952,

11

but in actuality this Court's decision was rendered in

12

1953, after the 1952 Immigration Act.
QUESTION:

13
14

Yes, but it didn't purport to

construe the 1952 Act.
NR. MANULKIN:

15

Well, no, it did in one sense.

16

Section 101.813 of the Immigration and Nationality Act,

17

which defined entry, they did in the footnotes describe

18

some of the Congressional intent as to the reasoning

19

behind this change that was upcoming in the '52 Act in

20 that statute, which dealt with the harshness of the
21

strict entry rule, and it dealt very carefully with the

22 54 years, as it stated in the footnotes, of cases that
23

had come before, that had tried to accept to that strict

24

harshness.

25

QUESTION:

Well, are you suggesting that Chew

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

when the 1952 Act wasn’t before the Court, attempted to

2 cast doubt on the 1952 Act?

3

HR. MANULKIN;

No.

It basically was talking

4 about what the definition of entry was to be in the 1952
5 Act, and by the time the Court’s decision in fact was
6

published, the ’52 Act was history.

It had in fact been

7 promulgated, and passed by Congress.
8

I think I would like at this point to again

9 restate the issue difference in terms of the emphasis by
10

the government and the Respondent.

The government

11

states the charge of excludability itself, just the

12 charge calls for a conclusion of meaningful departure,

13 and therefore calls for a conclusion of exclusion rather
14 than deportation, not the proof of the charge, the
15 making of the charge by the Immigration Service.
16

The Respondent emphasizes that the person is a

17 returning permanent resident who has lived in the United
18 States, has a home in the United States, had been
19 admitted to the United States as a permanent resident at
20 one time, had gone through all of the inspection
21

process, had been given a permanent resident card, and

22 then made a brief visit, a two-day visit to Tiajuana,

23 and was returning from that two-day visit.
24

Now, the question is not whether the charge of

25 smuggling aliens or aiding and abetting illegal entry is

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

true or false at that point, until there has been a

2 hearing to make that determination.

In this case, the

3 fact that the District Director of Immigration handed
4 this piece of paper, which was the exclusion notice,
5 Mrs. Plasencia,

to

the mere handing, that act of handing

6 that to her, made her excludable instead of deportable.

That is what we have a great deal of

7

8 difficulty in understanding, that approach,

and we feel

9 that is exactly what happened in Rosenberg versus
10

Fleuti, which is what we would like to see happen in

11

this case, which is that a deportation proceeding should

12 have been initiated under Section 241(a)(1) of the
13 Immigration

and Nationality Act, which states that a

14 person is now deportable if they were at the time of any
15 entry excludable.

Now, of course, the 32 grounds of

16

17 excludability are encompassed within Section 241(a)(1),
18 so the government certainly would have not been
19 prejudiced by the bringing of that deportation charge,
20 and

21

through Section 212(a)(31),

could have then been

adjudicated in a deportation setting, and it is possible

22 that the conclusion of that case would have been that
23 she was found excludable because she had — deportable
24 because she had been excludable at the time of entry.
25

QUESTION;

You say it is possible?

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

ME. MANULKIN:

1

The evidence is very difficult

2 from the 20-some pages of transcript to determine, I

3 feel.

I feel it is very conflicting as to whether or

4 not it is possible that she was the smuggler, whether
5 that was in fact a matter of gain on her part when $25
6 was paid to her husband for gas.

I think it is a very

7 difficult proof by the government, and in fact I might
8 even suggest that there might have been some reason for

9 the government not going forward on a criminal charge.
10
11
12

The question was asked earlier in that regard.
QUESTION;

Mr. Manulkin, if the alien had been

out of the country for five years under your theory,
t

13 would that alien be entitled on coming back in to say,

15 to a deportation hearing.

the difference?
MS. MANULKINs

No, no, because in that

8 particular case, there is not a brief visit outside the

9 United States, in either Shaughnessy versus Mezei or the
10

factual situation that you just presented.

11

arguing with the fact that the Immigration Service has

12 the

We are not

right to control its borders as to persons who are

13 not residing therein.
14

QUESTION:

Why shouldn't the government be

15 entitled to proceed at an exclusion proceeding, as the
16 statute might well indicate, and simply afford the alien
17 whatever process is due?
18

MR. MANULKIN*

Well, I think one of the most

19 difficult problems with a person put into that situation
20 would be the sections dealing with
21

the amelioration of

the hardships attendant to being deported from the

22 United States, such as, I mentioned earlier Section

23 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which
24 states that a person can apply for a stay of deportation
25 if there is a well-founded fear of the likelihood of

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

persecution on the basis of race, religion, or political

2 opinion.

3

Now, this particular individual, for example,

4 Mrs. Plasencia, has a U.S. citizen husband, four
5 permanent resident children who were coining of military
I

6

age, who were getting older.

Taking this family back to

7 El Salvador might have given her, and a showing to the
8

Court and proof to the Court that she has a fear of

9 likelihood of returning to El Salvador with this family,
10 might well have occasioned
11

the immigration judge to

grant a stay of deportation, but as the cases, and this

12 Court is one of the decision-makers on that issue,

that

13 243(h) does not apply to a person who is a respondent in
14 exclusion proceedings.

So she would be precluded from

15 making that application for, in the vernacular, asylum
16 or refugee status.
17

Also, another preclusion would be Section

18 244(a)(1) and 244(d) of the Immigration and Nationality
19 Act in that she could not apply for a suspension of
20 deportation
21

in an exclusion proceeding.

Again, the

courts, this Court and other courts have found that that

22 application could not be made in an exclusion proceeding

23 by an excludee only by someone who is in deportation
24 proceedings, and of course she could maybe very easily
25 show that it would be extreme and unusual hardship to

Now, if you prevailed here, could

any criminal charges be brought against her?
MR. MANULKINs

Under the possible statute of

The statute of limitations has

MR. MANULKINi

5

QUESTIONS

That's right.

Yes.

What about a deportation

proceeding, the full-scale proceeding that you would

7

like?

MS. MANULKINs

QUESTIONS

11

MR. MANULKINs

12

QUESTIONS

14

Yes, I believe that could

be brought.

10

13

Yes.

That could be brought?
Yes, I believe so.

The evidence is seven years old

now, isn't it?
MR. MANULKINs

Well, the government did have

15

written statements from all of the witnesses, as we

16

understand it, and written statements are admissible in

17

deportation proceedings when there is unavailability of

18

the individuals to testify, so I believe the government

19

would be very little prejudiced by holding a deportation

20 hearing today.
21

As a matter of fact, in this particular case,

22 I might call your attention to the fact that the written
23

statements that were presented as evidence in court were

24

never read to Mrs. Plasencia, but yet she was being

25

asked to cross examine the maker of those statements.

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

She was not — She was, if you will look at the

2 transcript of the record, she was handed the statement
3 in English, saying, do you object to the admission of
4 this statement, but there is no indication that it was
5 -- she doesn't read English — that it was ever
6 translated to her.
7

QUESTION*

How long had she lived in the

8 United States before?
9

HR. MANULKIN*

She had — It is not in the

10 record. Your Honor.
11

QUESTION*

Well,

she's got three children that

12 are getting ready to go in the Army.
13

HR. MANULKIN*

Well, as a matter of fact, I

14 believe only one of those was a son, but she had come to
15 tha United States in probably the late sixties, about
16 1968, and then immigrated in 1970.
17

QUESTION*

Did she bring those children with

18 her?
19

MR. MANULKIN*

20

QUESTION*

Yes, she did.

I thought you said they were

21 American citizens
22

MR. MANULKIN*

No, the children never became

23 American citizens
24

QUESTION*

Oh, I guess I misunderstood you.

25

MR. MANULKIN*

They are still permanent

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 residents.

I am sorry I didn’t make that clear.

Her

2 husband is a U.S. citizen, and in fact he immigrated her
3 to the United States in 1970 while remaining here, which4 was through an adjustment of status type of approach,
5 which precludes her from having to go back to San
6 Salvador to obtain her permanent residence.
7

I really believe that the government is asking

8 this Court to overrule Chew v. Colding.

Looking at the

9 case, looking at this case, the facts of the two cases,
10 I cannot see any substantive differences.

It has been

11 mentioned that Mr. Chew did not leave for a foreign
12 country, yet the ship did, of course, stop in foreign
13 ports.
14

QUESTION;

Hell, why couldn’t I — I could

15 personally distinguish on the fact that he wasn't
16 importing illegal aliens?
17

MR. MANULKIN;

Because he was a danger to

18 national security, as I would —
19

QUESTIONi

Well, that is a distinguishing

20 proposition, isn’t it?
21*

MR. MANULKIN;

It would be a matter, I

22 suppose, of weighing which is more in violation of
23 immigration policy, to aid and abet illegal entry or to
24 become a danger to national security.
25

QUESTION;

I am not maybe —

Well, Chew also simply construed a

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

regulation.

It didn't make any holding on any

2 constitutional issue.
3

statute?

ME. MANULKIN*

QUESTION*

The footnote discusses it in two

sentences.

8

MR. MANULKIN*

9

QUESTION*

10
11

It only — like I said. Your

Honor, in the footnotes, discussed 1018.13, which —

6
7

When did it construe the 1952

Yes, it does.

You are right.

Not in the long discourse which you

are suggesting.
MR. MANULKIN*

No, you are right, it does not

12

go into a long discussion of the 1952 Act, but I believe

13

I would differ in that it did in fact construe the

14

situation of a continuing permanent resident as to the

15

amount of procedural protections and due process that

16

that individual is entitled to, whatever the statute is,

17

whether it was a pre-*52 statute or a post-'52.

18
19

QUESTION*

Doesn't Chew contain the statement

that all we are doing is construing this regulation and

20 saying it wasn't authorized by statute?
21

MR. MANULKIN*

22

QUESTION*

It did attempt to limit —

I thought it quite successfully

23

limited it.

I don't think Justice Bergman was incapable

24

of limiting an opinion like that.

25

MR. MANULKIN*

Well, I believe, Your Honor,

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that you are right, that it did construe a regulation,

2 and

I believe that it did attempt to narrow at the very

3 latter part of the case, after it had already said these
4 words in different contexts three or four times,
5 "assimilated to the status of a continuing permanent
6

resident."

It said that four times through the case,

7 and it is very difficult unless you read Chew having
8

been outside the United States for four months, our

9 client having been outside the United States for two
10 days,

11

both challenging immigration policies —
QUESTIONs

12 authorizes what was

But here, the statute clearly
done, and in Chew they simply held

13 the statute didn't authorize what was done.
14

HR. MANULKIN:

That is basically true.

15 is basically true, Your Honor.

You were dealing, again,

16 like you said, with a regulation, not a statute.
17 we do have a statute.

That

Here

The statute, of course, does

18 include an element of gain, and I think it is important
19 also for this Court to become aware of the fact that
20 this is different for criminal proceedings than it is
21

22

for civil proceedings.
Section 1324, Title 8 of the United States

23 Code talks about smuggling of aliens as being a crime,
24 but it does not bother to mention the word "gain."
25 is not an element in the criminal context.

Gain

It is only

41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

in the immigration context.

And because of that, it is

2 really a more difficult prove up, I would guess, for the
3

government in a criminal context, and again I draw your

4

attention to the fact that the government did not

5

proceei against either Mr. or Mrs. Plasencia in a

6 criminal proceeding, bringing a criminal charge, and in
7

fact if they had, we might not be here today, because we

8

would then have had procedural protections in that

9

criminal context.

We would have had right to counsel,

10

and notice, and Fifth Amendment self-incrimination

11

rights, as you -QUESTION*

12
13

How would that help her on her

exclusion?
MR. MANULKIN*

14

Well, it wouldn’t, as a matter

15

of fact, help her if she were found guilty. Your Honor.

16

It would in fact cause an easier situation for the

17

immigration judge to present the conviction as evidence

18

of excludability, and then we might have a little

19

different -- more difficulty with the government in

20 arguing against them.

QUESTION*

21

The government might at that time

22 have decided to prosecute him and not her, if she was
23

excludable and excluded.
MR. MANULKIN:

24
25

Honor.

They did not.

They did not though. Your
They didn't proceed against

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

either one.

The evidence was very contradictory, and

2 they might have read

the evidence, and they might have

3 seen that this one witness, the number one witness in
4 the case, in fact made contradictory statements the
5 night before under oath in both cases.
6 misstated her name.

She even

She misstated how much money

7 supposedly was to be promised, $300 the night before,
8 $250 the next morning.

She misstated the fact that it

9 was the wife of her uncle that she was traveling with.
10

In fact, during the hearing she says, I have no family.

11

So if you look at the contradictions of her

12 evidence,

I think the United States Attorney’s office

13 just decided that this would be a very difficult case to
14 prosecute.
15

I think I would like to draw finally the

16 attention to the differences in exclusion and
17 deportation proceedings and the particular prejudices to
18 Mrs. Plasencia in this cse.

Me have already talked

19 about the stay of deportation, the notice of charges.
20 The continuances that are granted regularly in
21

deportation proceedings, I think, hre crucial.

An

22 immigration attorney must in fact prepare seven, ten,

23 twelve, fifteen weeks, sometimes, for a case such as
24 this, to be ready to argue it, and I would like to ask
25 this Court to find that Mrs. Plasencia will be held in

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

deportation proceedings, and that it will be the

2 obligation of the government to prove her deportability,
3

and I would ask this Court to not overturn Chew v.

4

Colding.

Wait a minute.

Well, does your client agree with

you ?
HR. HANULKIN:

17

Well, certainly not.

Certainly

18

not.

I would agree with you that she does not want to

19

be held in deportation proceedings, but we are asking

20

for an affirmance of the lower court’s determination.

21

We feel that is our obligation.

Thank you.

Unless

22 there are any other questions.

further, Mr. Schulder?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELLIOTT SCHULDER, ESQ.,

2
3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MR. SCHULDER*

5

Respondent has conceded here that greater

6

Yes, Your Honor.

procedural protections could be provided for resident
V

7

aliens in exclusion proceedings.

I think it is quite

8

apparent from Mr. Manulkin's argument that what

9

Respondent relly wants here is the opportunity to be

10

eligible for a whole variety of discretionary forms of

11

relief that are available to aliens only in a

12

deportation context, and not in an exclusion context,

13

but due process does not entitle an alien to these

14

substantive forms of relief.

15

statute that provides which aliens in which types of

16

proceedings are entitled to certain substantive

17

remedies.

18
19

It is Congress and the

I think it is simply a distortion of the whole
statutory scheme to allow resident aliens like

20 Respondent to be placed in deportation proceedings where
21

they will be given all kinds of substantive remedies

22 that Congress specifically declined to give to these
23

people when it separated exclusion proceedings from

24

deportation proceedings in the statute.

25

I would also like to point out that

45

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Respondent's claims of inadequate notice and the other

2 procedural deficiencies that she alleges are a red
3

herring here.

4

the Board of Immigration Appeals, and in fact she was

5

represented by counsel in a motion to reopen before the

6

Board of Immigration Appeals, and if her claims had been

7

rejected, she could have appealed to the Ninth Circuit

She could have raised these claims before

8 and then to this Court raising the due process claims.
9

The fact of the matter is that she did not

10

raise any of these claims either before the BIA or in

11

the District Court or Court of Appeals.

12

Finally, I think Justice O'Conner hit the nail

13

on the head when she asked my adversary whether he

14

conceded that where an alien has taken a trip of five

15

years or of extended duration, whether he would still be

16

arguing that there was an entitlement to a deportation

17

proceeding.

18

there would not be such entitlement, but the whole point

19

of this case is where and in what forum is the

Counsel conceded in response to that that

20 determination made as to whether the trip was brief or
21

not.
In fact, the Ninth Circuit in a number of

22
23

cases has held that fairly extensive trips abroad do not

24

amount to extensive enough visits to interrupt permanent

25

residence.

46

1

And I would like to make one final point in

2 response to Respondent's argument relying on Kwong Hai

3 Chew versus Colding, the language that a resident alien
4 is to be assimilated to an alien continuously residing
5 and physically present.

1

At Page 596 of Volume 344 of U.S. Reports, it

2 is true that the Court said, for purposes of his
3 constitutional right to due process we assimilate
4 petitioner's status to that of an alien continuously
5 residing and physically present in the United States.
6

3ut several pages later, on page 601, the

7 Court says, it may well be that an alien's ultimate
8 right to remain in the United States is subject to
9 alteration by statute or authorized regulation because
10 of a voyage undertaken by him to foreign ports.
11

The point of our submission here is that the

12 determination whether an alien is entitled to reenter
13 the United States after a trip abroad is to be made in
14 an exclusion setting, as Congress provided in the
15 immigration statute.

The Ninth Circuit, and Respondent

16 hece, have provided absolutely no justification in law
17 for. departing from the statutory scheme.
