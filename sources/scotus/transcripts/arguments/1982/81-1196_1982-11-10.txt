ORAL ARGUMENT OF RCSERT PRESSON, ESC.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. KOPPES

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

10

This case arises under 42 U.S.C. Section

11

1983.

12

his rights under the Eighth Amendment, made applicable

13

through the Fourteenth, to be free from cruel and

14

unusual punishment, this case then presents the issue of

15

what is the proper standard for the award of punitive

16

damages in an action under 42 U.S.C. Section 1933.

17

Last year in the case of City of Newport

On the basis of an allegation by the Plaintiff to

18

versus Fact Concerts, Incorporated, this Court stated

19

that in a proper case under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983

20

punitive damages were available.

21

what is a proper case.

22

because in the Newport case it was found that

23

municipalities were actually immune.

The question nout is

This had not been reached before

Although the issue was not directly reached
and did not have to be reached, there was a very strong

standard for punitive damages tuas •

3

opinion in that case this Court stated that a public

4

official mho knomingly and maliciously acts to deprive

5

one of his civil rights is a proper subject for punitive

6

damages.

In the course of the

This in turn echoes mhat this Court had said

in the earlier opinion» about three years earlier» in

Carey versus Piphus.

The Court did state that punitive damages mould

Mr. Presson» mhat have you been

able to discover in the may of legislative history at

18

21

anything specifically in the legislative history» mhat

22

MR. PRESSON;

I'm not amare of anything in

1

damages» and in faci I believe this Court stated, I

2

believe, in the Carey case that Congress in enacting

3

1533 had never really discussed the issue of damages

4

much at all.

5

QUESTION:

Would you agree that punitive

6

damages mere generally amarded in tort cases at that

time?

yes, as early as 1851.

terms in phrased -- phrased in terms, excuse me — of a

2

reckless disregard.

3

I believe, ICO years ago in the St. Paul case.

4

QUESTION:

This is what this Court has stated,

Didn't the Philadelphia, Wilmington

5

and Baltimore Railroad case, which had been decided by

6

this Court in 1858, talk about punitive damages in terms

7

that the injury complained of has been inflicted

8

maliciously or wantonly?

9

MR. PRESSON.

I'm not specifically familiar

10

with that particular case.

11

case cited in the brief indicates a reckless disregard

12

or whatever that is the equivalent of malicious intent,

13

is the way this Court phrased it at that time.

14

case I believe was rendered in 1875.

15

time I believe that's the indication this Court had

16

given as to what the appropriate standard was.

The Milwaukee and St. Paul

That

So about that same

I think, though, that whatever it might have

17
18

been immediately preceding the enactment of 1983 or

19

perhaps even for the short time thereafter, it is not

20

necessarily a static consideration.

21

very little, in fact nothing much, said about the issue

22

of damages pertaining to 1983, I think it is a rather

23

fluid concept, and this Court GUESTION:

24
25

Because there is so

What do you mean by "fluid

concept"?

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. PRESSON:

Well, in the Milwaukee and St.

2

Paul Railway case this Court rejected u/hat had evidently

3

earlier been the appropriate standard of gross

4

negligence as the standard» and said attempts to

5

adequately define gross negligence have been

6

ineffective» that is no longer the proper standard» and

7

redefined the standard in terms of reckless conduct»

8

which this Court said is of such a degree that it is the

9

equivalent of a malicious intent.

10

So in that sense, as early as 1375 there was

11

an attempt to redefine what an appropriate case for

12

punitive damages was.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. PRESSON:

15
16

For 1983 purposes?
That was not specifically a 1983

case, no, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think the standard

17

should be any stricter in 1983 cases than in other

18

types, tort cases for example?

19

MR. PRESSON:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. PRESSON:

MR. PRESSON:

It should be?
I believe so.

Why?
Well —

For example, an ordinary tort suit

against a drunken driver who strikes you in the street.

case?

MR. PRESSON:

for punitive damages were.

I know» but what do you think it

ought to be?

MR. PRESSON:

MR. PRESSON:

Pardon me?

What do you think it ought to be?
For state cases?

For the kind of case I've given

you» the hypothetical I've given you.

recklessness» intentional» malice» something like that?

16

MR. PRESSON:

Should it be

In state personal injury cases?

17

I would say that if I were standing before the Missouri

18

Supreme Court today I'd be arguing essentially the same

19

thing.

20

QUESTION.

That it has to be malicious

intent?

22

MR. PRESSON:

23

QUESTION:.

24
25

Yes.

And so you would apply that

standard to 1983 and to torts generally» would you?
MR. PRESSON:

I believe so, Your Honor.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION:

Are there Missouri cases allowing

2

punitive damages in garden variety tort cases» and if so

3

on the basis of tuhat standard?

4

MR. PRESSONJ

The basic standard is one of

5

recklessness»

6

instruction which was actually given in this case, that

7

pretty much is the Missouri-approved form instruction.

8

That was what the judge wanted to give, so he pulled out

9

the MAI form book and used that.

10

Your Honor.

In fact, if you lock at the

So that is the

standard in Missouri.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. PRESSON:

13

QUESTION:

In ordinary tort cases?
Right.

I'm still waiting for your answer

14

— maybe I missed it — to Justice Brennan's question of

15

why there should be a different standard for officers.

16

MR. PRESSON:

Well, I think particularly in

17

this situation, the role of the correctional officer or

18

any state official, who are the ones that are being

19

subject to 1583 — the qualified immunity which this

20

Court has recognized I think would be undermined by

21

application of any lesser standard.

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't that in itself afford

a substantial protection?
MR. PRESSON:
protection.

It affords a substantial

What it was designed to do, I believe, was

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

■to afford the protection from compensatory damages.

2

it would appear to me that if on the basis of that same

3

standard you're going to allow virtually unlimited

4

punitive damages» then you are essentially undermining

5

the protection which has been afforded by the qualified

6

immunity to begin with.

7

3ut

As this Court has pointed out in other

8

contexts» punitive damages are essentially

9

unreviewable.

10

Jury discretion is virtually unlimited.

QUESTION;

Doesn't the trial judge normally

11

have jurisdiction to reduce the amount of punitive

12

damages if the judge determines it's appropriate?

13

MR. PRESSON:

That is a possibility.

But as

14

this Court I believe stated in either the Foust or the

15

Gertz case» this is limited by only» to quote the Court*

16

"the gentle rule that it not be excessive."

17

I think»

18

occasions» they are virtually unlimited and courts

19

appear to be very reluctant to interfere with the jury

20

discretion.

21

Essentially

as this Court has pointed out on numerous

I know of a recent case out of the Court of

22

Appeals for the Eighth Circuit» again the court

23

indicating that it would probably not have made the same

24

determination on the appropriateness of punitive damages

25

in that case» but again on the other hand they didn't

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

think it mas an appropriate case for them to interfere

2

uiith the jury's discretion in that regard.

3

I believe the question of the appropriate

4

standard — quite apart from the Court's previous

5

indications in Carey and Newport, I believe the

6

rationale behind punitive damages can only be served by

7

a more explicit standard» and that explicit standard I

8

believe u>as best defined as uihat this Court has

9

indicated in terms of actual malice.

10
11

The primary purpose as I see it of 1933 is not
particularly punishment» as this Court noted in —

12

QUESTION:

MR. PRESSCN:

Pardon?

Actual malice; horn do you define

actual malice?

16

MR. PRESSON:

In terms of what this Court has

17

said in Carey and Newport:

18

deprive one of one's civil rights or to do specific

19

injury to that individual.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. PRESSON:

22

in those cases, yes» it would» Your Honor.

It isn't just a passive factor?
I don't believe it could be

1

3

QUESTION;

Not «van recklessness would satisfy

that» would it?
MR. PRESSON:

No» not as the standard» because

4

recklessness — this Court has indicated in the sense of

5

qualified immunity that one knew or should have known

6

that your actions were going to deprive someone of his

7

constitutional rights.

8

that the Court has never specifically used the term

9

"reckless" that I'm aware of» it seems to me that if one

And although in the context of

10

knew or should have known» that approaches being

11

reckless if it isn't in fact.

12

I think the Court then — the basic standard

13

of liability is a reckless standard» and it was

14

established at that level for a very particular reason.

15

In other words» it is not enough to say* well» the level

16

is already high» you don't need to go any higher for

17

punitive damages, because I think the level has been set

18

high for a very specific reason, that reason being that

19

for state officials who do exercise discretion and who

20

are therefore entitled to the protection of qualified

21

immunity, that the dangers of not acting or being

22

inhibited in their actions can often be as great or

23

greater than their actions themselves.

24

The Court pointed out the dangers of punitive

25

damages and their excessiveness and unpredictability in

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the Foust and Gertz cases cited in the Petitioner's

2

brief.

3

confident that punitive damages may not be available»

4

that say the labor union in the Foust case could still

5

feel compelled to pass up fair settlement offers or to

6

pursue frivolous claims» actions mhich this Court

7

described as not being in the best interests of the

8

union members.

9

In those cases» the Court indicated that even if

Similarly for state officials» their actions

10

often affect many other people other than the Plaintiff

11

who eventually sues them in a 1983 action.

12

particular here» the Defendant gas responsible not just

13

for the safety of the Plaintiff; he u»as responsible for

14

the safety of anywhere from 110 to 120 inmates in that

15

particular unit.

16

particular time regarding any one of them can affect the

17

safety and well-being of all of them» and I think he

18

needs to have the protection afforded by the qualified

19

immunity to make that informed discretion decision

20

without» as this Court has said» undue timidity.

21

In

QUESTION:

Mr. Presson, may I interrupt you

for just a second.

You mentioned earlier that the

25

Was there an objection made to the instruction in this

MR. PRESSONi

To the punitive damage» yes*

Your Honor.

QUESTION:

5

MR. PRESSONi

Y9s » there was.

Thank you.

I believe that as far as

6

furthering what this Court has indicated was the primary

7

purpose of 1983 apart from compensation» and that being

8

deterrence» it is best served by an explicit standard»

9

as explicit as is humanly possible.

Because if one

10

cannot predict uihat is being prohibited or one does not

11

knoui uihat is being prohibited» then it is very unlikely

12

that one could be deterred.

13

avoid uihat is subsequently construed to be prohibited»

14

then it is sheer happenstance* rather than the exercise

15

of an informed decisionmaking.

Or if one does happen to

17

punitive damages in this case, to make it more explicit,

deterrence rationale.

MR. PRESSON:

CUESTION:

That's correct.

Well» if one has been guilty of

5

denying someone his constitutional rights» wouldn't it

6

deter future constitutional violations if he had to pay

7

some smart money?

8
9

MR. PRESSON:

It can deter only if you can

come up u/ith a common principle such that you know what

10
11

QUESTION:

Well, the common principle I'm

12

suggesting is» he violated the Plaintiff's

13

constitutional rights.

14

MR. PRESSON:

15
16

That is not always in practice

that easy a determination to make, particularly —
QUESTION:

Whether it's easy or not, we start

17

with the premise that there's been the violation, he's

18

had a verdict in a 1933 suit because he's been denied

19

his constitutional rights.

20

MR. PRESSON:

21

QUESTION:

True.

All right.

Well, why in that

22

situation should not he then be subject to the payment

23

of smart money in the form of punitive damages?

24
25

MR. PRESSON:

Well, again I get back to the

reason for punitive damages, and that is in my mind

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

think by examining the cases which have dealt with Eight

come up with common language» but very few what I would

call common principles such that you could predict what

the result would be with any reasonable degree of

11

Some of the cases cited by the Plaintiff in

13

this field.

indicated that if you turn down a request for a transfer

15

specifically when th9 inmate identified why he wanted to

16

be transferred» and that was that he had been

threatened» they decided it is not an appropriate case

for a transfer and he subseauently then is assaulted»

that that didn't even present a case for liability.

as far as a reckless standard to begin with.

2

think when you look at the cases — and some of them

3

cited in the briefs do involve decisions of correctional

4

officers and officials dealing with custody status or

It is a difficult decision, and while in

15

hindsight a court and a jury might say, well, you were

guidance in the way of deterrence to the officers and

QUESTIONS

Do you know how often it's happened

in your state?

5

MR. PRESSONJ

As far as 1983, I'm not aware of

6

any until this one, although I suppose there could have

7

been some actions against municipalities or other

8

governmental units that I might not be aware of.

9

I think the need for a more explicit standard

10

is not only to enhance the deterrence aspect of 1983,

11

but it is even more important to limit what this Court

12

has indicated is the possible abuse of punitive damages,

13

which as this Court has indicated are not designed to

the Court has indicated that they are subject to severe

perhaps more consistently understandable, might

eliminate or at least reduce the possibility for abuse.

Unfortunately, in this day and
Sut I think

18

1

An alternative argument is that if 1583 in all

2

instances does not require an actual malica showing, I

3

think it does in this instance, simply because as a

4

general procedural or philosophical matter the courts

5

always talk in terms of punitive damages being available

6

for aggravating circumstances.

7

the term "aggravating" implies a comparative analysis,

8

two different levels of conduct, one being higher than

9

the other.

10

I think the very use of

As I stated earlier, the level of conduct in

11

this case and applied as it is by qualified immunity was

12

placed there for a very specific societal reason, and it

13

was placed there because often the risks of not doing

14

something are just as great as actually acting, and that

15

the risk of error under those circumstances deserves

16

some protection in making an informed decision.

17

I think it would undermine that policy if

18

anything less than actual malice were to be implied.

I

19

also believe it would be inconsistent with this Court's

20

opinion in Carey.

21

you could not presume damages, even assuming proof of a

22

constitutional violation.

23

me we would simply be reaching the same result here by

24

simply saying, well, they're punitive damages and not

25

presumed damages.

In Carey this Court indicated that

That being true, it seems to

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

But in either instance! Plaintiff is saying

2

they should both — or the punitive damages should be on

3

the same level or the same standard of liability as the

4

actual damages.

5

damages is neither one tied to the theory of

6

compensation or to the extent of any actual injury.

7

And yet! presumed damages or punitive

It mould seem to be that to award punitive

8

damages on the same standard of conduct as that for the

9

basic liability gets around and reaches the same result

10

which was closed off in this Court's opinion in Carey.

11

I believe! therefore! that both the policy of deterrence

12

would neither be inhibited — because compensatory and

13

the threat of attorney's fees in themselves carry with

14

it a deterrent effect! as this Court has noted on

15

previous occasions.

16

To the extent that any further deterrence is

17

appropriate under 1983! I think it is best served by as

18

explicit a standard as possible! and I say that because!

19

unlike either the attorney's fees or the compensatory

20

damages! which are inherently limited by actual costs or

21

actual damages! as this Court has noted on many

22

occasions! punitive damages have no such inherent

23

restriction and are essentially unlimited.

MR. LOCKENVITZ*

I believe malicious intent

can be implied by a callous disregard of known threats

The common law I was referring to refers to a

an extraordinary case in that the standard that me had

believe this Court would in effect be taking away the

17

draw the Court's attention to a hypothetical.

18

facts of this case show that Elijah Smith» with the same

19

guard on duty in the same dormitory» with somewhat

20

similar circumstances» was beaten to death only a few

21

months before this happened» if on the night that Danny

22

Wade was raped and beaten he would have been killed» his

would have been limited to what he could have provided

outside the prison.

5

And it's unrealistic to suppose an

3ut without actual damages there would be no

6

real deterrence for these guards.

comes a time — or I mean* substantial actual damages.

8

There comes a time when actual damages can be so low*

9

the possibility of them can be so low, that a guard or

In other words* there

10

someone else in that position may deciae to take the

11

risk.

12

In other words, it would be cheaper for him to

pay the actual damages and violate the constitutional

14

rights than it would be for him to apply some new policy

15

or make a more careful decision* or in this case place

16

Danny Wade in a cell downstairs with only one other

17

inmate who is from the special treatment unit rather

18

than in a cell with two inmates who had come from the

general population.

20

QUESTION;

Don't you think as a practical

21

matter all of these officials expect the state to pay

22

any judgment against them anyway?

23

MR. LOCKENVITZ.

I suppose these individuals

24

expect that.

25

there's a real question as to the punitive damage aspect

However, I agree with Mr. Presson that

of this case

QUESTION:

You wouldn't expect to collect

3

punitive damages in any substantial amount from a prison

4

guard» would you really?

5

MR. LOCKENVITZ:

No, Your Honor.

And you

6

know, it's interesting in this case, the fact that the

7

tcrt defense fund was available was brought out in trial

8

in a remark made by the defense counsel.

9

jury, knowing that there's some type of insurance back

10

there, realized the role of punitive damages and these

11

good Missouri folks decided that $5,000 was adequate to

12

punish or deter this guard from similar conduct in the

13

future.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

And yet, this

Would the court have permitted you

to bring that fact out?
MR. LOCKENVITZ:

The court would have.

I did

17

not — well, they would have permitted me to do that

18

after the remark by the defense counsel.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. LOCKENVITZ:

21

22

Prior to that, would the court —
Prior to that, no, the court

would not have.
Your Honor — Your Honors, ordinarily actual

23

damages would be enough.

But with the hypothetical that

24

I've just presented to you and the deterrence policy

25

that we're talking about here, I believe in 1S83 cases

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the door should be left open.

2

When you take a look at the legislative

3

history — and again» as this Court has pointed out»

4

there is no indication that — damages mere not

5

discussed in the debates.

6

in the debates before the Act of 1871 and its

7

precedessor in 1866 the problem of state officials

8

turning their backs on the rights of innocent citizens.

9

And it is my belief that this concern» along with the

3ut I saw time and time again

10

common lam that existed at the time» must be read in

11

such a way that they intended for punitive damages to be

12

available.

13

And again» the damages were not actually

14

discussed» at least where I could find it» in the

15

legislative debates» but the policy of deterrence

16

certainly was» and the policy of deterrence in civil

17

rights actions» of course» has been mentioned by this

18

Court time and time again.

19

Your Honors» again I want to perhaps clarify

20

something and distinguish this case from Carey.

In

21

Carey the Plaintiff had to show that he was deprived of

22

a right under color of law.

23

that they knew or should have known that his right was

24

being violated.

25

because he had no actuals» he had to show some sort of

He had to show negligence»

And then to reach punitive damages»

2

or reckless disregard.

3

Here, instead of a three-step process* because

4

of the particular qualified immunity for prison

5

officials we had to show a deprivation of a

6

constitutional right.

7

immunity we had tc show that this deprivation occurred

8

because of a callous indifference, an egregious failure,

9

if you will, a deliberate indifference to known threats

10

But because of the qualified

to health and safety, recklessness.

11

In other words, we met that punitive damage

12

standard as soon as we met the standard for actual

damages.

that the state imposed this burden on itself.

deprive Danny Wade and others like him of punitive

prison officials to take the easy way out» and if the

actual damages happen to be low — obviously, they can't

to take the easy way out and pay rather than face the

Is that instruction 5 in Missouri

MR. LOCKENVITZ;

Instruction 5 is -- not

I might add» though» that he did not, as you

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT PRESSON, ESQ.

22

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

23

MR. PRESSONS

The Respondent has gotten a

24

little bit into the facts of the case, and I don't want

25

tc dwell on them too much, but I do feel that a brief

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

response on my part would be appropriate.

2

the Respondent's characterization of placing a lamb in

3

with two lions» his reference to what one guard called a

4

common sense rule about not putting a protective custody

5

inmate in with those from general population, are not

6

the sole — are not the complete picture in this case.

7

First of all»

The Plaintiff was in the administrative

8

segregation unit because of conduct violations in the

9

protective custody unit to begin with.

In other words»

10

once he had requested to get into protective custody he

11

was then charged himself with harassing and threatening

12

inmates in that unit, and that was the disciplinary

13

charge that got him into administrative segregation.

14

As far as the death of the other inmate a few

15

months previous, on which this same guard did happen to

16

be on duty at the time, again there is nothing in the

17

record to indicate that was a result of any personal

18

fault of that guard.

19

were only two inmates in the cell.

20

shower period, when there were two guards but both of

21

them happened to be supervising the inmates during their

22

shower period because the inmates were obviously out of

23

the cell at that time.

24
25

It took place at a time when there
It took place during

In other words, there was no indication that
this had any rational connection between the later

1

2

events involving the Plaintiff here.
It seems to me, Your Honor, that the

3

Plaintiff's then argument that low damages would

4

encourage someone to take a chance is really

5

unsupportable.

6

dealt with a Louisiana statute on survivorship under

7

which certain actions might abate, and the argument was

8

made, well, this would undermine deterrence.

9

wcrds, they could say, well, this might abate, I'll take

10
11

In Robertson versus Wegmann this Court

In other

the chance.
This Court rejected that as an unlikely

12

possibility and I think it's ecually unlikely that a

13

state official would sit around and say, well, I

14

consider damages unlikely here in any great amount, I'll

15

take a chance.

16

I don't believe that this Court can indulge the

17

assumption that that would happen.

18

That is just too iffy a proposition and

It appears to me in the final analysis that

19

what we want to ensure is a most appropriate imposition

20

of punitive damages, and I think a higher standard is

21

conducive with that.

22

what this Court said in Santosky versus Kramer, that a

23

higher standard of proof ensures or places the

24

fact-finder on notice that this is an important decision

25

and helps to limit the possibility of an inappropriate

And I think it is analogous to
