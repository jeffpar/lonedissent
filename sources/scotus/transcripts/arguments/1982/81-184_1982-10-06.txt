ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAR I. HOROWITZ, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

8

MR. HOROWITZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

9 and may it please the Court:

10

The issue before the Court here is whether the

11 invocation by the various debtors in these consolidated

12 cases of Section 522(f)(2)

of the new Bankruptcy Code

13 violates the Fifth Amendment.
14

Using as an example the cases of one of these

15 debtors, the relevant facts are as follows.
16 14,

On April

1978, Richard and Sharon Hunter took out a small

17 loan from appellee Beneficial Finance Company.

18 total amount financed was $2,459.

The

The Hunters executed

19 a printed security agreement in connection with this

20 loan in which by the typing of an X in the appropriate
21 box they pledged as security for the loan, and I quote,

22 "all household goods, excluding motor vehicles but
23 including household furniture, television sets,
24 electrical appliances, stereo phonographs, furnishings,
25 carpets, draperies, chinaware and other household goods

3

of every kind owned by them and located in or about

2

their residence."

3

30ESTI0Ns

Does it include after-acquired

4 property?
HR. HDRDHITZ;

5
6

property, and I believe it includes after-acquired

7 property.

I’m not sure.
The Hunters estimated the replacement value of

8
9

It includes substitutes for the

these goods — that is, the value that it would — the

10

amount that it would cost them to go out and acquire the

11

goods again — at $2,500, approximately the value of the

12 loan.

They retained possession of all of these goods.

13 Hone of them were turned over to the finance company as
14 a pledge.
15

Shortly after the entry of this loan in

16 November 1978 the President signed into law the
17

Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 which became effective

18 almost a year later on October the 1st, 1979.

Some time

19

after that October 1979 date when the Act became

20

effective, which is about one — at least one and a half

21

years after the loan was entered into — the Hunters,

22

unable to pay their debts, filed a petition and

23

bankruptcy.

24
25

To prevent Beneficial Finance from seizing all
of their household goods pursuant to this boilerplate

1 security agreement, the Hunters invoked Section
2 522(f)(2) of the new Bankruptcy Code to avoid the fixing
3 of a lien on those goods that came within the debtors’
4 exemptions provided by the Code.
5

Now, to briefly explain the operation of

6 Section 522(f)(2), it is a limited provision enacted by
7 Congress that is an integral part of Congress* reform
8 that was specifically directed at the specific problems
9 of consumer debtors.
10

QUESTION*

Kuch like the Fraser-Lempke Act?

11

MR. HOROWITZs

Very different from the

12 Fraser-Lempke Act, Justice Rehnquist.
.13

The Fraser-Lempke

Act was a one-time bailout of the farmers there who were

14

unable to continue paying the mortgages on their farms

15

because of the Depression.

But there was no real

16 amendment of the Bankruptcy Code there.

In fact, the

17

amendment in the Fraser-Lempke Act was retroactive

18

only.

19

mortgages that were entered into.

It would have had no effect at all on future
The law remained the

20 same.
21

Here there was a wholesale change essentially

22 in the Bankruptcy Code, and this was a provision set up
23

for the way the new Bankruptcy Code would operate.

The

24

issue in this case is sort of the incidental effect of

25

that change in the Code as it applies to security
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

interests that were entered into before the act was

2 passed .

3

In order to guarantee bankrupt debtors a fresh

4 start, which this Court has repeatedly recognized as one
5 of the key reasons for bankruptcy, Congress established
6 a set of federal exemptions with specific dollar

7 limitations on certain goods that if deemed to be
8 necessary for the debtors to continue after bankruptcy

9 -- items such as household goods, tools of the debtor's
10 trade, and the home.

Congress found, however, that similar

11

12 exemptions in the past provided under state law had

13 proven ineffective in guaranteeing the debtors this
14 fresh start because, as in this case, consumer finance
15 companies had obtained blanket liens in all the debtor’s
16 household goods, thus enabling these creditors to levy
17 on the exempt property or to use the threat of
18 repossession of the exempt property to compel the debtor
19 to reaffirm the debt after bankruptcy.
To safeguard these exemptions and make them

20
21

effective, Congress enacted Section 522(f)(2) which

22 enables the debtor in the bankruptcy proceeding to avoid

23 the fixing of the liens on certain of the exempt
24 property.
25

This avoidance provision is fairly limited.
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

It applies only to certain kinds of liens --

2 nonpossessory, nonpurchase money, security interests.
3 It applies to only certain categories of the exemptions
4 that were provided by Congress* for example, liens on
5 motor vehicles or liens on a home are not included
6 within the avoidance provision.

And finally it is

7 limited by the dollar limitations on the value of the
8 exempt property.

Valuable property cannot be subject to

9 avoidance under these provisions.
10

This is the provision that the Hunters invoked

11 enabling them to emerge from bankruptcy in unencumbered
12 possession of their furniture, silverware and other
13 household goods.

And the appellees challenged the

14 Hunter's invocation of this section as violative of the
15 Fifth Amendment.
16

Now, despite the fact that the Court of

17 Appeals found — did not challenge the Congress — the
18 need for this legislation and the fact that it was
19 important to achieve the congressional purposes, the
20 court found that the application to the security
21 interest involved in this case in fact violated the
22 Fifth Amendment.

The Court of Appeals relied

23 exclusively on this Court's decision in Louisville Joint
24 Stock Land Bank v. Radford, decided in 1935, and it felt
25 itself bound by that decision.

1

QUESTION;

Mr. Horowitz, I suppose the problem

2 of the Fifth Amendment question could have been avoided

3 if it had been determined that the provision was not
4 intended to be retroactive, right?
5

MR. HOROWITZ;

6

QUESTION;

Yeah.

Well, one of the —

What leads — what leads you to

7 believe that Congress intended retroactive application
8 of this section?

9

MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, there’s nothing at all in

10

the legislative history in the statute that suggests

11

that tha saction wouldn’t be retroactive.

12

whole seems to apply retroactively.

The act as a

There’s a savings

13 clause that makes clear that bankruptcy proceedings that
14 were begun before the effective date of tha act are to
15 be decided under the old act; that all bankruptcy
16 proceedings commenced after October 1979 are to be heard
17 under the provisions of the new act.

There’s no special

18 exception for any provisions of the act, and it wouldn’t
19 make any sense for Congress — it would just leave a gap
20 essentially in the statute.
21

There would be no law to

apply if the new law didn’t apply.

22

Now, the Court of Appeals rejected this, this

23 contention.
24 it.

They also found there was no evidence for

The appellees have briefly argued that the statute

25 should be read to be not retroactive; but they’re also
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

unable to find anything directive of Section 522(f).

2 Essentially

their position is that the entire Bankruptcy

3 Code should not be applied to any security interests or
4 any other claims that arose before the enactment date of
5 the act.

ftnd that would just leave chaos essentially.

6 It would postpone the effective date of the act for

7 years.

many

And there's just simply no evidence of that.
So I think we’re pretty much stuck with the

8

9 fact that Congress made the statute retroactive/ and
10 we'll have to address the constitutional question.

QUESTION;

11

Is the exemption -- is the amount

12 that’s involved -- isn't the exemption limited to $200?

13

HR. HOROWITZ;

14

QUESTION;

15

HR. HOROWITZ;

16 item.

Well, i-t's limited to $200 in —

With respect to household goods?
Yeah.

Well, $200 in each

So it’s conceivable that the total can be more

17 than $200.
18

QUESTION;

19

HR. HOROWITZ;

20

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

21

As to each item.
Yeah.
On quite a large house

if that's the application, you could have quite a large

22 exemption -- one of the Rockefeller homes,

for example.

23 Two hundred for each item is —
24

MR. HOROWITZ;

Any household good is exempt up

25 to a value of $200 on that item.

The idea of the

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

exemptions is that these items aren't really — used

2 silverware,

used chairs, things like that don't have

3 much of a resale value; they're not worth very much to
4 other parties.

They are worth something to the debtor

5 who has to go out and replace them.

I think $200 was

6 meant to make sure that real luxury items that were

7 worth a lot of money didn't come in under this
8 exemption.

So if you have, for example, an expensive

9 stereo, that would be worth more than $200, and that
10 wouldn't be exempt;
11

under that.

but most items probably will fall

And the idea is for the debtor to be able

12 to retain essentially his living room furniture and his

13 bedroom furniture, things like that.

If the $200 is an

14 aggregate, probably everything -- most people own a
15 total of things that are worth more than $200.
16

The reasoning of the Court of Appeals is that

17 these blanket security interests in household goods must
18 be characterized as property under the Fifth Amendment,
19 and hence, avoidance of these security interests under
20 Section

522(f) necessarily must be a taking without just

21 compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment.
22

But this superficial analysis utterly fails to

23 address the peculiar nature of the property interest
24 that is involved here, and it is only on that property
25 interest that Congress narrowly and exclusively focused
10

1
2

its attention
Unlike the traditional type of property

3 interest, and certainly unlike the real estate mortgage
4 that was involved in Radford, the creditor here has no
5 interest in actual physical possession of the subject
6 property or in applying that property to satisfy the
7 debt, even if the debtor defaults.
8

Congress found that the used household goods

9 secured by these blanket liens are generally of
10 negligible resale value such that it does not pay for
11 the creditor to physically repossess them.

Rather, the

12 value of the liens to the -13

QUESTIO»s

Well, the bankrupt should never

14 worry then.
15

MR. HOROWITZs

Well, he has to worry because

16 the creditor can use it as a lever in order for him to
17 pay his debt.
18

QUESTIONi

Oh, no.

19

MR. HOROWITZS

20

QUESTIONS

That's one --

If it's true, if he -- all he'd

21 have to know is what Congress' finding was, that there
22 was no interest in repossessing.
23

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, Congress' finding is that

24 it's not worth it in dollar terms.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. HOROWITZ, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT -- Resumed

6

MR. HOROWITZs

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

7 and may it please the Courts
8

Before the break I was discussing the

9 congressional finiings here that the used household
10 goods secured by these liens are in fact of no resale
11 value, and therefore, the creditor has no interest in
12 possession of them.

Rather, the value of the liens to

13 the creditor is when the property remains in the
14 possession of the debtor.

It is the threat of

15 repossession of the goods which gives the debtor a
16 powerful incentive to agree to various demands of the
17 creditor — for example, to reaffirm the debt -- that
18 provides the creditor’s interest in the lien, because
19 the replacement value of these goods to the debtor is so
20 high that he cannot afford to have them repossessed.
21

Justice White asked me whether in fact the

22 individual debtor didn’t ceally have to worry about this
23 because of the congressional findings, but, of course, I
24 think the debtor is in no position to call the
25 creditor’s bluff and —

1

QUESTION;

But I think that there are

2 repossessions in —
3

HR. HOROWITZ;

4

QUESTION;

Well, there certainly —

— In enough cases to make the

5 threat real.
6

NR. HOROWITZ;

Thera certainly would be

7 repossessions just for the very sake of making the
8 threat credible.
9

QUESTION;

Well, and not only that but they

10 repossess them when their debt isn't vary much.
11
12 the debt.
13

NR. HOROWITZ;

When it's not — to reaffirm

That can happen, yes, sir.
QUESTION;

They can collect their ?600 by

14 repossessing the household goods, and they do.
15

NR. HOROWITZ;

Well, depending on how much the

16 transaction costs are for having to repossess the items
17 and hold a garage sale to sell them.
18 the creditor's while.

It may be worth

In the vast majority of cases

19 they're used as a threat.
20

QUESTION;

Hr. Horowitz, is there anything

21 illegitimate about using iiens to encourage payment, and
22 isn't that really the normal function of a lien?
23

HR. HOROWITZ:

24 illegitimate about it.

Well, there's certainly nothing
It's one of the normal functions

25 of a lien, most liens, most security interests, at least
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the kind that this Court has dealt with in the past.
2 And takings cases have a second purpose, and that is
3 that the creditor takes the security with the
4 expectation that he will take the collateral in lieu of
5 the debt if in fact there's default on the debt.

That

6 was certainly the case in Hadford.
7

That aspect is absent here.

Here the

8 creditor, for example, does not value the property in
9 determining how much money he's going to lend to the
10 debtor.

That's really irrelevant to it.

11 at the debtor's income prospects.

He just looks

And so you have cases

12 like this one in fact that I mentioned with the Hunters
13 where the amount of the loan at the beginning is in fact
14 in excess of the value of the collateral.
15

Now, this —

16

QUESTION*

Well, that may make it a poor loan,

17 but that doesn't mean that the people might not want to
18 foreclose the security and get what they could out of
19 it, even though it doesn't pay off the debt.
20

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, but in fact the goods are

21 of such negligible value that it's usually just not
22 worth the creditor's while to foreclose.

There may be

23 exceptions, but it's usually not worth his while to try
24 to collect these goods and have a fire sale and try to
25 get $25 or whatever they're worth.

1

Now

2

QUESTION:

Nr. Horowitz, does the term

3 "appliance'* in this section include refrigerators, deep
4 freezers, television sets, video equipment?
5

MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, it hasn't really been

6 litigated in this case as to exactly what items are

7 covered by that definition.
8

QUESTION:

9

MR. HOROWITZ:

It's a little broad.

Is there any reason to think —
I think "appliances" certainly

10

was meant to cover things like refrigerators and

11

dryers.

12 TV

TV sets -- many courts have held, I think, that

sets are covered by that language.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. HOROWITZ;

15

QUESTION:

Are covered?
Yes.

But you wouldn't suggest, would

16 you, or have you already said that you regarded them as
17 having little value on resale?
MR. HOROWITZ:

18

Well, it varies.

As I said,

19 there is this limitation of $200 all together; that this
20 section wouldn’t even cover if

21

there was, in fact — so

the goods by definition here have a resale value of less

22 than $200.

23

Now, you could have a case where the debtor

24 had a lot of goods that were worth $199, and it might be
25 worth it for the creditor to go in.
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION:

It isn't right that the good has a

2 value of lass than $200, just that the interest involved

3 is only to the extent of $200.

You could have a $500

4 refrigerator, but the exemption would only cover $200.
5

MR. HOROWITZ:

That's right.

6 had a $500 refrigerator, then I

7 could use Section 522(f)(2)

And then if you

don't think the debtor

to protect against the

8 creditor repossessing the refrigerator because —

9

QUESTION*

He'd just get $200 out of the

10 proceeds of resale.
11

MR. HOROWITZ*

I think that's right, yes.

12

Mow, getting back to what Justice O'Connor

13 asked me, it is true that the security interest here is
14 as a means of — is to encourage the debtor to repay his
15 debt, and that is a legitimate purpose of a security
16 interest.
17

But what you have here because -QUESTION:

Well, he -- excuse me.

He would

18 use his — he would use his — he uses the section.

If

19 he gets $200 back, he uses the section, because the lien
20 then is removed from the $200.
21

MR. HOROWITZ*

Yeah, exactly.

But it doesn't

22

23

QUESTION*

Provided he — or if they repossess

24 a television set, the lien would give them the $500 if
25 it's worth $500.

But he -17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. HOROWITZ:

Right.

That would reduce the

2 value of the security interest.

3

QUESTION :

4

MR. HOROWITZ:

5

QUESTION:

Exactly.
But it doesn't completely —

Well, it reduces it by enough to

6 get it down to $200.

It protects $200 worth of interest

7 in the television set.
8

MR. HOROWITZ:

Right.

But the argument that's

9 been made hare by the Tenth Circuit and by the appellees
10 is that there's no value left to the security interest
11
12

at all, and that's in fact not true.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose when Congress

13 enacted these provisions they had some information about
14 the average secondhand value of most household items and
15 then arrived at this $200 figure.
16

MR. HOROWITZ:

Yeah.

Well, they did.

There

17 was a study done by the FTC which investigated these
18 kind of practices and found that usually it was not — I
19 think the $200 figure, I don't know if that was based on
20 a study or just on Congress'
21

perception of what it was

fair to leave the debtor with and what would be a luxury

22 item otherwise.

23

I think what is significant about these

24 security interests is that their only use is as a means
25 of compelling the debtor to repay, and therefore, you
18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

don't really have an independent property interest here,

2 as the Tenth Circuit found; but the security interest
3 here cannot as a practical matter be separated from the
4 debtor's personal obligation.

Now, of course, the creditor ordinarily has a

5
6

right to have the debtor satisfy his personal

7 obligation.

But here you have a debtor in bankruptcy,

8 and the whole point of bankruptcy is to discharge the
9 debtor's personal obligation and
10 fresh start
11

to allow him to have a

unencumbered by prior debt.

So the question

here is why should these debtors who have the security

12 interests but that

are in fact are no different from the

13 personal obligation,
14 position than

the unsecured creditor to also —

QUESTION;

15

why should they be in any better

Well, are you saying that a debtor

16 who has given a chatel mortgage on his personal property
17 the way

it happened here is no different than a debtor

18 who simply is given an unsecured obligation?

20 different,

MR. HOROWITZ;

It's not that he’s no

but for the purposes of the Fifth Amendment

21 the question is whether such a sharp

line should be

22 drawn between the kind of paper security interest that
23 you have here where in fact there's no actual interest
24 in taking the property or in reselling
25

QUESTION;

—

Well, but there is — there is a

1

property interest created under the laws of most states

2 by

that sort of security.

And for you to say that there

3 isn't really any just begs the question.

There

4 certainly is an interest.
5
6

MR. HOROWITZ*

But for the purposes of the

takings clause of the Fifth Amendment it's important to

7 focus on the type of property interest you have here.
8 think this question

is discussed well in the Seventh

9 Circuit's recent 7 to 1 en banc decision in the Gifford
10 case on this exact question.
•11

The fact is that there is very little in the

12 sense of Fifth Amendment property that is being taken

13 away from the debtor here.

What's being taken away is

14 his expectation of repayment by the debtor, and that's
15 the same thing that is always taken away in bankruptcy
16 from unsecured creditors and from everyone else.
17

QUESTION *

Mr. Horowitz, under your arguments

18 what type of destruction of liens, if any, would be
19 compensable under the Fifth Amendment takings clause?
20

MR. HOROWITZ*

21 these liens,

What kind of destruction of

these kinds —

22

QUESTION*

Of any liens, if not these.

23

MR. HOROWITZ*

Well, I mean, for example, in

24 the Armstrong case the Court held that the destruction
25 of the liens there was compensable.

And this Court —

I

QUESTION;

ME. HOROWITZ*

3 Armstrong case.

You agres with that?
Yes, I'd agree with the

This Court has said many times that

4 these takings cases have to be decided on an ad hoc
5 basis by looking at all the factors.

You have to

6 balance what the government interest was here.
7

In a case like Radford where Congress

8 essentially just passed a bailout — it wasn't part of
9 just a bankruptcy code kind of revision — you have much
10 less of a government interest in that kind of thing and
11 a commensurate lesser property interest.
12

QUESTION;

And I take it you concede that

13 under Kansas law the liens here are liens on specific
14 property.
15

MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, I would agree that

16 there's a property interest created under Kansas law by
17 these liens.

Whether they're — I disagree that they're

18 liens in specific property in the sense that this Court
19 used that term in Radford.
20

QUESTION;

Any difference under Colorado law,

21 the five Colorado cases?
22

MR. HOROWITZ;

I don't know of any difference

23 in the state laws.
24

QUESTION;

Do you know whether self-help was

25 allowed or did they have to foreclose these liens if
21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 they wanted through court?

Can't they just go and

2 repossess?
3

SR. HOROWITZ:

I think the security agreement

4 provides that —
5

QUESTION:

They just go and repossess.

They

6 drive up to the house and take the goods.
7

HR. HOROWITZ:

The debtor has to pile all the

8 furniture in his living room, I think, and make it ready
9 for them, and then they can go in.
10

Now, what happens —

11

QUESTION:

And under the laws of both states

12 that is permissible.
13

MR. HOROWITZ:

14

QUESTION;

I believe that's correct.

Well, there are some practical

15 problems in what has been described as repossessing.

It

16 isn't really repossessing because they've never had
17 possession.
18

SR. HOROWITZ:

That was addressed there.

No.

19 Repossession is used -20

QUESTION:

And this isn't like repossessing an

21 automobile which has a license number and a serial
22 number and is readily identified.

This is an amorphous

23 mass of material, some of which might belong to the
24 son-in-law or mother-in-law or what not.
25

HR. HOROWITZ;

Yeah.

Well, the debtor —

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

Does that enter into creating some

2 problems here?
3

SR. HOROWITZ:

The debtor is usually required

4 to make a list of some of the property he has, so —
5

QUESTION;

At the time --

6

SR. HOROWITZ;

I suppose -- at the time he

7 enters into the loan.
8

QUESTION;

9

MR.

-- The lien is —

HOROWITZ; Yes.

10

QUESTION;

11

MR.

At the time the lien attaches.

HOROWITZ;

Right.

The lien is not

12 restricted to that property, but that gives the creditor
13 something.
14

QUESTION;

15

MR.

16

QUESTION;

All the new property coming in.

HOROWITZ; Yes.
But there are some practical

17 problems with respect to the after-acquired property,
18 aren't there ?
19

MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, I'm not sure how the

20 after-acquired property is handled under the laws of
21 these various states.

There could be litigation, I

22 suppose, over whether particular property is covered by
23 the lien.

But on the other hand, the language I read

24 from the lien says all property in a house, so that well
25 may cover all after-acquired property.
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

I think the real defect in the Court of

2 Appeals’ reasoning here is that it simply found that
3 because these liens could be construed as a property
4 interest and because their value is undoubtedly impaired
5 by the invocation of Section 522(f), the court concluded
6 that there must be a taking here; that in fact the court
7 has repeatedly recognized in recent years -- the Penn
8 Central case, for example

that you have to look at

9 both the investment-backed expectations of the creditor
10 and the nature of the government action to determine
11 whether there is a taking.
12

Since my time is short, I think I’ll refer to

13 the brief pretty much for that statement.

But I think

14 if you look at the Penn Central test, there is in fact
15 -- in view of the limited expectation of the creditors
16 here there is in fact no taking.
17

I’d like to reserve the remainder of my time.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

19

URAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY F. FIELD, ESQ.,

20

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

21

MR. FIELD;

Mr. Field.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

22 please the Court;
23

He have two grounds that we are presenting

24 today upon which we believe the judgment below should be
25 affirmed, and I’d like to discuss them in turn.

The

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

first ground is that the 1978 Bankruptcy Act may not be

2 applied in

this situation because of its

3 unconstitutionality, because of the integral nature of
4 the judiciary provisions which have been held
5 unconstitutional already.
6

I will address that after we

first respond to the Government with respect to the

7 retroactive application of 522(f).
8

As this Court noted in the questionings of the

9 Government,

the real vice here is not whether Congress

10 can decide for
11

the future that the policy of the federal

government in bankruptcy will be that certain kinds of

12 interests are or are not protectable.

The question is

13 whether Congress or committees of Congress or testimony
14 before Congress can be used to decide whether the
15 transaction in existence at that time between A and B is
16 in fact void because unconscionable, because a subject
17 of overreaching, because the interest was only used for
18 threat purposes, et cetera — whatever the
19 justifications are.
20
21

The real vice in this statute is that it
usurps the judicial function of deciding cases between

22 existing parties and decides as a matter of legislative

23 policy, at least as interpreted by the Solicitor
24 General, that A's contract with B was unconscionable.
25

Now, in the record of this case before this
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Court there's not a trace of suggestion that these

2 transactions are in fact unconscionable, the subject of
3

overreaching, the property is hell by these creditors

4

only for threat purposes, et cetera.
I think eaqh of these justifications would be,

5

6 as we pointed out,
7

true — at least the threat

justification — true with respect to all creditors.

As

8 Justice O'Connor has pointed out, there is no
9

difference.

And the principle upon which the Government

10

is urging this Court to destroy or permit the

11

destruction retroactively of vested property rights

12 admits of no real distinction between myself here -13

QUESTION:

-Well, the Government's position

14 just isn't threats or overreaching or anything.
15 saying that whatever interest a
16 minimis in the property;
17 They have a lien,
18 worth anything.

but it's a paper lien.

It's just not

At least it can't be worth enough to be

19 called a taking.

QUESTION*

I think that's —
It's just — it's just — has no

22 substance.

MR. FIELD*

I think that's their argument.

24 Your Honor.
25

QUESTION*

Yeah.

1

MR. FIELDS

However, it's patently false

2 because — and although, again,

it might be permissible

3

to make that judgment in the future,'that’s certainly

4

not true of the cases that are before this Court, and

5

it’s certainly not true — there's no substance to any

6

such suggestion of the record here.

7

QUESTIONS

Well, if Congress — if Congress

8 viewed that — took that view about these kinds of liens
9

for the future, it certainly was a considerate judgment

10

that these kinds of liens aren't worth very much,

11

because they certainly didn't do it as to mortgages on

12

real estate.

13

MR. FIELDS

Well, that may be.

Whether it's a

14

considered judgment or not I can't tell.

15

16

to say that if Congress can make this rule for the

17

future, might well pass due process.

18

exercise of Congress' power.

19

It's a rational

But the standard and the problem before this

20 Court is not that.
21

It might pass

It’s the problem of the attack or

the destruction of the pre-existing interests which have

22 nothing — as to which those findings are irrelevant and
23

constitutionally have to be because Congress cannot

24

decide the case between A and B.

25

That's for this Court

between A and B as to whether under equitable principles

2 or state law an existing property right is or is not
3

valid.

4

The principle —

5

QUESTION;

Well, it isn’t quite correct to say

MR. FIELD;

That’s exactly correct. Your

And so —
QUESTION;

So that at the time the statute was

passed no rights were immediately affected by it.
MR. FIELD;

That’s correct.

Well, and our

14

position is that with respect to this lien voiding, no

15

rights would ever be vested —

If you’re right.

dii not construe that these interests were of that

2 character generally; that is, they chose only to abolish
3

or limit them in a small context -- that is, bankruptcy.

Well, Congress can’t legislate the

way a state legislature could in the very broad

6

context.

HR. FIELDi
QUESTION:

10

That’s correct.
It was just dealing with bankruptcy.
That’s correct.

That’s correct.

Do you think it could have changed

11

the order of priority -- I don’t know what the order of

12

priority was -- to make these junior to some claims to

which they were previously senior in the future?

it says they’ll be treated like general creditors is

SR. FIELD;

19

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

But you say they couldn’t even

20 rearrange the order of priority.
21

MR. FIELD:

22 which such a decision could be made a court; that is,

MB. FIELDi

If it resulted in the destruction

QUESTIONS

It would result in a diminution of .

6 the value of your lien.
7

MR. FIELDS

Yes.

I think that would be if the

8 result was -9

QUESTIONS

And if you take any change in the

10 order of priority it would violate the terns.
11

MR. FIELDS

Yes.

And historically this Court

12 has always interpreted such changes to be for the future
13 only for that very reason.
14

The principle that the Government urges really

15 does not permit this Court or anyone else to distinguish
16 between finance companies which are here before the
17 Court and corporate mortgage bond holders in multi,
18 multi-million dollar, billion dollar corporate
19 reorganizations, railroad reorganizations; that is, the
20 bald principle put forth by the Government is that
21 nonpossessory, nonpurchase money security interests are
22 not property interests.

And I think you have to start

23 with that, as this Court has already indicated.

You

24 start with that and where you come out is I believe
25 under the clear guidelines this Court has established
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that if it's a property interest recognized under state
2 law, it is a property interest, and that's what we have
3 here.
4

Therefore -QUESTION;

What about when Congress first

5 introduced the four-month preference period into the
6 Bankruptcy Act — was it the act of 1898? -- when a
7 property interest perfectly good under state law was
8 voidable in bankruptcy if it was incurred within four
9 months of the filing of the petition.
10

Now, that, I suppose, is an impairment to a

11 certain extent of that property.

Is there any reason

12 why Congress can't apply that retroactively?
13

SR. FIELD:

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. FIELD;

It was not done. Your Honor.
It wasn't?
No.

That was construed to apply

16 in the Auffm'ordt case that we've cited, Auffm'ordt v.
17 Rasin.

It was construed to apply prospectively —

18

QUESTION;

19

MR. FIELD;

Only prospectively.
-- To avoid the problem we're

20 talking about here.
21

So this Court and the guidelines of this Court

22 have been very clear about what is a property interest,
23 and the Government’s argument in that regard flies smack
24 in the face of uncontradicted cases and opinions by this
25 Court -- you ran tick them off:

the Radford case, the

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Armstrong case, many other case, the General Motors case
2 -- where liens were upheld
3

So the fact that this is a nonpurchase money,

4 nonpossessory lien is irrelevant.
5 liens.
6

Those are most

The only exception perhaps is a pledge.
QUESTION;

You're going to comment on Penn

7 Central.
8

MR. FIELD;

Penn Central.

The Penn Central

9 case, the Grand Central Station case, is — was urged as
10 a taking in that case.

The Court held that it was not a

11 taking because although the highest — perhaps the
12 highest use of that property was restricted , the owner
13 of that property was nonetheless able to gain a very
14 substantial return, the historical return, and could in
15 fact have built a 50-story building on that property if
16 he was able to pass through the Commission.
17

I don't believe the Penn Central case in any

18 way suggests that — any analogy here.

It poses an

19 interesting counterpoint between a regulatory act and
20 what you have here which is a total destruction.

In the

21 Penn Central case they said you have to be careful about
22 how you build 50-story buildings in New York.

They took

23 a strand out of the bundle of rights, and this Court
24 upheld that action on that ground.
25

QUESTION;

So it's a matter of degree.
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

SR. FIELDS

No, not completely.

2 you have here is a different concept.

I think, what

You've got a lien

3 that's on the goods, and in this case the goods are all
4 specific items which are, if the lien is upheld, the
5 value of those items resorts to the creditor; if the
6 lien is not upheld, it completely eliminates — it's

7 completely eliminated.
8 of a degree.

So that it's not a question here

There is either a lien which is valid and

9 a creditor gets security and value for the security that
10 he held,

or the lien is invalid and the creditor gets

11 nothing.
12

QUESTION;

Well, that's not true, is it, if

13 the items are worth more than the £200?
14

HR. FIELD*

Well, that's true. Your Honor, in

15 -- I was referring only to the cases before this Court.
16 It is certainly conceivable, as Justice White pointed
17 out earlier, that you'll have cases where the property
18 is worth more than the lien, and therefore you'd have a
19 voiding of the lien only in part.
20

QUESTION:

However —

There would be a voiding of the

21 lien.

22

MR. FIELD:

Yes.

And — and with respect to

23 that part, the lien voiding is total; that is, it's
24 unlike Penn Central in the sense that where Penn Central
25 could nonetheless build a 50-story building, to the
33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 extent of the destruction here, the destruction is —

to

2 the extent of the lien voiding, the destruction is
3 total.

There is nothing left.

4 for the owner of the property.

There is no strands left
It's not like a

5 regulation where one of the strands is removed.
6 no strand left at all.

There's

It's a different concept, and in

7 that sense it's even further than the Loretto case. Gene
8 Loretto's case this Court had just before the break in
9 the term, where in a much less dramatic fashion the
10 cable TV company was allowed to intrude onto the
11 physical property.
12

In this case — in a limited extent, and that

13 was deemed a taking without further reference to
14 purported justifications.

In this case you have a more

15 dramatic, more extreme situation.

You've got, to the

16 extent of the lien, the property affected by the statute
17 is totally destroyed.

It’s not just that somebody can

18 put -- can restrain our interest, can prevent us from
19-selling under certain circumstances, can otherwise
20 regulate our conduct.
21

QUESTION!

We have no property.
Mr. Field, if the fluffm'ordt case,

22 which you mentioned or implied by a question I asked, is
23 rightly decided, that sounds like it's fairly good
24 precedent for saying that an act like this applies only
25 prospectively, and that you pick out simply a section of
34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the act that may raise these kind of problems and say it

2 applies only prospectively.

3

MR. FIELD:

QUESTION:

5

SR. FIELD:

I think that’s true, Your Honor.
But do you make that argument?
Yes.

We affirm that argument.

7

QUESTION:

You don't really cover it in your

8 brief.

9

SR. FIELD:

I think that’s correct, but that

10 »13 the argument male,
11

and it has been an argument we

have made, and we do affirm it in this' case.

12 believe that it is possible

We do

to do that; that is, that

13 the constitutional problem of retroactivity could be
14 avoided by construing this section to only apply to the
15 future.
16 that.

There’s support in the legislative history for
We’ve cited that in our brief.

And the normal

18 to operate to effectuate the results.

Is there also some support in the

Section 522(f)

itself where it says that the

debtor may avoid the fixing of a lien on an interest of

24 entitled under subsection (b) by saying he wouldn’t have
25 been entitled to an exemption prior to the effective

I myself have never really been happy or able to

that way.
In any event, what we have here is, I would

of its regulation cases, including the case that Justice

Blackmun suggested.

when you come to the bottom line, the Constitution

protects all liens, all property interests that are

recognized by state law.

The Government has made it

But

Now, there’s no dollar sign on the Fifth

20 Amendment.
21

We’ve got really a simple problem,

This Court has reaffirmed that many times.

So that the de minimis aspect of this situation is not

22 really relevant.

Whether it’s de minimis or not to the

Congress that there’s hardly ever a repossession, and

7 hence, the property interest is just de minimis?
8

MR. FIELD;

That, again, could be a point for

9 the future, but how they can say that could possibly
10 bear on or be relevant
11

to A*s interest — does A get a

chance to testify to the contrary?

They were —

Well, do you think congressional

15 judgment is infirm, that there’s hardly ever a
16 repossession on this kind of a lien, and hence, it's of
17 negligible value?
18

Is that judgment just wrong?

SR. FIELD;

Yes.

I think that — well, in my

Well, I don’t know.

I think it —

24 I think that — that it is before the Court.

MR. FIELD;

Okay.

judgment has to be looked at a little differently than

2 tha taking question I would see as being a retroactive
3 aspect.
4

QUESTION;

You do agree that you’re entitled

5 to win even if the Congress is quite right just because
6 you have a property interest, pure and simple, whether
7 you use it or not.

15 interest, and it would be shocking, and it really
16 creates an irrebuttable presumption of a past fact; that
17 is, that you, the litigant, don't want to do something,
18 but you don’t have -- you're deprived of your
19 opportunity to say otherwise.
20

The second ground on which we would urge this

21 Court to considar affirming tha case balow is that the
22 Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 was constructed with an
23 infirm centerpiece, as this Court has recognized in the
24 Northern Pipeline decision, and that because of this,
25 the bankruptcy courts, which were the sole courts
38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.'C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 intends:! and designed to administer the Bankruptcy Act,
2 may not function.

In other words, the Bankruptcy Act

3 may not be administered, and because it may not be
4 administered, what happens is that no court can
5 administer the 1978 act, and there is no way that those
6 provisions can be —
7

QUESTIONS

Do you read that as the Court’s

8 holding in Northern Pipeline?
9

SR. FIELD*

No, Your Honor.

The Court's

10 holding in Northern Pipeline was limited to the fact
11 that the bankruptcy courts are unconstitutional — the
12 jurisdictional grant in the 1978 act was
13 unconstitutional in part, and it was unseverable, and
14 that unless Congress does something, that jursidictional
15 grant and the court system which is behind it in 241
16 cannot function.
17

Now, as a matter of intention and as a matter

18 of practice there's no way that the 1978 act can
19 function apart from those courts.
20

QUESTION*

Well, this kind of claim, whether

21 or not a debtor is entitled to an exemption, is
22 something that could have been clearly decided by an
23 old-fashioned referee.

It certainly wouldn't take an

24 Article III judge to decide this kind of thing.
25

SR. FIELD*

Your Honor, that — whether that's
39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 true or not

and that's true as the matter of a

2 referee under the prior art — but under the -- the
3 result of the Northern Pipeline opinion is that the
4 grant of jurisdiction is unconstitutional -- is
5 inseverable and therefore inoperative.
6 to reach in

You don't need

this case the further question of whether it

7 would be unconstitutional to — whether or not to apply
8 that in this situation because what you have is a
9 statute that no longer operates.

So the -- what the

10 result of that is is that the prior act revives to
11 govern bankruptcies.

QUESTION;

I think you read a lot more into

2 the Northern Pipeline case decision than I would have.
3

MR. FIELD;

Well, that may be, Your Honor, but

4 at the minimum the Northern Pipeline decision holds that
5 the grant of jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts is
6 inseverable and partly unconstitutional.

7 bankruptcy courts under the

Therefore, the

'78 Act cannot function.

And that raises the further guestion of well,

8

9 then,

who can and how does the bankruptcy -- how does

10 the bankruptcy system devised under that Act function?

QUESTION;

11

These, of course — these cases

12 were all decided before the Northern Pipeline case.

13 Doesn’t the case of Chico Valley Drainage District,
14 decided after the holding that the Municipal Bankruptcy
15 Act was unconstitutional, say that the fact that the law
16 was unconstitutional doesn't mean that nothing happens
17 as a result of adjudications made under it?
MR. FIELD;

18

Chico deals with the situation of

19 a closed case and under the Linkletter doctrine that
20 this Court

21

has announced, in this case our clients can

take advantage of the Northern Pipeline ruling and can

22 urge the position we urge both in this case and as

23 amicus in Northern Pipeline while other cases may not,
24 because we had presented this issue on appeal in this
25 Court at the same time, and under the Linkletter

doctrine that allows us to take advantage of that

2 rule — the ruling in that case -- for our clients.

And the effect of that is that with respect to

4 us the decision below was correctly decided, not because
5 the court below lacked jurisdiction at all.

Our position is that these liens are valid under

Me. Horowitz.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. HOROWITZ, ESQ.,

2

OR BEHALF OF APPELLANT - REBUTTAL

3
4

MR. HOROWITZi

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

I'd like to take issue with Mr. Field's

6 statement that this Court cannot distinguish between
7

different kinds of property.

Clearly this Court can and

8 must distinguish between property interest like the fee
9
10

simple and real property or mortage and real property,
and the kind of security interest that's involved here.
All of the takings cases that this Court has

11
12

decided involve making judgments by this Court as to the

13

character of the government action, the economic

14

expectations.

15

and certainly an important feature that the Court must

16

consider in these cases is the nature of the property

17

interest that hasn’t been prominent in some of the

18

Court's recent decisions because they were always

19

dealing in these cases with a traditional real property

20

interest.

21

They don't admit of a bright line rule,

Here we have this fairly negligible property

22 interest that is almost indistinguishable from the right
23

to collect on the debt, and the Court has to take that

24

into account.

25

As far as whether the lien has been totally

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 destroyed here, as the Tenth Circuit said, we have
2 discussed in our brief the fact that it really isn't,
3 and Justice Stevens has alluded to that.

I would just

4 urge the Court to compare the destruction that you have
5 here with the destruction in Anders against Allers, the
6 Eagle feathers case, and I think that you will agree
7 there is no more of a total destruction here.
8

But even assuming that there is, I think it's

9 very instructive to look at the Armstrong case, which
10 Justice O'Conner alluded to.

If you look at the Court's

11 analysis in that case, the Court quickly decided that
12 the lien involved there in fact was a compensable
13 property interest and that the lien there was totally
14 destroyed.
15

The Court then went on for several pages to

16 decide whether in fact that was a taking.

Clearly, the

17 fact that the property interest was destroyed was not
18 sufficient to show as a taking, and there they found the
19 taking only because the nature of the government action
20 was a taking of the property for the government's own
21 benefit in its entrepreneurial capacity and indeed three
22 Justices dissented on that ground.
23

So I think here you also have to look at the

24 taking analysis set out in Penn Central, and because
25 this is an ordinary government regulation like the

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 minimum wage legislation and because it does not
2 interfere with the substantial expectation of the
3 creditor.
4

QUESTION;

Well, you are really just saying

5 the lien isn't worth much.
6

MR. HOROWITZ;

That's right.

It wasn't worth

7 much as a property.
8

QUESTION;

— Eastman and Loretto or not?

The

9 lien isn't worth much.
10

MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, it's worth even less than

11 Eastman and Loretto because there you at least have a
12 real property, a traditional k.ind of property interest,
13 which was someone's possession of property. * Here you
14 have —
15

QUESTION;

This is not a lien?

A chattel

16 mortgage isn't a traditional form of a lien?
17

MR. HOROWITZ;

Not in this context, where

18 there's no expectation of possession.
19

QUESTION;

Well, but a non-possessor of

20 property interest originated about the 16th Century,
21 didn't it, in personal property?

I mean, that's no

22 brand new type of thing.
23

MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, Justice, all I can say is

24 that if there were no property interest here of course
25 we wouldn't be hare, because then there would be no

47
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 claim of a taking at all.

But I think tha Court has to

2 take into account th,e fact that the property interest is
3 weak and that it’s very hard to separate the property
4 interest here from tha debtor’s personal obligation, and
5 the fact is that the whole idea of bankruptcy is to
6 discharge the debtor’s personal obligation.
7

Now creditors’ expectations are always hurt or

8 disappointed to some extent by bankrupcty legislation
9 and actions of bankruptcy courts.

I think if you look

10 at some of the cases this Court has decided -- the Local
11 Loan versus Hunt case, for example, where there was a
12 lien in future wages that was valid under state law, and
13 the Court held those constitutional for that lien to be
14 invalidated.
15

You have to look at the nature of the lien, to

16 some extent, and the nature of the government interest.
17 I’d like —
18

QUESTION:

Let me ask you, supposing a state

19 passed a statute that invalidated liens like this
20 retroactively.

Would that be valid, in your judgment,

21 to*say we will no longer hold this kind of lien to be
22 enforceable?
23

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, I would state you have

24 the additional problem of the contract clause, which
25 forbids an/ impairment of contract by the state.

That’s

48
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 why states,

I think, can’t pass bankruptcy legislation

2 to start with.

Here you do have an impairment of the

3 property interest.

Our argument is that that impairment

4 leas not rise to the level of a Fifth Amendment taking.
5

So I think there would be a lot more problem

6 with the state.
7

QUESTION:

Would you say such a state law

8 would be invalid under the contract laws?
9

SR. HOROWITZ:

That's my immediate reaction,

10 yes.
11

QUESTION;

I don’t suppose — Congress

12 couldn’t really have thought that there never was a —
13 never was a repossession in these kinds of cases.
14

MR. HOROWITZ;

15

QUESTION;

No.

As a matter of fact, maybe out of a

16 hundred you would say — ten out of a hundred, one out
17 of ten, that is probably a repossession.

Then Congress

18 thought well, that’s not enough for the future.

But it

19 took care for the past of all of them, not only the
20 nine, but the one too.
21

MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, I mean one problem here

22 is that the creditor here is not seeking to enable to
23 use his lien entirely, and that is to be able to get the
24 debtor to reaffirm the debt — have the whole lien
25 survive.

49
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

That isn't the only use of the lien

2 in every single case.

3

It just isn't.

MR. HOROWITZ;

But in passing legislation

4 Congress has to make the general judgment as to what —
5

QUESTION:

6

MR. HOROWITZS

That may be so for the future.
Well, if it was only for the

7 future, thare would be no Fifth Amendment claim at all,
8 obviously, because there wouldn't be any taking of any

9 property if this Act was already on the books that these
10 liens could

11

be avoided.

That would just be ridiculous

to claim the Fifth Amendment', so I mean it is only the

12 retroactivity that

raises the taking question at all.

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. HOROWITZ;

I agree with you.
And I think it's necessary to

15 consider the nature of the regulation in doing so.
16

My time has expired.
