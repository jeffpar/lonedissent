CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

2

We will hear arguments

first this morning in 81-1304, on the consolidated case,

the United States Postal Service.
Mr. Segal, you may proceed whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD G. SEGAL, ESQ.,

9

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN 31-1381
MR. SEGAL;

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11

please the Court, this case involves the rate-making

12

provisions of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970,

13

which eliminated the Post Office Department and

14

transferred its functions to the United States Postal

15

Service.

16

Since the new agency was to operate the first

17

class letter monopoly as well as provide classes of mail

18

competitive with enterprises in the private sector,

19

Congress enacted unique rate-making provisions designed

20

to prevent the Postal Service from utilizing the

21

monopoly power, by overcharging first class mail users,

22

and subsidizing other classes of mail.

23

I shall discuss the statutory language which

24

seeks to effectuate this Congressional purpose by

25

requiring that the rates for each class of mail recover
3

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the costs caused by the class.

Mr. Perlman, counsel for

2

the other Petitioner, will demonstrate that the

3

legislative history confirms the plain meaning of the

4

statute.
Initially, I note a very substantial

5

6

concession made by the Postal Service in this Court.

7

The Postal Service had participated in persuading the

8

Second Circuit to rule that the Act does not require

9

long-term, but calls only for short-term costing,

10

variable costing.

By virtue of this holding, the $3

11

billion of cost which formerly had been attributed to

12

various classes of mail can now be shifted to the first

13

class mail monopoly, this by virtue of the decision.
Now, the Postal Service, in the Solicitor

14
15

General's brief in this Court, concedes that costs vary

16

with volume in the long run, and must be attributed that

17

way.

18

view, nevertheless, the language of the statute clearly

19

compels the concession, and calls for reversal of the

20

Second Circuit decision.

21

Although four Respondents still adhere to the

Despite the concession, the Postal Service

22

still improperly limits attributable costs.

The Postal

23

Service says that attributable costs are only those

24

costs that can be proven by statistics to vary with

25

changes in volume, but the language of the Act contains
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

no such limitation.

Section 3622(b)(3), and I read the

2

requisite provision, that “each class of mail or type of

3

mail service bear the direct and indirect postal costs

4

attributable to that class or type," and that is all it

5

says.

6

Congress did not use technical language.

It

7

employed as the key word "attributable," which the

8

dictionary says is caused or brought about by, and it

9

couldn't have used the more all-inclusive word, I

10

submit.

11

well, the Commission cannot stop with statistical

12

variability in looking for causal connections between

13

costs and classes of mail.

14

business, to other inferences of causation, deductive

15

analysis, logic, common sense.

16

As the District of Columbia Circuit stated so

It must go on, as does all

Section 3622(b)(3), the costing section, also

17

couples the attributable cost requirement with a

18

requirement that each class of mail must also bear that

19

portion, and I am quoting, "of all other costs

20

reasonably assignable to such class."

21

reasonably assignable section is in the costing

22

subsection makes it clear that some unattributed costs

23

must be reasonably assigned on specific cost of service

24

principles.

25

QUESTIOSi

The fact that the

What would be an example, Mr.

MR. SEGAL:

Well, for example, they have a

contingency grant, one which provides for contingencies

4

that might arise in the coming year.

5

be reasonably assigned based on the classes which cause

6

the costs that lead to the concern of the contingency.
QUESTION;

7

That one ought to

Mr. Segal, are there other causal

8

costs that don't vary either directly or indirectly with

9

the amount or weight or volume of the mail?
MR. SEGAL;

10

Yes, there are, and in our

11

judgment, for example, they will amount to about $6

12

billion, or 25 percent of all costs which will be

13

apportionable to the other eight factors in 3622.
QUESTION:

14
15

Well, generally speaking, what do

those consist of, the causal costs that don’t vary?

16

MR. SEGAL;

17

QUESTION;

18

The causal costs that don’t —
With the volume or weight or number

MR. SEGAL;

example.

How about transportation costs, in

your view?
MR. SEGAL:

Well, the transportation cost is

really an abomination as it is presently being — if it

attribute.

3

4

the vehicle must go regardless of the volume, and they

5

will attribute for the sorting and then stop, and say,

6

well, the rest of it, the truck is going anyway, and

7

therefore we don’t attribute.

18

become, by the way, the nation's largest monopoly after

AT&T, will provide $13 billion of income this year, 57

20

percent of the total revenue of the Postal Service.

21

Much of the remaining revenues from other types of mail

22

where they compete with business in the private sector,

23

the governors of the Postal Service in this very case in

24

their opinion stated, and I quote, that "the Postal

25

Service's goal is to encourage significant increases in
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

volume in an increasingly competitive market

2

situation."
That means, take just this case.

3

Although

4

they have had an enormous increase, virtually twice the

5

CPI since 1971, they ask for an increase of 33 and

6

one-third percent in the revenues of first class mail

7

and 8.3 percent for parcel post, which competes with

8

United Parcel Service and with thousands of others in

9

the industry.
So, I need not tell you how concerned those in

10
11

the industry are.
QUESTIONS

12

Hell, you don't really care about

13

what happens to first class mail, do you?

14

worried that Parcel Post will compete more effectively

15

with —

16

MR. SEGALs

You are

We are worried that the more they

17

are subsidized, Justice Rehnquist, the less they will

18

ask for money for Parcel Post.

19

subsidization, the excess of the money that they get for

20

first class, to subsidize these classes which compete,

21

and there isn't any question about that.

22

They are using the

But I might say to Your Honor, that we are not

23

the only ones concerned.

Instrumentalities of the

24

federal government are deeply concerned that the Postal

25

Service not be permitted to take advantage of its
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

enormous letter monopoly to subsidize services, as I

2

have just said, which compete.

3

year, the Department of Justice, through the Antitrust

4

Division, went to court to enjoin the Postal Service

5

from instituting an electronic mail service known as

6

ECOH, in competition with private enterprise.

Thus, within the past

The Antitrust Division took this action

7
8

because it said, and I quote, "ECOH would be subsidized

9

and would pre-empt private sector activity."
Significantly also, just two months ago, the

10
11

Committee on Government Operations of the House of

12

Representatives published a unanimous report on the same

13

new ECOH operation of the Postal Service in competition

14

with private industry, a new service.

15

finding of the House Committee ananimous;

16

current ECOH rate is not compensatory, that the Postal

17

Service has known for some time now that this is so, and

18

therefore that ECOH is being subsidized by other Postal

19

Services in violation of Section 3622(b)(3)."

That is

So that. Your Honors, we are in a situation

21
22

where Congress took very specific action.

It had

23

experienced, it knew the pressures over all the years,

24

and incidentally, from the time Parcel Post was started

25

in

1913, the ICC had — the Congress didn't even give

2

be cost oriented, they thought it was all right to

3

permit this very competitive role to be handled, and in

4

a succession of opinions, three panels of the District

5

of Columbia circuit have gradually brought under control

6

more and more this situation.

7

Now that it was all to

But the difficulty is that you have, as you

8

have read, the desire, as I have just read to you, the

9

desire of the governors to grow, to get bigger, and to

10

compete in the market, and they are competing by

11

subsidization.
In concluding, so I will have time for

12

13

rebuttal, I submit that anything but a literal

14

application of Section 3622(b)(3), as in the decisions

15

of the District of Columbia circuit, would greatly

16

increase the opportunity of the Postal Service to

17

subsidize competitive classes of mail out of excess

18

revenues of monopoly first class letter mail.

19

Certainly —

20

QUESTION;

21

Mr. Segal, may I ask you just one

question?

22

ME. SEGALi

23

QUESTION;

Yes.
Do you have — Can you give me an

24

idea of what your view of the percentage of total costs

25

that should be allocated under a proper reading of the
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

statute?

2

ME. SEGAL;

3

QUESTION;

That should be allocated?
In other words, if you just take

4

short-run variable costs, you allocate maybe 50 percent

5

of that total cost.

6

MR. SEGAL:

7

QUESTION;

8

MR. SEGAL;

9

That's right.
What is your view of the —
We would believe 75 percent, and

that 25 percent ought to be for the other eight factors

10

distributed at the discretion of the agency.

11

submit to Your Honors that certainly we would have the

12

result which I have deplored if the Second Circuit

13

decision in the Newsweek case were to be affirmed, and I

14

respectfully urge that it be reversed.

18

MR. PERLMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

point of view of the Postal Service's competitors.

21

speak for my client's customers, who are individual

non-business first class mailers.

24

its rates to meet Its revenue requirements, it

QUESTION;

1

2

What do you mean by unilaterally

increasing, Mr. Perlman?
MR. PERLMAN;

3

Well, in the Rate Commission

4

decision, the Rate Commission established a rate of

5

cents, and other rates for other classes.

6

Service put this into effect under protest, and then

7

returned the matter to the Rate Commission for

3

reconsideration.

9

position, and under the statute, the board of governors

The Postal

The Rate Commission did not change its

10

may unilaterally increase rates if revenues are not

11

sufficient.
QUESTION;

12

18

You mean unilaterally, then, the

13

board of governors acting without consent or approval of

14

the Rate Commission?
MR. PERLMAN;

15

That is correct, sir.

It

16

established the 20-cent rate for first class, a rate of

17

7.9 to 10.9 cents for third class advertising circulars,

18

depending on the degree of presortation, and a rate of 9

19

to 10 cents for Time and Newsweek., depending on the

20

weight of the particular magazine and the advertising

21

con tent.

22

Discrepancies such as this result from full

23

attribution of those costs which are borne most heavily

24

by first class mail, such as collection and sorting, and

25

treatment of other costs such as transportation, which
12

where weight and cubage or cubic volume are important
factors as institutional costs.
The problem is then compounded by using as a

starting place for applying the other eight statutory

factors a mark-up which is calculated as a percent of

attributable costs.

Well, are you suggesting that there

13

is only one way to handle these nine factors?

to be going through them and saying, this is the way to

do this, this is the way to do that.

MR. PERLMAN;

But we are just reporting it as

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

high percentage of costs far out of proportion to

2

weight, volume, or number of pieces that is placed on

3

first class mail.
QUESTIONS

4

Mr. Perlman, there is — at least I

5

understand there is a widespread and long-standing

6

popular belief that junk mail has been carried on the

7

shoulders of all the other mail, if you know what I mean

8

by the junk mail. Now, courts don't take judicial notice

9

of popular belief, because it may be mythology.

Do you

10

have any comment on whether there is an accurate

11

allocation of the cost to carry the so-called junk

12

mail?
MR. PERLMAN:

Your Honor, that is why we are

That is what we are complaining

We believe that that —
QUESTION:

Well, your attack seemed to be, or

your point seemed to be focused more on first class.
MR. PERLMAN;

Well, we believe, as Mr. Segal

19

stated, that second, third, and fourth class mail are

20

undercharged, and that the difference is made up from

21

first class.

22

rates, and we are not attacking revenue requirements, so

23

the result of that is higher rates for second, third,

24

and fourth class mail.

25

We are here urging lower first class

QUESTION;

Does your client for first class

mail have a first class mail interest?
MR. PERLMANs

2

That is correct.

My clients are

3

interested in low first class rates for first class

4

mailers.
QUESTION:

5

And Mr. Segal's clients are

6

competitors with second, third, and fourth class, I take

7

it.
MR. PERLMAN:

8
9

That’s — well, they are

competitors with fourth class mail.

10

QUESTIONi

Fourth class.

11

QUESTION:

They want high parcel post rates.

12

MR. PERLMAN:

13

QUESTIONi

That's correct.

Mr. Perlman, I was a little

14

confused as to whether you were concerned with the

15

degree of proof required presently by the Commission or

16

with the underlying concepts employed.

17

confusion as I went through the briefs in my mind about

18

whether the complaint you were making was really one

19

concerning the precision of proof of variability

20

required by the Commission, or one that went further

21

into the principles involved under the statute.
MR. PERLMAN:

22

There was some

Justice O'Connor, the two really

23

merge.

The Rate Commission has taken the position, as

24

the Postal Service has, that a cost cannot be attributed

25

if it does not vary with volume.

Now, the Rate

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Commission has used language, particularly in its early

2

decisions, which indicated that it might consider other

3

methodologies, but it never has, and in effect if you

4

cannot prove it varies with volume, it is simply treated

5

as an institutional cost.
The result is that the Postal Service, which

6

7

is really the only party able to do the variability

8

studies, has attributed a relatively small percentage of

9

the costs of operating the Postal Service.

In the early

10

proceedings, it was half.

11

Now, with long-term variable costs considered, it is up

12

around 65 percent.
QUESTIONS

13

Then dropped to 45 percent.

But perhaps that is an outgrowth of

14

their perception of the degree of proof that is required

15

more than it is a difference on what the statute

16

requires.

17

MR. PERLMAN*

Nell, I think they have

18

articulated, and the Second Circuit has certainly

19

articulated it by quoting the statement of Congressman

20

Ddall and interpreting the statute to mean only costs

21

that vary with volume.

22

we are urging the Court to apply the plain language of

23

the statute and require, as the D.C. Circuit did, all

24

reasonable inferences of cost causation, whether the

25

cost is one that varies with volume or not.

We think that is incorrect, but

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

We believe that this is what the Act requires,

2

ani I wouli like to go into a little bit why we think

3

the Act requires it.
It is very simple.

4

Direct and indirect costs,

5

the words of the statute cover all costs.

The cost is

6

either direct or it is indirect.

7

the word "attribute,” chosen by the Conference Committee

8

and came out of the Senate bill, has no technical

9

meaning.

As Sr. Segal stated,

The Postal Service attempts to counter this by

10

legislative history.

They give a definition of a

11

phrase, "costs demonstrably related," which was used by

12

the Kaple Commission, which recommended establishing the

13

Postal Service, and was used again in the House bill.

14

Now, a variety of definitions were given to

15

that phrase.

We point in our brief to the various

16

definitions.

One set of definitions clearly is the one

17

the Postal Service is relying on, but other definitions

18

were used.

19

Service is correct, that that meaning of the House words

20

and the House bill had a technical meaning, the

21

Conference Committee rejected those words.

22

take the words of art and put them into the bill.

23

took words from the Senate bill, "attributable and

24

assignable," with no technical meanings.

25

But assuming for the moment that the Postal

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. GARVEY, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT IN BOTH CASES

8

MR. GARVEY:

9

Mr. Garvey?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, let me begin by allaying Justice

10

White’s concern about the government's concession in

11

this case.

12

Commission in this case, the Postal Service attributed

13

approximately 13 percent of the services — of the costs

14

of the Postal Service as long-run variable costs, and

15

took the position before the Rate Commission, as it has

16

in each of the prior two general rate proceedings, that

17

long-run variable costs are attributable.

18

As a matter of fact before the Postal Rate

In the Second Circuit, what the government's

19

-- what the Postal Service's brief said in making the

20

point that indirect costs are attributable by cost

21

variation, they quoted the House conferees' report and

22

said Congress did make quite plain that short-term cost

23

variability, quoting from the conferee's report, "was

24

the method prescribed for identifying direct and

25

indirect attributable costs.”
21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

The court of appeals, contrary to the

1
2

suggestion of UPS, did not hold that only short-term

3

variable costs are attributable.

4

in the — at Page 24 of the court of appeals* opinion,

5

it said thisi

perfectly consistent with what the Second Circuit held?

19

MR. GARVEY*

I believe it is.

20

There are two references in the Second

21

Circuit's opinion to short-run variability.

The

22

references are a quotation of the House conferees*

23

report which did in fact use the term "costs which vary

24

over the short term" in response to line — on Page 25.

25

On Page 27, they say, again, that, "As to the level of

2

that term in the Conference Committee report is

3

controlling," speaking of the definition which addressed

4

variability with volume and which addressed attribution

5

of specific fixed costs.

6

I think that it is only the most tortured

7

reading of the court of appeals opinion which can limit

8

it to short-run variable costs.

9

QUESTIONS

What do you have to say, Mr.

10

Garvey, about that general proposition, whether myth or

11

reality, that upper class mails have been carrying the

12

junk mail to people's doors at the expense of the upper

13

class mails?

14

MR. GARVEY;

The Postal Reorganization Act was

15

designed to eliminate or to preclude in the future if it

16

had not happened in the past that sort of discrimination

17

against not only third — not only first class mail, but

18

other classes of mail as well.

19

provision in the statute which is at issue in this case,

20

says that each class of mail shall bear — as a minimum,

21

sets a rate floor which each class must pay, what it

22

calls the long-run -- what the Kaple Commission called

23

the long-run variable costs, what the House bill called

24

demonstrably related costs, what the Senate report

25

called incremental costs, and the reason for requiring

3622(b)(3),- the

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

each class of mail to pay those kinds of costs was that

2

that’s necessary to avoid what is a subsidy in the true

3

economic sense.

4

In the real economic sense, a subsidy exists

5

when Class A would actually be better if Class B did not

6

exist.

7

Commission gave was, if you have a machine that is just

8

used for sorting parcels, and first class mail were

9

required to pick up some of the cost of purchasing that

So, for example, if, the example the Kaple

10

machine, then first class mail would actually be worse

11

off if fourth class mail were served then if it were

12

not .

13

With respect to the kinds of mail that you are

14

concerned about, bulk mail in third class is introduced

15

into the postal system already presorted by zip code.

16

It doesn’t need to be cancelled because it hasn’t got a

17

stamp on it.

18

to the Post Office in that fashion.

19

It is already in sacks, and it is brought

First class mail, the kind that is sent from

20

one household to another, the kind that the Greeting

21

Card Publishers are concerned with in this case, is

22

collected by the Post Office from collection boxes.

23

is then brought to the Post Office facility, where it is

24

cancelled, and then sorted according to zip code, and

25

then it is sent to a destination where it is again

It

sorted according to the last two digits of the zip code.

2

All of those kinds of expenses are eliminated

3

by presortation and the lack of need for cancellation

4

and presacking of third class mail, so that it is really

5

comparing apples and oranges to say that third class

6

mail may cost ten cents and first class mail may cost 20

7

cents.

8

9

For one thing, the statute requires that third
class mail bear all the costs that are attributable to

10

that class.

11

Postal Service to apportion the institutional costs

12

above that minimum in accordance with the statutory

13

factors set out by the Act.

14

For another thing, the Act permits the

Justice O’Connor and Justice Rehnquist have

15

suggested that it looks to them from reading the Act as

16

though the Postal Rate Commission was probably left with

17

considerable discretion in apportioning the costs of the

18

Postal Service which were institutional costs above

19

these long-run variable costs.

20

says in Section 3522(b) is that in setting rates, the

21

Postal Rate Commission is to implement a number of

22

policies which Congress gave to the Commission as

23

specific directives in setting costs of mail.

In fact, what the Act

24

The statute says that the Postal Rate

Commission shall make the rates fair and equitable, that

MR. GARVEYs

What are the proper

I think it is perfectly clear

22

from the report of the Kaple Commission, from the House

23

conferees’ statement, and from the indications in the

24

Senate report that what Congress had in mind attributing

25

by way of costs were, first of all, those costs that are
28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

specific to a particular class of mail.

2

that the Kaple Commission gave, again, was a machine

3

that you only use for sorting parcels, even though the

4

cost of that might be a capital cost.

5

Commission said that it ought to be attributed to fourth

6

class mail because it was used for that sort of mail.

7

QUESTIONS

The example

The Kaple

Then that is an example of

8

something that is neither a short-run nor a long-run

9

variable cost.

10

Is that correct?

ME. GARVEY:

Strictly speaking, I think it

11

would be a variable cost over the long run.

12

of machines, I think, might last about 15 years, and

13

your volume predictions over 15 years might require you

14

to acquire more of those machines, so that in a sense

15

they are, although the Kaple Commission, having a more

16

limited horizon of what long-run variable costs were —

17

they suggested five years, I believe -- said that in

18

that time frame that something like a parcel sorter

19

would be a specific fixed rather than variable cost.

Is that kind of equipment within

QUESTION:

1

Well, I thought your brief took the

2

position that the subsection we are talking about only

3

required as a rate floor the volume variable costs

4

attributable to a class.

5

HR. GARVEY:

I hope not, because we also

6

believe, as the Kaple Commission stated and as the House

7

conferees’ report said, that the kinds of costs which

8

the Postal Service is required to attribute are costs

9

which -- let me quote to you from the House conferees’

10

report.

11

conferees had to say about 3622(b)(3) was this.

12

After the conference was over, what the House

“Provision in the conference substitute with

13

respect to costs attributable to a class of mail or type

14

of mail service establishes a floor for each class of

15

mail equal to costs which consist of those costs, both

16

direct and indirect, that vary over the short term in

17

response to changes in volume of a particular class or,

18

even though fixed rather than variable, are the

19

consequence of providing the specific service involved.”

20
21
22

QUESTION:
short-term.

You think they were wrong in saying

They didn’t mean that?

HR. GARVEY:

I’m not sure that it’s fair to

23

say that they were wrong in speaking of short-term.

24

That provision was drafted for the conference by

25

Assistant Postmaster General Hargrove, by the general
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

counsel for the Post Office Department and by the

2

general counsel for the — by the counsel for the

3

Senate, the Senate which had said that only incremental

4

costs are attributable.
And Assistant Postmaster General Hargrove

5
6

testified in hearings before the Subcommittee, the Rate

7

Subcommittee in the House that the phrase "demonstrably

8

related costs,” the phrase used in the House bill, had

9

precisely the same meaning that was given to

10

attributable costs in the House conferees* report.

In

11

his testimony before the Subcommittee, Assistant

12

Postmaster General Hargrove said that in the revenue and

13

cost analysis about which he was testifying, what the

14

Postal Service was doing was attributing costs over the

15

shorter run, and then went on to say that postal

16

ratemaking, being a continuous process, can take the

17

longer-run variations into account as it goes along.
That suggests that the meaning of short as he

18
19

used it and perhaps as the House conferees used it meant

20

the amount of time between one rate proceeding and the

21

next.

22

QUESTION:

Hr. Garvey, you have answered

23

several questions about short-term costs and

24

volume-variable costs.

25

that those terms are simply words of art which allow of

Is it the government's position

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

only one meaning, either something is a short-term cost

2

or it isn’t, or that the postal authorities have some

3

discretion in administering the Act to define those

4

costs perhaps in a way different than someone else

5

might?
FR. GARVEYt

6

The question in this case is

7

really how far the Postal Service and the Commission are

8

required to go in discovering what kinds of costs are

9

caused by particular classes of mail, and the Postal

10

Service does not take the position that it has to be

11

proven by empirical studies to vary with volume to a

12

specific percentage.

13

But what the Postal Service and the Commission

14

do have in mind is that volume variation, and when I say

15

volume variation, I mean variation with the number of

16

pieces, or with the weight, or with the cubic dimensions

17

of the mail, is the way to identify the causes of common

18

costs.

19

For example, if you have a lot of different

20

classes being sorted at the mail facility, and according

21

to zip cole, and stamped, and that sort of thing, if you

22

have 100 letters to sort according to zip code and to

23

stamp, it is going to take approximately twice as long

24

as it would take to sort and cancel 50 letters.

25

Those kinds of costs amounted to about five
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

billion costs in this general rate proceeding, and the

2

Postal Service attributed 100 percent of those costs to

3

the various classes of mail.

4

contending in this case is that what they call cost of

5

service principles ought to be used to distribute

6

various joint costs among the various classes of mail.

What the Petitioners are

7

For example, when the postman goes around his

8

route with a bag full of mail, if he has 100 letters in

9

his bag, it is not going to take him any longer to go

10

around the route than it would if he had 50 letters in

11

the bag.

12

make more stops, but those costs are attributive.

13

the cost of going around the route itself, though, is

14

one the Postal Service treats as a fixed cost.

Or,

15

cost of collecting mail from collection boxes.

It takes

16

approximately the same amount of time to collect 100 —

17

It may take him more time if he has got to

QUESTION;

Just

the

Well, what if in the example you

18

just gave of the postman going around the letter route

19

and the Post Office saying it shouldn't be attributed --

20

HR. GARVEY:

21

QUESTION*

Yes.
— because it is a fixed cost, as

22

you call it, supposing there was -- someone else comes

23

in and says, well, under my theory of accounting, that

24

is not a fixed cost, and the court were to conclude,

25

well, you could go either way on this thing.

You know,

the protesters have something to say for them, but on

2

the other hand, the Postal Service seems to have

3

something to say, too.

4

that a court ought to defer to the Postal Commission

5

on?
ME. GARVEY:

6

Is that the kind of decision

Absolutely.

That's what this

7

Court has said in Colorado Interstate against FPC, that

8

this kind of ratemaking is not a matter for the slide

9

rule.

It is a question of judgment on which the courts

10

ought to defer to the agencies.

11

the Postal Rate Commission as an expert agency in order

12

to resolve those kinds of questions about what causes or

13

what costs were really caused by a particular class of

14

mail, and what costs ought to be treated as

15

institutional and apportioned among the various classes

16

of mail in order to implement the policies of the Act.

Mr. Garvey, unfortunately, we tend

18

to jump around a little bit in an argument like this.

19

It would be helpful to me if you could tell me what the

20

view of the Postal Service is with respect to. A, the

21

properly included direct and indirect elements of cost,

and secondly, in addition to those, what are the

reasonably assignable costs that they should properly

MR. GARVEY;

I think, it is difficult to -- I

2

can give you examples, and I :an give you the general

3

definition of what they treat as properly attributable.

4

QUESTIONS

I would like examples, if you

5

could, because it seems to me that the Commission does

6

have a duty to obey the statute.

7

MR. GARVEY;

8

QUESTIONS

Yes.

Absolutely.

And so, of course, we have to know

9

what the statute means and know what components the

10

Commission thinks belong in the various categories.

11

MR. GARVEY;

What the Postal Service contends

12

are the costs that are attributable under the first part

13

of Subsection (b)(3), as I mentioned before, are the

14

costs that vary with the volume, number of pieces,

15

weight, cubic dimensions of the mail, or costs that are

16

specific to a particular class of mail, like the parcel

17

sorter in the example that I gave.

18

Examples of the first kinds of costs that vary

19

with the volume of mail are the kinds of processing

20

costs that I mentioned earlier, the costs of sorting

21

letters according to zip code, the costs of cancelling

22

letters, many of the costs of delivering mail.

23

before that the cost of the postman going around his

24

route was itself a fixed cost, but the cost of making

25

individual stops in fact varies with the number of

letters to a degree of 40 percent, 50 percent, and that

2

fraction of what the Postal Service calls access costs,

3

the deviation to go to each house, are attributed to the

4

various classes of mail.

5

In addition, the costs of transportation of

6

mail on purchased transportation are attributed.

the Postal Service sends first class mail --

QUESTION:

When

But am I correct that the cost of

using their own vehicles is not attributed?
MR. GARVEY:

That’s correct, although it's

11

misleading to suppose that the sort of use of the Postal

12

Service's own vehicles is the same as the use of

13

vehicles for purchased transportation.

14

is used for transportation of mail between cities.

15

Postal Service, by contrast, uses vehicles for

16

delivering mail, and in that case the vehicles, the

17

drivers’ time and the vehicle maintenance is treated as

18

variable to the same extent as the postman's time would

19

be when he was delivering letters on his route.

20

The latter kind

The Postal Service also uses vehicles within

21

cities to take mail from the main post office to the

22

branches within the city.

1

Postal Service that not only that is not a direct or an

2

indirect cost attributable to different classes, but

3

also it is a cost which is not reasonably assignable to

4

any one class.
MR. GARVEY;

5

It is the Postal Service’s

6

position that the phrase "reasonably assignable" which

7

appears in 3622(b)(3) does not mean what Petitioner UPS

8

contends.
QUESTION;

9

Well, what does it mean?

MR. GARVEYs

10

That is a reference to the

11

remainder of the provisions in 3622(b).

It is an

12

indication that once the Commission distributes the

13

attributable cost to each class of mail, it can’t stop

14

there, that it ought also to take account of each class

15

of mail in apportioning the various institutional

16

costs.

17

Committee, and it —

It was just — that provision was put in by the

QUESTION;

18

By reasonably assignable, you mean

with respect to all other costs other than direct and

20

indirect.

21

judgmental factors.

22

They should be assigned on the basis of

MR. GARVEY;

That’s right.

You take all the

23

other costs of the Postal System, and then you assign

24

them reasonably.

25

to say that a requirement, that reasonable assignment is

It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense

2

particular characteristics.

QUESTION:

Otherwise, it is a little

Well, you would agree, I assume,

5

that thare ara cost accountants who could assign vehicle

6

costs and also route time costs other than on a strictly

HR. GARVEY:

9

Yes.

That — I don’t mean to say

that that method of apportioning costs is irrational.

10

Maybe even that it is unfair.

QUESTION:

12

It may even be good accounting

What I do -- It is not the

QUESTION:

The D.C.

No, but it may be good accounting

practice for many accountants.
MR. GARVEY:

I am not even sure that it is

good accounting practice, because it tells you very

20

little about what you want to know for purposes of

21

ratemaking.

22

done of tha cost ascertainment system, a system of fully

23

distributed costs which the Postal Servies used from

24

1926 until the Act was passed.

25

Let me give an example.

There was a study

In fact, ons of the purposes of the Act was to
38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

eliminate this system of fully distributed costs which

2

the cost ascertainment system exemplified.

3

that was done for the government of the cost

4

ascertainment system was done by Ernst and Ernst, who

5

are respected accountants, I believe, and their

6

conclusion was that the distribution of costs among the

7

various classes of mail according to what they called

8

unsubstantiated hypotheses of causation is singularly

9

unhelpful for ratemaking purposes.

10

It is something that can be done.

The study

As I said,

11

it is not arbitrary.

12

has very little to do with causation of the costs of

13

mail, which is what Petitioners say is the reason for

14

attributing these costs.

15

QUESTION*

In a way, it is even fair.

But it

Just to clarify, your view is that

16

reasonably assignable means reasonably assignable in

17

accordance with factors 4 through 9 of the statute?

18

NR. GARVEY;

19

QUESTION;

20

MR. GARVEY;

21

QUESTION;

Factors 1,2, and 4 through 9.
Right.
That's correct.
At least you say that it is not

22

unreasonable in assigning those costs to refer to those

23

particular factors.

24
25

MR. GARVEY*

I believe it would not be, and I

don't understand the Second Circuit's opinion to forbid

1

that sort of technique in future rate proceedings.
QUESTION*

2

It may be that there is another way

3

of assigning costs, but it is not unreasonable within

4

the meaning of the statute to use these other factors to

5

assign.
MR. GARVEY*

6

7

are plumping in this case?
QUESTION*

8
9

The factors for which Petitioners

Nell, no, the factors which you say

the Postal Service uses in assigning costs.
MR. GARVEY*

10

Absolutely not.

In fact, I

11

believe that what Congress intended in including those

12

other factors in the Act was to have the Postal Rate

13

Commission implement the policies which underlay those

14

factors in its apportionment of institutional costs.
QUESTION*

15

You don’t even need to win on

16

that.

You don't need to, I don’t suppose, say that the

-- that Congress required reference to these other

18

factors in assigning costs.

20

those factors.

24
25

Even if they didn't require

Absolutely, although —
And — At least that is a fallback

MR. GARVEY:

I am not concerned about falling

back in this case, because I believe that anyone who

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

reads the report of the Senate, the report of the House

2

conferees, and the Kaple Commission report, will find

3

that it is perfectly clear what Congress intended to do,

4

that Congress did not mean to limit — to distribute

5

costs according to the three tiers for which UPS

6

contends in this case, that Congress in fact explicitly

7

rejected the system of fully distributed costs for which

8

Petitioners are contending, that Congress meant to

9

require only as a minimum that incremental or long-run

10

variable costs be attributed to each class of mail.
Petitioners contend in this case that what

11
12

happened —
QUESTION;

13

May I interrupt?

You said only

14

incremental or long-run variable, but one of your

15

examples you gave me was the sorting machine, which is

16

neither.
MR. GARVEYs

17

The reason I keep slipping with

18

respect to that sort of example is that at least in this

19

rate proceeding, and in the ones which have preceded it,

20

as a matter of fact, the kinds of costs which are

21

specific to only one class of mail have been relatively

22

minor.

23

which the Kaple Commission gave is a little bit

24

misleading, because the parcel sorter, although there is

25

such a thing, is also used to sort third class parcels.

In fact, even the example of the parcel sorter

QUESTION*

No, but we are talking about

2

concepts now.

3

said that that is an example of a cost item that the

4

statute requires to be assigned on the basis of cost,

5

and then you keep saying, though, it is only long-run or

6

variable costs and incremental costs, and your example

7

doesn't fit your test.

I don't know the dollars.

MR. GARVEY*

do that, because —

QUESTION*

11

MR. GARVEY;

12

QUESTION:

13

Well, but which is your view?
The government's view -Is the fixed cost reguired to be

MR. GARVEY:

Fixed costs, if they are specific

to a particular class of mail.
QUESTION;

16
17

It is a slip of the tongue when I

allocated in the example you gave?

14
15

But you have

All right, so it is a broader

category than the way you have defined it.

18

MR. GARVEY:

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

19

What the Petitioners contend in this case is

20

that it was really the view of the Senate which required

21

the full allocation of costs, which was incorporated in

22

the Act.

23

Petitioner UPS testified in hearings before the Senate,

24

and they pushed for a system of fully distributed costs

25

like that which governed parcel post before the Act was

What the Senate report says is this.

to that contention.

3

The Senate report had this to say in response

"Express companies in the private sector of

4

the economy have expressed their very keen desire to

5

include language in the bill which would require the

6

recovery of fully allocated costs for parcel post.

no particular classification of mail is required to

On the Committee which signed that report were

15

Senator HcGee, Senator Fong, Senator Randolph, Senator

16

Yarborough, and Senator Bayh.

18

conference with the House.

19

Those five gentlemen who

If what Petitioners contend is correct, they

20

would have us believe that those five conferees who

21

signed that report saying that only incremental costs

22

should be attributed, that full allocation of costs was

23

specifically rejected, changed their position and

24

somehow succeeded in persuading the House as well to

25

change its position, and to require full allocation of
43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

costs, or 75 psrrsnt allocation of costs under

2

Subsection (b)(3) as they contend here, or 80 to 30

3

percent of allocation of costs, as the Greeting Card

4

Publishers contended before the Postal Rate Commission

5

in this proceeding.

6

QUESTION;

7
8

9

What is your view of the proper

percentage that should be allocated?
MR. GARVEY;

It is difficult to say what the

proper percentage is, because it depends on studies

10

which the Postal Service is continually making to

11

identify costs.

12

identified in this case was 59.3 percent of the total

13

revenue requirement.

14

in this case attributed 64 percent of the total cost,

15

and then, according to the principles of service-related

16

cost, assigned another approximately 9 or 10 percent of

17

the costs of the postal system.

18

The percentage which the Postal Service

The Postal Rate Commission itself

So that what was actually done by the

19

Commission was an attribution and assignment of 74

20

percent of the costs.

21

Let me just summarize briefly.

What the

22

Postal Reorganization Act requires is that the Postal

23

Service and the Postal Rate Commission in setting rates

24

for the various classes of mail engage in essentially a

25

two-step process.

The first of those steps is the
44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

requirement that each class of mail bear the direct and

2

indirect costs attributable to that class of mail, which

3

include both specific fixed costs and costs that vary

4

with volume over the long run.

5

After that sort of attribution is done,

6

3622(b)(3) goes on to say that the Postal Service should

7

assign all of the other costs of the Postal Service in

8

some reasonable fashion, and what Congress had in mind

9

in stricturing that sort of assignment of the remaining

10

costs were the policies embodied in 3622(b)(1),

11

and (b)(4)

12

factors which the Commission considers relevant.

through (9), the last of which is any other

13

Thank you.

14

QUESTIONi

May I ask one more question before

15

you sit down?

16

allocation of service-related costs was proper?

Does the service think that the

MR. GARVEYi

17

(b)(2),

The service believes that the

18

allocation of service-related costs is not proper,

19

although the service believes that it is not forbidden

20

by the Act.

The reason the service is concerned about

1

21

the allocation of service-related costs is that for one

22

thing the principles of causation which would be the

23

reason for tracing those kinds of costs are somewhat

24

diminished by the fact that Congress has now sail that

25

even if there aren’t preferential classes of mail, the
45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

service is still required to adhere to the same delivery

2

system, and what is more, even if they were caused by

3

the preferential classes of mail, there is no denying

4

that other classes of mail are delivered six days a week

5

along with the preferential classes, so that they would

6

be getting a free ride if those costs were only charged

7

to first and second class mail.

8
9

On the other hand, the Postal Service
concedes, as the court of appeals held and as the

10

Commission believes in this case, that there are

11

similarities between service-related costs and what in

12

utility ratemaking generally are called peak load costs

13

or there are also similarities between service-related

14

costs and the kinds of specific fixed costs with which

15

you have been concerned, and those similarities suggest

16

that that question about the proper distribution of

17

service-related costs is perhaps one which ought to be

18

left to the expert judgment of the Postal Rate

19

Commission and in a proper case the Postal Service.

that in my judgment, and there is — which I have here

2

— there is a specific statement, we have no power to

3

send this back, with any decision as to any rate, and

4

what they are trying to do is to get the Postal Service

5

to do its job, to exercise its discretion within the

6

rules, and I suggest to this Court that it is not

following the rules, and if Judge Meskel's opinion can
