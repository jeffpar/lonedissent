ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GELLERs

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court, the issue in this case is

10

whether a person who has been convicted of a felony in

11

state court and who therefore is disabled from dealing

12

in firearms under the Gun Contol Act of 1968 is relieved

13

of these federal disabilities when his conviction is

14

subsequently expunged under state law.
QUESTION:

15

Mr. Geller, is the question of

16

whether or not this particular respondent was convicted

17

before us?

18

MR. GELLER:

Well, the Fourth Circuit held

19

that he was convicted, and therefore we have not raised

20

that question.

respondents raised it.

Since we had won on that issue

10

in the Fourth Circuit, wa did not consider presenting it

11

here, and never inquired into whether it was briefed in

12

the Fourth Circuit.

13

without too much difficulty that Kennison, the fellow at

14

issue here, had been convicted when he pleaded guilty in

15

Iowa state court, as I hope to get to in a minute, as I

16

briefly explain the statement of facts here.

The Fourth Circuit seemed to assume

David Kennison is the chairman of the board of

18

directors and a substantial stockholder of the

19

respondent, New Banner Institute.

20

arrested and charged with kidnapping in Iowa, and

21

pursuant to a plea bargain, the kidnapping charge was

22

dismissed, but he pleaded guilty to the charge of

23

carrying a concealed weapon, which is a felony

24

punishable by five years' imprisonment in Iowa.

25

In 1974, he was

2

Kennison to probation.

3

leave Iowa and go home to South Carolina, where he

4

served his period of probation.

Kennison was then allowed to

At the end of the probationary period, which

5

6

appears to have been one year, Kennison called up the

7

Iowa authorities, announced that he had successfully

8

completed the term of probation, and he had not been

9

arrested during that period.

And then the Iowa court,

10

under the Iowa expunction statute, automatically

11

dismissed the — released Kennison and did not enter

judgment, ordered his criminal record expunged.

convicted of a felony, and these three licenses were

19

issued.

New Banner did not list on the application

Shortly thereafter, the Bureau of Alcohol,

21

Tobacco, and Firearms learned of Kennison's Iowa

22

conviction, and served notice of its intent to revoke

23

the licenses.

24

Law Judge, the director of the Bureau of Alcohol,

25

Tobacco, and Firearms found that Kennison had been

and that Kennison had the power to direct the management

and policies of New Banner Institute.

Therefore, the Director ordered New Banner's

licenses revoked.

order, but the Fourth Circuit reversed.

9

The — New Banner sought judicial

The court of appeals agreed, as I said a
moment ago, that Kennison had been convicted when he

10

pleaded guilty in Iowa court to the felony, and

11

therefore the federal firearms disabilities had been

12

triggered at that point, but the Fourth Circuit believed

13

that since that offense had been expunged under state

14

law, it could no longer serve as a predicate for the

15

imposition of penalties or disabilities under the Gun

16

Control Act.

17

Therefore, the Fourth Circuit ordered the

18

director to issue the licenses, these three licenses, to

19

New Banner Institute under the federal statute.

20

Now, the Bureau revoked New Banner's licenses

21

in this case under the provisions of Section

22

923(d)(1)(B) of the statute, which prohibits the

23

issuance of a license to anyone who is disabled from

24

transporting, shipping, or receiving firearms or

25

ammunition under Sections 922(g) or (h) of the Act.

Right.
But the question is, how did

Congress intend that the meaning of the word be sought?
MR. GELLER:

Agreed, and what we think, the

19

only thing that makes sense in line with the purposes

20

that Congress intended to accomplish in the Gun Control

21

Act was that a conviction means there has been a formal

22

adjudication of guilt of a serious crime.

23

Congress meant to have that question depend on the

24

nuances or the niceties or the peculiarities of state

25

law, whether they call something a conviction or not.

MR. GELLER:

Precisely.

Precisely, precisely, Mr. Chief

Justice.
QUESTION:

But the felony definition certainly

could embrace such deviations, and —
MR. GELLER:

Well, it could. Justice

Rehnquist, but we don't think it's likely to.

We think

10

that there is some common understanding of what are

11

serious crimes, and virtually every state deals with

12

those crimes by labeling them felonies.

QUESTION:

In Arizona, it is a felony to steal

16

MR. GELLER;

Now, I dare say that

But there are failsafe mechanisms

17

in the statute to deal with that situation, and I hope

18

to get to them eventually.

19

as that, Congress allowed the Secretary of the Treasury

20

to grant relief from the federal statute.

21

If you have a situation such

But what we think Congress meant to do was to

22

set a federal standard for what is a conviction for

23

purposes of imposing these federal, these important

24

federal disabilities.

25

there been an adjudication of guilt of a serious crime?

What that standard is is, has

1

Have all the facts been found?

Is all that remains to

do imposing some level of punishment?
How, what level of punishment the state

decides to impose for its own purposes is really

5

irrelevant to the disabilities that Congress wanted to

impose in this situation?

7

decide to sentence the person to five years’

9

relevant only to state law enforcement purposes, not

The fact that one state may

federal law enforcement purposes.
The purpose of relying on the existence or, as

11
12

this Court said in Lewis, the fact of a conviction, is

13

that people who are convicted, who are found guilty of a

14

serious crime. Congress believed to be a member of a

15

class of presumptively risky people, people who should

18

not be allowed to deal in firearms, unless they get a

17

special dispensation from the Secretary of the Treasury.
Now, we think that that presumption of

18
19

riskiness attaches when there has been a formal

20

adjudication that the defendant committed a crime, and

21

not -- it doesn't depend on what happens thereafter -2UESTI0N;

MR. GELLERs

7

You would have to find the point

8

where the judge has actually found the defendant

committed the elements of a crime, and that all he is

10

going to do thereafter is to determine the appropriate

11

punishment.

12

example, one in -- and in both states the defendant

13

commits the exact same crime, violating the exact same

14

statutory provisions, and in State One, the defendant,

as you say, enters a guilty plea.

MR. GELLER:

It depends upon what the

At that point, we think there has been a

How, as I was saying, you could have a

situation where the judge accepts the guilty plea and

9

defers the entry of the judgment and says, I am going to

10

just watch your behavior over the next year before I

11

sentence you.

12

I think probably happened here in Iowa, in which the

13

judge accepts the guilty plea, enters a sentence — here

14

it was a probationary sentence — and at the and of the

15

year, based on the defendant's conduct, expunges the

16

sentence.

17

You can have a second case, which is what

It seems to me the only differences between

18

those two situations is that in Case Number Two, the

19

judge has entered a formal document labeled Judgment,

20

but in either case there has been a factual finding that

21

the defendant committed a serious crime.

22

defendants would seem to fall into the presumptively

A pardon?
The same thing.
It is interesting that you

mention a pardon, because Congress dealt with a pardon.

24

QUESTION;

25

MR. GELLER;

Yes, that's what I mean.
Congress dealt with a pardon in

18
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 623-9300

1

Title VII, and it said that a pardon, if it

2

specificalliy announces that the defendant is still —

3

is to be allowed to engage in carrying of firearms,

4

serves to relieve disabilities, but Congress did not say

5

that in Title IV, which is the statute at issue here.

6

So presumably Congress did not want to allow

7

gubernatorial parties to relieve defendants of the

8

disabilities imposed by federal law, yet the Fourth

9

Circuit has held that state expungements, which may be

10

less of an indication that the defendant is a

11

responsible person than a gubernatorial pardon, relieve

12

the defendant of those — of those important federal

13

disabilities.
Sow, I had hoped to get into a discussion of

14
15

some of the statutory provisions in order to show the

16

Court that the Fourth Circuit's decision is clearly

17

inconsistent with Congress's intent, and I am not going

18

to have time to discuss several of them, but I do want

19

to discuss what we believe perhaps is the most important

20

indication that the Fourth Circuit has incorrectly

21

construed the statute, and that is Section 925(c) of the

22

Act, which I alluded to earlier.
Congress realized that not everyone who was

23
24

convicted of a felony under state law is a risky

25

person.

They also realized that it would be — people,

even if they were initially risky, might rehabilitate

2

themselves, and it would be unduly harsh to subject

3

those people to lifetime or permanent disabilities.
But it is instructive to see what Congress did

in that situation.

22

1

likely to act in a manner dangerous to the public

2

safety, ani that the granting of relief, i.e., allowing

3

him to deal with firearms, would not be contrary to the

4

public interest.
Congress wrote that right into the statute,

5

6

and the Secretary must make this precise finding after

7

an individualized inquiry every time he grants relief

8

from the disabilities of the Act, and under Section

9

925(c), whenever the Secretary grants relief, he has to

10

promptly publish notice of that fact in the Federal

11

Register.
QUESTION*

12

Is it correct to think that under

13

925(c) the Secretary may not grant relief if the crime

14

in question is one -- is one involving the use of a

15

firearm or other weapon?
HR. GELLERi

16

That's correct.

The Secretary is

17

disabled from granting relief in that situation, but

18

look at the anomalies that would arise if the Fourth

19

Circuit were correct, because state officials would,

20

even though Congress carefully circumscribed the power

21

of the Secretary to grant relief from the firearms

22

disabilities imposed by the Act, state officials would

23

have unfettered discretion to accomplish even more than

24

Congress authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to

25

do.

MR. GELLER:

— of vacating the judgment.
Yes.

It is extremely relevant.

7

I mean, the purpose in fixing disabilities on people who

8

are convicted is that the fact of conviction, as the

9

Court said repeatedly in Lewis, is a reliable indicator

10

of whether that person is presumptively irresponsible or

11

too risky.
QUESTION;

12

Yes, but it is equally reliable if

you reverse on the ground that the evidence was

improperly obtained with a search warrant, or something

like that.

16

MR. GELLER;

Well, there may also be

17

constitutional problems in imposing disabilities on

18

someone who has had his conviction reversed, but we

19

don’t have to reach that.

20

of Congressional intent, the fact of conviction is no

21

longer a reliable indicator of riskiness if in fact the

22

defendant has had his conviction reversed because of

23

some legal error or because of innocence.

The question is, would Congress have wanted

6

the states to forgive federal disabilities.

We think

7

the answer to that on its face is probably wrong, but it

8

is certainly wrong when Congress has put in a specific

9

forgiveness provision in the federal statute, Section

10

925(c), which requires a cabinet level federal official

11

to make an individualized inquiry before granting relief

12

from the Gun Control Act, to see whether the defendant

13

is in fact a responsible, reliable person who should be

14

trusted with a firearm.

15

QUESTION;

In other words, a conviction for

16

manslaughter by use of an automobile might be the kind

17

that the Secretary would have discretion to waive.

18

MR. GELLER;

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

In

19

fact, the Secretary granted relief in 800 cases last

20

year in which he was satisfied that the person in

21

question was not risky or could be trusted to carry or

22

deal in firearms, but as I said, every time he did that,

23

he had to publish a notice of that fact in the Federal

24

Register, so that people would be aware of what the

25

legal status of this individual is.

standards.

QUESTIONi

Do you think the Secretary of the

10

Treasury spends a lot of his waking hours passing on

11

these applications?

12

MR. GELLERi

I would be surprised if he spends

13

very much time, but there are people in the Bureau of

14

Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms who do spend a great deal

15

of time studying these applications and making

16

individualized inquiries.

17

QUESTION:

And if they got too casual about

18

the exercise of that discretion, they would probably

19

20

MR. GELLERi

I think that's right.

This is an

21

important federal statute.

The Court has remarked on

22

that many times, and I needn't remind the Court of the

23

history that gave rise to Title IV and Title VII of the

24

Omnibus Crime Control Act.

25

about allowing people who were convicted of felonies to

It imposed a disability on these

2

people, and it allowed the Secretary of the Treasury, a

3

cabinet level federal official, to remove that

4

disability.
It didn't, we think., mean to allow state

5

8

officials using unfettered discretion across the country

7

and not making any inquiry into whether the person could

8

be trusted to carry a firearm to relieve the

9

disabilities of the Gun Control Act.
Now, I just want to make one more point before

10

11

I reserve time for rebuttal, and that is that if the

12

Court agrees with the Fourth Circuit, if it says that

13

effect must be given to state expungements, then it is

14

going to have to confront the much more difficult

15

question of exactly what effect is to be given to these

Now, when a state convicts someone of a crime,

21

it imposes on that defendant a bundle of disabilities.

22

It would be quite bizzare if by expunging only a portion

of those disabilities, federal courts were willing to

24

remove the disabilities imposed by Congress under the

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

Therefore# it would seem that there would have

2

to be an individualized inquiry by the federal courts in

3

every single case to see whether what remains after the

4

expungement is still considered a conviction for federal

gun control purposes.
Now, this would be, we think, chaotic.

would lead to massive confusion in enforcement of the

No one would know what their legal status is if
The Fourth Circuit

10

here masked those difficulties by calling the Iowa

expungement statute absolute and unconditional, where we

12

think that is plainly incorrect for reasons we have

13

discussed in our reply brief, but even if it were true

14

in the case of the Iowa statute, there were dozens and

15

dozens of other expunction statutes out there, and if we

16

had to give effect to those expunction statutes under

17

federal law, the situation would be chaotic.

18

The Secretary of the Treasury would not know

19

whether he could grant a license to someone who had an

20

expunged conviction.

21

whether they would be committing a crime by selling a

22

firearm to someone with an expunged conviction.

In this case, there appears to be an

status.

12

of the granting or the -- the granting of the

the disabilities imposed or to restore civil rights in

states that under the deferred judgment statute, upon

discharge from probation, if the judgment has been

14

deferred under 789-A.1, the court's criminal record with

15

reference to the deferred judgment shall be expunged,

16

18

19

successful completion of the probationary period
