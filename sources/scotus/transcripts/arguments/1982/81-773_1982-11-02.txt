MR. WEFALD;

We u/ill hear arguments

next in North Dakota against the United States.

£ E I N 5 5

Mr. Chief Justice*

and may it

please the Court, this appeal involves a statutory

10

construction of the word "consent" in the gubernatorial

11

consent provision of the Wetlands Loan Act of 1961 and

12

the constitutionality of certain North Dakota statutes

13

believed by the United States to unconstitutionally

14

interfere with the acquisition of wetland easements for

15

waterfowl production areas in North Dakota's prairie

16

pothole region covering central and northwest North

17

Dakota.
Three issues developed at the proceedings

18
19

below.

Briefly, these are as follows.

First,

the

20

United States sought a declaratory judgment action that

21

these several North Dakota laws are unconstitutional.

22

Second, the district court held that these laws are

23

unconstitutional, and that no consent is required.

24

Third, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth

25

Circuit held not only are these laws unconstitutional

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and that no consent is required» but that consent is

2

present here and cannot be revoked.

3

As you will see» the dispute between the

4

United States and North Dakota has been narrowed through

5

several concessions made by the United States in its

6

brief.

7

required, but that consent can be revoked after a

8

reasonable period of time, and that some of the

9

challenged laws are constitutional, and that others are

The United States has conceded that consent is

10

constitutional only insofar as they cover future

11

acquisitions of wetlands in excess of those wetlands not

12

yet acquired under consents the United States claims to

13

hold.

14

Let me first deal with the question of

15

consent, including whethar it is required, whether it

16

has been revoked, and whether it has been exhausted.

17

than want to deal with the constitutionality of the

18

North Dakota laws in question.

19

I

Our argument today is staged against the

20

backdrop of our position that the acquisition of these

21

wetlands involves two separate and disinct steps.

22

First, consent must be obtained from our governor.

23

Second, easements must be governed by the real property

24

law of the state of North Dakota.

25

Let me point out that we are talking here

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

about easements» not fee land.

2

point out that consent seems to be the main issue as

3

opposed to the unconstitutionality of our laws, because

4

the United States has essentially taken the position

5

that our laws basically constitute a condition of prior

6

gubernatorial consent* and to that extent it cannot fall

7

through on the revocation that we cannot do it.

8

other words, the governor says — the United States

9

says, you cannot revoke, you cannot condition your

10
11

Secondly* I msnt to

In

laws.
Let's first of all talk about the consent and

12

the first concession on Pages 12 and 16, particularly

13

Footnote 11 of the United States' brief on Pace 16.

14

think that concession, our brief adequately sets forth

15

the laws we are talking about and the particular error

16

made by both the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and the

17

District Court, where they held that the gubernatorial

18

consent provision simply doesn't apply, and I think that

19

is adequately taken care of, and I will not be

20

addressing that particular point.

21

I

Let's talk now about the consent and the

22

revocation of the consent.

23

talking about here is prospective only.

24

does not assert that the consent of our governor to the

25

acquisition of these wetland easements is retroactive.

This bill» the Wetlands Loan Act of 1961 —

3

QUESTION;

4

MR. WEFALD;

5

QUESTION;

Mr. Attorney General —
Yes, sir.
— prospective in what sense?

As I

6

— Maybe I am confused, but it seemed to me there ujere

7

700,000 acres in uihich easements had been formally

8

acquired.

9
10

MR. WEFALD;
QUESTION;

765,000, Your Honor.
And approximately the same amount

11

in which they were described as unused or

12

unconsummatec.

13

apply to the latter group?

14

Would your prospective argument not

MR. WEFALD;

What we are suggesting is that

15

there is — that the governor of our state has the right

16

to say, I hereby no longer consent to the acquisition of

17

any easements.

18

that somehow in the early sixties, 1961 through "64, and

19

again in the early seventies with Governor Link, that

20

certain consents were signed, and that those consents

21

are irrevocable.

22

What the United States is suggesting is

Now, an example of that consent is found on

23

the Joint Appendix, Page 3.

A couple of things to

24

notice about that consent form, first of all.

25

prepared by the Fish and Wildlife Service.

That was

That

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

document is on official Wildlife Service letterhead.

2

The United States says, well, it says unequivocally in

3

there that the governor consents, and it doesn't say

4

that he says, I am reserving the right to revoke.
Query:

5

If the United States, the Fish and

6

Wildlife Service, as the drafter of that instrument had

7

wanted to be clear that the governor could not revoke,

8

couldn't they have out into their instrument, this

9

should be irrevocable?

And query:

Do you think our

10

governor would have signed it under that circumstance?

11

I doubt it.

QUESTION:

12
13

Well, Governor Guy was an able

person.
MR. WEFALD:

14
15

And that's the issue here.

He certainly was, a good

governor.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. WEFALD:

So?
So he signed a document prepared

18

by the Fish and Wildlife Service that said, we are now

19

going to be consenting to the acquisition of easements

20

in North Dakota.

21

is in the Joint Appendix that says, I am — I never

22

intended to relinquish my right to approve from time to

23

time .

He has also signed an affidavit which

QUESTION:

25

MR. WEFALD:

General Wefald —
Yes, sir.

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION

1

I found the record» or the

2

opinions, at least, a little skimpy as to exactly what

3

9ach of these two stages consist of.

4

gather, is getting consent from the governor.

5

MR. WEFALD:

6

QUESTION:

7

The first, I

That's correct.
Which is given on a county by

county basis?

8

MR. WEFALD:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.
And does the government, the

10

federal government, or the Fish and Wildlife Service

11

simply come in with the sort of consent form that

12

appears on Page 3 of the Joint Appendix?

13

in with that along with a map showing, you know, how

14

much in Kidder County is being taken, or does the

15

governor simply sign these without having any map before

16

him?

17

MR. WEFALD:

Ooes it come

You raise an excellent question,

18

Justice Rehnquist.

When these signings took place, we

19

don't know exactly what the governor had before him.

20

know that there was no specific indication as to 'what

21

particular potholes, what particular wetlands were going

22

to be acquired.

23

QUESTION:

24

problem, I suppose.

25

the consent, he could have said, show me some maps.

We

Well, that was the governor's
I mean, if he hadn't wanted to sign

Wall» I think if the governor's

problem at all was that ha baliaved that the United

3

States would treat him fairly in this regard, and that

4

he put his faith in the fact that this acquisition mas

going to take place over a period of time.

sort of an interesting observation.

MR. WEFALD;

QUESTION:

Certainly we could have.
You don't say we should appoint a

22

guardian for the state of North Dakota.

23

(General laughter.)

24

MR. WEFALDl

25

We didn't

Absolutely not.

And we do say

that we ought to be able to rely on the federal

QUESTION:

What mould the United States —

What mas the purpose of the

governor ever signing these authorizations if it uias a

of certain acreages in each county» certain acreages —

7

MR. WEFALO:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

He authorized the acauisition

Not specific acreages.
— and your claim is that — Well*

do you mean not spe-cific parcels — up to any amount he
agreed to.

11

MR. WEFALD:

12

QUESTION:

That's it.
And nom you are saying it has to be

13

a parcel to parcel thing.

14

reason for ever getting the authorization then.

15

MR. WEFALO:

16

QUESTION:

Well* there mas no possible

Well, first of all —
He should have just said, mait a

17

minute, George, mhen you get ready to acquire a parcel,

18

just come back and ask me.

19

MR. WEFALD:

20

QUESTION:

21

22

Sure.
3ut he didn't.

He says, go ahead

and acquire 50,000 acres.
MR. WEFALD:

Ah ha.

He didn't go to the Fish

23

and Wildlife Service and say, I mant to give you a

24

consent for 41,000 acres.

25

QUESTION:

No, no.

10

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. WEFALQ:

2

They came to him and said» we

mant you to sign off on 41,000 acres of land.

3

QUESTION:

4

give them anything.
MR. WEFALDi

5

And neither did they ask him to
They just wanted —
And that' the — The reason the

6

United States came to our governor is because the

7

Congress said that it wanted to continue the partnership

8

established in 1959.

9

United States which is that if Congress had not

I agree with the position of the

10

authorized us to consent by law or our governor to

11

consent, that W9 would have no right to interfere or to

12

be involved in the acquisition process whatsoever, but

13

this federal-state partnership was created by the

14

Congress.
QUESTION:

15

General, you talk about the

16

governor's giving the government, giving the federal

17

government, as if the government were kind of conveying

18

state lands, but I take it after the governor consents,

19

that just opens up the acquisition, or if the law

20

provides for a condemnation process.

21

still has to go to individual owners in the state of

22

North Dakota and then pay, doesn't it?
MR. WEFALD:

correct.

The government

Absolutely correct.

Absolutely

And that is what they did over a period of

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION

1

And what you are saying is that

2

what the government has already acquired from individual

3

owners under these consents should be inviolate* but as

4

to land for which consent is still outstanding* but

5

where the interest in the land hasn't been acquired from

6

the individual owner* as to that, the consent should be

7

revocable.

8

MR. WEFALD;

9

QUESTION;

That's correct.
Well, why shouldn't the past

10

acquisitions where individual parcels hadn't been

11

submitted to the governor, why wouldn't they be

12

vulnerable?
MR. WEFALD:

13

Your Honor,

it is not a question

14

of whether or not the governor had consented to specific

15

parcels.

16

is still ongoing in its acquisition process, which it

17

was until they abruptly stopped on July 1 of

18

have under those consents,

19

ahead,

20

We say you don't, because that consent is revocable and

21

our governor --

It#s a question of whether the United States

'77.

They

if they were to proceed

they claim the right to acquire more easements.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. WEFALD:

And it has been revoked,

you say?

Well, all we can tell you today

24

affirmatively is that they hold no consent frcm Governor

25

Olsen to go about this business,

and until they hold a

12

consent from Governor Olsen» they are not authorized by

2

this waterfowl — Wetlands Loan Act of 1961 tc come into

3

our state and acquire easements with the fund* with the

4

Stamp Act fund.
QUESTION:

5

6

Well* they do have the unused

consent forms from previous governors* right?
MR. WEFALD:

7

They have — they claim that they

8

have acreages yet to acquire.

9

about 700*000 or 600*000 yet to acquire* yet they only

10

They claim that they have

want to acquire 20*000.
QUESTION:

11

All right* and you are taking the

12

position now that maybe those have been completely used*

13

and furthermore* you are taking the position that maybe

14

the original consent was not sufficiently specific*

15

right?

16

MR. WEFALD:

17

QUESTION:

18

Did you make those arguments

below?

MR. WEFALD:

QUESTION:

21

As to the specificity --

The argument —
Dr are we hearing those for the

first time here?
MR. WEFALD:

I think it is fair to believe

10

that Congress in its refusal to repeal the gubernatoria1

that we have an active voice in this partnership, and in

13

fact we would be able to consent.
It is not that the — the government doesn't

6

QUESTION:

Does the legislation in your view

7

require the consent of the governor or the state agency

only for acquisition out of the fund?

9

MR. WEFALO:

Yes, and that is what the law

10

specifically provides.

11

the money into it, and has continually put money into

12

that fund for the purpose of making these particular

13

acquisitions, but the United States in this particular

14

case has acquired 4.8 million acres, and there are

15

several cases below that in fact pose — that in fact

16

bring all the total legal subdivision into the National

17

Wildlife Refuge System and not just the waterfowl

18

production areas, and in fact in the untried case of

19

Towner v. Key, on Footnote 14 of Page 19 in the United

20

13

upheld as to constitutionality.

14

statements* surely it is clear that there is a right and

2

a good reason for public participation and a need for

3

doing so* whether it is at the federal level or the

4

state level* and we simply imposed a reasonable and a

5

rational requirement in fulfillment of our sovereignty.

6

The 18.2 law advises the landowners of their

right to negotiate.

There is nothing uirong with that.

8

There can't be anything unconstitutional about that.

9

And indeed, the United States concedes that that is

constitutional* notwithstanding the pronouncements of

12

constitutionality is dubious insofar as that section

talks about after expanded wetlands and the right of the

to the original wetland parameters.

government has not made a valid acquisition.

u/ere trying to make alternative arguments.

North Dakota

6

has come to rely more and more on its argument that even

if its governor's consent cannot be revoked, the United

8

States already has acquired more acreage than the

9

governors already — ever approved, but the state did

10

not present this issue in its jurisdictional statement,

11

and it therefore cannot rely on it before this Court,

12

nor is that issue fairly comprised within the issues

13

that tuere presented.

14

And in any event, the contention is specious.

15

It is because of the peculiar nature of ujaterfotul

16

production area country, that is, lands that have been

17

— that are characterized by numerous small, scattered,

18

and irregularly shaped inetland.

19

adopted the practice of acquiring easements covering all

20

of the ujetlands occuring on a given described legal

21

subdivision, but tuhile the easement instrument describes

22

a legal subdivision, the easement restrictions luhich are

23

only on draining, filling, leveling, and burning,

24

expressly apply only to the ujetlands occuring on that

The statutory language, of course, contains no

Why do you say that?

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

5

QUESTION:

Why shouldn't the full intent of

6

Congress be given expression to?
MS. ETKIND:

7

Well, we believe the full intent

8

of Congress should be, but we believe that the full

9

intent of Congress was that the states had a right to

10

withhold their consent at the outset if that's what they

11

chose to do, or to condition it prospectively, but not

12

to revoke it once it had been given.
QUESTION:

13
14

Well, I was curious about where you

derived the principle of narrow construction.
MS. 5TKIN0:

15

From the fact that in the normal

16

case, we would be able to just go into a state and buy

17

the land.
QUESTION:

18
19

Well, but Congress has said this

isn't going to be the normal case.
MS. ETKIND:

20

That's right, but this is a

21

proviso, a limiting proviso at the end of a general

22

enabling provision, and the statutory rule of

construction is that such provisions are narrowly

24

construed .

4

intended that the legitimate concerns of the states

wouldn't be ignored, and therefore it required the

United States to obtain prior gubernatorial consent, but

the main thrust of the legislative history is Congress's

concern with the urgency of the need for the federal

acquisition of wetlands.

10

Like the statute itself, the

To be sure, Congress

As I mentioned in response to Justice

11

O'Connor's question, the Congress knew that it would be

12

impossible for the federal government to bring about a

13

program of this magnitude without meticulous long-range

14

planning, and it would have been wholly inconsistent

15

with that recognition for Congress to have intended the

16

governors would be free to revoke their consents once

17

validly given, at least until the United States had had

18

a reasonable time to act on them.

19

The Secretary must be able to rely on the

20

continued effectiveness of gubernatorial consent, at

least for a reasonable time, in order to obtain the

22

there's no question in this case that there has been a

purported revocation by the Governor, as well as by the

legislature.

That is equally invalid.
Is that geared to this particular

Isn't it a general state law that

that rule that may not apply to some of these other

23

MS. ETKIND:

Well, I think there's two

24

problems with it.

One is that if you agree with us that

25

the consents we already have are valid, then that would

54

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

be a partial revocation of that consent because the

consents me have alloui us to —
QUESTION:

3

Well, but they mould argue,

I

4

suppose, that what you've got a consent to is to acquire

5

in accordance with the otherwise valid laws of the state

6

of North Dakota that do not specifically burden wildlife

7

land any differently than it burdens anything else.
MS. HTKINO;

8

9
10

Well, we would say that those

statutes that were in effect at the time the consent was
given, but not after-enacted statutes.
QUESTION:

11

Well,

supposing they passed a new

12

recording statute that said every transfer of real

13

property has to be recorded with the secretary of state

14

instead of the county recorder of deeds or something

15

like that.

16

Would you have to comply with that?
MS. ETKINO:

Well, I think that would be on a

17

different footing, because this particular statute has a

18

particularly adverse impact on the acquisition program.

19

In a related context, when Congress amended the

20

Migratory Bird Conservation Act in 1976 to permit the

21

Secretary to purchase easements as well as fees for

22

wildlife refuge purchases,

23

make every effort to obtain permanent easements rather

24

than lesser interests, because such an approach was in

the best interest of the habitat and the migratory water

that insofar as they purport to condition the

to that, has he in effect revoked or not?
