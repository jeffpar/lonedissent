ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM SIMON, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF BANKAMERICA CORPORATION, INC., ET. AL.,
PETITIONERS

MR. SIMON:

7

9

I think you may proceed

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
The issue here is whether Section 8 of the

10

1914 Clayton Act, which bars corporate director

11

interlocks between two or more corporations other than

12

banks, applies to one bank and one non-bank; namely, one

13

bank and an insurance company.

14

The appellants here are four insurance

15

companies, three banks, three bank holding companies,

16

and three individuals who were directors at the same

17

time of both a bank and an insurance company.

18

Both the District and the Circuit Courts found

19

that 40 percent of all insurance directors in America

20

were also directors of banks, and that this situation

21

had prevailed for a long time, and yet until the filing

22

of this case, 61 years after the enactment of the

23

statute, the government had never attacked the

24

bank-insurance interlock.

25

Indeed, the amicus brief of the American

2

their insurance company members have one or more bank

directors on their board.

stipulated record.

13

has held the act inapplicable to this interlock, each

holding that the statutory language was clear and

one District Judge has held that the act is applicable

Court.

after the oral argument.

face of the statute* secondly, if Your Honors get that

far, the clear legislative history; and finally, 60

years of uninterpreted administrative construction of

2

the statute by the Department of Justice, the Federal

3

Trade Commission, and the Congress.
QUESTIONS

5

Do you mean uninterpreted or

uninterrupted ?

6

HR. SIMON;

Both, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

7

The language of the statute, I submit, is

8

clear, and it appears in several places in the brief,

9

but one page is page 2 of our brief, which is the blue

10

brief.

And the statute provides as follows:

No person

11

at the same time shall be a director, one, in any two or

12

more corporations; two, any one of which has capital in

13

surplus of a million dollars -- and I point out where

14

the Congress meant any one of them; it said any one of

15

them has capital of a million dollars; three, engaged in

16

whole or in part in commerce, which I submit means two

17

or more corporations engaged in whole or in part in

18

commerce; and four, other than banks, banking

19

associations, trust companies, and common carriers

20

subject to the Interstate Commerce Commission Act.
In his opinion in the District Court Judge

21

22

Peckham said of that language, and I quote from his

23

opinion, "An examination of this language reveals four

24

criteria which must be met before this statute may be

25

applied;

First, a person must simultaneously serve as a

5

1

director of two or more competing corporations; second/

2

at least one of the corporations must have capital

3

surplus and undivided profits of greater than a million

4

dollars; third, both or all of the corporations must be

5

engaged in interstate commerce; and fourth, the

6

corporations must be other than banks, banking

7

associations, trust companies, or common carriers.

8

We submit that two corporations other than
banks and common carriers excludes two corporations, one

10

of which is a bank or a common carrier.

11

different provisions relating to three different classes

12

of corporations in this statute as showing that Congress

13

did not have in mind a uniform legislative purpose.

14

There are three

The second and third unnumbered paragraphs of

15

the House bill relate to banks.

And as presently

16

amended, they apply only where one of the banks is a

17

member of the Federal Reserve System and no more than a

18

third of the banks in the country are members of the

19

Federal Reserve System.

It provides only that when

there is an interlocking directorate between a borrower

And then the fourth unnumbered paragraph of

the legislative history was referred to as the

This case does not involve an exemption from

12

the antitrust laws with the accompanying narrow rules of

13

construction.

15

antitrust laws, or the Capra-Volstead Act,which exempted

16

farm co-ops from antitrust laws, or the Securities Act,

which exempted the Stock Exchange from the antitrust

18

laws.

19

which is not met in the case before this Court.

20

This is not a case like the

This case involves a requirement of the statute

Now, I think that that is the end of the

21

lawsuit, but I do think if the Court goes beyond the

22

face of the statute, the legislative history is

23

compelling, and I would like to speak to it briefly.

24

Nister -- later Justice — Brandeis was an

25

adviser to President Wilson in

1914, and ha testified

1

before the House Judiciary Committee on this

2

legislation, having previously written a long series of

3

articles on the subject matter which were published in

4

Harpers.
The Pujo Committee of the Senate had conducted

5
6

hearings on this subject, and its General Counsel,

7

Samuel Untermyer testified before the House Judiciary

8

Committee on this bill.

9

Untermyer urged upon the House Judiciary Committee that

Both Hr. Brandeis and Hr.

10

the bill should cover insurance-bank interlocks.

11

they said it doesn't do it and you should amend the bill

12

to make it cover it.

13

admonition.

The House took no heed of their

20

common carriers but, as I noted, only borrowers and

21

suppliers.

22

It did not have the banks in

And at that time, the first paragraph related to

In the Senate the Senate struck all banking

23

provisions from the bill so that as it passed the Senate

24

the banking provisions of the House bill were

25

eliminated.

When it got to conference, the House

1

conferees insisted on putting back the House provisions

2

on the banking provisions, and the Senate conferees

3

ultimately said, okay, we’ll put the House — we’ll put

4

those things back, but we want to put in between "other

5

than common carriers" the words "banks, banking

6

associations, and trust companies.

7

Conference Committee Report was changed to read "other

8

than banks and common carriers."

And so the

I think most conclusive on the legislative

9
10

history is the fact that when the Conference Committee

11

Report got back to the House, Congressman Kann made a

12

point of order that the conferees had exceeded their

13

jurisdiction in inserting the words "banks" between

14

"other than" and "common carriers."

15

the position that the Department of Justice takes before

16

you today, and he said that the conferees had gone

17

beyond their authority.

He opposed, he took

Congressman Shirley and Congressman Webb, who

18
19

were both members of the Conference Committee, agreed

20

with him that the bill did just what he said it did, but

21

they argued that it did not go beyond the authority of

22

the Conference Committee because they merely put into

23

the statute in explicit terms what was previously

24

implicit.

25

overruled the point of order, and the bill passed in

that manner
Because we think the debate on this point of

3

order is so important to the legislative history, we

4

have copied it in its totality in an appendix to our

5

reply brief.

6

Congressman Mann, from A-2 of the yellow brief.

7

before the quotation in the middle of the sentence, he

8

says, what the conferees have done is to eliminate from

9

this section all banking corporations.

10

And I would like to read two sentences of
Just

And then skipping to the last five lines of

11

the page, he says, and the conferees by their report

12

undertake to eliminate from this prohibition of

13

interlocking directorates not only the railroads subject

14

to the act to regulate commerce but also banks, banking

15

institutions, and trust companies.

16

with that he — with what he said.

17

And we indeed agree

How, on page 14 Congressman Shirley, who

18

supported the Conference Report, said in a sentence

19

beginning about two inches down from the top of the

20

page, the conferees having redrafted the matter have

21

gotten away from the language of Section 9 of the House

22

and Section 7 of the Senate — and what is now Section 8

23

was 9 in the House and 7 in the Senate — in many

24

particulars, concluded that it would leave no matter of

25

argument touching the language of Section 7 and

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

therefore the conferees inserted in the exclusion

2

proviso what would have been held as excluded in the

3

bill agreed to in the conference even if not put there,

4

to wit, banks, banking associations, and trust

5

companies, thus making it plain by the very expression

6

itself that they — and I believe "they" refers back to

7

the banks — that they along with the common carriers

8

were not within the group outlined as industrial

9

corporations.

10

And yet, in spite of both sides agreeing that

11

that's what the Conference Report did, although they

12

disagreed on the propriety of doing so, the Court of

13

Appeals, in its opinion reversing the District Court,

14

said, and I am quoting at the top of page 24-A of the

15

Appendix to our petition for certiorari, in the first

16

full sentence, the Court of Appeals said, but the

17

references in the exclusionary clause to banks and

18

common carriers do not have a common origin.

19

no basis for the assumption that they are to be read in

20

the same way.

21

There is

And the Court of Appeals went on to hold that

22

the phrase "other than banks" was to be read "other than

23

to banks," but the phrase "other than common carriers"

24

was to be read "other than one common carrier."

25

that's exactly opposite to what both sides agreed in the

these exchanges?
MR. SIMON:

Congressman Mann thought it was a bad thing.

And what

he expressly said in his argument, that if you let this

go through, it will permit a bank and United States

or a bank and a hat company to have common directors,

6

and I am against that.
And Congressmen Shirley and Webb didn't

disagree with him on what it did, but said that that was

9

within the scope of the conferees' authority, and the

10

Speaker agreed with him.
QUESTIONS

In other words, Mr. Mann wanted to

That debate took place shortly after Judge
Peckham's iecision in the District Court.

And

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Congressman St Germain took the floor of the House and

2

castigated Judge Peckham for his decision in this case,

3

said it was a totally wrong decision and it ought to be

4

reversed.

5

reversed Judge Peckham's decision.

And he offered an amendment which would have

6

The amendment was stricken, and to be sure, it

7

was stricken on a technicality, but a technicality which

8

could haved been cured and no member of the Congress, in

9

spite of Congressman St Germain's criticism of this

10

case, no member of the Congress offered a proper

11

amendment which would have overruled the decision.
I submit that this Court's decision in

12

1980 in

13

Merrill Lynch versus Curran and in — I am sorry, that

14

was in 1982 — and in 1980 in Seatrain versus Shell,

15

hold that while the views of subsequent Congresses

16

cannot overrule the unmistakable intent of the enacting

17

Congress, they are entitled to great weight where there

18

is any doubt of the intent of the enacting Congress.
Now, although the government now claims that

19
20

the statute prohibits these interlocks, they concede

21

that they made no effort for over 60 years to enforce

22

it, notwithstanding the fact that 40 percent of all

23

insurance company directors in America were bank

24

directors.

25

is that they were spending their time on voluntary

And the answer they give you in their brief

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

enforcement and they were trying to achieve the results

2

voluntarily.
Now, I have the greatest respect for the

3
4

Department of Justice, and I think if they were really

5

were trying to get voluntary enforcement of the statute,

6

there would not have been 40 percent of all insurance

7

company directors on bank boards at the time this case

8

was filed.

9

I suggest that they do not cite a single

10

instance where they persuaded an insurance or bank

11

director to voluntarily give up one of his

12

directorships.

13

And we know of none.

I also suggest that a more likely answer to

14

that situation is the holding of this Court in 1949 in

15

the Panhandle case where it held that the failure to use

16

such an important power for so long a time indicates a

17

belief that the power did not exist.

18

QUESTIONi

Mr. Simon, what liability does an

19

interlocking director subject himself to by remaining on

20

a board if the government is correct in its —

21

MR. SIMONj

None whatever. Justice Rehnquist.

22

No liability at all.

23

even if we are — if we are correct and we are sustained

24

by this Court, they also have no immunity from violating

25

the antitrust laws.

I might add, in addition, that

If a bank director and an insurance

1

company director sitting on a board conspire to do

2

something in violation of the Sherman Act, they are just

3

as subject to being indicted as anybody else.
QUESTION:

4

Well, doesn’t that detract from

5

your argument of 50 years of no prosecution or no

6

construction by the government?

7

really can't do anything anyway except voluntary, try to

8

get voluntary compliance,, it seems to me it negates all

9

but the administrative interpretation argument.
HR. SIHON*

10

If the government

Oh, Justice Rehnquist, there are a

11

number of cases where both the Justice Department and

12

the Federal Trade Commission have sued to force somebody

13

off a board.

14

thousands, but there are a great many cases.
QUESTION:

15
16

What is it, a declaratory judgment,

is it, or —
HR. SIMON:

17
18

When I say a number of cases, I don ’t mean

No, sir, it’s just a suit for an

injunction to enjoin —

19

QUESTION:

Injunction —

20

MR. SIMON:

— the man from serving on both

21

boards.

And as a matter of fact, it is the law at least

22

in the Seventh Circuit in an opinion by Justice Stevens

23

that either of the corporations can sue to get off their

24

board a man who is not legally sitting on -- who is

25

illegally sitting on two boards in violation of Section

8.

2

you sue for an injunction to enjoin the man from sitting

3

on the board.

4

Now, that case didn’t involve banking interlock, but

Fifteen months before this case was filed, the

5

assistant attorney general in charge of the Antitrust

6

Division of the Department of Justice, who filed this

7

case, made a public statement in which he said, and I

8

quote, "The Clayton Act section dealing with interlocks

9

may not be directly applicable to financial institutions

10

and insurance companies."

11

of a legislative problem than an enforcement problem."

12

And he added, "It may be more

In 1950 a report of the Federal Trade

13

Commission said flatly that this statute did not bar

14

bank-insurance company interlocks.

15

in 1974, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission

16

testified before Congress that the deficiencies pointed

17

out in their 1950 report still prevail.

18

And 25 years later,

In 1965 a staff report of the House Judiciary

19

Committee, and in 1968 a staff report of the House

20

Banking Committee both alluded to the fact that these

21

interlocks were not covered.

22

particularly significant in light of the bills that I

23

referred to earlier in this time frame where Congress

24

refused to enact legislation that would have barred

25

these interlocks.

And I think that’s

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, ESQ.,

14

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RESPONDENT

MR. XNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
This Court is familiar with the background of

18

the enactment of the Clayton Act.

19

passed in 1914 to supplement the Sherman Act and to

20

correct perceived deficiencies in the Sherman Act.

21

was intended to arrest in their incipiency conspiracies

22

and monopolies and trusts that would be anticompetitive

23

and to arrest them before their consummation.

24
25

That statute was

It

Section 8 of the Clayton Act, which is at
issue in this case, is part of that overall statutory

1

scheme.

2

directorates between competing corporations is likewise

3

intended to arrest anticompetitive conduct in its

4

incipiency.

5

Its prohibition against interlocking

Congress was aroused by the fact that

6

concentration of control by a few individuals over the

7

great corporations of the -- of the country may have led

8

to anticompetitive situations among corporations that

9

should have been in unrestrained and active

10

competition.

Congress feared that the interlocking

11

directorates would lead to uniform policies among those

12

corporations that should have been competing and that

13

they may have led to joint action against third parties.

14

Congress was also specifically concerned about

15

the concentration of control over capital.

16

therefore, was designed to nip in the bud the possible

17

antitrust violations that could arise in this setting.

18

Section 8,

Now, as the Committee Reports on the bill

19

explain. Congress emphatically rejected the suggestion

20

that there were not enough men in the country qualified

21

to serve on the boards of directors of the great

22

corporations and that these interlocking directors

23

should be permitted to continue for that reason.

24
25

To the contrary. Congress concluded following
on the views of the President, that the implementation

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of Section 8 would in fact bring new people into the

2

boards and would bring new initiatives and new ideas.

3

And Congress concluded that the notion that there are

4

not enough people to go around on the boards of

5

directors was contrary to our institutions.

QUESTION;

6
7

no disagreement with anything you have said so far?
MR. KNEEDLER;

8
9

I take it, Mr. Kneedler, there is

That's — that's correct, Mr.

Justice Blackmun.

10

QUESTION;

All right.

11

MR. KNEEDLER;

In this case, the petitioners,

12

as Counsel has indicated, stipulated that the banks and

13

insurance companies involved in this case are

14

corporations engaged in commerce and that they are

15

competitors, principally, in the extension of real

16

estate and mortgage loans.

17

The Court of Appeals pointed out that the

18

substantiality of the potential competition perhaps

19

affected by this case is indicated by stipulations that

20

in 1975 the three banks had outstanding real estate

21

loans of about 56 billion and the insurance companies

22

involved had outstanding real estate loans of about $32

23

billion.

24
25

Indeed, petitioners have stipulated in this
case that the competition between the banks and

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

insurance companies is not insubstantial and that they

2

have in effect admitted for purposes of this litigation

3

that an agreement between them to eliminate -- to

4

eliminate that competition would violate the antitrust

5

laws, as that principle is used in Section 8.
Now, those -- although these prerequisites for

6

7

the application of paragraph 4 of Section 8 are

8

satisfied in this case, petitioners nevertheless contend

9

that they — that the interlocks between banks and

10

insurance companies are exempt from the coverage of

11

paragraph 4,

12

"other than banks, banking associations, and trust

13

companies."

They rely on the phrase in that paragraph

The question presented here is whether this

14
15

phrase, which makes no mention of the insurance

16

companies that petitioners claim are exempt by virtue of

17

their interlock with the banks, whether this phrase

18

should be construed to be limited to the banking

19

institutions that are expressly mentioned in that phrase

20

or whether it should be construed more broadly to exempt

21

from coverage interlocks between a bank and insurance

22

company.

23

Now, the statutory presumptions governing the

24

recognition of exemptions from the antitrust laws are

25

well established under this Court* decisions.

We think

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that there are three principles that are especially

2

pertinent here.

3

the antitrust laws are to be liberally construed and

4

correspondingly that exemptions from those laws are to

5

be narrowly construed.

6

First is the -- is the basic one/ that

QUESTION;

Well, how much weight does that

7

really bear in a closed case, Nr. Kneedler?

I mean if

8

you applied that generally, I suppose you’d say anytime

there is an arguable point to be made for the

10

government, the courts ought to decide in favor of the

11

12

13
14

I — I don’t see that carries a lot of weight
in a case like this.
MR. KNEEDLER;

Well, I think, Mr. Justice

15

Rehnguist, that this Court has treated it as a starting

16

point of analysis, and that’s the — that’s the point

17

that I am making here.

18

viewed those principles as applying equally where there

19

is an express exemption as we have here as well as where

20

there is an implied exemption.

21

QUESTION;

And also that the Court has

Well, it seems to me Justice

22

Rehnquist’s point is especially significant when, what

is it, 60 years has gone by with one position on the

part of the government in this area and now the

25

Well, the -- as I say, the --

8

there was not enforcement action under -- under most

9

circumstances under the Clayton Act.

In fact, the 1965

10

staff report that is cited in the briefs has statistics

11

on the enforcement both by the Federal Trade Commission

12

and by the Justice Department, at page 227, in which

13

that indicates that there was no systematic enforcement

14

program by the Justice Department at all until after

15

World War II.

And in fact, the first suit that eventually

17

went to a judgment in one of these cases was not even

Rehnquist
I would point out too that the situation we

2

3

have here is not unlike that before the Court in the

4

duPont case, which involved the question of whether

5

vertical acquisitions are covered by Section 7.

6

case the Court pointed out that there likewise had been

7

a period of 35 years of nonenforcement against vertical

8

mergers.

9

In that

And also the Federal Trade Commission in fact

10

had gone on record as saying that the vertical

11

acquisitions were not covered, and yet the Court

12

construed the Section 7 as applicable in that

13

circumstance.

14

And likewise in the Philadelphia National Bank

15

case, the Court noted that the Justice Department had —

16

itself had expressed doubt after the — even after the

17

passage of the 1950 amendments that the particular form

18

of acquisition or merger in that case was not covered.

19

And yet that did not deter the Court.

20

So in the absence of some more affirmative

21

showing of a contemporaneous judgment that these,

22

interlocks such as this, were not intended to be reached

23

by Congress, we think that the absence of that is not

24

controlling.

25

And I think that I would also like to

as being, and especially the basis for overturning a

2

statutory interpretation especially — about which the

3

Court should be especially cautious.

4

And particularly, the efforts that Counsel

5

focuses on from 1965 on, a period that is 50 years after

6

the passage of the Clayton Act, Congress* failure to act

7

one way or another in that period, in fact, even in the

decades prior to that, comes so long after the Clayton

Act that it's difficult to attribute Congress* actions

so much later to the intent of the enacting Congress.
If I could return for a moment to the

presumptions governing the recognition of exemptions

are two other —

think — do you think there is any merit to Mr. Simon's

argument that this really isn't an exemption, it’s a

question of how you define the offense, because if you

21

said all corporations except banks in the first clause,

22

that wouldn't be an exemption, would it?

as essentially a semantic difference.

grain of the — of the principal prohibition, which

16

support that gave rise to it was -- was -- reflected a

congressional intent broadly to attack these

24

separate regulation of banks and no broader, then you

25

have a comprehensive package which both gives effect to

And if one reads the "other

1

the purpose of not having inconsistent treatment of

2

banks and also gives effect to the broad congressional

3

purpose to recognize — to prohibit these interlocks.
On the other hand, if you give the

4
5

interpretation which petitioners urge, you have an

6

exemption for banks and insurance companies based on a

7

clause that doesn’t even mention insurance companies,

8

situations that are concededly within the policy of what

9

Congress was focusing on in terms of competing

10

corporations and, therefore, cutting against the grain.

11

So I think in that respect, the analysis is largely the

12

same.

13

This — this brings me to the second of the

14

points dealing with the presumption.

15

Congress has provided for an exemption from the

16

antitrust laws for an entity within a particular

17

business, this Court has been reluctant to extend that

18

immunity or exemption to arrangements between the

19

corporations and the industry and other entities outside.

20

Ordinarily, when

Well, here we have another situation in that

21

— in that category where the -- the clause in question

22

is said to provide immunity not only for the banking

23

institutions mentioned but also for insurance companies.

24
25

And thirdly, that this Court has generally
recognized that where there is an antitrust immunity,

35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that’s ordinarily predicated on the existence of some

2

regulatory authority elsewhere to protect the public

3

interest against the sort of abuses that the antitrust

4

laws would otherwise bar.

5

And in this situation, if the — if the clause

6

upon which petitioners rely is limited to banks, then --

7

than that pattern is sustained here because interlocks

8

between banking institutions are in fact separately

9

regulated.

They are separately regulated by the initial

10

paragraphs of — of Section 8 itself, and now more

11

recently in 1978 they are separately regulated by the

12

Depository Institution Interlocks Act.

13

So on the — on the other hand, the interlocks

14

between banks and insurance companies that we have

15

involved in this case are not separately regulated by

16

the initial paragraphs or by the Bank Interlocks Act,

17

although there was an amendment offered in 1978 to -- to

18

extend the coverage to include bank-insurance company

19

interlocks after the District Court’s decision in this

20

case, that was rejected not on the merits but because it

21

was not — it was not germane to the bill and would have

22

been under the Judiciary — Judiciary Committee's

23

jurisdiction.

24

And along the same lines with the analysis on

25

an exemption from the antiturst laws, we think that the

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

analysis that — that we urge the Court to adopt is

2

supported by looking at the structure of the act.

3

passed, the initial paragraphs of Section 8 cover

4

interlocks between banking institutions with certain

5

carefully crafted exceptions showing that where Congress

6

wants to accept intelocks even in that category, it has

7

done so.

8

9

As

The succeeding paragraph contains the general
prohibition against interlocks between competing

10

corporations generally, limited only by the phrase we

11

have here and the common — other than common carriers.

12

Now, it’s significant that the substantive

13

standards in the initial paragraphs of Section 8 are

14

different from those in the — in the fourth paragraph.

15

As initially enacted, for example, the banking

16

paragraphs barred interlocks only where one of the

17

institutions had capital or paid-in surplus exceeding £5

18

million, which is a figure considerably higher than the

19

— than the $1 million figure necessary to trigger

20

paragraph 4.

21

And there was also a prohibition against

22

interlocks in cities of 200,000 or more without regard

23

to the amount of capital.

24

contrast, the — the standards were somewhat different.

25

The initial paragraphs covered more than simply

Under paragraph 4, in

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

directors, they covered interlocks between other

2

officials.

Paragraph 4 just covered directors.
And even though, as Counsel for petitioners

3
4

points out, the act was amended, the initial banking

5

paragraphs of the act were amended over the years.

6

now they contain different standards prohibiting the

7

interlocks than those now in paragraph 4.

Even

So we — we submit that the natural reading of

8
9

the phrase upon which petitioners rely here is that it

10

serves to ensure that the bank — bank interlocks that

11

are governed by initial paragraphs are not also subject

12

by the somewhat inconsistent standards in paragraph 4.
And those same, as I mentioned before, the

13
14

structure of the act also suggests that Congress

15

legislated in paragraph 4 generally with respect to

16

interlocks and in addition legislated with respect to

17

banks because of a concern over the concentration of

18

capital.

19

If you put those together, the structure does

20

not suggest an intent nevertheless to exempt interlocks

21

that somehow fall between the cracks of the two.

22

yet, that's essentially what petitioners urge here.

23

because they do not, as the Court of Appeals and the

24

Federal Trade Commission in its parallel Perpetual case

25

found, there is no indication that Congress carefully

1

considered the situation of interlocks between banks and

2

competing non-banks and decided that they should be

3

exempt from the — affirmatively decided that they

4

should be exempt from the antitrust laws for some reason

5

that justified an exception to the general policy.
Now, it may be that in 1914, when Congress was

6

7

enacting the Clayton Act, that many of the members did

8

not believe that banks were engaged in commerce or that

9

insurance companies were engaged in commerce.

This

10

Court had so held in Nathan versus Louisiana and in Paul

11

Burke versus Virginia with respect to banking and

12

insurance.

13

And so therefore, the Congress that enacted

14

this statute may not have been thinking of paragraph 4

15

as reaching those sorts of interlocks between banks and

16

insurance companies or one or the other.

17

But this Court made clear in Southeastern

18

Underwriters that the — even — even though the

19

enacting Congress may not have anticipated that this

20

Court would subsequently rule that in that case

21

insurance is part of commerce, that that did not mean

22

that the language in the statute Congress enacted should

23

be limited in that fashion.

24
25

And that same principle was applied to banks
and specifically to the Clayton Act in the Philadelphia

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

National Bank case, where the Court noted in a footnote

2

that the banks there didn't even challenge the

3

proposition that they were engaged in commerce, citing

4

the Court of Appeals decision in Transamerica where the

5

Court had engaged in the same analysis under the Clayton

6

Act, that even though the — the Congress that passed

7

the Clayton Act may not have anticipated that banks were

8

part of commerce, that as that language was expanded or

9

the interpretation of that language was expanded then

10
11

too the application of the act should..
And in fact, the Section 7 of the Clayton Act

12

refers to corporations engaged in commerce in language

13

that is directly parallel to paragraph 4 of Section 8.

14

I would like to address then, just in

15

conclusion, the discussion of the debate on the

16

Conference Report.

17

particularly reading the statute against its -- its

18

purposes and the structure of the act, that — that it

19

would be particularly unwise to rely on scattered pieces

20

of discussion in the legislative history —

actual interpretation of the written enacted language

MR. KNEEDLER:

What I

am — what I am saying is that the Court has used it as

10

a -- as a guide to defining the intent of Congress where

11

Congress has enacted a broad statute as the Sherman Act

prohibition should be liberally construed to effectuate

Congress’ purpose as — as remedial statutes generally

are.
