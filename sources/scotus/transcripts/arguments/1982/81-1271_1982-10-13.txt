CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Adler, you may now

5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD ADLER, JR., ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. ADLER;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

8 may it please the Court;
9

We are asking the Court to reverse a judgment

10 of theCourt of Appeals
11

that upheld a district court

judgment finding that Falls City had violated the

12 Robinson-Patman Act in its sales of beer to the
13 respondent .Vanco, which was a distributor of Falls City
14 and other beers in Evansville, Indiana.
15

It is our position, and the United States in

16 the Federal Trade Commission agreed, that the lower
17 courts applied a legally erroneous interpretation of
18 Section 2(b) of the Robinson-Patman Act in rejecting
19 Falls City’s good faith meeting competition defense.
20

We also contend that the lower courts

21 misapprehended this Court’s Morton Salt decision and
22 applied an overly lenient test of competitive injury
23 under Section 2(a) of the act.
24

I expect, unless there are questions, to rest

25 on our brief on the Section 2(a) competitive injury

3

1

point, and in the time I have in oral argument to

2 address the meeting competition issue.

3

QUESTION!

4 that, counsel.

Well, I do have a question about

Do you agree there’s one market in this

5 case, or do you think there are two?
6

MR. ADLER*

I think there — I think the court

7 erred in finding a single market, but I think at the
8 posture of the case in this Court there was a failure to

9 prove competitive injury, even assuming a single market.
10
11

QUESTION;

Well, do you think the question

whether there is one or two markets is relevant to the

12 competitive injury issue?

13

MR. ADLER*

Oh, I think it’s a very important

14 issue, and if — if there were not a single market -15 that is, if the wholesalers in the two markets were not
16 in competition with each other -- these would not be
17 actionable, discriminatory sales under Section 2(a).
18 But even to some degree they are in competition with
19 each other, there are still many other matters that the
20 plaintiff would have to prove regarding causal
21

connection between the price differential and the kind

22 of injury to competition and the kind of business injury

23 that is actionable.
24

QUESTION*

Well, Mr. Adler, I guess both the

25 district court found one market and the Court of Appeals

U

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

affirmed.

Is that a — whether or not there's one or

2 two markets, is that a question of fact or law?

3

MR. ADLER;

4 mixed question.

I think that is somewhat of a

Our problem with the 2(a)

case is that

5 the court, both courts, and particularly most explicitly
6

the Court of Appeals, articulated a standard of injury

7 based on a misapprehension of Morton Salt under which
8 injury was virtually presumed.

And so it didn't make

9 the kind of careful analysis of market factors.
10
11

QUESTION;

But if there were two markets here

there wouldn’t be any Robinson --

12

MR. ADLER;

13

QUESTION;

There would be no Robinson-Patman. .
No.

Then that would be the end of

14 the case, wouldn't it?
15

MR. ADLER;

And that would certainly be —

16 that would be one way the case could have ended and
17 should have ended.
18

QUESTION;

Well, if that’s so, I don't

19 understand why you don’t argue the question of whether
20 there are one or two markets.
21

22

If it's a question of

law, and we may, notwithstanding the current finding —
MR. ADLER;

Well, I think there are many

23 factual components in that, and I think in our posture —
24

QUESTION;

Well, you're not willing to argue

25 that there are two markets.

1

MR. ADLERs

I’m not asking this Court to delve

2 into the record to second-guess that determination by

3 the lower courts.
4

QUESTIONS

You didn'-f address it in your

5 petition either, did you?
6

MR. ADLER:

Only as part of the whole complex

7 of factors that the court failed adequately to consider
8 because of its simplistic view of what’s required on

9 proof of injury under 2(a).

Had the lower courts done

10 as this Court said in Standard Oil and made a real
11

appraisal of competitive facts, we would have prevailed

12 on the market issue;

we would have prevailed on all

13 kinds of causation issue.

And on 2(a) I think

14 realistically the courts, lower courts, Seventh Circuit,
15 should be instructed that they cannot presume injury and
16 that they should make a searching analysis of the fact
17 to see whether the requisite injury is shown.
18

The courts -- the Morton Salt, we have no

19 objection to it per se, but we think it is — has been
20 misapplied.
21

The standards are too lenient.

The courts

find injury, find single markets, find effects on

22 competition without the requisite analysis of the

23 competitive facts, and that is made in our brief.
24

I would like to address the meeting

25 competition issue which presupposes that there was a

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

prima facie case of injury.

We don't think that there

2 was, but assuming for the purpose of argument that there
3 was a prima facie case of injury, we believe that the
4 lower courts erred — and this is strictly a matter of
5

law — in the legal standard, in the things that they

6

thought were required in order to establish a good faith

7 meeting competition defense.
8

The Robinson-Patman —

9

QUESTION.’

May I just ask one other case?

10 Then your submission is that we should assume for
11

purposes of analyzing the good faith defense that the

12 law required as a prima facie matter your client to
13 charge the same price in Kentucky and Indiana..
14

MR. ADLERs

15

QUESTION;

16 2(b)
17

No, sir.

No, sir.

Well, then, how will we get to the

defense?
Don't you assume a violation first and then

18 say we can defend against -19

MR. ADLERs

I assume a violation — I assume

20 -- for purposes of arguing the good faith meeting
21

competition —

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. ADLERs

Correct.

That’s what I mean.

I assume a violation, which the

24 Court said in Standard Oil.

Even assuming a prima facie

25 violation, this Court --

2 were under a duty to charge the same price in Kentucky

3 and Indiana.

MR. ADLER;

QUESTION;

Correct.
— Argument.
Except for — unless you can defend

10 that under 2(b).
11

MR. ADLER;

Yes.

The sole question on 2(b) is

12 whether the different price,

even though assuming for

13 analytical purposes that it created a prima facie
14 violation —
15

QUESTION;

16 that today.
17

Right.

You said you don’t argue

You’re going to assume that.

MR. ADLER;

I’m going to assume that for

18 purposes of the Section 2(b) argument.
19

20 suggesting.
21

Right.

Which, in turn, is all I’m

You are therefore assuming for the purpose

of the argument you’re about to make —

22

MR. ADLER;

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
— That you are under a duty, a

24 statutory duty, to charge the same price in Kentucky and
25 Indiana.

— Meeting lower prices of

This whole matter arose because of an

industrywide practice of not only Falls City but all

8 brewers of charging different prices to their
9

distributors in different states.

10 that practice.
11

practice.

12 this.
13

Falls City followed

Vanco’s other suppliers followed that

All brewers did.

And there’s no dispute on

The court expressly found that other brewers had

different prices for their distributors in the Kentucky

14 portion of the relevant market that were lower than
15

the

prices they had in Indiana.
Faced with that industrywide situation, the

16
17

question is what practical alternatives did Falls City

18

have.

19

the competition — the discrimination by either raising

The district court said it should have eliminated

20 the price or lowering the price; that is, raising its
21

price — excuse me -- lowering the price in Indiana to

22 the Kentucky level or else raising the Kentucky price so
23 that it would be equal to the Indiana price.
24
25

This was not — these are not really workable
alternatives.

This was not anything that any other

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

brewer did.

It would have meant because Indiana law

2 requires all wholesalers to be charged the same price

3 that Falls City would have had to undercut, underprice
4 below its competitors throughout the state of Indiana,
5 not just to Vanco.

And Falls City president testified

6 that would be economically disadvantageous,

and there is

7 no obligation to price — in a free market system to
8 price below your competition.

9

The alternative of pricing in Kentucky at the

10 higher Indiana level would, of course,
11

have put Falls

City above its competition, and this is precisely what

12 we believe Section 2(b) is intended to avoid — the

13 problem of a competitor being forced to price above the
14 competition, above the price level of its competition.
15

Judge Schweigert in his dissent found a much

16 better answer*

charge — for Falls City — charge the

17 Indiana price, which was a free market normal price,
18 charge the lower price in Kentucky because that was
19 necessary to beat the competition there; and he said
20 that's the essence of a good faith meeting of
21
22

competition defense.
I think that's in line with what this Court

23 has repeatedly said with regard to Section 2(b), that
24 it’s a pragmatic — that good faith is a pragmatic and
25 flexible concept and so forth.

And the pragmatic and

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

sensible approach here was for Falls City to do what it

2 did, follow the Indiana price, follow the Kentucky

3 price, be competitive in both areas with the brands that
4 it followed which were the nonpremium, popular-priced
5 type of brands, which indeed it followed through market
6 information and the like, as was abundantly testified to

7 during the trial.
Vanco now contends that the good faith meeting

8

9 of competition question was, I quote, "a pure question
10 of fact.”
11

But in the Court of Appeals it argued to the

court extensively, about five pages of its brief, under

12 the heading that the proffered defense was contrary to

13 settled law.
14

And it argued to the court two propositions:

15 Section 2(b) does not apply unless there is
16 customer-by-customer pricing; that the use of a price
17 system is not meeting competition as contemplated by
18 2(b) .
19

It also argued that the meeting of competition

20 defense depends upon a lowering of prices;
21

that you are

not meeting competition if you are unable to raise

22 prices because of competition; there must be an actual

23 price decrease.
24

We submit that there’s no difference in the

25 law or in logic or in economics or anything else between

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

lowering a price to meet competition and being unable to

2 raise a price, as Falls City was unable to raise its
3 Kentucky price because had it raised it would not have
4 been competitive.
5
6 argument.

The Court of Appeals accepted Vanco's legal
Its rejection of the 2(b) defense proffered

7 by Falls City rested on two pivotal and we believe
8 clearly erroneous legal propositions.

One is that

9 Section 2(b) does not justify price differences that
10 result mere-ly from the adoption of a competitor's
11 discriminatory pricing structure; that the act places
12 emphasis on individual situations and doesn’t apply to
13 the adoption of an overall pricing structure.
14

Secondly -- the second proposition that the

15 court articulated was that the -- 2(b) didn't apply
16 because the discriminatory pricing resulted not from —
17 from price increases in Indiana, not from price
18 decreases; and that there was nothing in the record to
19 show that Falls City had a price structure and then
20 reduced its prices -- this is the court’s word -21 reduced its prices where necessary to defend against
22 competition.
23

So that contrary to what Vanco has said, the

24 rejection of the 2(b) defense rested clearly on two
25 legal propositions, both of which are erroneous, both of

12
AIDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

which depart from past interpretations of 2(b) by this

2 Court, both of which are antithetical to the notion that
3 you should accommodate the
4 other goals of antitrust,

Robinson-Patman Act with
the procompetitive goals.

And

5 it resulted in an interpretation that prevented Falls

6 City and would prevent others from being competitive,
7 i.e., maintaining its lower competitive price in
8

Kentucky.

9

QUESTION!

Hr. Adler, did the court not also

10 find as a matter of fact that your client raised its
11

prices in Indiana not for competitive reasons but for

12 other reasons, and

what do we do with a factual finding

13 like that?

MR. ADLERs

14

The only factual finding that

15 could be made is that of course Falls City raised its
16 prices in Indiana when competition permitted.

this -- and there’s no two ways about it,

there’s no finding to the contrary — was that Falls

And that's how

2 the difference arose.
3

And one can look, at it and say okay, the

The differential arose because it was faced

6 with different competitive circumstances in the two
7 areas — lower prices in Kentucky, higher pricers in
8 Indiana.
9

It was a price taker and price follower in

both circumstances.
Vanco here now is making a big attack on the

10
11

good faith and the reasonableness of Falls City’s

12 pricing practices.

It makes, as we showed in our reply

13 brief, a rather minimal attempt

to defend the legal

14 theories which it successfully persuaded the Court of
15 Appeals to

adopt, and it seeks now to, for example, cast

16 a taint of illegality on Falls City's pricing saying
17 that it was engaged in
18 pricing,
19

parallel pricing, collusive

noncompetitive pricing and the like.
But the court expressly found that there was

20 no agreement on price fixing;
21

price fixing.

it rejected the claim of

And those allegations I think are

22 totally, totally without legal significance.

prices in all of its markets.

There are other points made by the respondent

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

regarding Falls City’s pricing.

They say, for example,

2 that it didn *t show anything about the competitive
3 analysis that led it to adopt lower prices in Kentucky.
4

But the record is unequivocal that Falls City got

5 pricing information

through its sales and from

6 distributors and others? that it made every reasonable
7 effort that a business in this position would make to
8 keep abreast of competitive conditions,

and using that

9 information it set these prices.
10
11

I would like to reserve the balance of my time
for rebuttal.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

13

QUESTION;

Hr. Shapiro.

Hr. Shapiro, before you start,

14 would you mini, do you think it's open to the Court to
15 address the question whether there are one or two
16 m arkets?

HR. ADLER;

17

I think it’s open the Court, but

18 it isn’t the question presented in the petition, and it
19 hasn’t been briefed by the parties,

although this Court

20 certainly could entertain that issue if it

21

were disposed

to do so.

22

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,

23

AS AMICUS CURIAE

24

MR. SHAPIRO;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

25 please the Court;

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The Department of Justice and the Federal

2 Trade Commission agree with Petitioner that the Seventh
3 Circuit used the wrong legal standard when it rejected
4 the meeting competition defense raised in this case.

We

5 therefore submit that the decision of the Court of
6 Appeals is in error and should be reversed.

7

Both tha Seventh Circuit and the District

8 Court believe that the meeting competition defense was
9 unavailable because the price difference here resulted
10 from uneven price increases rather than some
11

identifiable price decrease.

12 it necessary

The courts below thought

to find some lowering of prices in the

13 state of Kentucky before the defense could be sustained.
14

This holding finds no support in the literal

15 language of the statute.

Section 2(b) only requires the

16 seller to show that his lower price was made in good
17 faith to meet competition, not that he lowered his price
18 compared to some pre-existing standard.
19

In our view, the Court of Appeals* departure

20 from the statute’s literal requirements threatens to
21

undermine an important statutory purpose.

During

22 periods of general inflation price competition often may
23 take the form of moderate price increases rather than
24 outright price cuts.

In this situation the lower price

25 of the seller, even though it is the end product of a

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

moderate price increase, may well be a form of

2 competitive self-defense of the very kind which Congress

3 meant to protect.
4

In addition, if the law really did require

5 what the Court of Appeals said, then sellers like Falls
6 City would be enforced

to engage in costly and

7 artificial conduct such as hiking all of their prices to
8 a particular level for a period of time and then cutting

9 selectively certain prices thereafter.

This would serve

10 no useful purpose and would only aggravate the problem
11

of inflation in our economy.

12

The district court also was of the view that

13 the meeting competition defense requires proof that
14 prices were adjusted on a customer-by-customer basis,
15 and in affirming the district court, the Court of
16 Appeals used language indicating that it was of this
17 same view.
18

This also was a mistaken interpretation of the

19 statute.

Section 2(b) permits a price difference if the

20 seller shows that his lower price to a purchaser or to a
21

group of purchasers was made in good faith to meet the

22 price of a rival.

The test, as this Court frequently

23 has held, is flexible and pragmatic, not technical or
24 doctrinaire.

The seller need only show a reasonable and

25 good faith effort to meet the forces of competition.

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The statute doesn't attempt to dictate what method the

2 seller must use in different market situations.
3

Nothing in the statute or its legislative

4 history says that a seller cannot adopt an areawide
5 price when that's reasonably necessary to meet actual

6 competition.

As the facts of this case show, the

7 seller’s rival may have a single price of its own
8 throughout the entire region, or a group of sellers of
9 slightly different products -may have a range of prices.
10 In either event, a single price which is reasonably
11

adjusted to meet actual competition prevailing in the

12 area is a

permissible response.

13

Customer-by-customer pricing often would be a

14 complete waste of time when a larger rival charges a
15 single price throughout the area and could impose
16 substantial burdens on small sellers attempting to
17 survive in a competitive market environment.
18

Now, contrary to the view of the Court of

19 Appeals, nothing in

this Court's decision in the Staley

20 case requires a rejection of Falls City's meeting
21

competition defense here.

Staley rested on the

22 conclusion that the sellers there lacked good faith
23 because they copied an artificial basing point system
24 which imposed substantial phantom or unearned freight
25 charges on particular purchasers.

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The court concluded that the basing point

2 system was inherently unlawful under the Robinson-Patman
3

Act, and therefore its adoption could not be

4

characterized as good faith action.
In addition, the FTC explained in its opinion

5

6 in the Staley case that the basing point system was the
7

product of collusion, and that also undercut any claim

8 of good faith action.

Now, in this case, by contrast —

HR. SHAPIRO:

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CUSACKi

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

22 may it please the Court:
23
24 Court.

This case presents two questions for the
The first is was the district court and the

25 Seventh Circuit in affirming the district court clearly

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

erroneous in making two factual findings which are key

2 to this case.
3

The first question if whether Falls City

4

sustained its burden — and its burden of showing that

5

its persisent and substantial, from 10 to 29 percent,

6 price discrimination throughout the entire period
7

8
9

resulted from its good faith attempt to meet competition.
The second question presented by this case is
whether Vanco established competitive injury when it

10

showed it lost volume and profits, even in light of the

11

fact that it absorbed substantial price increases by

12

Falls City, and it lost these profits and lost these

13

sales due to Falls City's persistent and substantial

14

price discrimination.

15

In regard to the meeting competition question,

16

one, Falls City never competed on the basis of price.

17

And this was found by the district court and affirmed by

18

the Court of Appeals.

19

"was not meeting competition.

Judge Holder said that Falls City
Its action was to get a

20 higher price in Indiana than in Kentucky."
21

The Seventh

Circuit said that Section 2(b) "is designed to allow a

22 seller to defend against genuine price competition."
23

And that the district court found that Falls City in

24

setting its Indiana price was simply taking advantage of

25

its competitor's policies of charging higher prices in

26

Indiana than in Kentucky and other states.

2

And I've got to say it to this Court, the

3

testimony of Mr. Tate was that in the thirteen states

4

where they sold beer, the price was higher in Indiana

5 than anywhere else,

and he guessed that all brewers

6 charged a higher price in Indiana than somewhere else.
7

And I am appalled that the amicus could take the side of

8 Falls City under these circumstances.

The Court of Appeals also said that the

9

10 findings of
11

the district court are not clearly erroneous

and "There is nothing in the record to show that Falls

12 City first adopted a nondiscriminatory pricing structure
13 and

then reduced its prices when necessary to defend

14 against competition."

22 Indiana prices.
23
24 the

And I'd like to point out to the Court that
Indiana law, the one-price law, applies to sales of

25 liquor as well as beer.

Why is it that liquor was

31
AIDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

cheaper in Indiana than in Kentucky while beer was so

2 much more?

It was an artificially set price.

3 Virginia is a one-price state.

West

West Virginia was priced

4 cheaper by Falls City than Indiana.

Why is Indiana

5 discriminated against?
6

It’s clear, it seems to me, the price system

7 in this case I submit is simply this:

the system by

8 which Falls City and its brewer competitors,

with the

9 noticeable exception of Drury’s, continuously charged a

10 higher price in Indiana than they did in other states.
11

The evidence shows that Falls City was not

12 meeting competition in good faith, was never interested
13 in competing on the basis of price, nor ever competed on
14 the basis of price, and never set up a nondiscriminatory
15 pricing structure as commanded by the statute.
16

And when Falls City received any pressure in

17 regard to its high and discriminatory prices in Indiana
18 such as in

1973 with the attempt by the principal of

19 Vanco to get the Indiana legislature to pass a law that
20 brewers would not charge higher prices to Indiana

21 distributors than it did to distributors in adjoining
22 states, or the threat of the pendency of this lawsuit
23 and the institution of this lawsuit,
24 to its major brewers,

Falls City turned

competitors, members of the United

25 States Brewers Association, for help in order to

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

perpetuate this persistent and substantial price

2 discrimination.
3

How is that possibly in good faith?

Contrary to the repeated testimony from Mr.

4 Tate, and he told Judge Holder that, "I have never ever
5 known a small brewery our size to step out and lead the
6 parade” — in reference to prices — and he told Mr.
7 Adler, "We sort of followed along what Pabst and Stroh
8 did in most cases."
9

And it’s not refuted by Falls City in its

10 reply brief.

Falls City led off at least one price

11 increase in Indiana, the July 1974 price increase, on
12 which day Falls City also increased prices in Kentucky.
13 And, incidentally. Falls City never really showed who
14 the leading brewers were in Kentucky, but a document
15 submitted by Mr. Tate in evidence shows that from 1962
16 to 1969 Falls City was the leading brewer in Kentucky.
17 And this cry that they're so small and put upon I think
18 should be evaluated in that light.
19

2UESTI0N:

Well, I took that to mean small in

20 relation to the giants, not to the locals.
21

MR. CUSACK:

But large. Your Honor, in

22 relation to the market; large in relation to where they
23 were selling beer; large in relation to Kentucky,
24 southern Indiana, parts of Ohio, Tennessee, West
25 Virginia.

It was a regional brewer which had

As I say, number one

3

it dropped from '70 — in *71 to second place, and

4 that's as far as the statistics go.
5

Your Honor, the Court — and may it please the

6 Court, the Court in Staley said
7 was then — and,

— and it's true as it

incidentally, the thrust of our

8 argument in the Seventh Circuit was the Staley case,
9 which we think is the finest decision by the Court in
10 regard to good faith meeting competition — that you
11

cannot meet competition by following the higher prices

12 of your competitors.
13

In Staley the Court said — this Court said

14 the statutory test is whether respondents by their
15 basing point system

adopted a lower price in good faith

16 to meet an equally low price of a competitor.

This test

17 presupposes that the person charged with violating the
18 act would by his normal nondiscriminatory pricing
19 methods have reached a price so high he would reduce it
20 in order to meet the competitor’s equally low price.
21

Instead they, Staley, maintained their own prices at a

22 level of the competitor's high price based upon the
23 competitor's high cost of delivery by including phantom
24 freight in their own delivered prices.
25

Vanco is a better case than Staley.

There are

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

no cost savings in southern Indiana over

in Indiana

2 over the twelve other states where Falls City sold beer,
3

as Mr. Tate stated that his costs were identical in all

4

states.

5

identity of his competitors in both states were

He also said in regard to that that the

6 practically identical.

A footnote in Staley states that the chairman

7

8 of the House conferees on the Robinson-Patman Act had
9

presented a conference report emphasized with

10

illustrations that the 2(b) procedural provision cannot

11

be construed as a carte blanche exemption — exception

12 to violate the bill so long as a competitor can be shown
13

to have violated it first, nor so long as that

14

competition cannot be met without the use of oppressive

15

discriminations in violation of the obvious intent of

16

the bill.

17

In Staley the Court also stated the

18 Commission’s conclusions in
19 competition

regard to the meeting

defense "It seems inescapable that Staley’s

20 discriminations such as those between purchasers in
21

Chicago and Decatur were established not to meet equally

22 low Chicago prices of competitors there, but in order to
23 establish elsewhere
24

the artificially high prices whose

discriminatory effect permeates respondent's entire

25 pricing system."

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Lastly, the Court said, "We cannot say that a

2 seller acts in good faith when it chooses to adopt such
r

3

a clearly discriminatory pricing system, at least where

4

it never attempted to set up a nondiscriminatory system.

7

competitors' high prices, did not — and did not meet

would by his normal, nondiscriminatory pricing methods

have reached a price so high that he'd reduce it in

QUESTION;

Hr. Cusack?

13

MR. CUSACK:

14

QUESTIONi

Yes, sir.
Don’t you think the Court in Staley

15

gave some weight to the fact that Staley had throughout

16

its entire pricing structure the element of phantom

17

freight built in, so there was kind of a unitary price

18

structure?

19

HR. CUSACK;

Yes, Your Honor, but the

20 interesting thing about it is they admitted -- the Court
21

in Staley also said that some of the phantom freight —

22 there was some phantom freight and there was some valid
23

freight, and they've got that chart in there where some

24

of the prices were perfectly fair.

Although there may be some health

In regard to the second question before the

whether Vanco established competitive injury when

14 it showed it lost volume and lost profits, the following
15 is crucial,

and the Morton Salt case is a red herring.

16 The Court did not infer competitive injury.

The Court

17 found competitive injury based on substantial evidence.
18 Vanco absorbed substantial

price increases by Falls

19 City, as was specifically found by the district court.
20 Vanco's customers,

21

the Evansville retailers, lost

substantial business from their regular customers by

22 their purchasing beer in Kentucky.

The district court

23 and the court of appeals both found

that there was

24 competitive injury.

I must go back, as I have — we have repeated

3 Falls City's own documents,

documents by Mr. Schneider,

4 who they never bothered to call at trial to rebut it,
5 never bothered to call at trial, and he worked for Falls
6 City at the time.

August 16th, 1974, Mr. Schneider

7 reported that "This week,

I worked the Henderson,

8 Kentucky, market with our distributor, Mr.

Ron Utley.

I

9 am very pleased to report that the market for the first
10 seven months this year is up.
11

I realize that some of

this increase is due to the higher prices in the

12 Evansville market."

February 15,

13

'74, Mr. Schneider reported,

14 "Sales in the Henderson market are up the last months.
15 Some of this increase is due to the price increase in
16 the Evansville area."

August 23,

17

18 sales stated,

'74, reported in Vanco's — Vanco's

"Sales for the month of July are off over

19 9,000 cases from last year's sales.

Part of this

20 decrease is due to the lower prices in the Kentucky
21

22

markets."
It is replete that it was a unified market in

23 Falls City,

so admitted, and the important thing to look

24 at is not the decline of the sales of Falls City's
25 customers in central Indiana.

The important thing to

look at is the decline of the sales of Vanco relative to

2 the decline of the sales of Mr.

Otley of Dawson Springs,

3

the Henderson distributor, the favored distributor.

4

That is absolutely crucial, and the fact is and the

5

evidence is that from 1971 to 1977, the favored

6

purchasers, that is, Utley's sales, the distributor of

7 Henderson,

went down only 18 percent, while Vanco's went

8 down 63 percent.

to 1975, the favored purchasers'

10 sales actually increased

These are startling statistics

12 for distributors located less than ten miles apart.
13 •Actually they are five miles apart.

Vanco respectfully submits that this case was

14

15 given a full and fair trial, and the district court
16 found on its facts that Falls City had
17 Robinson-Patman Act,
18

violated the

that Vanco was injured in its

business and property as a result of Falls City’s

19 violation of the Robinson-Patman

Act, and that Falls

20 City was not meeting competition in good faith.

We ask the Court how a defendant can be

21

22 meeting competition when it reduced prices, when on six
23

separate occasions it raises its prices on the same day

24 in
25

Indiana and Kentucky, when it continuously increased

prices, when they never even attempted to comply with

the requirements of the statute, and its price increase

2 was the result of its filing in the higher prices of

3 competitors, and in fact leading off price increases.
4 How can you be meeting competition under those facts?
5

Lastly, I direct the attention of the Court to

6 the Stigler report, who is the author of the Chicago

7 School of Economics, so he certainly is a very
8 distinguished gentleman.

9

QUESTION*

He can't be all bad.

10

(General laughter.)

11

MR. CUSACK*

He is a great man, Your Honor.

12 The Stigler report was the report of the Task Force on

13 Productivity and Competition in 1969, which was
14 instituted by President Nixon, and it states, "Collusion
15 that can be incontrovertibly inferred from behavior,
16 such as persistent, substantial price discrimination in
17 the economists's sense, should not bring immunity from
18 the Sherman Act."
19

In this case, persistent and substantial price

20 discrimination and Falls City's continual increase of
21

prices and interest in maximizing its prices in Indiana

22 should not,

I respectfully submit, bring immunity to

23 violation of the Robinson-Patman Act.

6

It is clear from what we have heard that there

Thank, you. Your Honor.

7 is no doubt that that Falls City was following prices,
8 different prices that prevailed in Indiana and Kentucky,
9 as did everyone else.

There is no dispute from his

10 argument or from the record about that.
11

The thrust of

the argument is that there was something wrong with the

12 price in Indiana, that it was tainted, collusive,
13 parallel, a lot of adjectives, but there was no
14 adjudication that those prices were illegal.

There was

15 no adjudication that there was any illegal price
16 disrcimination between Henderson and Evansville.

Vanco

17 bought from Anheuser Busch.

It bought from others who

He may believe that to be

As in the second

3 Standard Oil Case, 400 355, 400 O.S. 355, where this
4 Court emphasized the fact that there had been no
5 adjudication of illegality, I think that is vital here.
We have got a small, dying brewer trying to

10 is trying, and the
11

record is abundantly clear, trying to

be competitive, trying to survive, trying to match

12 prices of its leading competitors in other markets.

13

There is no inconsistency at all with having a

14 unified market.

Remember, that only referred to

15 Henderson and Evansville.

The Indiana price was

16 determined by competitive conditions in Indiana as a
17 whole, and the law reguired that the Evansville price be
18 the same as charged throughout Indiana, and there is no
19 real mystery as to why the prices were higher in
20 Indiana.
21

It wasn't collusion or anything else.

It was

different competitive conditions, and if one looks at

22 the wholesale price evidence that there is in the

23 record, one will see that the wholesale prices of Vanco
24 were higher than the wholesale prices that the
25 distributor across the river was going to get, and that

was reflected in the brewery prices.

Indeed, there was a wholesale price increase

There was an FOB increase to Indiana, but not

There were different competitive

But in any event, whatever the explanation is,

11
12 and
13

I think that's it, there was no illegality in the

Indiana price or any illegality in the Kentucky price.

14 Falls City was following both,

and the fact that it

15 didn't reduce a price in order to meet competition
16 should be and is legally significant for all the reasons
17 that the government has said.
18

On the subject of the competitive injury, just
