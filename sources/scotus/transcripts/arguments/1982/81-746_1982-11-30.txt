ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN G. SEGEDY, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF CITY OF AKRON

9

HR. SEGEDYs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, the principal issues presented in this

11

case are whether the state may reasonably regulate in

12

the area of abortion in a manner designed to ensure an

13

informed decision by a pregnant woman in a situation

14

where there in fact is no physician-patient

15

relationship; likewise, whether the state may require

16

parental consent or judicial consent as a prerequisite

17

to an abortion to be performed upon an immature minor;

18

and finally, exactly what is the standard of review that

19

should be applied in the testing of abortion-related

20

legislation.

21

The Akron ordinance was passed on February 28,

22

1978, amongst considerable controversy, but contrary to

23

the characterization by the cross-petitioners that this

24

was a drastic departure from normal legislative

25

procedure, this ordinance and the process whereby it was
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

enacted is probably one of the finest examples of the

2

legislative process on the local level.

3

There were at least four public hearings on

4

this ordinance, including an entire day spent with

5

expert medical testimony with doctors from all over the

6

country, and likewise an entire day of legal testimony

7

with respect to legal experts rendering their opinions

8

as to the constitutionality of this ordinance.

9

I would point out to the Court that the

10

ordinance has not been challenged by a pregnant woman,

11

but has been challenged by three abortion clinics and a

12

doctor who resides approximately 300 miles from the City

13

of Akron.

14

This case represents a real lawsuit with real

15

parties and real evidence and a trial that lasted for

16

about two-and-a-half weeks, and I think when the Court

17

reviews the record, it will be eminently clear that in

18

the abortion situation in the City of Akron, there is no

19

physician-patient relationship anywhere near what this

20

Court envisioned in the case of Roe versus Wade.

21

When the Sixth Circuit tested this legislation

22

it applied a two-tier test> first, to determine whether

23

or not there was any legally significant impact or

24

consequence on the abortion decision, and if there was,

25

the court determined that there must be a compelling

state interest.

2

regulation impacted on the first trimester of pregnancy,

3

by its interpretation of Roe versus Wade, the state

4

necessarily did not have a compelling state interest.

5

The court then concluded that if the

QUESTION;

When you suggested that no patient

6

was challenging the statute, did you mean to suggest

7

that only a patient could challenge the statute?

8

MR. SEGEDY:

No, Your Honor.

I just point

that out in reference to the considerations with respect

10

to the parental consent provisions and with respect to

11

minors challenging the statute with respect to parental

12

consent.

13

tell us that there can be standing by jus tertii on the

14

part of the physician.

15

that.

16

Clearly Roe versus Wade and subsequent cases

The City of Akron recognizes

However, the city would submit that the proper

17

standard of review that should be applied, and the

18

standard which this Court has reiterated is whether or

19

not the regulation is unduly burdensome on the woman's

20

decision to have an abortion.

21

This Court stated in Roe versus Wade, and

22

reiterated numerous times that that decision did not

23

represent abortion on demand.

24

contained which the Court recognized in Roe versus Wade

25

was not simply the right to have an abortion, but the

The right that is

right to make that choice either to have an abortion or

2

to bear a child.

3

choice.

The essential right is that freedom of

The abortion clinics in this case, as the

4
5

record shows, make certain assumptions with respect to

6

this situation, the first of which is that abortion is

7

always the best choice for the pregnant woman; secondly,

8

that the abortion clinics* interests always align in

9

essentially a one-to-one correspondence with the

10

pregnant woman or the minor; and finally, that the

11

interests of the state or the City of Akron in this case

12

or the parents are somehow adverse to that of the

13

pregnant woman or the pregnant minor.
This Court has recognized interest in maternal

14
15

health, potential life, and maintaining medical

16

standards.

17

another important interest involved in this area which

18

this Court has not had to face yet, because it has not

19

come up in any particular fact situation, and that is,

20

the city or the state has an interest in protecting the

21

woman's own constitutional right of her freedom of

22

choice as to whether or not to have an abortion or

23

whether to carry her child, her unborn child to term.

24
25

The City of Akron would submit there is also

The city would submit this is an important
interest, in fact compelling, and exists throughout the

10

I think the courts below must look at a

That impact may be

If in fact the impact is burdensome, the city

11

would submit that there must be a determination of

12

whether or not there is a substantial burden on the

13

woman’s right to choose.

14

burden, as in Roe versus Wade or Planned Parenthood

15

versus Danforth with respect to the parental veto, then

16

there must be a compelling state interest.

17

If there is a substantial

On the contrary, if the burden is only

18

insubstantial, all the state need show is that there is

19

a rational basis for the legislation.

argument in the court of appeals.

QUESTION:

However,

Hell, now, the intervenors didn't

bring — didn't come here.
HR. SEGEDY:

Your Honor, the intervenors

19

petitioned this Court also on that question, and we can

20

only speculate whether this Court denied that petition

21

because it was a duplication of the city’s petition, and

22

therefore, not being aware of any possible standing

23

arguments, simply determined that —

There might be two, or there might

The questions presented —

be seven or eight under that one judgment.

11

MR. SEGEDY;

12

I would point out to the Court, if the Court

13

has concern about that, under the O'Bannon case, which

14

deals with this question with respect to the raising of

15

a question and the waiver, that the respondents in this

16

case. Dr. Seguin and Mrs. Black, may raise those

17

questions under Rule 21.4, I believe it is, and that is

18

exactly the situation we have here, as in the O’Bannon

19

case, where the dispute was between HEW and the

20

Department of Welfare.

21

Correct, Your Honor.

The City of Akron submits that the major

22

thrust of this legislation is not burdensome on the

23

choice of the pregnant woman, but is rather

24

choice-enhancing.

25

under the facts of this case, and it is very important

And the city would also submit that

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that the record be viewed very -- very carefully, that

2

as the physician relationship, physician-patient

3

relationship diminishes, the state's interest in

4

protecting that relationship increases.

5

And what this record shows is that there is no

6

physician-patient relationship.

7

that would be that the woman signs her informed consent

8

form prior to the time that she ever sees a physician,

9

and that is undisputed and clear in the record.

10

A primary example of

The Sixth Circuit struck down the informed

11

consent provision on the basis of it impacting upon the

12

first trimester of pregnancy.

13

upheld informed consent in Planned Parenthood versus

14

Danforth — excuse me, in Planned Parenthood versus

15

Danforth, in principle, by a general informed consent,

16

and likewise in Franklin versus Fitzpatrick, by summary

17

affirmance, and by implication in H.L. versus Matheson

18

by way of a footnote approving a detailed informed

19

consent provision.

20

However, this Court has

Again, the city would submit that there is

21

this compelling interest of the state in the choice of

22

the woman, that is, her fundamental constitutional

23

right, and the city may protect that choice by ensuring

24

that there is a physician-patient relationship, as the

25

Court envisioned in Eoe versus Wade.
11

1

This provision creates no harden on the

2

woman’s decision, and it provides flexibility for the

3

physician.

1870.06(c), it is provided that the physician shall

5

provide such other information as he deems is relevant

6

to the woman’s decision.

We would point out to the Court in

t

7

It is charged that the provision is one-sided.

8

that is, the information goes toward possibly what might

9

lead her not to decide to have an abortion, but the

10

purpose for that is looking at what is the danger of

11

risk of non-information, which way does that risk go,

12

toward the physician underinforming toward abortion or

13

toward going to term?
In 1870.05(b), the Court struck down the

14

parental consent provision.

As we pointed out to the

16

Court already, there was no woman or no minor at all who

17

challenged this provision, only the abortion clinics and

first of all, that the juvenile court could disregard

that provision as applied to a pregnant minor seeking an

But under Bellotti 2 and Natheson,

certainly the view that at least four Justices

Is it part of your position that

2

Danforth, the Danforth holding on parental consent does

3

not apply to people under 15?
MR. SEGEDY:

4

Your Honor, in Planned Parenthood

5

versus Danforth, this Court noted that not all minors,

6

regardless of age or maturity, are capable of consenting

7

to an abortion, and I think that it is possible for the

8

state to make a determination at some point that

9

parental consent may be required.
QUESTION;

10

11

Are you arguing in this case that

Danforth does not apply in the ages below 15?

12

MR. SEGEDYs

13

14

MR. SEGEDY;

No, Your Honor.
You are not.
As a practical matter, we are

almost always dealing with immature minors, minors of

be 14 who have the maturity of a 35-year-old, and

18

likewise 35-year-olds who have the maturity of a

20

line somewhere, just as it does for virtually every

21

other purpose, such as voting, which is a very

22

fundamental right, as to maturity.

13, 12.

Now, there are certainly minors who might

If a person would submit that he is mature

enough to vote at age 17, I don’t think that person

would get too far with the constitutional argument.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.,

9

ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF AKRON

10

MR. LEEs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

11

the Court, I would like to address the issue of the

12

standard of review.

13

before the Court is that they are simply the next in a

14

series of cases in which over the past decade the Court

15

has developed a rather detailed body of federal

16

constitutional rules dealing with abortion.

One way to view the cases now

17

Under that view, the Court's task today is to

18

consider about a dozen separate provisions of state and

19

local law and declare each of them either constitutional

20

or unconstitutional.

21

outline of applicable federal constitutional rules is

2

two steps.

3

Segedy has said, a decade of this Court's abortion

4

decisions have now established that not every abortion

5

regulation is governed by the compelling state interest

6

test, but only those that unduly burden the woman's

7

decision whether to have an abortion or not.

It involves

The first is a recognition that as Hr.

The second step would be to declare that in
making that key determination, ultimately a judicial

10

determination, concerning which practices do and which

11

do not unduly burden the abortion decision, the Court

12

should be mindful of four things.

13

The first is that most of the questions

14

dealing with the undue burden issue have substantial

15

factual components.

16

the 24-hour delay requirement lead, or does it not, to a

17

better informed decision?

find you could go

20

By the time that a lawsuit brings the total

21

issues into court, the competing arguments concerning

22

these factual components have already been addressed and

23

resolved by a legislature which, for reasons discussed

24

in our brief, is better qualified as an institution to

25

deal with factual issues than is a court.
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

And to the extent that the issues are

2

non-factual — this is my second point — they involve a

3

blend of constitutional law and also policy.

4

resolution of these two kinds of issues, constitutional

5

law on the one hand and public policy on the other, are

the core functions of courts on the one hand and

legislatures on the other.

legal decision-making, or is there some room for

accommodating the two, for recognizing that what is

of both branches?

We believe that there is, and that the

First, at the end of the day, the ultimate

decision must be made by the courts, but in exercising

this ultimate and awesome power, the courts must be

mindful that the kinds of competing considerations that

account by a representative legislative body exercising

involves balancing.

with observations, such as that in Maher, that, and I am

quoting, "8oe v. Hade can be understood only by

5

considering both the woman’s interest and the nature of

6

the state’s interference with it."

This Court’s decisions are replete

One of the similarities between courts and

8

legislatures is that both from time to time engage in

9

the balancing process.

One of the differences is that

10

legislatures do it better.

12

choosing between competing values, and the optimum

balance almost always depends on issues of fact.

separation of powers are best served by judicial

19

recognition of the fact that the same balancing process

20

or almost the same has already been undertaken by an

21

institution of government which is better qualified to

22

perform the function and within whose institutional

MR. LEE:

MR. LEE:

I am not, Mr. Justice Blackmun.
Why not?
That is not one of the issues

13

presented in this case, and as amicus appearing before

14

the Court, that would not be a proper function for us.

15

QUESTION:

It seems to me that your brief in

16

essence asks either that or the overruling of Marbury

17

against Madison.

18

MR. LEE:

Neither.

Neither.

And the reason

19

is, as I have just stated, the ultimate decision at the

20

end of the day concerning these matters is a judicial

21

decision, but all I am pleading for is a recognition

22

that both with respect to issues of fact which

23

necessarily pervade each of these decisions that is

24

made, and also with respect to their factual

25

non-components, that the Court at least take into

since that time.

1

We simply submit that after a decade of this

2

Court's decisions which have raised the question that is

3

before the Court as to whether it is compelling state

4

interest that applies across the boards or whether we

5

have now reached the point that it is only the undue

6

burden, that rather than having these cases come back

7

year after year after year, with the list of applicable

8

federal constitutional rules becoming longer and longer

9

and longer, that the time has now come to apply those

10

principles that the Court has so well developed in other

11

areas dealing with substantive due process to this area

12

of the law which also rests on substantive due process,

13

and at least to take into account the fact that another

14

governmental decision or another governmental body also

15

charged with the responsibility of facing these same

16

kinds of questions has faced them, and that they have

17

resolved them.

18

A final consideration is that to whatever

19

extent a public policy issue is constitutionalized, all

20

but one of the competing points of view are eliminated

21

as acceptable alternatives.

22

a free society is that the search for truth is enhanced

23

by permitting full and uninhibited discussion of public

24

issues by leaving those issues exposed for a time to the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHAN LANDSMAN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF AKRON CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
MR. LANDSMAN;

16

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, the Akron ordinance before the Court

18

today requires that when any woman seeks an abortion in

19

the City of Akron, she and her physician must comply

20

I would like to begin my argument with a

6

discussion of the constitutional standard applicable in

7

this case, and then turn to the various sections of the

8

ordinance, beginning with the informed consent script

9

and the 24-hour delay, the ban on clinical second

10

11

trimester procedures, and the minor's veto.
In Roe versus Wade, this Court held that a

12

woman had a fundamental right, in consultation with her

13

physician, to choose whether to terminate a pregnancy.

14

As this Court indicated in Roe and reiterated as

15

recently as Harris versus McRae, regulations restricting

16

this fundamental right are presumptively

17

unconstitutional.

18

In order to sustain abortion regulations, the

19

state has a heavy burden.

Either it must show that

20

those regulations do not restrict the woman's decision,

21

as this Court identified in the Danforth case, or if the

22

plaintiffs demonstrate that a regulation imposes a

23

cognizable burden, then the regulation be supported by a

24

compelling state interest and be narrowly drawn to

25

support only that interest.

to rob the woman of an independent decision-making

Rather,

The next section of the ordinance that I would

10

like to analyze is Section 1870.07.

It mandates that

11

every woman make two separate trips to the abortion

12

clinic by imposing a delay of no less than 24 hours

3

between the signing of the informed consent form and the

4

performance of the abortion procedure.
This section was held unconstitutional by the

5

court of appeals.

7

defendants do not deny, that the two-visit delay

requirement was designed to force every woman to go

through a cooling off period after signing an informed

consent form.

MR. LANDSMAN:

1

No, Your Honor.

I don't

2

believe that such a requirement would have been

3

constitutional.

4

The purpose of this cooling off period was, as

5

the defendants have said in their brief, to have each

6

woman mull over the scripted information provided by

7

Akron, in other words, to reconsider in light of the

8

misleading and inflammatory materials Akron presents her

9

decision.

In essence, this was an effort to dissuade

10

her from the choice she had made and indicated in her

11

signed consent.
This requirement treats women as if they are

12
13

not to be trusted to know their own minds or to make

14

rational decisions, despite the fact that over half of

15

the women who come to the Akron clinic have borne

16

children previously, and over three-quarters have been

17

professionally counseled either by a physician or

18

another health care professional, before they ever

19

arrive at an Akron clinic.

Mr. Landsman, supposing we were to

on those who have employment by forcing them to miss

extra child care expenses and so forth.

12

And, of course, underlying all this is the

13

feeling of the woman that she wants to have privacy in

14

this choice.

15

is easy to rearrange your schedule to do so, but when

16

you have to go back again a second time, it becomes an

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

we are saying is that every regulation enacted by a

state that clearly burdens the woman's choice, as this

does with respect to cost, with respect to risks, and so

1

the essence in the abortion decision, as this Court

2

noted in Doe versus Bolton, and defendant's abject

3

failure of proof, this section is unconstitutional.

4

Seven courts of appeals and eleven district courts have

5

reached precisely the same conclusion, and struck down

6

waiting periods of varying lengths.
Further, the blanket delay requirement is not

7

8

narrowly drawn.

As concurring Judge Kennedy in the

9

court of appeals indicated, you can never get out of the

10

24-hour delay requirement where it is medically

11

contraindicated, or where previous counseling has been

12

had, as it has in three-quarters of the cases in Akron,

13

or where the cost increases are overwhelming.
The next section of the ordinance I would like

14
15

to address is Section 1870.03, which bans second

16

trimester abortions in clinics and requires their

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN G. SEGEDY, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF CITY OF AKRON - REBUTTAL

5

MR. SEGEDY:

Very well.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

6

please the Court, I would like to briefly discuss with

7

the Court some of the points that are shown in the

8

record with respect to the operation of the abortion

9

clinics in Akron.

10

First of all, the abortion clinics are

11

commercial enterprises that are owned by laymen,

12

operated for profit.

13

which they advertise the finest medical care, the best

14

medical care, safe and legal.

15

They run ads in the newspaper in

experience as a respiratory therapist.

22

She is counseled by

One counselor, for example, had some

The counseling is done in group sessions 85

23

percent of the time, and the record shows also that the

24

counseling is done with minors mixed in groups with

25

adults in this group counseling session.

One of the

51

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

clinic counselors, as is shown in the Joint Appendix at

2

Page 247 through 258, testified that all of the

3

information contained in 1870.06(b) is not only

4

irrelevant but harassing.

5

The record shows that the patients are often

6

given tranquilizers on standing physician orders before

7

they ever sign the informed consent forms, before they

8

ever see the physician.

9

testifying under a pseudonym, testified that he in fact

Doctor C, one of the doctors

10

treats his patients, his private patients, differently

11

than he treats the patients in the abortion clinics.

12

Dr. B testified that he never attempts to judge the

13

maturity of a minor.

14
15
16

QUESTIONi

Why do these doctors testify under

a pseudonym?
MR. SEGEDY i

Your Honor, I believe it was

17

because they were afraid of harassment or such.

18

believe they filed affidavits to that effect in order to

19

have that status.

20

I

What the record clearly shows inevitably is

21

that in every case the woman signs the informed consent

22

form prior to the time that she sees her physician, and

23

she spends about five to ten minutes with the physician,

24

including the surgical procedure.

25

The physician essentially at most, according
52

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

questions.
