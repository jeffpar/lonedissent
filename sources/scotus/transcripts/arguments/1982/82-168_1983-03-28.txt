CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WALLACE:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, for the third time this term I am here

11

to discuss burdens of persuasion and burdens of

12

production, this time in the context of the National

13

Labor Relations Board's allocation of burdens of proof

14

in a proceeding under Section 8(a)(3) of the Act

15

charging a discharge of an employee for anti-union

16

animus.

"1

r

17

If the Court please, I would like to proceed

18

with my argument first by describing briefly but

19

comprehensively the overall allocation of burdens of

20

proof in such a proceeding which we believe to be

21

correct and which we believe to be a fair distillation

22

of the Board's decisions and practice.

23

I do this because we believe that much of the

24

confusion in this area stems from incomplete analysis

25

and from an effort to force all categories of cases into

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

an analytical framework that suits only some categories

2

of cases.

3

And after that, I would like to focus on the

4

aspect of the allocation that is at issue here, and show

5

that as to this, the Board faithfully follows the

6

Congressional intent, and that its practice is

7

consistent with principles reflected in this Court’s

8

decisions, and then show that these principles were

8

properly applied to the facts of this case.
QUESTION:

11

even if not welcomed.

20

ME. WALLACE:

To begin with in such a

21

proceeding the general counsel, of course, has a burden

22

of production and a burden of persuasion to show that —

23

we'll talk about discharges here, although this applies

24

to any 8(a)(3) case and to many 8(a)(1) cases involving

25

other adverse action, but to show that the discharge was

u

1

improperly motivated, that anti-union animus generally

2

was a motivating factor in the meaning of this Court's

3

decision.
If he establishes that with his evidence, and

4
5

that evidence is uncontroverted, of course, he has

6

established his case.

7

evidence establishes that, there is a burden of

8

production on the employer to controvert it in some way,

9

and the usual manner of controverting it is to show that

So in that sense, if he — if his

10

there was a legitimate reason or reasons for the

11

discharge.

12

well by the employer.

13

There may be other evidence introduced as

That evidence usually serves two purposes, the

14

evidence of a legitimate reason.

15

evidence that there was an improper motivation, or two,

16

to show that the discharge would have occurred in any

17

event even in the absence of the improper motivation.

18

Occasionally, that evidence is introduced for only the

19

latter purpose.

20

some, in which the employer admits that an improper

21

purpose was a motivating factor, but nonetheless defends

22

on the ground that the same result would have been

23

reached in any event.

24
25

One, to rebut the

There are cases, and we have cited

Now, if what the employer introduces is
inherently incredible, or insubstantial on its face,

1

that doesn't really change the case. and in that sense

2

his burden of production has not been satisfied.

3

he has introduced something plausible, as was the case

4

here, he has satisfied that burden of production, and

5

then the burden of persuasion remains on the general

6

counsel to do at least one of two things.

7

But if

One, he might try to persuade the tribunal

8

that the proferrei legitimate reasons, and I use

10

value judgment, that the proferred legitimate reasons

11

were not in fact a motivating factor at all.

12

carries that burden of persuasion, that is a true

13

pretext case, and he has shown that only the improper

14

motivation was present, and the case remains what it was

15

before that evidence was introduced.

16

If he

But if he is unable to do that, then the

17

question is whether in light of the evidence introduced

18

by the employer, the general counsel can still satisfy

19

the burden of persuasion which is on him by a

20

preponderance of the evidence that the improper reason

21

was also a motivating factor.

22

If in light of all the evidence, including the

23

evidence introduced by the employer, the general counsel

24

still succeeds by a preponderance of the evidence in

25

showing that anti-union animus was a motivating factor,

It is not — it is not segmented

We are segmenting it only for analytical

QUESTIONS

Why does it help the Board, if I

might ask, to have these various presumptions and

10

burdens of persuasion?

11

them to hear from one side and then hear from the other

12

and then decide the factual question?

13

QUESTION s

Wouldn't it be just as easy for

Well, that is what they -- what

14

they really do, but I am trying to specify the analysis

15

used in allocating who had the burden of persuasion on

16

what in issuing their decisions, in analyzing the

17

evidence that has been introduced.

18

QUESTION*

Well, I can see how that would be

19

useful if the Board directed a verdict against someone

20

saying that, you know, we are going to stop the

21

proceeding right here because even believing your

22

evidence, it’s not enough to even warrant a fact

23

finding, but in proceedings that have gone to

24

completion, and the Board has heard all the evidence,

25

how does this rather structured and somewhat artificial

2

form of analysis move the ball?
MR. WALLACE*

Well, it's arguable that the

3

ball would move with greater ease without it, but this

4

is what the Board has been doing to explain its

5

decisions, and it is the context against which Congress

6

legislated in Taft-Hartley in revising the law.

7

think what they did on this subject in Taft-Hartley can

8

be understood without recognition that it was done

9

against this background, and it is the background

I don't

10

against which the Courts of Appeals have divided in

11

their views.

12

I think to understand what has occurred in

13

this field,

14

analyzing these cases, even if it might have been

15

possible to proceed differently.

16

we have to recognize how the Board has been

And I am almost at the end of this overview.

17

I was saying, if the general counsel was unable to show

18

that it was a pretext, the clearest way of doing that

19

would be to show that the reason didn't exist at all

20

factually, or as was the case with one of the reasons

21

here, that the employer didn’t know about it until after

22

the discharge decision was made.

23

Or there can be other ways of showing it was a

24

pretext, such as by showing that this was commonly done

25

with impunity by other employees to the knowledge of the

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

employer.

In any event, if he doesn't succeed in

2

showing that it was a pretext, but nonetheless carries

3

his burden of persuasion, showing by a preponderance of

4

the evidence that anti-union animus was also a

5

motivating factor, then we have a true dual motive case,

6

and we have a case in which the general counsel has

7

satisfied his burden of persuasion that a violation of

8

Section 8(a)(3) occurred by showing that the adverse

9

action, the discharge took place for a prohibited

10

reason, because from the beginning, if the discharge

11

took place in whole or in part for a prohibitive — for

12

a prohibited reason, that was sufficient to show a

13

violation.
Part of the confusion steins, however, from the

14
15

fact that the Board still refers to this showing as a

16

prima facie case, and the reason it dees that is because

17

it recognizes the possibility of the employer still

18

establishing an affirmative defense, by showing with

19

respect to a hypothetical question that the discharge

20

would have occurred for the legitimate reasons even in

21

the absence of the improper motivation for the

22

discharge.

23

And on that question, the Board has

24

consistently placed the burden of persuasion as well as

25

of production on the employer, and the Board has

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

referred to this as an affirmative defense, and the

2

issue in this case, the difference between the Board and

3

the court of appeals in this case focuses solely on this

4

phase of the analysis.
Now, whether it is proper for the Board to

5

6

place the burden of persuasion on this question on the

7

employer, or whether the burden of persuasion must

8

remain with the general counsel on this question, and

9

this is a matter that was addressed with great

10

specificity in the legislative history of Taft-Hartley,

11

and unlike some cases in which the Board appears before

12

the Court, where we are contending that the Board’s

13

interpretation of the Act on a specific matter is a

14

reasonable interpretation among reasonable alternatives,

15

and therefore should be sustained, this, it seems to us,

16

is an interpretation required by the legislative history

17

of the revision of the Act in Taft-Hartley.
And I would like to turn to the pertinent

18
19

materials.

It was well established, as we have shown in

20

cases collected starting at Page 15 of our brief, prior

21

to Taft-Hartley, that if the discharge was motivated in

22

whole or in part by the improper motivation , a violation

23

had been shown, and that the burden was on the employer

24

to prove as a defense that he would have reached the

25

same result in the absence of the improper motivation.

1

Many .Board opinions, and we have quoted one on

2

Page 16, referred to language used in a well known

3

Second Circuit opinion, NLRB against Remington Rand,

4

which is cited at the bottom of Page 16 of our brief, in

5

which Learned Hand rejected the defense factually,

6

although ha said it was a proper defense for the

7

employer to make, in language that was quoted and

8

requoted many times, that it rested upon the tort

9

feasor, as he called the employer, because the general

10

counsel had shown that he had acted out of improper

11

motivation.

13

from those for which it was immune.

14

It rested upon the tort feasor to

And that interpretation was made clear in

15

annual reports to Congress which we have cited in

16

Footnote 9 on Page 18, and was criticized in the House

17

hearings quite specifically.

19

advocated, and indeed the House bill would have changed

20

the law specifically in that respect, and on Page 18 of

21

our brief we have described the provision that was in

22

the House bill to change the law on that question.

We have referred to that

And a change in the law was

23

That provision was not in the Senate bill, and

24

the conference committee struck it in favor of retaining

25

the existing practice before the Board.

This was one of

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

many examples, as we have reminded the Court from time

2

to time, in which the strategy of th e conference was

3

against making particular changes be cause they had in

4

mind larger objectives to be achieve d in Taft-Hartley.

12

veto, and other matters were not bei ng changed because

13

of their desire to accomplish these major objectives,

14

And Senator Taft, in an ex tended interchange

15

on the floor in reporting the confer ence bill, and we

16

have quoted pertinent portions of it on Page 20 of our

17

brief, an extended interchange with Senator Pepper, who

18

was raising this problem that the Ho use had tried to

19

shift the burden of proof away from the employer on this

20

issue, kept pointing out repeatedly that this was struck

21

by the conference committee from the House bill, and as

22

we say at the conclusion of the exce rpt we have here,

23

under provision of the conference re port, the employer

24

has to make the proof.

25

This is the present rule a nd the present

practice of the Board.

QUESTION;

3

call it its Wright-Line test?

test?

MR. WALLACE;

QUESTION;

MR. WALLACE;

8

QUESTION;

9

Is it the Wright-Line

It is the Wright-Line test now,

But that is a 1980 —
That is correct.

And when was the earliest — what

was the earliest Board’s case that articulated that?
MR. WALLACE;

10

Well, the first one that we cite

11

is Dow Chemical in 1939, and the one that we have quoted

12

on Page 16 is also a 1939 case, and —
QUESTION;

13
14

And was it changed at all in

Wright-Line ?
MR. WALLACE;

15

We don't think Wright-Line meant

16

to change the standard at all, but it meant to

17

articulate it with the help of this Court's opinion in

18

Mt. Healthy.
QUESTION;

19

Well, it didn't need any help if it

20

was so clear from the statutory language and history,

21

did it?

22

MR. WALLACE;

Well, it wasn't always

23

articulated well by the Board, and the reason for this

24

is that until Wright-Line, in the cases in which the

25

Board was ruling for the general counsel and holding

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that the employer did not sustain its burden of proving

2

that the discharge or other adverse action would have

3

occurred anyway/ the Eoard tended to articulate the dual

4

motive aspect of the case.

5

But when the Board was ruling for the employer

6

in these cases, it tended not to articulate that it was

7

a dual motive case.

8

general counsel did not sustain his burden, often saying

9

that he didn't make out his prima facie case, which

It tended just to say that the

10

caused even more confusion.

11

those cases whether the Board really thought it was a

2

It was hard to tell in

dual motive case at all.
We have collected in our brief, in the

3
4

footnote on Page 37, Footnote 25, numerous cases in

5

which the Board has sustained the employer and said that

6

he has met his burden of proving that the adverse action

7

would have taken place anyway, but they are all cases

8

from 1981 and 1982, because it was only after

9

Wright-Line specified that the Mt. Healthy analysis

20

should be used that the Board began explicitly in ruling

2

for the employer to recognize which cases were dual

22

motivate cases where the employer had carried that

23

burden.

24

I think Wright-Line was an effort to

25

articulate the standard more clearly, and to bring about

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

better consistency of practice from case to case before

2

the Board.

Board's rule or practice.

It wasn't meant to be a change in the

QUESTIONi

Nr. Wallace, how far from the

5

position taken by the AFL-CIO in its brief is the

6

Board's position?

7

HR. WALLACES

It is very similar, but the

8

Board has chosen not to issue a remedy at all in cases

9

in which the employer has sustained the burden.

The

10

Board would do what the AFL-CIO is advocating, issue a

11

cease and desist order in a hypothetical case, in a

12

fairly narrow category of cases.

13

For example, in our own case, it was shown

14

that one of the reasons given by the employer, that he

15

had left his keys in the bus, was something that the

16

employer did not know until after the discharge had

17

taken place.

18

had been — it turned out that in this case that was

19

something commonly done, it was found.

20

have justified the discharge anyway.

21

been a more substantial infraction, something that would

22

have justified a discharge, that he had his hand in the

23

till or something of that sort, and yet the discharge

24

took place because of anti-union animus before the

25

employer knew of that, the Board would find a violation,

It was a pretext in that sense.

If that

It would not
But if that had

15

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

and issue presumably a cease and desist order, but would

2

not order reinstatement in a situation like that,

3

because an affirmative defense in the sense of some thing

4

to mitigate the remedy had been shown.

5

But they treat the legitimate reason for the

6

discharge at the time the discharge took place as a n

7

affirmative defense that negates a violation.

8

probably could have gone either way on this questio n

9

consistently with the legislative history, but that has

10
11

12
13
14

been their practice.

MR. WALLACEi
of what.
QUESTION;

3
4

Well, it depends on the evidence

Evidence on the issue of whether or

not actual anti-union animus was a motivating factor.
MR. WALLACE;

5

On that, the general counsel has

6

the burden of proof, and he must satisfy the Board by a

7

preponderance of the evidence.

8

QUESTION;

9

Well, then, does the general

counsel differ from Judge Briar's view of the case?
MR. WALLACE;

10

Well, I have to regard Judge

11

Briar's opinion as an example of trying to fit all

12

categories of cases into a framework that is suitable

13

only for some categories, and not recognizing that there

14

is this other category of cases where the general

15

counsel has persuaded the Board that there was a true

16

dual motivation, and the question is then who has the

17

burden of proof of persuasion on the question of whether

18

hypothetically the discharge would have occurred anyway.
QUESTION;

19

Well, but in the category, not the

20

Mt. Healthy affirmative defense category, but the other,

21

there is no difference, as I understand you, between

22

Judge Briar and the general counsel.
MR. WALLACE;

23
24
25

That is correct.

That is

correct.
QUESTION;

Well, is it that the general

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST, N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

counsel must prove a discriminatory motive or anti-union

2

bias?

How much of one does he have to prove?
MR. WALLACE;

3
4

He has to prove that it was a

motivating factor.

5

QUESTION;

A motivating factor.

6

MR. WALLACE;

A motivating factor, as this

7

Court used that term in Arlington Heights and in Mt.

8

Healthy.
QUESTION;

9

Would it be enough if the evidence

10

showed that the employer was generally hostile to having

11

a union organized?
MR. WALLACE;

12

By and large, that would not be

13

enough.

We have again collected a number of cases in

14

another footnote in our brief, Footnote 19 on Page 31,

15

to show that speculation or suspicion of this kind has

16

QUESTION*

Mr. Wallace, I thought there had

7

been some suggestion in the cases, anyway, that what the

general counsel has to prove is that the employee would

not have been fired but for the union activity.

10

MR. WALLACE;

There is the way that some of

11

the Courts of Appeals have expressed a disagreement with

12

the Eoard on who has the burden of persuasion as to the

13

affirmative defense.

14

persuasion being on the general counsel to negate the

15

affirmative defense by showing that but for the improper

16

motivation, the discharge would not have taken place,

I have not yet gotten to, and I want to point out to the

2

Court, and that is something quoted on Page 20 from

3

Senator Ball, right beneath the quotation that we have

4

of Senator Taft.

5

is the context in which Senator Ball's remarks were

6

made.

7

What we didn't make clear in the brief

Senator Taft's remarks were made in reporting

8

what the conference did prior to the vote on the

9

conference report.

Senator Ball made his remarks in the

10

debate on whether to override President Truman's veto,

11

and he was on the team of proponents, and Senator Taft

12

yield 20 minutes of debate time for the proponents to

13

Senator Ball for the purpose of rebutting certain

14

specific items in President Truman's veto message.

15

And the fifth of those items was, as the

16

President said, "The bill would make it easier for an

17

employer to get rid of employees whom he wanted to

18

discharge because they exercised their right of

19

self-organization guaranteed by the Act," and Senator

20

Ball said, "Mr. President, what that refers to is an

21

explicit provision inserted in the bill in conference

22

saying that if the employer proves to the satisfaction

23

of the Board that he discharged an employee for cause,

24

he cannot be held guilty of an unfair labor practice in

25

discharging him.”

20

I will determine — I will discuss with you

this morning that the First Circuit Court of Appeals

6

correctly concluded that the Eoard exceeded its

statutory authority when it required this respondent to

overcome rather than to neutralize the general counsel's

I will show this by indicating that

10

the Board misapplied the role of a prima facie case,

11

failed to adhere to the statutory mandate of Sections

can seek relief, and that is the way

6

structured, and you read it in conjunction with the

7

rules of evidence, which are clearly articulated in

8

10(b), which we see in Rule 301 of the federal rules,

9

and made applicable to the Board, I think we must look

10

at the language of the statute and say that it is very

11

clear on its face, and that what Congress was concerned

12

with was the ultimate burden of proof, and not concerned

13

with the shifting burden, the shifting burden that rises

in the presumption of the original prima facie showing,

And yet when you look at the history of the

Board’s Wright-Line, it bases its understanding of an

employment discrimination test on Kt. Healthy.

cannot have an employer with an affirmative defense and

also suggest that your employment discrimination test is

also consistent with this conceptual approach of a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,

Justice Stevens asked me at the end, that the findings

'24

of the Administrative Law Judge would certainly be more

25

than adequate to dispose of this case properly, and we

1

quote in our reply brief on Page 6, in the first

2

footnote paragraph on that page, we quote those

3

pertinent -- the crucial findings, that a preponderance

4

of the evidence establishes that the decision to

5

discharge him was motivated by a desire to discourage

6

union activities, and respondent would not have fired

7

him but for his union activities.
Now, the Board adopted those findings, but

8
9

said, as clarified herein, and what the Board apparently

10

was concerned about was that the Administrative Law

11

Judge wrote shortly before the Board's Wright-Line

2

decision, and the Board was attempting to clarify it by

3

putting it in terms of the Wright-Line decision, and

4

they may well have been worried that the Administrative

5

Law Judge's formulation of the but for his union

6

activities might have meant that the general counsel had

had the burden of persuasion on that issue.

to Justice Stevens*

6

which the employer discovered the day after that the

7

employee was a thief?

8

Mr. Wallace, how would you respond
question as to the situation in

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I think that would be an

9

affirmative defense that would go to remedy, and would

10

show that reinstatement would not be appropriate, even

11

though a violation had occurred, because at the time of

12

the discharge it was solely for improper purpose.

13

QUESTION:

What about back pay?

14

MR. WALLACEi

Back pay, I am not positive what

15

the Board would do, but they certainly would not award

16

back pay for more than the one day.

17

QUESTION:

One day.

18

QUESTION:

Will you tell me, then, if that is

19

the case, what is the nature of the Mt. Healthy

20

affirmative defense?

21

MR. WALLACE:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. WALLACE:

Well, it was --

In the Board — in this context.
It is to prove the hypothetical

24

that the discharge would have occurred even in the

25

absence of the improper motivation,

just as it was in

QUESTIONS

And does it apply when there is

3

proof that the Hoard accepts that there was in fact an

4

actual anti-union animus?
MR. WALLACES

5
6

applies.

8

That is a dual motive case.
QUESTIONS

7

case?

Yes, that is -- that is where it

Why is that different from my thief

I don't understand.

9

MR. WALLACES

Well, in the thief case, the

10

discharge took place before they knew that he was a

11

thief, so there wasn't a dual motive for the discharge,

12

but there now would be a legitimate reason in retrospect

13

for the discharge.

14

QUESTION:

I see, but you would say the

15

difference is, if you knew he was a thief at the time

16

you discharged him, but the thievery was only one of the

17

reasons.

18

MR. WALLACE:

Yes, but if you could show that

19

it would have been a sufficient reason in itself, and

20

would have produced the same result.

21

QUESTION:

Let me clarify something at least

22

for my own reactions.

The employer discharges for union

23

activity, and after he has given the notice of discharge

24

and carried it out, when they audit the man's books,

25

they find that he has embezzled $25,000.

Now, what do

they do?

2

wrong reason, and then fire him for the right reason?

3

Reinstate him for having b een fired for the

MR. WALLACE:

I doubt that the Board would

4

reinstate him at all in that situati on, but they would

5

probably issue a cease and desist or der telling the

6

employer to cease and desist for tak ing adverse action

7

against employees because of their u nion activities, as

8

they did in this case.

9

that.

10

QUESTION:

It was prove n that they did

Eut — I take i t the Board's

11

Wright-Line test in this very case w ould not -- it would

12

not result in a conclusion by the Bo ard that there had

13

been an unfair labor practice if the employer carries

14

his burden.

15

MR. WALLACE;

16

QUESTION:

That is corr ect.

And you wouldn' t — so that he

17

couldn’t be posted or there couldn't be a cease or

18

19

could be a cease and desist order —

22

SR. WALLACE;

QUESTION;

24

MR. WALLACE:

25

That is the Board's --

Yes, Your Honor.

-- and there could be posting.
Then that is — well, there is a

practice under Title 7 that an injunction would issue

legitimate reasons.

indicated that there wouldn't be a violation.

On the other hand, in the final
