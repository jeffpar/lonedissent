ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBORAH BACHRACH, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

6
7

MS. BACHRACH:
Court:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

This case presents two distinct issues.

First, whether

ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,

10

preempts the New York State Human Rights Law to the extent that

11

law prohibits discrimination in employee benefit plans.

12

13

The second issue is whether ERISA preempts the New
York State Disability Benefits Law.

14

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found

15

both laws preempted, a result never intended by Congress and at

16

odds with the language of ERISA.
Turning first to the Human Rights Law, the dispositive

17
18

language is in Section 514 (d) of ERISA.

19

MS. BACHRACH:

21

QUESTION:

22

MS. BACHRACH:

Section 514(a) —

Where is that set forth in the brief?
Pages four and five of the blue brief.

Thank you.
ERISA, Section 514(a), provides that

23

ERISA supersedes state laws which relate to employee benefit

24

plans.

25

trued

Section 514(d) directs that that language shall not be conso as to alter, amend, modify, invalidate, impair, or

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

4

1

supersede any law of the United States.

2
3

To preempt the New York State Human Rights Law would
impair Title VII.

4

A review of the legislative history and the statutes

5

makes clear the inter-relationship between the state fair

6

employment laws and the federal fair employment law and shows

7

that to preempt the New York Human Rights Law would, indeed,

8

impair that statutory scheme.

9

Title VII was enacted in 1964.

At that time, more

10

than half the states had fair employment legislation.

11

examined the statutes in the states and designed the federal

12

scheme to supplement the state statutes.

13

Congress

In fact, the role of the state proceedings in the

14

Title VII scheme was so integral that Senator Humphrey was

15

lead to describe Title VII as a states' rights or states'

16

responsibility bill.

17

The importance of a multi-remedy approach to Eradicat­

18

ing employment discrimination

19

was amended to correct certain deficiences in the statute and

20

to strengthen the national policy against employment discrimina­

21

tion.

22

.. was reiterated in 1972 when Title VII

Again, the importance of a multi-remedy approach on

23

the state level, on the local level, and on the federal level

24

to irradicate employment discrimination was reiterated.

it, has suggested that what all of this means is that ERISA
would invalidate New York's substantive law, but not its pro­
cedural law, if you will.

Would you address yourself to that

at some point in your discussion?
MS. BACHRACH:

As I understand the Solicitor's

suggestion, he is saying that this Court need only reach
the situation where New York law provides more protection than
state law, but need not reach that situation where the protections
are identical.
However, ERISA permits no such distinction».
not support the Solicitor General's approach.

It does

ERISA seeks to

impairing any federal law and it would impair Title VII equally
if the New York Human Rights Law were preempted to the extent
it went beyond Title VII or to the extent it provided identical
protections and in procedural protection.
QUESTION:

It requires sort of a strained interpreta­

tion, doesn't it, to say that New York law is a federal law?
MS. BACHRACH:
a federal law.

We don't suggest the New York law is

What we suggest is that when Congress developed

the Title VII scheme, the foundation was the state laws.
Congress was aware, and has always been aware, that state laws
were not identical to the federal law.
And, in fact, it discussed New York law in 1964 and
noted that New York's protections were greater than those being
offered by Title VII and Congress intended the states' law

to

survive, to be utilized as part of the Title VII process; to

2

give states the opportunity to apply their laws first, and,

3

indeed —

4

QUESTION:

You can say that, and you are perfectly

5

correct so far as Title VII is concerned.

6

state laws to survive and to be used.

7

different question to say that that made the state laws that

8

were allowed to survive the federal law.

9

MS. BACHRACH:

Title VII did intend

But, I think it is a

First of all, New York does not, by

10

any means, suggest that it is a federal law, but rather to

11

preempt New York's law would impair the federal scheme.

12

13

QUESTION:

Simply because it was allowed to survive

after Title VII?

14

MS. BACHRACH:

No.

That is obviously the first

15

step of our analysis, but it was intended to go beyond.

16

Congress designed Title VII, it intended the states to go

17

beyond Title VII.

18

So, if this Court preempts the New York law to the extent it

19

goes beyond Title VII, small employers in this country will

20

face no prohibitions against employment discrimination, because

21

Title VII only covers employers with more than 15 employees.

22

When

Title VII provided only the minimum protection.

QUESTION:

But, really Title VII left the decision

23

as to employers below of 15 or less up to the individual states,

24

didn't it?

25

MS. BACHRACH:

Yes.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

7

1

QUESTION:

It was really neutral as to what kind of

2

policy the state enforced with respect to employers of less

3

than 15.

I think it would be more accurate to

5

say that it encouraged the states to take the first step to

irradicate employment discrimination.

8

national level.

9

QUESTION:

It was a problem on the

Well, why do you say that it encouraged —

10

That it is not accurate to say it is simply left up to the states,

11

but rather the states were, in your words, "encouraged to take

12

the first step?"

13

Would you have some of the legislative history?

MS. BACHRACH:

I think that if we look at the

14

legislative history in 1978, when Congress was considering the

15

Pregnancy Discrimination Amendment —

QUESTION:

17

MS. BACHRACH:

Yes, it was obviously — The history

was three and four years later.

JUSTICE BRENNAN:

4

You may proceed, 11s. Bachrach,

when you are ready.
MS. BACHRACH:

5

May it please the Court, at the lunch

6

break, I was discussing the 1978 Pregnancy Amendment to Title

7

VII.

8

make clear that Congress assumed that state laws prohibiting

9

discrimination on the basis of pregnancy were in effect and

At that time, both the Senate report and the House report

e

10

would remain so after the Pregnancy Amendment.

11

The House report and the Senate report examined the

12

experiences of employers in states prohibiting discrimination

13

on the basis of pregnancy and more than 23 states have laws

14

prohibiting such discrimination.

15

experience at the state level, both the Senate and the House

16

reports concluded that the economic impact of these pregnancy

17

amendments would not be unduly burdensome, because employers

18

in more than 23 states were already under state law obligation

19

to provide equal benefits for pregnancy and related medical

20

conditions.

21

And, based on that, on the

Now, this is particularly significant since the major

22

impact of the Pregnancy Amendment was in the context of employee

23

benefit plans, medical plans, health plans, disability plans.

24
25

The co-sponsor of the Pregnancy Amendment were Senators
Williams and Javits, who were two of the principal architects of

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

9

1

ERISA and it is never doubted for a moment in 1978 that state

2

laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of pregnancy were

3

in effect and would remain so in the future.

4
5

6

In fact, Senator Williams described these amendments
as reinforcing state laws prohibiting employment discrimination.
ERISA, the legislative history to ERISA, in 1974

7

also underscores that Congress intended state laws prohibiting

8

discrimination in employee benefit plans, all state laws to

9

remain in effect.

10

ERISA does not include a non-discrimination provision,

11

although in the debates it was stated on more than one occasion

12

that discrimination in benefit plans was to be considered one

13

of the most serious forms of discrimination.

14

Members of the House and Senate were dissuaded from

15

offering a non-discrimination amendment to ERISA only upon being

16

reassured by ERISA's sponsors that Title VII non-discrimination

17

provisions would be fully applicable.

18
19

20

QUESTION:

And, they remain fully applicable, do they

not, Title VII non-discrimination provisions?
MS. BACHRACH:

If this Court reverses the Second

21

Circuit, they would remain —

22

QUESTION:

Title VII non-discrimination provisions

23

are contained in the substance of Title VII, aren't they?

24

since it is a federal law, it would not be preempted by ERISA.

25

MS. BACHRACH:

We would suggest otherwise.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

And,

We would

10

1

suggest that Title VII non-discrimination provisions start with

2

Title VII and go beyond Title VII and go into the states, because

3

the states —

4

QUESTION:

5

MS. BACHRACH:

What do you mean, "go into the states?"
That the federal scheme in Title VII

6

was built on the laws in effect in 1964 in the states.

7

when Congress developed the scheme, Congress intended the state

8

laws to remain in effect and it was aware at that time, in

9

1964 —

10

QUESTION:

And,

There is no question that Congress intended

11

in 1964 that those laws remain in effect if they were in effect

12

in the states.

13

the question is what did Congress mean when they enacted ERISA

14

in 1974?

15

otherwise exempted from preemption by some other statute.

16

It left that entirely up to the states.

But,

It saved only federal laws, not state laws that were

MS. BACHRACH:

I would state it slightly differently

17

and I would say that what Congress did in 1974 was to make sure

18

that nothing would — That the preemption provisions of ERISA

19

would not be construed as to even alter in any way the protections

20

of any federal law.

21

QUESTION:

Well, do you mean that what Congress did

22

in enacting ERISA was, in effect, to say Title VII saves state

23

laws in this respect and ERISA continues that scheme.

24

what you are saying?

25

MS. BACHRACH:

Yes, and more.

Is that

Not only that. Title VII

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

11

1

saves state laws, but it utilizes those state laws and it

2

encourages the states to go further.

3

The Solicitor General seems to suggest that this

4

Court could come up with a workable preemption formula which

5

would save state laws that are identical to Title VII and only

6

preempt state laws which provide greater protection than Title

7

VII.

8
9

We would suggest that there is no workable formula
because identity of statutory language does not mean that the

10

state law and the federal law give the same protection and this

11

case amply demonstrates that, because in 1976, New York State's

12

Human Rights Law forbid discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.

13

Excuse me.

15

crimination, but in December 1976, this Court and the New York

16

Court of Appeals reached contrary conclusions as to whether or

17

not that prohibition against sex discrimination included

18

discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.

19

In 1976, New York State's Human Rights Law prohibited
In 1976, Title VII prohibited sex dis­

So, if we try to fashion some formula which says which

20

state laws fall on which side of the line, we are confronted

21

with quite a problem, or, better yet, the EEOC would be con­

22

fronted with a problem, because every time the complaint of

23

discrimination in a fringe benefit plan was filed with EEOC,

24

before it could decide whether to defer to the state agency, as

25

it is required to do by Title VII, it would first have to

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

12

1

determine what state law said on the subject of this type of

2

discrimination.

3

said on this type of discrimination and only if state law and

4

federal law were identical could it then defer to the state

5

agency.

6

It would then have to decide what federal law

QUESTION:

I don't think I understood the Solictor

7

General's suggestion in quite the same way.

8

that what was being suggested was that New York can regulate

9

the employer but not the plan and that New York could require

10

employers to set up certain, for example, disability benefits,

11

plans, that do govern solely the benefits within the State of

12

New York for that employer and could seek enforcement in that

13

fashion.

14
15

MS. BACHRACH:

It appeared to me

I believe that was the Solicitor's

argument only as to the Disability Benefits Law.

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. BACHRACH:

Right.
And, as to the Human Rights Law, the

18

Solicitor General took the position that New York State's Human

19

Rights law was preempted to the extent it provided protection

20

beyond Title VII and it urged this Court not to reach the

21

situation where the two statutes appear to be congruent.

22

However, we would suggest it is impossible to make

23

any dividing line between what appears to be the same language

24

in theory and in practice how state courts and the federal

25

courts have interpreted that language which may not always be

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

13

the same.
If New York State's Human Rights Law is preempted,

3

the EEOC would be unable to defer any complaints of employment

4

discrimination in benefit plans to state agencies.

5

mean that the caseload of EEOC would rise dramatically.

6

would also mean that the caseload of the federal courts would

7

rise dramatically since the EEOC has no authority to order the

8

employer to provide any relief.

This is contrary to the decisions of this Court which

14

have taken pain to preserve state authority in the area of

15

employment discrimination.

16

Just last term in the Kremer case this Court looked

17

at the relationship between state laws and federal laws in

18

this area and it noted the importance of state proceedings to

19

federal law in the area of employment discrimination and as a

20

result of that this Court held that state judgments, state

21

court judgments, in the area of employment discrimination were

22

entitled to full phase and credit in the federal courts.

23

other decision would have violated basic tenants of federalism

24

and would have served to decrease the incentive for states to

develop effective and meaningful employment discrimination

I cannot think of anything that would serve

to

reduce the incentive on states to develop effective and meaning­
ful employment discriminations than to say that states may not

prohibit discrimination in any employee fringe benefits, child

6

care, health benefits, pension benefits, training programs,

7

apprenticeship programs.

The state system would be effectively torn down by
not allowing us to prohibit those forms of discrimination which

QUESTION:

That simply isn't correct.

I think Title

22

VII was put together because Congress felt many states weren't

23

doing much about employment discrimination and that a national

24

law was necessary because there was such unevenness in the states.

25

Do you disagree with that?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

16

1

MS. BACHRACH:

No.

But, I think it goes beyond that,

2

that Congress hoped and, indeed, set up a system to encourage

3

states to enter the field and that is why it required the 60-day

4

deferral, the deferral to state agencies to irradicate this

5

form of discrimination; to apply state law in its entirety,

6

state rules of evidence, state rules of damages, would all apply,

7

not simply for states to apply federal law, but for states to

8

apply state law and to get a handle on the types of pernicious

9

employment discrimination that Congress recognized in '64 and

10

that the states recognized in the years to come.

11

As I see that my time is running short, I would like

12

to briefly address the problem of ERISA preemption of the New

13

York State Disability Benefits Law, because if the Second

14

Circuit's decision is affirmed, New York will be unable to

15

apply its Disability Benefits Law to any employer unless that

16

employer happens to maintain disability benefits in a separate

17

administrative unit.

This decision will wreak’havoc —

22

initially and in that paragraph it is very

MS. BACHRACH:

Yes.

I understand that the starting

23

point must be the language, but this Court has never hesitated

24

to look beyond the language when to focus solely on the language

25

would lead to absurd results.

And, I think that is demonstrated

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

18

1

by the literal reading suggested by the airlines here which is

2

to focus on the purpose for which the employer is providing

3

disability benefits.

4

The airlines suggest that that purpose can be gleaned

5

from the type of benefits provided and if employers provide

6

benefits beyond what is required by state law, then the

7

employer is not maintaining a plan solely for the purpose of

8

complying with state law.

9

If we follow that out, an employer who maintains

10

less benefits than is required by state law or no disability

11

benefits at all, is also not maintaining a plan solely for the

12

purpose of complying with state law, because, indeed, that

13

employer is not complying with state law.

14

So, what you have is preemption determined by the
employer's good will, economic judgment, and —

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GORDON DEAN BOOTH, JR., ESQ.

9

You may.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

10

MR. BOOTH:

May it please the Court:

In this case

11

we have a situation which one would hope would be more usual

12

where the statutory language is thoroughly consistent with the

13

legislative history which is thoroughly consistent with the

14

policies sought to be effectuated.

15

It is clear that Congress was keenly aware of the

16

fact that all federal taxpayers have a stake in employee

17

benefit plans through federal economic encouragement plans,

18

either through delayed and preferential taxation or through

19

tax policies allowing certain benefits to employees to be

20

totally free of tax to the employee although deductible to

21

the employer.

22

It is also clear that Congress adopted a policy that

23

lead to the statute, ERISA, designed to encourage the voluntary

24

establishment, growth, and expansion of private employee benefit

25

plans.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20

1

It is clear that Congress believed that one way to

2

foster and encourage the growth and development of employee

3

benefit plans was to give the plan designers and participants

4

the maximum possible flexibility consistent with other federal

5

laws in selecting and allocating the resources available for

6

employee benefits.

7

It is clear that Congress believed the plan should be

8

allowed to be administered uniformly throughout all of the

9

United States.

10

It is clear that Congress believed that the plan should

11

be allowed to be uniform and equitable among their participants

12

throughout all of the United States.

13

It is clear that Congress believed that without pre­

14

emption of state laws, interstate plans could not maintain

15

uniformity and equity among participants throughout the United

16

States.

17

It is clear that Congress thought that state laws

18

affecting employee benefit plans might result in slowing down

19

the growth or even the possible elimination of some employment

20

benefit plans.

21

It is clear that Congress believed that the federal

22

government's interest in employee benefit plans was comprehensive

23

and pervasive and it is clear that Congress believed that this

24

pervasive federal interest required, with certain narrow

25

exceptions, the displacement of state action in the field of

The deferral for enforcement —

QUESTION:

That is right, Your Honor.
Isn't that begging the question, because

the statute, at the time it was enacted, there was a state law.
Right before ERISA became effective, there was a state statute
in effect in New York.

The federal statute says, "enactment

of ERISA shall not alter federal statutues."

Prior to the

date of enactment, there was a state law which involved a
deferral procedure.

Subsequent to the date of the statute, if

I understand your argument, there was no longer a deferral pro­
cedure.

Was there or was there not an alteration of the federal

law?
MR. BOOTH:

Your Honor, there was a deferral procedure

in Title VII before and after ERISA was passed.
QUESTION:

Secondly, we want back pay because you miscalculated my

seniority.

What does the EEOC do with such a claim?

It defers

not for the other part.
MR. BOOTH:

I guess that —

I don't know what they do, but I would

assume they do the same thing they do now if the employee com­
plains about discrimination on the basis of marital status or
sexual orientation or disability or any of the other bases for
state discrimination that do not apply in the federal area.
It is possible that an employee today would have a great deal
of different views as to why he was discriminated against which
is a point I was about to make.
It is not always clear what is fair and unfair.

This

12

The Appellees, therefore, submit that it must be

concluded from a legislative history, the plain language of

the statute, and the policies sought to be effected, that

15

Congress intended to preempt all state laws relating to employee

benefit plans; that it was fully aware of the broad nature of

17

the language it selected; that it knew that some statutes might

18

be preempted which had not been specifically considered; and

19

that it nevertheless made a considered judgment to preempt all

20

law relating to employee benefit plans.

21

It had some concern that attention might be needed to

22

deal with specific problems in the future because of this blanket

23

approach and it therefore created a commission specifically

24

charged to study the effects of preemption among other things.

25

It cannot be denied that Congress was fully aware of

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

35

1

the comprehensive nature of this provision and nevertheless

2

decided that the public and the nation would be better served

3

by having only federal standards apply in this relatively narrow

4

area in order to encourage the growth of plans as well as the

5

expansion of plan benefits without whatever inhibiting or

6

chilling effects which would or might result from state involve­

7

ment through the application of any law relating to an employee

benefit plan.

9

Insofar as the Disability Benefit Law is concerned,

10

the state cannot claim that the employee benefit plans of the

11

Appellees are free from ERISA coverage.

12

statute for Disability Benefit Laws is clearly related to plans

13

not subject to the coverage of ERISA.

14

definition and the exception is to ERISA coverage.

15

The exception in the

This is a coverage

It has been suggested that while the Appellees plans

16

may not be exempt from ERISA coverage, nevertheless, certain

17

paragraphs or portions of the employee benefit plans are exempt

18

from coverage and, therefore, because they are exempt from the

19

coverage of ERISA, are subject to state regulation within the

20

exception.

21

ERISA, however, indicates that the term "plan" refers

22

to an integral unit or programs

23

provisions of a plan.

24
25

not to isolated and subsidiary

It has also been suggested that a ruling following
the plain language of the statute would require a determination

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

36

1

as to whether or not a plan is maintained solely to comply and

2

that this would impose an impossible intent test on the statute

3

which would in turn allow wide-spread avoidance of state law.

4

Even if it could be assumed that employers would seek

5

to be regulated by ERISA instead of the state, there is no

6

reason to conclude that a purpose or intent test is so difficult

to apply.

laws, criminal laws, anti-trust laws to name but a few.

in this application.

The Appellees submit that the question for determination

13

by this Court is does ERISA preempt state statutes that regulate

14

the nature of the benefits an employer must provide in his ERISA

15

regulated employee benefit plan.

16

The Appelles submit that this Court should find that

17

a state statute that eliminates or adds to an ERISA covered

18

employee benefit plan features that are committed or not required

19

by federal law is preempted by Section 514 of ERISA.

20

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT ON DEBORAH BACHRACH
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT — REBUTTAL
MS. BACHRACH:

The Appellees argue that the Human Rights

4

Law is preempted in its entirety to the extent it seeks to pro­

5

hibit discrimination in employee benefit plans and that that

6

would not impair Title VII because Title VII envisioned a joint

7

enforcement scheme between the state and the federal government

8

only to enforce federal law, but that simply is not correct.

9

The deferral provisions of Title VII were for the

10

state agencies, the state fair employment agencies, to apply

11

state laws in their entirety so that if a complaint of race

12

discrimination in a medical plan was first filed with EEOC,

13

the EEOC would defer immediately to the state agency to allow

14

the state to apply its law in its entirety without any

15

preliminary determination of whether, in fact, the state law

16

might provide greater protection under the rubic of race

17

discrimination than would federal law.

18
19

Title VII envisioned state enforcement of state law
in the area of employment discrimination.

20

Thank you.
