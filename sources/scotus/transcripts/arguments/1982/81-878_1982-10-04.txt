CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

We will hear arguments

next in Larkin v. Grendel's Den.
Hr. Caruso, I think you may proceed whenever
you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GERALD J. CARUSO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

HR. CARUSOs

9

Mr. Chief Justice ani may it please the Court*

10
11

Thank you. Your Honor.

This case raises a question concerning the
state's power to regulate alcoholic beverages.

The

12 state law at issue is Massachusetts General Law, Chapter
13

138, Section 16(c).

That statute prohibits the issuance

14 of a liquor license to any establishment located within
15 500 feet of a church or school if the church or school
16 objects to the issuance of the license.
17

The Massachusetts Supreme Court addressed the

18 issues presented here and upheld the constitutionality
19 of the statute.

The First Circuit Court of Appeals

20 concurred in that ruling, but reversed itself in an en
21

22

banc decision which is now the subject of this appeal.
The First Circuit ruled that Section 16(c)

23 violates the establishment clause.

In the First

24 Circuit's view, the statute has the primary effect of
25 advancing religion because it extends to churches but

3

1

not to all similarly situated institutions a more than

2 de minimis benefit.

3

In defense of the en banc decision/ Grendel's

4 advances an alternative rationale.

In Grendel's view,

5 the statute improperly delegates legislative power to
6 churches and thereby violates the establishment clause.

7

The state contends that Section 16(c) embodies

8 a legislative effort to accommodate competing interests

9 and to control the placement of liquor licenses in
10

Massachusetts.

He also contend —

QUESTIONS

12

MR. CARUSOs

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Caruso.
Yes.

f

Could I ask you a question about the

14 procedure followed by the Court of Appeals before you
15 get any more deeply into the merits?
16

MR. CARUSOs

17

QUESTION:

Sure.
As I understand it, the Plaintiffs,

18 the Respondents here, asserted a couple of
19 constitutional claims and a statutory antitrust claim in
20 the district court, did they not?
21

MR. CARUSOs

22

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And then all of those went up on

23 appeal to the First Circuit?
24

MR. CARUSOs

25 went up on appeal.

Yes.

There were three claims that

Initially, the case was brought as

applied and facially, I might point out.

When it was

2 filed in the district court, it was filed both as an as
3 applied attack to the challenge and a facial challenge
4 to the statute.
5

The district court, after Grendel's — the

6 Commonwealth moved to dismiss and asked the district
7 court to abstain on the as applied section of the
8 complaint, the district court denied our motion to
9 dismiss, we then entered into an agreement of facts and
10 contested claims with Grendel's.

Those claims were due

11 process, establishment clause, and equal protection, and
12 the Sherman Act claim.
13

QUESTION s

And all of those ~

14

HR. CARUSO:

All of that went up to the First

15 Circuit.
16

QUESTIONS

Well, in view of all of our talking

17 in our opinions about how at least this Court, and I
18 think we've said other federal courts too, should first
19 address statutory claims before they reach
20 constitutional claims, isn't it a little odd that the
21 First Circuit addressed constitutional claims and didn't
22 resolve the statutory claim?
23

MR. CARUSO:

Well, insofar as the statutory

24 claim was the supremacy clause claim under the antitrust
25 laws, Your Honor, I think the First Circuit — I don't

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

know why the First Circuit chose to proceed the way it

2 did on the en banc review.
3

If the statutory claim was the antitrust action

4

that Your Honor is concerned about, that we look at as a

5

supremacy clause claim, on whether the statute should be

6

struck down under the supremacy clause.

7

basis of Grendel's's claim.

8

prior to the Rice decision coming down, we defended

9

against that by claiming that the Sherman state action

10

exemption applied.

11

that.

That was the

The district court disagreed with

I don't know if I answered your question.

18

QUESTIONS

Yes.

The antitrust claim is, as
Those two claims lay back

But it wasn't as if the antitrust

claim hadn't been appealed to the First Circuit.

The

20 First Circuit had it before it and simply chose not to
21

address it.

22

MR. CARUSOs

23

QUESTIONS

24

HR. CARUSOs

25

Yes, Your Honor.

I should —

Not to dispose of it.
I should also add. Your Honor,

that the original panel of the First Circuit did address

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that claim.

Judge Campbell in his decision upheld the

2 district court's action holding, saying that the Sherman
3

-- the state action exemption did not apply.

4

banc panel did not address it.

5

QUESTION*

The en

The First Circuit said first of all

6 that you weren't entitled to summary judgment on your

10

11

antitrust claim.
ME. CARUSO*

That's what the court said in

essence, yes.
QUESTION:

Mr. Caruso, I'm just curious.

The

initial panel decision was three Court of Appeals

12 judges, wasn’t it?
13

MR. CARUSO:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. CARUSO:

And the en banc was also three?
Yes, Your Honor.
How'd that happen?
Well, the First Circuit, as you

16

know. Your Honor, consists of four judges.

17

panel was made up of Judge Campbell, Judge Coffin, and

18

Judge Hoffman out of the Eastern District of Virginia.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. CARUSO:

21

The original

Oh, I see, sitting by designation.
Right.

Now, when Grendel's

applied for a rehearing en banc, petitioned for a

22 rehearing en banc. Judge Briar recused himself because
23

of my brother’s participation in the case.

24

taught at Harvard as well.

25

Judge Briar

So that left Judge Barnes, Judge Coffin and

2 banc.

They all voted to grant rehearing en

So it was the difference of one judge that

3 changed the constitutional issues here, results.
4

QUESTION*

Had the case remained on the

5 statutory basis, would we be here now on this case?
6

HR. CARUSO*

7

QUESTION*

I'm sorry. Your Honor?
Had the case been resolved on the

8 statutory grounds?
9

MR. CARUSO*

Hell, I think insofar as Grendel's

10 was challenging our statute under the antitrust laws and
11 essentially claiming that the federal court should
12 strike down the statute because it violated the
13 antitrust laws, I frankly, after this Court's decision
14 in Rice v. Norman Williams, don't think that Grendel's
15 claim is going to prevail there.
16

QUESTION*

But in any event, it's another

17 constitutional issue.
18

MR. CARUSO*

It is another constitutional issue

19 and it is somewhere in this proceeding that we engage
20 in.

We think it's back in the district court.

Of

21 course, if this Court chose to uphold the en banc
22 panel's decision, all that would be for nought anyway.
23

The state contends, as I said, that the statute

24 embodies a legislative effort to accommodate competing
25 interests and to control the location of liquor licenses

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

in Massachusetts

We also contend that the statute is

2 well within our broad Twenty-First Amendment police
3

powers, and it neither advances religion nor creates an

4

excessive entanglement with religion.
After briefly discussing the facts, we will

5

6 direct our argument to three main pointss

First, the

7 statute gives to churches only an incidental benefit,
8 which does not advance religion;
9

Second, the failure of

the statute to include all institutions similar to

10 churches and schools does not violate the establishment
11

clause.
QUESTIONS

12

Does it not delegate to a religious

13 institution a power that is perhaps thought to be a
14

governmental power?
MR. CARUSOs

15

No, it doesn’t. Your Honor.

16 That’s the final argument.

We will argue that Section

17

16(c) does not delegate legislative power to churches or

18

schools.

It simply permits them to waive an otherwise

19 applicable zoning prohibition on

the placement of liquor

20 licenses.

21

QUESTION;

Suppose the statute said that all

22 liquor licenses in Massachusetts shall be controlled by
23 a board consisting of the leader of
24 the

Protestant churches.

the Catholic Church,

You wouldn’t buy that, would

1

MR. CARUSOs

2

QUESTIONS

I would not buy that, Your Honor.
May I ask you the difference between

3 that one and this one?
4

MR. CARUSQs

Well, Your Honor, here this

5 statute represents the legislature's judgment of the
6 public interest.
7

QUESTIONS

8

MR. CARUSOs

So did the first one, I assumed.
No, Your Honor.

In that case the

9 legislature really -10
11
12

QUESTION:

Well, my hypothetical is the state

legislature passed it —
MR. CARUSOs

The state legislature has given to

13 churches in that case, or private persons for that
14 matter, anyone, the power to decide and not decide
15 whether or not a liquor license should issue.

That is

16 substantially different from this case.
17

QUESTION:

18

MR. CARUSOs

Like what?
Here the statute reads that no

19 premises shall be licensed if the governing body of the
20 church objects.
21

Here there is a legislative prohibition

which can be waived!

It's a legislative protection for

22 churches and schools, which can be waived.

And there

23 doesn't seem to be any dispute between the parties, laws
24 which permit individuals to waive otherwise applicable
25 zoning prohibitions do not delegate —

1

QUESTION*

Well, assuming I understand why a

2 church would not want a bar and grill in its
3 neighborhood, how do I understand that a church wants a
4 bar and grill next door?

I mean, what does that

5 promote, a situation where a church wants a bar and
6 grill next door to the church?

Now, what interest does

7 that promote?
8

ME. CARUSO*

Well, Your Honor, if I understand

9 your question correctly, and I may not, I think if you
10 look at the statute in the context of its historical
11

development, you get a better flavor for what the

12 legislature is promoting here.
13
14 ban.

The statute was initially active as a flat
It totally prohibited liquor licenses from being

15 issued within 500 feet of a church or school.
16 Subsequently the legislature amended the statute and
17 permitted the issuance of a liquor license, but the
18 license applicant had to go to the church and school and
19 solicit the assent of the church or school.
20

Finally, in 1970 the legislature amended the

21 statute further and permitted liquor licenses — or
22 relieved the applicant from soliciting the assent of
23 churches and schools, and placed the burden of objection
24 on the protected institutions.
25

So you see. Your Honor, what the legislature

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

has done here is, the legislature has decided that

2 churches and schools shall be protected with what we

3 might call a zone of tranquility, but the legislature
4 has also determined that if a church or school does not
5 have any objection to a liquor license being within its
6 500-foot zone of tranquility that the legislature is not

7 going to prohibit the license from being there any
8 more.

9
10
11

QUESTION;

How can you call it a zone of

tranquility with 14 licensees in the zone?
MR. CARUSO;

Your Honor, there's approximately

12 26 licensees in this zone.

13

QUESTION;

How can you call it a zone of

14 tranquility?
15

MR. CARUSO;

Hell, Your Honor, the purpose of

16 the statute was twofold.

The purpose of the statute was

17 to protect churches and schools from liquor license
18 establishments and the noise and dirt and abuse —
19

QUESTION;

And as soon as one is established,

20 why, that purpose has been frustrated.
21

MR. CARUSO;

22 this extent.

Hell, yes. Your Honor, only in

The second purpose of the statute was to

23 help facilitate the issuance of liquor licenses.

In

24 1954 when the statute was first passed, there were no
25 liquor licenses in Harvard Square in 500 feet of

12

whatever church existed there.

QUESTION;

Only to the extent —
You earlier seemed to be arguing

7 that the three statutes were functionally equivalent.

I

8 think now you're saying they're quite different.
•

9

MR. CARUSO:

I think they are functionally

10 equivalent, Your Honor.
11

QUESTION;

Well, hasn't there been a change in

12 policy from one that said you can't have any to one that
13 says you can have 26?
14

MR. CARUSO;

Your Honor, only to the extent

15 that the legislature now does not now —

QUESTION;

The same as when it prohibited them

How can that be the same as having 26?
MR. CARUSO;

Well, the legislature I think now

24 believes that if a church does not have — a church may
25 not object to one, to a liquor license, especially in a

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

congested area like Harvard Square, that’s around the

2 corner and up the street.
3

QUESTIONS

Nell, I understand.

But if you

4

phrase it in terms of the church objecting, then you’re

5

saying the legislature doesn’t have its own policy.

6 says, we’ll let the church decide what it wants,
7

8
9

and

that's a pure delegation, isn't it?
HR. CARUSO;

I think if the legislature had

that policy it would have.

But I don't think that's

10

what happened here, and that’s why the Massachusetts

11

Supreme Judicial Court as it went through the history

12

determined that the legislature — the legislature’s

13

policy remained essentially the same.

14

I also might point out. Your Honor, that here

15

we're dealing with a statewide statute.

16

applies not only to the Harvard Square area of

17

Cambridge, Massachusetts, but it also applies to the

18

Berkshire Hills and the Cape Cod and the islands off

19

Massachusetts.

QUESTION;

The statute

Mr. Attorney General, may a church

exercise what you characterize as a waiver on a

22 selective basis, so that it would allow a liquor store
23

in one building and deny it in an adjacent building?

24

MR. CARUSO;

25

QUESTION;

That is —
That’s permissible under the

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

statute?

2

MR. CARUSO*

3

QUESTION:

That is possible, Your Honor.
And that could be done arbitrarily,

4

with no reason, no standard prescribed by the

5

legislature.

Suppose one of the liquor stores was

6 operated by a friend of the bishop and the other not?
7

MR. CARUSO:

We would argue, Your Honor — and

8 this was why we asked that the district court abstain in
9

this case.

We would argue that in that case the person

10

could seek relief, administrative or judicial, from the

11

operation of the statute.

12

Judicial Court of Massachusetts and the ABCC will read

13

into any improper motives — will not permit improper

14

motives in a pleaded and proved case.

15

We believe that the Supreme

This one here is a facial challenge.

And it is

16

correct, Your Honor, that the Massachusetts legislature

17

does not require a reason by the church.

reason is presumed.

is objecting for legitimate police and safety and health

However, the

QUESTION:

How do you distinguish that from

2 giving the church, whatever church is picked out, the
3 power to issue the license?
4

MR. CARUSO:

How is it distinguishable?

Well, Your Honor, once the site i

5 established as being suitable, then the state remains
6 the official determining body as to whether or not the
7 liquor license would issue.

The church is merely given

8 an opportunity to waive a legislative prohibition.
9

And the statute. Your Honors, has to be viewed

10 against the background, the traditional background in
11 this country, of permitting abutters to waive
12 legislative zoning protections.

It must be viewed in

13 that —
14

QUESTION:

And is that true of all 26 other

15 licensed establishments in this zone?

Were they all

16 establishments which made an application which the
17 church could have objected to but did not?
18

MR. CARUSO:

No, Your Honor.

There are some

19 that were licensed prior to the passage of the statute.

QUESTION:

21

MR. CARUSO:

In 1954?

MR. CARUSO:

Which would make the consent issue

irrelevant?

13

MR. CARUSO:

14

QUESTION:

Right, Your Honor.
Isn't the consent issue made pretty

15

much irrelevant by cases like New Motor Vehicle Board of

16

California v. Orrin Fox, where the Court says that

17

almost any system of private or quasi-private law could

18

be subject to the same objection?

19

eviction, for example, becomes necessary only when the

Court approval of an

20 tenant protests his eviction, and he alone decides
21

22

whether he'll protest.
MR. CARUSO:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the very

next sentence, the Court cited to the Cusack case, which

was a case earlier —

The opinion below also seems to me

to read that even if a flat ban would be sustainable,

2 this conditional -- or this consent, the consent
3 provision,
4
5

renders it unconstitutional.

Do you think

it*s sort of an alternative holding?
MR. CARUSO:

It's very difficult to say what

6 the en banc panel was doing, Your Honor.

It seems to me

7 that the en banc panel said that if you give any benefit
8

to a church and do not include enough other

9 institutions, even a zoning benefit, then that zoning
10
11

benefit will be unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

Which has nothing to do with getting

12 a consent.

13

MR. CARUSO:

Right, Your Honor.

We think that

14 the en banc panel’s decision was much too broad.

QUESTION:

Do you know whether the attacks on

25

MR. CARUSO;

Yes, they have, Your Honor,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

I should

3

have been on both establishment clause and delegation

issues.

5

Mostly, the bans have been presumed, I think we

6 can fairly say, constitutional.
7

All commenters, all

textbooks and Am.Jur., they all assume that these flat

8 bans are constitutional, even though they don't contain
9
10

enough other types of institutions.
And I might say. Your Honors, that with regard

11

to the consent mechanism the cases seem to indicate that

12

when the use is offensive then they don't -- they permit

13

these types of-consent mechanisms when the use is an

14

offensive use or viewed as an offensive use.

won *t find many cases striking down these consent

provisions dealing with liquor establishments.

MR. CARUSO*

No.

If there were an

defend against it with the Twenty-First Amendment.

But

we do believe that the Twenty-First Amendment in this

MR. CARUSO:

Yes.
Are some of those cases — do they

sustain a consent mechanism where there have been some

offensive uses within the area and then they have been

permitted to object to an additional offensive use?

the Court
Let me begin by clarifying what I think are

3

some possible confusions about the facial and as applied

4

aspects of this case and about the Sherman Act.

5

think was not really odi that the First Circuit in its

It I

6 en banc rehearing did not resolve the statutory claim
7

first, because once the original panel of the First

8 Circuit had hell that Parker v. Brown was not a bar as a
9

matter of law to what might ultimately become an as

10

applied trial of our antitrust claims, there was no

11

longer much dispute about that.

12

We were not pressing beyond the original

13

complaint.

14

this law under the antitrust acts.

15

We have not pressed a facial challenge to

QUESTIONS

Do you think that's a permissible

16

posture under our cases, to say that we have a statutory

17

claim here but we’re not going tc press it right now,

18

we're going to press our constitutional claim?

19

MR. TRIBE*

Justice Rehnguist, I think it would

20 be problematic if they were at the same level, if they
21

were both facial claims.

The reason it's permissible

22 here is that we think there are very strong
23

constitutional reasons, principally under the

24

establishment clause, not to call Father Arkalian to the

25

stand and begin inquiring into what the motives were for

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the denial of the liquor license in this case.

2

Indeed, we think that, as this Court did in the

3

Lovell case, Lovell v. Griffin, and in other cases where

4

the gravamen of the attack, is to the sweeping and

5

unaccountable nature of the power delegated, that it

6 should, and that it was proper for the lower courts to,
7

resolve the facial challenge first.
QUESTIONS

8
9

But do you find any authority in our

cases for saying that in those circumstances you take

10

the constitutional claim before you take the statutory

11

claim?
NS. TRIBE:

12

Well, as Justice White pointed out,

13

there’s a constitutional supremacy clause claim in any

14

event.

15

Court ultimately decided on constitutional, rather than

16

statutory preemption grounds under the Williams Act.

Edgar v. Site last term is a case where this

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. TRIBE:

19

That’s still a supremacy clause.
That's right.

So there's no way of

avoiding a constitutional issue here, isn’t that right?

20 That is, I take it the point is that even the antitrust

It’s

6 perfectly clear that if there’s a violation of the
7

Sherman Act then the supremacy clause requires that it

be enforced.

9

MR. TRIBE:

Yes.

But Justice Stevens, I think

10

as Justice White is suggesting, the Court hasn’t treated

the preemption ground —

QUESTION:

But the doctrine of avoiding

constitutional issues would be served by addressing the

20
21

QUESTION:

If you won on the Sherman Act claim

we would avoid the constitutional issue.
MR. TRIBE:

Well, Your Honor, let me suggest

why that’s not quite true.

To win on the Sherman Act

22 claim, I think we would have to concede that the First

24

Act attack is implausible here.

25

that there’s a great deal in that.

We’d have to concede

But

12 in order to probe it, in order to probe it in the way

13 that would be necessary to ultimately succeed, we would
14 have to overcome another constitutional obstacle, the
15 obstacle that they suggest in their briefs when they
16 argue that administrative assessment of the church's
17 concerns — this is at page 85 of the Attorney General's

Has there a statutory claim in each

MR. TRIBE*

In each of those cases there

was a claim, but nonetheless a narrower ground was

20 available, namely an as applied invalidation.

21

But that was a choice between two

22 constitutional grounds, at any rate.

MR. TRIBE:

I think that's correct, Your

Honor.

The First Circuit doesn't have any

other practice, does it?
MR. TRIBE*

No.

That's correct, that is the

14

only opinion before this Court, is an opinion holding

15

that this law is unconstitutional on its face.

16

think in understanding that opinion it's necessary to

recognize that the entanglement difficulties of

assessing its validity as applied in a particular case

13 of your complaint.

Mr. Tribe, that's not a fair reading
In paragraph 12 you allege on

14 information and belief that certain congregation
15 members, because of their contributions to the parish or
16 otherwise, exerted substantial influence on the
17 governing board in order to protect themselves from

We ask for a declaration of two

20 kinds, Hr. Justice White.

We ask for a declaration that

QUESTION:

MR. TRIBE:

I understand.
And the only relief we sought was

3

not damages against the private parties.

4

relief we sought was a declaration that the church's

5

exercise of this veto, because of the underlying private

The only

officials.
It was at that point that the state officials

said, well, that's clearly an attempt to apply the

10

Sherman Act to state action, and it’s at that point that

11

the private action becomes relevant.

mandated these agreements.

13

an as-applied trial it could be shown, within the

14

confines of this Court's delimitation of the Parker v.

15

Brown doctrine, that the reason the veto was exercised

16

was anticompetitive agreements and therefore the state

17

officials should not have given effect to the exercise.

We therefore believe that at

But it would not be enough to prevail at that

19

The state has not

trial to show that there were some people who had

20 unlawful agreements, because that didn't hurt Grendel's
21

Den.

To prevail we would have to inquire into the

22 reason the veto was exercised.

That inquiry would

23

violate the establishment clause or at least would raise

24

serious problems.

25

QUESTION:

Why would it violate the

be, because we were persuaded by our contributors or,

Well, suppose we — suppose we

17

decided or suppose that you would even agree that there

18

was no entanglement problem in adjudicating this case on

19

an as-applied basis under the First Amendment.

20

should the Court be stuck with a stipulation between the

21

parties nevertheless to decide it on its face?

22

Now,

Let's just suppose that it’s claimed that the

23

statute is invalid both on its face and as applied.

24

Now, should the Court first get to the applied issue or

25

on its face?

38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. TRIBEi

Well, there are two

I*m afraid

2 that the only way I can answer that is to say that there
3 are two levels of as-applied analysis here.

One is to

4 say that when the statute is applied to create a
5 crazy-quilt like this, in which 14 licensees, some right
6 around the corner, some across the street, get a liquor
7 license and others don’t, that that is a violation of
8 the Constitution.
9

There's another kind of as-applied claim, which

10 is to suggest that in this case the veto was applied
11 either to exact contributions for the church or to
12 advance the church's religious beliefs.

Mow, what we

13 suggest is that either of those grounds is highly
14 problematic, the second because of the entanglement
15 involved in the inquiry into the motives of the church
16 and the first because the invalidity of this blank check
17 of absolute veto power that is handed to the church does
18 not depend upon the facts of the particular case.
19

If the state wants, as the State of

20 Massachusetts purports to want, to allow the views of
21 churches to be weighed and considered in making
22 judgments that accommodate religious needs, it has ample
23 means for doing that.

Indeed, the licensing authorities

24 of Massachusetts are ready to listen to the claims of
25 all neighboring abutters, all churches, all others, as

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to why they might not want liquor in the neighborhood or

2 why they might want it in some instances and not in
3
4
5

others.
QUESTION*

Putting aside your stipulations in

this case, are you representing to the Court your view

6 that there was no way to decide this case without
7

8
9

reaching constitutional issues?
MR. TRIBE*

Is that your position?

I don’t believe that this Court can

decide that the judgment — well, let me see.

I suppose

10

there’s no way to have resolved ultimately the claim

11

that Grendel’s wanted to advance, the claim that this

12 veto should not be enforced, without reaching some
13
14

constitutional issue.
QUESTIONi

As someone else has suggested to

15

you, the framing of the issues in the case doesn't

16

control the Court on what issue should be decided.

17

again, do you say there was no way the court could have

18

avoided the constitutional issue?

19

MS. TRIBE*

Now,

I think there is no way the court

20 could have avoided it, however we framed the question,
21

given the relief we sought, and surely the parties have

22 the right to seek particular relief.

The relief we

23

sought was the removal of the burden of this veto.

Now,

24

in order to gain that relief we would have to have shown

25

either that the delegation of veto power was

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

unconstitutional, which we believe we have shown both

2 under the due process clause and under the establishment
3 clause, or that the way in which the veto was wielded in
4 this particular case and the reasons for which it was
5 wielded — not just the private agreements that might
6 have lain behind it, the reasons the veto was exercised
7 — violated our rights, either because of the Sherman
8 Act or because of our rights under the Thirteenth and
9 Fourteenth Amendments.
10

We don't believe that there is any way the case

11 could have been framed to resolve that issue without
12 reaching a constitutional question of entanglement and
13 without reaching, even under the Sherman Act, the
14 question of preemption.

For that reason, we don't think

15 that a constitutional issue has somehow been foisted
16 upon the federal judiciary in this case.

Me think it's

17 unavoidable in the factual posture of a veto having been
18 exercised by a church.
19

QUESTIONS

Hr. Tribe, I’m embarrassed that I

20 haven't examined the Sherman Act claim more closely
21 before.

But am I correct in noting that you didn't sue

22 any of the alleged conspirators?
23

HR. TRIBE;

24

QUESTION*

That's correct.
That's a rather strange Sherman Act

25 claim.

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

HR. TRIBEi

Because our primary sense was not

2 — the complaint here really was that Grendel’s Den was
3

subject to the absolute discretion of one neighbor, the

4

church, and that that was fundamentally unfair, that it

5

was threatening to put them out of business, and that it

6

was subjecting them to the kind of power that the

7

framers never imagined that churches or other private

8 parties would exercise.
9

Now, as it happened, we also thought if we

10

could not establish that that fundamental proposition

11

was correct and that it was facially void, that at that

12

point we ought to have a right in the particular facts

13

of this case, despite the constitutional entanglement

14

problems, to see relief from this particular veto.

15

Suing the particular individuals in this case, rather

16

than seeking invalidation of the delegation of power,

17

would not have given the relief sought, which was this

18

liquor license, and in any event would have raised very

19

difficult problems of trial, given the entanglement

20

problems, of finding out why the church in fact

21

exercised its veto.

22

And therefore the harm that we sought relief

23

from, the denial of the license, was harm that could be

24

removed only by seeking declaratory or injunctive relief

25

against these state officials.

The power that was

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 exercised here, and I think this is important in light
2 of Justice Rehnquist’s question about New Motor v. Fox,
3 was not just the power to trigger a public inquiry.

In

4 New Motor v. Fox, as the majority pointed out in Justice
5 Brennan’s opinion, the only effect of .the refusal of the
6 old franchisee to tolerate the incursion by a new
7 franchisee was to open up a public hearing.
8

In this case the effect is far greater than

9 that.

The effect is absolutely and totally, as the

10 State Supreme Court ruled and as the State Commissioners
11

of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission said,

12 absolutely to veto the license permanently.

And during

13 the ten years in which that veto has been exercised,
14 others have been licensed.
15

Now, we don’t think that it is incumbent upon

16 Grendel’s Den to engage in a problematic inquiry into
17 the internal motives of the church, though if we had to
18 at trial we would certainly try, in order to obtain
19 relief under the rather simple proposition, which I
20 think the framers would have found self-evident, that
21 the owners of property cannot be told what to do with
22 their property in the unfettered, unreviewable,
23 unaccountable discretion of a single private body,
24 namely a church.

It was his point that, although he was an ardent

22 was his belief that the temptation to shade things a

25 cases.

And he was talking about a veto power wielded by

QUESTIONS

MR. TRIBE;

That wasn’t what I asked you.
Well, if it were a very narrowly

11

think the First Circuit suggested that it would be

unconstitutional — that is# if the state were to say

that we don’t believe that liquor and religion mix —

14

then the case would be much more like the decisions in

16

where this Court has said that that’s a permissible

17

determination.

18

But I do not

And it seems to me that the argument could

19

nonetheless be made that when a branch of Alcoholics

20

Anonymous has no veto power, that is when a branch of

Alcoholics Anonymous is not surrounded by a liquor-free

22 zone, when libraries and hospitals are not surrounded by
23

liquor-free zones, to surround certain churches with

those zones might still be preferential treatment.

that issue is not presented here.

unaccountable power to a single body whose

unaccountability is even greater than that of other

20 owners there isn't even an arguable barrier under the

the real motives.

They say it’s a benefit

8 to a narrow class.

QUESTION:

I take it your argument in your

10 brief and here is primarily on the consent.
11

MR. TRIBE:

That’s right.

And we don’t think

12 it matters whether you call it consent or waiver.

We

13 think frankly —
14

QUESTION:

Well, I agree.

But you’re not

15 urging a holding that flat bans are unconstitutional?
16

MR. TRIBE:

No, because we think that, just as

17 Justice Rehnquist would want to avoid the whole
18 constitutional issue, certainly that more difficult
19 constitutional issue should be avoided here.
20

What we’re saying is that this Court has never

21 upheld and should never uphold ’a provision whereby a
22 single private owner, especially a church, has an
23 unaccountable power over the livelihood and property of
24 others.
25

We also believe that this Court should not

Mr. Tribe, if you don’t rely on the

3

flat ban analogy, then your delegation argument, it

seems to me, would be equally strong if the power to

5

6 in the neighborhood.

MR. TRIBE:

7

That’s right.

Justice Stevens, we

8 make this entirely separate delegation argument, which
9

we think is strong enough to prevail whether it's a

10

church or not.

11

reasons because it’s a church:
First, that violates the establishment clause

12

13

We think it is strengthened for two

principle of not giving special privileges to churches;
But second, insofar as one might otherwise cure

14
15

a delegation by implying some power of review or

16

revision of the sort that the State Supreme Court here

17

refused to find in the earlier case that came before it,

18

that ability to review the motives of the delegatee is

19

drastically reduced when the power is delegated to a

20 church.
21

So in that sense and in that sense only, the

claim is made much stronger by virtue of the religious

22 character of the person to whom power is delegated.
23

QUESTION:

I take it your argument, however,

24

would invalidate the statute even if it gave — if it

25

was a very general consent provision.

QUESTION*

That's right
As long as a church was included/ it

3 would be invalid?
4

MR. TRIBE*

Under the establishment clause/ I

5 think that’s right. Justice White.

But that’s why it

6 becomes I think important, since someone might argue
7 that it violates the free exercise clause to excise
8 churches from that kind of power.

That's why we take

9 some solaca from the fact that our argument with respect
10 to the delegation of power generally does not depend on
11 the fact that it’s a church.
12

I want to stress that this Court has never

13 upheld unilateral power in a single property owner to
14 determine, without public review or accountability, how
15 others may use their property.
16 Fox was not such a case.

Certainly New Motor v.

In New Motor v. Fox, one way

17 or the other during the time of the dispute between the
18 old and the new franchisee someone would have to be out
19 of luck.

This is a permanent deprivation as long as the

20 church maintains its veto.
21

QUESTION*

That thesis would avoid the

22 establishment clause problem, wouldn’t it?

MR. TRIBE*

It would certainly avoid the

They not only look old, but they’ve

Once.
That was once.

The reason I think they’ve rarely been cited is
that most people have followed them and obeyed them.

12 That is, the effrontery of a state in deciding that the
13

livelihood of a restaurant in Harvard Square is going to

14

depend on one property owner’s whim is something that

15

this Court has happily been spared in most cases.

16

This case is worse in a very special way.

In

17

all of those cases where the Court has gone in various

18

ways depending on factual nuances, at least it could be

19

said that a neighborhood of owners got to vote somehow

20 on whether a particular use would be allowed or not.
21

Never in this Court have we been confronted with a

22 situation where one owner has a decisive veto power over
23
24
25

an otherwise lawful activity.
And why someone who is subjected to that veto
should have to go through a trial and psychoanalyze the

51
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

reasons the veto was exercised, something that as a last

2 resort we would be willing to do, before the obvious
3 constitutional question is disposed of, is really beyond
4 me..
5

I don't think anything would be gained by it.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Tribe, do you think this Court's

6 opinion in Cusack was wrong?
7

MR. TRIBEs

Well, I think it was one of the

8 more difficult cases in the area.
9 wrongly decided, Justice O'Connor.

I think it was
But I think it's

10 distinguishable in several ways.
11

QUESTIONS

Well, is it distinguishable if we

12 apply the interpretation of Section 16(c) given it by
13 the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court?
14

MR. TRIBEs

Well, the Massachusetts Supreme

15 Judicial Court interpreted the purposes of the waiver as
16 — of the current veto, which they describe specifically
17 in their opinion as a veto.

They said this is the

18 delegation of a veto power at page 175A of the
19 Jurisdictional Statement Appendix.

They said its

20 purpose is really no different from that of a waiver.
21

It seems to me that this Court's cases — and

22 it's not up to the State Supreme Court to interpret them
23 — establish that it's not the underlying purpose of the
24 choice between waiver and veto that counts.

What counts

25 is that other private parties have been given the power

52
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to dispose of the fate of other private parties.
But even if Cusack were controlling and one

2

3 said this is a waiver, there'd be a fundamental
4 difference.

In Cusack, the owners of over half the

5 property in the area had to vote on the matter.

It was

6 a little like the referendum case in which the Chief

7 Justice upheld spot zoning by the City of Eastlake.
This Court could well hold that the guestion of

8

9 when property owners as a collectivity can be given a
10 kind of local option over the entry of nonconforming
11

uses, such as a billboard in a residential area, is a

12 difficult and different question from the question when

13 one property owner, not involved in Cusack or Roberge or
14 Eubank, can unilaterally dispose of how others may use
15 their property.
That question it seems to me can lead to only

16

17 one answer if the due process clause is to mean rule of
18 law rather than subjection to someone else's whim and
19 will.
