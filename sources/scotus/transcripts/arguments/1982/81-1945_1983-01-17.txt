ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. MC DONOUGH, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6
7

MR. MC DONOUGH*
please the Court*

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

There are two substantive issues before the
Court in this case.

The first is whether California can

10

place a moratorium on the construction of nuclear power

11

plants until the California Energy Commission, the

12

principal respondent here, has determined to its

13

satisfaction that there exists a demonstrated technology

14

or means for the disposal of high-level nuclear waste.

15

The second substantive issue is whether

16

California can refuse to permit a specific nuclear power

17

plant to be built in the state until the Energy

18

Commission finds that there are or will be facilities

19

with adequate capacity to store at any given time the

20

spent nuclear fuel produced by the plant plus all of the

21

fuel loaded into the plant's reactor at that point in

22

time.

23

The first of those issues is raised by the

24

enactment by California in

1976 of Section 25524.2 of

25

the California Public Resources Code, referred to in the
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

briefs as the waste disposal statute; and the second

2

issue is raised by the enactment in that same year of

3

Public Resources Code Section 25524.1(b), referred to as

4

the waste storage statute.
Petitioners contend that both of those statues

5
6

are invalid as preempted by the Atomic Energy Act of

7

1954, as supplemented by the Nuclear Waste Policy

8

Statute of 1982, which was signed by the President just

9

ten days ago.
There are also, however — there is also,

10
11

however, before the Court the question of the validity

12

or the -- the question of the justiciability of those

13

issues or the ripeness of those issues for

14

determination.

15

first.

16
17

And I shall address the ripeness issue

QUESTION;

Well, could I -- you mentioned a

statute that was recently passed.

18

HR. MC DONOUGH:

19

QUESTION;

20
21

Yes, Your Honor.

Now, would that be -- is that

statute arguably dispositive for one side or the other?
MR. HC DONOUGH;

It is in our view.

It is

22

supportive of the position that we are taking in this

23

case, Your Honor.

24
25

The statute --

QUESTION;

And contrary to the — contrary to

the Court of Appeals.

9

Well, the Court of Appeals

Oh, I no.

But it’s —

Yes.

But it’s contrary to their judgment.
Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Your

Honor.
Now, that statute was first called to this
Court's attention in our reply brief at page 13 when we

10

noted that it had then been enacted by Congress, not yet

11

signed by the President.

12

Court's attention last week by the letter of the

13

Solicitor General informing the Court that this statute

14

had been enacted.

15

QUESTION*

It was again called to the

Should the case be remanded then to

16

let the California court take a look at that new

17

legislation ?

QUESTION*

20

MR. MC DONOUGH*

Well —

In CA 9 —
-- Your Honor, it seems to us

21

that the case can be disposed and ought to be disposed

22

of by this Court taking account of that statute as well

23

as the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; but I take

24

it that would be a question for the Court to decide.

25

We will be making reference to the 1982

statute in the course of our argument this afternoon, as

2

I believe indeed the Solicitor General will.
QUESTION:

3
4

Do we have a copy of that in the

material you have filed with the Court, Mr. McDonough?
MR. MC D0N0UGH:

5

A copy of the statute, I*m

6

informed, was sent to the Court by the Solicitor General

7

last week.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. MC D0N0UGH:

10

Yes, it's only 60-some pages long.

Honor.

11

(Laugh tar.)

12

QUESTION:

13
14

It is a lengthy statute. Your

But your position is that you don’t

need that statute at all, I take it.
MR. MC D0N0UGH:

Well, our position is, Your

.15

Honor, that it — it stands as a reaffirmation of the

16

view of the federal government's responsibility for and

17

willingness to accept responsibility for and deal

18

effectively with the problems both of the disposal of

19

radioactive waste on a schedule set forth in the statute

20

and pursuant to procedures described in the statute, and

21

that it also deals extensively with the question of

22

interim storage of waste —

23

QUESTION:

And yet, Mr. McDonough, if the

24

statute had not been enacted, you'd still be here,

25

wouldn't you?

MR. MC DONOUGHs

QUESTION*

You’d rely then only on the

MR. MC DONOUGH*

5

QUESTION;

7

‘54

statute.

4

6

Indeed, I would, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.

In a sense you came before it was

enacted.
MR. MC DONOUGHs

Yes, indeed, Your Honor.

8

were here and all the briefs were filed, except the

9

reply brief by ourselves.

10

We

The statute was enacted, as I say, signed by

11

the President only on January 7, 1983.

12

it does — it represents the facing up, if you will, of

13

the federal government to two problems that are the

14

subject matter of the statutes before this Court; that

15

is to say, how will the nation deal with the problem of

16

the disposal of high-level nuclear waste, and how — and

17

before that problem can be solved, how will the nation

18

deal with the subject matter of the interim storage of

19

that waste pending its ultimate disposal.

20

But it does —

And in both of those respects the statute

21

assumes a federal responsibility, sets out procedures to

22

be followed by the federal government, and sets a

23

timetable for the accomplishment of objectives, and

24

specifically defines in each category the role of the

25

states, tha precise role which the states are to have in
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

dealing with this problem.
QUESTION;

2

But the only role of the states in

3

that statute is in the selection of the permanent

4

disposal site, isn’t it?

5

participation that’s involved there?
MR. MC D0N0UGH;

6
7

Isn't that all the state

Yes.

Your Honor, what the

statute does —
QUESTION;

8

That really doesn't have much to do

9

with the issue before us.

10

MR. MC D0N0UGH:

No, I think it does. Your

11

Honor.

12

as California has, with the problems of final disposal

13

of nuclear waste, on the one hand, and interim storage

14

of nuclear waste --

15

QUESTION;

16

The contention here is that the states may deal,

Well, California’s just saying we

want to wait until we know what the federal solution is.
MR. MC D0N0UGH:

17

Yes, Your Honor.

And I think

18

that the method from the statute is that Congress does

19

not want to wait, wants the subject matter of the

20

continued operation of nuclear plants to proceed, and

21

has set forth in detail the procedures to be followed to

22

that end.

23

QUESTION;

And it also made it rather clear

24

that the final federal answer won't be available for

25

several years.
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. KC D0N0UGH:

1

2

Well, the final federal

that’s right.
QUESTION!

3

And the question here is whether --

4

can the states say we want to wait until that answer is

5

-- I'm not suggesting one way or another, but I don't

6

really see that that bears on the preemption issue that

7

we have before us.
HR. MC DONOUGHi

8

9

Well, Your Honor, what our

position is with respect to the disposal of nuclear

10

waste, that the federal government has assumed

11

responsibility for that, has set out a procedure to be

12

followed to reach that end, has set a target date of

13

January 1, 1989 for the licensing of the first disposal

14

facility.

15

as we of course pointed out in our brief, that as far as

The NRC in the meantime has already decided,

16
17

QUESTION!

And the question — one of the

18

questions here is whether California can say we want to

19

wait until January 1, 1989 before we okay any more of

20

these plants.

21

MR. KC DONOUGHi

22

QUESTION!

23

MR. KC DONOUGHi

Yes, Your Honor.

As I —

That’s the question.
Well, all right.

The NRC has

24

already said in that respect insofar as it is concerned

25

the licensing of nuclear power plants by the NRC need
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

not wait the solution of the long-range disposal problem.
We think the statute in dealing with the

3

problem in the way that it has dealt with the problem

4

and does deal with the problem indicates, reaffirms the

5

federal government's view that this is a matter for the

6

federal government to decide, and that it should decide

7

all matters in relation to the problems of the disposal

8

of high-level nuclear waste; further affirms the federal

9

determination to go forward and solve that problem, and

10

therefore buttresses what we say is affirmed and found

11

in the '54 Act, as amended, in any event.

12

It does seem to be a current enactment of

13

considerable relevance to the issues before the Court,

14

and we thought that it ought to be brought before the

15

Court for its consideration.

16

Turning to the issues raised by the

17

respondents as to the justiciability of the questions

18

before the Court this afternoon, respondents have

19

contended that because the Court's writ brings before

20

the Court only the two statutes that I have mentioned

21

and not others, that the Court here really lacks Article

22

III jurisdiction.

23

That contention is based on the fact that the

24

action as filed below challenged the validity of a large

25

number of statutes included in California's
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Warren-Alguist Act» and in particular challenged the

2

validity of about a dozen statutes which taken together

3

set forth a procedure whereby one wishing to build a

4

nuclear power plant in California must file an

5

application for first a -- a — what's called a notice

6

of intention and later an application for certification»

7

and then engage upon a procedure in which the California

8

Energy Commission subjects that application to the same

9

kind of inquiries as are made by the NRC in the case of

10

an application for a license to build and later to

11

operate a nuclear power plant.
We said all of those statutes, which we

12
13

describe as the certification system statutes, were also

14

invalid.

15

decision, and so the contention is that we are not in a

16

position to get a redress from a decision of this Court;

17

that our injury is not redressable.

18

Those questions are not before the Court for

We have two responses to make to that, the

19

first of which is that a favorable decision by the Court

20

on the two issues before the Court this afternoon would

21

dispose of two discrete injuries to the petitioners

22

arising out of these statutes.

23

it would strike down the — the — the moratorium

24

statute and would as well strike down California's

25

attempt to become involved in the question of deciding

It would — it would —

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

how nuclear waste should be stored before it's disposed

2

of.

3

Such a favorable decision would also in — of

4

necessity set out the rationale of the Court's decision

5

in terms that could well be applicable and would be

6

applicable, we are certain, to the other statutes that

7

are challenged by petitioners or were challenged below.

8

And this particularly with respect to the waste storage

9

statute, because that really is functionally a part of

10

11

the certification system.
QUESTION*

I understood respondents'

12

contention to be, Hr. HcDonough, that your contentions-

13

had been kind of like perhaps Christmas trees in

14

parallel rather than in series; that it was the combined

15

effect of each and every one of these statutes that

16

caused you to be uncertain, your client to be uncertain

17

as to whether he could go ahead and build.

18

you couldn't challenge a part of this combined weight,

19

so to speak, there was no reason to think that just

20

partial relief was going to solve your problem.

21

MR. MC DONCUGH;

Yes.

And that if

Indeed that is his

22

position. Your Honor.

23

say first we will have this — we will have this

24

enlightenment from the Court which will afford an

25

opportunity at that point to reassess the situation of

Ky response to it is simply to

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the petitioners to see whether the concerns they felt at

2

the point in time that the action was filed are still

3

sufficiently valid to preclude them from going ahead.

4

The second point we would make in response to

5

this contention is that certain redressability by this

6

Court, its judgment or decision, has not always been an

7

absolute requirement of Article III jurisdiction.

8

that — in that respect we refer to the Orr against Orr

9

case decided in 1979 where the Court decided and struck

In

10

down the Alabama alimony statute because it did not

11

impose an obligation on both husbands and wives to pay

12

alimony, even though it was not certain at that point

13

that the husband petitioner would have relief by reason

14

of this Court’s decision, both because there was a

15

possibility that he was bound by contract in any event

16

to pay the alimony, and because the legislature of

17

Alabama might revise the statute to impose a duty on

18

both parties.

19

For those reasons we believe that the first

20

point raised by the respondents as to the ripeness or

21

justiciability of the issues is not well taken.

22

With respect to the ripeness of the moratorium

23

statute itself, we believe there simply that the Court

24

of Appeals was entirely correct.

25

the challenged statutes stand as an absolute barrier to

The court said that

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the construction of the proposed plants, and that that

2

barrier be removed by striking down the statutes.

3

would satisfy, we feel, the Article III component of

4

ripeness.

That

5

The court also said that the issue was purely

6

a legal one and that it would not be — its judgment on

7

that issue would not be helped significantly by delay,

8

and that delay would cause substantial hardship to the

9

utilities.

That, we think, was the appropriate decision
o

10

with respect to ripeness on that particular statute, and

11

that the same reasoning, the same rationalale should

12

have been applied by the Court of Appeals to Section

13

25524.1(b) for the same reasons; that is to say, it is

14

one of the statutes that constitutes a barrier.

15

issue is a legal one.

16

The

With respect to the issue of preemption

17

itself, in our view when California enacted these two

18

statutes in 1976 it could not have entered a more

19

preempted area of this subject matter of nuclear power

20

plants and their governance.

21

Congress has always accepted responsibility

22

for the — for the disposition, the storage and

23

disposition of nuclear waste.

24

the NEC has decided that it will not withhold its

25

licensing procedures or withhold a license merely

As I referred to earlier,

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

because the long-range disposal problem has not yet been

2

solved.
I referred earlier to the 1982 statute.

3

Let

4

me just incorporate that by reference, noting that what

5

it does is to set out with respect to both long-range

6

disposal and interim storage specific procedures whereby

7

the federal government assumes responsibility for

8

solving those problems within a short space of time, and

9

with respect to interim storage particularly, provides
•

10

that the federal government shall assist the utilities

11

to be certain that there will be ample interim storage

12

available until the depository problem is solved.
Hr. Chief Justice, I will reserve the balance

13
14

of my time until —

15

QUESTION*

16

question before you sit down?

Hr. HcPonough, may I ask you a

Is it your position that under the federal

17
18

legislation previously existing that the states can

19

determine whether to permit a power plant to be built at

20

all within a state?
HR. HC D0N0UGH:

21

Yes, Your Honor, in several

22

respects.

That is to say, first the state can decide

23

whether there's a need for any kind of a power plant and

24

decide that question negatively.

25

state can decide whether a particular power plant is too

expensive
QUESTION:

2
3

Can it decide that it wants a

nuclear plant or does not want a nuclear plant?
MR. MC D0N0UGH:

4

No.

It cannot decide simply

5

— the state, in our view. Your Honor, simply could not

6

pass a statute saying we will not have any nuclear power

7

plants in this state.

8

promoting, encouraging, fostering policy of the federal

9

government and — and the -- as expressed in the 1954

10

That runs counter to the

Act .
QUESTION:

11

Could it pass a statute saying we

12

will not have any hydroelectric plants in this states

13

we'll use only coal-fired plants?
MR. KC D0N0UGH:

14

Yes, Your Honor, I believe it

15

could.

16

different is the fact that Congress has evinced a strong

17

intention to have nuclear power plants as part of any

18

utility's mix, assuming that there is no — the states

19

cannot discriminate against nuclear power, let me put it

20

that way.

21

The thing that — that makes the situation here

Congress has done this in a variety of ways.

22

Your Honor.

First, they have made the nuclear materials

23

available to the private sector.

24

the technology available and have provided research and

25

development to develop that technology.

Second, they have made

Third, they

16

have price! — they have passed the Price-Anderson Act

2

which limits liability of the private operator and

3

provides funds to help them meet that financial

4

responsibility.

5

agency to license these plants and to give the public

6

confidence by its licensing process.

7

just as recently as ten days ago enacted new legislation

8

carrying forth the federal policy that there shall be

9

nuclear power plants.

10

Fourth, they have provided an expert

Fifth, they have

What we say is the states can apply those --

11

can make those decisions normally within its — its

12

capability of making, applying them in a

13

nondiscriminatory way against nuclear power plants.

14

What the states cannot do is to regulate the

15

construction or operation of nuclear power plants or the

16

interim storage or long-range disposal of nuclear waste.

17

QUESTION:

Well, you -- I take it if the state

18

— if there's an application to the state commission for

19

building a new coal plant —

20

ME. MC DONOUGHi

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

— And the commission says sorry,

22

but we don't need any more power plants in this state,

23

the fact that another entity comes in and applies for a

24

state permission to build a nuclear plant, even though

25

it's licensed by the federal authority, the state could
17

1

still keep that plant out.
MR. MC DCNOUGH;

2

Yes, sir.

If it was making a

3

nondiscriminatory application of a general decision by

4

that state not to have any new power plants -QUESTION*

5

And you say that — and you say

6

that that kind — you say that that kind of an economic

7

decision is not involved in this case.
MR. MC D0N0UGH;

8
9

Not involved in this case,

yes, Your Honor.

MR. MC D0N0UGH;

What we're saying is whether

they are statutes that deal with the very subject

the construction and operation of nuclear power plants.

First perhaps a word about the relevance of

the new statute enacted ten days ago.

It may be — we

can't say that it wouldn't — that it would be wholly

10

inappropriate for this Court to remand to the court

11

below to reconsider the case in light of that statute.

We do not urge that course because we are not at the

Congress has provided that in case there is a

MR. CLAIBORNEi

And that the federal

commission has approved that solution, and indeed that a

9

site has been selected.

And as Your Honor pointed out,

10

those procedures are ten years or seven years in the

11

future.

12

nothing further may occur.

13

And in the meantime, California has said
That delay is substantial.

Leaving the new statute aside and

14

concentrating on the federal laws that, in our view, at

15

all events control this case so as to require a reversal

16

of the judgment below, we wish to stress that what is

17

present here are two sorts of conflicts.

18

One is an actual present conflict between the

19

policy of the federal government through its nuclear

20

commission and the laws of California.

21

obviously illustrated in that the federal commission

22

continues to license nuclear power plants,

23

notwithstanding that there is as yet no

24

federally-approved final disposal solution, whereas

25

California says we disagree.

That is most

He will not allow any

1

plant to be certified or built in California until such

2

time as a federally-approved waste disposal system is

3

found.

4

with that solution.

And what is more, our legislature is satisfied

There is another sort of conflict, equally

5
6

serious, which is a conflict of jurisdiction*

who shall

7

decide these questions of storage and disposal?

8

California says we will determine, our commission must

9

determine whether in our view there is available storage

10

space, whereas the federal commission has determined to

11

license plants without requiring the kind of storage

12

facility that California leaves itself free to require.

13

If any area appears to us to have been wholly

14

preempted -- and this is most evident in Section 274(c)

15

of the '59 Act — it is the area of construction, design

16

and disposal of waste.

17

that *59 Act, like any other state, to make agreements

18

taking over the jurisdiction of the federal commission

19

with respect to fringe areas but not disposal or storage

20

of high-level nuclear wastes.

California is permitted under

California, like every other state, is

21

But the commission, the federal commission

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

responsibility with respect to storage and disposal, as

2

is made clear in Section 274(c).

3

Now, the section on which the respondents rely

4

and on which the court below relied was 274(k), an

5

inartfully worded provision which read most generously

6

might be read to suggest that California can regulate

7

any activity respecting the building or operation of a

8

nuclear power plant so long as it does it with a motive

9

other than protection against radiation hazards.
We suggest it cannot reasonably be read that

10
11

way in light of the other provisions of the act which I

12

have sketched, because otherwise it would mean that

13

notwithstanding the federal judgment that there is an

14

adequate means of disposal and an interim storage

15

capability, California could say we will ban all plants,

16

not for fear of radiation but because it's aesthetically

17

displeasing to us, it will, in our view, endanger the

18

environment other than through radiation —
QUESTION;

19

Well, can the states just say

20

nuclear power plants cost too much, and therefore we

21

don't want them?

22

maybe they cost too much because of the waste disposal

23

problem.

24
25

And is that what they've done?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Even --

In subsection (4) in the act?
I think the state has to

18

concede that since the moratorium is only effective

19

until such time as a federally-approved disposal system

20

per se produce electricity at too high a rate.

22

existence of the disposal system isn't going to change

the cost of production.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

that electricity may put their citizens at risk.

That

2

fear involves a second-guessing of the federal judgment

3

that there is no such problem of ultimate disposal, and

4

that fear is therefore not one on which California can

5

properly halt the licensing of nuclear plants.
And in this respect the new statute is of

6

7

special relevance because it says at the federal level

8

it has been determined — and indeed by Congress itself

9

-- that this problem will be solved.

You must,
«

10

therefore, California, put that out of mind as a pretext

11

for banning nuclear development in your state.

12

We completely agree that if California were to

13

say we need no electric power of any variety, they could

14

bar nuclear as well as any other generating facility.
QUESTION:

15

Mr. Claiborne, may I ask you one

guestion about your interpretation of 24.2, the

California statute that says that no nuclear fission

been met.

Mr. Claiborne says that the 1982 statute cuts

simple.

It is a state's authority to decline the

22

nuclear option simply as too uncertain, too costly, to

24

actual federal resolution and not simply by a commitment

25

to resolution, assured by actual federal resolution of

On the basis of a judgment that until we know

How do the people pay for this

MR. TRIBE:

Through higher rates that are

13

forced upon them for substitute electricity; that is, if

14

it were really assured in advance somehow that only the

15

shareholders in the utilities would end up suffering

16

when cost interruptions — when service interruptions

17

occur when shutdowns are ordered, we'd have a very

18

different nuclear industry in the United States.

19

It is precisely because investors can count on

20

the utility commissions to pass some of those costs on

21

that the situation is of fundamental concern to the

22

State of California.

23

I think it's important --

24

QUESTION;

MR. TRIBEs

2

Well, of course, I suppose if the

3

entire system of California were restructured so that it

4

were made bindingly clear in advance that in no

5

circumstances would costs be passed on, we'd have a

6

different case here.

Not at all.

need the help of the federal judiciary in finding

2

preemption where it has not been expressly adopted.

3

In the -- in

1982 Congress was asked to

4

preempt the field quite explicitly through something

5

called the McClure amendment, which would have said, as

6

petitioners and the United States seem to think it did

7

say, that we have in fact solved the waste disposal

8

problem or are certain that a solution will be available

9

on time.
That language in the Senate version which was

10
11

passed last year, and similar language which was

12

proposed to the House was expressly deleted.

13

Representative Ottinger, who played an important role in

14

the drafting the law, said it was deleted to avoid

15

preemption.
QUESTION;

16

And

Hell, the bills that Congress

17

didn’t pass have really never carried much weight here,

18

have they?

19

MR. TRIBE<

No.

I think, Justice Rehnguist,

20

certainly they haven't and shouldn't; but the provisions

21

that were specifically deleted in a bill of this kind at

22

least suggest that what the petitioners asked the

23

federal judiciary to do is something that the industry

24

has repeatedly asked Congress to do and Congress has

25

repeatedly refused to do, as in Dames and Moore v.

Reagan and in other such cases.
It seems quite clear that the significance of

2

3

congressional inaction may be ambiguous, but in this

4

case it's very clear, and the history leaves no doubt,

5

that Congress omitted the very language that would have

6

suggested there is no waste disposal problem.
QUESTION!

7

And, of course, one of the reasons

8

we don't give a great deal of attention to what Congress

9

didn't enact is perhaps some people voted against it

10

because they thought it was already there.
HR. TRIBE;

11

If the only issue before them was

12

preemption, that might have been true; but the thing

13

they voted against was a measure that would have

14

specifically declared the waste disposal problem is

15

solved, and any legal requirement that requires its

16

solution as a precondition of licensing more nuclear

17

plants shall be deemed satisfied.
That's, of course, what I think that the

18
19

petitioners and the United States want to make out of

20

this act.

21

is say that there shall be some federal backup interim

22

storage which amounts by the year 2000 to about 3

23

percent of the amount of storage space that even the

24

Department of Energy says will be needed.

25

the problem of permanent waste disposal by perhaps the

3

Promising it will be solved is very nice, but

4

there are a lot of places that we could go off track.

5

state could veto it under this bill, could veto a

6

location for a repository; and unless Congress and the

7

President override the veto, we're back to ground zero.

And in any event, you cannot mandate by law the solution

to a technological problem.

If this

Well, I suppose in 1973 the

federal government's concern might have been that we

need to have less dependence on oil, more dependence on

nuclear power; and therefore, we might enact a law

nuclear power on the shelf.

pervasive as the FPC's control over hydroelectric power;

3

that it should be treated as a national resource to be

That proposal was debated.

It was opposed by

6

Senator Hickenlooper on the specific ground that it

7

would be a federal usurpation of state sovereignty to

give the Atomic Energy Commission that broad a role.

And it was replaced by the much narrower role of federal

That’s '54.

5

Now, in 1959 the decision was made that the

6

Nuclear Regulatory Commission, then the AEC, could

7

relinquish some of its power over radioactive materials

8

under agreements with the states, but not all of its

9

power.

That is, there was a reservation in Section

10

274(c) of the NRC’s power to protect the public from

11

radiation hazards from certain activities, particularly

12

the operation of nuclear power plants and the disposal

13

of their waste.

14

But even that had an exception, and that is

the section that you may be thinking about. Justice

Rehnquist, in Section 274(k).

said that even as to nuclear plant and waste regulation

That does not

include the question of how best to meet the states’

energy needs, whether this stuff is too costly and too

uncertain.
I think it’s interesting that the amicus

14
15

briefs of Connecticut and Oregon point out to this Court

16

that some nine months ago the Nuclear Regulatory

17

Commission repealed its financial qualification

18

requirements for nuclear power plant operators on the

ground that economics was a matter for the states to

worry about.

21

that nuclear plant shutdowns need not concern the

22

federal government since they are "not inimical to

23

public health and safety under the Atomic Energy Act."

24

Of course they're not inimical to health and

25

safety.

And the NRC in doing so specifically said

/

This is not a safety measure.

plain that the federal judiciary could not really grant

Congress repeatedly has been confronted with the request

to occupy this territory, to take it over, and its

rejection of that request, whatever we may usually make

of congressional inaction, is significant here because

the effect of a victory for the petitioners in this case

would be to transfer to the federal government the

Mr. Tribe, if your views were to

legislature?

16

here last year in the California bus amendment case.

17

You argued a legislative motivating case

MR. TRIBE:

Correct, Justice Rehnquist.

I

18

think that if our views were to prevail completely, then

19

the motive would be irrelevant, for this reason:

20

Section 271 of the Atomic Energy Act passed in 1954, as

21

long as a state exercises its historic, traditional

22

power -- and we think the power to say no to a proposed

23

electric generating facility falls in that category —

24

as long as it is not regulating the ongoing operation of

25

a nuclear facility, then there's no preemption at all

under

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

and motive doesn't matter.
It is only if we lose that claim and only if

3

we must rely on Section 274(k) -- that is, if the Court

4

treats what California has done as a regulation of the

5

operation of nuclear power plants or their wastes, only

6

then we must show that we come within 274(k), namely

7

that this is for purposes other than radiation.

8

And as to that I think thg.t the case that I

9

lost in the Crawford case really reflects the Court's

10

fairly general sense that second-guessing the motives of

lawmakers is a very difficult thing.

So that if we do have to rely

2

on Section 274(k), then I think it is very clear that

3

this is a properly motivated law.
One of the reasons I don’t want to have to

4
5

rely on 274(k) is that I think for institutional reasons

6

it makes a great deal more sense to create a rather

7

clean division between those kinds of activities that

8

states are preempted from and cannot engage in under the

9

Atomic Energy Act and those kinds that are somehow

10

suspect.

11

And it seems to me that a classic example of a

12

non problematic state decision is a state decision simply

13

not to have a particular form of power.

14

the states undertake to regulate in detail how that

15

power will be produced that there could be ongoing

16

conflicts between what the states think is appropriate

and what the federal regulators think is appropriate.

MB. TRIBE:

It's my view that the Atomic

Energy Act basically puts nuclear power on the shelf.

7

It says it's the exclusive responsibility of the NRC to

8

decide how those who buy it are to use it so that it

9

will be safe, but it is not a federal decision whether

10

it is appropriate, whether it is needed, whether it is

11

expensive, and indeed, if someone says we just don't

12

want to take the risks, all of the risks, taken as a

13

whole.

14

precludes that kind of action.

15

We believe nothing in the Atomic Energy Act

Of course, this case, it's important, I think,

16

to stress, does not require the Court to go nearly so

far, because the record in this case is unambiguous that

19

people from radiation hazards.

20

worrying about, the record makes clear, these wastes are

21

not at the moment targeted in some way for California.

22

There's nothing in the record suggesting that California

23

was afraid that the permanent waste depository would be

24

located there, that they might try to veto it and fail.

25

These wastes that we are

The concern was entirely what happens to the

48

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

consumers, the ratepayers, the energy users of

2

California if all of the optimism of the nuclear

3

industry and the federal regulators turns out to have

4

proved somewhat overblown, and if one actually has to

5

shut the plants down to protect the people.

6

at that point that California exercises the kind of

7

traditional judgment that we do not think involves a

8

regulation of nuclear power plants, and therefore

9

doesn't raise the motive issue.

10

And it is

Sow, arguably there’s a problem in that

11

respect with respect to one provision that I think is

1?

particularly unripe for resolution here; and that is the

13

provision dealing with full core onsite reserve

14

capacity, so that when a reactor is shut down for

15

repairs you don't have to ship its active core miles

16

away during the repair process but can store the core at

17

the site of the plant.

18

Now, one could say that that is an attempt by

19

the State of California to dictate some detail of

20

nuclear power plant construction, and that to prevail on

21

that claim we really do have to show that the motive

22

under 274(k) is other than radiation control.

23

Even conceding for the sake of argument that

24

in that case we would have to rely on 274(k), this is a

25

provision as to which all parties seem agreed, that the
49

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

reason has nothing to do with safety, the reason for

2

requiring that the core not have to get shipped miles

3

away.

The reason, quite simply -- and the Solicitor

4
5

General says so in his brief; petitioners say so in

6

their brief — the reason is that when you have to ship

7

the core away, you close the plant down longer, you have

8

a longer interruption, and it costs more.

that provision I think we prevail.

So even as to

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL

6

MR. MC DONOUGH:

Yes, if I may. Your Honor.

7

It is said here that the California

8

legislation does not reflect concern about safety, but

9

on its face it does not say that it does not reflect

10

that concern; and the fact of the matter is that these

11

statutes apply only to plants built in California.

12

Should a California utility decide to build a plant

13

outside California, these statues do not apply, and yet

14

the same problems of the clog in the — in the fuel

15

cycle and so forth would then — would then be

16

applicable.

17

these are not safety-related statutes.

So — and so we don’t concede at all that

18

Number two, Mr. Tribe has said that the states

19

traditionally have the right to decide what technologies

20

may be used within the state to generate electric

21

power.

22

That is true subject to this particular act.
We believe that the principle here, the

23

preemption principle here, is this:

that a state

24

statute is preempted which stands as an obstacle to the

25

accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and

1

objectives of Congress, as stated by Mr. Justice

2

Frankfurter back in Hines against Davidovitz.

3

The key to the decision of this case, we

4

think, is for the Court to make its own decision

5

respecting what can be derived from the course of

6

federal legislation and regulation of this activity over

7

the years.

8

the decision and has continued to make the decision as

9

recently as

What we find there is that Congress did make

1982 that there shall be a nuclear component

10

in the mix of any state if it possibly can be fitted

11

in.

12

the decision-making process as to whether it shall go in

13

into two components.

14

And then the Congress has really in effect divided

Certain matters are for the states to decide.

15

We’ve never challenged it.

Need, cost, whether it goes

16

into the rate base, how much goes into the rate base are

17

for the states to decide, condedely; but there are

18

questions that the federal government has decided it

19

will decide.

20

should -- you should not have a plant because of concern

21

about interim storage.

22

decide whether you shall not have a plant because of

23

concern about ultimate waste disposal.

24

government will decide how a plant should be designed,

25

how it should be constructed, and how it should be

It will decide the question of whether it

The federal government will

QUESTION*

2

Well, Mr. McDonough, that suggests

3

that the federal government has given nuclear power a

4

kind of preferred position over coal generation and

5

hydroelectric.
MS. HC D0N0UGH*

6

I think what it has done is

7

to — Congress, it seems to me, Mr. Justice Sehnguist,

8

very clearly said back in 1954 and has continued to say

9

we believe that the best interest of this country in the

10

long range will be served by having nuclear power in

11

this country, and we are going to do everything we can

12

do to bring it about, do everything we can do to

13

encourage the private sector to get in and stay in.

14

That's why they enacted the Price-Anderson Act.

15

why they — they have — they gave the technology to the

16

private sector.

That's

Congress has decided this is wisdom for this

17
18

country to have the nuclear option.

Now, that doesn't

19

mean that Congress has said the states must have it at

20

any cost, economic or otherwise.

21

will take the responsibility for design, for

22

construction, for operation.

23

responsibility for safety and the disposal of the spent

24

fuel.

25

things,

Congress has said we

We will take

And — and we -- we -- when we have decided those
they are decided for everybody, for all the

1

states, for the whole nation.

Congress takes that much

2

responsibility but does not purport to preempt the

3

states from making the kinds of judgments which Congress

4

is not trying to force it down anybody's throat but

5

trying to say we will take certain responsibility; you

6

take certain responsibility; together we will work it

7

out.

8

policy —

We will have nuclear power.

QUESTION;

9

That is the federal

Well, that certainly — that

10

certainly is forcing to a certain extent down somebody's

11

throat, isn't it -- together we will have

MR. MC DONOUGH;

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. MC DONOUGH*

15

(Laughter.)

16

QUESTION;

17

— Nuclear power.

who takes the responsibility for shutdowns?
MR. MC DONOUGH;

19

QUESTION;

21

Who takes the responsibility for

federal government.

23

QUESTION;

25

I beg your pardon?

shutdowns?

22

24

I think it's clear —

Who takes the responsibility for --

18

20

Yes.

Of the nuclear plant?

The

The NRC, the NRC, yes, sir.
In — in sort of an indemnity

agreement, or how do they do that?
MR. MC DONOUGH;

Well, you mean respecting
55

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

whether a particular plant should be shut down at a

2

particular point in time?
QUESTION;

3

And say there’s a very substantial

4

business interruption cost as a result of it.

5

the loss?
MR. MC DONOUGHs

6

7

Who bears

Well, I take it either the

shareholders or the ratepayers or both bear the cost.

8

QUESTION;

But not the federal government.

9

MR. MC D0N0UGH;

Not the federal government,

10

no.

The federal government has assumed a substantial

11

amount of responsibility, financial responsibility, for

12

the possibility of a nuclear incident, as you know,

13

under the Price-Anderson Act.

14

has manifested a continuing policy of wishing there to

15

be nuclear power plants and going out of its way in

16

every respect to see that eventuality comes -QUESTION;

17
18

The federal government

But it takes none of the investment

risk.
MR. MC D0N0UGH;

19

It doesn’t take the

20

investment risk, no, Your Honor.

21

risk.

22

invest more money than they would normally invest in a

23

plant.

24
25

It doesn't take that

But -- and it doesn't insist that the states

But with respect to the question of if there
is a risk of shutdown, it seems to me the federal

56

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

government has said that's a risk we must all assume.
QUESTION;

2

Well, Mr. McDonough, hasn't the

3

Ninth Circuit looked at the California law and said --

4

said as we understand this law, California has economic

5

concerns about nuclear power?
MR. MC D0N0UGH;

6

7

Circuit has.

9
10
11

I think that that, however —

QUESTION;

8

Yes, I believe the Ninth

Well, do we know more about the

California law than they do, or must we act like we do,
or what?
MR. MC D0N0UGH;

Well, I think that we have

12

brought the question here, and it seems to me now that

13

the case is here on writ of certiorari, the question now

14

is for this Court to decide whether it agrees with the

15

Ninth Circuit.

16

QUESTION;

About California law.

17

MR. MC D0N0UcH:

Well, yes, sir.

About the —

18

about the policy reflected in the California law.

19

it seems reasonable that the Court now would take its

20

own look at this and decide whether the case — whether

21

this law is safety-oriented or not.

22

reading of the statute in context would suggest that

23

that's exactly what it is.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

25

The case is submitted.

And

I think that a fair
