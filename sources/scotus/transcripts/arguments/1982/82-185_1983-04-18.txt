ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A. BARNICO, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF STATE PETITIONERS

7

8

Thank you.

MR. BARNICO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

9

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts appears here today

10

seeking reversal of orders entered by the United States District

11

Court for the District of Massachusetts on August 7, 1981.

12

thus seek the same result as the Union Petitioners in these

13

cases.

14

We

To accomplish that result, however, we bring a

15

different appeal and different arguments before the Court.

16

appeal from the unjustified suspension of a Massachusetts law

17

that requires that layoffs in public safety positions be made

18

in reverse order of seniority.

19

We

After briefly stating these cases, it is my intention

20

to argue that the District Court abused its discretion by

21

suspending that law where no previous orders or decrees entered

22

in these cases concerned layoffs and where entry of the orders

23

contradicted principles of federalism that govern the exercise

24

of the federal equity power.

25

The orders at issues were entered in on-going cases

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

with long judicial histories and state-wide application.

2

years ago the District Courts in these cases entered judgments

3

and found that state examination procedures for police and fire

4

positions unintentionally, and I repeat, unintentionally violated

5

the rights of the plaintiffs.

6

Those orders required a new examination and also required

7

preferential certification of minorities to local cities and

8

towns.

9

Ten

Remedial orders were entered.

As a result of the preferential certifications, the

10

percentage of minorities in Massachusetts city and town police and fi'

11

forces increased substantially.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Barnico, were those original orders

13

entered of indefinite duration?

14

MR. BARNICO:

15
16
17
18

The orders that were entered in August

of 1981, Your Honor, or the —
QUESTION:

No, the original — sometime in the '70's.

I don't know when it was.
MR. BARNICO:

The subsequent decrees entered shortly

19

after those original findings to provide for the remedial phase

20

of the cases applied to the cities and towns until the percentages

21

of minorities reach a percentage commensurate with the percentage

22

in the community.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. BARNICO:

25

And, has that percentage yet been reached?
Not in Boston, Your Honor, but in many

communities, yes.
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

QUESTION:

So, as far as Boston is concerned, the

2

decree entered in the '70's still has considerable prospective

3

effect?

4

MR. BARNICO:

5

In the summer of 1981, Boston proposed layoffs in its

Yes, Your Honor.

6

police and fire departments.

7

plaintiffs styled a motion to modify prior remedial orders.

8
9

QUESTION:

The District Court granted what

Should the order that we are reviewing here

today, having to do with the layoffs, be interpreted as having

10

a permanent effect in your view?

11

MR. BARNICO:

12

Our view — That is correct, Your Honor.

Our view is by its terms it has permanent application.

13

That order of August 7, 1981 directed city and state

14

officials to ignore the provisions of the state seniority

15

statute, never challenged and never at issue —

16

QUESTION:

Hasn't there been some recent legislation

17

requiring the reinstatement of all those firemen and policemen

18

who were laid off?

19

20

MR. BARNICO:
passed in June of 1982.

21

22

Yes, Your Honor, that legislation was

QUESTION:

Well, then, what kind of case have we got

here?

23

MR. BARNICO:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. BARNICO:

You have a live case here, Your Honor.

How?
These cases —
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

QUESTION:

Everyone who was aggrieved has now been

2

reinstated, hasn't he?

3

MR. BARNICO:

4

QUESTION:

5

The state is aggrieved and —

Everyone who has been aggrieved, every

fireman and police officer has been reinstated, has he not?

6

MR. BARNICO:

The firefighters and police officers laid

7

off in the summer of 1981 were reinstated by the terms of that

8

legislation, that is correct.

9

QUESTION:

10

do we have here?

11

I ask you again then, what kind of a case

Do we have any?

MR. BARNICO:

We have a live case here, Your Honor,

12

because the state defendants have been parties to this case for

13

over ten years, are still subject to the outstanding terms of

14

those orders.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. BARNICO:

17

QUESTION::

18

Do you mean on back pay?
Excuse me?

Do you mean by reason of back pay that

is paid to these people?

19

MR. BARNICO:

No, Your Honor.

Mr. McMahon could speak

20

to the permanent effect of the orders on those back-pay claims.

21

Since I represent the state defendants, I rely on the outstanding

22

effect of the orders on the state officials.

23

QUESTION:

What orders are you talking about,

24

reinstatement and seniority or what?

25

about?

What orders are you talking

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. BARNICO:

The orders of August 7, 1981, by their

2

terms apply to any program for reduction in force.

3

apply currently to the administrative appeals brought by the

4

terminated officers that are now pending before the Civil

5

Service Commission.

They also

6

In addition, Your Honor, we have a third argument and

7

that is simply that these cases continue in the District Court.

8

We are still subject to the underlying judgments of these cases.

9

And, when we return from this case, the cases that I mentioned

10

before live with on-going —

11

QUESTION:

12

The parties have had to comply with the

reduction-in-force orders.

13

MR. BARNICO:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

I am not sure what you mean by that.

Well, the issue in the case was how were

they going to discharge people when they reduced force?
MR. BARNICO:

That is correct.

Boston proposed layoffs

17

and the issue was whether the seniority statute of Massachusetts

18

should govern the layoffs last time and —

19

20
21

QUESTION:

And the orders were that they wouldn't

govern them.
MR. BARNICO:

The orders said that the statute would

22

be ignored and percentages — any program of reduction in force

23

should be maintained.

24
25

QUESTION:

And the police and fire department have been

complying with those?

MR. BARNICO:

QUESTION:

3

MR. BARNICO:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. BARNICO:

6

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And they must continue to comply —
Absolutely.

Unless the orders are set aside?
That is correct, Your Honor.

Well, I don't follow that.

If the officers,

7

whether firemen or policemen, affected have, by the latest

8

legislation, been ordered reinstated and have, in fact, been

9

reinstated, what do the authorities have to comply with?

10

They

are reinstated now.

11

MR. BARNICO:

As I said, Your Honor, there is a current

12

effect on the Civil Service Commission's adjudication of their

13

appeals.

14
15

QUESTION:

Well, what is left of their appeals?

Their

appeals don't concern reinstatement, do they?

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. BARNICO:

18

QUESTION:

And seniority.

19

QUESTION:

Seniority.

20

QUESTION:

Those issues are not here in this case.

21

QUESTION:

But, they are not moot, are they?

22

MR. BARNICO:

23

They are trying to get back pay.
That is right.

Back pay is not an issue in this case, no,

Your Honor.

24

QUESTION:

But neither is seniority.

25

QUESTION:

There is a controversy, I take it, that goes

on under the decree.
MR. BARNICO:
that I gave earlier.
QUESTION:

The controversy continues for those reasons
That is our position.

And the reinstatement included too with

5

full seniority, isn't it?

6

reinstated with full seniority, is that not right?

7

MR. BARNICO:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. BARNICO:

10

11
12

QUESTION:

Everybody who was discharged has been

No, Your Honor.

Oh, isn't it?
Your Honor, these cases —

Well, if not, what?

The reinstatement is

with what seniority?
MR. BARNICO:

Seniority only to the time of determination.

13

I think Mr. McMahon could —

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. BARNICO:

You don't seem to be too sure of that.
Well, Mr. McMahon, I think, could

16

clarify that position, but the back pay issue still remains so

17

that when Justice Stevens suggested that all issues were taken

18

care by the reinstatement, I add that the back pay question

19

still remains.

20

QUESTION:

I assume, since you represent the state,

21

your denying that they are entitled to back pay and he contends

22

they are entitled to back pay.

23
24
25

MR. BARNICO:

The state is an adjudicator actually,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Oh, I see.

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

MR. BARNICO:

The Commission will decide whether the

city will actually pay the back pay.

3

These cases pose important --

4

QUESTION:

The city under the — or rather the Civil

5

Service Commission under the modification of 1981 is subject to

6

an express paragraph, is it not, of the modification limiting the

7

authority of the Civil Service Commission?

8
9
10

MR. BARNICO:

Yes, Your Honor, and that continuing

effect keeps this case alive before this Court.
QUESTION:

The respondents contended, and some copy of

11

a Civil Service Commission decision is attached, to indicated that

12

our decision here will have no effect on the back pay and that is

13

being resolved on different grounds.

14

MR. BARNICO:

But, currently, Your Honor, the Civil

15

Service Commission is prevented from even considering the

16

question of seniority in the back pay and termination appeals.

17

We are asking, as the state adjudicator, to be free from an order

18

which currently prohibits us from making an inquiry that we are

19

bound to make under the state law.

20

QUESTION:

Yes, but Mr. Barnico, if we were to con­

21

clude that the case is moot because of these reinstatements, I

22

take it we would vacate all those orders, wouldn't we?

23

MR. BARNICO:

But, you would have to conclude that

24

there is no continuing and permanent effect on the state

25

petitioners before you vacate these orders, vacate this case and
10

2

so-called once you determine that there is no current and no

3

permanent effect on the state officials.

4

course, that there is.

5

6

QUESTION:

You can only invoke Munsingwear procedure

And, we argue, of

Well, I take it we would have to vacate

the entire decree if it is moot, wouldn't we?

7

MR. BARNICO:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. BARNICO:

Absolutely.

Including the 1970 portion.
And that procedure that has been used

10

in the past has often been used to vacate the underlying judgments

11

with instructions to dismiss which is far different than here.

12

In this case, you will not hear plaintiffs' respondents ask the

13

Court to vacate the underlying judgments because those continue

14

and they have orders which effect examinations and certifications

15

in the future.

16
17
18

My time is expiring but my case is not, I assure you.
(Laughter)
MR. BARNICO:

Previous school desegregation and

employment discrimination cases decided by this Court have

required states to address particular instances of racial

21

discrimination.

23

redress specific wrongs and vindicated entitlements.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN MC MAHON, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNION PETITIONERS

3

MR. MC MAHON:

4

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it

please the Court:
Before proceeding to my view of the issue, if I could

5

6

respond to some of the questions that had been posed with respect

7

to the seniority remedy.

8

the officers had been laid off for fiscal reasons, they did

9

regain all their seniority back to date of permanent appointment.

In effect, upon reinstatement, because

10

In that case, the seniority issue, in terms of relief that they

11

are presently seeking before the state agency, dropped out of

12

the case.
There is a very serious back pay issue that is involved

13
14

and it is one which the Civil Service Commission

15

rule upon.

is

asked to

16

As long as the District Court's August 7, 1981 order

17

does exist, the Civil Service Commission cannot rule upon that

18

order.

19

I would submit to you as a matter of equities as to

20

who should bear the particular loss,the City of Boston or the

21

laid-off officers if, in fact, the seniority suppression was not

22

valid, that should be an issue left best to the Civil Service

23

Commission of Massachusetts.

24

There are a variety of Civil Service appeals which

25

have come up, including a police officer, superior officer's
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

appeal, which, I believe, Justice O'Connor referenced in her

2

question and that order, if I recall it, was based on the fact

3

that the City of Boston had used a political manipulation to

4

lay off a small number of police officers in another group not

5

represented by the union before you today.

6

In effect, I think the Civil Service Commission was

7

stating that they found that there was a political discrimination

8

involved in that order.

9

if I have not quoted it correctly, but my recollection is that

I have not looked at it and I apologize

10

it was based on a different series of proofs than would be

11

involved in this case.

12

If I could return to my argument, the unions submit

13

that the issue before you is whether a federal court in an

14

employment discrimination case can grant increased, competitive

15

job security to junior minority firefighters who were not, who

16

were not victims of past acts of discrimination by suppressing

17

a bona fide seniority statute requiring seniority layoffs to

18

the detriment of senior non-minority firefighters who were then

19

terminated.

20

I would submit that this judicial override should be

21

reversed on statutory grounds.

22

not persuasive, this judicial override should fail for reasons

23

found in the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.

24
25

If the statutory grounds are

I would submit to you that in framing relief the

enacted in Section 703 (h) of Title VII, protecting and conserving

earned seniority rights.

13

extends an immunity to routine applications of seniority systems

14

irrespective of disparate impacts.

15

QUESTION:

I submit to you that that statute

Mr. McMahon, what is your theory on how

16

703(h) gets into this case since the action wasn't brought under

17

Title VII?

18

MR. MC MAHON:

Your Honor, there were two actions.

19

In the police case, the police decision had been adjudicated

20

prior to the effective date of Title VII's application to

21

municipalities and local governments.

22

the plaintiffs', private plaintiffs' complaint originally

23

asserted only violations of the Fourteenth Amendment in Sections

24

1981 and 1983.

25

The United States filed a complaint repeating those same grounds

In the firefighter case,

That complaint was filed in November of 1972.

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

and asserting a Title VII ground in February of 1973.

2

The focus in both complaints was upon examinations

3

conducted no later than August 1971 and on recruitment techniques.

4

It may be that one could argue that there was never a Title VII

5

violation ever present in these cases.

6

that the record would also show that in April of 1972 a Boston

7

eligibility list was established from the August 1971 exam and

8

some 86 non-minority firefighter appointments were made prior

9

to the filing of the plaintiffs' complaint.

However, I have to note

Thereafter, the

10

state agencies voluntarily ceased using that list so that there

11

may be a Title VII connection in that respect, but the parties

12

never focused on it in litigation and the theories in both cases,

13

as they were stated by the District Court, were on the Fourteenth

14

Amendment and on the Constitution, not Title VII.

15

But, even if there is a constitutional basis to this

16

case, I would conclude that the Section 1988 of 42 US Code

17

would require a District Court to shape relief in an employment

18

case based on constitutional grounds according to other federal

19

law.

Such other federal law should be Section 703(h).

20

You are really redressing, in the constitutional sense,

21

individual violations and only individual rights can be violated.

22

I think then that you would use the same sort of constructive

23

seniority approach that this Court has approved in Franks and

24

approved again in Teamsters and has commented on several times,

25

most recently in Ford Motor Company and in Zipes, in order to
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2
3
4

extend rightful place relief.
So, even under the Constitution or Title VII, I think
you come to the same result, Your Honor.
In this case, the District Court did establish four

5

priority pools.

6

of all persons who took the August 1971 or earlier examination

the Group C.

The first priority pool, the Group A, consisted

The second pool, with which we are concerned, is
That consisted of all non-minority persons who

could not qualify for admission into Groups A but who had passed
a new examination.

I would submit that those persons who were

Group C were not victims of any discrimination, any act of
discrimination, and that the conferral of a random benefit upon
them without establishing any victim identification was not only
inconsistent with this Court's decision in Teamsters, but, indeed,
it bears upon the claim that the disadvantaged senior firefighters
have that their rights were invaded by the order in the sense
that they lost an equal protection component that the possessed.
May I add that the particular order benefit only
persons who were not victims of racial discrimination or
identified as victims of racial discrimination; that a use of a
racial classification should only be approved, if it ever can
be approved, when it is used as a remedy for a person who is a
victim of past identified discrimination.
In this case, that surely was not the use.

Instead,

and I think both the District Court and the Court of Appeals'
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

opinions reflect this fact.

2

At the August 30 — I am sorry, the July 30, 1981

3

hearing before the District Court, and if I could paraphrase the

4

District Court, they said that the only issue before the house

5

is an issue of numbers, whether we were going to keep a certain

6

number, whether we were going to decrease a certain number or

7

whether we were going to increase a certain number.

8

arguments on all the other issues.

on percentages.

That was the focus.

It was

purpose of the orders was to maintain a semblance of racial

balance.

I would submit to you that a purpose in that direction

impact of the orders in terms of any constitutional justification

16

for the orders.

for a moment, it actually fell on 123 non-minority firefighters,

20

yet they are indistinguishable in terms of advantage of obtaining

21

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. DITTMAR, ESQ.

4

6

Thank you very much.

Because the Court voiced almost with one voice a
concern about mootness, I would like to address that issue
briefly.

It is a threshold issue.

As the suggestion of mootness,

which we incorporated in our brief in the merits, indicates we
view this case to be moot.
A Massachusetts' Act of 1982, Chapter 190 which was
passed approximately one month after the Court of Appeals
affirmed the District Court decision, mandates that all officers
in both departments who were discharged during the reduction-in­
force program in 1981 be rehired.

It also, modifying what would

otherwise be standard principles of Civil Service law, specifies
that all of these individuals who were laid off and then rehired
have lifetime job security from layoffs for lack of funds or
reduction-in-force programs.
In addition, the City of Boston has begun rehiring
additional officers over the last approximately nine months
under mandates also coming from that same statute to raise and
maintain levels of staffing in the two departments.
QUESTION:

You said "rehiring."
19

Do you mean —

MR. DITTMAR:

2

The case, we believe, is moot.

3

QUESTION:

4

Additional hiring.

I did mispeak.

While you are there, what did they do about

the back pay of these men who were laid off?

5

MR. DITTMAR:

The back pay is now, to my understanding,

6

in some instances pending before the Civil Service Commission.

7

The pendancy of that claim, however, does not make this controversy

8

before

that back-pay claim are not before this Court.

Court still a live controversy.

The parties to
Indeed, on our

10

side of defense in this Court we have no complaint whatsoever

QUESTION:

14
15

MR. DITTMAR:

The state could represent the Civil

Service Commissioners but they sit as an adjudicator party.

16
17

Mr. Dittmar, wouldn't you say that the

QUESTION:

But, they are subject to paragraph four

of Judge Caffrey's decree, are they not?

18

MR. DITTMAR:

Paragraph four of Judge Caffrey's decree

has, for all intents and purposes, has expired, because there

20

are no longer any terminations or layoffs with which the Civil

21

Service officials could in any way interfere by any action that

22

they take.

23

Moreover, Your Honor, this Court nor the lower court

24

on any remand following any action on the merits can issue no

25

relief that has any bearing upon that back-pay claim.

Wouldn't the

Wouldn't the Civil Service Commission have a pretty

MR. DITTMAR:

I don't see how the Civil Service

Commission could deny a back-pay claim because an order which

8

was valid and not reversed nor vacated at the time it was in

9

effect is subsequently reversed on appeal.

I believe, if

10

anything in terms of alleviating what might be perceived as a

11

hinderance on the part of the Civil Service Commission,

12

a vacation for mootness grants them greater freedom, because that

13

vacates the order.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Dittmar, do you know of any case

15

similar to this where there has been an underlying controversy

16

that is the subject of a basic decree and then there is a

17

modification of the decree and we have simply said, well, this

18

branch of the case is moot but the underlying controversy

19

isn't?

MR. DITTMAR:

QUESTION:

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. DITTMAR:

2

QUESTION:

Sure.

You are really asking us to go into kind of

3

a new departure, aren't you, where the basic underlying case is

4

not moot, to simply prune off a little branch of it and say,

5

because it is moot, the whole thing is vacated?

6

MR. DITTMAR:

No, quite the contrary.

The basic

7

underlying controversy is moot and my brethern are asking to

8

have you — because they say there is a little branch off to the

9

side that is still alive keeps the underlying controversy alive.

10

QUESTION: Yes, but the underlying controversy is whether

11

there should be a minority quota requirement in the Boston

12

policy and fire systems, isn't there?

13

MR. DITTMAR:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

That has been resolved by the statute.

Well, that has been resolved by the District

Court decree in the '70's^
MR. DITTMAR:

Well, as between — I am sorry, in the

17

'70's, no, not in the '70's.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. DITTMAR:

Well, when was the original decree entered?
The original decrees, the original decrees

20

were in the early '70's, that is true, but those decrees

21

terminate by their own terms once any hiring authority achieves

22

a percentage representation of firefighters or police officers.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Opposing counsel said that that decree had

not terminated so far as the City of Boston was concerned.
MR. DITTMAR:

That is correct, but that decree is not

None of the parties to this proceeding have

If that is a live controversy, any modifi­

cation of it is a live controvery, isn't it?

No, I don't believe so, Your Honor.

The

only controversy that is here before this Court is whether the

modification was proper.

8

10

has brought us all before the Court here a live controversy.
QUESTION:

12

The fact that there is an underlying

Well, but, we decide mootness in terms of

cases or controversies, not in terms of orders.
MR. DITTMAR:

13

You decide it in terms of — That is true.

14

There is — The Court has — The lower court has continuing

Your Honor, it is plainly not a permanent order.

that took place in the summer of 1981.

permanent as is now contended, it surely would have been

challenged on the merits as a matter of substantive and remedial

I believe on the face of the order,
It was argued

If it were, indeed, a

law in the lower court and in the Court of Appeals under the

teachings of this Court in the Swann, Charlotte, Mecklenberg

case and under the teaching of this Court in the Pasadena

13

Board of Education-Spangler case and it was never raised.

14

was never any attack on the invalidity of the order as a matter

15

of substantive law, because it set a permanent racial quota,

16

a permanent racial maintenance level, until that issue was

17

raised to defeat the suggestion of mootness in this Court.

18

There

And, if you look at the terms of the order, the

19

language, any reduction-in-force program is plainly in there

20

in order to avoid any problems of evasion by the manner in which

21

in the summer of 1981 on the factual record before the Court

22

be programmed or structured in a way that would avoid the

23

prohibition of the District Court's order.

9
10

Was it consistent with the Court's order?

QUESTION:

Well, it ordered reinstatement of the very

people that the Court thought should have been laid off.

13

MR. DITTMAR:

No, no.

The Court simply ordered that

14

during the reduction-in-force program the level of minority

15

representation obtained at the outset of that program be maintained

16

The city went ahead with a reduction-in-force program, laid off

17

a certain number of minority and a certain number of non-minority

18

officers and then completed its program.

19

specified that everyone who had been laid off should be rehired

20

and that additional staffing minimums be maintained and that

21

would simply bring the level of officers back to where they were

22

before we all started plus a little bit more.

QUESTION:

May I ask just one question to be sure I

8

MR. DITTMAR:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Is it your position that you would be just

10

as content to have the District Judge's order of August 7, 1981

vacated?

12

MR. DITTMAR:

Well, I suppose having put the suggestion

13

of mootness into the brief, I would have to say, yes, we are just

14

as content.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. DITTMAR:

I just wanted to be sure.
I think that is a matter of responsibility

17

to the Court in laying out the full dimensions of the present

18

circumstances to the Court.

19

QUESTION:

Well, you made the suggestion contemplating

20

that if the suggestion were favorably received that is exactly

21

what would happen.

22

MR. DITTMAR:

That is correct, Your Honor.

The only thing that is before the Court is the challenge

by the certiorari petitioners to the relief embodied in the

12

expressly disclaimed any challenge either to the original judgment

13

or to the remedial measures that were in place prior to August

14

of 1981.

15

QUESTION:

Indeed, all parties to this case expressly,

Do you think it would have been improper in

16

the original decree for the District Judge to have included

17

provisions dealing with the contingency of possible reductions

in force?

19

MR. DITTMAR:

Well, Your Honor, I don't believe that

20

it would have been beyond the Court's power to do so, but I

21

believe that it would not have been a sound exercise in discretion

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't he have power today to keep in

23

effect a portion of the decree which would deal with that

24

contingency even if we can't see it immediately before us?

25

MR. DITTMAR:

Because I think that in exercising
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

discretion for remedial purposes to remedy the exclusion of

2

minorities from public service a court should be very careful

3

to consider the actual circumstances obtaining before it, to

4

consider what extent of relief has been accorded under the

5

on-going remedial program which is incomplete, how far along the

6

remedy is, the extent of the imposition or the frustration of

7

the remedy, which an otherwise proposed governmental action

8

would work, the burden that any particular order would place

9

upon third-party employees, and factors of that sort.

10

I don't believe that that kind of set of considerations

11

ought to be considered in the abstract and ought to be laid down

12

in advance.

13

precisely the fashion in which the District Court — Chief Judge

QUESTION:

MR. DITTMAR:

If the case is not moot, I would like to

The order that is under review on the merits is an

20

order that arises out of a case in which, through the operation

21

of Massachusetts Civil Service practices, minorities had been

22

unconstitutionally excluded historically from the police and

23

fire departments of the City of Boston.

24

both of these cases in the early 1970's adjudicated that

3

past practices have brought about.

4

A remedial program was put in place in order to

The city and the state Civil Service officials were

5

bound to participate in that remedial program.

6

of the Court to remedy this condition which the discrimination

7

had accomplished and ultimately they entered into consent orders

8

with respect to both of the cases.

9

It was an order

The program was on-going when, in the summer of 1981,

10

the City of Boston proposed and started implementing a program

11

such that in six weeks approximately one-half of all Black and

12

Hispanic firemen in the City of Boston and one-half of all Black

13

and Hispanic police officers were going to be laid off.

14

Another way of putting it is approximately one-half

15

of all of the officers in both departments who had been hired

16

under the remedial phase yet to be completed ordered by the

17

Court were going to be laid off.

18

The Court's order came in that context and the Court's

19

order said you may not reduce the present percentage representa­

20

tion levels if you pursue this reduction-in-force program which

21

has been placed before me with statistics indicating its scope

22

and impact.

23

I believe the order was proper and the issue before

24

the Court on the merits is whether the District Court had the

25

power to issue such an order to maintain and protect and promote
29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

the original purposes of its remedial orders going back to the

2

original adjudications of liability and whether, in this

3

particular instance on the matters and record before the Court,

4

there was a sound and proper exercise of discretion.

5

the answer to both questions is the Court had its power, had

6

the power and the Court properly exercised discretion.

7

I believe

My starting point is that having adjudicated dis­

8

criminatory exclusion of minorities from a public governmental

9

agency, in this case public services agencies, the Court has

10

the power to remedy the effects, the exclusion that the past

11

practices has brought about.

12

QUESTION:

Could I ask you what seniority did the

13

Blacks have or the minorities have when they were hired pursuant

14

to the Court's order?

Did they just start out from scratch?

15

MR. DITTMAR:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

They started out from scratch, Your Honor.

So, they didn't — There was no attempt

made to jump them over anybody else?
MR. DITTMAR:

Two things, Your Honor.

One, there was

19

no attempt made to jump them up over anyone else with a kind of

20

rightful place, retroactive seniority that the Court has spoken

21

about in several cases.

22

was made to identify, to give notice to or bring before the

23

Court and adjudicate who they were out there who had been

24

deterred by years and years of exclusion of minorities.

25

QUESTION:

And, equally significant, no attempt

So, at the time — So, when the layoffs
30

started, the minorities that had been hired were certainly junior

2

to a lot of other people?

3

MR. DITTMAR:.

QUESTION:

9

And junior to a lot of people who were then

discharged pursuant to the order?

6
7

That is correct.

MR. DITTMAR:

That is correct, Your Honor.

That is

correct.
It was a proper form of relief, however, in large part
because what we had had in the past is we had had the exclusion

10

of minorities from the police and fire departments and the

11

original remedies, the original remedies were the predicate

12

for the modification.

13

a flexible compromise between the interests of those who had

14

been discriminated against, those who were also already in these

15

various forces and who would be jumped over at the time, and

16

the interests of the municipal authorities in managing, as much

17

as possible in the ordinary fashion, their hiring and operations

18

of their departments.

19

The original remedies had been themselves

When the layoffs came in 1981, however, because there

20

had been no wholesale attempt to locate and give a remedy to

21

all of the victims of discrimination originally or even to

22

give a full rightful place, retroactive seniority remedy to

23

those who were clearly identified at the outset, the Court once

24

again, I believe, used flexibility to —

The burden of the layoff program which was instituted by the

The Court did not take away from the City of Boston or the

state civil service officials for that matter their powers and

prerogatives to make the decisions that they felt were appropriate,,

MR. DITTMAR:

The purpose of that provision, Your Honor,

was to insure that as a matter of state civil service law, if

there was compliance by the city with the order, the Civil

as to require the layoffs of minorities in contravention of the

essence only one provision and that was that during that program,

and only during that program, minority percentages be maintained.

The Court's order was simply — has as it

insure that that not be sabotaged, that is all.

matter, Your Honor, that provision, in my opinion, has no

And, for that

10

continuing validity, no continuing vitality, I am sorry, I

11

should say.

12

Now, one other point that is raised by the unions

13

is that the burden of the Court's order falls on third parties.

14

That is true.

15

established that where the highest national priority of remedying

16

race discrimination, and in this case we have virtually, as I

17

have said, exclusion of minorities from the police and fire

departments of the City of Boston.

parties to share that burden.

I have pointed out.

was careful to preserve as much as possible the provisions of

of the very kind of thing which happened which was the political

solution to these problems which was frustrated until the day

In short, the extent of burden that the order places
on others is within the permissible scope of the District Court

10

and the District Court took care not to step any further than it

11

had to.

12

I would like to just conclude by pointing out that

13

the efforts in this country through legal measures to eradicate

14

several hundreds years of race discrimination are not many years

15

old, barely 25 years, and one of the hallmarks of what this

16

Court has done by way of giving direction to the lower courts

17

is to vest the lower courts with flexibility to deal with the

18

very difficult circumstances, practical, political, and economic,

19

that they face.

20

I believe that the District Court and the Court of

21

Appeals in this case exercised that kind of flexibility wisely

22

and I urge the Court to affirm and not deprive the lower courts

23

of the needed flexibility to meet this pressing national challenge.

24

Thank you.
