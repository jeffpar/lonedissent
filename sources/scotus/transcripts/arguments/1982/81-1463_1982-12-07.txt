ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. DePUE, Esq.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

7

ME. DePUE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE:

9

MB. DePUE:

Mr. DePue.

This case presents the question

10

whether a federal appellate court may summarily reverse

11

a conviction because of the prosecutor's improper

12

comment on the defendant's failure to present evidence,

13

without first making an assessment for prejudice under

14

the constitutional harmless error standard.

15

Briefly summarized, the government's evidence

16

showed that during the early morning of October 11th,

17

1979, three teenaqed qirls and a male companion were

18

driving in the vicinity of East St. Louis, Illinois,

19

when their car was forced off the road by five men

20

driving a turquoise Cadillac.

21

After both cars had come to a halt, the girls

22

were pulled from their car.

One of them was raped.

The

23

men then forced them into the Cadillac, drove them

24

across the interstate boundary into St. Louis, Missouri,

25

where they repeated their sexual assaults at three

different locations.
Following the girls*

release, one of them led

the police to the apartment where she had been taken by

4

her abductors.

5

Stewart and found items of clothing belonging to the

6

victims.

7

learned that it was registered to respondent Williams,

8

and found Williams* latent prints on the car from which

9

the girls had been taken.

10

There,

the officers arrested respondent

They also located the turguoise Cadillac,

These developments also resulted in the

11

apprehension of the remaining respondents, each of whom

12

was identified by at least one of the victims during a

13

lineup the following morning.

14

for rape and a Kann Act violation, each of the victims

15

again identified each respondent as a participant in the

16

abductions.

17

At their ensuing trial

The defense did not put on the defendants

18

themselves as witnesses.

Instead, their defense was

19

calculated to discredit the girls, their credibility and

20

the accuracy of their identifications by reference to

21

the girls* activities just before and just after the

22

abductions took place.

23

testimony from the girls during cross examination that

24

they had been out drinking, in violation of

25

parentally-imposed curfews and that they’d gotten lost

For example, they elicited

It bears. Justice Rehnguist, on

8

the argument that we will see that the prosecutor

presented subsequently, because we maintain it was a

10

direct reference to what the defendants were actually

doing.
In addition, respondents presented witnesses

12

13

of their own who testified that just before and just

14

after the alleged abductions, the physical appearances

15

of respondents were not at all correspondent with those

16

as described by the victims.

17

The prosecutor in his summation first

18

discussed the posture of the government's case.

turned to respondents' case and he made the following

California.

failure to

Although the court acknowledged that the

6

7

crimes were heinous and that the evidence of guilt was

8

clear, it refused to assess for prejudice under the

9

constitutional harmless error standard.

Instead, after

10

alluding to the fact that prosecutors in the Seventh

11

Circuit had continuously disregarded admonitions not to

12

make arguments that implicated Fifth Amendment rights,

13

they stated that to their view, application of the

14

constitutional harmless error standard would

15

impermissibly compromise the defendants* Fifth Amendment

16

rights.
It's the government’s position that this

17
18

reasoning is in direct violation of this Court's

19

decision in Chapman versus California, violates the

20

federal harmless error statute and contravenes broader

21

rules regarding the formulation of remedies in criminal

22

cases.

23

QUESTION;

Mr. DePue, are you in a position to

24

state why the government didn't raise the question here

25

of whether or not this comment was, in fact, a violation

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

of Griffin?

If you’re not, feel free to say you’re not.

MR. DePUE;

2

Justice Pehnguist, we didn't seek

3

to address — we didn’t feel we needed to address that

4

in our brief, although we do not concede that it was, in

5

fact, a violation of Griffin.

6

was a cert worthy issue, and therefore, we didn't raise

7

it.

QUESTION;

We didn't feel that that

Well, we have to assume that it was

a Griffin type error for purposes of resolving this case.

certainly do.

QUESTION;

ME. DePUE;

(laughter.)

16

QUESTION;

Well, we don’t have to.
No, Your Honor.

The way you phrased the question

17

presented, you assume it is.

18

closing argument that constitutes improper comment upon

19

the defendant’s failure to testify justifies reversal.

20

So you are assuming —

21

22
23

MR. DePUE;
that it is.

You say whether the

Yes, Justice Stevens, we assume

We, however, do not concede that it is.

QUESTION;

Well, are there other ways than

24

testifying that they could have challenged this?

In

25

other words, by establishing that they were in New York

Burger.

And as a matter of fact, they presented

4

witnesses of their own who said that they saw these

5

people shortly after midnight and approximately at 6;00

6

o'clock in the morning.

7

respondents’ mothers, respondent Stevens' mother

8

actually saw Stevens and the girls and testified that to

9

her observation, everything that was going on was

And in addition to this, one of

10

consensual.

So in fact, these were challenged to a

11

certain extant, and there were people who could have

12

testified to the contrary.

13

Now, of course, in Chapman versus California,

14

a state prosecutor, relying on a provision of the state

15

constitution, directly and repeatedly commented on the

16

defendant's failure to testify and the inferences of

17

guilt that could be extracted from that.

18

judge followed suit in his instructions to the jury.

19

The trial

Following that trial, however, this Court in

20

Griffin versus California held that the provision of the

21

California Constitution upon which he had relied was

22

unconstitutional.

23

When Chapman's own case came before this

24

Court, Chapman held, argued that all errors of a

25

constitutional magnitude, and Griffin errors in

proposition.
QUESTION;

3

Mr. DePue, if this Court had

4

accepted the argument in Chapman against California, I

5

assume they pretty much would have emptied the

6

California jails, wouldn't they, because that had been

7

the standard practice in California before Griffin was

8

decided.

9

MR. DE PUE:

10

QUESTION;

11

MR. DE PUE;

Yes, Justice Stevens.
Yes.
Now, when the case came before

12

this Court, the Court rejected that argument, and held

13

that Griffin violations, just like any other

14

non-constitutional violations, could be deemed harmless

15

and thus not a basis for reversal.

16

Chapman's conviction, but only after first satisfying

17

itself that given the less than overwhelming posture of

18

the evidence, it could not be satisfied beyond a

19

reasonable doubt that the prosecutor's pointed and

20

repeated allusions to the defendant's failure to testify

21

was not harmless.

22

It reversed

In the wake of Chapman, and prior to the

23

decision of the court below, this Court and the courts

24

of appeals have virtually without exception held that

25

the constitutional harmless error standard applies to

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

violations of Griffin.

They have therefore reversed

2

convictions only when after canvassing the evidence in

3

its totality, looking at the argument in its proper

4

context, they couldn't be satisfied that it didn't

5

contribute to the conviction.
This approach, we maintain, is not only

6
7

mandated by the Chapman decision itself, but by broader

8

principles of revenue recently articulated by this

9

Court.

In United States versus Korrison, the Third

10

Circuit dismissed an indictment because a government

11

agent had made improper remarks to the defense counsel

12

about the competency of her own lawyer, to the defendant

13

about the competency of her own lawyer.

14

however, reversed, finding that dismissal was

15

unwarranted absent any evidence that the alleged Sixth

16

Amendment violation could have prejudiced the defendant

17

and the proceedings in any way.

18

This Court,

In doing so, the Court admonished the courts

19

of appeals that after identifying a constitutional

20

error, the proper approach was to assess the damage, and

21

to tailor a remedy that was commensurate to the injury

22

received as a result of that violation, and then a

23

broader approach would impermissibly infringe upon other

24

legitimate interests.

25

violation -- of a Griffin violation, this means that

In the context of a Chapman

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

once the court has determined that the violation

2

occurred, it has got to look at the amount of prejudice

3

that resulted in determining whether other events at

4

trial offset it.

It cannot summarily reverse.

Of course, harmless error principles are not

5
6

simply a matter of judicial self-restraint.

The federal

7

harmless error statute and Rule 52(a) of the federal

8

rules of criminal procedure both expressly prohibit a

9

court of appeals from reversing a conviction on the

10

basis of errors or defects that do not substantially

11

affect the nature of the proceedings.
Respondent argues, however, that the harmless

12

13

error statute and Rule 52(a) are inapplicable to this

14

case because the error involved is of a constitutional

15

magnitude.

16

this reasoning in Chapman itself.

17

accepted the policy embodied by the federal harmless

18

error statute which was to require an assessment of

19

prejudice in all cases without regard to whether the

20

error was of a constitutional or non-constitutional

21

magnitude.

22

This Court has, however, sguarely rejected
There, the Court

Respondent’s principal contention, however, is

23

that the Court in the exercise of its supervisory power

24

was free to disregard the Chapman standard and fashion a

25

remedy of its own as a prophylatic measure because of

13

the alleged repeated violations of the Griffin standard

12

But be that as it may, there are three reasons

13

why the Seventh Circuit could not adopt a reversal per

14

se rule in the exercise of its supervisory power.

15

the first place, as Justice Frankfurter stated in

16

Sherman versus United States long aoo, the supervisory

power entails the formulation of standards for the

constitutional magnitude.

Second, in Chapman versus California, of

Therefore, Bruno has no —

I wonder if that is correct, Hr.

9

Chapman against California?
MR. DE PUE:

Was the federal harmless error statute at issue

No, Your Honor, it wasn't.

That

was a state case.
QUESTION:

12

So it wasn't — the federal

13

harmless error statute was not involved at all in that

14

case?

15

MR. DE PUE:

16

QUESTION;

No, it wasn’t, Justice —
And it's a different standard that

17

the court applied than the harmless — the statutory

18

harmless error standard.

19

Griffin standard is the same standard that was described

20

in Justice Rutledge's opinion in Kotteakos, do you?

Stevens.

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

clear that the degree of certitude between the

2

constitutional harmless error standard and the standard

3

for non-constitutional errors is different.
QUESTION:

4

The statute says that you've got to

5

be sure that the error does not affect the substantial

6

rights of the parties.

7

commenting on the failure of the witness to get on the

8

witness stand, failure of the defendant to get on the

9

witness stand does not affect a substantial right?
HR. DE PUE«

10

Now, do you suggest that

I suggest. Justice Stevens, that

11

there may be some instances, indeed many instances,

12

where indirect allusions to the defendant's failure to

13

take the stand may be deemed harmless, yes.

\

QUESTION:

14

They may be deemed harmless, but

15

within the meaning of the statute, would you say that a

16

comment on the defendant's failure to take the witness

17

stand does not affect his constitutional right not to

18

testify?

19

HR. DE PUE:

20

QUESTION:

21

22

No, it wouldn’t.
Then the statute simply does not

apply.
HR. DE PUE:

Well, I believe, Justice Stevens,

23

as I said before, that it depends upon the context of

24

the -- that it depends on the context of the situation.

25

That you simply — you simply cannot say that --

14

Second, even where —

QUESTIONS

The standard is

Is it your view that, for example,

16

if television covers an event in which a crime, a murder

17

takes place, that the evidence then corroborated by

the prosecutor would constitute reversible error?

HR. DE PUE:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, harmless

harmless error statute of Fahy versus Connecticut.

5

Mow, even —

6

QUESTION:

Under your view, if the defendant

7

didn't have a lawyer, and the evidence was just as clear

8

as you hypothesize, could that error ever be harmless?

9

HR. DE PUE:

Absolutely not, because that

would pervade the entire nature of the proceedings.

11

That sort of thing is not subject to any kind of an

12

accurate assessment, but this, we believe, is, because

13

the Court can look, at that — look at that remark, look

14

at how pervasive and how direct it is, look at the

15

evidence, look at the judge’s instruction, and all sorts

16

of other things, and determine whether there was

17

adequate damage control done to deem that it was

18

harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

19

Now, even where it is otherwise permissible to

20

employ the supervisory power for didactic or

21

prophylactic purposes over agents of the executive

22

branch, this Court has made it clear that such authority

23

should be exercised sparingly, and only in the face of

intentional transgressions of legal norms.

Any didactic benefits that arguably might result from a

accepted test for determining whether a Griffin

violation has occurred embraces both intentional and

unintended reference to the defendant's failure to

testify.

Remarks, although not intended as comments,

11

are later subject to a construction, a reasonable

12

construction that the jury could reasonably infer that

13

they are related to the defendant's failure to testify.

14

It is a rare case indeed that a prosecutor in

15

the wake of Griffin and Chapman sets out comment on the

16

defendant's failure to testify.

17

Chapman and Griffin violations occur where an appellate

18

court with the benefit of hindsight and after looking at

19

the totality of the evidence, the posture of the defense

20

case, the defense theory, the totality of the

21

prosecutor's remarks, concludes that the prosecutor

22

overstepped an indistinct line between perfectly

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

of the federal courts of appeals.

Like Chapman, it

involves comments on the failure to testify, and like

Chapman, for purposes of review, the error was conceded,

but there are significant differences.

In Chapman, at the time the comment was made,

the courts had not yet found that that type of comment,

at least in the state court setting, was constitutional

error.

QUESTION*

Well, I might -- I guess you have

24

to address the government’s position, then, that the

25

harmless error statute forecloses the court of appeals

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

from doing what it did here
MR. ESPOSITO;

2

That’s exactly correct, Your

3

Honor, and we believe that it does not foreclose it.

4

First of all, in Bruno, the court indicated that the

5

harmless error statute was not intended to apply to

6

commands of Congress and respondents contend that it

7

very logically and easily flows that it would not

8

respond to -- would not apply to constitutional

9

violations either.
Let me make a point about the legislative

10

11

history, since the Court directed some questions to it.

12

The statute was repealed in 1947, I believe.

13

repealed because of the enactment of the Federal Rules

14

of Civil Procedure.

15

realized that the Federal Rules did not apply to the

16

courts of appeals in the Supreme Court, so it was in

17

fact re-enacted.
QUESTION;

18

The following year, in

It was

'48, it was

Well, the Federal Rules of Civil

19

Procedure were promulgated, as I recall, in 1934.

20

did Congress not get around to repealing this thing that

21

they felt was inconsistent with it until 1947?

9

is, from respondent’s view, and what we see of the

So it was re-enacted, and

So, there really

10

legislative history, no change in the legislative

11

intent.
QUESTION:

12

Well, don’t you think the dropping

13

of the word ’’technical" after Justice Frankfurter’s

14

opinion in Bruno had referred to it as kind of a matter

15

of etiguette and that sort of thing, meant that Congress

16

intended a little more bite to the thing than it had

17

before?

18

MR. ESPOSITO:

Your Honor, we believe that if

19

the Court -- excuse me, if the Congress had intended to

20

change it, there would have been much more discussion.

21

QUESTION;

Why need there be any discussion if

22

Congress chooses to enact something which in fact

23

changes it?

24
25

MR. ESPOSITO:

Because the commands of this

Court or the reading of this Court was so -- was so very

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

clear.

In the language of the legislative report -- in

2

the bill that was enacted, in the bill in which it was

3

re-enacted, all that bill was doing was to make

typographical change, delete sections that should have

5

been deleted before, add sections that shouldn’t have

NR. ESPOSITO;

Well, the closest I can find,

16

Your Honor, is the House report on the bill, which just

17

very briefly talked about it, and again, I would contend

18

that that indicates that Congress was not intending a

19

substantive change that may change the prior readings,

20

prior readings of the court, and there is some language,

21

very briefly, by Senator O'Conner, the Senator from

22

Maryland, I believe, who also indicated that this bill

23

doesn’t really mean to — wasn’t meant to make a great

24

substantive impact in the law.

So, we contend that there is still — there is

2

nothing in the legislative history, in fact, nothing in

give a copy of that opinion to the assistant attorneys

or to issue an explanatory memorandum.

have plenary jurisdiction on admitting lawyers to

8

practice in the district court and in turn in the court

9

of appeals?

10

MR. ESPOSITO;

11

QUESTION;

They do, Your Honor.

In your view, would the court of

12

appeals exceed its supervisory powers or its powers

13

generally if they issued an order to show cause why a

14

lawyer who violated rules in their view should be

15

disciplined, or the order to show cause would be to show

16

cause why he should not be disciplined?
MR. ESPOSITO;

court, Your Honor?

Disciplined by the district

Or by the court of appeals?

19

QUESTION;

Either, or both.

20

MR. ESPOSITO;

21

QUESTION;

Either.

Well, I gather the district court

22

wouldn’t have been disciplining him, because they

23

thought it wasn't even a violation of the Fifth

24

Amendment.

MR. ESPOSITO;

your point. Your Honor.

MR. ESPOSITO!

It is in the

Your Honor, I would suggest

5

that part of the business is the education of

6

prosecutors, and that is part of the basis for the

7

harmless error rule itself.

8

error rule is designed in the first instance to affirm a

9

conviction, to affirm the result when the result did not

Certainly the harmless

10

prejudice the defendant, but the rule goes farther.

It

11

tells a prosecutor, it tells the government itself that

12

conduct that was committed at trial was wrong, it was

13

improper, and hopefully through the force of that

14

decision itself it coerces a prosecutor not to repeat

15

those comments in the future.

16

education comes in, through the proper use of the rule.

That is where the

17

I think what is happening in the Seventh

18

Circuit, and I believe what the Seventh Circuit is

19

despairing of through a reading of all these opinions is

20

the fact that in a sense that harmless error, the

21

rationale is being broken.

23

used to justify the conduct.

24

there is error and just —

error, why should the court of appeals worry about it?
MR. ESPOSITO;

2

Because it is still. Your

3

Honor, a violation of constitutional rights, and it

4

still has an effect on the system itself.
QUESTION:

5

6

Well, what effect does it have on

the system if it is harmless error?
NR. ESPOSITO:

7

It affects the system in the

8

way a prosecutor -- a trial is conducted.

9

requires certain norms of conduct within it.
QUESTION;

10

Our system

Yes, and the norms of conduct are

11

set up, and then reversals are not to occur if there is

12

only harmless deviation from them, and by hypothesis,

13

what we are talking about is a harmless deviation from

14

them.

Why should that concern anybody?
NR. ESPOSITO;

15

Just because, Your Honor, of

16

the basic manner in which the prosecution is being

17

gathered, in which the system is being gathered.

18

guess you can say the same thing. Your Honor, of a

19

coerced confession or any other type of constitutional

20

problem.

It is bigger than both of us?
It may be.

Was this widespread throughout the

Seventh Circuit?
MR. ESPOSITO;

The Seventh Circuit has dealt

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

with this particular issue in eight cases, and they have

2

come throughout different districts in the circuit.

3

Yes, Your Honor.

4

QUESTIONS

But not in other circuits?

5

MR. ESPOSITO*

The court wasn't -- the problem

6

has appeared in other circuits.

As a matter of fact, in

7

the First Circuit, eleven years ago, the First Circuit

8

adopted a rule under its supervisory powers to provide

9

for reversals for comments on the — indirect comments

10

like this comment on the failure to testify where

11

certain preconditions aren't established.

12

appeals had threatened to employ that rule in the

13

Seventh Circuit, but didn’t go so far as to do it.

14

The court of

I would like to address the question of

15

standards that can be applied.

16

this is something that has to be an unlimited review.

17

It is something that the Seventh Circuit can use to

18

reach a result whenever it wants.

19

I don't believe that

Supervisory powers, of course, are to be

20

reluctantly exercised.

I think that is clear from this

21

Court's case law.

22

and where -- and in determining whether to exercise the

23

discretion in cases of this type, in the case of this

24

type is repeated misconduct which the prosecutor's

25

failure to conform to decisions, the court should look

But it is a discretionary power, too,

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

first of all to the type of error involved, dealing with

2

constitutional error, command of Congress.

3

look to whether they have addressed, that particular

4

court has addressed the problem in the past, whether it

5

has set forth a clear legal principle, whether it is a

6

principle that can be applied broadly to many types of

7

cases such as this type of case, and whether that

8

principle has been disseminated in sufficient time to

9

give prosecutors the practical means of incorporating

10

It should

the principle into the methods of prosecution.
Any of these factors are met, and they are

11
12

certainly met in this case, the number of times that the

13

court has -- has to deal with the problem in a sense

14

becomes an aggravating factor, making the exercise even

15

more appropriate.

16

discretion in this regard, the decision should be

17

affirmed.

18

If the court didn't abuse its

hr. Esposito, I gather your answer

to the government's argument is that exercise of

It seems to me it very logically follows that

Even assuming, Your Honor, assuming arguendo

11

that the statute could be applied, may be applicable, we

12

contend that the harmless error statute was not intended

13

to deprive the court of their traditional supervisory

14

powers, powers that are recognized in WcNabb, powers

15

that are recognized in Donnelly versus DeChristoforo,

16

for instance, to deter prosecutorial misconduct.

17

powers, we believe, are still there, and absent

18

something much clearer that would indicate that the

19

Congress meant to take away that power, that supervisory

20

power is there.

21

Those

In sum, Your Honor, we believe that above all,

22

the supervisory powers are the powers of flexibility.

23

They enable the courts to determine whether a rigid

24

application to a particular legal principle is really

25

going to frustrate rather than promote the interests of
