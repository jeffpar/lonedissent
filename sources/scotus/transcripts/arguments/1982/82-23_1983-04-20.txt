ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHANLER D. CRONK, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. CRONK:

7
8

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
This matter is here on petition for certiorari

9
10

to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.

It derived from

11

an action brought by Respondent, a member of the

12

Nebraska legislature, over three years ago by which he

13

sought to challenge the legislature's traditional method

14

of opening each legislative day's sitting with a brief

15

invocation offered by a cleric chaplain, a

16

non-legislator officer of the legislature.
The basis of that challenge was that

17
18

legislative prayers employed by the legislature in that

19

manner per se violated the establishment clause of the

20

First Amendment.
QUESTION:

21

On the basis of his claim, would it

22

make any difference whether it was a paid or an unpaid

23

clergyman?

24
25

MR. CRONK:

Senator Chambers' precise claim

was that1 the prayers, apparently definitionally being a

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

per se violation of the Constitution, by practical

2

operation obviated the necessity for compensating anyone

3

to provide them, obviated the necessity obviously,

4

again, from practical considerations of even having a

5

prayer book, and in that way the compensation of the

6

chaplain would fall.

7

It's pretty clear from the record that his

8

case focused exclusively on the proposition that

9

prayers, at least the prayers offered by the then

10

chaplain, the only ones that we have any evidence of in

11

the record, themselves violated the Constitution, so

12

obviously we now would have no reason to compensate

13

anybody to give them, at least Reverend Palmer.

14

I do not believe and I do not think the record

15

reflects any independent basis for invalidating the

16

compensation of the chaplain, and I think that the Court

17

of Appeals realized somewhat of an incongruity in

18

declining to rule the legislative prayers per se

19

unconstitutional and at the same time finding a fault

20

with their compensation, in the absence of any

21

independent basis.

22

I think it is pretty clear that the Court of

23

Appeals attempted to link the compensation problem with

24

the tenure of Chaplain Palmer.

25

2UESTI0Ns

Does the record show what the

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

compensation was, how much it was?

2

MR. CRONK;

It changed from time to time.

At

3

the time of filing the action, it was approximately $320

4

per month.

5

the first year four months, the second year three

6

months.

The legislature sits in biannual sessions,

7

QUESTION*

8

MR. CRONK:

9

So it is seven months, $320.
Roughly, seven months per two-year

session.

10

As I mentioned, I think it is pretty clear

11

from the Court of Appeals decision that the per se

12

challenge initiated by the Respondent was rejected by

13

the court and instead, surprising in view of the case

14

that was presented at trial, the Court of Appeals

15

singled out principally an additional factor, and that

16

was the retention and compensation of a particular

17

chaplain for an extended period of time, without any

18

indication of what constituted an extended period of

19

time.

20

at least is such an extended period of time.

We are to conclude from the opinion that 16 years

There are some particular facts in the record

21
22

that should be briefly alluded to because they bear

23

directly on what facts and circumstances at all appear

24

in the record relevant to that basis for the court's

25

decision.

The chaplaincy practice has existed in

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Nebraska since 1855, 12 years before statehood.

2

At the time of filing the action, the

3

chaplain, along with three other non-legislator

4

traditional officers, the other three being the clerk,

5

the assistant clerk and the sergeant at arms, were

6

recommended at the beginning of each biannual session by

7

the legislature's Executive Board, its administrative

8

oversight body, for the legislature's full approval.

9

These individuals were essentially treated as

10

employees of the legislature.

11

part of the usual process by which the legislature

12

compensated its employees.

13

They were compensated as

And the evidence I think is quite clear,

14

although it's not overly abundant, that the legislature

15

itself had never considered over the course of time the

16

post of chaplain or any particular individual’s

17

retention as chaplain as an issue of substantive

18

importance in the legislative process.

19

hint of any controversy, of any complaint, any concern

20

about either the post of chaplain or any particular

21

chaplain whatsoever prior to the time that Respondent,

22

as a member of the Executive Board in 1979, attempted to

23

get that body to recommend that the post be totally

24

eliminated and, as he put it, failing that at least

25

com pensation.

We have not one

QUESTIONS

3
4

Well, Mr. Attorney General, you

MR. CRONK;

We don’t know that, Your Honor.

The only thing we know about --

5

QUESTION;

Well, I was going to ask you, if

6

you said so, name him, because I’m sure there’s not — I

7

thought that was admitted.

8
9

MR. CRONKs
Honor.

No, I don’t believe it was, Your

We never had any evidence at all in the record

10

about the denominational affiliations, even the

11

identities, of any chaplains prior to Palmer.

12

13

QUESTIONS

Well, you have the prayers are in

the record, aren't thay?

14

MR. CRONKs

On three occasions during chaplain

15
16

QUESTION;

17

MR. CRONK:

18

QUESTION;

Aren’t the prayers in the record?
Certain of them are.
Do you have any prayer in there

19

that doesn’t invoke the guidance of Christ,

20

C-h-r-i-s-t?

21

Can you show me one?

MR. CRONKs

I believe there are prayers that

22

make reference to deity identifiable to the

23

Judaeo-Christian heritage, as Chaplain Palmer put it.

24

There are certain prayers that expressly mention Jesus

25

Christ.

I think the record reflects roughly half, a

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

little less than half of the prayers, in addition to

2

making reference to deity, that might be identified in

3

the Judaeo-Christian heritage, do mention Jesus Christ.

4

QUESTION:

5

You don't admit it?

6

MR. CRONK:

7

QUESTION:

8

Don't admit what, Your Honor?
That they're all Christians, all of

the chaplains have been Christians?
MR. CRONK:

9
10

But you don't admit it, do you?

We simply have no idea, Your

Honor.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. CRONK:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. CRONK:

You have no idea?
Absolutely none.
I see.
The only thing we know about any

15

prior chaplain is that^ Chaplain Palmer himself became a

16

candidate for the post because of the death of his

17

predecessor in office.

18

One of the important facts relevant to the

19

Court of Appeals' basis for this conclusion is simply

20

the fact that over the entire some 130 year history of

21

the Nebraska chaplaincy, in keeping with the fact that

22

the legislative post and any particular individual had

23

never caused any concern from the public or from the

24

legislature, the practice developed that the chaplain,

25

as well as the other non-legislator traditional

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

officers, would be reappointed.
Both Respondent Senator Chambers and Executive

2
3

Board Chairman Lewis indicated that it simply was the

4

common practice that the four incumbents to the office

5

would be slated again, unless there was an objection

6

from somebody.

7

Executive Board recommend an incumbent for an ensuing

8

session of the legislature was a five to four vote.

9

All that was needed in order to have the

There simply had never been any objection to

10

that process, which I think is reflective of the fact

11

that it had never engendered any controversy or concern

12

whatsoever up to this point, up to the filing of the

13

action.
Chaplain Palmer, who has served since 1965,

14
15

clearly indicated that he became a candidate for the

18

vacancy at that time as an individual, not as a

17

representative of his church.

18

become involved in civic activities to the extent his

19

time permits.

20

served.

21

His church allows him to

It’s in that capacity that he has

The only evidence that is in the record

22

concerning Chaplain Palmer's own individual retention

23

comes from the Executive Board Chairman, Frank Lewis,

24

who had been a member of the legislature since 1972 and

25

was Chairman of the Executive Board at time of trial in

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

1979, that Palmer had simply been reappointed because he

2

had done a good job, very much consistent with what the

3

usual process was.

4

QUESTIO»:

Mr. Cronk, is there evidence in the

5

record that Chaplain Palmer ever refused to allow any

6

guest chaplain to appear?

7

ME. CRONK:

There is no evidence in the record

8

that there was any such refusal.

9

makes quite clear that on frequent occasion he solicited

In fact, the record

10

clergypersons of other denominations to fill in for

11

him.

12

the legislature, because of a special occasion, the

13

death of a friend or what-not, would suggest that a

14

particular chaplain fill in.

15

It was frequently the occasion that a member of

No such request was ever denied.

Chaplain

16

Palmer indicated there were other denominations and

17

religions represented, mentioning clerics of the Jewish

18

faith in particular.

19

QUESTION:

I might add —
Does the record disclose when the

20

prayers were recited and at what point in the orders of

21

the day that that practice occurred?

22

MR. CRONK:

The record does, Your Honor.

The

23

prayer was essentially the first step beginning each

24

legislative day’s sitting.

25

was called to order at 9:00 in the morning, sometimes

The legislature typically

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

10:00.

2

depending on when each day's starting time was

3

scheduled.

4

That would be the first matter of business,

The Petitioners have always maintained that,

5

on the basis of this particular record and on the basis

6

of any record that could have been developed by any

7

different approach to this establishment clause

8

challenge to the legislative practice, that it stands in

9

its entirety, and is not changed by specific analysis on

10

any one of its several components, as essentially a

11

tradition of the legislature, more steeped in ceremony

12

than actually any substantive import, by which the

13

legislature has sought to begin each day’s business in a

14

solemn tone, hopefully setting an attitude of high

15

purpose, although Chaplain Palmer quite readily admits

16

that he would be hard pressed to admit that happens on

17

all occasions.

18

served in his post does not change that fact, the fact

19

that he served for some 16 years.

And the fact that Chaplain Palmer has

20

Fundamental, we believe, in this analysis is

21

recognition of several historical considerations which

22

clearly are relevant because of the fact that

23

legislative chaplaincies substantially, if not

24

virtually, identical to that in Nebraska have a rich

25

history in our national heritage.

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

I think the importance with regard to certain

2

activities that are interpreted under the religion

3

clauses today that have such a history, of an

4

investigation into that history and of a taking into

5

account in the establishment clause analysis of that

6

history, has been clearly indicated by this Court in

7

cases such as Walz versus Maryland -- Walz versus Tax

8

Commissioner and McGowan versus Maryland.

9

And I balieve the factors that were singled

10

out there and that played a substantial part in the

11

decisions in those Courts are also existent here and

12

were totally ignored by the Court of Appeals, which

13

fundamentally flawed its analysis.

14

We do have the benefit of examining an

15

activity today that not only existed at the time the

16

framers were drafting the First Amendment, but was

17

actually practiced by them at the very time the First

18

Amendment was drafted.

19

contemporaneous with the drafting of any particular

20

amendment which we are today attempting to interpret was

21

recently underscored by this Court in the Minneapolis

22

Star and Tribune case.

23

The existence of evidence

I think the record before the Court quite

24

convincingly indicates that three days before the final

25

wording of the First Amendment was settled on, including

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the religion clauses, the very same framers enacted

2

legislation compensating the officers of both of their

3

houses, including chaplains.

4

to that time, the First Continental Congress employed or

5

utilized a cleric to begin its legislative sessions.

6

was compensated at the end of his tenure and his tenure

7

was for a number of years.

8
9

Even some 15 years prior

He

Subsequent to the drafting of the First
Amendment and the convening of the first Congress under

10

the Constitution, the federal practice has been

11

virtually identical to that that has been employed in

12

Nebraska.

13

Equally important is the fact that the same

14

activity, the same practice in substantially identical

15

form, has enjoyed widespread acceptance throughout the

16

states.

17

Conference of State Legislatures reaffirms what had

18

previously been noted in the decisions of a few courts

19

construing cases such as this, that legislative bodies

20

in every state traditionally have opened their

21

legislative daily sessions with prayer, that over half

22

of them have compensated the individuals performing that

23

service, and --

QUESTION*

Mr. Cronk, in this case did the

chaplain do anything other than give a prayer?

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

MR. CRONK:

I think, the record indicates that

2

his only service is the provision of the morning prayer,

3

and that's provided for by legislative rule.

4
5

QUESTION;

Yes, but I mean that was actually

true?

6

MR. CRONK:

7

QUESTION;

This is true.
May I ask you if you think the

8

result would be the same if the rule had provided that

9

every committee hearing shall open with a prayer?

10

MR. CRONK;

It’s difficult to assess whether

11

the result would be the same in any particular

12

situation, because this, like most establishment clause

13

cases, has to be determined on the basis of its own

14

facts and circumstances.

15

He would simply have to know, we would have to

16

inquire, we would have to find out, what the reason for

17

requiring --

18

QUESTION:

The same reason here, to have a

19

solemn beginning and get everybody in the proper mood to

20

start their deliberations.

21

MR. CRONK;

It doesn't strike me that we

22

necessarily would conclude that that, such a practice,

23

moves us more toward the impermissible.

24

be a number of explanations for why such a requirement

25

would ever be evolved in a particular legislature, just

But there could

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

as there could be a number of explanations as to why

2

specific state legislatures employ legislative prayer

3

practices or retain particular individuals.

4

What we know here is that there is nothing

5

inform in the way that the Nebraska legislature has done

6

so over the past 100 years.

7

QUESTION;

Would you have any trouble with the

8

Nebraska rule if it said — if 16 years ago they passed

9

a rule that said, for the next 16 years the prayer shall

10

11

be conducted by a Presbyterian minister?
NR. CRONK:

I think that that moves us more

12

toward -- the suggestion in your question is that that

13

singles out a particular denomination officially.

14

QUESTION;

Well, that's one of the things that

15

apparently troubled the Court of Appeals.

16

wondering if, instead of looking at it in hindsight, we

17

looked at it in advance, would it bother you at all?

18

HR. CRONKs

I was just

I think that that would cause more

19

problem than has been caused by this situation that we

20

actually have before us.

21

good cause for an inquiry as to what the purpose for the

22

requirement was.

23

I think clearly it would be

All that we know now — and it draws back to

24

the unique circumstances of this case -- all that we

25

know now is that Chaplain Palmer was retained simply

15

in the record that in 1979 there was some confusion

between the outgoing Executive Board and the incoming

HR. FRIEDMAN;

You would have

I would think so, Your Honor.

How about our invocation that the

Marshal announced this morning when he concluded calling

10

the Court and said at the end, "God save the United

11

States and this honorable Court”?

12

HR. FRIEDMAN;

I don’t think this lawsuit is

13

asking this Court to take a judicial hammer and chisel

14

and do away with all of the terms of religi on, including

15

the opening ceremony by Marshal Wong .

16

we're trying to do.

That ’s not what

I think Marshal Wong's ceremonial opening has

17
18

probably lost any religious significance it may have

19

had, and Marshal Wong is not a chaplain, he's not a

20

clergyman.

21

QUESTION;

Well then, we go back to the

22

members of the legislature.

Senator Chambers' view is very simple.

There has never been any kind of --

of symbolism.

That may be the major problem that we

have here.

Aside from the compensation issue, I think

the symbolism issue is very important.

14

Symbolically,

But you’ve said several times that

even if you had chaplains picked at random one day at a

MR. FRIEDMAN:

I think that's true, Your

Honor.

We must -- I think I must stick with the facts

19

of the case and the issue presented and accepted by this

20

Court for review.

21

even if you had a mix, even if you had somebody each

22

day, even if they were not paid.

But I think it’s still a problem,

23

But that’s not the issue that really is before

24

the Court and that's not the issue that Senator Chambers

25

is litigating at this juncture.

But if you're asking

what Senator Chambers' opinion is or what my personal

Then how about this very short

version that the Marshal uses to summon the Court?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

asked, and the one I have been dreading answering, I

as the name of Goi on public buildings and God on the

Mr. Friedman, do military units

still have chaplains?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

Yes, they do, Justice Powell,

and we don’t quarrel with that.

16

QUESTION:

Why?

17

MR. FRIEDMAN;

We feel that people who are in

18

the military service are taken away from their normal

19

place, they are oftentimes overseas, and to deny them

20

some sort of religious inspiration would probably be a

21

violation of the other part of the clause, the free

22

exercise clause.

23

QUESTION;

Don’t you think legislators are

24

called away from their home counties and are in need of

25

some guidance and inspiration as well?

I think. —

If you have a military unit

7

stationed at some foreign post, remote generally from

8

other people, are you suggesting the chaplain has no

9

opportunity to influence them?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

10
11

I'm sorry. Justice Powell,

I

didn't understand the question.
QUESTION:

12

I said, military units are

13

stationed all over the world and they’re often quite

14

isolated.

15

for a chaplain to have an opportunity, by example or

16

otherwise, to influence other people.

17

chaplain has no influence whatever in a military unit?

18

I don't know.

You are suggesting that it's not appropriate

I'm asking your opinion.

MR. FRIEDMAN:

19

Do you think the

I think they do have some

20

influence, and I guess the answer is I don't know,

21

either.

22

QUESTION:

Well, in any event, Mr. Friedman, I

23

gather what you’re suggesting is that in the case of the

24

military chaplain or the prison chaplain there's a

25

tension between the free exercise and the establishment

39

2

and the interests, override the establishment

3

complications.
MR. FRIEDMAN;

4
5

Brennan.

That’s correct. Justice

That’s what I’m trying to say.
QUESTION;

6

There’s a tension in every

7

application of the religion clauses, a tension between

8

the two branches of the religion clauses.

9

our cases have indicated that, have they not?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

10

And all of

That's correct, Chief Justice.

■»

11

But I think this case is really a very strong case.

It

12

probably goes to the very outer limits.

13

chaplaincy is a paid religious official doing a

14

religious service on the floor of the legislature, and

15

those other cases don't go that far.

The Nebraska

16

Even in establishment clauses cases that ruled

17

against the plaintiff, they never had anything that came

18

close to the factual pattern in this case.

19

QUESTION;

Eut Mr. Friedman, that comes back,

20

of course, to the practice of Congress and the practice

21

in Congress at the formation of this nation and at the

22

time of the adoption of the First Amendment.

23

MR. FRIEDMAN;

Justice O'Connor, at the time

of the First Congress I believe most of the members sent

their children to segregated schools.

And our civilization has changed, Justice
It's changed completely.
Two centuries ago our forefathers knew

religious differences primarily among the d ifferences of

QUESTION;

So to say it’s pluralistic now, it

MR. FRIEDMAN;

It was not nearly as

pluralistic.
QUESTION;

Well, but does that change in

12

degree really mean that we can't accept the meaning that

13

was intended by the people who drafted the amendment as

14

applicable today?

15

MR. FRIEDMAN;

I can’t believe that the

16

framers of the Constitution today would accept the

17

practice in Nebraska.

18

centuries ago, but when they looked at the change of our

19

society, the change of our culture today, I'm sure they

20

would not approve of this practice.

They may have accepted it two

21

In fact, James Madison, who was the drafter of

22

the establishment clause, later in life changed his mind

We think he

made a mistake, too, when he voted -QUESTION;

9

That's like saying, well, I know

10

the First Amendment means so-and-so but I wish it meant

11

it something else.

12

MR. FRIEDMAN;

Justice White, this matter

13

really has never had the opportunity to be presented to

14

this Court.

16
17

Eack in 1922 -Well, you have the opportunity

now .
MR. FRIEDMAN;

That's what we're trying to do.

18

Justice White.

And I think one of the problems is that

19

there was no procedural avenue to get the matter to this

20

Court's attention two centuries ago.

21

avenue is open now through virtue of the Civil Rights

22

Act, which is the suit -- which is the statute under

23

which this case was filed.

The procedural

24

And we ask the Court to take a strong look at

25

this, because symbolically this is extremely important.

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

I think the Nebraska practice hits square on with the

2

neutrality theme that this Court has always maintained

3

in most of the establishment clause cases, going through

4

Everson and McGowan, Abbington, Walz and Epperson.
All of the establishment clause cases,

5
6

irrespective of whether they held for the plaintiff or

7

for the defendant, the one rule that this Court has

8

always had is that when it comes to government, when it

9

comes to religion, government must remain strictly

10

neutral, neither endorsing or appearing to endorse one

11

religion over another or religion in favor of

12

non-religion.

13

And it seems to me that the record in this

14

case supports the conclusion that one religion is in

15

fact better than others.

16

there is the testimony of Dr. Palmer, who said — would

17

you agree that by having a uniquely Christian chaplain

18

in the legislature it adds an air of officialdom to the

19

Christian faith?

20

such.

21

In the record, for example,

And he says, it could be perceived as

But the other witnesses also agreed to that.

22

Reverend Stevens, who is a Unitarian minister, testified

23

as an expert on behalf of the Plaintiff, and he said it

24

certainly adds an air of officialdom to one religion.

25

And of course, Senator Chambers said the same thing.

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

And that probably is one of the key problems

2

that we have here.

3

religion that stands out in a very p luralistic society

4

seems to cause some problems.

*

1

1

the Court is that this practice of having one uniquely

2

religious figure who belongs to one religion is just

3

like having a small statute or a small pennant on the

4

flag with a religious symbol on it.

5

but it's there and you can see it and everybody knows

6

that it's there.

7

And that's the problem here.

Everybody knows

8

that the officer of that court or the officer of the

9

10

been, and I submit always will be.

3

HR. FRIEDMAN;

QUESTION;

I can't prove that.

May I ask this.

Was that the type

5

of establishment that the framers had in mind when they

6

included the establishment clause in the Bill of

7

Rights?

8

indeed, to many of them and to their ancestors in

9

Western Europe.
MR. FRIEDMAN;

10
11
12

13
14

They were thinking about what had happened,

Powell.

That’s correct, Justice

I think -2UESTI0N;

There you had a true establishment,

that the church and state were essentially the same.
MR. FRIEDMAN;

I think that a legal historian

15

could probably make a good argument that one of the

16

reasons they called it "establishment" was that many of

17

the states had their own established churches at that

18

time and they didn't want the Federal Government to get

19

involved in it.

20
21

22

It wasn’t until 1940 that the establishment
clause was held applicable to the states.
QUESTION;

Mr. Friedman, before this case was

23

filed, in your own estimation how many people outside

24

the legislature knew about the chaplain?

25

MR. FRIEDMAN;

Oh, I think the whole state

chaplain there?
MR. FRIEDMAN;

7

Oh, I think they knew there was

8

a chaplain.

I don’t think they paid much attention to

9

him, Justice Powell — Justice Marshall.
QUESTION:

10

Now, this has bean going on for

11

more than 200 years, right back to the Confederation.

12

Would you say that we ara closer to having an

13

established church, such as England and Sweden, for

14

example, today than we were 200 years ago?
MR. FRIEDMAN:

MR. CRONKs

13

If there's one thing that the Court should

that these are very difficult cases and they depend

one thing that is conspicuous about the symbolic

Absolutely not.
