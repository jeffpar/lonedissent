CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments first

this afternoon in Mueller and Noyes against Allen.

Mr. Kampf, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM I. KAMPF, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. KAMPF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Minnesota has adopted a comprehensive scheme for

10

compulsory free public education which is embedded in its

11

constitution.

12

elementary and secondary schools in the State of Minnesota.

13

Minnesota prohibits tuition and fee charges for required

14

educational courses for students attending public schools.

15

Over 730,000 students presently attend public

Over 91,000 students presently attend private elementary

16

and secondary schools in Minnesota.

17

whose primary function is the inculcation of religion.

18

these schools —

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. KAMPF:

21

QUESTION:

Of these, 96% are in schools
All of

Are you speaking of the primary schools?
Primary and secondary, Mr. Justice.
Primary and secondary.

You say their

22

function is to inculcate religion or does not the State of

23

Minnesota require certain basic — the same basic standards as

24

for all public schools?

25

MR. KAMPF:

Mr. Chief Justice, my understanding from
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

this Court's prior rulings in Lemon and Nyquist was that the

2

Court believes that the primary function of a religious school

3

is to inculcate religion through the educational process.

4

I am simply giving —

5

QUESTION:

And,

Do you understand the Court to have laid down

6

some abstract kind of rulei of law about numerous different kinds

7

of parochial schools or private schools; that you don't need

8

record support any more for a particular factual conclusion?

9

MR. KAMPF:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, my understanding is

10

that the 96% of the private school students who attend religious

11

schools are schools that identify themselves as religious schools,

12

and as I believe the Court previously found, those schools'

13

primary function then is to teach religion.

14
15

QUESTION:

You mean found about these particular schools

in Minnesota?

16

MR. KAMPF:

17

QUESTION:

No.
Are you suggesting they are just all

18

homogenized, that if a school is identified as a religious

19

school, as you put it, it is automatically — Its primary

20

function is to inculcate religion?

21

22
23

MR. KAMPF:

Yes, I believe that would be the teaching

that I have taken from the Court's decision in Lemon and Nyquist.
The statute in question permits parents of both public

24

school children who do not incur tuition and parents of sectarian

25

school children who do to deduct expenses incurred for tuition

up to $500 for grades K through 6, $700 for grades 7 through 12

from their taxable income.

3

In addition, deduction for textbook and transportation

4

expenses are permitted even though Minnesota already provides

5

equal amounts of textbooks and transportation to students in both

6

public and parochial schools.

7

QUESTION:

8
9

Are they all private schools or just church-

sponsored schools?
MR. KAMPF:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I refer to

10

parochial schools as a result of the fact that it is such a

11

high percentage, that is to say the 96%, that the remaining 4%,

12

which would be deemed to be non-sectarian, would pay out until

13

insignificance.

14

students —

Obviously by that I mean all private school

15

QUESTION:

16

church sponsorship?

17

MR. KAMPF:

What about a private school that has no

They would receive the same benefits as those;

18

that have church sponsorship.

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Mr. Kampf, how much of these two deductible

amounts have been increased since 1956?
MR. KAMPF:

The original was $200.

It was changed in

22

1976 to the present levels of $500 and $700.

23

have been bills in every biennial session of the legislature

24

since to increase it as much as 100% from that level.

25

QUESTION:

However, there

Those bills have not carried?

MR. KAMPF:

They have only carried one House at a time

up to this date, Mr. Justice Powell.

The total of tuition and fees paid to public schools

in Minnesota by over 800,000 students in the fiscal year 78-79

was approximately $2 million.

6

charges.

7

that year, some of which would be deductible and some of which

8

would not, was only approximately $900,000.

This would include driver education

The total of other fees paid to the public schools in

9

By contrast, the total amount deducted under the

10

statute in that same year was over $19 million.

11

deductible expenses, other than the $2.9 million I previously

12

alluded to for public school students' families, would be

13

relatively minor amounts such as pencils, supplies, and atheletic

14

equipment.

The only other

This statute represents an attempt to do that which

16

this Court has previously prohibited in the Lemon and Nyquist

17

cases.

18

subsidize an activity intented to inculcate religion.

19

The statute advances religion in that its effect is to

Petitioners ask the Court to simply apply controlling

20

constitutional standards firmly rooted in prior decisions as set

21

forth in the Nyquist case.

22
23

QUESTION:

deductibility of contributions to such schools?

24
25

Would you challenge the deductions of — the

MR. KAMPF:

No, that is not at issue in this case, Mr.

Justice.

2

QUESTION:

Well, I just asked you, would you think they

would be questionable under your thesis?

3

MR. KAMPF:

4

QUESTION:

Not —
Are these deductions subsidies, deductions

5

of contributions?

6

to a religiously sponsored school a subsidy?

7

Is the right of a donor to deduct contributions

MR. KAMPF:

As I would indicate later in my argument,

8

Mr. Justice, the deduction of a contribution which comes out

9

of volunteerism is vastly different than a deduction of a fee for

10

a service.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. KAMPF:

No.

What is the answer to my question?

I don't believe that this case in any way

13

affects that and I don't believe that deductibility of the

14

contribution to the school would be in question, no, Your Honor.

15
16

QUESTION:
question?

17
18

And, your submission wouldn't put those in

MR. KAMPF:

No.

This only relates to a fee for a

service.

19

This case, we believe, is —

20

QUESTION:

21

22

Do you think there is a constitutional

difference between the two?
MR. KAMPF:

A vast difference.

I think that the Court

23

in Nyquist seemed to indicate that a deduction for a fee for

24

a service is a direct subsidy of the service itself not unlike

25

the deduction for medical services which is clearly a subsidy
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

of good health services.

2

The distinction was in the prohibition —

3

QUESTION:

I suppose you could run the argument either

4

way, that this deduction would be even more clearly constitutional

5

than just a contribution to support religion.

6

MR. KAMPF:

7

QUESTION:

The difference —
This deduction has to do with supporting an

8

educational performance as well.

9

deducting a contribution could be wholly for religious purposes.

10

MR. KAMPF:

As far as you know, just

The distinction between a deduction for a

11

fee for service and the deduction for a voluntary giving is in

12

the quid pro quo; that is to say the donor receives back the

13

religiously-oriented educational services which would not be

14

present in the voluntary contribution.

15

there is no quid pro quo whatsoever.

16

The voluntary contribution,

We believe that there are four ways that this case is

17

controlled by Nyquist, Lemon, and Tilton.

18

this statute is entirely disproportionate and overwhelming in

19

its benefit to religious education.

20
21

First, the effect of

Second, it violates the establishment clause due to
the unrestricted nature of the subsidy inherent in the law.

22

Third, as in Nyquist, it violates the establishment

23

clause because it permits a deduction of a fee for a specific

24

service which is inherently religious.

25

And, fourth and lastly, like the aid in Nyquist and
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Lemon, it would require an impermissible intanglement of the

2

state in religion, both in order to administer and fund it within

3

constitutional limits.
With regard to disproportionality, the benefits of

4
5

this statute flow disproportionately to students attending

6

parochial schools.

7

educational expense is tuition, Minnesota's equivalent of tuition

8

for public schools is its foundation aids which this year are

9

over $1400 per pupil.

Since common sense dictates that the major

As can be seen from the facts in this case, the

10
11

overwhelmingly largest form of aid in this case is the deduction

12

for tuition.

13

from the aid allowed in Nyquist.

This deduction is analytically indistinguishable

QUESTION:

14

Mr. Kampf, suppose the state, instead of

15

allowing the tax deduction, had simply given — decided not to

16

run public schools at all and just gave a voucher to the parents

17

and let them send their children to whatever school they wanted.

18

Is there a problem with that?

19

MR. KAMPF:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. KAMPF:

That case is not before the Court and —
I know that.

But, do you see a problem?

I believe that presents some very sub­

22

stantial, different and more sophisticated problems than this

23

case.

24

Constitution requires a free public education for those who

25

desire it is, I believe, distinguishable under the circumstances

In the first instance, the fact that the Minnesota

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

since it does not require the funding of private or religious

2

school education.
QUESTION:

3
4

Well, would you concede that a voucher system

would be constitutional?
MR. KAMPF:

5

No, I would not.

I believe that the voucher

6

system would have the same effect in Minnesota as the deduction;

7

that is to say the funding primarily of religious education.
As the state's own revenue analyses from 1976, 1978,

8
9
10

and 1980 indicate, the state has known throughout that the
primary benefit under this statute is the tuition deduction.
Although Minnesota points to a broad class that benefits

11

12

in theory from the deduction, the deductible non-tuition expenses

13

are plainly insignificant in relation to tuition.

14

Circuit indicated in the Norberg case, they are a mere window

15

dressing.

16

choice by the state not to require taxpayers to disclose the

17

specific nature of the expenses deducted as the forms appended

18

to the briefs make quite clear.

19

however, the facial availability of the tuition deduction only

20

puts sectarian students into a very small number of non-sectarian

21

private school students suffices to establish impermissible

22

effect under Nyquist.

23

As the First

Any lack of evidence on this point results from the

Even without that information,

With regard to the lack of restrictions on the aid,

24

the subsidy resultant from this deduction is without restriction

25

and thereby falls afoul of the limits created in Lemon and Nyquist
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

The flaw lies in the availability of the aid for diversion to

2

religious uses such as the repair of school chapels as was true

3

in Nyquist.

4

permitted in Tilton, requirements have been made that no tax

5

monies flow to religious activities as in the striking down of

6

the 20-year limitation in that case.

7

Even when the aid is permitted, as this Court

Even a subsidy neutral on its face must be restricted

8

when granted to a religious institution, a limitation which

9

this statute fails to meet.

10
11

QUESTION:

Well, this subsidy, you say, is a

deduction?

12

MR. KAMPF:

That is correct.

13

form of a deduction from tax.

14

QUESTION:

It is a subsidy in the

You just told me you wouldn't question an

15

ordinary deduction for a contribution to a religiously-oriented

16

school.

17

contributions not be for a religious purpose, is there?

18

Now, those — There is no requirement that those

MR. KAMPF:

Well, as I indicated, to not tax under

19

those circumstances is the same as to not tax any other idio-

20

homogenary contribtuion.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. KAMPF:

23

then.

24

on tuition.

25

Exactly.

I agree with you.

But, here, there is an exchange in effect

The deduction under the statute is a discount or a rebate

QUESTION:

Well, arguably, the state is getting
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

something for its grant here in a way that it isn't when it

2

just lets you deduct and it doesn't get anything in return.

3

MR. KAMPF:

Well, the answer to that is that the public

4

schools in Minnesota, I believe, are open to all people.

5

children in the state must receive, by the Constitution of

6

Minnesota, a free public education.

7

QUESTION:

All

You are not suggesting though if everybody

8

who was going to private school went to public schools it wouldn't

9

cost the public some money?

10

MR. KAMPF:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. KAMPF:

13

QUESTION:

14

Well, I think the question —
Would you?

Would you?

No, of course not.
All right.

Well, then, the public is

getting a benefit?

15

MR. KAMPF:

That is an indirect benefit which I think

16

the First Amendment requires the public to bear by having free

17

public schools.

18

There is nothing in this statute that restricts the

19

deductibility of field trips, tests, maps, globes, instruction

20

materials or religious instruction itself through the tuition

21

deduction.

22

To allow this pirouette around Lemon and Nyquist is

23

to render them meaningless.

24

direct aid to religious schools, they may not provide such aid

25

indirectly by tax deductions and credits, as I believe Nyquist

Just as states may not provide

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

so firmly held.

2

With regard to the fee for service, I believe that

3

the Court held in Nyquist the deduction of fees for services

4

is a direct subsidy of the service, as I indicated previously,

5

in effect, a discout or rebate.

6

analogous to

7

Congress has recently reduced in order to reduce the amount of

8

medical care consumed.

This is, I believe, directly

the medical services deduction which parenthetically

9

The comparison would be to take the other forms of

10

medical subsidy and compare them to that form of subsidy for

11

religion present here.

12

are direct subsidies of health services.

13

That is to say Medicare and Medicaid

If the State of Minnesota were to fund a program

14

similar to Medicare and Medicaid for religious education,

15

quite clearly under the Lemon case this Court would strike it

16

down.

17

The effect then of this statute is the same as in

18

Nyquist; that is to say the taxpayer acts in either case in

19

anticipation of receiving the benefit of the deduction, thereby

20

subsidizing attendance at a religious school by deducting the

21

fees charged for it.

22

Lastly, this deduction impermissibly entangles the

23

state in religion in two ways.

24

undertake the duty Tilton and Lemon establish of insuring that

25

expenses deducted are not for services or materials used in the

First, if the state were to

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

teaching of religious tenants, then comprehensively entangling

2

audits of tax returns would be required, a task the state has

3

quite obviously already failed at as even a cursory examination

4

of the Minnesota tax returns were revealed.

5

QUESTION:

Does the record in this case, Mr. Kampf,

6

show what is the actual cost per capita to education children

7

in the private schools or in the parochial, church-sponsored

8

schools?

9

MR. KAMPF:

The only thing we have in the record would

10

be the national averages of $500 to $700 in tuition, not the

11

actual cost, Mr. Chief Justice.

record with regard to the actual cost of such —

22

QUESTION:

It must be a great deal more than $500 or

$700.
MR. KAMPF:

I would assume so or they wouldn't be

receiving much of an education, I imagine.
QUESTION:

That figure should not be difficult to

ascertain and could have been put in the record by taking the
total cost of the primary and secondary schools and dividing it
by the number of pupils.
MR. KAMPF:

Unfortunately with regard to private

schools, I don't believe that information —

in excess of that number. ~

QUESTION:

MR. KAMPF:

10
11

12
13
14
15

No.

No more so than the subsidies present

in Lemon or in the repair subsidies present in the Nyquist case.

8
9

So that the $500 or $700 doesn't cover the

entire cost?

6
7

So, we can surmise that the

The tuition deduction itself does not permit examination
of the cost as I indicated was true in Lemon and Nyquist, without
entering into an investigation of the school itself, a procedure
which I believe would be more damaging to the religious function
of the school than it would be to the state.

Similarly, since

the textbook and transportation expense is deductible or for
expenses over and above those already provided equally to
public and private school children and since the State of
" -*#

16
17
18

Minnesota prohibits charging for textbooks in the public schools,
the textbook and transportation deductions may well be for some­
thing beyond secular needs of the students.

19

20
21

22

Again, without entanglingly audits which the state
does not undertake, an impermissible danger exists that the state
is aiding religious activities despite the facial prohibitions
of this statute.

The second form of entanglement is with regard to

QUESTION:

6

private schools are doing a better job than the public schools.

7

MR. KAMPF:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, maybe the legislature feels that

That is quite possible.
That is certainly a logical inference from

the fact you just stated, isn't it?

10

MR. KAMPF:

I assume it is quite possible, Mr. Justice

11

Rehnquist, but I am not sure that the First Amendment would

12

permit that.

13

QUESTION:

It wouldn't permit the State of Minnesota

14

to feel that private schools were doing a better job than public

15

schools?

16
17
18

MR. KAMPF:

To fund them is what I am discussing, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kampf, you suggested the financial

19

crisis in Minnesota.

20

if all the parochial schools were closed up?

21

MR. KAMPF:

I don't think there is anything in the

record of this case or any other case —

QUESTION:

MR. KAMPF:

QUESTION:

7

But, you were talking about a financial

I don't think —
It cost the state $2,400,000 did you say?

What is the annual cost?
MR. KAMPF:

That was in 1978.

I believe that the

8

costs more recently — The last numbers that I saw of an

9

estimate were $15 million for the biennium that is presently

10

going to end June 30th.

Is that in loss of taxes to the state?
Yes.
What is the two million four?
That was the loss of taxes in 1978.
And they increased to $17 million?
For biennium. That is for two years.

Minnesota operates fiscally on a biennium.
QUESTION:

What is the total budget for public education

in Minnesota?
MR. KAMPF:

I am not sure of that, Mr. Justice Powell.

I believe it is in the billions.
QUESTION:

Did you say the pupil cost — What did you

say, $1200, $1400?

MR. KAMPF:

QUESTION:

In excess of $1400.

the total school population was attending sectarian schools in

2

1956 when this statute was enacted?

3

MR. KAMPF:

I don't have those figures.

The only-

4

figures that we have available are for the period from 1976

5

to the present and during that period of time they appeared to

6

have increased substantially.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. KAMPF:

9

What do you mean by substantially?
Well, the numbers in sectarian schools

appear to have remained stable, slightly risen, from 85,000 to

10

91,000, while the number of students attending public schools

11

between 1978 and the present have reduced from — I think it

was 815,000 to 730,000.

QUESTION:

Do you know what the figures were, do you

have an estimate in 1956?
MR. KAMPF:

No, I do not have any knowledge of what

was true in 1956.
QUESTION:

The annual reports of the State Board of

Education would show, wouldn't they?

19

MR. KAMPF:

20

QUESTION:

Yes, I am sure that they would.
Do you agree that the state has a sub­

21

stantial interest in the preservation of non-public schools to

22

afford a choice?

23

MR. KAMPF:

I believe that the state has an important

24

I think you referred to this subsidy, as

it being a discount or rebate on the cost of religious school

MR. KAMPF:

Well, as I understood Walz, it was an

exemption from property tax of the church buildings itself.

think the distinction between the Walz exemption and the deduction

that the courts of the United States have ever measured nor one
that one could place in a quid pro quo; that is to say an

At least I don't believe that any religion thus far

has indicated it is an exchange dollar for dollar for some service
I think that what we are discussing here is an exact
dollar for dollar, in effect, service; that is to say the
religious education flows to the child of the giver of the dollars
who then deducts them.

I think it is more analogous to the

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

4

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS C. BLOMGREN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5

MR. BLOMGREN:

6
7

8
9

Mr. Blomgren?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
The issue in this case is whether by exempting that
portion of a taxpayer's income which has been devoted to the

10

general educational expenses of his or her children.

11

of Minnesota has adopted legislation respecting the establishment

12

of religion.

13

The State

The statute was adopted in 1955 and, as Mr. Justice

14

Powell's questions elicited, it was amended in 1976 to include

15

within the ambit of the deductions certain textbooks and materials

16

which before that time were not covered by the deduction.

17

It was again amended in 1978 to assure that the deduction

18

was taken for those expenses related to curricular activities

19

rather than extracurricular activities.

20

The challenged deduction does not result in a straight

21

$500 benefit or a straight $700 benefit, rather it constitutes

22

a deduction against the income of a taxpayer in calculating

23

taxable income.

24
25

As a matter of fact —

QUESTION:

Mr. Blomgren, to that extent, all of the

taxpayers of the state share, do they not?
21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. BLOMGREN:

Certainly they do.

Certainly they do.

2

And, it is that broad class of beneficiaries which we have said

3

is a crucial part of this particular deduction.

4

point which was relied upon by the three judge district panel

5

which upheld this statute originally in 1978 and by the District

6

Court and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals which upheld it

7

again when it was challenged in. 1980.

8
9

It was that

Now, in assessing the validity of this statute under
the Establishment Clause, it is very important that the Court

10

keep foremost in mind that the central prohibition of the

11

Establishment Clause is the singling out of religious organiza­

12

tions or religious groups for direct assistance.

13

The question of whether or not a statute provides

14

direct assistance is crucial because it is that type of assistance

15

which denotes sponsorship, advancement, a relationship between

16

the state and the religious institutions of the state which is

17

one of sponsor and sponsored.

18

that this Court recognized in Grendel's Den whether or not the statp

19

has entered into a sponsorship relationship with religion.

20

It is also a symbolic matter

It is also important whether or not a statute singles

21

out any particular group or any particular type of institution

22

for benefits, because the Establishment Clause requires neutrality,

23

it requires that legislatures adopt laws which neither advance

24

nor inhibit religious institutions, and to the extent that broad

25

classes of beneficiaries have been identified under a statutue,
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

it indicates that any religious benefit is incidental to that

2

broad classification.
The plaintiff suggests that this case is controlled by

3
4

Nyquist, but the differences between this case and Nyquist are

5

the differences which lie at the heart of the Establishment

6

Clause.

7

8

QUESTION:

Then you are not asking that Nyquist be

overruled?

9

MR. BLOMGREN:

We are not, Your Honor.

We submit that

10

Nyquist was properly decided and can stand equally beside this

11

case.
QUESTION:

12
13

I would like to have you explain the

differences between this case and Nyquist.

14

MR. BLOMGREN:

Okay.

Nyquist involved two types of

programs.

17

essentially in exchange for enrolling their children in non­

18

public schools.

The first was a direct transfer of monies from the

Coupled with that was a very careful —

QUESTION:

One can certainly say that that was true

here at least indirectly.
MR. BLOMGREN:

Your Honor, if it can be said that it

22

is true, it is going to have to be extremely indirectly, because

23

what the legislation —

24

QUESTION:

Explain that, then.

25

MR. BLOMGREN:

Okay.

What the legislature has said is

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

that for those actual expenditures incurred by a particular

2

taxpayer in educating his or her child either in a public or

3

private school, if they actually incurred those expenditures,

4

then it is going to be treated as a reduction in one's net income

5

in arriving at one's taxable income.
Essentially what the legislature has said is that we

6
7

are going to acknowledge the fact that educational expenses,

8

regardless of where those monies are paid, constitute a reduction

9

in available income, in disposable income, in much the same way

10

that payments to physicians or —
QUESTION:

11

So that the rich man's son who goes to St.

12

Paul's Academy in your city gets the same benefit on his parents'

13

return?

14

MR. BLOMGREN:

Your Honor, as with any deduction, there

15

is going to be a disparate effect with regard to the amount of

16

money one actually pays and their particular income.

17

inherent in a deduction under a progressive income tax system.

18

Just as if someone chooses to pay far more money than his neighbor

19

to physicians or for mortgage payments and that person has a

20

higher income, they are going to receive a larger deduction and

21

they are going to be in a substantially different position than

22

those who pay less.

23

That is

But, that has to do with whether or not deductions

24

under progressive income tax system are wise or not.

25

doesn't implicate Establishment Clause values, because it is not

But, it

a distinction made upon religious lives or the singling out of

2

religious institutions or those attending those institutions, but

rather is a long, traditional line of income and expenditure which

are the classic definitions, classic classifications used in an

5

income tax system.

Continuing on —

While I have you interrupted, let me ask

you something about your textbook deduction.

QUESTION:

But, what bothers me with the argument on

23

both sides is it seems to me you are arguing statistics and I

think we really ought to be arguing basic principles.

25

MR. BLOMGREN:

I agree, Your Honor, that we ought not

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

be arguing statistics beyond a particular point.

2

me that the crucial statistics are those which identify whether

3

or not the nominal class provided by the statute actually does

4

result in real and substantial benefits across that class.

5

once it has been established that, by statistical analysis if

6

that need be, that benefits to those in public schools are

7

not illusory, it seems to me then that the classification system

8

has been proven to be neutral and does not result in direct

9

assistance to any specialized class.

It is also important to know that under Section 170,

a wealthy benefactor might buy these same materials, receive a

11

likely to say that that would constitute state or federal

sponsorship.

13

because a wealthy person has provided a fund for those students

to use in buying books, in buying materials, or even in paying

tuition.

3

QUESTION:

I am puzzled about that because isn't the

whole purpose of the statute to provide support for the private

5

sector and keep the other school system alive and to the extent

6

that money is funneled into the people that go to public schools,

it really is kind of incidental, isn't it?

8

major purpose of the statute, let me put it that way.

9

MR. BLOMGREN:

It doesn't serve the

Your Honor, the major purpose of the

10

statute is to assure — There are several purposes of the

11

statute, but one of them is to assure that there is an availability

12

of choice that individuals can make as to whether to attend or not.

13

It is also a legislative recognition that the income

14

devoted to educating one's child does constitute a drain which

15

can equitably and reasonably be recognized by the legislature in

16

identifying taxable income much the same way when you expend money

17

on medical assistance or things of that sort.

18

is going to recognize that in calculating taxable income.

19

The legislature

So that there are benefits and the purpose of the

20

statute is pursued to the extent that there are benefits available

21

for public school students as well.

22

It also seems to me too that even if the purpose were

23

limited solely to maintaining the continued viability, if you

24

will, of private schools so long as there is not a primary effect

25

which advances religion, that purpose certainly is not going to
28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

be considered and invalid sectarian purpose.

2

that this Court has reviewed and many of the types of programs

3

that it has already upheld relate solely to those people attend­

4

ing private schools, non-public schools.

5

most recently are those benefits that were available to the non­

6

public schools in the Regan case where reimbursements for taking

7

attendance, for administering tests, for grading tests were all

8

valid and that is even where you have a purpose that is clearly

9

aimed only at non-public schools.

10

Many of the cases

A very good example

I don't think that is the case

with regard to this particular statute.

11

The plaintiffs do suggest that in a 1976 Revenue

12

Memorandum prepared by a staff member of the Department of

13

Revenue, and it is dated several days after the effective date

14

of the legislature, but I understand there was one before the

15

effective date of the law, but it is my understanding that there

16

was another one floating around before that time, suggests that

17

the benefits are only available to those attending non-public

18

schools.

19

That memorandum represents an attempt by the Revenue

20

Department to say these are the figures we can get, we are going

21

to assume it is only for tuition.

22

showed what actually is going on and what their effect of the

23

statute is it is going to be the more recent data submitted by

24

the Revenue Department which, as the Justice Department's

25

amicus brief indicates, over 204,000 dependents were represented

So that the majority of those people taking

That, it seems to me, is a clear indication of the
broad effect, the broad availability of the deduction.

QUESTION:

7

was that they took?

Does the record tell how large the deduction

8

MR. BLOMGREN:

9

QUESTION:

10

No, it does not.

It may be $5.00 for each or something like

that.

11

MR. BLOMGREN:

Yes.

It does not, although that is

12

definitely a shortcoming in the statistics, but it is not a

13

material one, because —

14

QUESTION:

Well, is it likely that a parent of a public

15

school child would have $500 of non-tuition expenses that would

16

be deductible?

17

MR. BLOMGREN:

Your Honor, it is possible that those

18

attending public schools may.

19

QUESTION:

20

It may be possible, but you are talking

about 100,000 people in your example.

For instance, those —

That is right.

Do you think 100,000 of them had a $500

It seems very unlikely.
MR. BLOMGREN:

It is very unlikely that 100,000 of

them have a full $500 deduction.

But, it is also unlikely that

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

all of those people attending sectarian schools or non-public

2

schools will have maximum deductions as well.

3

In order to achieve that calculation, you have to

4

assume that all private schools charge tuition and I think it

5

is fairly clear that there are some who provide or charge on

6

a basis of whether one can afford it, to what degree one can

7

afford it.

8

The decisions of this case clearly indicate that

9

extensions from taxation do not constitute the active sort of

10

assistance which traditionally has been thought to constitute

11

state sponsorship of religion.

12

where property tax exemption was found not to constitute any

13

active sponsorship of the religious institution.

14

based upon several factors which go to the very heart of the

15

Establishment Clause and go to the very nature of tax deductions.

16

This was true in the Walz case

And, it is

When a state government determines to abstain from

17

taxing income devoted to particular activities, it has not

18

transferred any state money from the treasury to any particular

19

individual or to any particular group.

20

QUESTION:

But, there is no escape, is there, from

21

the fact that every tax deduction, however it is described,

22

whatever its form may be, in effect spreads the burden of that

23

tax deduction over all the taxpayers?

24

MR. BLOMGREN:

25

QUESTION:

That is true.

That was true in Walz, was it not?

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. BLOMGREN:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, that is absolutely true in Walz.

There are atheists and agnostics and persons

3

of a whole range of non-belief were contributing to a part of

4

the church who received the exemption.

5

MR. BLOMGREN:

Your Honor, I don't believe that they

6

are contributing to the support of the church.

7

contributing to is the support of the state and whether or not

8

the state can identify —

9

QUESTION:

They are making up for the fact that the

10

church property was not taxed, were they not?

11

recognize that?

12

What they are

MR. BLOMGREN:

Didn't Walz

Walz recognized the fact that to the

13

extent that some institutions are relieved of the tax burden

14

others will be called upon to pay more.
t

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. BLOMGREN:

To pay more.
But, what is involved at the heart of

17

the Establishment Clause is whether or not the legislature or

18

state government has decided to enter into a sponsorship

19

relationship with the church, advancing its cause by either

20

directing money to an obviously sectarian purpose or singling

21

it out for some particular special kind of benefit.

22

In Walz it was particularly important that religious

23

institutions fell inside a broader class of non-profit

24

institutions and this case essentially presents the issue of

25

whether or not Walz were limited only to educational institutions.
32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

It would somehow therefore be rendered unconstitutional-

2

fact is that those institutions which fall inside the category,

3

the expenditures at those institutions which fall inside the

4

classification system used in the Minnesota deduction constitute

5

all of those expenses that are likely to be incurred or generally

6

The

are incurred by those attending public or private schools.

7

It is impossible to identify, I believe, even if we

8

put our minds to it very strenuously, some type of expenditure

9

which public school students incur which does not receive a

10

deductible status, but, which if incurred by private school

11

students would.

12

by those in public schools do result in tax deductions.

13

Those expenditures which are actually incurred

The benefits that any individual receives under this

14

particular type of deduction are as Justice White pointed out in

15

his question at least more indirect than those an institution

16

would have received under a Walz style tax exemption.

17

What is going on, for instance, in Section 170 is a

18

direct payment to an institution which qualifies for tax

19

deduction.

20

Now, the plaintiffs suggests that the fundamental,

21

crucial distinction is between deductions which are received

22

for payments which flow from disinterested generosity and those

23

which flow from payment as user fees.

24

to identify a constitutionally significant difference in those.

25

If, for instance, the purpose of the Establishment Clause is to

But, it is impossible

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

make sure that the state does not enter into a relationship of

2

sponsorship with a church, then the user fee analysis that the

3

plaintiffs put forth distinguishes between the Section 170 type

4

of direct payment to religious institutions for obviously

5

religious purposes, the building of buildings and payment of

6

fees to clergy, things of that sort, and makes that valid.

7

makes it invalid for persons tp pay tuition to an institution

8

that provides education to his or her child or if, for instance,

9

we were to say that the Establishment Clause's purpose was to make

It

10

sure that no one is taxed in order to support a religion other than of

11

their own choosing, we find that the user fee analysis makes

12

another decision that bears no relationship to the Establishment

13

Clause.

14

to individuals and to institutions are somehow different under

15

that purpose and permits one and invalidates the other.

What it does is to say that equally indirect benefits

The plaintiffs use of statistics is also difficult in

17

this particular case, difficult to identify the reasons for

18

which it is material to Establishment Clause analysis.

QUESTION:

Would the reports of the State Board of

Education provide this information?
MR. BLOMGREN:

The reports of the State Board of

11

Education would show you the general population trends of those

12

attending non-public schools as opposed to those attending

13

public schools.

The revenue data, which is the most recently available,

is attached at the end of our memorandum.

17

made reference to and which resulted in certain calculations

18

which appear at the back of our memorandum.

It is from a study

in support of the petitioners

But, ultimately — Ultimately, details concerning what

20

particular group of people benefited more or were the predominate

21

beneficiaries under the particular statute is, in our estimation

22

and in the estimation of the District Court and the Court of

23

Appeals, irrelevant.

24
25

It is not material to the case.

For instance, if we were to look at which organizations
or group of organizations was the predominate beneficiary under
36

1

Section 170, historically we would find that religious

institutions took the bulk of deductions or the contributions

3

to religious institutions received the bulk of deductions.

4

Similarly, I would suspect, although I am not certain,

5

that religious institutions are also the predominant beneficiaries

6

under Walz style property tax exemptions.

7

not going to be sufficient to hold that that property tax

8

exemption in Walz or Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code

9

are unconstitutional.

But, those facts are

The reason is that the — The Establishment

10

Clause requires that religious institutions and those associated

11

with religious groups be treated neutrally; that they not be

12

hindered, that they not be advanced, but the Establishment

13

Clause does not require that religious institutions always come

14

out second best or religious always come out second best under

15

any neutral set of criteria.

16

The plaintiffs have also suggested that it is important

17

in this case that there is no restriction on the tuition fees

18

which may be paid or the textbooks — Excuse me, the transporta­

19

tion uses which will qualify for deductions.

because you cannot identify the secular from the sectarian or

because the statute doesn't attempt to identify the secular from

But, we recognize in Walz and under Section 170 that
tax deductions are going to be available for people who make
direct payments to the institution.

11

As I have indicated before, Section 170 would permit

12

an individual to supply textbooks, supply Bibles, supply buses

13

to private schools and take a deduction for them.

14

individuals purchase that sort of equipment, that sort of

The primary argument of the plaintiffs and the

think it is important to draw the distinction between Nyquist

and this case because the Nyquist distinctions go to the very

heart of the Establishment Clause jurisprudence.

The Nyquist case involved benefits where the legis­
lature had identified specific amounts of money it wanted to

10

make available to individuals who had enrolled their children

11

in private, predominately sectarian schools.

12

a legislative determination that for performing a specific act

13

a specific amount of money is going to be provided to individuals.

It represents

It is certainly the policy to make it

be that although one is in one district, the school is closer

to someone else.

QUESTION:

9

Thank you very much.

Mr. Kampf, on these statistics that have

been discussed, suppose a case was before the Court with a

10

record that showed that 60% of all the people in the state under

11

a statute like this were in private schools, some of which were

12

non-denominational, non-church sponsored, and some church

13

sponsored.

14

What would your view be of the statute then?
MR. KAMPF:

Well, at that point, one would have to

15

determine whether the primary effect of the statute was, indeed,

16

to aid the religious schools.

17

and I believe that the question is capability of diversion and

18

restriction or lack of it in the statute.

19

20
21

QUESTION:

That is not the facts before us

Well, what about my hypothetical?

We often

ask hypothetical questions just to test the argument.
MR. KAMPF:

As I recall, the same question was asked

22

in the Nyquist argument and I think the answer is less than

23

comforting since I am not sure that that hypothetical exists.

24

Nevertheless, ultimately, since there is no restriction on the

25

subsidy inherent in the statute, it runs into the same problem,
42

which is that it is capable of diversion to religious function.

ORAL ARUGUMENT OF WILLIAM I. KAMPF

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. KAMPF:

Speaking of the deductions, I should point

5

out that the table, which is appended to the State's brief, has

6

an anaylsis of the number of returns by amount of deduction

appended to it and that a clear reading of that same table, as
we indicated in Footnote Three of our reply brief, indicates
that the greatest proportion of the dollars deducted was in the
higher dollar ranges, thereby benefiting, quite obviously,
tuition.
There were, as Mr. Justice Stevens indicated, a large
number of returns taking small numbers of tuitions, tuition
deductions.

This is quite clearly analogous to the Wolman

decision where the Court sorted amongst kind of aid as in Meek
and disallowed some and allowed others.

The tuition deduction

itself must clearly fall because it is a benefit to the religious
institutions.

It is a subsidy.

QUESTION:

Mr. Kampf, under the Lemon test, as I

recall, the question is whether or not there is a primary effect
that benefits or furthers an establishment of religion.

Would

you tell us exactly what benefit an establishment of religion
has experienced under this statute and then compare it with the
benefit the state itself has enjoyed as a result of helping to
support private schools?

QUESTION:
MR. KAMPF:

I believe —
Which one?
The fact that there has been an increase

in students at religious schools while there has been a decrease
in students at public schools can lead one to that conclusion.
QUESTION:

But, counsel — Your friend on the other

side says that there has been a decrease since '56.
MR. KAMPF:

But, that was before the large increase

in this statute which resulted after this Court's decision in
