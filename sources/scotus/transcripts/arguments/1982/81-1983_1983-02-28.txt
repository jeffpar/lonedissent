Sr. Garvey, you may proceed whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. GARVEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

9

We will hear argument

SR. GARVEY:

Sr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court, the issue in this case is the validity of

10

regulations governing claims under the Social Security

11

Act for disability in cases that can't be decided on the

12

basis of medical evidence alone.

13

In 1979, the respondent who was then 51 years

14

old applied for disability benefits under Title II

15

claiming a back problem and high blood pressure.

16

QUESTION:

Total impairment?

17

MR. GARVEY:

18

She had been born in Panama where she was

I believe so.

19

educated through the sixth grade, and moved to the

20

United States in 1964.

21

of filing her claim, she had worked as a maid in a hotel

22

and as a seamstress and had injured her back moving a

23

laundry truck.

24
25

Between that time and the time

Her claim was denied initially and on
reconsideration by the State agency, and she then

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge.

2

The Administrative Law Judge took evidence on her

3

medical claims, on her back impairment and her other

4

claims, and concluded that she was capable of doing

5

light work as that term is defined in the regulations

6

which are at issue in this case.

7

The Administrative Law Judge also took

8

evidence on respondent's age and education, and on her

9

work experience and training, and after consulting the

10

guidelines in Appendix 2 of the regulations, concluded

11

that she was not disabled.

12

The respondent then sought review in the

13

District Court which upheld the Secretary's

14

determinations and respondent then appealed to the

15

Second Circuit which reversed.

16

The Second Circuit held that in cases which

17

can't be decided on the basis of medical evidence alone

18

where the claimant is incapable of doing her prior work,

19

the Secretary is required to show two things in order to

20

find the claimant not disabled.

21

The first thing the court said the Secretary

22

must demonstrate is what the claimant can do, that is to

23

say, what kinds of physical activities like lifting and

24

walking, and what sort of skills she may have acquired

25

in her past work.

With respect to that issue, the Court

U

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of Appeals concluded that the Secretary's determination

2

that respondent was capable of doing light work was

3

supported by substantial evidence.
The Court of Appeals said that the Secretary

4
5

must also introduce evidence on a second question.

6

Court said that the Secretary must show what kinds of

7

jobs are available for a person who is capable of doing

8

what the claimant is capable of doing.
QUESTION;

9

The

Mr. Garvey, do you interpret the

10

Court of Appeals' decision as perhaps being based on

11

some kind of due process, lack of notice requirement?
MR. GARVEY;

12

I find it difficult to understand

13

the Court of Appeals as having said that, because it

14

made no mention of tha due process clause.

15

contends that the Court of Appeals was concerned about

16

giving notice to claimants of the issues which are at

17

stake in disability hearings.

18

the Court of Appeals to have done something more radical

19

than that.
QUESTION;

of notice, what other requirement would there be?

QUESTION;

2

-- as far as this Court is

concerned?
NR. GARVEY;

3

There is a statutory requirement

4

of notice in Section 205(b) of the Social Security Act

5

that provides that the Secretary must crive notice and

6

reasonable opportunity for a hearing, and the Secretary

7

has in fact implemented that notice requirement by

8

regulations, and there are a couple in particular.
In 20 CFR 404.938, the Secretary has provided

10

that notice of a hearing will be mailed or served at

11

least ten days before the hearing.

12

statement of the specific issues to be decided and tell

13

you that you may designate a person to represent you

14

during the proceedings.

It will contain a

The regulations then go on to provide that

15
16

once the hearing has begun, the Administrative Law Judge

17

may consider a new issue at the hearing, that is to say,

18

an issue not raised at the initial or reconsideration

19

stage.
QUESTION;

20

Mr. Garvey, the Court of Appeals

21

didn't mention that section that you have just quoted at

22

all .

23

MR. GARVEY;

24

QUESTION;

25

No, it did not.
As I understand it, we have a

statute here and we have regulations issued pursuant to

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the Secretary's authority under 405(a), and the Court of

2

Appeals could decile against the Secretary in this case

3

only if it either decided that the regulation wasn’t

4

authorized by the statute or that the statute had some

5

sort of constitutional infirmity in it.

6

7
8

9
10

MR. GARVEY;

That is the Secretary's

contention in this case, that is correct.
QUESTION;

What do you understand to have been

the reasoning of the Court of Appeals, if it had any?
MR. GARVEY;

As I understand the Court of

11

Appeals, what it was concerned about was that the

12

Secretary had not complied with the procedures which the

13

Courts had used to interpret the statutory term before

14

these regulations had been passed.

15

Eefore the regulations were enacted, at

16

disability hearings, the statute provided that where the

17

case can't be decided on the basis of medical evidence

18

alone, the Secretary was required to consider, under

19

Section 223, the claimant's age, education, and work,

20

experience.

21

That job of considering those vocational

22

factors, along with the claimant's medical impairment,

23

in order to decide what kinds of jobs are available for

24

the claimant, had been performed largely with the

25

assistance of vocational experts. -

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

These were people who were rehabilitation

1

2

counsellors or directors of employment agencies, and

3

under contract with the Social Security Administration.

4

They would take the stand, after all of the evidence

5

about the claimant's medical factors and vocational

6

characteristics had been taken, and would be asked

7

hypothetical questions by the Administrative Law Judge

8

about what sorts of jobs would be available for such a

9

claimant if the Court determined that he was able of

10

doing light work.

11

The Court of Appeals, as I understand it, said

12

in this case that the Secretary was required to continue

13

to do that in order to give the claimant an opportunity

14

to dispute the suitability and the availability of the

15

jobs that were noticed.
I think the Court *s decision is very much

16
17

like, in fact I think it is identical to claims raised

18

under 405(g) decided by the First, Third, Fifth,

19

Seventh, and 11th Circuits.

20

what the claimant contended was that the Secretary's

21

decision wasn’t supported by substantial evidence if the

22

Secretary didn't put on evidence about what kinds of

23

jobs were out there that were suitable for a claimant of

24

this sort.

25

QUESTION

In each of those cases,

Is this a substantial evidence case

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 <202) 554-2345

1

for us, than?
Your cert petition treats it as though the

2

3

Court had invalidated the grid system in some kind of

4

regulations promulgated by the Secretary, and yet the

5

Court didn’t expressly do that.

6

then, that it really is a case of sufficiency of the

7

evidence?

Are you telling us,

8

MR. GARVEYs

No, it is not.

9

You will notice in the Court of Appeals’

10

opinion that at page 7-A it says, on the question of

11

what this claimant can do, the record as a whole

12

supports the Administrative Law Judge’s finding that Ms.

13

Campbell had the residual functional capacity to perform

14

light work.
Then the Court goes on to say that there is a

15
16

second question which must be decided, that is to say,

17

what kinds of jobs are out there and what their demands

18

are.

19

Secretary’s decision was not supported by substantial

20

evidence because he had not introduced any evidence on

21

that question.

22

With respect to that, the Court said the

But what the Secretary contends in this Court

23

is that it is unnecessary for him to introduce any

24

evidence on that question because the issue has already

25

been resolved by the regulations.

system is evidence.

Maybe you are arguing that the grid

MB. GARVEY;

3

But it is evidence only in the

4

sense in which any kind of regulation is evidence.

5

the tables and the guidelines actually do is to make

6

unnecessary the introduction of evidence on what kinds

7

of jobs.

8
9

QUESTIONi

What

It really dispenses with the need

for this sort of a proof that the Court of Appeals

10

thought was required .

11

MR. GARVEY;

That is correct.

What the

12

Secretary concluded was that those issues are really

13

legislative facts most appropriately determined in the

14

course of rulemaking proceedings.

15

conclusion corresponds to what this Court said in

16

Matthews against Eldridge.

17

I might add that that

What the Court there said was, resolution of

18

the inquiry as to the types of employment opportunities

19

that exist in the national economy for a physically

20

impaired worker with a particular set of skills would

21

not necessarily be advanced by an evidentiary hearing.

22

Then the Court went on to quote a passage from Professor

23

Davis's treatise dealing with legislative facts.

24
25

Then the Court concluded that the statistical
information relevant to this judgment is more amenable

to written than to oral presentation.
QUESTION;

At the top of page 9-A of the

3

opinion, is it possible that that material where the

4

Court refers to the fact that before and af'ter these

5

guidelines that the Court of Appeals had had some pretty

6

specific notions as to what the standard should be.

7

Does that suggest that they perhaps are not giving

8

enough weight to the guidelines?

9

}?R. GARVEY;

I think that is exactly correct.

10

At the top of 9-A what the Court says is that in future

11

cases, in past — before and after adoption of the

12

guidelines, this Court has required

13

identify specific alternative occupations, supported by

14

a job description clarifying the nature of the job and

15

demonstrating that the job does not require exertion or

16

skills not possessed by the claimant.

17

goes on to say that in the past this has been done

18

largely through the use of vocational testimony.

19

the Secretary to

The Court then

Then the Court says at the top of page 10-A

20

that if the Secretary is going to dispense with the use

21

of vocational experts, what he has got to do is provide

22

a similar degree of specificity, and concludes "the key

23

consideration in the administrative proceeding must be

24

that the claimant be given adequate opportunity to

25

challenge the suitability or availability of the jobs

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

noticed
If the Secretary is in fact required to do

2

3

that, then the regulations are effectively useless,

4

because --

5

QUESTION:

Is there anything in the

6

regulations that deals with the burden of proof and this

7

possible shifting of the burden of proof here?

8

9

MR. GARVEY;

Shat the regulations say is that

in cases which are specifically described by the

10

guidelines, by the tables in Appendix 2, that under

11

those circumstances if the findings of fact are the same

12

as the rule, we use that rule to decide whether a person

13

is disabled.

14

On the question of burden of proof with

15

respect to the suitability or availability of jobs for

16

people who meet the requirements in the tables, the

17

question of burden of proof is irrelevant for the same

18

reason as the substantial evidence question is

19

irrelevant, because that issue about whether such jobs

20

are available is no longer litigated in these

21

proceedings.

22

It has been decided by rulemaking.

I should add that with respect to all of the

23

facts that are unique to any given claimant with respect

24

to the claimant's medical condition, physical

25

impairments, mental impairments, the claimant's age,

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

what kind of training the claimant has, what kind of

2

education she has got, what work she has done in the

3

past, on all of those questions, once the disability

4

inquiry reaches the last stage, the Secretary still

5

maintains or still shoulders the burden of proof showing

6

that the claimant is capable of engaging in activity,

7

all of that notwithstanding, and the regulations

8

specifically provide that all of those issues are open

9

to rebuttal at the hearing.
It might be useful for me just to describe

10

11

briefly the reason for adopting these regulations and

12

say a few words about the way they work, and then say a

13

little bit more about what it was that the Secretary

14

believes the Court of Appeals decided.

15

Until 1978, before these regulations were

16

adopted, indeed today, most disability cases can be

17

decided on the basis of medical evidence alone.

18

either show that the claimant is so impaired that she is

19

unable to do any work regardless of what her vocational

20

characteristics are, or it will show that the claimant's

21

impairment is not sufficiently severe to warrant further

22

inquiry.

23

It will

In cases which can't be decided simply on the

24

basis of medical evidence, the promuloation of the

25

regulations was designed to displace the use of

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

vocational experts at hearings in determining the

2

question of what kinds of jobs were available and

3

suitable for claimants who are described by the

4

regulations.

5

The general theme of the regulations is this:

6

For claimants whose impairments are not sufficiently

7

severe to warrant the conclusion of the question right

8

there, among people who have similar impairments, what

9

the regulations do is to say that the older you are, the

10

more likely it is that you will be impaired, that you

11

will be disabled.

12

the less training you have, for people who have similar

13

impairments, the ones who are less educated, less

14

well-trained, have no skills, it is those people who

15

have an easier time proving disability under the

16

regulations which are at stake in this case.

17

Or, the less education you have, or

What the tables -- At the conclusion in

18

Appendix 2, what those tables do is to classify jobs

19

according to their gross physical demands.

20

the table that deals with light work in this case

21

assumes that people who are able to do light work are

22

able to undertake such activities as carrying more than

23

ten pounds frequently, and occasionally 20 pounds, that

24

they are able to do a good deal of walking or standing

25

or, if the job involves sitting, they are able to do

For example,

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

such things as pushing or pulling of arm and leg

2

controls.

3

For people whose impairment is only of that

4

sort, only in the kinds of gross physical demands of

5

which the tables take notice, the Secretary has said

6

that for those who are capable of doing light work, that

7

there are some 1600 jobs, different types of occupations

8

in the national economy, which can be performed by

9

people of that sort.

These are simple jobs that anybody

10

can learn to do in less than 30 days.

11

like —

12

QUESTIONS

They are jobs

Well, suppose one of the things

13

that the tables say is that light work includes the

14

ability to lift up to 20 pounds or 15, whatever it is,

15

may the claimant dispute whether or not he or she in

16

fact may lift up to 15 pounds?

17

HR. GARVEY;

Indeed.

In fact, the respondent

18

in this case disputed that she was unable to lift 20

19

pounds on at least two occasions.

20

introduced evidence from her doctor, Dr. Lowenthal, on a

21

form which the Social Security Administration has

22

designed to address just that question, the Joint

23

Appendix on page 32.

QUESTION:

At her hearing, she

testifies, "No, I can’t lift more than ten pounds.”

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

What then must the ALJ do when the table says that if

2

you are capable of doing light work and must lift up to

3

15?

4

no, she can't do light work?

Does this necessarily require a determination that

MR. GARVEY:

5

No, not necessarily.

What

6

happens is what has always happened in these disability

7

cases, the Administrative Law Judge considers her

evidence along with the contrary evidence which is

introduced --

NR. GARVEY:

— and makes a finding with

respect to how many pounds she is able to lift.
Had the Administrative Law Judge in this case

13
14

concluded that she was not capable of lifting that

15

weight, then he wouldn't have been able to apply Table

16

2.

17

Table 1 which would have determined that she was

18

disabled in this case.

19

He would have been required, at a minimum, to apply

QUESTION:

Of course, in advance of the

20

hearing, does she get any kind of notice to indicate

21

that one of the issues will be whether she can or cannot

22

lift 15 pounds?

23

MR. GARVEY:

The notice which she gets in

24

advance of the hearing appears in the administrative

25

record, and it says that "the issues at your hearing

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

will be how severe your impairment is.

2

must be so severe as to prevent you from not only not

3

engaging in your usual work, but considering your age,

education and work experience, prevent you from engaging

5

in any other kind of substantial gainful work."

QUESTION;

Excuse me, Hr. Garvey.

If she

11

doesn't get a copy of the guidelines, how does she know

12

the issue of whether she can lift 15 pounds or not will

13

arise at the hearing?

HR. GARVEY;

She is told that the guidelines

will apply.
QUESTION;

How does she get access to the

HR. GARVEY;

The guidelines are available at

Social Security Administration Branch offices.

20

also told at the beginning of the hearing, as she was in

Now I gather she is entitled to

assistance with a counsel, is she not, if she wants to

8

MR. GARVEY;

9

QUESTION*

10

But if she does not bring someone,

none is provided for her?
HR. GARVEY*

11

12

Yes, she is.

That's correct, although it is

important to emphasize that the Administrative Law Judge

3

at these hearings does not represent the Secretary.

4

Administrative Law Judge is charged under the

5

regulations with fully bringing out both the claimant's

6

side of the case and the Secretary's side of the case.
We think that the transcript of the hearing in

7

this case in fact demonstrates the Administrative Law

characteristics which are made relevant by the tables.

When was this particular party told

can lift 15 pounds?
MR. GARVEY;

9

She was not told that she would

be measured at any time.

10

QUESTION;

She was never told?

11

MR. GARVEY;

12

She was told that she would be measured by how

No.

13

much she could lift, whether she could lift weight, and

14

she testified that she was unable to lift anything.

15

introduced a form which her doctor had given her saying

that she was unable to lift more than ten pounds.

So it

As you stress, it's appropriate, in fact

20

perhaps desirable, for the Administrative Law Judge to

21

bring to the claimant’s attention that the question at

22

diability hearings is what you can lift, what you can

23

carry, how far you can walk, how long you can stand.

25

The Office of Hearings and Appeals has
designed, in the training of Administrative Law Judges 9

and has circulate! a kind of manual which tells them how

2

they ought to conduct these hearings.

that are made by the Administrative Law Judge at the

4

beginning of this hearing on pages 36, 37, 38, and 39,

5

are taken almost verbatim from those instructions to

6

Administrative Law Judges about how to conduct the

7

hearing, about what to tell the claimant.
The Administrative Law Judge in this case, as

9

The statements

the manual provided, said that "What we are concerned

10

about is not only whether you can do your own job, but

11

whether you can do other jobs.

12

we want to know is what your age is, what education you

13

have, what

In deciding that, what

work experience you've got."
He then goes to say, we are also going to ask

14
15

whether you can do sedantary, or light or medium work.

16

In deciding that question, what we want to know is your

17

ability to walk, stand, sit, lift, push, pull or carry.

18

He told her all of those things at the beginning of her

19

hearing.

20

CUESTIONj

Kay I ask you a question?

21

Kaybe it is unrealistic with 1600 jobs that

22

are available for this physical impairment, but

23

supposing she was familiar with the regulation and she

24

wanted to prove that all the lobs in the category

25

required some skill, such as speaking English, or

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

reading, or something that she did not have, and

2

therefore, she couldn't perform any of them.

3

was successful in that kind of proof for some reason

4

other reason other than physical impairment, would she

5

then prevail?

6

MR. GARVEYi

Assume she

What she would then have

7

succeeded in proving was that that was the wrong table

8

to apply to her, or that for some reason the tables

9

didn't apply.

10

In cases where the claimant is unable to

11

perform these kinds of jobs because she can't see or

12

because she has difficulty hearing, or because she has

13

some problem with fine motor skills, arthritis in the

14

fingers, for example, or she's got epilepsy, or she's

15

got an allergy to dust and is unable to work outdoors,

16

in those kinds of cases the tables do not apply.

17

In those kinds of cases the regulations

18

specifically say, if you look at Section 200(e) of

19

Appendix 2 which appears on page 56-A, Section 200(e)(1)

20

says, in the evaluation of disability, where the

21

individual has solely a non-exertional type of

22

impairment -- that is sight, hearing, fine motor skills

23

-- the rules do not direct factual conclusions of

24

disabled or not disabled.

25

So all of the evidence which you mention would

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

be perfectly appropriate, and indeed that sort of

2

question is asked by the Administrative Lav Judge before

3

first deciiing vhether the tables can be applied at

4

all .
QUESTION

5

I am still not clear what happens

if she proves that even though he has correctly

described her physical condition, she can't perform any

of the 1600 jobs.
What happens in the proceeding?

Does she

win ?
MR. GARVEY:

I would suppose so.

I presume

12

that in that case what she would have proved is that the

13

kinds of occupations of which the Secretary took notice

14

in the rulemaking proceeding don't in fact exist.

15

she would have proved is that the regulations are

16

arbitrary and capricious in that case, but there is no --

17

QUESTION.*

What

I wouldn't necessarily think that

18

they would be arbitrary and capricious in all cases, it

19

is just that she has some particular incapacity for —

20

Of course, I admit, it is a hard case to assume, with

21

1600 jobs, presumably she ought to be able to perform

22

some of them.

23

But I suppose and the Second Circuit's view

24

is, they could forestall that by telling her -- the ALJ

25

merely has to tell her, here are 10 or 15 jobs that

It doesn't seem as though it would be a great

that it focuses on what is absolutely the most esoteric

Mrs. Campbell came to the hearing prepared to

discuss that issue, and as a matter of fact, she spent

most of her efforts at her hearing testifying to why she

could not perform the duties required by her former

occupations.

Campbell that he was going to deny benefits based on the

rule which required the finding that she could lift over

15 or over 20 pounds and that, therefore, she should

1

MR. NAZARIO;

Your Honor, but the problem is

2

that the regulations do not contain a list of the jobs,

3

and that's the problem.

4

the Secretary is assuming that a claimant who fits a

5

grid structure can perform, the claimant would have to

6

go to other more difficult and less available sources,

7

such as the Dictionary for Occupational Titles, and

8

several publications of several agencies.

9

In order to find out what jobs

So even if the claimant is told that her claim

10

will be decided under the medical and vocational

11

regulations, and that she should read those regulations,

12

assuming that the claimant can't understand the

13

regulations and can't travel to the District Office, the

14

claimant would not know what jobs the Secretary is

15

assuming that she or he can perform.

16

Your Honor was absolutely right earlier in

17

this argument when he said that the claimant should be

18

given an opportunity to testify about those factors

19

which limit the grid applicability, and the Secretary

20

stated in his argument that grids come into play only

21

where claimant has limitations in terms of his or her

22

ability to meet strength requirements.

23

They do not come into play if the claimant has

24

a significant non-exertional limitation.

If the

25

claimant has significant visual or auditory problems,

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

problems in terms of environmental conditions, if

2

inability to tolerate gases, fumes, anything, any

3

limitation that is not measured out in terms of strength

4

would limit the application of the grid to that

5

claimant.
In this case, Mrs. Campbell was not told that

6
7

she had to testify about these types of limitations

8

because they would be relevant in determining whether

9

the grid was applicable to her.

So that this record,

10

even less the evidence which was necessary for a

11

determination of whether the grid was applicable at all,

12

the determination by the Second Circuit that Mrs.

13

Campbell did not have an meaningful chance to present

14

her evidence because the Secretary had not given her

15

notice, I think is entitled to affirmance.

16

factual determination that is amply supported in the

17

record of this case.

mr.

I understand she tried to get

2

legal assistance but she was unable to because the

3

private attorneys which she contacted charged a sum

4

which was too high for her means at that time, and she

5

could not get the service of a free legal

6

representative.

MR. NAZARIO:

QUESTION;

18

MR. NAZARIO:

20

Your Honor, not until she

filed the case in the District Court.

14

19

No,

No, Your Honor.

That was a private attorney?
That was a private attorney.

I see.
That is correct, it was a

private attorney.
The Secretary argues in this case that Mrs.

21

Campbell had notice because, first of all, the

22

procedures for determining disability under the

23

regulations are spelled out in the regulations, and he

24

claims that this notice by regulation meets the

25

requirements of adequate notice.

QUESTION;

1

Is there any procedure under Social

2

Security to which the claimant could go to get

3

instruction on how to present a case like this?
XR. NAZARIO;

4

Not to my knowledge, Your

5

Honor.

6

would have is if the ALJ fulfills his duties under the

7

regulations and makes all the relevant questions at the

8

hearing, then the claimant would ideally be informed of

9

what the issues are, but certainly that did not happen

10
11

The ALJ -- The only recourse that the claimant

in this case.
QUESTION;

Is information available on the

12

procedures and requirements and the regulation at the

13

branch offices of the Social Security?

14

HR. NAZARIO;

I believe that a copy of the CFR

15

-- a copy of the regulations would be made available to

16

the claimant if the claimant goes to the office and

17

inquires about it.

18
19
20

QUESTION;

Yes, and presumably there would be

staff present to explain.
NR. NAZARIO;

That I do not know, Your Honor.

21

That I do not know.

But nothing in the record of this

22

case indicates that Hrs . Campbell was advised of the

23

availability of those regulations, and nothing in this

24

case indicates that all the claimants are advised of the

25

availability and importance of those regulations.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION;

1

Isn't she obligated to do a little

2

something for herself, if she is depending on benefits#

3

if she is trying to get benefits?
ME. NAZARIO:

4

Well, Your Honor, in this case I

5

think she did as much as she could, considering that she

6

had a sixth grade education, that she was unrepresented

7

at her hearing, and that she was misled by the

8

Secretary's initial denial of benefits.
QUESTION;

9
10

You don't think she could have been

expected to go to the district office?
MR. NAZARIO:

11

She did went to the District

12

Office, that's where she filed the initial claim for

13

benefits, that is where she filed the claim for

14

reconsideration of the original denial, and that is

15

where she filed the request for the hearing.
But when she filed the request for the

16
17

hearing, she wasn't informed of the availability of the

18

regulations.

19

tha t.

There is nothing in the record to indicate

20

QUESTION;

21

MR. NAZARIO:

22
23

But they were available there?
Presumably they were available,

but she was not informed of their availability.
QUESTION;

Mr. Nazario, there is some

24

indication, is there not, that Congress has pressed the

25

Secretary to promulgate a grid system or regulations

38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

such as those that are employed here, is there not?

2

MR. NAZARIO;

3

QUESTIONS

Yes, Your Honor, there is.

Basically, the Secretary in

4

promulgating this system is carrying out the wishes of

5

Congress; is that right?

6

MR. NAZARIO:

Yes, Your Honor, that is right.

7

But what is at issue in this case, again, is not whether

8

the Secretary has the authority to promulgate this

9

regulation.

10

11

The issue in this case is whether the

regulations were properly applied to Mrs. Campbell.
The issue in this case is whether the

12

Secretary met the requirements in his own regulations,

13

where the Secretary failed his obligation to make sure

14

that the claimant presented all the relevant evidence

15

which is required prior to the application of the

16

medical and vocational regulations.

17

QUESTION;

The Court of Appeals certainly did

18

not state that the Secretary had failed to apply his own

19

regulation, did it?

20

MR. NAZARIO;

Well, the Court of Appeals did

21

not state that in so many words, but the holding of the

22

Court of Appeals is clear.

24

after she was adequately informed of what the issues of

25

the hearing were.

any other disability would also be considered?

Why

25

isn't that notice adequate under the regulations?

MR. NAZARIO:

1

Well, Your Honor, if the ALJ had

2

followed up on this statement, if the ALJ had made the

3

statement while Mrs. Campbell was testifying, then

4

probably Mrs. Campbell would have been able to present

5

her relevant evidence.

6

the ALJ at the beginning of the hearing when he was

7

explaining to Mrs. Campbell all the relevant procedures

8

-- all the relevant Social Security procedures.

But this statement was made by

He explained her appeals right.

9

He explained

10

her right to be represented.

He explained her right to

11

object to the medical evidence which had been

12

incorporated in the record.

13

this statement at the stage of the hearing where Mrs.

14

Campbell was testifying about her capacities.

He did not follow up on

15

In fact, if you look further down --

16

QUESTION:

Are you saying that if he had

17

repeated this statement while she was testifying, then

18

you really wouldn't have a case?

19

MR. NAZARIO:

If he had repeated this

20

statement in terms of questions, and if Mrs. Campbell

21

had been therefore able to put in evidence on each of

22

these factors, then Mrs. Campbell would have established

23

that she was disabled under the grid and, of course, she

24

would have had no need to appeal on the Secretary's

25

decision.

41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

If you look, at the record of the transcript

1

2

where vrs. Campbell is in fact testifying about her

3

capacities, that is only two pages in the transcript, it

4

appears on page — basically on page 50 and the first

5

half of page 51, she, for example, stated:

The ALJ instead

This record clearly establishes that Mrs.

24

Campbell did not put into the record the evidence which

25

was necessary for the determination of her claim under

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the grid, and that she did not present her evidence

2

because the Secretary never informed her of what it was

3

that she needed to prove.
I would like to clarify a statement by the

4
5

Court of Appeals which has been relied on by the

6

Secretary in his papers.

7

finding by the Court of Appeals that there was

8

substantial evidence to support the finding that Krs.

9

Campbell could perform light work is very important, and

The Secretary says that the

10

in fact shows that Mrs. Campbell was in — that Mrs.

11

Campbell's ability to work was properly considered by

12

the Secretary.
It should be pointed out that there are two

13
14

different purposes for judicial review in disability

15

determinations.

16

determination is supported by substantial evidence.

17

other one is whether the Secretary followed proper

18

procedures in determining the claimant's application for

19

benefits.

20

One is whether the Secretary's
The

By saying that considering whatever evidence

21

was already in the record of Mrs. Campbell's proceeding,

22

the determination that she could perform light work may

23

have found some support, the Secretary was not

24

sanctioning the way in which the ALJ arrived at that

25

determination.

43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

On several occasions the Second Circuit has

1

2

remanded cases to the Secretary despite finding the

3

determinations, the specific determination supported by

4

substantial evidence precisely because the claimant was

5

not given an opportunity to introduce contrary

6

evidence.
All that the Second Circuit did in this case

7

8

was to determine factually that Mrs. Campbell did not

9

have notice and did not have the opportunity to present

10

evidence.

That determination is amply supported by the

11

record of the case, and should be affirmed by this

12

Court.

13

to the Secretary that he has to give meaningful and

14

informative knowledge to Mrs. Campbell on the remanded

15

hearing is consistent with the Secretary's own

16

regulations, with the Secretary's own argument, and

17

should also be affirmed by this Court.

Furthermore, the determination — the direction

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. GARVEY, ESQ.,

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

23

MR. GARVEY:

I have a couple of brief points.

24

The first is with respect to the contention that the

25

respondent had no opportunity to put on evidence

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

regarding her non-exertional impairments.

2

Stevens pointed out, at the beginning of the hearing,

3

the ALJ informed respondent that any non-exertional

4

impairments that she might have would be issues in the

5

hearing.

6

notes we indicate the passages at which each of those

7

contentions was addressed.

8
9

As Justice

In our reply brief, at pages 11 to 14, in the

I should add that in those kinds of cases
where non-exertional impairments are present, then the

10

question is what kind of work somebody can do.

11

tables are not used, as I emphasized before.

12

happen in those kinds of cases most often is that the

13

Secretary will call a vocational expert to see what kind

14

of work is available for people who can do that.

15

The
What will

With the respect to the question of her

16

representation by counsel, I might just add a point

17

which does not appear in our brief.

18

Committee report, CP-9716, issued just in August of

19

indicates that, contrary to what Professor Davis thinks,

20

in disability cases, 71 percent of claimants are in fact

21

represented by counsel.

22

claimants who are not represented by counsel, the notice

23

which they receive in advance of hearing tells them, as

24

they told respondent in this case, that "The people at

25

your local Social Security Office will continue to

A Senate Finance
'82,

2

submit."
QUESTIONS

3
4

What does that mean, Mr. Garvey, as

a practial matter?
MS. GARVEY:

5

As a practical matter, what it

6

means is that they may go to the Social Security Office

7

and ask what kinds of evidence will help them to bolster

8

their claim.
QUESTION:

9
10

Are they told about the

guidelines?
MR. GARVEY:

11

They are told -- If they went to

12

the Social Security Office and inquired about the

13

guidelines, they would be told about the guidelines.

14

The Secretary does not resist telling claimants about

15

the guidelines.

16

informed by the ALJ that the regulations in Appendix 2

17

would be applied.
There is a notice — I am sorry, my time has
