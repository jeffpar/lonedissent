ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. ZINMAN, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN NO. 81-2386

MR. ZINMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.

8

The issue in this case is should this Court

9

apply the Maryland arbitral statute of 30 days or the

10

six-month statute of limitations contained in 10(b) of

11

the National Labor Relations Act or a longer statute of

12

limitations to this hybrid action.

13

hand, this Court applies the Maryland arbitral statute

14

to this hybrid action, the next issue would be whether

15

or not it should be applied prospectively or

16

retrospectively in this case.

17

If, on the other

The facts in this case are as follows*

Philip

18

Del Costello, the Petitioner in this case, was employed

19

by Anchor Motor Freight, the Respondent, as an

20

over-the-road truck driver at the time of his

21

termination on June 27, 1977.

22

a dissident member of PROD, a national Teamsters

23

organization and was engaged in a campaign of truck

24

safety several months preceeding his termination.

25

At that time he was also

On that date he was assigned to drive a truck

from Baltimore to Canada and during the course of his

2

inspections he found a number of safety defects with

respect to the truck.

drive the truck he refused, and he was terminated on the

5

spot.

When the company insisted that he

15

agent conducted no investigation into the facts which

16

preceded the termination, nor did the business agent

introduce any evidence and particularly it failed to

position that the truck was unsafe.

Costello claimed was not even there.

excluded, of course, the company would not have met its

25

burden of proof.

This was contrary

As a result of this hearing, the

Subsequent to that the business agent engaged

6

in a course of conduct which reasonably led Mr. Del

7

Costello to believe that he had yet to exhaust his

8

contract remedies and that the decision was not final

9

until December of 1977.

Several months thereafter, I

10

believe it was in March of 1978, Mr. Del Costello

11

initiated suit in the federal district court for the

12

district of Maryland.

13

Several months thereafter both Respondents

14

answered the suit.

15

the issue of limitations in its answer.

16

Motor Freight did raise the question of limitations it

17

did not specify which limitation period it had mind.

18

This was understandable at that time because the

19

Maryland arbitral statute by its own terms is expressly

20

inapplicable to labor disputes.

21

However, Local 557 never even raised
While Anchor

In any event, for the next 32 months during

22

which time the parties engaged in rather extensive

23

discovery, not one time did Anchor Motor Freight or

24

Local 557 ever raise the question of limitations until

25

they filed their motion for summary judgment in November

1

of 1980, one month after this Court granted certiorari

2

in Mitchell.

3

arbitral limitation statute of 30 days for all intents

4

and purposes the hybrid cause of action is destroyed.

5

We contend that if this Court applies the

I say that because most of these arbitration

6

statutes were initially passed by the state legislatures

7

to apply to commercial disputes and in commercial

8

disputes from the arbitrator to the courts the parties

9

are usually represented by the same counsel.

And it is

10

a matter of smoothly shifting gears from the arbitrator

11

to the court in terms of the filing of appeal which in

12

that instance only takes hours to possibly one day.

13

The situation is entirely different with a

14

disconnected party such as Mr. Del Costello or anyone

15

having hybrid cause of action because he does not have

16

an attorney at the grievance procedure.

17

and in this case he was limited exclusively to his

18

representative, his union representative.

19

He is limited,

Moreover, unlike the arbitral proceeding where

20

there is an established and known record of law and

21

fact, the facts surrounding the malpractice not only are

22

not on the record but the business agent in most

23

instances does everything to hide those facts.

24

consequence, before the worker ever realizes that he has

25

a cause of action, 30 days has already passed and he is

out of court
But that is not the end of it.

Who does he

3

turn when he first realizes that he has been wronged.

4

He has to go to a lawyer and unfortunately those most

5

able to represent him in this field are either labor

6

lawyers representing management or labor lawyers

7

representing unions and due to the polorization of the

8

labor bar he ultimately finds that he has to turn to a

9

general practitioner such as he did in this case —

10

QUESTION*

Mr. Zinman, when you say

11

polarization, do you mean anything more than just

12

conflicts of interest?

13

MR. ZINMAN;

No, Your Honor, I am simply

14

saying that as a practical matter particularly even in a

15

larger city such as Baltimore lawyers who represent

16

unions and lawyers who represent companies will not take

17

these cases because they view the petitioner as somewhat

18

of a pariah.

19

In a broad sense I suggest it might well be a

20

self-perceived conflict of interest or rather technical

21

conflict of interest.

22

practitioner gets this kind of client he has to research

23

a brand new law and that takes time.

24
25

In any case when a general

After he researches the law and then
familiarizes himself not only with that but with the

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

customs and the practices and the contracts and the

2

constitutions and all of the other intricate matters, he

3

then has to decide to conduct a factual investigation to

4

determine frankly whether or not there is a prima facie

5

case.

6

all of that is done there is a matter of counsel fees

7

and costs because you must have reasonable cost in this

8

case to meet the well-dealed opponents who have no such

9

problems.

10

That takes a considerable period of time.

After

So I submit to the Court that this is probably

11

one of the most important reasons why it is totally

12

unfair to apply such a short statute of limitations of

13

even 30, 60 or 90 days.

14

I believe that even six months under these very

15

difficult circumstances is not enough.

16

In fact to be perfectly candid,

The unions and companies frequently make the

17

argument if any period of time longer than 30 days is

18

applied it will do violence to the policy of rapid

19

disposition of labor disputes which, of course, was the

20

principle enunciated in the Mitchell case several years

21

ago, and I suggest that this is not correct.

22

correct for two reasons.

23

It is not

First, in Mitchell this Court only had really

24

two options.

It had the option to select a three or

25

five year statute of limitations on one hand or a 90-day

g
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

limitation on the other.

It did not, as I read the

2

case, have the option of applying the six-month arbitral

3

limitation period contained in 10(b) as it does here.
But more important than that, I really do not

4
5

believe that there is an impirical evidence to suggest

6

that there is any danger posed to the notion of rapid

7

disposition or more particularly the law of the shop,

8

based upon the fact that if the statistics in the cert

9

petition of the Steelworkers is any indication that

10

there is any avalanche of cases now pending before the

11

district courts.

12

is 400 cases now pending before the district courts of

13

the United States, how does that pose as a threat to

14

rapid resolution of labor disputes.

They had 110, but assuming that there

Moreover, I will just close — Moreover, most

15
16

of these cases that are pending involve questions of

17

fact as to whether or not the agent properly

18

investigated the case of whether or not he was guilty of

19

committing an act of malice.

20

precedential cases in the whole scope of these cases

21

that are now pending, and given the high degree of proof

22

that is reguired to prove one of these cases, I doubt

23

very much if there is any particular threat to this

24

policy.

25

There are very few

So we submit to the Court that the most

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

appropriate statute of limitations would be 10(b).

2

my remaining time I would just submit that the closest

3

analogous limitation period would be 10(b) because 10(b)

4

in breach of duty of fair representation which was

5

contained within the hybrid cause of action was

6

judicially implicated from the National Labor Relations

7

Act.

8

that a breach of duty of fair representation is also an

9

unfair labor practice as is the conduct of the company

10

In

As such the courts have held on many occasions

in many cases.

11

But to the extent that it is not I refer the

12

Court to the observation of Justice Stewart that it is

13

sufficiently similar in character so as to be

14

encompassed by the National Labor Relations Act.

15

QUESTION;

Mr. Zinman, to get the benefit of

16

10(b), however, you still have to have a towing

17

somewhere don't you?
MR. ZINMAN;

18
19
20
21
22

Yes.

In this particular case we

do.
QUESTION;

So to win you have to have 10(b)

plus a towing?
MR. ZINMAN;

Yes, but we feel, Your Honor,

23

that that is a factual matter to be resolved by the

24

trier of fact.

25

facts and, of course, neither Respondent answered.

We filed an affidavit alleging those

They

which is really not before the Court.

the Court will apply the usual rule of construction of

out of our contentions.

11

Was this on motion for summary

We assume that

Pardon?
Was this on motion for summary

j ulgment?
MR. ZINMAN;

Yes, sir.

It was on motion for

12

summary judgment, and that is the posture of the case at

13

the present time so that all this Court would do

14

obviously is return the case to the district court on

15

remand if it found in our favor.

16

Finally, I would just conclude by stating that

17

we feel also that if the Court does decide that the

18

arbitral limitations is applicable that we suggest that

19

it should be held prospectively rather than

20

retrospectively because there was a reasonable reliance

21

and the best evidence of our reasonable reliance is the

22

conduct of the Respondents in not raising this question

23

of limitations for 32 months.

24

Thank you.

MR. WEINBERG;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;

facts of Flowers very simply.

The Plaintiffs in this

They took their grievance to the union.

10

The union processed the grievance through all four steps

As to the case against the union, however, the

court below ruled that the New York statute of

In your case it is just the union

HR. WEINBERG:

Just the union.

5

QUESTION;

6

HR. WEINBERG;

7

We challenge the decision below on two

-- not the employer.
That is correct.

8

grounds.

First we urge that the six-month period in

9

section 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act be the

10

statute to govern duty of fair representation suits

11

against unions.
Second, in the alternative if state law

12
13

governs we would urge that the 90-day New York statute

14

governing suits to vacate arbitration awards be applied

15

in the case against the union as it was in the case

16

against the employer.

17

the 10(b) issue, first.

Let me take our primary position,

The starting point, we believe, is that this

18
19

duty of fair representation cause of action is a federal

20

cause of action.

21

statute.

22

23

bargaining status upon majority unions.

It was implied from section 9 of the National

24

The question of what statute of limitations

25

governs a federal statute is a federal question to be

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

determined by construing that statute.

2

Congress enacts an express cause of action but does not

3

provide a statute of limitations, it is a fair inference

4

that Congress intended that a state limitations period

5

would apply.

6

presumes that Congress intended there be some

7

limitations period and the state law in most cases

8

provides the most likely if not the only source for such

9

a statute.

Generally, where

That is so because in the normal case one

But we submit that in that case that inference

10
11

makes no sense.

As both Justice Stevens and Justice

12

Stewart in their respective opinions in Mitchell, the

13

Congress in

14

that this Court would come along later and imply a

15

judicial duty of fair representation cause of action.

1947 when it enacted the NLRA was not aware

In that circumstance, the silence of Congress

16
17

on the statute of limitations question cannot signify an

18

intent that state law apply.

19

intent that any particular statute of limitations apply.
QUESTION:

20

It cannot signify an

Well, Mr. Weinberg, do you think

21

the silence of the Congress in the many other kinds of

22

federal causes of action where state statutes have been

23

implied was taken to mean that state law was intended by

24

Congress?

25

That was really the only place to turn.
MR. WEINBERG:

I think it is both of those.

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Well, what happened is I think, you had -- In the outset

2

I think the question was what is the statute of

3

limitations and the only place to turn was state law.

4

Over time I think you had that factor combined with the

5

factor that this Court had been consistently saying

6

state statutes of limitations should govern and,

7

therefore, when Congress did not put a statute in there

8

that added weight to that inference.

9

But you cannot have an inference if Congress

10

was not aware at the time it was creating the cause of

11

action.

12

here, and it seems to us that in that circumstance what

13

you have got to do is you have got to go back to the Act

14

and look at the structure and policy of the Act, the Act

15

that gives rise to the cause of action.

16

That is the circumstance we find ourselves in

It is our view that when you do that here you

17

get substantial guidance on this question because in

18

section 10(b) of that very Act Congress expressly

19

adopted a limitations period that strikes a balance

20

between the very same complex of employee, employer, and

21

union rights that is involved in the judicial duty of

22

fair representation action.

23

As this Court found in Machinists, 10(b)

24

reflects Congress*

judgment as to the proper balance

25

between the interests of employees and the overriding

16

1

interest of the Act and industrial peace

2

Court's word the objective of 10(b) was stability of

3

bargaining relationships.

4

In the

That very same tension exists in the duty of

5

fair representation context, the tension between

6

individual rights and the functioning of the private

7

system of decision making that the NLEA was intended to

8

foster.

9

grievance arbitration process is a critical part of that

As this Court recognized in Mitchell, the

10

private decision making system.

Unlike in the

11

commercial context where arbitration is a substitute for

12

litigation, in the labor context arbitration serves as a

13

continuing process by which the law of the shop is

14

developed.
The duty of fair representation action is a

15
16

challenge to a decision arrived at through that process,

17

a decision that the parties to that process, the union

18

and the employer, are perfectly prepared to live by.

19

The thrust of duty of fair representation action is that

20

that system of decision making malfunctions.

21

the duty of fair representation suit may be brought, the

22

parties cannot regard the matter as finally settled, and

23

they cannot rely on it in their future dealings with one

24

another.

25

As long as

The Court expressed this point in Mitchell and

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

if I may quote from the Court's opinion, "This sytem

2

with its heavy emphasis on grievance, arbitration and

3

the law of the shop could easily become unworkable if a

4

decision which is given meaning and content to the terms

5

of an agreement that even effected subsequent

6

modifications of the agreement could certainly be called

7

into question as much as six years later."

8

went on to point to the "undesirability of the results

9

of the grievance and arbitral process being suspended in

10

The Court

limbo for long periods."
The six-month period in 10(b) was intended to

11
12

provide a definitive end to just such situations of

13

uncertainty.

14

issue that the duty of fair representation is an

15

intrical part of the complex of employee, union, and

16

employer rights embodied in the national labor policy.

It is our view in sum as to the 10(b)

Mr. Groner .

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS IN NO. 81-2406
MR. GRONER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
Respondents Flower and Jones are before the

20

Court to request affirmance of the judgment below which

21

held that the appropriate statute of limitations was

22

that applicable to non-medical malpractice.

23

judgment should be affirmed essentially for two reasons.

24
25

That

One, the substance and purpose of the duty of
fair representation clearly makes the most analogous

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

state statute of limitations that applicable to legal

2

malpractice, and secondly, that the decisions of this

3

Court and the law that has been established with respect

4

to statutes of limitations would require that the

5

statute of limitation to be applied in a duty of fair

6

representation case against the union be the most

7

analogous state statute of limitations.

8
9

With respect to the substance and purpose of
the duty of fair representation from the beginning of

10

its statement in the Steel case throughout every

11

discussion of it, that duty has consisted of a

12

correlative duty which arises from the right of the

13

union to represent all of the employees in the

14

bargaining unit, and the correlative duty is to

15

represent each and all of the employees without

16

discrimination, to represent them fairly.

17

In the Steel case the analogy was made to a

18

legislature.

It was held that the right to represent

19

all the employees in the bargaining unit was analogous

20

to the right of the legislature to pass laws which were

21

applicable to all the citizens and that if there were no

22

duty that that right be exercised in a fair way,

23

constitutional questions might even arise so that we are

24

concerned in the duty of fair representation with

25

questions of fair treatment that may rise to the stature

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

of constitutional questions
What we have and what the Court has repeatedly-

3

held is that the supreme and basic value in a duty of

4

fair representation is protection for the individual.

5

It is to ensure that the individual employee will not be

6

the victim of unfair treatment, that the duty of fair

7

representation was not only established in the first

8

place, but has consistently been recognized and enforced

9

by this Court.

10

It is a representational duty.

In speaking of

11

representational duties and in asking what is the

12

appropriate analogy to a representational duty we would

13

suggest that the immediate answer that occurs is that of

14

the relationship between an attorney and a client.

we have a situation — As a practical matter, we may

2

have a situation where to enforce the same statute of

3

limitations against the union as has been enforced

4

against the employer would be to deprive that individual

But there had been a violation of the contract, the kind

15

of holding that Your Honors just a few months ago in the

This Court held that it was a matter of

14

the contrast between the lack of statute in 301 and the

presence of a definite statute of limitations in the

States creating causes of action that are very close to

in ultimate purpose of protecting the individuals to the

duty of fair representation.

When it passed the Labor Hanagement Relations

Act in 1959 and when in 1970 it passed the Postal Reform

8

Act, it established rights upon which it imposed no

statutes of limitations.

This Court has many times

10

pointed out the difference between the public

11

responsibilities of the National Labor Relations Board

12

and the private interest of individual plaintiffs in

13

these duties of fair representation action.

This Court has held that the paramount value

15

in terms of duty of fair representation is protection of

the rights of individual employees.

18

public purposes and the right of the individual to bring

19

a law suit according to the traditional law to have

20

21

legal redress.

22

A distinction has

This Court has held that even claims of

23

insubstantial values ought to be protected because it

24

was such a paramount purpose that individuals should be

25

protected from abuse from unfair treatment by their

2

you could have said that the cause of action was

3

likewise based upon the National Labor Relations Act

4

because how did the union get the opportunity and get

5

the right to speak for all of the employees and to bring

6

that action to enforce the contract.

7

Now, in Hoosier

It got it by virtue of its status under

8

section 9(a), the right to represent all employees and

9

sign the contract, and it got the right to bring that

10

action under section 301 which under the decisions of

11

this Court, of course, endowed courts with substantive

12

rights, the right to declare substantive law and is not

13

merely a procedural statute.

14

Likewise here the claim is a claim that is

15

based upon long standing legal principles of individuals

16

not to be unfairly treated by their representatives, and

17

that right not to be represented by the individuals is

18

not a right that is derived from section 9(a).

19

right of substantive law that is part of the 301 grant

20

of power by Congress and part of the rights that ought

21

to be taken into account in determining the appropriate

statute of limitations.

Let me make one point on the state law issue

2

where it is our position that if we get to the issue,

3

the arbitration statute should apply.

4

Mitchell said the malpractice analogy was inappropriate

5

in that case because the arbitrator's award stood

6

between the plaintiffs and the remedy they sought.

7

The Court in

That is true as well in the case of the

8

union.

As counsel for Respondents indicated, they have

9

to prove that there was a breach of contract and the

10

remedy they seek, a remedy under Bowen, is a remedy of

11

back wages which flows from a breach of contract.

12

as in the case against the employer, it is necessary

13

here if they want to make out their claim to prove that

14

the contract was breached which means you have got to

15

show that the arbitrator’s decision was erroneous.
