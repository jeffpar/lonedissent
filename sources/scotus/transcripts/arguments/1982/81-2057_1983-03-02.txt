ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

MR. GUIDO:
Guido, Jr.

Thank you, Your Honor.

My name is Kenneth J.

I represent the New Jersey Legislature and the

Democratic members of Congress in this case.
This case is an appeal from the judgment of a divided

12

three-judge district court in New Jersey, which struck down a

13

congressional reapportionment plan enacted by the New Jersey

14

legislature.

15

tionment plan for the election of United States House of Repre­

16

sentatives with a deviation that falls within the statistical

17

imprecision of the census data.

18

On January 19, 1982 New Jersey enacted a reappor­

The plan in accordance with the notification from the

19

Clerk of the House of Representatives based on the 1980 decennial

20

census data reduced the number of districts from 15 to 14.

21

plan as enacted creates 14 districts with an average population

22

deviation of 0.135 percent and a maximum deviation between the

23

smallest and largest districts of less than 0.7 of one percent.

24
25

The

numerical equality.

The leadership agreed that no plan would be

1

considered with deviations over one percent and that lesser

2

deviations would be sought.

3

Additional legislative criteria which was to be secondary

4

to population equality were to protect minority interests by not

5

unnecessarily diluting black votes particularly in the tenth or

6

the Newark district.

7

The others were to preserve the cores of existing

8

districts as much as possible for all members of the Legislature

9

and to preserve municipal boundaries, which, in New Jersey because

10

there are so many of them, are small enough to be building blocks

11

for reapportionment purposes.

12

Plaintiffs, including all of the incumbent Republican

13

members of Congress, on February 2nd and 9, 1982 brought suit

14

to declare this statute unconstitutional because they believed

15

other plans submitted to the Legislature would have reduced the

16

variation between districts to even lower levels than the 0.7 of

17

one percent in this case.

18

The cases were consolidated and submitted on depositions

19

affidavits, and exhibits without trial upon the agreement of all

20

parties to this action.

21

court by a divided vote declared the statute unconstitutional.

On March 3, 1982, the three-judge distric

22

The Court read Kirkpatrick and White, the decisions of

23

this Court, as requiring any legislatively drafted congressional

24

redistricting plan to be held unconstitutional if there existed

25

the possibility that a plan with a smaller deviation of census

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

population might be developed.

2

The Court concluded that such a possibility existed in

3

this case and struck down the statute.

4

failed to consider the problems undisputed in the record with

5

each of the plans rejected by the Legislature.

6

In doing so, the Court

The Court also gave little, if any, consideration to

7

other criteria such as preventing the dilution of minority voting

8

strength in certain districts.

9

racial dilution did not justify the deviations because the district

The Court concluded that preventing

10

with the largest black vote, District 10, was not one of those

11

with the highest deviation.

12

And, finally, the District Court rejected the Appellants'

13

argument that the as nearly as practicable standard of Kirkpatrick

14

and White is satisfied when the population deviation is even less

15

than the statistical imprecision of the census.

16

QUESTION:

Do we really know what the statistical

17

deviation is on variance from the census figures?

18

have anything to go by?

19

MR. GUIDO:

Do we really

What we have in this case is that we have

20

the statement of Dr. Trussell who is a demographer at Princeton —

21

an expert demographer — and a noted authority on the census.

22

fact, he participated in all of the studies that the census has.

23

He —

24
25

QUESTION:

In

It was my understanding, though, that there was i|io

real concensus, if you will, on what the most recent census variation
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

might be and if there is such a variation people have spoken in

2

national terms which would not necessarily focus it on that —

3

MR. GUIDO:

That is right.

Dr. Trussell is the only

4

one who has focused that on districts as small as congressional

5

districts or at the state level.

6

If I may return to my agrument —

The —

Circuit

7

Judge Gibbons dissented.

8

between the districts is less than the recognized margin of error

9

a good faith effort on the part of the Legislature to achieve

He concluded that where the deviation

10

numerical equality has been shown as a matter of law.

11

in such situations should not substitute their judgment for that

12

of the legislature.

13

And, courts

The Appellants on March 8 filed a notice of appeal and

14

applied for stay of the judgment pending appeal to this Court.

15

On March 15, Justice Brennan stayed the District Court's judgment.

16

As Justice Brennan recognized in granting Appellants' application

17

for a stay, the district of Newark presents the question whether

18

the proper interpretation of this — what are the proper inter­

19

pretations of the standards laid out in Kirkpatrick v. Preisler.

20

Do they require absolute equality, or do they allow for

21

some latitude given the arguable statistical insignificant variane as

22

argued in this case?

23

In this case, the essence of what we are arguing about

24

is whether a variance of less than 0.7 of one percent is not good

25

enough to satisfy the requirements of Kirkpatrick, Wesberry and

White.
QUESTION:

Mr. Guido, what does that 0.7 of one percent

translate into in terms of people?
MR. GUIDO:

In terms of people it translates into a

5

deviation of approximately, I think, 3,551 people between the

6

largest and the smallest.

7

figures that were in Wesberry, for example.

8

140 percent deviation or 551,000 people.

9
10
11

That is much different than in the
In Wesberry it was

In Kirkpatrick, the deviation was 5.97 percent, or
25,000 people.

In White, it was 4.13, or 19,275 people.

The deviations in this case are less than the deviations

12

in 11 other plans adopted in other states and fall within the

13

range of, I think, approximately five other states.

14

At the outset, I think it is important to focus on the

15

appropriate standard of review in this case, because the Appellees

16

here and two members of the District Court below interpreted the

17

standards of Kirkpatrick and White to mean that a redistricting

18

plan adopted by a state legislature is automatically unconstitu­

19

tional no matter how low a deviation it contains as long as it is

20

possible to conceive of a plan with a lower deviation.

21

This is true, they argue, no matter what flaws there

22

might be in the other plans, and no matter what the statistical

23

imprecision of the underlying census data may be.

24

this incongruous result, the Appellee has ignored the admonition

25

of this Court in White that from the beginning we have recognized

of this Court against the requirement of the primacy of the

legislature, this Court has evolved a pragmatic case-by-case

10

approach in litigating these issues.

11

In Wesberry, it said, "as nearly as is practicable,

12

one man's vote in a congressional district is worth as much as

13

another's."

14

Kirkpatrick rejected the fixed percentage formula.

15

And, in elaborating on this standard this Court in

Consequently, as this Court concluded in White,

16

congressional districts pass constitutional muster if they are

consideration.

And, on page 22 of our brief, note 17, we point

out that the Court in Mahan and in Burns v. Richardson recognized
that there may even be situations in which the census data does
not have to be used because of problems of accuracy.
The third factor the Court has looked to in determining
whether a plan meets constitutional muster is the extent to which
the challenged variances fall within the range of what other
states have done.

I have just pointed out to you where the

statute challenging this plan falls with regard to other states.
Additionally, the fourth factor has been the availability
of acceptable alternatives, which we will address in a minute, and
the extent to which there exists legitimate justifications for
the deviations.
■In all of: the case's that-this Court has decided" since
Baker v. Carr, it has never stricken a plan with a variance as
low as in this case.

As I said, the variances in this case are

no where near those of Wesberry, Kirkpatrick and White.
QUESTION:

But wasn't it the position of the Court that

there were other plans with a still smaller variation?
MR. GUIDO:

That is correct, Your Honor, but what, we wilL

address is the question of the inadequacies of those plans.

If

you wish me to address that now —
QUESTION:
MR. GUIDO:

I am patiently waiting.
While reviewing court drawn plans this Court

holds to a higher one vote-one man standard than legislatively drawn

plans, this court has upheld plans with similar deviations to that

plan challenged in this action out of deference to the legislature

standard.

QUESTION:

23

MR. GUIDO:

Is there proof to that effect in the record?
Pardon?
Is there proof to that effect in the record?
In the record, yes.

Dr. Trussell's state­

24

ment supports that and all of the attachments that are included

25

with that include all of the studies that have been done by the

Census Bureau on that issue.

And, yet, you structure your own apportion­

ment on the census figures?

5
6

They are all exhibits as attachments

MR. GUIDO:
Your Honor.

On the census figures, that is correct,

Since those were the only figures that were available

and the Legislature of New Jersey attempted to get as close to'
zero as possible, even in recognition that there was an error factbr
in those figures, and in recognition of the fact that there was
no way, as a practical matter, to make corrections for those
deviations.

So, what we are arguing here is even though that

cannot be done, this Court as a matter of constitutional law

13

should recognize that it should not require something to be done

14

by the Legislature that is essentially physically impossible.

15

They took the best available data that was available to them.

16
17
18
19
20
21

They used that data.

That data has imprecision and is now being

attacked because they did not come close enough to zero when, in
fact, no one knows that if we drew a plan that had absolutely
zero census population deviation that it would not be in reality
a plan with a substantially higher deviation than the 0.7 of
one percent that is in this case.

22

QUESTION:

Is there any finding by the District Court

23

that it did or did not credit Mr. Trussell — Dr. Trussell's

24

testimony?

MR. GUIDO:

Yes, that is my understanding.

Well, Your Honor, I am not certain of the

body of water.

10

QUESTION:

11

(Laughter)

12

MR. GUIDO:

I will ask Mr. Hellring.

The reality is that even if we drew the

13

district as square, you would still have to at certain times be

14

a yachtsman to cross it.

In all of these districts?
How many of them have genuine community of

2

interest either economic, social or political?
MR. GUIDO:

Well, Your Honor, it is my understanding

3

and Justice Brennan is probably much more familiar with it —

4

with the State of New Jersey than I am —

/

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. GUIDO:

Well, I think, in Kirkpatrick —
— but the basic goals in this case were to

7

maintain essentially the core districts from the 1970 census

8

and that that essentially reflected the communities of interest

9

at that time in recognition of the fact that there needed to be

10

changes because there was a loss of a district.

11

factors, Your Honor, I think, as I listed in the — at the

12

beginning, maintaining the core districts meant that there was

13

an attempt to preserve the communities of interest that had been

14

reflected in the 1970 reapportionment as drawn by the District

15

Court previous to that time.

Mr. Guido, is that green district that is

by Asbury Park and Long Branch, is that all one district?
MR. GUIDO:

This green district is all one district.

QUESTION:

But the same district isn't extended up to

the light green north of the body of water?

21

MR. GUIDO:

22

QUESTION:

There are numbers on that.

23

QUESTION:

Yes, but I cannot see the numbers.

24

QUESTION:

Number eight is the one.

25

MR. GUIDO:

It is different than this —

This here is all one district.
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. GUIDO:

Thank you.
And essentially one of the things I think

3

you have to understand is if you look back at the appendix, you

4

look at this map and you say, well you look at these districts

5

and they have these sort of puzzle kind of shapes.

6

is that in New Jersey the building blocks that were used were

7

municipalities because of the community of interest concern and

8

in putting together those building blocks in such a way.

The reality

9

There were sufficient numbers of them so that you could

10

satisfy that population equality requirement and as a consequence

11

because you use those boundaries you end up with a map that looks

12

like this.

13

that had been drawn over time in New Jersey and I can tell you

14

that if anyone thinks that this is a strange map, there have

15

always been strange maps in this regard in New Jersey, primarily

16

because municipalities were used as the building blocks; two, is

17

that you have a state with an irregular shape; and three, with a

18

very high population.

19

map that —

20
21

At one time I went back and looked at all of the maps

QUESTION:

So as a consequence, you end up with a

Did Kirkpatrick say that community of

interest was relevant at all in cases of this kind?

22

MR. GUIDO:

In Kirkpatrick, no it did not, Your Honor.

23

In fact, we are not even arguing that communities of interest is

24

relevant.

25

statistical imprecision of the census data was such that it

What we are arguing here is that essentially the

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

justifies holding that this plan was the functional equivalent

2

of zero, and we are arguing that if the minute deviation in this

3

case is not justified by an acceptance of the statistical impre­

4

cision, that the concern for the minority interest is sufficient

5

to justify that deviation.

6
7

QUESTION:

But Judge Gibbons said that minority interest

was pretextural in this case, didn't he?

8
9

We are arguing —

MR. GUIDO:

Your Honor, what the Court said in this

case about the minority interest was that essentially there was

10

no connection — they could not find a linear connection between

11

the tenth district and the fourth district that concerns the

12

minority interest was affected and the deviations that were in

13

this case.

14

As a practical matter, when you look at this map, it

15

is impossible after the fact to construct the cause or connection

16

between minority interest and the interest here.

17

that you can do to make a judgment about whether the Legislature

18

appropriately took into consideration minority interest was

19

whether the plan that was adopted by the Legislature better met

20

the minority concerns than the other plans before the Legislature.

21

The only thing

As we have argued in our brief, we have demonstrated

22

that the plans that were relied upon by the District Court, two

23

of which did not even exist at the time that the statute challengejd

24

in this case was adopted, did not meet the interest of minority

25

interest and that Mayor Gibson who was the major minority leader
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

in the state was actively lobbying for the statute passed in this

2

case and actively lobbying with the legislators against this

3

plan, and, in fact, no plan would have been adopted without the

4

vote of minority members of the Legislature, and it was this plan

5

that they felt best represented their interests.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Guido,

I want to be sure about one

7

thing — I believe Justice Powell referred to it — all three

8

members of the panel below agreed on the pretextural aspect of

9

the preservation of minority —

10
11

MR. GUIDO:

All three members on the panel below rejected

the argument.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. GUIDO:

All three agreed it was pretextural?
I remember one of them using the word

14

pretextural, Your Honor, but I would concede that point for

15

purposes of the argument, and that the basis that they did say

16

was is that they said no one could develop a linear connection

17

between the deviations and the concern for minority voting

18

strength in this case.

19

believe that that conclusion that there was a requirement that

20

in a reapportionment case especially with the deviation of 0.7

21

of one percent is a requirement that leaves no deference to the

22

Legislature as required by this Court in Upham and in White.

23

Yes, Your Honor, that — And, that we

And, if there is to be any deference to the Legislature

24

the test should be, take a look at the plans that were before

25

the Legislature and compare those to the plan that is before
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

that is being challenged to decide whether or not that interest

2

was adequately —

3

QUESTION:

May I ask one question about the lack of

4

compactness of the districts that Justice Powell aluded to with

5

District 3, I guess it is.

6

As I remember the Rutgers professor's submission, he included

7

compactness as one of the tests of whether the plan was a satis­

8

factory one.

9

any attention at all to the desirability of compact districts?

10

It is kind of irregularly shaped.

Did the Legislature in this drafting this plan give

MR. GUIDO:

No, what the concern was here was, as I

11

pointed out at the outset —

12

QUESTION:

13

Did they include —

14

MR. GUIDO:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. GUIDO:

Well, I understand there were other concerns.

Did they include compactness —
— that as of any value at all to that?

Court:
In striking down the statute which is represented by
this exhibit which was received in evidence by the District
Court, the Court below said that since there were a number of

22

other plans available to the Legislature including several which

23

had been introduced as bills which had smaller population

24

deviations, and since this redistricting statute was not the

25

unavoidable result of a good faith effort to arrive at the
19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

smallest deviations in population, and since the record contained

2

no justification for the population deviation contained in this

3

statute, that it must be declared unconstitutional under the

4

principles enunciated by this Court in Wesberry and its progeny

5

Kirkpatrick and White.

6

The record contains no suggestion of any good faith

7

effort or indeed any effort to consider other plans with smaller

8

population deviations.

9

was made up later after the suit

There was a justification argued which
was started in which it was

10

suggested by the Appellants that they had some minority adjustment

11

problems with respect particularly to one of the districts, and

12

the three judges on the panel below found as a fact that this was

13

a phony, that it was a pretext, that it was an attempt to use a

14

minority argument in order to justify something which had nothing

15

to do with a minority issue and to use improperly and in an

16

insulting manner the problem of minorities in order to justify

17

a statute which was the result of bad faith.

18

Looking at this picture of the redistricting suggests

19

the word gerrymander.

20

Since I was in my earliest days in school, I remember being

21

taught about gerrymander.

22

Why did the dissenting judge below, Judge Gibbons, say that as 1

23

a citizen of New Jersey, he was disturbed by looking at this

exhibit.

25

It suggests that a citizen who votes is wasting his time because

Gerrymander has become a term of obloquy.

QUESTION:

MR. HELLRING:

I would suggest looking at this map and

saying that twisting district number seven in such a way that it

has come to be known as the fishhook district is gerrymandering.

gerrymandering is a constitutional argument only in the sense that

it relates to the issue of good faith as that is given to us by

20

of testing whether a given population deviation in a given

21

statute is or is not the unavoidable result of a good faith effort

to arrive at the smallest possible population deviation.

23

would suggest, Justice White, that if this Court is ready to

deal with gerrymandering all by itself as a constitutional issue

25

and sees the necessity of doing so in this case, that it is a

Mr. Reock

suggested a plan more than six months before this one was adopted
in which there was not any such gerrymandering, and it was based
solely on the problems of population deviation without doing any

harm to compactness or state interest or anything else.

11

did not put congressmen running against each other or anything

12

else.

And, it

But, if Your Honor please, I am not suggesting that it
is necessary for this Court to find gerrymandering as a concept

15

to be an unconstitutional thing.

16

If you want to do it in this case, it is a good case to do it in,

17
18
19

20
21

but you do not need to.

That may come in a later case.

This case can be well determined and

upheld and affirmed solely on the basis that the population
deviation here was not the unavoidable result of a good faith
effort to arrive at the smallest population deviation.
And, if Your Honor, Justice White, means to suggest

22

that the smallest population deviation is not necessarily the

23

most desirable, then I think the Court would have to be ready to

24

change its ideas about one man-one vote.

25

QUESTION:

Change its ideas if Kirkpatrick and White

cut into those two cases.

MR. HELLRING: Well, may I then suggest, Your Honor, that

if there is any addition to be made by this Court in this case by

5

way of further explanation of the meaning of Article I, Section 2

6

by way of further discussion as to what Kirkpatrick may not have

7

said enough times and what Your Honor, Justice White, said in

8

White against Weiser was not said enough

9

to me that this Court should take the occasion to reemphasize

times, then it seems

10

the doctrine of one man-one vote.

11

and respect that rose up from all parts of this nation at the

12

time of Baker against Carr and Wesberry is one of the most

stunning juridical acts in this century when the idea of one man-

And, I

do hope that that great principle will not be injured by this
Court now.
Three thousand six hundred seventy-four people care
whether it is one man-one vote particularly in the fourth district
where they have 2,261 too many and in the sixth district where
they have 1,500 or so too few, totalling a difference between them
of 3,674 — that is people—and, in a State of New Jersey where
in the last gubernatorial election the present governor sits
because he had a plurality of 1,700 votes.
QUESTION:

May I ask you —

MR. HELLRING:
QUESTION:

And that is in the whole state.

May I ask you two questions about your

gerrymandering argument and the base motive that you described to
the dominant party in trying to have as many districts of the
same political flavor.

Supposing you had two plans with equal

population disparity, equally satisfied the one person-one vote
rule, and equally compact, but you could demonstrate by evidence
that the majority selected one because they thought they would
elect more of their fellow Republicans or Democrats by that plan
rather than the other, and they were frank about it.

They said

we are in control we might as well take advantage of our control.
Would you say that was unconstitutional?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

Would you say that was constitutional?

MR. HELLRING:

QUESTION:

Well, first of all —

the Legislature, not by the Court?

QUESTION:

Well, let me ask you another question.

8

Suppose the Legislature had before it two plans with very minor

9

population differences, one slightly higher than the other.

What

10

possible justifications do you agree the Constitution would per­

11

mit to be considered for the Legislature to adopt the plan with

12

the slightly higher deviation and still be acceptable?

13
14

Our Court has suggested, for example, anticipated
population shifts would justify it.

15

MR. HELLRING:

16

QUESTION:

17

That was in Kirkpatrick.

Our Court has suggested protecting incumbents

as a possible justification.

18

Is there any other justification in your view?

19

MR. HELLRING:

Well, I think there could be others.

20

None that have ever been suggested so far as I know have as yet

21

been acceptable to this Court.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. HELLRING:

24
25

Would you propose that any others should be?
Compactness in the sense of avoiding

extremes in gerrymandering, would be one.
QUESTION:

So, that it would be your view that if the

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

higher deviation were more compact on the map that that would be

2

a justification for the higher deviation?

3

MR. HELLRING:

Based on degree.

If the degree of

4

gerrymandering were very, very different, then I would say that

5

would be an acceptable reason and an important reason.

6

Gerrymandering, of course, partakes of some of these

7

other things that Your Honor referred to, such as avoiding contests

8

between two incumbent representatives and things of that sort.

9

It is part of the seamless web of all of the reasons that go into

10

11

the determinations made by a legislature.
QUESTION:

I —

Is it your view that protection of municipal

12

or district boundaries is a consideration that should permit a

13

higher deviation.

14

MR. HELLRING:

It is, but I know that this Court has

15

so far not accepted that as a valid ground.

16

upon this Court, it is not necessary to argue that in order to

17

win this case and have it affirmed by this Court.

18

answer to Your Honor's question is yes, I would consider that to

19

be a very important and valid consideration for a Court to take

20

into consideration.

21

I would urge it

But, the

Now, Appellants have enjoyed in this case at all levels

22

including this Court to talk about population deviations which

23

are within the limits of the statistical imprecisions of the

24

census which makes them equal to zero.

25

at all, and I suggest it does not, then it can only mean that any

If that has any meaning

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

population deviation which already is created by

2

in adopting a particular redistricting plan has got to be a much

3

greater population deviation if you superimpose upon it and add

4

to it the statistical imprecision of any census no matter what

5

that statistical imprecision may be.

6

the Legislature

Now, if the statistical imprecision somewhere up on

7

high in the omnipresent sky, which we do not know what it is, is

8

less than 0.7 of a percent as the population deviation here is,

9

then their argument falls for that reason.

But, if it is more,

10

let's say if it is one percent, or one and one-half or as was

11

largely studied eight or nine years after the 1970 census a

12

statistical imprecision of two and one-half to 2.6 percent —

13

2.6 percent supposedly — If it is that high then you have to

14

add about 12,000 to 15,000 people to the 3,674 people by which

15

you already have a population deviation.

16

So, that this argument about population deviation within

17

the confines of statistical imprecisions of the census is backwards

18

because if you strive for zero population deviation it may very

19

well be that because of the statistical imprecisions of any

20

census in the nature of things, there would any way be some kind

21

of a deviation.

22

If you strive for a one percent de minimus under the argument of

23

statistical imprecision, then the cases before you will then say

24

why not 1.3? Why not 1.4? Why one percent?

25

two percent, three percent, four percent, six percent?

But, why strive for anything different from zero?

Why not one percent,

34

Where do

The right answer is one man-one vote.

Three thousand

3

six hundred seventy-four is too many unless it is the result,

4

the unavoidable result, of a good faith effort — a good faith

5

effort, not this — on the part of a legislature in adopting a

6

redistricting plan.

7

In this case there has been no showing of good faith.

8

The Court below annexed to its opinion what it called a remarkable

9

document which was a letter from the Speaker of the Assembly to

10

Dr. Reock of Rutgers University in response a few days after

11

Dr. Reock sent his proposed lowest population deviation plan to

12

all the members of the Legislature, he got a letter from Speaker

13

Jackman which they recall — which they call a remarkable docu­

14

ment, and which says, you are silly if you think that we are going

15

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH J. GUIDO, JR.

18

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT — REBUTTAL

19

MR. GUIDO:

Yes, I do, Your Honor.
You have three minutes remaining.

After listening to the Appellees' argument,

20

I am a bit curious whether or not this case is about population

21

equality or whether it is about gerrymandering or some sort of

22

set of statutory standards about compactness or what.

23

There have been references to straight lines and

24

crooked lines in the arguments of the Appellees that I would

25

like to just address the Court to page 17 of the Joint Appendix
36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

to take a look at the lines that Mr. Reock's map, which was

2

stressed so heavily, has —

3

as these lines, but I think that if you look at all of the maps

4

in the Joint Appendix you will see crooked lines and not what are

5

traditionally compactness that you may find in other states

6

because of the nature of the population and its distribution.

7

Those lines may not be schematic

I would also like to address the question of partisan­

8

ship that has been maintained here.

9

the record — I think it is at the appendix on page 83, paragraph

TO

8 of Mr. Karcher's statement — which he says they were concerned

11

with the preservation of cores of preexisting districts where

12

practicable^ and - the discussions in a November, 1981 meeting

It is uncomparable within

13

included discussions of various interests of incumbent congress­

14

men both Republican and Democrat.

15

There is no finding in the District Court below that

16

there was partisan gerrymandering in this case.

17

does not support any such claim.

18

And, the record

There is no allegation in the

complaint to that effect.

In fact, the election results belie any suggestion.

incumbents but one were reelected in his district.

record shows, people were aware that the one seat that was lost

22

could be attributed to Millicent Fenwick running for the Senate

23

so that none of the incumbents would be hurt.

All

And, as the

24

Everyone knew that some members of Congress would move

25

because the district lines had to be changed because they wanted

to be closer to their core constituencies.

That is what the record shows about partisan gerry­
mandering, which is allegedly the claim of bad faith in this case.

In addition, I think that the Court should recognize

5

that this case is not a case about good faith.

good faith effort to achieve population equality.

in this case have nowhere shown that even if partisan factors

were at play here that they had any connection to the population

It is about a

And, as this Court has repeatedly stressed, most

11

recently in Rogers v. Lodge and Mobile v. Boulden is that you can

12

make some allegations about — you can make allegations about

certain things, but you sure to better show the connection between

14

that and the harm claimed.

And, the harm in this case —

in the record that tells us the degree of compactness of your

districts?

No, Your Honor.

And, the other thing is
