ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. FREEMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

6

7

We will hear arguments

MR. FREEMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
With the Court's permission, I will first have

10

a brief opening statement, then address myself to the

11

guestion of jurisdiction, and then proceed with the

12

balance of my argument.

13

On March 7th, 1979, Jonathan Lehr was deprived

14

of the most basic and precious of all human rights, the

15

right to maintain his status as a parent.

16

date Jessica, whom Mr. Lehr had always openly

17

acknowledged to be his daughter, both before and after

18

birth, was adopted by the Appellee, Richard Robertson,

19

the husband of the natural mother.

20

For on that

According to New York law, as a result of that

21

adoption Mr. Lehr's rights as a parent were forever and

22

irrevocably extinguished.

23

contacts of any nature with Jessica, no visitations, no

24

rights of inheritance.

25

There would be no more

Mr. Lehr was deprived of this child without

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

being given the opportunity of notice and the

2

opportunity to be heard, for according to the New York

3

statutory scheme then in force and effect Mr. Lehr was

4

precluded from receiving notice as those statutes were

5

construed and applied to him.

6

notice even more emphatic was the fact that at the very

7

time that Mr. Lehr's rights were being stripped in the

8

adoption proceeding in Ulster County, he had commenced a

9

paternity petition in Westchester County, unbeknown to

10

What makes this lack of

him that the adoption proceedings were pending.
In Westchester County he asserted his rights

11
12

as a parent.

He asked that the child be adjudicated and

13

that he be made the father, that he be given visitation

14

rights and that he be given the right to support

15

Jessica.

16

of this petition.

The family court judge in Ulster County knew

17

Mr. Lehr had to assert his rights in this

18

manner because he was prevented from asserting them

19

after Jessica's birth, for after Mr. Lehr’s last visit

20

at the hospital during father's visiting hours to see

21

Jessica, Lorraine, the natural mother, withheld the

22

whereabouts of Jessica for approximately six months,

23

after which Mr. Lehr had an opportunity to see Jessica

24

on a couple of weekends, and thereafter for

25

approximately 14 months before Mr. Lehr instituted these

1

paternity proceedings Lorraine Robertson withheld the

2

whereabouts of Jessica from Mr. Lehr.

3

Mr. Lehr tried desperately to find Jessica.

4

However, he was unsuccessful until right before he

5

started the paternity proceedings, at which time he

6

sought counsel and then asserted his rights as a father

7

in the paternity proceeding in Westchester County.

8

9

This Court has raised the question of
jurisdiction as to whether or not it has the right to

10

hear this appeal.

11

all three courts below that he was denied of his

12

constitutional rights of due process and equal

13

protection by virtue of the fact that the New York

14

statutory scheme as construed and applied to him denied

15

him notice and the opportunity to be heard.

16

Mr. Lehr claims and has claimed in

In particular, I'm referring to Sections

17

111(a) and 111 of the New York domestic relations law.

18

By the terms and provisions of that law, in particular

19

Section 111(a), only seven categories of unwed fathers

20

were entitled to receive notice.

21

record, Mr. Lehr was not one of these, although there is

22

a question as to whether or not he might have fit into

23

one of these categories, as to whether or not Lorraine,

24

the natural mother, had filed a written sworn statement

25

indicating that Mr. Lehr was the father.

According to the

QUESTION;

Was one of these categories those

MR. FREEMAN;

One of the categories is a

father who registers by filing a notice of intent to

claim paternity.

No, Mr. Lehr never did.

He could have.
Mr. Lehr could have,

Theoretically because, number

MR. FREEMAN;

QUESTION;

And counsel didn’t advise him he

might register?
MR. FREEMAN;

21

22

No, counsel did not advise him

to file in the putative father registry.

23

QUESTION;

24

MR. FREEMAN;

25

He had counsel at the time.

Starting in December he had counsel.

19
20

Did he have counsel?

Does the record show why not?
No, the record does not show why

not.

1

When it cams time for Mr. Lehr to assert his

2

rights, the putative father registry did not have what

3

Mr. Lehr sought.

4

notice, an irrevocable notice by one intending to claim

5

paternity.

Had he been registered, would he

not have had notice of the adoption proceeding?

Mr. Lehr -QUESTION:

The putative father registry is a mere

have been entitled to notice of the adoption

proceedings.

But we do not look to the state law as the

source of our liberty interest here.

construed the fact that in order to obtain a liberty

13

interest worthy of protection of the due process clause

of the Fourteenth Amendment, that one must be the

15

biological father and in addition that one must perform

one of the seven acts enumerated in Section 111(a).

Do you suggest by that the state

has no power to place some orderly procedures in the

area?

MR. FREEMAN:

No, the creation of a liberty

Rut the state has minimum constitutional

standards that we felt were not met by Section 111(a).

If the state establishes -QUESTION:

procedural requirements in the exercise of that right?

here that the state has gone far below.

QUESTION:

The state cannot go below those

Are you suggesting that the

constitutional right.

23

QUESTION:

What we have here is a liberty

Yes, but one of -- as I understand

it, one of his grievances is that he never got notice.

24

MR. FREEMAN:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And yet, apparently New York had a

procedure by which, had he registered, he would have had

notice of the adoption proceeding.

it?

4

MR. FREEMAN:

QUESTION:

That's true, isn't

Pardon me?

He might have had notice of the

6

adoption proceeding merely by registering in the

7

putative father registry.

8
9

MR. FREEMAN:

Yes.

We’ve indicated that

that *s true.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. FREEMAN:

■12

Is that true?

Well then, why — hew is -Because what New York State has

said is that before Mr. Lehr was entitled to due process

13

safeguards that he had to file in the putative father

14

registry or perform one of the other acts, and that he

15

had to be a biological father.

that they require before he has a liberty interest.

It's suggested that Mr. Lehr's right as a

be the biological father entitles him to due process

21

see what process was due him, and it's contended that

22

notice and the opportunity to be heard are required

23

before Mr. Lehr's liberty interest was terminated here.

25

We then look to due process procedures to

Mr. Freeman, does that mean, if you

1

justification for the liberty interest — say there are

2

no statutes at all -- does that mean there could never

3

be a valid adoption carried out where a mother places a

4

child for adoption without giving notice to the parent,

5

to the father?
MR. FREEMAN;

6

7

It’s our contention, although we

don't fit within that category —

8

QUESTION;

I know you don't.

9

MR. FREEMAN;

It's our contention that notice

10

and the opportunity to be heard must be given.

11

biological father is enough to bring in —
QUESTION;

13

A

Is always entitled to notice and an

opportunity to be heard?
MR. FREEMAN;

14

No, not necessarily entitled to

15

-- what I'm trying to indicate is that once a father is

16

a biological father, he is entitled to the protection of

17

the due process clause.
QUESTION;

18

Well, what does that mean with

19

respect to a mother with a newborn infant who wishes to

20

place the baby for adoption in the most expeditious

21

manner possible?

22

require that she give notice to the father?

Coes your view of the Constitution

23

MR. FREEMAN;

24

QUESTION;

25

Absolutely.

And the state must make sure that

they —

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. FREEMAN;

1

The state must make reasonable

2

efforts to notify the father in accordance with due

3

process.

4

occasions where identity cannot be found and notice by

5

publication is the only means of notifying somebody,

6

then the court — the court’s permitted to notify

7

somebody and cut off the constitutional rights.
QUESTION:

8

10

All right, even if th® girl doesn’t

identify who the father is and nc one knows who the
father is, what — it should be notice by publication?
MR. FREEMAN:

As this Court has indicated on a number of

There should be notice by

p ublication.

13

QUESTION:

To an unknown biological father?

14

MR. FREEMAN:

Pardon?

An unknown biological

15

father.

If the mother has not identified the father,

16

then there should be some form of notice, either notice

17

by publication, to whom it may concern —
QUESTION:

18

And that would include

19

identification of the mother,.of course, and her

20

predicament ?
MR. FREEMAN:

21

Not necessarily the

22

identification of the mother.

23

QUESTION:

How would the notice -- how would a

24

publication be meaningful unless you knew who the person

25

was?

You could identify the child.

You could possibly, if the father knew the child —

and such a date?

QUESTION;

9

Well, what does it require if you

don't know the father?

11

MR. FREEMAN;

12

It requires notice by -- some

form of notice by publication.
QUESTION;

15

any meaning at all?

16

We're saying that you

And what would the publication

Would it not have to identify the mother to have

Yes, but nobody says that it has

You're saying a meaningless notice

MR. FREEMAN;

QUESTION;

25

Pardon me?

You're saying a meaningless notice

is sufficient?
MR. FREEMAN;

In some aspects, meaningless —

no, we're giving him notice.

Court’s referring to the case of Sullane, where the

2

Court indicated there you may have to give meaningless

notice, notice that may oftentimes be futile, knowing

that you’re not going to get to the party with whom the

5

notice is directed.

6

Eut if that's the only thing that’s

Well now, the state here —

Bat that’s not —

Excuse me.

The state here in

10

effect, perhaps for the reason that published notice is

11

usually generally pretty meaningless, but in this

12

setting would be particularly so, as Justice Stevens has

13

pointed out, and to identify the mother and the child

14

would cause an embarrassment that would haunt them the

15

rest of their lives, so the state said, now, all you men

16

who want to make claims on your illegitimate children,

17

file in this registry and then you’ll have all the

18

notices.
MR. FREEMAN;

19

Once again, it's our position

20

that the state cannot do -- we’re not looking -- the

21

state has not met its due process requirements.

has he given support to his claim by his failure to

Mr. Lehr did much more than

Mr. Lehr’s identity was known to all

concerned at this particular time.

Mr. Lehr’s concern.

5

QUESTION;

The state knew of

The state didn’t know.

The state

6

had this statute for the purpose of identifying the

7

claimant, did it not, the putative father registry?
MR. FREEMAN:

8
9

For the purpose of readily

identifiable fathers.
QUESTION:

10

Well, is there something about the

11

registry that would foreclose an argument something like

12

this:

13

method of assuring that he's gotten — that he will get

14

notice, but that doesn't mean the state shouldn't give

15

notice if they know of the identity and location of the

16

putative father by some other means.

17

about the registry that prevents that argument?

Well, the state has given the putative father a

No,

QUESTION:

2

Notice —
Well, I know, but it wasn't -- I

know it wasn't meaningful notice about the adoption, but

4

they knew who he was --

HR. FREEMAN:

6

QUESTION;

7

MR. FREEMAN:

8

Oh, definitely.

-- and what his claims were.
Absolutely.

The judge knew

about that well before he signed the order of adoption.
QUESTION:

9

Is there something about the

10

registry that would say that the only way the state can

11

be given notice is through -the registry?
MR. FREEMAN:

12

No.

It's our contention that

13

the state could be given notice in any number of ways.

14

The state -QUESTION:

15

Well then, that's a much easier

16

argument for you to make than the one you're trying to

17

make.
QUESTION:

18

To follow up on that, Mr. Freeman,

19

you certainly do not have to urge this Court to require

20

that notice be given to every putative father, by

21

publication or otherwise, to win your case, do you?
MR. FREEMAN;

22

I indicated that that was not

23

our case.

I said we had done much more than that.

We

24

were a readily identifiable father who had shown concern

25

for his child.

Are they county registries?
MR. FREEMAN;

No.

This is a central registry

in the state.

QUESTION:

Where, at Albany?

11

MR. FREEMAN;

In Albany.

And at the last

12

count, since the registry was instituted in

have been 600-some odd fathers who have filed in the

putative father registry, despite the fact that there

have been maybe approximately 200,000 out of wedlock,

births during that same period of time.

QUESTION;

Well, is it — could we take

judicial notice of the fact that such fathers are

There's a number of reasons why

1

Well, as I've indicated, he has

2

the right to be heard on the best interests of his

child.

4

111(a) provides that those unwed fathers who receive

5

notice of the adoption proceeding have the right to be

6

heard on the child's best interests.

7

New York already provides for that.

Section

In addition, Mr. Lehr would have been heard as

8

to whether or not the new adoptive parents were fit to

9

have an adoption.

There have been New York cases which

10

have indicated that because of the history of the

natural mother, the emotional history of the natural

12

mother, an adoption was not permitted, irrespective of

13

the fitness of the adoptive father.

This Court has held on a number of occasions

that this basic right to- be heard is given where there

MR. FREEMAN;

The lower courts — the family

because the father here hadn’t established a sufficient

relationship with the child that Caban was

distinguishable.

of the other questions have indicated that your case is

13

The very mere fact that a person doesn't have

Very well.

MR. SAMOFF:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Throughout this argument, I respectfully
request that the Court bear three things in mind:
One is that we do not and have not conceded
that the Appellant is in fact the father of the child.
Secondly, that this is a Quilloin type

12

adoption, a stepfather adoption, a stepfather who was

13

adopting his wife's child.

14

And since there —

And the third point is that the Appellant

15

never had and never sought custody of the child, which

16

meant that regardless of what the Appellant said in any

17

court anywhere that child was going to continue to live

18

in the mother's household and was going to continue to

19

be the de facto child of the stepfather.

that’s where his rights spring from.
And this is what the Court of Appeals seized

on.

The Court of Appeals said, we are not going to hold

his constitutional arguments.

7

may imply that they upheld the constitutionality of the

New York statute, I suppose it may be implied, but for

the fact that the Court of Appeals itself specifically

10

stated in no uncertain terms that it wasn’t addressing

11

that issue.

Now, whether or not one

Accordingly, I suggest that this Court should

13

not and does not have jurisdiction over this case,

14

because the Court of Appeals, rightly or wrongly, said

they said.

dR. SAMOFF:

I think that under 1257,

22

subdivision (2), there are a couple of elements;

one,

23

the highest court of the state -- the constitutional

Not at all, Your Honor.

Now, I think a major point that was raised in

different kind of adoption.

There is no law, there is no

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

Appellant in this case argued in that case, that the

2

Westchester County family court should permit the

3

paternity proceeding to go ahead despite the fact that

4

there had been an adoption, because it would give him

5

visitation -- it might give him visitation rights, and

6

that the court had the authority to permit visitation.
In the argument in that case — it was all

submitted.

QUESTION;

9
10

There was no oral argument.
Does a mother always have the power

to veto an adoption in New York?

11

MR. SAMOFF;

12

QUESTION;

Yes.

Yes, and it's —

So if the child is living with the

13

father and always has, and the mother has departed and

14

remarries, and the father remarries and the new mother

15

wants to adopt the child, the mother can nevertheless

16

veto it?
MR. SAMOFF;

17

That is an inequity that this

that this is in fact the same case.
There's another argument also, and that is

that the rights given under Caban, if they did exist,

are substantive rights.

lead to procedural due process rights, which gets us

Is it not clear that if that happens then Caban

MR. SAMOFF;

10

gave before, that he is in fact the father, can

12

establish it, and that he did not otherwise abandon the

child —

14

MR. SAMOFF;

— that's right, this adoption is

dead, finished.

So that actually, although we're

addressing a procedural point, we may actually also

19

decide the merits inevitably?

20

MR. SAMOFF;

Oh, yes.

Ch, yes.

That is a

21

very major -- it is a very major point of our argument,

22

is that we now have a -- we have a child who has always

23

lived in one family, we have a person who is a claimant

24

who has never sought custody, never had custody, never

25

supported the child, never done anything with respect to

If this case is reversed, then there's a very

13

If there wasn't an adoption, but

14

just custody by the mother, unless the father was

15

somehow disqualified he could have visitation rights and

16

could maintain some kind of a relationship with his

17

child.

21

MR. SAMOFFi

That’s true in every adoption

case there is.
QUESTION*

Well, in this case, as I understand

it, all he wants is visitation, isn't that right?

22

MR. SAMOFFi

23

QUESTION*

Well, that is all --

And if this decree is reversed,

25

Yes.

even though there may not be an adoption, I gather the

is that right?

He would still have to establish his

I appreciate that.

But all — the

8

bottom line for him if he wins on his present

9

application is only visitation rights, isn't it?

10
11

MR. SAMOFF;

That was the status at the time

he filed his paternity petition.

12

QUESTION:

Well, what is it now?

13

MR. SAMOFF:

He could change his tune now.

14

Oh, he could change his tune.

15

if he wants.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. SAM0FF:

With a new petition?
Sure, with a new petition.

18

other petition was dismissed.

19

QUESTION:

20
21

He could now seek custody

That

But he wouldn't win unless he shows

the mother is unfit to have custody.
MR. SAHQFF:

But we contend that that is

22

precisely the kind of thing that he could have shown in

23

his 114 petition and failed to do.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Samoff, are you saying or

conceding that as a matter of federal constitutional law

52

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that if the natural father does not abandon the child

2

and doesn't consent to an adoption he can veto any

3

adoption until the child reaches majority?

4

Court has held that; I just hadn't realized it.
MR. SAMOFF;

5

No,

Perhaps this

I didn't contend that.

I

6

contend under the statute, under New York statutory

7

scheme, that could happen.
QUESTION;

8
9

Well, all you have to do is to

change the law about the necessity for the mother's

10

consent, put them on an egual basis, and Caban is out

11

the window.
MS. SAMOFF;

12

Well, fortunately or

13

unfortunately, New York has changed its law in response

14

to Caban and has not dispensed with the consent.

15

adds a new category of persons whose consent is

16

required.

QUESTION;

MS. SAMOFF;

Which is the father.

a substantive right that one must establish throuah

24

to him and failed to take advantage of it.

25

argue that what he did was ev en more.

He would

53

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

what he did was something other than what the statute

2

required, but not more, because if he had timely filed

3

on the putative father registry we would have known of

4

his existence in advance.
This putative father registry was checked

5
6

three times.

I checked it before filing the petition,

7

the court checked it at the time of filing the petition,

8

and right up to the day we walked into the court for a

9

hearing on January

15th the court again checked it and

10

got a certificate that there was nobody on the list.

11

this point he still hadn't even started his paternity

12

petition.
QUESTION:

13

At

Hr. Samoff, I thought under the

14

amended New York law that the consent of the father

15

would only be required if the father had maintained a

16

substantial and continuous or repeated contact with the

17

child.

18
19
20

HR. SAHOFF:

Yes.

There are two other

provisions, also, that follow that.
QUESTION:

Or the payment of support, or other

21

things that I would think under the facts of this case

22

would be very unlikely to be established.

23

MR. SAMOFF:

If this Court is going to reverse

24

and send it back, one, we hold this child in limbo

25

through several more legal proceedings; and, based upon

what Your Honor has just stated, upon the face of it he

2

is disqualified, then what are we doing here?
QUESTION:

3

On the face of it, would you not

4

agree that under the amended statute even if it were to

5

go back it is certainly not a foregone conclusion that

6

the father would have a so-called veto power or would

7

have to consent to the adoption?
MR. SAMOFF:

8
9
10

Certainly, certainly.

Starting

with the premise that we don't even concede he's the
father, there's the possibility —
QUESTIONi

11

All right, but assuming he

12

establishes that, it's not quite the picture you were

13

painting, is it?
MR. SAMOFF;

14

No, because I do believe that in

15

any and all events he would not be entitled to notice --

16

I mean, not be entitled to notice and withhold his

17

consent, I should say, even under the new statute.

18

I see my time is up.

MR. FREEMAN;

8

There should be a starting of de

9

novo, or possibly, there is the other possibility, where

10

a hearing would be held as if the adoption had not taken

11

place, giving the Appellant all the rights that he would

12

have had had he been given notice originally.
All we're asking for is to be heard on

13
14

whatever substantive rights we may have.

15

what substantive rights we're going to have.

16

going to depend on our contacts with the child.

17

18

taken into consideration is whether or not the father

19

was prevented from seeing the child by the mother.

20

in addition, the New York statute provides that the

21

amount of support which he is required to give is

MR. FREEMAN:

QUESTION:

ME. FREEMAN:

Yes, we object to the adoption

You do object.

That’s all I

asked .
HE. FREEMAN:

Okay.

With respect to the

10

intervention motion, what the Appellees are contending

11

is that in order to get due process one must file a

12

notice to intervene, and that of course does not follow

13

from what our Constitution says.
