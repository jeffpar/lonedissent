The specific question presented on certiorari

here is whether the applicable statute, 35 USC 284,

requires the award of prejudgment interest on

4

unliquidated damages based on reasonable royalties,

5

where there is a finding that the defendant acted in

6

good faith and not recklessly.
QUESTION:

8

Is the question whether it requires

it or whether it permits it, or are they the same thing?
NR. FROST:

9

No.

If the Court please, the

10

first question here is whether it requires it.

We think

11

the court of appeals held that interest was mandatory.

12

Then we go on to the question of whether the Duplate

13

versus Triplex case is still the law, and finally, to

14

the influence of the Georgia Pacific case, which I will

The statute provides that in patent cases, the

MR. FROST;

Act, and the way the Act is sat up, it is very clear

9

that that is expressly stated to be discretionary,

10

unlike the case of interests and costs which in each

11

instance there was a settled rule, and the construction

12

of the Act indicates that it was the intent of Congress

13

that that rule be followed.
Now, coming to the 1552 Patent Code, it did

14
15

codify the patent law, and Section 254 of the Code

16

replaced the law on recoveries previously covered by the

17

1946 Act.

18

The revisor notes on the Code point out that the Code

19

only made some changes in language at that point, and

20

plaintiffs here concede that Section 284 was not

21

intended to change the applicable provisions of the 1946

22

Act.

23

The language closely follows the 1946 Act.

The error of the court below commenced with

24

its misapplication of the dictum of the ruling of this

25

Court in Aro versus Convertible Top, 377 US.

In that

1

case, four Justices of this Court examined the basis for

2

recoveries for patent infringement under 35 DSC 284.

3

The issue of concern was whether the profits of the

4

infringer or damages to the patentee are the measure of

5

recovery.

6

In explaining the effect of the 1946 Act, they

7

quoted the House report on the bill that became the 1946

8

Act.

9

included the later rejected interest language.

At the time the House report was made, the bill

portion of the report quoted in the opinion included

on prejudgment interest.

15

The inclusion

There is no issue in the case

The courts of appeal for the Sixth, Second,

16

and Seventh Circuits have specifically held that the

17

quotation in the Aro case is not controlling, and that

18

the statute does not compel prejudgment interest.

19

court below stands alone in holding that the Aro

20

quotation controls and in relying upon it to compel

21

interest in a reasonable royalty case, notwithstanding

22

the history of the statute.

23

The

To be sure, the Court added to its reference

24

to Aro by seeking to justify the award of prejudgment

interest because the defendant had the use of the

4

always a span of time between the late of an

5

infringement and the date of a judgment awarding

6

d am ages.

But this is true in every case.

There is

If interest is allowable in this case, for

7
8

this reason, it is allowable in every case.

In short,

9

this reason only adds to the basic error of misapplying

10

the dictum in the Aro case instead of looking to the Act

11

as passed.

12

The judgment should be reversed, because the

13

decision below is based on a manda to ry interest

14

requirement that Congress rejected and is clearly

15

contrary to the statute.

16

Now, the history of the 1946 Act also answers

17

other guestions in this case.

Devex contends that the

18

term "compensation" as used in 35 USC 284 requires

19

prejudgment interest.

20

by the House and reached the Senate provided for due

21

compensation, not less than a reasonably royalty, using

22

that very term, and the statute or post statute at that

23

time also used explicitly required interest from the

24

time infringement occurred.

than a reasonable royalty remained in the statute, and

2

the words "interest as may be fixed by the court" were

3

substituted for "interest from the time the infringement

4

occurred."
Now,

5

whether we take the time before the

6

amendment or after,

7

obviously was not used in a sense of requiring

8

interest.

interest from the time the infringement occurred before

The Senate report in its first

paragraphs states very specifically the changes in the

quotation of the House report in its totality, which is

Why?

In the first place, General

Motors* conduct was in good faith, not reckless.

Then

9

it seems to me that we should turn to the question of

10

the conduct of Devex here, and particularly the conduct

11

of Devex insofar as it relates to the delays that took

12

place in this case.

13

case here that was a protracted ca se.

14

me that the key point here is, how did the conduct of

15

Devex pertain to that factor?

16

think it very clearly was contrary to allow ing

17

prejudgment interest.

Obviously,

we are dealing with a

question.

The case was filed in the Northern District

20

of Illinois, and there was an early hearing on venue.

21

Devex was fully aware of the facts, and it then

22

sidestepped venue, went through a trial on validity, and

23

then almost ten years later moved to shift the case to

24

Delaware, which motion was successful, was done, but

25

certainly delayed the case.

The second thing that occurred here was the

1

2

patent claim itself.

The patent claim was broad and

3

sweeping and invalid as literally construed.

4

exactly what Judge Bobson held in around I960, and the

5

court of appeals agreed with that finally, but it did

6

give the claim a narrow and restricted construction.

7

rewrote the claim.

8

claim was to make it impossible to know exactly what the

9

claim did cover, with one exception.

This is

The effect of that rewriting of the

15

That is the literal language that was in their

Now, the delays that occurred in this case had

in great measure dealt with the — resolving the

17

20

21

validated the patent because of special chemical

22

coaction between the Borax and the other ingredients, so

23

that when the court of appeals decision was made,

1

Your Honor. * That is really not in issue.

2

3o that plaintiff’s submission is that

3

"together with interest" at least means that the

4

prejudgment interest as such is mandatory.

5

considering the fact that the statute as passed is

6

silent as to the time frame and as to when the interest

7

should begin to run, then under those circumstances the

8

intended scope of the interest provision is revealed

9

explicitly in the legislative history.

10

Now,

The Senate committee expressly adopted the

11

House committee report, which stated, "a reasonable

12

royalty together with interest from the time

13

infringement occurred."

14

committee’s rationale was also stated, namely, in

15

referring to proceedings before masters that are often

16

protracted for decades, and in many cases result in a

17

complete failure of justice.

In addition, the House

attorneys’ fees, they would have worded it this way.

25

"The court may in its discretion award interest, costs,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

2

QUESTIONi

Or it could have said, "Interest as

3

fixed by the court, and cost as fixed by the court," but

4

instead it just said "interest and costs as fixed by the

5

court."

6

MR. BENDERi

But, Your Honor,

I believe that

7

does take it out of context, because the preamble to

8

that is, "The court shall award a reasonable royalty."

9

"The court shall award a reasonable royalty together

10

with interest," and under those circumstances, I believe

11

that the "together with interest" and "a reasonable

12

royalty" mean that the court must fix a reasonable

13

royalty together with interest, and "as fixed by the

14

court" does not mean that the interest itself is fully

15

discretionary.

16

And I think the legislative history

17

demonstrates that, if Your Honor please, because Senator

18

Pepper in reporting the House bill to the Senate, he

19

said, it is a House bill, and he says, it has the

20

unanimous support of the Senate Committee on Patents.

21

In fact, the bill as adopted by the Senate, contrary to

22

what Mr. Frost said, was very specific about that.

23

It says,

"The House Committee on Patents held

despite the fact that there is no reference in the

They adopted that view because the

MR. BENDER:

There was an industry defense

21

against this patent, Your Honor.

The chemical

22

companies, the suppliers had all joined together with

23

General Motors in making certain that they were going to

24

defend this case to the hilt, and nobody took a license

25

from the plaintiffs, and that in effect, that open

infringement by the entire industry even beat down that

2

offer that we made of three-quarters of 1 percent.

3

It is this simple history of this litigation

4

which demonstrates why this guilty tort feasor did not

5

take a license, because it was hoping that ultimately it

6

was going to, even if it had to pay a reasonable royalty

7

ultimately, it was going to garner in the interest that

8

it had retained from that reasonable royalty for,

9

indeed, over a 25-year period, GM would have made $11

10

million of interest on the reasonable royalty if it were

11

permitted to keep that interest.

12

Under those circumstances, the courts below

13

found that it would be against ^public policy not to

14

award the interest, because it would defeat the amicable

15

licensing of patents and it would tend to prolong the

16

litigation.

17

this litigation has been prolonged because of GK's hope

18

that it will not have to pay the prejudgment interest.

19

In addition, there is a vary -- another very

Indeed, we have had that right here, that

20

important factor here that supports the judgment below,

21

and that is inflation.

the so-called TKPP lubricants, which did not use Borax

royalties and established royalties, and the decisions

2

cannot recover any greater sum than 4the established

3

royalties, but in that case the damages are in effect

4

liquidated, and therefore prejudged interest should be

allowed.

6

That is what happened in the Marvel case, and

7

the reference to the change in the statute in that case

8

and the A ro quotation was on an entirely different

factual setting for just that reason.
Reference has been made to the US Code, and as

I recall it was the

1946 edition.

In any event, that is

12

not an official compilation of the law at all.

13

look, at the front part, it very clearly states it was

14

prepared by West Publishing Company and several other

15

contractors, and the committee very carefully states

16

that it is only prima facie law.

If you

Mow, lastly, I do want to point out that there

18

has been no reason at all for the Senate to have changed

19

the text of the bill that became the 1946 Act if it was

20

satisfied with mandatory interest.

21

possible explanation than what the Senate did was to

22

recognize that requirement of interest from the time of

infringement as being not what it wanted.
