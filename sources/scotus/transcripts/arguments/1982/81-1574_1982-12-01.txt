ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

9

MR. GOLD*

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

10

may it please the Court, the procedural history of this

11

case is set out at Pages 2 through 6 of our brief, the

12

blue brief, and I will very briefly summarize that

13

history.

14

This matter began when Mr. Jones filed a

15

charge with the Atlanta Regional Office of the National

16

Labor Relations Board against Local 926 of the Operating

17

Engineers.

18

Pages 2 and 3 of our brief.

19

union violated Sections 8(b)(1)(A) and 8(b)(1)(B) of the

20

National Labor Relations Act as amended, the sections

21

prohibiting certain forms of restraint and coercion.

22

The language of the charge is set out at
The allegation is that the

The regional director investigated that charge

23

and issued a letter opinion stating that he would not

24

file a complaint —

25

QUESTION*

Mr. Gold, is it possible to tell

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

from that letter whether or not he took his action on

2

the basis of no evidence, or that it was the type of

3

thing that the board didn’t go into?

4

KR . GOLD:

It appears to us from the language

5

he used that he found the evidence insufficient to find

6

that the union had caused the discharge, that he found

7

the evidence insufficient to find that the union had

8

restrained or coerced the employer, that he found that

9

the union had participated in discussions with the

10

employer concerning who should be a supervisor on this

11

job, and all of these questions are of the very essence

12

of Section 8(b)(1), and what is designedly left

13

unregulated and is permitted by Section 8(b)(1) so that

14

it would be our view that he was not taking the

15

position, this is none of our business, but rather, was

16

taking the position that this was not the type of

17

activity which warranted the issuance of a complaint.

QUESTION:

Was review available to Jones, of

course?
The next point I

21

was going to make is that the board, as this Court has

22

recognized, has adopted a very rigorous internal system

23

of determining when to exercise prosecutorial discretion

24

on behalf of charging parties, and that includes not

25

only an investigation and determination at the regional

Does he have any other relief than

MR. GOLD;

The — I think the short answer

that?

under the decisions is no.

The courts of appeals are

10

uniform that there is no jurisdiction in the courts to

11

review the general counsel's exercise of his authority

12

to institute complaints any more than there is to review

13

a United States Attorney's determination not to

14

prosecute an alleged crime.

15

Rather than going to the NLRB general counsel,

16

the -- fir. Jones went to the state courts of Georgia.

17

He filed a lawsuit alleging that the union had violated

18

the Georgia law prohibiting tortious interference with

19

employment relations.

20

alleging that he had been a union member and had dropped

21

his union membership, and goes on to allege this

22

interference with employment relationships, is set out

23

at Pages 4 and 5 of our brief.

The complaint which begins by

He also sued the employer, and in addition he
alleged a violation of the Georgia right to work law.

1

All parties moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground

2

that this is the type of matter within the exclusive

3

jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board under

4

the Garmon Rule articulated by this Court.

5

court agreed.

6

view, as those courts have taken in the past, that the

7

tort of interference with employment relations is not

8

pre-empted either for supervisors or for employees in

9

that state.

The trial

The Georgia appellate court took, the

The union invoked both this Court's appellate

10
11

jurisdiction and the certiorari jurisdiction, and the

12

court in setting the case for plenary consideration

13

reserved the question of jurisdiction.
I unfortunately from my own standpoint have to

14
15

be very brief indeed on the question of appellate

16

jurisdiction.

17

there is no appellate jurisdiction.

18

matter after the court's order, and that is our view,

19

and we felt it our obligation to state it

20

straightforwardly.

We have confessed in our papers that
We reviewed this

We do believe that this case is properly here

21

22

on certiorari.

It is our substantive position that the

23

Georgia court's rule is squarely contrary to the rule

24

stated by this Court in the Borden and Perko cases in

25

373 U.S.

The argument made by respondents is that we

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

haven't shown a sufficient conflict between Georgia law

2

and this Court's law to warrant certiorari.

3

understand how wa could show a clearer conflict.

We do not

Perko, like this case, is a case in which a

4
5

supervisor allege! that a union interfered with his

6

employee — employment relationship.

7

difference between that case and this case is that Mr.

8

Perko didn't even start down the road of exhausting

9

Labor Board procedures, but rather went directly to

The only

10

court.

Tort claimed in that case and the tort claimed

11

in this case are the same.

12

cases is the same, and this Court, as we fully developed

13

in our brief in Perko, held that the tort of

14

interference with employment relations in situations of

15

this kind is pre-emptive.
QUESTION:

The union's conduct in both

Mr. Gold, as between you and Ms.

17

Stillman, have you divided up the responsibility for

18

talking about the particular sections of the Act and

19

whether conduct was pre-empted?
MR. GOLD:

20

Yes.

I have four or five more

21

minutes.

22

the Act as a whole this tort is pre-empted.

1

MR. GOLDs

Any time. Your Honor.

2

QUESTIONS

Okay.

3

MR. GOLDs

Ms. Stillman was going to develop

4

what the exact nature of the Labor Board's regulation,

5

scheme of regulation is in this area, because one prong

6

of our argument is that this is an area where there is a

7

substantial body of Labor Board regulation, and

8

therefore even if one assumes that we look only at the

9

arguably prohibited aspect of Garman, this is, as Perko

10

holds, an area where the particular system of

11

procedures, rules, and remedies stated in the Labor Act

12

pre-empts state law.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Well, I will ask you, and you tell

me if I should ask Mrs. Stillman rather than you.
Why does this conduct violate the 8(b)(1)(A),

16

making it unfair labor practice for a union to coerce

17

employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in

18

Section 7, when the individual was a supervisor?

19

MR. GOLD:

Well, the 8(b)(1) has two parts.

20

The Labor Board takes the view that where, and this is

21

particularly true in the construction industry, you have

22

people who move back and forth between supervisory and

23

employee status, union restraint or coercion of an

24

employer based on the union or non-union status of a

25

supervisor violates the employee's rights, because for

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the same kind of demonstration effect this Court relied

2

on in cases like American Broadcasting Company versus

3

Writers* Guild.
QUESTION;

4

Are there two different lines for

5

that Board rule, one being if it can happen to him, it

6

can happen to me, that type of thing?

7

just retreated from that aspect in the Parker Robb

8

decision?

9

.HR. GOLD:

Hasn’t the Board

Not from that aspect so far as we

10

can tell, because they cited and reaffirmed Taladiga

11

Cotton, which this Court relied on in Perko, and which

12

is part and parcel --

13

QUESTION;

But the reason they withdrew at

14

least a little in Parker Robb, isn’t it the feeling that

15

they were really putting an end run around the exemption

16

of supervisors in the Act if they went further?

17

HR. GOLD;

We can hardly say that we want the

18

Board to push further and further into this area, but

19

the discussion we are having certainly demonstrates that

20

this is arguably prohibited.

21

QUESTION;

Yes, certainly arguably, but do you

22

think that your best case is on arguably, that if we

23

were to take it on ourselves to decide, is this in fact

24

prohibited, and we came to the conclusion, no, it is not

25

in fact prohibited, that you would then have to rely on

g
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

the arguably prohibited aspect?

MR. GOLD;

Well, our view is, and this is the

3

one point I do want to stress before I allow Ms.

4

Stillman her time, that in the area of the extent to

5

which unions can have an impact on supervisors'

6

employment rights, the logic of the entire Act is, as

7

shown by the use of the words "restraint” and "coercion"

8

and by the whole theme of the 1947 debates on the status

9

of supervisors, is that employers should have very

10

substantial protections in being able to make whatever

11

judgments they want on how they treat supervisors.

12

As I am sure you are well aware, under the

13

Beasley case, the employer cannot be held under a state

14

right to work law for firing somebody for joining a

15

union or refusing to join a union if that person is a

16

supervisor,

17

that employers have.

18

as just one example of the great freedom

Given the logic of that situation, we believe

19

that a union certainly can in the interests of its own

20

members ask an employer not to have a certain person as

21

a supervisor and not to have him do certain supervisory

22

tasks, and if that is true, certainly to the extent a

23

union is not engaging in restraint and coercion and is

24

limiting itself to such activity, the area is either

25

arguably protected or designedly left unreglated.

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

And thus, even if it were to be plainly and

2

unequivocally established and taken as established that

3

the union did not violate 8(b)(1), it would not preclude

4

the conclusion that a Georgia determination that the

5

union committed this tort works the greatest possible

6

interference with the federal scheme, namely, a state

7

interdiction of that which Congress allowed to happen,

8

and which in its very extensive — which in Congress's

9

very extensive consideration of how to regulate

10

union-management relations with regard to supervisors,

11

it did not make an unfair labor practice.

12

QUESTION*

Well, as you see it, then, there

13

are three bright squares in this area.

14

actually prohibited.

15

prohibited, and the other is the designedly left free.

16

MR. GOLD:

One is the

The other is the arguably

Yes, and whenever a state tort

17

action focuses on precisely the same facts and

18

circumstances that the board would consider in

19

determining which of those boxes to put alleged conduct,

20

then the state action is pre-empted.

21

QUESTION*

Well, of course, does that fully

22

explain our Sears decision?

23

taken into consideration the same facts had they been

24

brought to its attention by another party.

25

MR. GOLD*

There the board would have

In Sears, there was an added factor

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

which is not here, namely, the consideration that there

2

was no way to secure the — a board determination or a

3

general counsel's determination.

4

labor practice which the individual could invoke.

5

the critical inquiry, has the union restrained,

6

restrained or coerced, or has it not, is as open to this

7

supervisor as it is to any employee and any 8(a)(1) or

8

8(a)(3) or 8(b)(1) or 8(b)(2).

9

has never been a case that I know of, and there would be

There was no unfair

The door is open.

Here,

There

10

nothing left of the doctrine, I would suggest, if in

11

that situation where the door to the general counsel is

12

open, it was nonetheless held that the state courts were

13

also an alternative forum.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELINOR HADLEY STILLMAN, ESQ.,

16

ON BEHALF OF THE NLEB AS AMICUS CURIAE

17

MS. STILLMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

18

please the Court, it is the board’s position that the

19

trial court judge in this case did exactly the right

20

thing in finding that the complaint, the state action

21

was pre-empted in dismissing the complaint, because, as

22

he said, I am being asked to take a second look at the

23

same matter that the board has looked at here, and in

24

fact has resolved in manners displeasing to the

25

plaintiff .

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

We have explained in our brief — We addressed

2

our brief mainly to the complaint allegation, which was,

3

there is malicious interference with contract here

4

because the union coerced and intimidated the company

5

into firing him.

6

that seemed to be the theory in the motion to dismiss or

7

affirm.

That is what the complaint said, and

They are now saying, well, we don't have to

8

9

show coercion and intimidation of the employer.

10

win in the Georgia court if we just show simple

11

interference, just knowingly procured breach of

12

contract, and that they say is not a matter for the

13

board or not a matter with which the board is

14

concerned.

15

QUESTION:

16

the employer, didn’t they --

Well, the superior court dismissed

MS. STILLMAN:

QUESTION:

20

We can

Yes.

-- saying that under any theory,

you couldn't hold the employer liable.
MS. STILLMAN:

He is totally free to do what

21

— and that raises the interesting question, Justice

22

Rehnquist, of what happens if an employer wanting to

23

make a decision about a supervisor calls in the union

24

and asks for the union's advice.

25

inducing the union to induce a breach of contract then

Is the employer

1

if he decides to follow the suggestions of the union

2

agent?
QUESTION*

3

Well, I suppose other than whatever

4

prohibitions may be placed on it by conficting federal

5

law, Georgia is free to fashion its tort law —

6

NS. STILLNANs

7

QUESTION:

8

NS. STILLNANs

9

Yes, yes, yes.

— and malicious interference —
But it does seem to us that

elements critical to the Georgia tort are also resolved

10

by the board in considering 8(b)(1)(A) and 8(b)(1)(B)

11

and in fact were resolved by the regional director in

12

this case, and I would like here — first let me say our

13

brief addresses mainly 8(b)(1)(B), because it is quite

14

clear that when the regional director said, this union

15

did not coerce the company, that they should not be able

16

to go over to the state court then and say that they

17

coerced the company.
But the regional director also said, as Hr.

18
19

Gold pointed out, the union did not cause the

20

discharge.

21

QUESTION;

Are you saying that — so supposing

22

that the regional director were to make a finding, a

23

mistaken finding as it turned out, in an area which

24

wasn't even — which wasn't designedly left free, wasn't

25

in fact prohibited, and wasn't arguably prohibited, but

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

he was just sticking his nose into things that the board

2

really wouldn't have authorized him to go ahead with,

3

and he made a finding on some facts that were never

4

appealed.

5

MS. STILLMANs

Well, that is not present here,

6

because the finding that he did make is relevant to this

7

case .

8

QUESTIONS

Yes.

9

MS. STILLMANs

I suppose if he was on a

10

complete frolic and detour —

11

QUESTION:

12

So it isn't a type of res judicata

or collateral estoppel charge, is it?
MS. STILLMAN:

13

Well, that's — but that’s

14

embodied to some extent in, I think, the policy reasons

15

here.

16

more on what you were exploring with Mr. Gold concerning

17

the board's theory of violations of 8(b)(1)(A) in the

18

construction of this -- because that is very relevant to

19

this case, and we didn't emphasize this much in our

20

brief because we thought their theory was intimidation

21

and coercion of the employer.

I would like. Justice Rehnqist, to touch a little

The board has held — now, I am not talking at

22

23

first with respect to a supervisory position.

I am

24

talking now with respect to, let's say, an employee

25

job.

The board has held that when a union has a hiring

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

hall, when the union has control over jobs out there,

2

an! employees have to come through the hiring hall to

3

get jobs, it is, of course, perfectly proper for the

4

union, if it is running its hiring hall properly,

5

non-arbitrarily, to have that kind of control, but if a

6

business agent takes action with respect to somebody's

7

job opportunity on some arbitrary basis — let's say

8

he's very hostile to the man, he says, you have been

9

speaking out in union meetings in a way that I don't

10

like, and you're not going to — I'm going to put you

11

down at the bottom of the list, and you're not going to

12

be treated as fairly as other people — well, the board

13

says this is an 8(b)(1)(A), because this is intimidating

14

that man in his right to be not a docile union member if

15

he doesn't want to.

16

have to toe the line, not to have to curry the favor of

17

the business agent.

He has a Section 7 right not to

And so that is an 8(b)(1)(A).

18

Now, what happens — Now, of course,

19

supervisors ordinarily wouldn't have that right, because

20

they don't enjoy rights under Section 7.

21

excluded from the definition of employee.

22

happens in the construction industry is, you have

23

workers coming through these hiring halls, and they may

24

on one job get a referral out to a foreman's job, on the

25

next — that job finishes.

They are
But what

Typically these jobs don't

11

that, although I don't think that is a reviewable record

12

here, said that in the past he had taken employee jobs,

13

and there is no — certainly no — it can't be argued

14

that he wouldn't be dependent on the union in the future

15

for employee jobs.

16

In fact, the deposition, if you want to get into

What the board says about people in the

17

construction industry is, these men are dependent on the

18

union hiring hall to get jobs, and when the union agent

19

interferes -- interferes even by just asking the

20

employer, not necessarily coercing the employer,

21

demonstrates to the workman, I can interfere with your

22

job, he intimidates that workman in his status of, and

23

to the jurisdictional issue.

The real question is, is

It held that this case fit within one of the

18

exceptions to the pre-emption doctrine.

In fact, in the

19

exceptions laid down in the Garmon case itself, it held

20

that because he was a supervisor, the plaintiff was a

21

supervisor, it was only of peripheral concern to the

22

Act, and that the issue was deeply seated in local

23

feelings -- there is a citizen of Georgia who has been

24

deprived of his right to work — and that there was

25

little likelihood of interference with the federal labor

laws because the federal agency had already had a look,

2

at it, and it went on to hold that there were different

3

causes of action in the state and federal forums.
It did not create a new exception to the

4
5

pre-emption document.

It found a limited fact situation

6

where a supervisor who has pursued his derivative

federal remedy and was unsuccessful could then file a

8

state court lawsuit.

a lot of state court actions, and the bottom line is

that the Georgia court of appeals properly applied the

Well, all right.

You go ahead.

14

MR. GORE;

Well, it is the plaintiff’s

15

position that the fundamental issue in this case is not

16

whether pre-emption took place, but whether an unfair

17

labor practice proceeding is a supervisor’s exclusive

18

forum to seek relief from union interference.

19

plaintiff's position that if the NLRB finds that the

20

union's actions did not violate the rights of persons

21

protected by the federal law, employees or employers,

22

then the supervisor is free to pursue his private cause

23

of action in state court.

24
25

This is true for two reasons.

It is the

2

to violate supervisors' rights to employment contracts.

3

And secondly, the causes of action in the state and

4

federal forums would be different.
Now, when the Act was amended in 1947,

Congress aided Section 14(a) in direct response to an

record, ani we have the collective bargaining agreement

16

in the record down at the trial court, that the employer

17

has the absolute right to hire who it wants, and that

18

the supervisors are not to go through the hiring hall.

19

So, as to this supervisor, the plaintiff, I don’t

20

believe it is a construction industry case.
True, the people who may work under him are

In the record, it shows that they

going to be going in and out of the hiring hall.
In summary, we believe the decision of the

Georgia court of appeals does not merit review by this

Court.

They correctly applied this Court’s prior

holdings, and they correctly decided the case.

However,

2

should the Court decide to review the case on the

merits, I would like to draw attention to one sentence

in the Lockridge dissent.
"Where persons with otherwise justiciable

5

6

claims cannot obtain a hearing under the law, the law is

7

subject to close scrutiny to discover the circumstances

8

compelling such a result."
Now, when the Court closely scrutinizes this

9
10

law, it will find that Congress did not intend to strip

11

supervisors of their common law rights to seek redress

12

from — for intentional torts, and that after a

13

supervisor is unsuccessful in obtaining relief under a

14

derivative federal cause of action, he can pursue his

own private cause of action in the state courts.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER»

Hr. Gold.

3

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD, ESQ.,

4

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS - REBUTTAL

5

MR. GOLD*

Mr. Chief Justice, it is our view

6

that the respondent's argument simply ignores the fact

7

that Congress in 1947 did not only give employers wide

8

areas of freedom with regard to the hire and fire of

9

supervisors, but that Congress also in Section 8(b)(1)

10

regulated union conduct to a substantial extent with

11

regard to what unions can and cannot do in interfering

12

with such employment relations.

13

QUESTION»

What if an employee -- what if a

14

supervisor has an agreement like the respondent here

15

apparently was contemplating with the employer for a

16

term of years' employment and that sort of thing, and

17

the employer breaches it.

18

the state court and sue the employer without being

19

defended against on the ground that Congress intended to

20

have employers -- give freedom of action to employers

21

against supervisors?

My understanding from this Court's

23

decision in Beasley is that the answer is that he cannot

That is preposterous.

1

MR. GOLD:

2

QUESTION;

the employer
Don’t you think it’s preposterous,

3

putting Beasley to one side?

4

MR. GOLD:

We certainly didn’t lobby to take

5

supervisors out fcom under the Act.

Congress’s view was

6

that employers should have faithful agents and shouldn’t

7

be bound by any restrictions.

8

right to work laws, even though 14(b) normally gives

9

them precedence, don’t take precedent.

That is why the state

Obviously, that

10

was the view of the Georgia courts here, because the

11

empty seat is the seat of the employer, and our basic

12

view is that when Congress came to regulating unions, it

13

said, unions may not restrain and coerce employers in

14

that freedom, but it used those limited words, and it

15

did it against the background of an overall system of

16

labor relations where unions can discuss employee

17

concerns with employers, and that it cannot be.

18

It would be in terms of absurdities or

19

paradoxes far greater if the union by exercising that

20

which Congress designedly left unregulated, namely, its

21

right to go in and say to the employer, it is not good

22

labor relations to have this man supervising these

23

employees, opens itself to a state tort action with

24

damages and punitive damages, whereas if it restrains

25

and coerces the employer, you go through the labor board

proceeding
As the Court said in Garmon, Congress

2

3

regulated areas of activity or conduct.

4

areas of activity or conduct was this interplay

5

concerning -- between employers and unions that

6

represent those employers, employees, the job tenure of

7

supervisors.

case is indistinguishable from Perko.

Congress nor this Court has changed the rules.

Perko was right when it was iecided.

Mr. Gold, was it necessary for the

general counsel to find that the union did not cause the

Only in one narrow sense.

MR. GOLD;

as in this case, he does go to the labor board, the fact

25

that the labor board determines not to go forward

Is it an unfair labor practice for

it is an unfair labor practice if the union is acting

I suppose the board takes the

position that a breach of the duty to represent fairly

is an unfair labor practice.

13

MR. GOLDs

That is right.
