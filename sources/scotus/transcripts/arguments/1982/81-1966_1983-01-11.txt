ORAL ARGUMENT OF LARRY E. FORRESTER, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER BELKNAP, INC.

8

MR. FORRESTER*

10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Courts
In January of 1978 the Petitioner Belknap

11

employed approximately 400 people in a bargaining unit

12

represented by the Teamsters Union.

On February 1st of

3

1978 the Teamsters called a strike of the bargaining

4

unit because the parties were unable to agree upon the

5

terms of a new collective bargaining agreement.

6

same date Belknap advertised in the local newspaper for

7

permanent replacements for these striking employees.

8

Simultaneously, Belknap implemented an across the board

9

wage increase for all employees in the bargaining unit.

20

On that

During the course of the strike there were

21

unfair labor practice charges filed against Belknap and

22

by Belknap against the union for conduct occurring on

23

the picket line.

24

Relations Board issued a complaint against Belknap,

25

contending that their unilateral wage increase at the

In April of 1978 the National Labor

1

inception of the strike was an unfair labor practice and

2

that it violated Belknap's duty to bargain with the

3

union.

4

In July of that year, before a hearing on

5

these unfair labor practice matters before the Labor

6

Board occurred, the regional director for the Labor

7

Board in Cincinnati directed the parties to the labor

8

dispute to attend a meeting at the regional's office in

9

Cincinnati and encouraged the parties to resume

10

negotiations to resolve the labor dispute.

As a result

11

of this meeting, concessions were made by both parties

12

concerning the terms of their collective bargaining

13

agreement.

14

by the employer.

There were compromises made by the union and

The ultimate issue between the parties that

15
16

separated them was the status of the strikers vis a vis

17

the status of the strike replacements.

18

position that the strike replacements would be

19

retained.

20

strikers should be returned to work.

21

unable to make an agreement on this issue.

22

It was Belknap's

The union, of course, contended that the
The parties were

The regional director for the Labor Board

23

suggested a compromise whereby Belknap would agree to

24

recall 35 striking employees per month, even though this

25

may require that the replacement employees be laid off.

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

On the basis of this compromise, the parties reached a

2

strike settlement agreement and settled the strike.

3

Part and parcel of this settlement was the withdrawal of

4

unfair labor practice charges by Belknap and by the

5

Teamsters Union.

6

concerning strike violence during the course of the

7

strike was dismissed.

8

dismissed in conjunction with the strike settlement

agr eement.

Also, related state court litigation

All pending litigation was

10

After this settlement agreement was

11

consummated, the replacements, represented by

12

Respondents herein, sued in state court, contending that

13

their layoff occasioned by the terms of the strike

14

settlement agreement constituted breaches of state law

15

concerning misrepresentation with regard to offering

16

them permanent employment in the first place, and also

17

breaches of contract with regard to terminating their

18

employment after they had been offered permanent

19

employment.

20

The trial court dismissed these state claims

21

upon the grounds that they were preempted by the

22

National Labor Relations Act.

23

Kentucky reversed, contending that the subject matter

24

concerned a matter of compelling state interest and was

25

of only peripheral concern to the National Labor

Relations Board
The Supreme Court of Kentucky ultimately

2
3

denied discretionary review, and it raises the issue for

4

this Court whether or not the state court claims are

5

preempted under the National Labor Relations Act.
QUESTION;

6

Mr. Forrester, may I ask, do you

7

know of any cases in which an action for failure

8

properly to represent has been brought against a union

9

by strike replacements?
MR. FORRESTER;

10
11

Justice Brennan.
QUESTION;

12
13

I know of no such case.

Neither Board nor state court or

federal court?

14

MR. FORRESTER;

I know of no such case.

15

QUESTION;

Yes.

16

QUESTION;

At that point the union — did it

17

owe any duties to anybody in the bargaining unit at that

18

point ?
MR. FORRESTER;

19

The union owed the duty of

20

fair representation to all members of the bargaining

21

unit.

22
23
24
25

Strike replacements are of course members —
QUESTION;

But wasn’t this in connection with

negotiating a new agreement?
MR. FORRESTER;

Yes.

Regardless of the

existence of a collective bargaining agreement, the

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

union owes duties to everybody in the bargaining unit.
QUESTION;

2
3

Well, even people who are hired as

replacements?
MB. FORRESTER;

4

Replacements have to be

5

considered members of a bargaining unit if they are —

6

they stand in the stead of the strikers.

7

represents everyone in the bargaining unit.
QUESTION;

8
9

The union

And yet, Mr. Forrester, how is this

striking union ever going to meet that duty?

If it

10

exercises or discharges it in favor of the strike

11

replacements, then isn’t it denying fair representation

12

to the strikers?
MR. FORRESTER;

13

Well, there is certainly a

14

conflict among the strikers and the replacement

15

workers.

16
17
18
19

20
21

But the —
QUESTION;

Well, that’s why I wonder.

I’ve

just never heard of a suit by strike replacements.
QUESTION;

Well, this is -- was there a suit

against the union?
MR. FORRESTER;

There was no suit against the

union by the strike replacements.

22

QUESTION;

Not here, though.

23

mean, this suit is against —

24

MR. FORRESTER;

25

QUESTION;

Not here.

I

This suit is against Belknap.

Yes, against the company.

1

MR. FORRESTER;

2

QUESTION;

That's correct.

Well, when these people were hired

3

was there any kind of a contract that would preclude

4

their being discharged, with or without cause?
MR. FORRESTER;

5

There was no such contract.

6

Belknap had to characterize their replacement status as

7

permanent in order to comply with the requirements of

8

federal law.
QUESTION;

9

Well, they did make the promise —

10

MR. FORRESTER;

11

QUESTION;

— you're going to be a permanent

13

QUESTION;

And they reiterated it.

14

MR. FORRESTER;

15

QUESTION;

16

MR. FORRESTER;

12

They did make the promise.

employee.

They did reiterate it.

And they also alleged fraud.
They did allege fraud, but

17

that was not the basis upon which the Court of Appeals

18

determined that they could sue in state court.

19

Court of Appeals said, by merely saying that you

20

promised them permanent replacement status and then

21

entering in a strike settlement agreement permitting

22

them to be discharged —

23

QUESTION;

24

MR. FORRESTER;

25

The

You've broken your contract.
-- they've stated a cause of

action.

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Under federal law, however, if we do not

1

2

characterize their status as permanent, then we may not

3

assert their employment status against any striker who

4

desires to return at any time, and for that reason we

5

are —

6

QUESTION:

Hell, but you don’t — that doesn’t

7

-- that’s just a privilege.

8

which you have to —

9
10
11

MR. FORRESTER:

That isn’t an obligation

Well, it’s a substantial

economic weapon.
QUESTION:

Well, it may be, but you’re not

12

obliged to, in hiring replacements, to say they’re going

13

to be permanent.

14
15
16

MR. FORRESTER:
so under Mackay Radio.
QUESTION:

All right, you're privileged, but

17

you’re not obligated to.

18

MR. FORRESTER:

19
20

Well, we are privileged to do

And if we do not so

characterize it, we do not have that economic weapon.
QUESTION:

Supposing, Mr. Forrester, that an

21

employer in the midst of what he knows is an unfair

22

labor practice strike wants to get replacement workers,

23

and suppose he gives each of the replacement workers

24

two-year contracts.

25

although he may know in the back of his mind that he may

That’s what he tells them, anyway,

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

have to reinstate the strikers by some sort of a

2

compromise settlement such as worked out here.

3

Does the enforcement in state court by the

4

replacement workers of that two-year contract -- how

5

does that, arguably or otherwise, interfere with the

6

National Labor Relations Act?

7

MR. FORRESTERs

Well, I suggest that a state

8

court’s inquiry into the subjective motivation of an

9

employer in those circumstances substantially interferes

10

with the line of preemption cases that permit employers

11

and labor unions to resort to economic weapons whenever

12

there’s a labor dispute.

13

QUESTIONS

Well, it doesn’t permit employers

14

to resort to fraud or breach of contract, though, in

15

dealing with a group of employees.

16

MR. FORRESTERs

I agree that it does not

17

permit that. Justice Rehnquist.

But — nor are states

18

permitted to inquire about employer motivations or union

19

motivations in exercising their economic weapons without

20

the risk of damaging the worth of these economic weapons

21

in a labor dispute.

22

QUESTION*

You say, then, that a replacement

23

worker who is hired by the employer, the employer in his

24

own mind knows, I am probably going to have to let this

25

guy go in about three months but I really need him, so

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

I'm going to tell him he can have the job for two years

2

because he’s got a job now and he wouldn’t leave it if I

3

told him it was just for three months, you're saying

4

that that employee has no cause of action, tort or

5

contract, when he is discharged after three months, in

6

state court?

7

MS. FORRESTER*

Promises of that sort may

8

conceivably be unfair labor practices, inasmuch as the

9

employer continues to have the duty to bargain with the

10

representative concerning --

11

QUESTION*

Yes, but my question was, can this

12

employee sue in state court for fraud or for breach of

13

contract?
MR. FORRESTER*

14
15

It is our position that he

cannot.

16

QUESTION*

How does that interfere with the

17

National Labor Relations Act?
MR. FORRESTER*

18

Because whenever a state court

19

is permitted to inquire into the subjective motivations

20

of an employer for offering permanent replacement

21

status, then the damage to that economic weapon is

22

done.

23
24
25

QUESTION*

What is subjective about a contract

of employment of two years?
MR. FORRESTER*

It’s the intention of the

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

employer with regard to that contract.

2

Rehnquist was suggesting that —
QUESTION;

3

Justice

Under the hypothesis that Justice

4

Rehnquist gave you, I thought he was just talking about

5

a flat-out contract for two years.

6

NR. FORRESTER;

I thought Justice Rehnquist

7

was suggesting that the employer knew that it was an

8

unfair labor practice strike and he could not reasonably

. 9

offer that employment contract.
QUESTION;

10

That might come into play, but he*s

11

made them a — there's nothing subjective or ambiguous

12

about an employment contract for two years, is there?
MR. FORRESTER;

13
14

Justice.
QUESTION;

15
16

There is not, Mr. Chief

Then why can't that be enforced in

state courts?
MR. FORRESTER;

17

Because any such contract

18

which would be in derogation of a collective bargaining

19

agreement is not enforceable.

20

bargaining agreement that prevails over any individual

21

contract.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION;

It's the collective

How is that in derogation of the

collective bargaining agreement?
MR. FORRESTER;

Hell, the employer — let’s

assume the employer enters a contract for two years as

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

you suggest, and subsequently negotiates the terms and

2

conditions for that unit.

3

two-year contract goes by the wayside.
QUESTIONi

4

Then the promise of a

Could I ask you, suppose there

5

hadn't been a settlement, but the employer held out and

6

the strike -- he just broke the strike by hiring these

7

replacements, all of whom he promised permanent jobs to,

8

and so the strike was over.

9

these people he had promised as permanent replacements.
HR. FORRESTERi

10

And then he started firing

Well, in the context of this

11

case the Board would have pursued the unfair labor

12

practice.

13

QUESTIONi

No, but let's just assume no unfair

14

labor practice.

15

an economic strike and the employer won.

16

permanent replacements and then he decided that, now

17

that he's hired them all, he'd like to take back some of

18

the old workers because they were better.

19

fires the — do you think he could do that?

20
21

22

Nobody’d even filed one.

HR. FORRESTERi

It was just
He hired

So he just

QUESTIONi

What do you mean, may be?

It's

23

either yes or no.

If it's preempted one way, it's

24

preempted the other, it seems to me.

25

saying is that giving them a remedy for breach of

contract burdens the employer’s right to hire

2

replacements.

3

his promise, he won't be so free to make them, and that

4

burdens his right to hire replacements.

5

your argument, and it's also the Board's argument, I

6

take it.

If he knows he's going to have to pay for

MR . FORRESTER;

7

That has to be

The argument is that he will

8

be effectively deprived of the economic weapon of

offering permanent employment status to strike

replacements.
QUESTION;

11

You mean lying about it.

12

going to be deprived of the right'to break his

13

contract.

14
15

MR. FORRESTER;

I suggest that the likelihood

of an employer —

QUESTION;

17

18

Yes, he's

That is an interesting piece of a

MR. FORRESTER;

I suggest that the likelihood

19

of an employer being in a position to cynically predict

20

down the road what is going to happen in a labor dispute

21

is not great.

22

QUESTION;

It isn't cynically, but all he

23

would have to do to protect himself, and he may not be

24

able to hire replacements, but he would have to say;

25

Look, this is certainly my promise to you;

I'll keep

you if I can, but if it turns out that I've got an

2

unfair labor practice charge made out against me I'm

3

going to have to can you.

4

That maybe is a big burden, but I'm not sure

5

how much it is.

6

burden, and so do you.

Apparently the Board thinks it's a big

7

MB. FORRESTER*

8

either in that context or another;

9

determines to hire permanent replacements, he continues

I do, and the problem arises
Once an employer

10

to have the obligation to bargain with the union about

11

the terms and conditions of employment for members of

12

the bargaining unit.

13

disinclined to make that —

14

QUESTION;

An employer would be substantially

Well, he doesn't if he wins the

15

strike and he's hired replacements who aren't a member

16

of the union.

17

HR. FORRESTER;

If the strike is over and no

18

bargaining obligation continues, he is relieved of that

19

risk and that responsibility and the mandate under the

20

Federal Labor Act.

21

QUESTION*

It's your position that in order to

22

really deal with the union and fight his battle during

23

the strike, all bets are off so far as other areas of

24

the law are concerned, really.

25

defraud people or to breach contracts with third parties

The employer is free to

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

so far as the beginning of the strike is concerned, in

2

order that he can concentrate his maximum effort with

3

the least possible financial burden on the union, or on

4

the employer?
MR. FORRESTERi

5

Obviously, there is some sort

6

of egregious conduct that should be subject to state

7

law .

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. FORRESTER:

10

Hell, how about fraud?
In the context of this case, I

do not believe that was an element.
QUESTION:

11

Well, what about just straight

12

contract?

13

weapons, but why shouldn’t you say he is free to use

14

those economic weapons that are within the law?

15

certainly promising somebody, somebody a two-year job,

16

knowing that you’re going to can him if you make a

17

settlement, why shouldn’t he have to pay for breaking

18

his contract?

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Sure, the employer is free to use economic

KR. FORRESTER:

And

Well, in this case there were

no two-year contracts.
QUESTION:

Well, it was even worse.

There was

the promise of permanent employment.
MR. FORRESTER:

As is required in order for an

employer to preserve that economic weapon.
QUESTION:

Not required.

It's just your

privilege
QUESTIONj

2

Has there been any judicial

3

determination with respect to whether there was or was

4

not a contract here?

5

MR. FORRESTER:

6

QUESTION:

7

There has not been.

The case hasn’t been tried yet on

the state claim?

8

MR. FORRESTER:

9

QUESTION:

It has not been tried yet.

Yes, but as the case comes to us,

10

the case is presented to us, there was a promise of

11

permanent employment.

12

MR. FORRESTER:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. FORRESTER:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. FORRESTER:

17

There was a promise of —

And reiterated.
And reiterated.

You concede that?
I do concede that, Justice

Whi te .

18

If the employer had not done so, then he would

19

not have been able to assert the rights of the permanent

20

replacements against the striking employees.
QUESTION:

21

22

25

But the

law didn’t require him to make that promise.
MR. FORRESTER:

23
24

We all understand that.

No.

It permitted him to do

so.
QUESTION:

We have to proceed on the

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

assumption that there is a probability or a possibility

2

that a contract will be established in the proceedings

3

in the future.
HR. FORRESTER!

4

If there is a contract in the

5

proceedings in the future, it is of course in contrast

6

with a collective bargaining agreement that covers the

7

same terms and conditions of employment.
QUESTION!

8

9

Well, anything to prevent a person

from making inconsistent contracts with two different

10

people at the same time?

11

MR. FORRESTER!

12

is nothing to prohibit it.
QUESTION!

13
14

No, Hr. Chief Justice, there

If he breaches one of them, then

he's going to be liable on that one.
MR. FORRESTER!

15

But a collective bargaining

16

agreement always prevails over any individual employment

You don't say that this is

preempted because there’s any — that the employer was

doing something that was expressly prohibited or

permitted, protected by the Act in the normal sense of

the word?

That’s your position, isn’t it?

2

ME. FORRESTER;

3

QUESTION;

Hot entirely, Justice White.

What is the unfair labor practice

4
5

MR. FORRESTER;

If as a matter of law, as the

6

Labor Board contended, .that the strike was converted to

7

an unfair labor practice strike with the offer of the

8

wage increase on the 1st of February, then the mere

9

offering of permanent employment to replacement strikers

10

according to the Labor Board is an unfair labor

11

practice.
QUESTION;

12

Had the unfair labor practice

13

proceeding continued to attend, you’re — and you’d been

14

found guilty of an unfair labor practice, you may have

15

been subject to an order of the Board to reinstate the

16

strikers?
MR. FORRESTER;

17

The Regional Director so

18

advised Belknap in their conference where the issues

19

were settled.
QUESTION;

20
21

Even after you had made the

promises of permanent employment to the replacements?

22

MR. FORRESTER;

23

QUESTION;

That’s correct.

Let's assume that's — let's assume

24

that's so.

That still leaves the question of the people

25

that the employer promised to hire permanently* and what

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

has the Board got to do with that?

2

MR. FORRESTERi

Zero.

Well, it's unlikely that the

3

Board has unfair labor practice jurisdiction to

4

entertain claims of —
QUESTION;

5
6

They couldn't possibly give a

remedy —

7

MR. FORRESTER*

8

QUESTION*

9
10

11

could they,

Unless —

— to the permanent employees,

to the permanent replacements?

There's just

no remedy they could give them.
MR. FORRESTER*

They certainly would not be

12

entitled to remedies that would be a satisfactory state

13

court claim.

14

QUESTION*

Well, that really doesn't — you're

15

not suggesting that there's any — that the employer was

16

even arguably committing an unfair labor practice with

17

respect to the permanent employees that he said he was

18

hiring, or the permanent replacements?

19

MR. FORRESTER*

If in fact and in law it were

20

an unfair labor practice at the time these offers were

21

made, then the Board's position is that it's an unfair

22

labor practice to offer permanent employment status to

23

replacements.

24
25

QUESTION*

Well, it may be, it may be.

But

it's not — say one of the permanent replacements,

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

so-called permanent replacements, came in and filed a

2

charge with the Regional Director or the General Counsel

3

that, this employer is committing an unfair labor

4

practice against me.

5

wouldn't he?

6

this down to the state court and file your suit down

7

there.

Not laughed; he'd just say, sorry, take

MR. FORRESTER*

8

9

He'd be laughed out of the room,

I'm not sure the Labor Board

would say that, but it's unlikely a replacement would

10

file such a charge.

11

QUESTION;

Exactly, yes.

12

QUESTION*

Mr. Forrester, may I ask you a

13

question.

There's an issue, isn't there, as to whether

14

it was an unfair labor practice strike or an economic

15

strike at the time of the hiring of the permanent

16

replacements?
MR. FORRESTER*

17

The issue had been raised.

I

18

don *t know at the time that the bulk of the replacements

19

were hired that the charge had been filed on the

20

unilateral increase.
QUESTION;

21

I'm just wondering if the character

22

of the strike would have any impact on your preemption

23

argument, because one kind of strike might give rise to

24

an arguable violation and another kind of strike might

25

not.

And if that's true and if we don't yet know until

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the trial is had what kind of a strike it is, is it

2

perfectly clear we have a final judgment?

3
4
5

MR. FORRESTER:

Well, it is clear that the

federal issue is decided.
QUESTION:

You don't think the federal issue

6

could be affected by any of the proceedings that take

7

place hereafter?

8
9

MR. FORRESTER:

The only issue that would be

subject to exploration with regard to these claims is

10

any question of fraud underlying an employer's

11

motivation in offering permanent employment.

12

that once the state court is permitted to make that

13

inquiry in the context of a labor dispute, then the harm

14

is done, because any state in the — any court in this

15

union whenever permanent replacements are hired may

16

inquire as to what the employer intended and there is no

17

longer any federal privilege as we understand it now to

18

hire permanent replacements without risk of being sued

19

in state court for fraud.

I suggest

MR- ALITO;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the court»
The National Labor Relations Board agrees that

4

Respondents* state claims are preempted by federal law.

5

He reach this conclusion primarily because those claims

6

would frustrate the policy of federal labor law by

7

interfering to an impermissible degree with one of the

8

chief economic weapons granted to employers in labor

disputes, that is, the right to hire permanent strike

QUESTION*

The right to be dishonest in the

process or what?
MR. ALITO;

No, Your Honor, I don’t think this

case involves any dishonesty on the part —
QUESTION:

The right to promise -- the right

16

to make a contractual promise that he knows he may not

17

be able to keep?

18

MR. ALITO;

An employer certainly does not

19

have that right under federal law, but it may be that,

20

and we contend that it is, it is the case —

21

QUESTION;

You say that he may be able to make

22

this promise, which the federal law may prevent him from

23

keeping, and yet he is not liable for his promise to

somebody else, which is probably or perhaps has enticed

25

somebody to leave another job?

1

ME. ALITO*

Well, Your Honor, we maintain that

2

suits like the present one are preempted.

3

it's misleading to suggest that employers can engage in

fraudulent conduct towards strike replacements.

about fraud, then.

the federal law may keep — prevent them from keeping.

Of course, the federal law doesn’t prevent them from

They just stand like anybody else in life does; if he

Why should he not make somebody whole that he
has damaged?
MR. ALITOs

Well, Your Honor, let me make

17

several points in response to that.

18

it is not a false promise for an employer in this

19

context to state to a strike replacement that he is

20

going to be given the position of a so-called permanent

21

replacement.

22
23

First, it is not —

That is —

QUESTION:

Well, let’s say it wasn't false.

It was certainly erroneous, was it not?
MR. ALITO:
Your Honor.

I don’t believe it was erroneous.

It is a term of art in federal labor law.

Oh, so you're saying anybody who

What we are — that might also be the case.

10

argued.
MR. ALITO*

8

9

Well, that might be the case.

Well, what I'm saying is that in

this case there was no — there was no fraud on the
strike replacements.
QUESTION*

11

Mr. Alito, are you familiar with

12

the opinion of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in this

13

case?

14

MR. ALITOs

15

QUESTION*

Yes, I am.
Well, in the second paragraph,

16

which you will find, I believe, on page 1 of the

17

appendices to the petition, after the beginning of the

18

paragraph cites the names of the parties, it says, "The

19

action alleged fraud, misrepresentation and breach of

20

con tract."

21

Was the Kentucky Court of Appeals wrong in

22

describing the action that had been filed in the

23

Kentucky trial court?

24
25

MR. ALITOs

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

But

if you look at the complaint and you see what the basis

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

for the fraud claim was and the basis for the

2

contractual claim, you will see that the basis for the

3

fraud claim, and as far as we can determine the sole

4

basis for the fraud claim, is the advertisement that

5

Belknap placed in the newspaper.

6

an appendix to the brief we submitted at the petition

7

stage.

8

9
10

QUESTION!

That is reproduced as

Well, does Kentucky have the same

sort of rules of procedure that the federal courts do,
do you know?

11

MR. ALITO*

12

QUESTIONi

I don’t know. Your Honor.
If it does, certainly any number of

13

amounts of evidence or theories could be adduced in

14

support of a pleading of fraud.

15

you’re not limited to a particular advertisement.

16

shouldn’t the state courts have the right to find out

17

what the case is about?

18
19

20

You don't have to —
Why

Apparently you concede that many kinds of
fraud would be actionable in state court, don’t you?
MR. ALITO*

Well, I don’t want to belabor the

21

characterization of the facts of the case.

I simply

22

wanted to point out that it is a bit misleading to

23

suggest that this case, which we believe is typical, is

24

an instance in which an employer is even alleged to have

25

engaged in what is really fraudulent conduct.

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION;

1

Well, then you do say that the

2

Kentucky Court of Appeals was wrong when it described

3

this action as alleging fraud, misrepresentation and

4

breach of contract.

5

HR. ALITO;

I don’t disagree with their

6

characterization of what was alleged.

I think it is

7

apparent, however, from the face of the complaint that

8

what is really at issue is the right to offer "permanent

9

placements to strike replacements."

And that is

10

precisely what this Court said an employer could do in

11

an economic strike.

12

QUESTION;

13

Of

course he can do that.

14
15

Certainly he could do that.

QUESTION;

That doesn't mean he’s not liable

if he breaches —

16

QUESTION:

What remedy do the Respondents have

17

under federal law if they have no remedy in state

18

court?

19

HR. ALITO;

Your Honor, there is one possible

20

remedy.

It was touched on this morning.

It's the

21

filing of a claim against the union for breach of the

22

duty of fair representation.

23

QUESTION;

I don’t want to —

You don’t seriously argue that the

24

union has a duty to represent the replacements, do you,

25

Mr. Alito?

1
2
3

MR. ALITOj

Me contend that they have a duty

to represent them in certain respects.
But the point that I really want to make in

4

response to that question is that the filing of unfair

5

labor practice charges by a union in any instance in

6

which an employer promises more than federal law

7

permits, and therefore more than he will be able to

8

deliver, will probably prompt the union to file unfair

9

labor practice charges and that will serve to police

10

these offers by employers to permanent strike

11

replacements.

12

QUESTIONi

Well, your position must be that no

13

suit in the state courts in these circumstances may be

14

maintained, whether it's for fraud, misrepresentation,

15

breach of contract or anything else.

16

MR. ALITOi

That is our position, Your Honor.

17

It's been suggested that the employer has a duty to

18

provide some sort of explanation to the strike

19

replacements as to what their status is, to tell them

20

something more than that they are being employed as

21

so-called permanent strike replacements.

22

point of view that would be unworkable and really

23

intolerable, if an employer were required to supply a

24

prospective strike replacement with an accurate,

25

comprehensive, understandable synopsis of the rights of

strike replacements and strikers and employers in

2

economic strikes and unfair labor practice strikes.

3

The risk of misstatement, the risk that a

4

state court would find that there had been misstatement,

5

would be so great that the employers' use of this

6

permitted economic weapon of hiring permanent strike

7

replacements would be grievously impaired.

8

for that reason that we maintain that employers are

9

permitted to offer strike replacements permanent

asked your colleague*

— because it does not interfere

1

can’t fire them will dampen his ability to offer

2

permanent replacement status to people during a strike.

3

MR. ALITO*

Well, Justice White, in answer to

4

that question and another question that was asked when

5

Mr. Forrester was speaking, we certainly don't maintain

6

that employers are given carte blanche and are

7

absolutely free from the constraints of state law to

8

promise anything to anybody in the name of maintaining

9

an economic weapon during a labor dispute.

10

And I think

that is analogous to a fraudulent promise to a third

11 __ par ty.
12

QUESTION*

So suppose there are unfair labor

13

practice charges filed by the union, who claim that he

14

committed unfair labor practice and that he's offering

15

permanent replacements to people that he has no business

16

offering them to.

17

that the employer's committed nothing, no unfair labor

18

practice at all.

19

permanent replacements.

20

And they litigate that and it’s found

He was quite permitted to offer these

HR. ALITOs

And then he fires them.

Your Honor, I think my answer to

21

that question is that that is a different case, because

22

when the strike is over there is not the same degree of

23

interference with a permitted economic weapon.

24
25

QUESTION*

Well, the strike is over now.

The

strike is over now by a settlement, and he fires the

QUESTIONS

4

HR. ALITOi

Well, future strikes —
It's all over.
Future strikes are not over, and

5

if it is known that state actions like this one are

6

permitted there will be an intolerable degree of

7

interference with an employer's economic weapon.
QUESTIONS

8
9

Let me test your position with a

slight hypothetical change here.

Suppose, since many

10

people are reluctant to break a picket line, the

11

employer had announced in that announcement that's in

12

your appendix here a $500 premium, special payment, will

13

be made for all replacements.

14

there they negotiate and agree that the $500 payment

15

will be deferred, but they all go to work just as they

16

did here.

17

And then when they get

And then the employer doesn't pay the $500,

18

independent of whether he's fired them or not.

19

they sue for that $500 in state court?

20

MR. ALITOs

Could

I believe that would be preempted

21

on the same theory.

22

conduct that is arguably prohibited by Section 8 and

23

would be preempted under the Garmon rule.

24
25

QUESTION;

I think that certainly involves

You don't know of any other cases

like this, where you just say it's just one of those

1

areas a state court should stay out of, it isn't

2

specifically arguably prohibited or protected?
MR. ALITO:

3

Machinists is certainly comparable

4

to this in many respects.

5

Congress' intent not to permit state regulation was

6

inferred from the fact that burdening a particular

7

economic weapon would frustrate the policies of the

8

Act.

And that we contend is what would happen here.

concerning this case, and it’s bothered me for some

today, and I feel more at ease.

15

the holy grail of National Labor Relations Board

22

QUESTION!

Mr. Davenport, could I ask you,

23

suppose the federal labor law said that in a strike,

24

during a strike until it's — at least up until a

25

certain point in a strike, an employer may hire

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

replacements, but he may not hire anybody on a permanent

2

basis.

Just suppose the federal law said that.
Then the employer nevertheless, in hiring

3
4

replacements, promises a permanent job.

5

wouldn't say that that contract would be enforceable if

6

it's just -- if it’s an illegal contract, would you?
MR. DAVENPORT;

7

No, because it would have been

8

preempted by the federal Act.

9

QUESTION ;

10

Now, you

Well, it was just made an illegal

contract.

11

MR. DAVENPORTi

12

QUESTION;

That is correct.

Well, as I understand the

13

submission on the other side here, that when an unfair

14

labor practice charge is pending such as was pending in

15

this case, it really was an unfair practice, namely,

16

contrary to federal law to promise a permanent job, in

17

which event if that — assume that it turned out that

18

way, that, true, there was an unfair practice and the

19

employer should not run around hiring permanent

20

replacements.
Now, it's tough on the 400 replacements, but

21

22

nevertheless they made an illegal contract with the

23

employer.

24
25

MR. DAVENPORT;

Justice White, I could be

wrong, but the statement was made earlier by my

colleague that this was a violation.

is a violation to give a raise, but it is not — and I

cannot recall any case that ever spoke of making

an unfair labor practice.

is that the right that’s being protected here is the

right to promise permanent —
MB. DAVENPORT;

That is correct.

And.again,

10

I'd like to reiterate, it is an unfair labor practice to

11

give a blanket raise because that is inducement to the

12

outside to come in and an unfair economic weapon, if you

13

will.

14

types of promises that can be made to replacement

15

employees being an unfair labor practice.

But I know of no case that ever spoke of the

QUESTION;

16

How do you distinguish in terms of

people?

20

What's the difference?
MB. DAVENPORT;

Well, apparently under the

21

overall policy and regulations laid down by the Board,

22

the offer of a wage is an unfair inducement to entice

23

off the picket line those back in.

24

replacement employees per se would not likewise be an

25

inducement.

But the hiring of

I mean, it might be a threat to them, but

35

it is certainly not an inducement.
What we have here is attempting to broaden the

2

3

scope and the jurisdiction of the National Labor

4

Relations Board under the guise of the broad terms

5

"arguably protected" or under the broad terms of the

6

necessity to give economic weapons and create a detente,

7

so to speak, a philosophical theory of governing the

8

labor peace.

9

Now, this has been going on for a long time.
«

10

But it is inconceivable to us that in this process, if

11

the theory of the NLRB were taken and if it were

12

sanctioned by this Court, it is inconceivable that there

13

could be 400 people in these United States that would

14

not be treated in the same substantial fashion as the

15

rest of the population.

16

How are these people, for instance, to know

17

that they must govern themselves in dealing with an

18

employer in an entirely different situation if he has a

19

strike going than they would be correspondingly required

20

to deal with that same employer when there is no strike

21

in evidence?

22

QUESTIONS

Well, it might be stretching it a

23

little bit when it embraces all the policies of the

24

Labor Boari or any regulatory agency, but are they not

25

obliged to know the law?

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. DAVENPORT;

1

Yes, they are.

And I submit

2

that it is their prerogative to assume that the law

3

would be applied in the same fashion to that employer

4

with regard to telling the truth and not telling the

5

truth during a strike time as it would be applied to

6

that same employer were it to be outside of that strike

7

time.

That's all we're saying.

MR. DAVENPORT;

10

Well, it is not as they

contend, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

13

the right to give out false information in order to

14

induce hordes of people to come to work for him as

15

replacements, then it would be incumbent upon the

16

parties under that posture to know what that law was,

That is correct. Justice

This is a suit in tort, labeled and hopingly

Would your position on that, your

11

position as distinguished from the Board, mean that an

12

action for tort might be maintained but an action for

14

recovery or a suit for contract alone might be

15

preempted, but a suit for tort for fraud would not be?

16

Could it not be reasonable that

HR. DAVENPORT*

I think not, Mr. Chief

17

Justice, because the position of the Board is that

18

arguably because this arose out of a time when a labor

19

dispute was going on, then under the concept of Garmon

20

and under the Act and the amendments that is preempted,

21

simply because it arose.

22

And may I point out where that is in error.

23

We’ve relied greatly upon Linn versus United Plant Guard

24

Workers of America, and let me quote from that, page 663

25

of that opinion*

"Nor should the fact that defamation"

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

this was a tort; this was a defamation action between

2

a manager of a plant on the employer after the strike

3

was over against the union for libel and slander with

4

regard to leaflets, et cetera, and this Court says;
"Nor should the fact that defamation arises

5
6

during a labor dispute give the Board exclusive

7

jurisdiction to remedy its consequences."

8

9

So just because -- and that's what they're
really saying, that tort actions, which the states have

10

had original jurisdiction since the inception of the

11

Constitution, has been diminished, or jurisdiction over

12

those torts and/or contracts, has been diminished to the

13

extent that it' has been preempted by the provisions of

14

the Act.

15

And all we are saying is that this could never

16

arguably be of any problem to the Board in extending its

17

jurisdiction to mediate the peace of a labor industry as

18

long as you require the employer simply to tell the

19

truth and be honest about it.

20

harm to the overall administration of the Act.

21

torts have been brought.

22

It doesn't afford any
And

I think we have to, if I may, analyze the

23

cases that have been decided by this Court previously.

24

The principal case is that of Linn versus United Plant

25

Guard Workers of America, and this was a case in which

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the manager of the employer’s plant after a strike

2

brought suit for defamation of character/ libel and

3

slander against the union for the dissemination of

4

leaflets and scandalous material in those leaflets

5

concerning him during a strike.
And the Court held that that tort could be

6

7

litigated by state court under two or three different

8

theories# number one being it was such a complete

9

concern to the respective states that it was not

10

arguably within the purview or would not disturb the

11

overall policy of the labor movement by allowing the

12

states, which had a greater concern than did the labor

13

movement with regard to that particular type of action.

14

Now, let's consider — and there are only two

15

-- there are only really four cases on which torts have

16

been allowed.

17

those, they would have been allowed except the facts

18

were not appropriate, the Linn being the principal

19

case.

neither give any remedy or offer any relief to the

18

Now, there were some dissimilar factors

19

between the Linn case and our case.

the Linn case, the NLRB does take recognition of libel

with the strike, and he recovered in that case.

6

In Rotor Coach Employees versus Lockridge, a

union member sued the union.

overturned by this Court, with fair comment that had the

9

state court been able to consider only the constitution

10

of the union that it would have been a matter which they

11

had jurisdiction of; however, they had to consider a

12

security clause of a contract and had to rely upon that

13

for adjudication, and the Court felt that that was

14

arguably within the purview of the NLRB.

15

Employees versus Lockridge favorably commented upon the

16

right of Lockridge to sue,

3

the Court in that case favorably commented upon his

right to sue in tort, however, reviewed the proof and

5

decided that the proof called for the state court to

rely upon apparent unemployment discrimination — I mean

7

employment discrimination -- and therefore, while the

8

Court sanctioned the right of the state court to

9

adjudicate pure tort, if in doing so the state.court had
o

10

to pass upon an employment discrimination matter they

11

felt that that was arguably within the jurisdiction of

12

and preempted by the NLRB.

13

I*m citing these because I think, that these

14

five cases graphically set forth what the Court's

15

progress up to this time has been, and that in two of

16

these cases state courts were allowed to adjudicate

17

tort; in two other of these cases the state court — the

18

ability of state court to do so was approved, however,

19

the case was overturned because there was reliance on

20

matters which was arguably under the preemption doctrine

21

of the NLRB.

22

So I’m saying it is our position that tort has

23

been allowed before, tort has been allowed under, for a

24

better expression, thinner cases and circumstances than

25

this; and that our only position is one which could
