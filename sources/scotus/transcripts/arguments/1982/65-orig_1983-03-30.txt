MR. TOWNSEND;

I do not believe that he

QUESTION;

The language is unclear, is it

not ?
MR. TOWNSEND;

It *s — the Master found the

double mass to be an accoun ting procedure useful in the

10

inflow-outflow method.

11

some language that the engi neer advisors to the Compact

12

negotiators used in their r eport, and based on their

13

statement the allocation sh ouldn't be based on a

14

straight line he felt it wa s not proper for him to use

15

the double mass.

16

How ever, he was concerned about

Texas contends th at Texas has addressed the

17

concerns of the engineer ad visors and that double mass

18

is based upon a curvolinear basis as opposed to

19

straight-line percentage.

20

Master has not rejected the double mass on its merits,

21

He — there are not suffici ent findings in his report to

22

reach that conclusion.

23

Texas believes that the

The primary position of Texas is that this

24

suit not be dismissed and that the Court retain

25

jurisdiction so that the disputes between the states may

be resolved by whatever means the Court deems

appropriate.

3

alternative is to take — to try to take steps to

4

institute an equitable apportionment of the waters of

5

the Pecos River between the states.

If the suit is dismissed, Texas* only

However, Article XIY of the Compact provides

that it takes the action of the legislatures of both

11

this Court has jurisdiction to continue the suit to a

12

complete resolve of the disputes concerning the

13

Compact.

14

However, Texas believes that

Texas accepted the Master's recommendation

15

that a tie-breaker vote be placed upon the Commission.

16

This was not a Texas idea.

17

but Texas accepted that as a practical solution to an

18

ongoing problem.

19

prefer to rely upon the argument of the Master contained

20

in his report for support of that recommendation.

Texas has never argued this,

Because this is not a Texas idea, we

21

Texas would like to move-to its alternative

exceptions in the event the Court does not accept the

Master's recommendation that a tie-breaker vote be

placed upon the Commission.

25

3UESTI0Ni

In other words, you feel we have

6
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the power to impose that tie-breaker proposition, even

2

though this is -a compact between states?

3

MR. TOWNSENDj

Yes, Your Honor.

We feel that

4

you do have the power to do that because it would carry

5

out the express intent and purpose of the Compact, and

6

those primary purposes were to provide an equitable

7

apportionment of the use of the waters, and to remove

8

the causes of present and future controversies.

9

QUESTION;

10

Commission?

11

agree?

12

What is the basic trouble with the

Why can’t the states’ representatives

MR. TOWNSENDs

As the Master has found, the

13

good faith differences as far as engineering judgments

14

as to the procedure to implement or to determine whether

15

or not compliance with the Compact is continuing.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Certainly the Compact is deficient,

isn’t it, in this respect?
MR. TOWNSEND:

It’s deficient.

This

19

particular compact, like many other compacts, provides

20

for a unanimous vote, and there are no mechanisms to

21

resolve impasses when the commissioners cannot agree.

22

QUESTION;

So the — either you appoint a

23

tie-breaker or you make the determination yourself that

24

the Commission should make.

25

MR. TOWNSEND:

Your Honor, I believe that the

That's your second suggestion,

MR. TOWNSEND;

6

QUESTION;

7

MR. TOWNSEND;

8

Our second suggestion is that

And proceed to determine the —
Whether or not New Mexico has

fulfilled its obligations.
QUESTION;

9

That necessarily requires --

And to do that despite the fact

10

that the Compact calls for that decision to be made by

11

the Commission?
MR. TOWNSEND;

12

The Commission is granted the

13

power to make certain factfindings concerning the

14

obligations.
QUESTION:

15
16

But you think we have the authority

to take the place of the Commission in that respect?

17

MR. TOWNSEND;

18

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor, because --

Just like we have the authority to

19

appoint a tie-breaker, you think.

20

MR. TOWNSEND;

Well, I think it’s within this

21

Court's jurisdiction to fashion remedies to resolve the

22

dispute.

23

QUESTION;

Yes.

24

QUESTION;

Well, where is — what's the source

25

All right.

of our authority to appoint a tie-breaker?

It's not the

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

compact itself by construction, is it?

2

MR . TOWNSEND:

3

QUESTION:

4

NR. TOWNSEND:

Not any specific terms other

than

7

8

You can't construe the compact as

authorizing ?

5

6

It's not — you’re right —

QUESTION:

Well, then, what do you think, is

the source of our authority to appoint a tie-breaker?

9

MR. TOWNSEND:

According to the Master, it's

10

your equitable powers to do the essence of equity, is to

11

do equity and fashion a mode.

12

QUESTION:

13

that.

Well, he cited nothing to support

Do you have anything to suggest?

14

MR. TOWNSEND:

The only other thing that I

15

have to suggest that is the case of Virginia versus West

16

Virginia, which has been cited by the parties for the

17

proposition that the Court can enforce its judgments

18

even though that may require or involve state

19

governmental instrumentalities.
QUESTION:

20

And you don't think that's

21

different in the case of -- don't you think that's

22

different where the states themselves have entered into

23

a compact?

24

states, I could see the merit in your argument, but is

25

that true when there's a compact that the states have

*

If this had just been a dispute between the

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

entered into?

2

MR. TOWNSEND:

Well, in Virginia versus West

3

Virginia there was a compact, and the court, in reaching

4

its conclusion, held that the congressional power to

5

consent to agreements between the states necessarily

6

implied the congressional power to legislate an

7

enforcement of that compact.

8

that the fact that Congress can legislate a solution

9

does not prevent the court from exercising its

But the court determined

10

jurisdiction under Article III to resolve a controversy

11

between the states.

12

QUESTION:

When you strip the form away from

13

this idea of a tie-breaker, wouldn't the tie-breaker in

14

effect be a super-special master who would merely advise

15

this Court in which way to break the tie?
MR. TOWNSEND:

16

I would envision the

17

tie-breaker to be an ongoing participant in the

18

Commission.
QUESTION :

19

Well, then it would be contrary to

20

Vermont against New York and to other cases from this

21

Court.
MR. TOWNSEND:

22

23
24
25

If he's viewed as an arbiter.

yes .
QUESTION:

As a super-special master

Certainly then it would be outside

10

QUESTION:

Don't we have to declare the

compact unenforceable, non-enforceable?
MR. TOWNSEND:
QUESTION:

To do --

I don’t see how we can act under

11

the compact.

12

could understand, but to say that we are a tie-breaker

13

under the compact to me is not quite correct, because

14

it’s not mentioned in the compact.

15

If you get rid of the compact, then I

QUESTION:

Where would you find the authority

16

to — where would you find the authority to, if we

17

didn't appoint a tie-breaker, to go ahead and exercise

18

the authority of the Commission?

19

MR. TOWNSEND.*

Well, I believe that it’s a

20

controversy between the states, be it, even though the

21

Compact is involved, is within the-Court's jurisdiction

22

under Article III, controversies between the states.
t

23

Texas has alleged that New Mexico has violated

24

the Compact.

In order to determine whether or not New

25

Mexico has violated the Compact, there must be an

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

implementation of the Master's definition of the

2

condition to create the numerical standard by which

3

compliance can be measured.

4

QUESTIQN«

*47

Well, why would this be much

5

different -- why is what Texas is asking much different

6

than saying there is a dispute between New Mexico and

7

Texas over the apportionment of water and just like if

8

you're litigating that without a compact you would look

9

at the boundary that Congress has established between

10

Texas and New Mexico to decide, you know, where the

11

Pecos flows from New Mexico into Texas?

12

Here, in addition, you've got another statute

13

of Congress, a compact, which says something about the

14

water rights in the states.

15

simply treat that the same way he does the boundary

16

statute and say we’ve got two Federal statutes here and

17

we've got to work with them?

18

MR. TOWNSENDi

Why coulin't the Master

I believe that he can, and that

19

has been our — that's the argument of our alternative

20

exceptions,

21

necessary in the inquiry of has there been a violation

22

of the Compact, and in Texas’ opinion that is a judicial

23

inquiry, a judicial function and was stated in Prentiss

24

versus Atlantic Coast Lines, 211 U.S. 210, a 1908 case.

that the determination of the measure is

t

25

We have not cited that, but in that case it

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

States that a judicial inquiry investigates, declares,

2

and enforces liabilities based upon past or present

3

facts and under existing law.

4

contends that that is the situation with this law suit,

5

that the Compact could have been written without a

6

Commission to make a factfinding, and it would have

7

been — the duty would have been upon the states to do

8

their own accounting to see that there was compliance,

9

and if the statas felt like there was non-compliance

And I believe that Texas

10

then its remedy is exactly what it is today under the

11

Compact.

12

QUESTION;

If one state accuses the other

13

state of violating the compact, the only way you can get

14

redress is for the other state to admit they did wrong.

15

Is that what the Compact says?

16

MR. TOWNSEND;

Well, Your Honor, I think it

17

would also encompass us proving that the other state did

18

wrong.

19

Commission are not conclusive in any court.

20

specifically provides that, so the Compact negotiators

21

were anticipating court action to enforce the Compact.

22

There are no enforcement powers in the Pecos

The Compact provides that the findings of the
It

23

River Commission as enforcement powers are in the usual

24

range of federal administrative agencies and others.

25

QUESTION:

Well, is there anything more to it

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

than verbiage about a tie-breaker?

2

I just will decide this as the Master and he had not

3

said a tie-breaker.

4
5

MR. TOWNSEND:

Suppose it said that

We have been requesting the

Master to do exactly that, Your Honor.

6

QUESTION:

That’s what I thought.

7

MR. TOWNSEND:

And we have argued that the

8

Court should make that decision, that it can make that

9

decision, but we accepted his recommendation because it

10

seemed to be a practical solution.

11

The -- Texas is, as I said --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. TOWNSEND*.

14

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question right here?
Yes, Your Honor.

Is it correct that what the

15

tie-breaker would do would be to resolve disputes on

16

some of these underlying findings, how much water was

17

available in 1947 and so forth?

18

you would submit to the tie-breaker that the Master

19

could not himself decide if he didn't suggest that he

20

wasn’t — didn’t have the expertise to do so?

21

this rather strange paragraph in his opinion, that it’s

22

an awfully tough case and he doesn’t have the expertise

23

to decide it.

24
25

MR. TOWNSEND:

Is there any issue that

He has

That's right. Your Honor.

Texas believes that the Master can make any of the

14
ALDERSCN REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

decisions necessary in determining whether or not the

2

Compact has been violated.

3

QUESTION :

It would seem to me that both sides

4

really are in agreement on that, if I*m not mistaken.

5

The only person who’s balking is the Master.

6

7

MR. TOWNSEND*
That's the case.

8
9

It appears to be, Your Honor.

The United States has —

QUESTION*

The United States says the same

thing.

10

MR. TOWNSEND*

— contends that this Court has

11

jurisdiction to continue the law suit and to make all

12

necessary determinations in that suit.

3
4

QUESTION:

How many days has he actually spent

in hearings on this case since it was last here?

5

SR. TOWNSEND:

Last March we had approximately

6

two weeks of hearings and I became involved in the suit

7

in 1981 and we have probably had a total of 15 days of

8

hearing.

9

QUESTION;

And during those hearings have you

20

-- have they been spent receiving evidence or has a lot

2

of the time been devoted to negotiation and argument?

22

MR. TOWNSEND;

The last two weeks -- the
♦

23

two-week period in last March was receiving evidence,

24

and the evidence was that — presented -- Texas

25

presented the double mass analysis as the accounting

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

procedure and then it submitted evidence as an

2

alterative a river routing procedure that it felt,

3

believed to be an accurate procedure that would

4

accurately depict that definition.

5

QUESTION;

You didn’t rest exclusively on your

6

double mass analysis, as I understood it.

7

alternative theory of how to figure out the numbers,

8

don’t you?

9
10
11
12
13

SR. TOWNSEND;

You had an

We had an alternative theory,

and that's the double mass.
QUESTION;

And that -- evidence pertaining to

that is in the record, but there’s no resolution
MR. TOWNSEND;

It’s in the record.

No

14

resolution.

15

issues in the report, but the Master has taken a

16

different tack.

17
18
19

We were anticipating a resolution of those

QUESTION;

Those hearings were pursuant to a

pre-trial order?
MR. TOWNSEND;

Those hearings were pursuant

20

not to the original pre-trial order.

21

were pursuant to an order that was-issued, I believe, in

22

December of

23

Those hearings

'81 and the hearings were in March of ’82.

QUESTION;

Mr. Townsend, the Compact itself,

24

in Article VI seems to indicate that unless and until a

25

more feasible method is devised and adopted by the

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 023-9300

1

Commission that the inflow-outflow method will be used

2

Would it be your position that if the Court were to

3

direct the Master to proceed, that notwithstanding that

4

clear provision of the Compact, that some other method

5

should be considered?

6

MR. TOWNSEND*

Your Honor, the double mass

7

analysis is an inflow-outflow method.

8

accounting procedure that can be used in —

9

QUESTION*

It is an

Yes, except it says the method as

10

described in the report of the engineering advisory

11

committee will be used.

12

MR. TOWNSEND*

All right.

In respect to that,

13

what is described in the engineering advisory report is

14

a statement that the inflow-outflow method involves the

15

determination of the correlation between the index of

16

the inflow and the outflow from the basin.

17

view of the Master and in view of the Texas, is the

18

inflow-outflow method described and defined in the

19

report of the engineer advisors.

20

That, in the

What also is contained in the report of the

21

engineer advisors is a river routing study that is what

22

we have been referring to throughout as the S.D.

109

*

23

river routing, which produced the Plate 2 standard of

24

measurement.

25

river routing to be incorrect, inconsistent and

In the 1979 report, the Master found that

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

contained omissions.

2

Therefore, ha held that river routing to be a

3

nullity and that is why he defined the 1947 condition in

4

the terms that this Court approved.

5

revert — the Compact specifically says that the 1947

6

condition is that situation described and defined in the

7

report of tha engineer advisors, just like the language

8

in Article VI.

9

So when you

So by the Master's early ruling, he has made

10

that phrase, as described and defined in reference to

11

the river routing, a nullity.

12

point and Texas contends that the controlling language

13

is "shall use the inflow-outflow method" and then we

14

look at page 149 of S.D.

15

statement is that the inflow-outflow method involves the

16

determination that the correlation between the upstream

17

18

basin.

19

There is a void at that

109, and that is where the

Texas contends that if the Court were to

20

remand it back to the Master to proceed, then he is left

21

with the choice as to any inflow-outflow method to

22

depict the 1947 condition and is not restricted to a

23

river routing.

*

24
25

Texas proposed the inflow-outflow method
because the Master repeatedly expressed his concerns

about the river routing.

many, he continually said, the river routing has too

many unmeasured values, too many judgment-dependent

techniques.

states and he was — expressed his desire that some

6

other method could be used.

7

The river routing has too

That has caused the problem between the

Texas proposed the double mass.

The double

8

mass eliminates the judgment-dependent techniques and

9

eliminates the unmeasured values.

And with that

10

understanding Texas proposed this as a solution and a

11

superior method to the laborious river routing.

12

The Pecos — in regard to the claim that

13

continuation of the suit would require this Court to

14

perform administrative functions, Texas replies that

15

this is not — this is a suit to enforce the Compact.

16

This is a suit to enforce Federal rights that are

17

created by the Compact, since it is the law of the

18

Union, and that it is completely a judicial function to

19

determine those rights, even though it may require

20

making those difficult decisions concerning the

21

engineering procedures.

22

Texas submits that this process is easier than

23

the difficult processes involved in an equitable

24

apportionment suit, because the Compact limits your

25

inquiry to a certain extent.

Admittedly, it's not

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 620-9300

QUESTION*

Did the Commission adopt the river

routing method ever?
NR. TOWNSEND*

5

The Compact, yes, Your Honor,

6

they did.

7

routing, and that was going to be the basis.

8

RBD — excuse me.

9

The Compact negotiators used the river

QUESTION*

That wasn't stated in the Compact.

MR. TOWNSEND*

10

And the

The Compact stated that the

11

1947 condition is that situation described and defined

12

in the report of the engineer advisors, and when you

13

look at the report of the engineer advisors there is a

14

river routing.
QUESTION:

15
16

And has the Commission proceeded

on, purported to proceed on that basis?
MR. TOWNSEND*

17

The Commission has not

18

proceeded very far, Your Honor, but they were attempting

19

to utilize the river routing in S.D. 109 from the

20

beginning of the Compact administration.
QUESTION*

21

Well, why is it consistent with the

22

Compact to adopt another method for determining the 1947

23

condition?

♦

24
25

MR. TOWNSEND*

Because the Compact requires

the use of an inflow-outflow method and there are more

20

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

inflow-outflow methods than the river routing.

2

QUESTION!

Although you say the legislative

3

history of the Compact indicates that the river routing

4

was anticipated to be the method to be employed.

5

MR. TOWNSEND:

That was the method at that

6

time, in 1949.

7

think is a method that has been used by engineers, but

8

the present-day superiority of it is due to the fact of

9

the advancement and statistical analysis and to

The double mass is an outgrowth — I

10

computers and to the present day we believe that the

11

Commission should not necessarily be saddled with an

12

antiquated approach when there is something else

13

available.

14

QUESTION:

May I ask, do you understand the

15

result of the first report in this Court's decision, the

16

last time the case was here, that entirely repudiated

17

the report of the Engineering Advisory Committee or just

18

said it shouldn't be controlling?

19

MR. TOWNSEND!

I agree with the Master, Your

20

Honor, that he has found the RBD to have been adopted by

21

the Commission solely for the purposes of finding facts

22

between 1950 and 1961 and then, I think,

23

used — adopted by the Commission for future purposes,

24

accounting purposes.

25

So Texas submits that RBD has been utilized

10

Very well, Mr. Townsend.

ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANT
MS. URAM:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

11

the Court, Justice Stevens, you asked whether all sides

12

agreed that the Master could make all the necessary

13

determinations, and Mr. Townsend answered yes, and

14

that's correct, except that the parties disagree on the

15

nature of the Court's review and the extent to which it

16

can take action on behalf of the Commission or action

17

that's delegated to the Commission.

18

The Court here is presented --

19

QUESTION:

But isn't it true that one of the

20

problems is getting an understanding of some of the

21

basic underlying facts — how much-water — how much of

22

the water was flowing in 1947 and so forth?

23

Commission is supposed to make some of those findings

24

and has been unable to do so.

25

And the

Is it not correct the Master could make those

MS. URAM;

Ho, Your Honor.

QUESTION i

I see.

NS. URAMs The Court in this case is presented

4

That is where we

disagree.

7

with two very different ways of dealing with disputes

from interstate compact agencies.

way, takes a standard administrative and statutory law

One way. New Mexico's

10

approach.

11

statutory agency and the Court's review is structured,

12

it is limited accordingly.

The compact is a law.

The commission is a

13

The other approach, Texas' approach, would

14

require the Court to get into the detail of disputes

15

between compact agencies and in instances rewrite

18

compacts, write rules and methods under compacts.

17

QUESTION;

I take it from your brief and what

18

you say that you say we have no more authority to do

19

what Texas suggests or the Master has, that he has no

20

more authority to go forward than we have to appoint a

21

tie-breaker.

22

MS. URAM;

That's correct — not to do the

23

things that Texas asked.

The Master can review the

24

decision that the Commission made.

25

particular decision that the Commission made that

There is a

brought the parties to the court and was the subject of

2

this dispute for the first eight years of the case.

3

QUESTION;

Well, then, how is this problem

4

going to be resolved?

5

Master has no authority, and we have no authority to

6

appoint a tie-breaker.

7

MS. URAMs

You say they can't agree.

The

There is something for the Court to

8

review to resolve the dispute.

9

what the problem was here, and the problem here is that

Justice Blackmun asked

10

the Commission made a decision.

11

adoption of the review of basic data, is not a finding

12

of fact.

13

administrative rule, a rulemaking by an administrative

14

agency.

15

That decision, the

And that decision is similar to an

It sets the standard to be applied to make

16

findings of fact and those findings of fact go to

17

whether New Mexico is delivering the correct amount of

18

water to Texas.

19

and New Mexico agree -- adopted this review of basic

20

data.

21

So the Commission unanimously — Texas

In 1974, over a decade after the Commission

22

had adopted it and begun drafting further documents

23

based on it, the State of Texas repudiated the review of

24

basic data and brought this law suit.

25

went on to determine -- to make various determinations

regarding the Commission's authority to adopt the review

New Mexico urges the Court to direct the

9

Master that his role is to review those four remaining

10

items as the Court reviews an administrative decision.
QUESTION;

12

Miss Uram, the Master found that

the review of basic data was developed only for the

3

period of 1950 to 1961 and so it does not answer the

4

questions for the future.

5

determination.

6

MS. UHAM;

I mean, that was the Master's

That's what the Master said, and

7

the first time he said it was in 1979 in his last

8

report, but at the time that he said it then he also he

9

had not yet reached the consequence of that decision or

20

that issue and indeed there had been no discussion of it

21

before 1979.

22

QUESTION;

The United States in its brief

23

also, if I remember correctly, indicated that we

24

certainly can't decide everything based on the review of

25

basic data, that maybe it's a guideline to be employed

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) «28-9300

1

but that it won't solve all the problems.

2

MS. URAM;

The review of basic lata may not

3

solve all the problems, but the Master’s understanding

4

or ruling that the review of basic data was not to be

5

applied in the future was wrong.

6

The Compact is set up so that there should

7

never be a time when there is not a method to be

8

applied.

9

It said that you’re supposed to use the method as to the

10

inflow-outflow method, as described in the report of the

11

Engineering Advisory Committee.

12

continue to be used until the Commission changes it.

13

The Commission has authority to change it.

14

It established a method in the first place.

That method should

So that method continues until the Commission

15

changes it.

16

Commission changes it again, and the Compact does not

17

envision adoption of a method to be applied only for a

18

limited period.

19

measure, a technique, and in fact, when you look at what

20

the Commission did here, the Commission did not say we

21

adopt the review of basic data to be used for findings

22

of fact for a 12-year period.

23

The next method continues until the

It is an ongoing administrative

They had worked a decade making the

24

corrections in the review of basic data so that the

25

routing method could work.

After they worked a decade,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

they said we adopt it for use in all actions and

2

findings, for all actions and findings of the

3

Commission.

4

their intention to use it that way.

5

And then they went on, clearly explaining

They told the Committees to go ahead and

6

prepare the next set of findings and prepare a draft

7

inflow-outflow manual, both based on the review of basic

8

data.

9

of basic lata was intended to be used only until 1962

So the Master erred when he said that the review

10

and certainly the first eight years of this litigation

11

indicate that everyone understood that the review of

12

basic data was still the subject of this suit.

13

It was — the entire pre-trial order is

14

written toward the early phases, the question whether

15

the Commission acted within its authority to adopt it,

18

and then whether certain technical portions are valid.

17

QUESTION»

Basically are you requesting that

18

the Master quantify the water as of 1947 and then

19

provide for annual distribution techniques?

20

MS. URAMi

No.

Texas is asking that the

21

Master come in and make those kinds of determinations.

22

The determinations of how you translate the 1947

23

condition, what standard or method you use, are

24

contained in the review of basic data.

context, which is the one New Mexico urges as the

2

appropriate one here, is to review the method and say

3

whether it is valid within the statute — a standard,

traditional type of judicial function.

5

Instead --

6

QUESTION:

Well, Miss Uram, what is the

7

authority for your position that the Master and,

8

ultimately, this Court can sit as a reviewing court to

9

review the findings of the Compact agency?

Ordinarily,

10

those sort of things are set out in the statute, that

11

the agency does certain things and then a court does

12

certain other things, and here you're just kind of

13

superimposing this Court on the agency without any

14

statutory structure.
MS. URAM:

15
16

You're correct. Your Honor.

Ordinarily -QUESTION:

17

Doesn't the Compact itself say that

18

the determinations of the Commission are reviewable in

19

the Court?
MS. URAM:

20
21

Yes.

It says findings of fact are

reviewable in court.

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. URAM:

Does it say in what court?
*
No.
It say s in courts or in

QUESTION;

Well# this would be the first

2

agency, I think, that had its findings directly

3

reviewable in the Supreme Court.

4

KS . URAMi

That's probably true, Your Honor.

5

But the — this Compact, you will recall, was signed in

6

1948 and the Administrative Procedure Act was signed

7

only two years — was enacted only two years before.

8

modern compacts one will see a good deal of the type of

9

language one sees in the Administrative Procedure Act,

10

with specifications as to period for review and so forth.

11
12

In

But certainly in an early compact like this,
the language will be somewhat different.

But the basic

3

framework is the same.

The — since World War II

4

particularly we have been seeing an increase in the

5

growth of compacts and these compacts have had

6

interstate agencies charged with positive powers.

7

compacts have not simply been an adjustment of a

8

one-time dispute.

Those

9

They have positive inter-governmental powers,

20

and the question is how is the Court going to deal with

2

disputes from these agencies.

22

QUESTION;

Do these more recent compacts that

23

you refer to which specify agency authority and court

24

review specify the court in which the review shall take

25

place?

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MS. URAM:

In some instances/ they do.

For

2

example, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit

3

Authority Compact/ the one that governs transportation

4

here in the District of Columbia, specifies that review

5

from certain types of things shall go to one type of

6

court and review from other types of things will go to

7

another type of court.
QUESTION

Neither specify this Court, I take

MS. URAM;

I don't recall that they do.

But what we have here is we have a situation

it.

12

where undoubtedly there will be disputes between states

13

on how these — on decisions that these agencies make,

14

and if those disputes are brought to this Court, the

15

question is how should the Court deal with this.

16

the Court be called upon to jump in and make all the

17

findings that are delegated by the compacts to

18

commissions?

19

Should

Is that the correct role of the Court?

Or is it, rather, to take that great body of

administrative law which has been developed in the last

40 or 50 years and use the principles there to --

QUESTION;

What standard of review?

What

standard of review by the Court?
MS. URAX;

Well, the standard — I would think

the appropriate standard would be the one that the Court

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

used to apply before it bad statutes such as the

2

Administrative Procedure Act.

whether the action is constitutional, whether it

complies with the statute, whether it was done properly

under the procedures in the statute, and whether it was

The Court would look to

So there are — there are standards to look

to.

10

They are basically in the Compact, and we urge the

these responsibilities themselves.

11

QUESTION*

But isn't it true that all the

12

examples you give are situations in which there is a

13

neutral factfinder or a neutral administrative law judge

14

of some kind to start with?

15

in which there are two parties, either of which can veto

16

the findings, and if you have a situation in which one

17

decides to be obstinant -- and

18

has — and just doesn't agree to anything, you simply

19

can't apply the principles you describe.
HS. URAHs

20

Here you have a situation

I'm not suggesting either

Well, we have here a special

21

situation.

That's correct, Your Honor.

But we have a

decision to be reviewed and there doesn't seem to be any

reason --

24

It seems to me one of the initial

problems is you have a lot of decisions that haven't

MS. URAM:

Oh, well, you see, Your Honor, the

situation is really a little simpler than it looks.

There is a lot of ietail in the case and it does give

one the impression that the situation's more complicated

than it appears to be.
QUESTIONS

7
8

You identified four specific

controversies that remain unresolved.

9

MS. URAMs

Yes.

10

QUESTIONS

Now is it possible that the Master

11

could, if he felt himself qualified to do so, could have

12

decided each of those four issues?

13

MS. URAMs

Yes.

The Master --

14

QUESTION:

Well, why do we have to worry about

understand that, but apparently he hasn’t decided any of

MS. URAM;

We agree on the same four issues.

The place where we part is that Texas says the Master

can substitute another method, one that’s never been

brought before the Commission, for the method that the

9

Commission decided on.

QUESTION:

But they also have an alternative

know if these four issues remain, because Texas in open

court before the Master said that if she had a hearing

11

on the double mass method she would waive any remaining

12

issues on the review of basic data.

13

So if this case goes back to the Master and

14

takes an administrative law rather than an open-ended

Part of the problem is the issue of unanimity,

correctly pointed out, that's a common requirement in

they require unanimity is to set up a way that the

So what compacts try to do when

Now Texas has said that there's no enforcement

mechanism here.

anticipated that when the states came to a finding the

17

upstream state. New Mexico, if it was not delivering

18

sufficient water, would then proceed voluntarily,

19

without any court enforcement, to go and make the

20

necessary decisions under the Compact to shut certain

21

users down.

The legislative history in Senate

22

The unanimity requirement is tied with other

23

measures to push the states to come to such agreement,

24

and the measures here are the binding nature of the

25

compact and the difficulty of getting out of it.

QUESTION;

enforcement mechanism and, as you say, the procedures

9

are voluntary, then a party who feels that the compact

10

isn't giving that state the fair share that the

11

agreement provided for may feel very strongly something

12

should be done but the party which feels that it’s

13

really getting the lion’s share, which I suspect may

more often than not be the upstream state, may be

perfectly content with a rather ineffectual compact

organization.

specific situation, and I disagree with the

characterization, Your Honor, that it is ineffectual.

think it’s set up to function in a different way than

modern statutes because of the interstate nature of the

disputes.

situation, is New Mexico, as an upstream state, in an

25

position where she should be happy with the Compact.
