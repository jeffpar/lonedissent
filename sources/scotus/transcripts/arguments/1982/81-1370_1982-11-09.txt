ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

KB . DAVIS :

10

if the Court please :

11

Power and

Think l' :>U , "r · ::hief Justice , and

rhe central issue in this case is whether or

12

not a Kansas statute k nown by its framers as the Kansas

13

Na tu ra l C! s Price Protection Act , is in violation of the

1' contract clause of the United States Constitution .
15

There is no ar9ument in this case t hat this

18

particula r Kansas statute does impair t wo natural 9as

17

purchase and sales contracts bet ween Ener9 y Reserves and

18

Kansas Power and Liqht C:>apany .

19

question that this impairment occurs from five to six

20

Ye!rs , and not only does it incur -- not only does it

21

prevent £ner9y Reser v es from receivin9 a substan tial

22

portion of the consideration that they would have

23

contract .
Kansas Po v er and Li•ht Company's ansver to

3

this impairment is that it violates -- that it is vithin

4

the reserve police power of the State of

5

Underk the decisions of this Court in Home

8

Buildinq anj

Association v. Blaisdell , United

7

States Trust v . the State of Nev Jersey, Allied

8

Structural Steel v . Spannaus, this Court set forth

9

certain tests of reasonableness, and also that the

10

statute •ust be of a character justifyin9 the use of the

11

police power .

12

The points that I vant to make are four, and

13

thse are that in the first place, these contracts vould

14

not have been entered into without these pricinQ

16

provisions that have been impaired .

18
17
18

Seconjarily, I want to point out that the
i•pair•ent to ERG , Enerqy Reserves, is severe .
Thirdly, I'd like to point out that this

19 statute has an extremely narro w focus , is very limited
20
21

in its application.
And the fourth point that I want to make is

22

that this statute serves no broad societal benefit, and

23

in fact, does not solve any emerqency or any supposed

24

e•eroency that it is supposed to solve .

25

The facts in thi s c ase 3re that in September

of 1975, after months of negotiations, the parties
2

finally agreed to the terms of these two contracts that

3

are invol v ed .

•

These are what you call long term natural

contr1=ts .

One is for the life of the gas field and

5

the other is for the life of a gas processing plant .

6

They have 1 dur1tion of 20 to 30 years .
fhe t wo pricing provisions that are involved ,

7
6

t he first one is one that says that in the event tha t

9

there is a price ?rescribed for the g1s involved that is

10

higher t hao the pr ice that is being paid under this

11

contract by any governmental 1uthority , then that ne w

12

price as prescribed by government would be the ne w price

13

under the contract .

1•

The sacond pricing provision th1t's involve d

15

here is what is known as a pricing redetermination

16

pi::ovi sion.

17

every t wo years , Energy Reserves is entitled to come to

16

KPC.L and say that we want our price redetermined.

19

want it rejetermined on the bl.sis of what is being paid

20

for other gas in the State of Kansas under like

21

con tracts .
