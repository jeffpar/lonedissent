ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 81-298

8

MR. CZARRA*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court, this statutory construction case
10 involves television programs for the deaf.
11

Some

background will establish the context for the specific

12 facts and the narrow legal issue that is before the
13 Court.
14

Without visual aids, most deaf parsons cannot

15 understand the sound

part of television.

Government

16 agencies and broadcasters have been working for more
17 than a decade on ways to provide the leaf with suitable
18 access to the sound
19

part of television.

1980, there were essentially two kinds of special visual

20 aids that could help the deaf.

22

Until early

One was sign language

The other was so-called open captions.

While helpful to the deaf, both are visible on

23 all television sets.

Because they are distracting and

24 block part of the visual picture, both impact adversely
25 on television service for the non-deaf majority.

This is so-called,

One system reached the marketplace

The other is not as far along, but it may

Basically, both involve transmission of

7

mechanisms.
Producing captions that fit the visual action

public television's historic budget crunch has grown

18

much worse lately.

Some programs are not suited to captions at

Despite these difficult problems, great

20 strides have been made.
21

It is far more complex than

Due to a combination of

available approaches, deaf viewers throughout the

22 country today have access to the sound part of many
23

hours of television each week on both commercial and

24

public stations.

25

Now, this case comes to the Court on a record

that covers KCET’s 1974 to 1977 license term.

This was

2 long before closed captioning was in being.
3

Nevertheless, KCET had presented nearly 1,000 programs

4

with special visual aids during that license term.

5

Respondents requested the FCC to deny KCET’s license

6 renewal.
7

The

They claimed that KCET’s programs for the deaf

were not enough, and had not been presented in peak

8 viewing hours.
9

Respondents focused on the comparatively new

10

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that

11

prohibits discrimination against handicapped persons by

12

recipients of federal financial assistance.

13

requested the FCC to use its license renewal processes

14

to force KCET to provide more of the special services

15

they believe that Section 504 required.

16

Respondents

Three points made by the FCC in denying

17

Respondents* complaint merit emphasis here.

18

FCC found that KCET had offered special broadcasts for

19

the deaf, and had not abused its discretion in

20 scheduling them.
21

22

First, the

The only specific claims of KCET

shortcomings were thus found baseless.
Second, the FCC reviewed the many steps it had

23

taken under the general public interest standard of the

24

Communications Act concerning television for the deaf,

25

and some of these predated enactment of Section 504.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Third, the FCC concluded that it lacked

1

2 Section

504 enforcement iuties, because it did not

3

dispense public funds.

The FCC deferred to the funding

4

agencies to decide complaints of Section 504 violations,

5

but the FCC made very clear that any finding of a

6 Section 504 violation by KCET would be given weight.
7

Meanwhile, the Respondents went elsewhere.

8 They filed a complaint against KCET at what is now the
9

Department of Education, one of the funding agencies.

10

They also brought a class action against KCET in

11

District Court.

12

discrimination, and both were eventually resolved in

13

KCET’s favor.

14

Both complaints charged Section 504

The Respondents then appealed the FCC's denial

15

of their complaint.

A panel of the D.C. Circuit,

16

speaking through Judge Wright, with Judge McGowan

17

dissenting, reversed the FCC.

18

extensive record evidence of KCET’s service to the deaf,

19

as well as the FCC’s conclusions about it.

Its decision ignored the

We ask this

20 Court to reverse the D.C. Circuit.
21

The sole basis for the D.C. Circuit’s decision

22 was its belief that Section 504 expressed such a strong
23

national policy in favor of the deaf that the FCC had to

24

read the public interest standard in the Communications

25

Act as if it incorporated the policy of Section 504.

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 The FCC thus was ordered independently to decide KCET's
2 Section 504 compliance as part of the license renewal
3 proceedings at the FCC.
4

The narrow issue this Court agreed to review

5 is whether that novel incorporation theory is a legally
6 correct interpretation of the intent of Congress.

We

7 say it is not.
8

The mandatory incorporation theory is at war

g with this Court's holding that the FCC has very broad
10 discretion to decide the scope of the public interest

11 standard.

We have found no holding by this Court

12 suggesting that the FCC must automatically read into the
13 public interest standard policies expressed by the
14 Congress in other statutes.
15

The FCC is not required to incorporate the

16 policy of another law unless the Congress directs it.
17 Of course, the FCC may and often does consider the
18 policies of other statutes when it determines the scope
19 of the public interest standard in the Comm unications
20 Act, but that is an initial judgment that the Congress
21 entrusted to the FCC.
22

The FCC exhibited leadership concerning

23 television for the deaf.

The Court of Appeals acted as

24 if the FCC had done nothing.
25

QUESTION*

Mr. Czarra, do you have any idea

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

whether the FCC at the license renewal stage would take

2 into consideration the fact, if there were a fact, that
3

a licensee had been found to be guilty of an unfair

4

labor practice?
HR. CZARRA;

5

Yes, it would.

The FCC takes

6 into account findings by other agencies or courts of
7 violations of law by its licensees.

QUESTION:

8
9

What would it do if it found that a

licensee had committed an unfair labor practice?
HR. CZARRAi

10

It would depend on the

11

circumstances.

I don’t recall immediately a case about

12

an unfair labor practice, but they would look to see to

13

what extent that judicial or other agency finding

14

indicated a character trait on the part of the licensee

15

that suggested it undeserving to be licensed.
QUESTION:

16

What if an intervenor in a license

17

renewal proceeding, if that is what you call them,

18

someone objecting to the license renewal, said, I think

19

this station has been guilty of an unfair labor

20 practice.
21

22

It is true, the NLRB has never passed on it.

Would the FCC undertake to determine that for itself?
HR. CZARRA:

Well, I think the FCC initially

23

would look at the nature of the allegations, how well

24

they were supported by specific facts, affidavits, and

25

so on, but I suspect that the most that the FCC would do

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

in that situation is simply wait to see what one of the

2 enforcement agencies would do.

QUESTION;

3

Do you think if — assume the

4 unfair labor practice had been adjudicated by the NLRB,
5 or that it hadn't, but the intervenor called the FCC's
6 attention to an adjudicated unfair labor and an alleged

7 unadjudicated one.

Could the FCC say, sorry, that is

8 irrelevant?

SR. CZARRA; I don't think that they would say

9

10 that it was irrelavant.

QUESTION;

11

12 it legally?

I didn't ask that.

Could they say

Must they -- must they take into account

13 this failure of a licensee to live up to the
14 requirements of another law?

Must they take that into

15 account?
16

MR. CZARRA;

No, I think it depends on the

17 nature of the law.
18

QUESTION;

What about this case, then?

Didn't

19 the FCC say that the licensee's conduct under Section
20 504
21

is irrelevant?
MR. CZARRA;

No, they did not.

They said that

22 they were going to wait until --

23

QUESTION;

Irrelevant to the license renewal

24 proceedings.
25

MR. CZARRA;

No, they said it was relevant,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and that they would take into account any adjudication

2 by a responsible agency that there had been

3 discrimination or violation of Section 504.
4

QUESTION

But until some other agency acted

5 on it, it was irrelevant?
6

MR. CZARRA;

Well, I am stumbling over the

7 word "irrelevant."
8

QUESTION;

Well, anyway, they would not take

9 evidence as to what the station's conduct was with
10 respect to 504 -11

MR. CZARRA:

12

QUESTION;

Well, they had —
-- as long as there had been no

13 adjudication by some other agency.
14

MR. CZARRA;

But they had evidence before it

15 of what the station was doing in terms of service to the
16 deaf, and it decided that apart from a specific finding
17 by a funding agency that there was some problem under
18 504, that the Commission under its view of the public
19 interest standard found no shortcoming.

It noted

20 specifically in its opinion that the station had been
21

providing programs for the deaf.

It noted specifically

22 that there was a controversy over the scheduling of

23 those programs, but consistent with its historic views
24 on scheduling questions, said, no problem, as far as the
25 public interest standard is concerned.

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

For eight or nine years before the Commission

1

2 acted on the Respondent's complaints here, and beginning
3

well before enactment of Section 504, the FCC had been

4 focusing on
5

the question of television for the deaf.

It

did not advocate its responsibilities in proceeding as

6 it did, for it balanced the conflicting interests of the
7 deaf and the hearing audiences.

It studied the evolving

8 technology.

As far as the published opinions

Justice O'Connor, there is no indication that they

into account a statute called Section

17 504 .

QUESTION;

18

It never mentioned it by number or

19 name?

20
21

MR. CZARRA:

Not as far as I recall, but after

its enactment it did on several occasions before it

22 resolved this case deal with the subject of television
23 service for

the deaf.

24 this new captioning
25 progressed,

It was authorizing experiments on

technology.

After those had

it actually authorized regular operations

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

with the new technology, and it was continuing to

2 observe the problem, study the question, and it
3 continued,

though, to pronounce its decision that it did

4 not feel that under all of the circumstances things were
5 far enough along to warrant a mandatory obligation by
6 television stations to do any particular thing for the
7 deaf, though it encouraged them to do what they could.
QUESTIONS

8

If we were to determine that the

9 Act, Section 504, is relevant to the purposes and things
10 which
11

the FCC has to decide in some way, I take it it is

your position that the FCC has taken action and has

12 applied the principles embodied in 504.
MR. CZARRAs

13

Precisely.

I think that the FCC

14 was out in front of the Congress and in front of the
15 national policy in terms of television for the deaf, for
16 it started to deal with this question in 1970, three
17 years before there was such a thing as the
18 Rehabilitation Act.
Did the holding of the Court of

22 indicating its consideration of the section

23
24 Appeals*

MR. CZARRAi

Well, I think the Co urt of

opinion is somewhat ambiguo us.

On the one

25 hand, there is language that says, n o w , we are leaving

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

this up to you, FCC.

2 this requirement.

You fill in the interstices of

But by the same token, there was

3 language in the opinion

that says, we expect you to do

4 something about this now.
5

We expect stations to do

this, and in the light of the record where KCET had

6 shown that it had done extensive things, one can only
7 wonder if the Court of Appeals wasn't saying that we are
8 requiring you,

FCC, to order these stations to take some

9 kinds of affirmative action that they have not taken up
10 until now.

QUESTION;

11

What if evidence is offered that

12 out of the 300 employees, there are only 3 percent that
13 include minorities, Hispanics, orientals, Negroes,
14 cetera?

et

Is that relevant to the issue before the

15 Commission on the renewal of the license?
16

MR. CZARRA;

17 into all sorts

Yes, it would be.

The FCC looks

of things, but employment of women and

18 minorities is one of the things they look at.
19

QUESTION*

Why wouldn't the Commission then

20 have a hearing on the allegations that a station hadn't
21

22

lived up to its obligations under 504?
MR. CZARRA*

Well, the FCC had said in 1970

23 and again in 1976 that we are not going

to impose any

24 specific obligations because this whole question of
25 television service for the deaf is wrapped up in

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

technology and economics and other practical problems

2 Therefore/

we are not going to mandate some specific

3

actions.

So that pleadings saying that a station had

4

only done X amount of programming for the deaf would not

5

run afoul of any stated policy, any standard, any

6 guideline that the FCC had laid down.

QUESTION;

7

But allegedly had run afoul of

8 504 .
9
10

MR. CZARRAj
QUESTIONi

Well, that is correct, but -Just like the Commission listens to

11

allegations that the station hasn't lived up to some of

12

its obligations under some other statutes.

13

MR. CZARRAi

Well, the Commission evaluates

14

the factual allegations and the record of the station,

15

and it decides whether in its view of the public

16

interest, whether it takes into account fully the

17

provision of some other statute or only partially.

18
19

QUESTION;

Well, did the Commission in this

case, or did it not, rule that the Section 504 provided

20 no basis for the non-renewal of the license?
21

MR. CZARRA ;

It did not so state that .

It

22 said that it was not the enforcement agency for 504,
23

that until an enforcement agency had ruled KCET to h

24

discriminated, there was nothing for it to evaluate,

25

bearing in mind again that it was satisfied that the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL A. ALITO, JR., ESQ.,

7
8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN NO. 81-799

9

MR. ALITO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court, the narrow issue presented by this
11

case is which agency or agencies have the responsibility

12 for construing and enforcing Section 504 of
13 Rehabilitation Act.
14 proceedings,

the

Must the FCC do so in licensing

as the Court of Appeals held, or is the

15 responsibility

for interpreting and enforcing Section

16 504 exclusively that of the funding agencies,

as we

17 believe Congress determined?

QUESTION:

18

You think, it must be one or the

19 other?

MR. ALITO:

20
21

No, it could be both, Your Honor.

Our position is that Congress intended for Section 504

22 to be enforced by the funding agencies exclusively, and
23 not by agencies like the FCC, that do not provide -24

QUESTION:

5o it couldn't be both under the

25 statute?

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. ALITO;

1

That's correct.

We believe that

2 Congress's intent was that it be enforced --

QUESTION;

3

So the FCC would have no authority

4 by rule to say that because of 504 the stations must do
5 so and so?

MR. ALITO;

6

I believe the FCC certainly has

7 the authority under its own public interest standard to
8 impose captioning requirements, and it has said so.

QUESTION;

9

Yes, but when it says particularly

10 because of 504, the requirements of 504, we are
11

incorporating into our public interest standard, it

12 would have authority to do that?

MR. ALITO;

13

I believe that the enactment of

14 504 or any other statute is something that the
15 Commission could take into consideration in making its
16 public interest determination,

but I don't believe the

17 Commission can take upon itself the responsibility for
18 enforcing statutes if that responsibility was committed
19 to other agencies by Congress, and I think —

QUESTION;

20
21

Then you don't agree with your

colleague, who suggested that the employment policies of

22 the licensee are relevant factors in the license
23 renewal.
24

MR. ALITO;

25 relevant factor.

Oh, I agree that that is a

Your Honor.

QUESTION*

2

MR. ALITO*

3

QUESTION:

How does it affect the listeners?
Pardon ne?
How does the employment practice of

4

technicians, stenographers, salesmen, at cetera, have

5

any bearing on what goes out over the air?
MR. ALITO*

6
7

The Commission has taken the

position that a station that refuses to employ persons

8 regardless of race, sax, national origin, or religion,
9
10

cannot provide service to all members of the community,
as is required by the Communications Act.
QUESTION:

11

It is —

Well, then I am confused by your

12

other response that these -- I thought you were

13

indicating that the enforcement of these other statutory

14

duties entrusted to other agencies was left to them, and

15

not to be taken on by the FCC.

16

MR. ALITO*

I think it's necessary to draw a

17

sharp distinction between the enforcement of other

18

statutes or the policies they express merely because

19

those policies happen to be expressed in the statute and

20 a factor that the Commission determines to be relevant
21

under the public interest standard.
QUESTION*

22

What could be a greater enforcement

23

mechanism than the threat of losing a television

24

license?

25

MR. ALITO*

It certainly is severe.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

That is far more serious than an

is it not?
MR. ALITO:

5

sanction.

It certainly is a severe

The question is whether it is the sanction

6 Congress intended in this instance,
7

and our position is,

Congress intended for Section 504 to be enforced by the

8 funding agencies.

The very structure of Section 504

9 points clearly in that .direction.

504 is not applicable

10

to all private entities or all that could be reached

11

under the commerce clause.

12

recipients of federal financial assistance.

13

merely attached certain conditions to the receipt of

14

federal aid, and if one of those conditions is violated,

15

then the most obvious and basic remedies are to cut off

16

the funding or to enjoin the recipient from continued

17

violation of the terms of the grant.

It applies only to

Now, the FCC and other licensing agencies,
unlike the funding agencies and unlike the courts, lack

20 the power to do either of those things.
21

Congress

So, as I said,

the structure of Section 504 makes it ill suited for

22 enforcement by agencies like the Federal Communications
23

Commission.

Beyond that, we believe that the

24

legislative history of Section 504 clearly illustrates

25

that Congress intended for that provision to be enforced

18

1

by the funding agencies

There is nothing in Section

2 504 itself and nothing in the legislative history of
3 that provision to indicate

that Congress contemplated

4 enforcement by agencies like the FCC.

And in our view, that is highly significant,

5

6 for when Congress establishes a comprehensive
7 administrative

procedure for the enforcement of the

8 statute, and commits that responsibility to a particular
9 agency or agencies,

and it says nothing about

10 enforcement by other agencies,
11

then we believe it may be

fairly inferred that Congress intended -- did not intend

12 for those agencies to have the enforcement
13 responsibility.

QUESTION;

MR. ALITO;

Was that an erroneous decision?
Absolutely not.

Employment

4 discrimination is different from captioning, for a
5 number of reasons.

First of all, probably the most

6 important reason is that captioning,

is a problem of
The technology is in

There ace competing technologies at this time,

and it is the Commission's judgment in the exercise of

12 its discretion in bringing its expertise to bear on this

13 problem that at the present time under its public
14 interest standard technological progress may best be
15 stimulated by refraining from imposing compulsory
16 constraints, but the Commission has made it clear that
17 it will continue to monitor developments in this area,
18 and will not hesitate to impose mandatory requirements
19 if sufficient progress is not demonstrated by the
20 broadcasters, if the remaining technical and financial
21

questions are not resolved, and perhaps after Section

22 504*s meaning is clarified by the funding agencies.

23

Let me address a bit more directly this

24 question of employment discrimination, because it is
25 central to Respondent's argument and also to the

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

reasoning of the Court of Appeals.
I think it is important to recognize that the

2

3 Commission's treatment of employment iiscrimination and
4 its treatment of the problem of captioning and making
5 television understandable for the deaf is parallel in
6 many respects.

The Commission does not enforce Title

7 VII of the Civil Rights Act of
8 employment discrimination.

1964, which deals with

The Commission does not

9 enforce Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

11

has stated that under its public interest

standard, it will take into account employment

12 discrimination

13

The

by licensees.

Similarly, under its public interest standard,

14 the Commission has long sought technically and
15 financially feasible means of making television
16 accessible to hearing impaired viewers, but it has
17 reached the judgment that imposing mandatory captioning
18 requirements at the present time under the public
19 interest standard is not wise.
20
21

The second point to remember is that the FCC
voluntarily and in the exercise of its discretion

22 decided to take on the responsibility for looking at

23 employment discrimination by licensees.
24 compelled to do that by any court.

It was not

And therefore, what

25 the Commission has done voluntarily in that area is

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

hardly precedent for what the Court of Appeals did in

2 this case.
3

And the third point which I —

4

QUESTION;

5

Your thought there is that the

Commission may take into consideration some policies

6 from other statutes as a part of the public interest
7 standard o n its own initiative, although had it declined
8 to do so, the Court of Appeals couldn’t compel it to do
9
10

so.
SR. ALITO;

The Commission's decision to

11

consider or not to consider a factor would be tested

12

against an abuse of discretion standard.

13

QUESTION;

Hell, do you think that in the

14

particular case that we are talking about, it is the

15

Commission’s position that it couldn't have been

16

required to consider employment discrimination if it had

17

chosen not to, if that had been appealed to the Court of

18

Appeals the way the 504 situation was here?

19

MR. ALITO;

The Commission might well have

20 been held by a court to have abused its discretion if it
21

had decided that no evidence of employment

22 discrimination, no matter how invidious, was relevant to
23

the public interest standard, and the same sort of test

24

is the proper one here.

25

broad discretion when it decided to treat the question

Did the Commission abuse its

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of captioning as it did?

The Commission has thoroughly

2 considered this problem, and has developed a
3 comprehensive approach

to the problem, and its approach

4 has three basic parts.

It requires the transmission of emergency

5

6 announcements in visual form.
7 the

present time under the public interest standard

8 other mandatory requirements should not be imposed.

It

adjudicate violations of

504 itself, but will take into account as

evidence of a licensee’s character any violations found

12 by one of the appropriate funding agencies.

The test that the Court of Appeals ought to

13

14 have applied is,
15 discretion,

and if the court had applied that test, we

16 feel confiient

it would have been required to sustain

17 the Commission’s

approach.

QUESTION;

Your argument, counsel, seems to go

The station says the

and it has made an appropriate response at the present

22 time, and you are saying that there was no obligation at
23 all

on the part of FCC to even recognize those

24 policies.
25 that far in

That seems to me perhaps not necessary to go
this case.

Would you agree with that?

MR. ALITO:

1

Your Honor, I hope that that is

2 not the argument that I have left the impression I am
3

advancing.

My argument is that the Commission was not

4

reguired to define and enforce Section 504.

5

Commission may have been required under the public

The

6 interest standard to consider the problem of service to
7

the deaf.

The Commission has considered that problem

8 beginning before the enactment of the Rehabilitation

9 Act, and it has not abused its discretion in the manner
10 in which it considered

QUESTION:

11

the problem.

Hell, it did here just reject the

12 submission without hearing.

MR. ALITO:

It rejected the submission here

That's correct, Your Honor.

It

that it would take into account any violations

20 subsequently found by the appropriate funding agencies.
21

QUESTION:

But apparently it did think that

22 the station wasn’t out of line in terms of what the
23 Commission's own judgment had been in the past about
24
25

what stations ought to do.
MR. ALITO:

The Commission has taken the

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

position that mandatory requirements should not be

2 imposed, largely for the technical reasons that I have

3 touched on, and therefore there was no reason to conduct
4 a hearing to determine whether the number of captioned
5 hours broadcast by KCET was sufficient to meet any
6 standard previously imposed.

QUESTION*

7

So the Commission's policy was, the

8 station should not be made to do anything with respect

9 to 504.
HR. ALITO:

That is correct, Your Honor, in a

sen se.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN NO.

MR. ALITO:

7

You may continue, Mr.

81-799 - RESUMED

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, in FCC versus National Citizens

8 Commission for Broadcasting, this Court stated, "While
9

the Commission does not have the power to enforce the

10 antitrust laws as such,
11

it is permitted to take

antitrust policies into account in making licensing

12 decisions pursuant to the public interest standard."

Paraphrasing that statement and applying it to

13
14

this case, while the Commission does not have the power

15

to enforce Section 504 as such, it is permitted to take

MR. ALITO:

24

The Court didn't find that it had

to.

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

QUESTION;

1

What is your submission on that?

2 Must it, or not?

MR. ALITO:

3

It varies/ I think. Your Honor/

4 depending from case to case.

I don’t believe it’s

5 possible to make a blanket statement.
QUESTION:

6

What about -- Let's just take the

7 antitrust case then, if you want to do it case by case.
8 Must it take antitrust considerations into account?

MR. ALITO;

9

In certain contexts,

I think it

10 may be required to do so, but not —

QUESTION:

Sometimes it must?

QUESTION;

In the context of the antitrust

13 laws?
14

MR. ALITC:

15

QUESTION;

16

MR. ALITO;

In certain -Sometimes it must?
In certain contexts,

17 anticompetitive behavior by a licensee might be relevant
18 to the licensing decision.
19

QUESTION:

20

MR. ALITO;

21

22

So it must in certain cases.
Under an abuse of discretion

standard, it might be found to be required to do so.
QUESTION:

So in our case, it must take into

23 consideration in the proper case, as you say, the
24 conduct of the licensee in the light of 504.
25

MR. ALITO:

I don't mean -- by proper case, I

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

don’t mean the case of one licensee as opposed to

2 another licensee.
3

I mean with respect to a particular

problem and a particular policy.

Here, the point is

4 that the Commission has adopted a considered policy with
5 respect to this problem of

technological flux and

6 technological complexity.

QUESTION:

7
8

Hr. Alito, may I ask. you a question

about the particular problem that this case raises?

9 I understand it,

As

this is a license renewal proceeding,

10

and Mrs. Gottfried objected to the renewal of the

11

license, and filed an objection to the renewal which was

12 later supported by

13 right?

some kind of an affidavit.

And what I want to know is, where is the

14 affidavit in the papers?
15 on

Is that

What is it that she has filed

which she did not get a hearing?

I can’t find it in

16 the papers.
17

MR. ALITO:

Her claim was, she had two basic

18 claims.
19

QUESTION:

My specific question first is,

20 where can I find it in the

papers?

Do you know?

21

QUESTION:

Her claim, or her submission.

22

QUESTION:

Her submission that —

23

MR. ALITO:

It is in the record of the case.

24 It is not in the joint appendix.
25

QUESTION:

It is not in the appendix at all?

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

MR. ALITO

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. ALITO;

4 claims.

No, it’s not
Oh.

Then, what was her claim?

I believe she had two principal

The first was a general allegation that the

5 programming of this licensee and the other Los Angeles
6 television stations involved was insufficient with

7 respect to the deaf.
QUESTION:

8

The second was that the —
Insufficient according to what

9 standard?
10
11

MR. ALITO:

Under the — Under Section 504 of

the Rehabilitation Act.

Her second claim was that KCET

12 had abused its discretion by its decision concerning the

13 scheduling of the ABC captioned news, and as to that
14 question, the Commission inquired into the matter and
15 found that KCET had not abused its programming
16 discretion.
17

QUESTION:

So she did get a hearing on the

18 second charge she made?
19

MR. ALITO:

She certainly got an inquiry by

20 the Commission into that charge.
21

She did not get an

inquiry into the general allegation of insufficient

22 programming for the deaf, because the Commission does

23 not have at this time mandatory requirements concerning
24 captioning.
25

What is basically wrong with the Court of

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Appeals decision in this case is that it requires the

2 Commission to pave the way in construing what Section

3 504 requires.

It requires something more than simply a

4 recitation of the language of Section 504, because 504’s
5 requirements in the area of captioning are as yet not
6 fully defined.

For example, it may be argued under this

7 Court’s decision in Southeastern Community College
8 versus Davis that Section 504 requires no captioning

9 because Section 504 doejs not demand expensive
10 affirmative efforts to overcome handicaps,
11
12

the

disabilities imposed by handicap.
On the other hand, it may be argued again

13 based on Davis that captioning is required because there
14 are instances in which the refusal to accommodate the
15 needs of the handicapped through captioning or some
16 other available technology might amount to
17 discrimination.

Until such basic questions concerning

18 Section 504’s applicability to the problem of captioning
19 are resolved, and in our view they should be resolved by
20 the funding
21

agencies, it will be impossible for the

Commission to determine in a licensing proceeding

22 whether a licensee had complied with Section 504 —

23

2'JESTIDMs

May I ask. another question?

24 Because I have a lot of difficulty with abstract
25 problems, as this seems to be.

Did she in her paper

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

allege specific facts that she said constituted a

2 violation of a statute?

NR. ALITO;

3

She alleged facts which she

4 claimed constituted a violation.
QUESTION;

5
6 allege?

Basically,
NR. ALITO;

7

Essentially, what facts did she
what did she say?
The specific allegation concerned

8 when KCET began to broadcast the ABC captioned news, and

9 the hour at which it was programmed.

The general

10 allegations concerned the number of programs broadcast
11

during the license term that were accessible to hearing

12 impaired viewers.

QUESTION;

13

Ani so, could it be said that by

14 denying a hearing, that the FCC said — ruled, in
15 effect, that those allegations, even if true, do not
16 constitute a violation of that statute, or is it better
17 to say they don't care whether it constitutes a
18 violation of the statute?
NR. ALITO;

19
20 either.
21

Which is their view?

Your Honor, I don't believe it's

They did not find that those did not constitute

a violation of 504.

They certainly did not say that

22 whether or not KCET had violated 504 was irrelevant.

It

23 was relevant to the character, to KCET's character and
24 therefore its fitness for a license, but the Commission
25 stated that it would wait until a violation of that

statute was found by one of the funding agencies
QUESTION:

That’s like saying they don't care

unless some other agency finds there to be a violation.
MR. ALITO:
Your Honor.

I wouldn't say they don't care.

It is simply a recognition that one

6 administrative agency, even though required to implement
7

the public interest, cannot be expected to do the work

8 of all the other administrative agencies.
9

QUESTION:

So it is a — I asked you earlier

10

in this argument, didn't they say, it is irrelevant

11

until and unless some other agency decides there has

12

been a violation?

Because they had no hearing.

QUESTION:

It is true in that sense.

Whether

But not the general

Yes, because they felt that they

were at least in line with Commission policy.
MR. ALITO:

They felt they were in line with

the Commission policy of not imposing mandatory

20 requirements at this time.
21

QUESTION:

Insofar as 504 is concerned , isn't

22 it a fairly orthodox application of primary jurisdiction
23
24
25

on behalf of one agency for another?
MR. ALITO:

I believe it is, Your Honor.

It

is what the Commission does in cases of allegations of

Thank you.

5

QUESTION*

Frequently in our opinions and

6 questions we refer to the alleged expertise, the
7

accumulated experience of these regulatory agencies.

8 Isn't that a factor to be taken into account, whether,
9

as Justice Rehnquist suggested, this is a primary

10

responsibility of the FCC, to delve into a subject

11

where another agency has total control?
MR. ALITO*

12

I believe the FCC's expertise is

13

very relevant in this sense.

The Commission has brought

14

its expertise to bear upon the problem of captioning,

15

and has developed an approach, and if the Court of

16

Appeals had applied the correct test, it would have

17

sustained the FCC's exercise of its expert judgment in

18

this case.

19

hardly be sustained in the name of the Commission’s

The decision of the Court of Appeals can

20 expertise, when that is precisely what it upset.
21

There is something a little bit strange, I

22 admit, on its face, about the FCC, the expert in the
23

area of broadcasting, deferring to a funding agency, but

24

this is where Congress allocated that responsibility,

25

and what Section 504 is about, at least in part, is how

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

an agency’s funds are spent, and the FCC is not — does

2 not claim particular expertise as to how the funds of
3

the Department of Education or another funding agency

4

should be spent.

Thank you.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS IN BOTH CASES

9

MR. FIRESTONE;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, I represent Sue Gottfried and the

11

Greater Los Angeles Council on Deafness, who in turn

12

represent the estimated five and a half to eighteen

13

million severely hearing impaired people who have been

14

subject to a history of discrimination generally and

15

largely excluded from participation in and denied the

16

benefits of our nation’s pervasive and influential

17

television system.

22 ''discrimination,'’ what do you mean?
23
24
25

MR. FIRESTONE;

Certainly that is a term of

art with respect to —
QUESTION;

Well, I am just wondering — it

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

must be in your mind, so how is it defined in your

2 mind?

HR. FIRESTONE;

3

I think in the case of 504, I

4 think discrimination means failure to — indifference,
5 exclusion, and failure to remove barriers that are at
6 least reasonably accommodable.

QUESTION;

7

You don’t suggest it means

8 purposeful discrimination because somebody can’t hear?

MR. FIRESTONE;

9

Well, I think that is part of

10 the definition of discrimination
11

as well, and certainly

that --

12

QUESTION;

Somebody is discriminating against

13 them because they can’t hear?
14

MR. FIRESTONE;

15

QUESTION;

16

HR. FIRESTONE;

No.

Is that what you are saying?
It is hard to believe that

17 that would be the case.
18

QUESTION;

That isn't what you really mean, is

19 it?
20

HR. FIRESTONE;

21

QUESTION;

No, although that --

You mean they are discriminating in

22 the sense they don’t have the same opportunity.

23

MR. FIRESTONE;

Yes, they ace denied equal

24 access, more or less, and denied -25

They are not provided equal access.

MR. FIRESTONE:

2 accommodations.

Not provided by reasonable

Now, it is possible that, as the

3

Commission has held, that the policy of exclusion can be

4

inferred from — excuse me, a policy of discrimination

5

can be inferred from a policy of exclusion of

6 minorities,

or a policy of indifference.

The Commission

7 has held that in a couple of cases, so that it is very
8 possible that as a legal matter there would be
9

discrimination, although somebody does not have the

10

animus, which is hard to believe, that somebody would

11

actually discriminate against the disabled.
QUESTION:

12

Well, if this Court or any court,

13

for example, which is open to the public does not

14

provide amplifying equipment so that people who are hard

15

of hearing either can't follow the proceedings or have

16

great difficulty, is that a discrimination?
MR. FIRESTONE:

17

Well, certainly you are not

18

under any obligation, legal obligation, as is in this

19

case, but I think that — and I would also preface by

20 saying that the Court has been accommodating to --

21

Must it?

Must it?

That is the

22 question.

MR. FIRESTONE;

2

QUESTION;

You mean, if the Court —

Do I understand your answer that it

3 is not discriminatory not to provide caption, immediate
4 translation of everything that is going on here for the
5 benefit of the audience?
6

MR. FIRESTONE;

Actually, I am — I don't know

7 if the Court is considered -- you mean, under Section
8 504, or just generally discrimination?
9

QUESTION;

No, generally.

The term

10 discrimination isn't limited to this statute.

It is a

11 broad term.
12

MR. FIRESTONE;

I think what is required is

13 reasonable accommodation under the standard of Davis and
14 other cases that have looked at what is discrimination
15 against the disabled.

Reasonable accommodation might

18 mean allowing signing, as the Court has done.

It may

17 mean — or the case of a lawyer who wants to argue, to
18 allow for simultaneous captioning.

I think the Court's

ig record in this area is exemplary, but not to allow -20 not to have amplification equipment that may or may not
21 help other people I don't think is required.
22

QUESTION;

Well, are we subject to 504?

MR. FIRESTONE;

MR. FIRESTONE;

I don't think so.

NR. FIRESTONE:

My hypothetical questions were put

to you in your use of the word "discrimination."

20

MR. FIRESTONE:

21

QUESTION:

22 other statute.
23

Yes.

Which is not limited to 504 or any

It is a very broad term.

MR. FIRESTONE:

Right, and I think that I was

24

somewhat careful not to only use the word

25

"discrimination,” but also use the other words of the

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

statute, which say not to exclude from the benefits or

2 deny participation.

In other words, the statute, I

3 think, still given the Davis case, which says that it
4 really is talking about intentional discrimination, but
5 it also goes on to say that discrimination, there is a
6 fine line between

discrimination and failure to afford

7 affirmative action, illegal discrimination versus
8 affirmative action.

9

I think that 504 was definitely intended to

10 allow for access by the disabled to America *s
11

institutions.

12 Magna Carta

It was really a step forward.

Is was the

of civil rights for the disabled, and in

13 this case, I think that Congress also intended that this
14 Magna Carta be taken into account not simply by an
15 occasional funding agency or at the whim of the funding
16 agency, but by all the government.
17

The issue in this case is whether or not one

18 government -- the one government institution which is
19 charged with the overall regulation of television may
20 ignore or find irrelevant Congressional policy designed
21

to aid the handicapped when it considers a license

MR. FIRESTONE;

No, the Commission has one

9

When it

adopted these policies, when it looked, you know, at

10

this application, it did not take into account the fact

11

that Congress intended that those who are disabled have

12

access to the communications system.

13

here about the communications handicapped, the people

14

who really don't have the opportunity to partake in this

15

system, and here is an opportunity not only to include

16

them, but certainly to look at how the recipients of

17

federal financial assistance, those who are under a

18

specific law, to apply this standard of inclusion, of

19

non-discrimination, however we want to describe the

We are talking

20 dictates of 504.
21

It had an opportunity to bring them into the

The Commission is arguing that there was — I

2 think what they have to be arguing is that the
3

legislative history intended that they not consider,

4

because at the time of the passage of Section 504, the

5

FCC did consider allegations of discrimination,

6 allegations of employment discrimination as well as
7

programming discrimination, whether or not there is an

8 EEOC in existence, and Congress
9

just intended to adopt a

civil rights law for the disabled as it has for the

minorities and women, and for them to say that the FCC

11

is intended not to enforce this, or — excuse me.

correct?

But I -- the special

7 circumstances of this case are not only what the Court

a further decision had been made by the Department of

12

by the way, they are not even considering factors that

relate to the license period, which is the period in

QUESTION:

Mr. Firestone, that makes me -- I

16

We would like to see a rule of broad applicability.

MR. FIRESTONE:

The Commission can choose

QUESTION:

Well, Judge McGowan said they ought

22 to proceed by rulemaking,

rulemaking, but they specifically declined to adopt a

2 rule.

Now, when we come before them in an adjudication,

3 they say, there is no rule, therefore we won’t consider
4 it.

I mean, it's a Catch 22 that the deaf are faced

5 with.

Now, how does the agency that is charged with

18 the right to broadcast to everyone but the few licensees
ig who get these licenses, and once they have those
20 licenses, they are public trustees accountable now every
21 five years to the government, and to the people, and how

must — cannot ignore the dictates of 504.

When they

fact that Congress intended that the deaf have some

8 access, that they not be ignored, and that certainly was

the thrust of the Court .of Appeals* decision.

Has the FCC also required that all

emergency messages be visually transmitted?

HR. FIRESTONE;

QUESTION;

Yes.

But of course —

And it said that if the agency

charged with primary enforcement of 504 determines there

15

is a violation, it will take that into account?

16

HR. FIRESTONE;

Well, I don't think they could

17

have taken it into account in this decision without

18

actually proceeding with revocation action, because they

did not condition the outcome of this proceeding on the

Didn’t the station make some

to this provision, that it had a statutory exemption

from program control or something to that affect?
MR. FIRESTONE:

6

Well, the Court of Appeals

7 disposed of it in a footnote.

QUESTION:

8

Yes.

Hell, if we get back to your

9

contention that all these things ought to be originally

10

thrashed out before the FCC, does that really make much

11

sense, if it is deciding a fairly complicated question

12

of — wouldn’t you want the agency charged with the

13

statutory mandate whose administrative interpretation

14

would be entitled to considerable weight to make those

kind of determinations in the first place?
MR. FIRESTONE:

16

Well, I don’t see how the fact

17

that the licensee got £5 million in federal money in

18

1977, and how they have gotten something like 30 percent

19

of their money from federal subsidies can be a difficult

20 question as to whether or not they are subject to 504.

QUESTION:

Now, this Court has said countless

agencies have broad, very broad discretion as to what

8 they will weigh and take into account.
9

Now, if an

agency has exercised that discretion and come up with

what someone regards as a wrong decision, isn't the

review of that decision limited to an abuse of

MR. FIRESTONE:

MR. FIRESTONE:

Yes, there was an abuse

of discretion by failing to consider a relevant factor,

But in the end, it is really the FCC that must

The fact

20 that this licensee is subject to this law is simply — I

mean, is very importantly a factor to be taken into

22 account when they look at whether or not a licensee is

I think that Congress intended in the

3 legislative history of Section 504 that this would be a
4 broad policy, and I would like to bring the Court to the
5 cases where the Court has said that the FCC cannot
6 ignore a relevant statute.

Let me give you an example

7 of one that the Commission cites in its EEO rules,
8 the National

Labor Relations Board wanted to reinstate

9 some employees on a
10 court found
11

where

ship who had struck and in fact the

that this was a violation of the mutiny,

that the actual strike happened to be a violation of the

12 mutiny laws, and they said,

you cannot apply the

13 National Labor Relations Act without considering other
14 relevant statutes to this matter.
15

There is no question that Congress intended

16 this law to be a broad policy to include the deaf,
17 include the disabled, and what the Commission is saying,
18 and I think quite clearly, today, is, this is not
19 something that we must take into account when we have —
20 make our independent public interest standard, and there
21

are plenty of cases, including the United Church of

22 Christ case,

which say that the Commission must look at

23 the facts of that case.

Remeber, in that case they

24 tried to defer the question of the discrimination.

It

25 is a very similar situation.

67

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

They are saying,

you must consider part of the public interest, A, B, and

MR. FIRESTONE:

11

Because the Commission abused

12 its discretion by failing to consider this relevant
13

factor which they agree is relevant.

The Commission

14

itself said, well, we will take this into account at a

15

later time, perhaps, although they didn't condition —

16

they didn't do the formal action that they needed to do

17

in order to take that into account, but where there is a

18

relevant statute, certainly they must consider -- this

19

is — says the same where the court says, okay, when we

20 look over — the reviewing standard is arbitrary,
21

capricious, abuse of standard, or abiding by law, and

22 part of that discussion and search, scrutiny by the
23

court is whether or not they considered all relevant

24

factors.

2 and the submissions were so confusing and the technology
3

in such a state of flux that they declined to issue any

rule, that it just wasn't timely to issue a rule right

5

now, and then the next day this submission is made, that

6 the license should be denied because of failure to live

Can’t the Commission say, awfully sorry, but

8 it just isn’t — now is just not the time to do that?
