CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

first this morning in Bolger against Youngs Drug

Products Corporation.

Mr. Strauss, you may proceed whenever you are
ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS, ESQ.

9

MR. STRAUSS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court.

10

Section 3001(e)(2) of Title 39 of the United

11

States Code prohibits the mailing of unsolicited

12

advertisements for contraceptive products.

13

3001(e)(2) does not prohibit any mailing that the

14

recipient has indicated a desire to receive.

15

in this case is whether that statute violates the First

16

Amendment.

Section

The issue

This action was brought by the appellee, which

17

18

has been a manufacturer of contraceptive products for

19

some 60 years, and is by its own account the leader in

20

the field.

21

Until 1979, appellee promoted its products by

22

means of a sales force and advertisements in magazines.

23

In 1979, after what appellee describes as business

24

discussions, appellee inaugurated a new marketing

25

strategy that included in addition to its other

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

traditional means of advertising a campaign of mass

2

unsolicited mailings to members of the general public at

3

large.
The Postal Service advised appellee that these

4
5

mailings would violate Section 3001(e)(2), and appellee

6

then brought this suit in the United States District

7

Court for the District of Columbia# alleging that

8

Section 3001(e)(2) violated the Constitution, and

9

seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.
The District Court found that appellee's

10
11

mailings are commercial solicitations and promotional

12

materials in which appellee has a commercial interest.

13

It accordingly declared that they are commercial speech,

14

entitled to lesser protection under the First

15

Amendment.

16

Section 3001(e)(2) directly furthers specific and

17

important government interests.

The District Court also concluded that

But the District Court nonetheless declared

18
19

Section 3001(e)(2) unconstitutional because it believed

20

that it could devise an alternative that, while not

21

protecting the government's interests quite as well,

22

struck what the District Court viewed as a better

23

balance.

24

central feature was a series of warnings in large

25

letters on the outside of appellee's unsolicited

That alternative was highly elaborate.

Its

4

1

mailings
The District Court ordered its alternative

2
3

into effect and enjoined the enforcement of Section

4

3001(e)(2).

We then brought this appeal.

Unlike restrictions on commercial expression

5
6

that this Court has invalidated in the past, Section

7

3001(e)(2) is a narrow and specific limitation, and its

8

effect on First Amendment rights can only be described

9

as minimal.

It has no application to any form of

10

non-commercial speech. For that reason, organizations

11

that advocate birth control or family planning as a

12

social or moral matter are free to do so by using the

13

mails, even by using the mails on an unsolicited basis.

14

Section 3001(e)(2) also has no application to

15

a wide range of advertising, including all the methods

16

of advertising that appellee itself has used so

17

successfully for so long.

18

application to advertising that does not use the mail,

19

and it does not have any application to much advertising

20

that does.

21

advertisements in magazines or other publications that

22

are sent through the mail so long as the recipient has

23

indicated a desire to receive the publication.

24
25

It does not have any

For example, it does not apply to

And it has no application even to unsolicited
advertising that is mailed to persons with a

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC, '
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

professional interest in conctraception, such as

2

physicians and pharmacists and dealers.

3

of course, particularly physicians and pharmacists, can

4

counsel and advise others on the use of contraception.

5

These people,

But most important. Section 3001(e)<2) does

6

not prevent any person from receiving any of appellee's

7

mailings if appellee only obtains his consent, and

8

appellee can even use the mail in an effort to obtain

9

his consent, because Section 3001(e)(2) as interpreted

10

by the Postal Service does not prohibit a premailing in

11

which an advertiser asks a postal customer to consent to

12

receiving a line of contraceptive advertisements.

13

QUESTION*

Of course, in the real world, I

14

suppose that when you are asking for what is basically

15

consent to receive junk mail, most people would say, no,

16

I don't want to receive it, whereas if they could send

17

it directly, there is some chance, I suppose, that the

18

advertisement might sell them on getting the stuff.

19

HR. STRAUSS*

Well, that may be right, and I

20

assume that is why Youngs Drug is so interested in

21

sending unsolicited mailings, but there is no First

22

Amendment interest in forcing publications or

23

information on people who don't want to receive it.

24
25

QUESTION*

Do you think that Congress could

prohibit the mailing of any kind of junk mail without

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the consent of the recipient?
MS. STRAUSS:

2
3

All kinds, let's say?

All kinds of commercial

mailings?

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

5

MS. STRAUSS:

I think Congress may well have

6

that power.

Of course, such a measure would present

7

issues not presented here, because it would be far

8

broader, and it would answer to far less specific

9

government interests, but I think Congress may —
QUESTION:

10

Now, in this instance there are

11

other types of so-called potentially offensive material

12

that could be mailed under this statute and aren't

13

prohibited, right?
MR. STRAUSS:

14

There are other -- other

15

materials that don't pertain to contraception that could

16

be mailed under the statute.

That's right.

17

These premailings efforts by an advertiser to

18

obtain consent to mail its products could be a separate

19

mailing, or they could be a part of another mailing

20

advertising other products so that the advertiser

21

wouldn't have to spend the extra postage, or of course

22

they needn't be mailed at all.

23

distributed with a product or distributed at a drug

24

store.

25

They could be

The only effect therefore of the statute that

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the District Court struck down is to require advertisers

2

like the appellee to use some means, any means to see

3

whether the persons to whom they are sending their ads

4

are willing to receive them.

5

At the same time, as even the District Court

6

acknowledged. Section 3001(e)(2) directly advances

7

important government interests.

8

legitimately wish that if they so desire, they, and not

9

appellee, or some other advertiser trying to sell its

First, parents can

10

wares, will be the first to introduce their children to

11

contraception and related subjects.

12

advertisements for contraception -- for contraceptive

13

products are allowed in the mails, it is simply

14

inevitable that some of them will fall into the hands of

15

children, against the wishes of their parents.

16

Eut if unsolicited

The second, in the area of commercial speech,

17

and particularly commercial speech that enters the home,

18

Congress has the power to regulate expression on the

19

ground that it may be offensive to its audience.

20

would be a significant expansion and an unwarranted

21

expansion of the protection the Court has accorded to

22

commercial speech to say that it cannot be regulated on

23

the basis of its offensiveness.

24
25

It

Contraception is a subject of particular
intimacy and privacy and delicacy, so much so that it

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., 3.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

has a special constitutional status, and there is no

2

doubt that many people will find commercial

3

solicitations about such a subject to be offensive.
QUESTION*

4

Your view is — I know the statute

5

permits it, but supposing the statute prohibited the

6

mailing of its promotional material by a charitable

7

foundation or something like Planned Parenthood.

8

think Congress could constitutionally prohibit it on the

9

same grounds, that it might fall into the hands of

10

children?
MR. STRAUSS:

11

12

Do you

That would depend on whether the

mailings constituted commercial speech, which would be —
QUESTION:

13

What I am really asking you is, if

14

you get out of the commercial speech category, do you

15

think the statute would stand?
MR. STRAUSS*

16

We don't claim that such a

17

prohibition could be applied to non-commercial speech,

18

no.

19
20
21

QUESTION*

In fact, you acquiesced in a

holding in some other case.
MR. STRAUSS*

22

District Court decision.

23

appellees —

24
25

QUESTION:

Yes, Associated Students, a
That’s right.

The

Could the legislative branch

accomplish the same objective of the statute along the

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

lines of the statute that we dealt with in the Rowan

2

case, where they could put up a barrier and say, we

3

don't want any mail from this company?

4

accomplish this purpose?
MR. STRAUSS:

5

Would that

That particular statute, of

6

course, would not achieve this purpose, since people

7

would have to certify that they found these

8

advertisements sexually arousing.
QUESTION:

9

Well, I don't mean to make a carbon

10

copy of the statute, but to just give each householder

11

the privilege of saying, I don't want any mail from

12

Sears Roebuck Company, or from Montgomery Ward, or from

13

anybody.

14

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, it wouldn't accomplish the

15

legislature’s purposes for a number of reasons.

16

first place, of course, someone would have to receive at

17

least one mailing from that company before he knew that

18

he didn't want any further mailings from that company,

19

so he would be open to at least one mailing from every

20

advertiser for these products.

21

In the

And second, that — such a measure might very

22

well have the effect of being a greater burden on the

23

values that the First Amendment is designed to protect

24

than the statute at issue here, because presumably the

25

advertiser, which in the case of a drug company is

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

likely to have many other items of importance to

2

advertise, would cut off all mailings to that customer.

3

In fact, in the statute you suggest, Mr. Chief Justice,

4

that seems to be precisely what it would require.
And since the point of the constitutional

5
6

protection for commercial expression is to ensure that

7

information reaches potential consumers, such a statute

8

would defeat the purpose of that protection to a large

9

degree.

10

And the third thing —

11

QUESTIONj

Mr. Strauss, you have advanced two

12

goals, anyway.

What evidence is there in the record

13

that these goals were in the minds of Congress?
MR. STRAUSS*

14

Well, we have two pieces of

15

evidence.

16

the legislative history that contraception is a matter

17

of personal choice, which statement accompanied the

18

repeal of sweeping prohibitions on the circulation of

19

information about contraception and the replacement of

20

those sweeping prohibitions with this much more narrow

21

and specific limitation.

22

The first is Congress's explicit statement in

And the second, again, the best possible

23

evidence of Congress's intent, which is the statute

24

itself, permits unsolicited mailings to persons like

25

physicians and pharmacists who are in a position to give

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

out advice to those who seek it.

2

tailored entirely to prevent commercial solicitations

3

from reaching those who do not want to receive them,

4

while permitting the broadest possible circulation of

5

information about contraception to those who do want to

6

receive it.

7

8
9

QUESTIONS

The statute is

Maybe there are some physicians who

don’t want to receive it.
MR. STRAUSS*

Well, that may be right,

10

although Congress apparently made a judgment that the

11

importance of putting this information into the hands of

12

physicians so that they could pass it on was great

13

enough, and that physicians in their professional

14

capacity would be less likely to be offended and less

15

likely to have children who could —

16
17
18

QUESTION*

Is there anything in the record to

the effect that these are offensive to recipients?
MR. STRAUSS*

That was not an issue litigated

19

below, but again. Justice Blackmun, on an issue like

20

that, it is difficult to see what sort of evidence could

21

be introduced in a trial court that would measure up to

22

the judgment of Congress, which after all is in an

23

excellent position to report on what its constituents

24

find offensive.

25

QUESTION*

Well, all you have to do is bring

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

in 100 people who say, it's offensive to me

2

He do it every day in trial.

3

MR. STRAUSS*

That is

Well, it might be possible for

4

the other side to bring in 100 people — or a Gallup

5

poll.

6

QUESTION s

Of course.

7

MR. STRAUSS*

I think — I mean, I understand

8

the point. Justice Blackmun, but I think the underlying

9

question is that the underlying thing to keep in mind is

10

that Congress is uniquely well positioned to express a

11

judgment on a question like what are people likely to

12

find offensive, and what sorts of materials do people

13

want to keep out of the hands of their children,

14

certainly at least as well positioned to express a

15

judgment on an issue like that as it is to express a

16

judgment on a technical factual issue on which this

17

Court would unhesitatingly defer to it.

18
19

QUESTION*

Of course, an argument could be

made it is rather underinclusive, isn't it?

20

MR. STRAUSS*

21

QUESTION*

22

23

Because it excludes --

Because it doesn't exclude a lot of

other, much more offensive material.
MR. STRAUSS*

Well, there are a couple of

24

possible categories of material that appellees have

25

argued about.

They have argued about solicited

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

mailings.

They have argued about non-commercial

2

mailings.

As far as non-commercial mailings are

3

concerned, in light of — by following the logic of the

4

Court's decision in Metromedia, or at least the

5

plurality's opinion in Metromedia, it is open to

6

Congress simply to decide that non-commercial mailings

7

are more valuable, and for that reason have to be

8

allowed even if they are equally offensive, and equally

9

likely to interfere with the lines of communication

10
11

12

between parents and children.
And beyond that, I think it is quite
reasonable for Congress to say that an effort by an

3

organization interested in the subject as a moral matter

4

to contribute to the debate and enlighten people simply

5

is less likely to be the kind of interference parents

6

would want to resist than the commercial soliciations of

7

someone whose only interest is in selling its products.

8

QUESTION*

Mr. Strauss, would it arguably, at

9

least, be less restrictive if Congress provided a means

20

whereby any homeowner could say, don't mail to me or to

21

deliver to my home anything related to contraceptive

22

advertisements or other specific categories?

23

less restrictive, to let people do that?

24
25

MR. STRAUSS:

I don't think it is.

Is that

That, of

course, bears some resemblance to the hypothetical

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

statute that the Chief Justice asked me about earlier.

2

I don't think that's less restrictive even of First

3

Amendment rights.

4

obvious administrative burdens and the obvious problem

5

that people would have to know to invoke that

6

prerogative under the statute, even from the point of

7

view of First Amendment values, it might very well be

8

that an advertiser or a drug company would not find it

9

profitable to maintain two mailing lists, one a mailing

The effect of that/ apart from the

10

list of people who didn't want contraceptive

11

advertisements, and the other one a mailing list of

12

people who did.
QUESTIONS

13

Well, but under this very scheme

14

you are offering, they have to do something like that

15

for anyone under the legislation that has already been

16

approved in some areas.

17

that.

18

Kailers have to do exactly

Isn't that the case?
HE. STRAUSSs

Well, if they choose to acquire

19

solicitations.

Of course, as long as you are going to

20

protect the interest of unwilling recipients in not

21

receiving these materials, two mailing lists would be

22

necessary, but that is why this — the alternative you

23

suggest, Justice O'Connor, might well not be less

24

protective of First Amendment rights, because it might

25

have the effect of cutting off access to a lot of other

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

information, very useful information about drugs to

2

people who want to receive them but don’t want to

3

receive contraceptive advertisements.

4

Also, I think it was part of Congress's --

I don’t know why you can argue that

it would be less restrictive than a total ban.

curious.

9

KR. STRAUSSi

I am

Well, it would be less — well,

it would be more restrictive to the extent that it would

10

not only keep people from receiving information about

11

contraceptives, but also information about other

12

products advertised by or manufactured by the same

13

mailer, because that mailer might not find it useful to

14

send out any — profitable to send out any — efficient

15

to send out any advertisements at all to that recipient.

16

Also, I think it was part of Congress's

17

purpose clearly to take the burden off the unwilling

18

recipients who don't want these materials in their

19

homes, and leave it to be assimilated in the costs of

20

advertising on the advertiser.

appellee suggests, that people can do a variety of

No, but without having a record

Well, if they know that it is

I think that's right, and I

think for some of the same reasons that the Court has

19

said overbreadth does not apply to -- the overbreadth

20

doctrine does not apply to commercial speech, there is

21

good reason not to apply the less restrictive

Well, is the least restrictive

Does the reason why the material is

supposing someone is a Christian Scientist, doesn't

well, because of that potential for offending a person

of that religious faith, we will have a statute

prohibiting the advertising of any kind of

MR. STRAUSS:

In other words,

Could you say,

I think when offensiveness is an

asserted justification for a statute, the Court has to

scrutinize what Congress has done to some degree to make

2

sure that it is at least a common sense judgment.
QUESTION;

3

Does it have to be a viewpoint

4

neutral kind of offensiveness* or can the offensiveness

5

lie in the fact that there are many people who as a

matter of religious faith don’t believe contraceptives

should be used?

are talking about* or is it there is something about the

MR. STRAUSS*

3

It was survival after most of

considered vastly more important were repealed in 1971.
QUESTION*

6

Well, but what is offensive about

7

this material other than the aspects of it that Mr.

8

Comstock thought were offensive?

9
10

MR. STRAUSS* Well, there are a variety of
«
things that might be offensive. Some people might

simply object — are likely simply to object to any

commercial treatment of a subject of such importance and

13

intimacy.

14

of commercial treatment of it a corruption of the

15

subject, even if they are very much in favor of the

16

practice of contraception.

17

Some people might find that — the very fact

Had Congress wanted to discourage people from

18

practicing contraception, or to restrict the flow of

19

information so that people would be less likely to

20

practice contraception, it is unthinkable that Congress

21

would have done what it did when it passed this statute,

22

which is to sweep away all of the most important

23

restrictions on the circulation of information.

24
25

QUESTION*

Well, but even what remains

certainly restricts the flow of information on this

Mr. Strauss, do you concede that

MR. STRAUSS:

I think the application of that

that to commercial speech is different.

9

quite clear that the fact that advertising for one

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Strauss?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS, ESQ.
REBUTTAL
MR. STRAUSS:
Three points.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
First, this statute was passed

in the 1970's, not the 1870's.

When it was passed,

Congress swept away all restrictions on mailings,
non-commercial mailings, all restrictions on solicited

48
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

commercial mailings, and many important restrictions on
unsolicited commercial mailings, and Congress did so
while it was avowing that contraception is a matter of
individual personal choice.
I would also point out that in 1970, when
Congress considered and passed the statute, it was five
years before Bigelow and six years before Virginia
Pharmacy.

At that time it was black letter law that all

commercial speech could be regulated without regard to
the First Amendment, and had Congress wanted to come as
close as it could to —

MR. STRAUSS*

Mell, it was so considered in

1970.
QUESTION:

By whom?

HR. STRAUSS*

Well, by all the lower courts,

and presumably by Congress had it wanted to see it close
to the line, Justice Blackmun.

We all recognize the

validity of subsequent criticisms, but even in
Pittsburgh Plate Glass in 1973, the Court still treated

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Valentine against Christianson as the law.

2

Had Congress wanted to suppress as much

3

information about contraception as it possibly could

4

have or had it wanted to act out of antipathy to

5

contraception, it would have — it would not have

6

eliminated so many restrictions on commercial expression

7

as it did.
Second, Lamont, which was just introduced now

8
9

by appellee, involved — required — the statute in that

10

case required a willing recipient to acknowledge to the

11

government that he wanted to receive political mailings

12

that the government had declared to be subversive.

13

is obviously worlds removed from a premailing to a

14

private advertiser in this case.
Third, appellee insists that he doesn't want

16

to send these to unwilling recipients, or so it seems.

17

And that this problem could be constitutionally solved

18

by allowing unwilling recipients to cut off the

19

mailings.

20

this case is, who is going to bear the burden?

21

unwilling recipient have to buy a locked mailbox or make

22

an extra trip to the post office, certify that these

23

materials are sexually arousing and erotically
