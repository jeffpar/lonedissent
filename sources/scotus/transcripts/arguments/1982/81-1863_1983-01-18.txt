11

ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, ET AL., APPELLANTS
HR. LEEi

12
13
14

And

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Courts
At issue in this case is the constitutionality

15

of 40 U.S.C. Section 13k which prohibits picketing,

16

leafletting, and demonstrating in the Supreme Court

17

building and on its grounds.

18

section, 13p defines the Supreme Court grounds as

19

extending to the curb of each of the four streets

20

enclosing the block on which the building is located.

21

A related statutory

The Appellees, Zywicki and Grace, after making

22

several attempts between May of 1978 and March of 1980

23

to distribute leaflets or demonstrate with a sign on the

24

Supreme Court grounds, and on each occasion being

25

informed by Supreme Court police officers that the

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

conduct was prohibited, brought this action seeking a

2

declaratory judgment that Section 13k's ban is

3

unconstitutional.

4

action, and the Court of Appeals by a two-to-one

5

decision held the statute unconstitutional on its face.

The District Court dismissed their

Section 13k is a content-neutral congressional

6
7

restriction on a place within which one manner of First

8

Amendment activity, demonstrating and leafletting, may

9

occur.
This Court made it clear in Heffron versus

10

11

Krishna Consciousness that time, place, or manner

12

restrictions have been upheld providing three criteria

13

are satisfied.

14

content-neutral; second, that it must serve a

15

significant governmental interest; and third, that it

16

leaves open ample alternative channels for communication.

They are*

first, that it must be

This statute clearly applies to all

17
18

demonstrating and leafletting activity without regard to

19

content.

20

significance of the governmental interests and the

21

adequacy of alternative channels for communication.

22

The remaining issues therefore concern the

QUESTION*

Generally, do you think that a

23

regulation which in effect says no time, no place, no

24

manner can really be called a time, place, and manner

25

regulation?

1

MR. LEEs

Clearly, vjfiere it leaves open, if

2

that is the reason for the alternative — adequacy of

3

the alternative channels inquiry.

4

versus Spock, there was no opportunity for political

5

advertising or political activity within the military,

6

for instance.

7

QUESTIONi

Just as in Greer

Well, I for one wouldn't think of

8

Greer versus Spock as a time, place, and manner

9

restriction.

10

I think of it as a no-public-forum case.

MR. LEEs

Well, it — it may be -- it may be

11

that in addition.

12

the notion that there are certain kinds of places where

13

certain kinds of activity are not to be permitted.

14

this is not a restriction on all types of First

15

Amendment expression.

16

of expression; namely, picketing, leafletting and

17

demonstrating within an identified place, the same as

18

you had in Heffron and in Greer versus Spock and in

19

Grayned versus City of Rockford.

20

But the no-public-forum concept is

And

It is a restriction on one type

So that what is brought into place so long as

21

it is content-neutral is the consideration of the

22

comparative interest of the government on the one hand

23

in identifying a certain limited place in which one

24

manner of restriction is to be upheld, and also the

25

alternative means of communication.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

With regard to the congressional objective,

2

the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the government

3

does have a substantial interest in restricting

4

picketing and other forms of expression in or near

5

courthouses, but concluded that these legitimate

6

concerns are fully addressed by another statute,

7

U.S.C. Section 1507, which prohibits picketing or

8

parading in or near any federal courthouse with the

9

intent of influencing a judge, juror, witness, or court

10
11

18

officer.
The Court of Appeals reasoning that Section

12

13k is outside Congress' constitutional authority

13

because its purposes are adequately accomplished by

14

another statute is flawed in several respects.

15

The first is that it is a non sequitur.

I

16

know of no authority, and the Court of Appeals certainly

17

suggested none, to support the proposition that the

18

Constitution prohibits Congress from enacting two

19

separate statutes that address the same problem in

20

overlapping ways.

21

Indeed, that proposition is squarely rejected

22

by this Court's holding in O'Brien, United States versus

23

O'Brien, that the existence of a statute prohibiting

24

non-possession of a draft card did not interdict an

25

overlapping statute prohibiting mutilation.

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Second, the Court of Appeals premise is in

2

fact incorrect.

3

one of Section 13k*s purposes; namely, attempts to

4

influence the courts' decisions.

5

reaches another congressional objective that is not

6

covered by Section

7

is, protection against the appearance of impropriety,

8

against the inference that the processes of the Nation's

9

highest Court are or may be influenced by demonstrators

10

Section

1507 but is equally legitimate; that

13k stands as a congressional

assurance to the people of this Nation —

13
14

QUESTION;

Well, does the statute do that, or

the person who pickets do that?

15

MR. LEE;

16

QUESTION;

17

But Section 13k also

or leafletters.

11
12

It is true that Section 1507 overlaps

It is just —
What -- what infers that this Court

would be influenced by one person holding a sign?

NR. LEE;

18

The inference against which Congress

19

may legitimately protect is the inference that would be

20

drawn by the people that because of the mere existence

21

of picketers on the Supreme Court grounds, that the

22

Court's decisions are in fact influenced by that kind of

23

process.

QUESTION;

24
25

It —
Well, is that what Congress has

said?

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. LEEi

1

What Congress has said is that

2

picketing and demonstrating activity within the narrow

3

space of the Supreme Court block is incompatible with

4

the traditional purposes for which this Court is to be

5

used.

6

properly have taken into — into account were the same

7

consideration that this Court relied upon in Cox versus

8

Louisiana, and I am quoting, that "A state may protect

9

against the possibility of a conclusion by the public

Among the considerations that Congress could

10

that the Judge's action was, in part, a product of

11

intimidation and did not flow only from the fair and

12

orderly working of the judicial process."
Significant in that respect. Justice Marshall,

13
14

in our view, is the distinction between the holding in

15

Cox and that in Edwards versus South Carolina.

16

two cases were handed down within just a couple cf years

17

of each other.

18

demonstration-type activities, one of which was held

1

legislative body are not only compatible with the

2

legislative function# they reflect the fact that in our

3

representative system of government the pressure of

4

popular opinion is properly brought to bear on

5

legislative policy makers.
By contrast, as this Court observed in Cox#

6
7

government may protect not only against such pressure in

8

fact being brought against the courts, it may also

9

protect — and this is a quote from this Court's opinion

10

in that case — "the judicial process from being

11

misjudged in the minds of the public."

12

Court said just last term in Clements versus Fashing,

13

that whereas a legislator will vote with due regard for

14

constituent views, it is a serious accusation that a

15

judge made a politically motivated decision.
QUESTION:

16

And as this

Mr. Solicitor General, how can that

17

interest justify prohibiting the leafletting in this

18

case involving some Central American political situation?
MR. LEEs

19

That is precisely my point. Justice

20

Stevens.

21

is directed toward the Court and its activities, which

22

wouldn't —

23

It is the distinction between activity which

QUESTION*

But that leafletting couldn't even

24

affect the appearance, which is your present

25

justification, I understand.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. LEE*

1

No, but it could affect the

2

appearance, because permitting the leafletter and the

3

demonstrator, the sign carrier and the leaflet

4

distributor on the grounds of the court —
QUESTION:

5
6

Just confine it to the leafletter

about South American politics, where you have no cases HR. LEEs

7

Whether it is about South American

8

politics or whatever, the mere presence on the grounds

9

of that person engaging in that kind of activity leads

10

to a possible inference that that kind of activity may

11

influence the Court's decisions, because passersby,

12

observers of that activity, may very well not read what

13

is in fact on the leaflet and only draw the inference

14

that leafletting is in fact occurring and may have an

15

influence on the Court's decision, regardless of the

16

content.

17

that this Court has recognized in a number of contexts.

18

It's the speech-plus kind of notion that —

QUESTION!

Well, if that's a sufficient

19

justification, I suppose the statute could extend across

20

the street, too.

21

HR. LEEs

The matter of linedrawing is a

22

difficult one.

And it could extend across the street.

23

And your point, of course, illustrates just how narrow

24

really is the disagreement between the government and

25

our opponents, because everyone agrees, I take it — the

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Court of Appeals, the Appellees, and the Amicus

that

2

Congress could properly prohibit any kind of leafletting

3

or other activity within the building itself.
So that the only spatial issue that we're

4
5

talking about in the protection of this kind of interest

6

is whether you can extend it, whether Congress can

7

extend it, from the edge of the building to the edge of

8

the curb.

9

Now, it could, of course, be extended across

10

the street, which would make it — and in my opinion,

11

that would also be constitutional — but those kinds of

12

lines are the kinds of lines that are traditionally

13

drawn by legislatures and they reflect the kind of

14

policy kind of judgment that we have traditionally

15

entrusted to the legislatures.

16

QUESTIONi

17

had to raise it in this case.

18

within the building, but is it in your mind perfectly

19

clear that the statute could prohibit the wearing of a

20

campaign button within the building, for example?

21

MR. LEE*

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. LEE:

Mr. Solicitor General, they haven't
You're talking about

I have some question of whether —
And that statute may do that.
Yes.

I have some question whether

24

the wearing of a campaign button would actually come

25

within the strictures of the statute itself.

If it

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

simply happens to be something that is a matter of the

2

individual’s apparel and is not done in a demonstrating

3

kind of fashion, then it might not come within the —

4

within the -- within the scope of the statute.
QUESTION*

5

That touches, does it not, on

6

another argument raised by the Appellees, which is the

7

argument that the statute is unconstitutionally vague,

8

in any case?
MR. LEE*

9

Yes.

And I think that that one,

10

Justice O'Connor, for reasons that -- I think that that

11

one has been laid to rest by this Court’s decisions over

12

a period of time from Broderick against Oklahoma and

13

culminating with last term's decision in New York versus

14

Ferber.

15

Certainly, the disparity between the clearly

16

prohibitable activity on the one hand and the arguably

17

protected activity on the other in this case is much

18

lesser than it was in New York versus Ferber.

19

read that case, this Court said in very clear terms that

20

what you take into account is the comparison between the

21

legitimate scope, the legitimate sweep of the statute,

22

and the possible impermissible applications.

23

so long as the impermissible is not substantial, then

24

you do not reach the constitutionality of a hypothetical

25

case in the process of deciding the constitutionality of

And as I

And that

12

1

the statute on its face.

2

QUESTIONt

Mr. Solicitor General, is there any

3

other building in this city that has this special

4

protection?

5
6

MR. LEE:
Justice Marshall.

7
8
9

To my knowledge, there is not,

QUESTION:

Well, how do you single this one

out?
MR. LEE:

Because that is in its very nature

10

the kind of judgment that we entrust to legislatures for

11

several reasons as a matter of linedrawing.

12

of the day it is a judicial judgment.

13

said initially in Grayned versus City of Rockford, the

14

question is whether the particular type of expression is

15

compatible with the purpose of the particular place in

16

which it occurs at a particular time.

17

At the end

But as this Court

The inquiry then is whether the expression

18

activity is or is not compatible with the purpose of the

19

particular place.

20

compatibility

to be resolved? At the end of the day

21

is a judicial

decision because it is an issue on which

22

the constitutional holding turns.

Now, how and by whom is this issue of

23

But

it is, I think,

significant in this

24

respect, that

the restriction

in the Cox case, in

25

Grayned, and in Greer, all represented specific

it

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

particularized determinations by the authorized policy

2

makers concerning that issue of compatibility,

3

concerning the compatibility of demonstrations with the

4

particular purposes for which a particular place was

5

intended.
The statute in Cox, for example, dealt

6
7

specifically with picketing near a courthouse.

That was

8

the legislative determination that was involved in that

9

case.

The anti-noise ordinance in Grayned prohibited

10

disruptive noise on the school ground.

And the

11

regulation in Greer pertained to one particular military

12

reservation.
Now, compare that with Edwards versus South

13
14

Carolina.

15

South Carolina was a breach of the peace statute which

16

contained no legislative judgment concerning whether

17

demonstrations were compatible with the grounds

18

surrounding a legislature.

19

The law allegedly violated in Edwards versus

Now, that is not to say that the legislative

20

determination is conclusive, because it is not.

But

21

neither is it irrelevant.

22

Grayned, a precise statute gives this Court the

23

assurance that the legislature has focused on the First

24

Amendment interests and has determined that other

25

governmental policies compel regulation.

As this Court observed in

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

The reason was best explained, perhaps, by

1

2

Professor Kalven, that in the difficult balancing

3

processes that these cases force upon the Court, it has

4

the benefit of a council of a deliberate, specific, and

5

relevant legislative judgment.

6

underlying Section 13k is likewise deliberate, specific,

7

and relevant, and it is that picketing, demonstrating,

8

and leafletting on the Supreme Court grounds are

9

incompatible with the use to which that particular area

The legislative judgment

10

should be put; specifically, the prevention of the

11

public perception of impropriety in the judicial process.
Let me say just a word about the adequacy of

12
13

alternative channels for communication.

The impact of

14

this statute on the Appellees* legitimate First

15

Amendment interests is really quite minimal.

16

versus Spock the Court upheld a ban on partisan

17

political speeches and demonstrations within a military

18

reservation, observing that the people at Fort Dix could

19

attend political rallies out of uniform and off base.

20

There were other means for the expression of that

21

particular kind of political communication.

In Greer

And similarly, the Keffron opinion stressed

22

23

alternative means and places for the practice of

24

Sancratan, which was the religious objective in that

25

case.

These alternatives did not represent the

15
ALDERSGN REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

demonstrators* first choices, but in each of those cases

2

the place restriction was upheld and in each the

3

disparity between the demonstrators* first choice and

4

the alternative was, if anything, greater than in this

5

case.
All that Section 13k requires is that the

6

7

demonstrators move not off the — off base and out of

8

uniform, many miles away, but 20 feet farther away,

9

clearly a lesser spatial sacrifice than was involved

10

either in Greer or Heffron.
QDESTIONi

11
12

And this illustrates —

Well, those people couldn't have

come in here and talked to us.
MR. LEE;

13

Well, even the Court of Appeals and

14

QUESTION;

15
16

I am not talking about the Court of

Appeals, I am talking about my own opinion.
MR. LEE;

17

Well, of course.

It — this statute

18

has nothing to do with voluntary conversations that

19

members of the Court might choose to have with any

20

person.

21
22

QUESTION;

I also would not go to one of their

meetings, either, I give you my word.

23

MR. LEE;

I understand.

24

The narrowness of the disagreement between our

25

position and that of the Appellees demonstrates that the

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

final matter is really one of linedrawing, that it is

2

the kind of linedrawing that lies within the

3

congressional objective, and that if in the interest of

4

preserving the appearance of military propriety, which

5

was one of the objectives that was upheld in Greer

6

versus Spock, is proper, then certainly a congressional

7

objective should be similarly upheld.

8

QUESTIONS

9

MR. LEE.-

10

QUESTION*

11

MR. LEE*

12

QUESTION;

Mr. Solicitor General —
Yes.
— may I ask one other question —
Yes.
-- on this appearance point?

In

13

your jurisdictional statement you pointed out that the

14

disqualification statute provides that we should not sit

15

in a case in which our impartiality might reasonably be

16

questioned.

17

suggested that that statute might apply to at least some

18

members of the Court — I wonder if you have anything

19

further to say on that subject other than what you have

20

said on it.

21

And I wonder -- and the other side has

MR. LEE;

Only this. Justice Stevens — I

22

guess two things.

One is, we know of no reason why any

23

member of the Court should be recused.

24

there is no closer interest of any member of the Court

25

that is involved in this case than would be involved in

In our view,

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

a case concerning the Court’s jurisdiction, the kind of

2

issue that the Court is called upon to pass on with some

3

frequency; and secondly, that the strong congressional

4

policy reflected in 28 U.S.C. Section 1252, that the

5

constitutionality of congressional statutes be decided

6

by this Court should counsel against disqualification.

7

And for that reason, we know of no reason that any

8

member of the Court should be disqualified.

I would like to reserve the rest of my time
for rebuttal.

15

ON BEHALF OF MARY T., GRACE, ET AL., APPELLEES

16
17

MR. GRABERx

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courtx

18

The issue in this case is whether pristine

19

First Amendment activity may be absolutely forbidden

20

anywhere on the grounds of this Court despite the fact

21

that such expression is not basically incompatible with

22

the normal uses of the sidewalk that surrounds the

23

Court, and despite the fact that the manner of

24

expression in which my clients were engaged -- that is,

25

dissemination of printed matter — is allowed on the

2

the Washington Post is allowed to disseminate its

3

particular views through its newspaper.
And we submit that the statute at issue is

4
5

totally unnecessary to preserve the integrity of this

6

Court and that Congress has specifically addressed the

7

concerns of the appearance of justice when it

8

promulgated 1507 and made a specific and considered

9

legislative judgment which is reflected in the

10

legislative history of 1507, that upon a balancing of

11

interests certain speech could be prohibited; namely,

12

speech which is directed toward influencing the Court.

13

And we submit, as the Court of Appeals found, that

14

amply protects the appearance of justice interests.

15

Moreover, we would point out that Section

1507

13k

16

was not passed by Congress, at least as reflected in the

17

legislative history, based on the assumption that some

18

protection was needed beyond that provided by 1507,

fact,

Both statutes were considered by the same

22

Congress, the 81st Congress, in 1949.

However,

23

examination of the legislative histories, which we

24

detail in our briefs, reveals that 13k was really a

25

housekeeping measure that in 1949 for some reason the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

legal counsel to the District of Columbia determined it

2

no longer possessed authority to commission special

3

officers to police this Court.

4

marshal of this Court went into conference with the

5

Court and consulted apparently with legislative counsel

6

to the House of Representatives, and the legislative

7

scheme which was modeled after the scheme applying to

8

the Capitol was enacted.

9

At that time, the

And 13k virtually identically tracks the

10

language of the Capitol statute, 193g, which was

11

invalidated as being spatially unconstitutional in the

12

Jeannette Rankin case.

13

Now, Mr. Lee has pointed out that the test

14

articulated by this Court in Grayned should be applied

15

to this case.

16

whether the manner of expression is basically

17

incompatible with the basic and normal use of the area

18

in which the expression takes place.

19

And we agree with that.

And that test is

And we respectfully submit that a lone

20

leafletter or a lone sign holder who is expressing their

21

views on this Court in a peacable, silent, and orderly

22

manner is not doing something that is basically

23

incompatible with the normal use of the sidewalk.

24
25

Now, the government would have the Court hold
that the grounds of the Court are more akin to a

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

2

than the public sidewalk that it actually is.

3

Court I am sure is aware, there is a bus stop outside

4

and tourists come to the Court.

5

basically like any other sidewalk save for the fact that

6

it borders this Court.

7

As the

The sidewalk is

Sow, the government also states that this is a

8

time, place, and manner restriction.

However, as Mr.

9

Justice Fehnquist I believe pointed out, it is difficult

10

to categorize this statute as a time, place, and manner

11

restriction, since it totally forbids any expressive

12

activity on the grounds of this Court.

13

Now, in Heffron the Court held that the

14

statute at issue was the time, place, and manner

15

restriction, pointed out that the members of the Krishna

16

sect were not totally forbidden from reaching their

17

intended audience but rather, like all other commercial

18

and other enterprises at the state fair, were confined

19

to a particular area on the state fair grounds and in an

20

area where the public was expected to pass.

21

Moreover, the Court noted that members of the

22

Krishna sect were free to walk around the court —

23

excuse me, the state fair grounds and orally proselytize

24

their view without restriction.

MR. GRABER*

Because the statute is not, we

submit, subject to a limiting construction, both because

of its vagueness -- namely, the time to define —

Well, I know, but what — this is a

MR. GRABERs

1

We would certainly accept a

2

limiting construction that would make 13k inapplicable

3

to the sidewalk surrounding the Court, but I submit that

4

the better disposition would be to hold that rather than

5

this Court rewriting the statute, that the marshal is

6

provided under 131 with ample authority to promulgate

7

regulations to preserve the decorum and dignity of this

8

Court.

9

issues in this case would be to —

And the better mechanism for dealing with the

QUESTIOKs

10

Why do you think that’s a better --

11

bettter mechanism than to -- if Congress could just

12

repass the statute and it’s the very same statute but

13

limit it to the steps and the inside of the building,

14

why should we send it back to Congress and make them do

15

that?

MR. GRABERi

QUESTIONS

The basic reason —
Because all — all they’d do is say

— say the statute is unconstitutional as it might be

applied to the sidewalks.
MR. GRABERs

The basic reason, Your Honor, is

21

that I don’t believe this Court’s function is to rewrite

22

statutes.

overbreadth doctrine is an invention of this Court.

it?

5

And that's normally what

And it's — it's just a judicial invention to

MR. GRABER:

Yes.

Well, as I say, we would

have little problem if the Court held that 13k cannot be

applied to the sidewalk.

That achieves the result which

9

QUESTION*

But you want more than that.

ME. GRABER;

10

Well, I think the first part of

11

this statute presents a prohibition against assemblages

12

and processions, no matter the purpose.

13

McKinnon, dissenting in the court below, when he

14

analyzed the statute, also pointed out that the first

15

part of the statute — and the statute as the Court

16

knows, is written in the disjunctive — prohibits

17

processions and assemblages without mentioning the

18

purpose.

19

And Judge

And then the second aspect of the statute goes

20

into prohibiting expressive activity.

And the first

21

part of the statute is so absurdly vague and overbroad

22

that we would submit that that — if the Court was to

23

place the limiting construction, it should also make

24

clear that the first part of the statute is

25

unconstitutionally overbroad.

1

May I ask, Mr. Graber, what

2

standing do you have to quarrel with the first part of

the statute?

Your client didn’t violate that, did he?

But none of the incidents in the

record would violate the first part of the statute.

That’s correct.
In fact, I wonder if they violate

11

the second part of the statute.

MR. GRABER»

13

QUESTION*

I do, too.
Did you — did you take the

14

position in the lower court that you didn’t even violate

15

the statute?

16

MR. GRABER:

Well, in fact. Judge Oberdorfer,

17

the District Court Judge, pointed out in his opinion

18

that he did not feel that our client's conduct was —

19
20

21

22

QUESTION:

Well, then how do we even get to a

constitutional question?
MR. GRABER*

Because the marshal's

interpretation of the statute is that it does —

the face of the statute that your clients didn’t violate

2

it, why do we have to have a major constitutional case

3

out of a very petty dispute?
MR. GRABER:

Because the fact of the matter is

5

that when my clients are outside on the Court sidewalk,

6

the marshal has told them they have to leave and —
QUESTION*

7

You then went into a District Court

8

and said he shouldn't do this, and the Judge could have

said, you’re absolutely right, but he didn't have to

decide any constitutional question, did he?
MR. GRABER*

11
12

No, but if the marshal and the

Supreme Court police are free to apply the statute —

13
14

\

Well, they're not if they obey the

District Court order that tells them not to.
MR. GRABER*

15

Well, the Superior Court placed a

limiting construction on the statute, limiting it to the

17

intent to influence.
QUESTION;

18

And when Mr. Zywicki —
No, but I am leaving out the intent

19

to influence.

I don’t see under the plain language of

20

the statute how your client violated either of the two

clauses.

didn't use a flag, banner, or device designed to bring

into public notice any party, organization, or movement.

Well, but can some stranger come in

and just say, I want to have a statute held

unconstitutional even though I didn’t violate it and

7

there's no basis for prosecuting me under it?
MR. GRABER:

9

Well, Your Honor, after being

threatened with arrest repeatedly, we believe that our

doctrine to attack the statute on its face as applied to

persons whose situations are not before the Court as

MR. GRABERi

quite to the contrary, much broader than Section 1507.

discrimination in determining whether or not particular

demonstrators or leafletters are attempting to influence

However,

concerns that are quite different to a public sidewalk

QUESTION*

Well, but this isn't just a branch

10

of the national government.

Except that. Your Honor, when

James Hadison introduced the First Amendment to the

And Congress rejected that view and broadened it to

include the government, which does include all three

someone picked up under this statute and charged under

this statute?
MR. GRABER:

4

Well, I — then the statute could

be attacked on the grounds on which we are submitting,

6

and the prosecution in that case would have chosen the

7

wrong statute in which to prosecute the individual.
Unless there are any further questions by the

8
9

Court, in conclusion we would simply submit that this

10

statute was not based on considered judgments of

11

Congress that the First Amendment may be absolutely

12

rendered inapplicable to this Court; rather, the statute

13

was passed along with the other scheme of which 13k is a

You don't contend that violates the

QUESTION*

5

Yes, because —
What part of the statute does that

violate?
HR. GRABER*

6

It is a device, the vending

7

machine is a device designed or adapted to bring into

8

public notice an organization; namely, the Washington

9

Post.

And every day when the person from the Post comes

10

and puts in their newspaper, as the government conceded

11

in the District Court, that statute is being violated.

How about the Pepsi Cola delivery

truck at the back?

19

HR. GRABER;

That is another problem.

You can’t be serious.

Your Honor, I did not write this

20

statute.

21

any device designed or adapted to bring into notice any

22

organization, movement, or party.

23

But the literal terms of the statute prohibit

QUESTION*

Oh, but a court construing any

24

statute under — in any jurisdiction tries to construe

25

it with some notion as to what the evils the legislature

intended and what a common-sense construction of the

2

statute would result in.

3

the language, but I can't believe that the Pepsi Cola

4

truck or the Washington Post circulation man really are

5

violating the statute.

6

MR. GRABERs

There may be close cases under

Well, the fact of the matter is

through the printed word its views --

Well -Well, who paid your clients?
Nobody.
Well, that's the difference.
Also —
This is in a very different theory

19

of why the Post would violate the statute now.

20

saying — you're abandoning your suggestion just because

21

the sign that says "Washington Post" on the vending

22

machine, that doesn't — that's really pretty far out.

23

And that would make the sign, I suppose, on the men's

24

room violate the statute.

MR. GRABER:

You're

No.

(Laughter. )

2

MR. GRA8ER:

It is a different theory, the

3

theory being that once the forum is open to a particular

4

medium of expression, then the government is

5

hard-pressed to justify closing it to the same medium of

6

expression.
QOESTION;

Well, but I am asking you why, why

it violates the statute.

I am not asking about the
And you have another theory

10

on the Post other than the fact they have their sign on

11

the vending machine?
MR. GRABERi.

12

Yes.

That is that the — whoever

13

has allowed dissemination through printed matter to the

Post and also met forum but is depriving my clients of

their rights.

moment.

statute by being sold within the building or wherever it

19

is sold?

20

How does the Post violate the language of this

MR. GRABERs

Well, the Post itself, because of

21

the ambiguity of the term "device," the Post itself may

22

be a device which with its banner contains a reference

23

to the organization of the Washington Post.

24

Okay.

I understand.

Mr. Graber, is it agreed by both

ORAL ARGUMENT BY REX E. LEE, ESQ.,

13

ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, ET AL.,
APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL

14
15

MR. LEE;

First, with regard to the most

16

recent exchange between Mr. Graber and the Court, I

17

think that what that illustrates is the wisdom of two

18

messages that I see emanating from this Court's opinion

19

in New York versus Berber that came down last term.

20

those two messages are that where you have a statute

21

that is attacked as being either overbroad or vague,

22

that the first thing you look for is to see if there

23

isn 't some way that a common-sense narrowing

24

interpretation of the statute can't save its

25

constitutionality.

And

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

That is particularly appropriate in this

1
2

instance, because unlike the statute in Broderick and in

3

New York, this is a congressional statute, and therefore

4

the interpretative stewardship lies within this Court

5

itself.
QUESTION;

these people violated the statute?

QUESTION*

It's certainly difficult for me to

identify the party, organization, or movement that that

18

sign — that that sign brings into public notice.

19

MR. LEE*

Let me say two things.

One is that

20

I think, we should give at least something that

21

approaches the deference to administrative agencies who

22

are charged with the responsibility of interpreting the

23

statutes, the judgment, the interpretation that is given

24

to it by the marshal.

25

neither is it — is it totally irrelevant.

Certainly, it’s not binding, but
And the

41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

marshal has interpreted this statute as prohibiting

2

generally picketing-type activity.

3

picketing-type activity certainly does include the

4

carrying of a sign.

And the

The second message that comes out of this

5
6

Court’s holding in New York versus Ferber is that

7

because you can find one isolated element of

8

unconstitutionality, that you don’t throw out the — the

9

entire statute.

Therefore, both the construction

10

alternative and also the on-its-face approach as opposed

11

to the -- or excuse me, the as-applied approach as

12

opposed to the on-its-face approach are two messages

13

that come clearly from this Court’s decision of last

14

year in New York versus Ferber.
Now, finally, as to whether this really is

15
16

just a place restriction, Mr. Graber expresses the view

17

that it totally forbids expressive activity.

18

clearly is his view.

19

interpret the statute, because of his example including

20

everything from the Washington Post to the Pepsi Cola

21

truck.

22

And that

That is the way that he would

The point of the matter is that is not the

23

purpose of the statute, it is not the way the marshal

24

has interpreted it, and this Court's opinions clearly

25

teach that you don't interpret the statute in such a way

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that is to be unconstitutional.

The purpose of

2

interpretation is to save rather than to condemn.
As a statute that prohibits picketing-type

3
4

activities, demonstration kinds of activities, it is a

5

statute that falls squarely within the ambit of what

6

this Court has held in Greer versus Spock, Heffron, and

7

the other cases.

8

activity? namely, the picket sign, the leafletting, the

9

parading.

It forbids only one kind of expressive

Just as the Court said, one of the basics for

10

the Court’s holding in Greer versus Spock was that the

11

kind of political activity that was involved in that

12

case might create, and I am quoting, "the appearance

13

that the military was acting as a handmaiden for

14

partisan political causes or candidates."

15

If the preservation of military appearances

16

justifies a place limitation on demonstrations, then we

17

submit that a fortiori a congressional judgment

18

affecting a much smaller place in the interest of

19

preserving public confidence in the judiciary should

20

also be upheld.

21

And now, finally, aside from all other

22

considerations, it should lie within the lagitimate

23

authority of Congress to identify a limited number of

24

places which serve as symbols of certain congressionally

25

determined national values.

And where necessary to the

43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

achievement of those symbolic purposes. Congress may

2

further determine that those few places are to enjoy a

3

special environment free of the picketer and free of his

4

signs.

5

And if Congress wants to take special steps to

6

prevent the grounds of this Court from becoming another

7

Hyde Park or even a Lafayette Park, in symbolism of the

8

dignity anl decorum and total judicial values that are

9

represented by this Court, not only as representative of

10

its own work but also the work of the entire federal

11

judiciary, then that, we submit, lies within the

12

legitimate prerogative of Congress so long as it is

13

content-neutral, and this one clearly is, and so long as

14

there are adequate alternative channels for

15

communication, and clearly there are.

16
17

For this reason, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals should be reversed.
