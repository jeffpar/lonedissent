ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE T. FRAMPTON, JR., ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. FRAMPTONi

Kr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, this case involves the

10

constitutionality of Ohio's early filing deadline for

11

independent candidates as that provision is applied to

12

independent Presidential candidates.

13

The statute reguires all independent

14

candidates seeking ballot access in November to file a

15

declaration of candidacy and 5,000 petition signatures

16

of Ohio registered voters at least 75 days before Ohio's

17

early June primary, which in 1980 was March 20th.

18

Primary partisan candidates seeking to run in the

19

primaries, party primaries, also must file by this same

20

date, but partisan Presidential candidates need not file

21

for or run in Ohio's Presidential primaries in order to

22

get on the ballot in November.

23

Under Ohio law, both minor party and major

24

party candidates, if selected by their parties some time

25

before late August, will appear on Ohio's ballot

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

regardless of whether those candidates were declared

2

candidates in .’'arch or April or Hay, regardless of

3

whether they ran in Ohio's primary or any other primary,

4

regardless of whether they came into Ohio or did

5

anything in Ohio prior to August.
Now, in the winter and spring of

6

1980 ,

7

Congressman John Anderson was a Republican candidate for

8

the nomination of the Republican Party as President of

9

the United States.

When it became clear that his

10

support was coming not so much from Republican Party

11

regulars as from more or less equally Republicans,

12

Democrats, and independents, on April 24, 1980, he

13

announced that he was abandoning his Republican quest

14

and would seek to become an independent candidate

15

nationwide.
QUESTION;

16
17

the filing deadline?

18
19

20

This was about 30 days or so after

HR. FRAHPT0N;

That’s correct, Mr. Chief

That same day,

April 24, he also notified the

Justice.

21

Respondent in this case, the Secretary of State, that he

22

was timely withdrawing from the Republican primary in

23

Ohio, in which he was entered, and the state has

24

stipulated and conceded from the beginning of this

25

lawsuit that Anderson's timely withdrawal from the

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Republican primary in Ohio means that he was not barred

2

from getting on the general election ballot by Ohio's

3

so-called sore loser statute.

4

QUESTIONS

Do you think, it makes any

5

difference that he had filed once under a party

6

designation and then sought to file later as a third

7

party candidate?

8

9

MR. FRAMPTON:

In this case, Mr. Chief

Justice, I don’t think it makes any difference, because

10

the Ohio legislature has already made a judgment about

11

whether that would disqualify a person in Mr. Anderson's

12

position from getting on the general election ballot.

13

That judgment is reflected in its sore loser statute,

14

3513.04, which provides in substance that someone who

15

loses the primary, party primary, cannot thereafter run

16

as an independent, and in a specific withdrawal statute

17

providing -- that applies specifically to Presidential

18

primary candidates, that holds that a Presidential

19

candidate who withdraws from a Presidential primary is

20

entitled to do that within 30 days of the party primary,

21

which would be early May, and the state has stipulated

22

that by virtue of that timely withdrawal, the sore loser

23

ban didn't apply to him.

24

After this notification on April —

25

QUESTION:

Yes, but that person would have had

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to have filed or made his intentions to run in the

2

primary Known tefore his withdrawal.

3

withdraw if he wasn’t running.

He couldn’t

4

MS. FRAMPTON;

That's correct, Justice White.

5

I think the point is- that the sore loser

6

statute, that is, the statute that directs itself to the

7

question of whether a candidate has previously sought to

8

gain the party nomination is — expresses a very

9

different state interest than the filing deadline, and

10

the filing deadline is a much more burdensome provision,

11

because it bars all independent candidates and all

12

independent-minded voters after March 20 from putting

13

forward an independent candidate, whereas the sore loser

14

provision applies only to individual candidates, and

15

doesn’t bar the voters from putting forward another

16

independent until some time very late in the summer.

17
18

QUESTION;

Mr. Frampton, exactly what is the

First Amendment right beina asserted here?

19

MR. FRAMPT0N;

20

QUESTIONi

21

MR. FRAMPTON;

Justice —

How would you articulate it?
Justice O’Connor,

I think it is

22

directly the First Amendment right of the -- principally

23

being asserted in this case is the right of the voters

24

and citizens, including those petitioners who are Ohio

25

registered voters who are seeking to support Congressman

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 f202l 554-2345

1

Anderson by putting forward his name and having him on

2

the ballot, their right to associate for the purpose of

3

putting their candidate before whatever body the state

4

designates to select its electors in November.
And in addition, I think what this Court has

5
6

recognized in many cases as an intertwined but somewhat

7

separate right to vote which is not found as such in the

8

Constitution, but I think this Court has recognized is

9

fundamental to the democratic process, and is important

10

if any of the rights in the Constitution -QUESTION;

11

12

Does Ohio permit write-in

candidates?
ME. FRAMPTON:

13

Yes, it does, and there is a

14

specific provision in the Ohio code for Presidential

15

candidates.

16

prior to, I believe it is 40 days prior to the general

17

election, you file a slate of electors with state

18

officials.

19
20
21

You can qualify as a write-in candidate if,-

QUESTION;

Well, then, how is the right to

vote infringed?
HR. FRAMPTON;

Justice O'Connor, I think the

22

Court has recognized in the past, for example, in Lubin

23

and Panish, that the write-in -- and in Williams and

24

Rhodes, that the write-in alternative is not an

25

equivalent, a practical equivalent either for voters or

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

for candidates to having a candidate's name on the

2

ballot, and I would contend that that is particularly so

3

for someone seeking as important an office as President

4

of the United States.
I think the reason for that is that the

5
6

write-in alternative and the ballot access alternative

7

serve very different purposes.

8

candidate and to his or her supporters, if you can

9

demonstrata substantial community support, you are

The state is saying to a

10

entitled to have your name printed on the ballot.

11

Perhaps the major party candidates get some ballot

12

preference, but the independent's or third party

13

candidate's name will be on the ballet.
The state is also saying by the write-in

14
15

alternative, we are not going to totally bar everyone

16

else.

17

any community support, we will allow people to write

18

your name in if you simply go through some

19

administrative -- jump through some administrative hoops

20

near to the election.

In other words, regardless of whether you have

21

So they are two very different things.

22

QUESTIONi

23
24
25

Well, you are not relying really on

some right to be a candidate, then.
NR. FRANPTONi

Justice O'Connor, I think we

are certainly asserting the right of Petitioner John

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Anderson to be on the ballot and to represent these

2

people.

3

His rights —
QUESTION;

Bo you think that Clements versus

4

Fashing bears on that, where the Court indicated there

5

wasn't such a right?

6

MR. FRAMPTON;

Justice O'Connor, I think the

7

Court treated that case as principally a case asserting

8

the candidate's rights, and although we do have a

9

candidate here asserting his rights, I think that the

10

principal rights being asserted here are those of the

11

other petitioners and voters and citizens like them.

12

QUESTION;

Well, if we have said there isn't a

13

right under the First Amendment to be a candidate, then

14

can the voters have some right that hinges on some right

15

to be a candidate?

16

MR. FRAMPTON;

I think it does, but I think

17

the voters also have an independent right.

18

rights that are being infringed here are the rights of

19

independents and other voters to have the opportunity

20

during this five-month period when party supporters have

21

an opportunity to react to political events and other

22

candidates' choices, and in late August to be able to

23

choose that candidate who is going to have the best

24

chance to win.

25

The voters'

It is the discrimination between the rights of

very theoretical, but I thi nk that you can take any of

4

the examples that we have c ited in our brief from

Yes, but the logic of

your position

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

suggests that if the major party conventions were held

2

in late August and September, and the candidates

3

nominated only then, and although that isn’t the

4

tradition, there is certainly nothing in the law that

5

prevents it, your people would still have a right after

6

that happens, however late or however few days left

7

before election, your people would still have a right to

8

act after the major parties in order to put their

9

candidate up, and I don't see where you get that out of

10

our cases.
MR. FRAMPTONi

11

Justice Rehnguist, I don't

think that is at all the necessary logic of our

13

position.

14

not be permitted to very substantially burden and

15

discriminate against independents by making them qualify

16

much earlier than the party candidates absent some state

17

interest that the legislature, state legislature has

18

considered and made a determined judgment it is really

19

necessary to impose this burden.

20

Our position is only that the state should

For example, administrative interests of the

21

state of Ohio on the face of its statute might well

22

sustain a filing deadline here in early June, several

23

months in advance of the party conventions, and indeed

24

this Court has sustained mid-June deadlines.

25

So we are not arguing that independents have

process that lasts, let's say, from January to August,

throughout the country, in 50 states, in which the

I would like to point out that the court of

11
12

appeals here which reversed the district court appears

13

to have held that a very lenient standard of review is

14

appropriate.

15

decisions of this Court mandate strict scrutiny in this

16

case, we think that even with the most lenient standard

17

of review, that the statute doesn't pass constitutional

18

muster .

Although it is our position that the

QUESTION;

Well, in that regard, Hr. Frampton,

20

are you suggesting that without regard to how this

21

statute was applied to Hr. Anderson and his supporters,

22

the statute is unconstitutional on its face?

23

your position?

24
25

HP. FRAHPTON:

Is that

It is our position that it is

unconstitutional on its face as applied to the

13

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

Presidential race.
QUESTION;

Well, how about as it is applied to

3

Congressman Anderson, in the particular circumstances of

4

his case, and if you say that — if you — let's just

5

assume that as applied in this case, it was

6

constitutionally applied.

7

your position is nevertheless the statute should be

8

declared unconstitutional on its face because it might

9

be applied unconstitutionally in other circumstances.

10

MR. FRAhPTCN:

Just assume that.

I take it

The assumption that the statute

11

— that — the assumption would be that Congressman

12

Anderson could constitutionally be barred from Ohio's

13

general election.

14

QUESTION:

Yes, yes, the very case that the

15

statute was not unconstitutionally applied to him.

16

Assume that.

17

MR. FRAMPTONi

But it seems -- sorry.

It

18

seems to me that assumption would be that the state

19

could have passed some other law, such as a

20

disaffiliation provision, that would have barred it.

21

QUESTION:

Well, that may be so, but what

22

about this law?

23

unconstitutional on its face?

24
25

It would nevertheless be

MR. FRAMPTON:

Well, our position, I think,

then -- my answer has to be twofold.

One, this isn't a

14

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

disaffiliation provision.

2

stability device.

3

entitled to make it into something that it isn't.

4

then, third, that --

5

QUESTION;

It is not a political

And second, that the state isn't
And

Yes, but why would you -- why would

6

you -- why would you think you were entitled to have it

7

declared unconstitutional on its face, just because it

8

might be applied to others in an unconstitutional way?

9

HR. FRAMPTON;

Well, I don't -- Mr. Justice, I

10

don't think that is the real thrust of the Court's

11

overbreadth opinions --

12

13
14

QUESTION;

Well,

I want to know what the

thrust of your position is.
MR. FRAMPTON;

If Congressman Anderson, for

15

example, were contesting -- had been faced with an

16

850,000 petition signature requirement in June, which he

17

had challenged because he couldn't get the correct

18

number of signatures, I don't think that it would be

19

right to say that he wasn't entitled to challenge that

20

requirement because the state could have barred him with

21

some kind of political stability device --

22

QUESTION;

I still -- I still want to know

23

whether we should judge this case — we should ask

24

ourselves whether this statute was constitutionally

25

applied to Anderson in the circumstances of this case,

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
4t)0 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

or whether we must also ask, well, that is sort of

2

irrelevant, is the statute unconstitutional on its face,

3

because it is overbroad, or because of something else.

4

MR. FRAHPTON:

That is correct.

Our position

5

has always been that it has to be considered in terms of

6

its impact on its face —

7

QUESTION;

Well, not if the test is just mere

8

rationality.

And you seem to — I know you say it is

9

strict scrutiny, but —

10

MR. FRAMPTON;

Well, our position is that even

11

if a rational relationship test is applied, the statute

12

falls, because it isn’t -- it doesn't in fact rationally

13

further political stability goals.

14

example, prevent a party candidate from running as an

15

independent.

16

the filing deadline or any other provision a person who

17

has been a long-time independent from running in a party

18

primary, or a party member from running in another

19

party's primary, or a candidate from filing as an

20

independent in the Presidential race and going on and

21

continuing to run as a party candidate in every other

22

state in the country.

23

of the political stability purposes that this Court

24

outlined in upholding a one-year disaffiliation clause

25

for state races in Storer.

It doesn't, for

It doesn't -- the state doesn’t prevent by

So it doesn’t in fact serve any

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

So it is just not that kind of device.

It

seems to me that argument has to be premised on the

3

state's position that this isn't really a filing

4

deadline.

5

like.

6

sheep’s clothing.

7

is just a filing deadline.

It is something other than what it looks

It is a sheep in wolf's clothing, or a wolf in
And our position is, it is not.

It

8

If you look at the legislative history, or how

9

the statute operates, or other ways in which you look at

10

a statute that looks like one thing which somebody says

11

is really something else, all of those show you that it

12

isn't something else in disguise, it is just a filing

13

deadline.

14

demonstrate his community support.

Just a date by which a candidate must

In fact, the legislative history shows here,

15
16

if we have to go to that, that at best the statute is an

17

accident.

18

where the state can legitimately say everybody who wants

19

to get on the ballot has got to start out at the same

20

time, and nobody gave much thought to the fact that in

21

the Presidential context it is irrational.

22

It is something designed for statewide races

At worst, it is a leftover part of an

23

exclusionary scheme that this Court recognized in

24

Williams and Rhodes.

25

I think that although a large part of our case

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

does turn on discrimination, that we would have an

2

equally strong case, and do have an equally strong case

3

simply flowing from the burden that the statute imposes

4

on independent candidates even absent the

5

discrimination.

6

No, Your Honor, there is not.

Fven if Ohio had a non-discriminatory statute,

that is, even if we were facina a statute that applied

equally to --

5

QUESTION:

When you say discriminatory, it

6

does, of course, it treats party people and independents

7

differently.

Is that what you mean by discrimination?

8

MR. FRAMPTON;

9

QUESTION;

Yes.

Just that it — you are not

10

suggesting that just because they are treated

11

differently, that the law is unconstitutional?

12

MR. FRAMPTON:

No, we are suggesting that

13

because independent candidates and voters who may wish

14

to put forward some candidates are deprived of the

15

opportunity during most of the time everybody else

16

chooses their nominees from doing the same thing, that

17

that is both an invidious discrimination and a burden*

18

But even if the difference in treatment -- I

19

am sorry — were absent from the case, I think we'd have

20

a strong case.

21

because then the question would be, in the context of a

22

50-state process, where other states, voters in other

23

states are choosing the nominees, could Ohio alone take

24

the position that no candidate who had not thrown his

25

name into the ring as of March 20th was going to get on

It would be a different case to analyze,

Ohio's ballot regardless of who nominated him.
Now, I think if you look at it from that

2

context, that that would be a very, very substantial

burden, a substantial interference by Ohio in the

5

political process nationwide.

QUESTION;

Of course, I think it is also true

7

that the Ohio -- it is inconceivable that the Ohio

ME. FRAMPTON;

10

Absolutely.

I am quite sure

11

that if they did, that I wouldn't be here alone today,

12

that the Republican and Democratic Party voters would be

13

here urging on you the proposition that this was a

14

massive infringement on their rights under Cousins and

15

Wigoda, but we all know that the states aren't going to

16

do that.

17

not going to buck the power of the two major political

18

parties, and all we are saying in this case is, fine,

19

but then the states should not be permitted, having made

20

that choice, to go ahead and just buck the independents

21

who simply because their supporters have chosen not to

22

affiliate with an ongoing political institution between

elections don't have the political organization to go to

were true, I think there would be no difficulty about

19

MR. FRAMPTON;

It seems to me that the Court,

20

although it is not a separate party, of course, the

21

Court has recognized in previous decisions that

22

independent-minded voters, those people who for whatever

23

reason don't want to affiliate themselves with an

24

organized ongoing political faction, do have different

and independent type of rights that are entitled to the

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

15

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL S. TAYLOR, ESQ.,

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

17

MR. TAYLOR:

Nr. Taylor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

18

please the Court, the Ohio filing deadline at issue in

19

this case has a burden, if it has one at all, of an

20

entirely different character than the election

21

regulations that have been struck down in the past by

22

this Court.

23

independent candidacies from the Ohio ballot, nor does

24

it make it virtually impossible for third party

25

candidacies, as was the case in Williams v. Rhodes, nor

It does not result in a prohibition of all

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON D C, 20094 <2021 554-2345

1

does this filing deadline result in any class of voters

2

being totally prohibited from voting at all, as was the

3

case in Dunn against Blumstein, the Tennessee one-year

4

residency case, and Kramer against Union Free School

5

District, where classes of voters were prohibited from

6

voting at all in a particular election.

7

The burden of this statute is indeed even less

8

than the burden posed by statutes which have been upheld

9

by this Court.

For example, this filing deadline does

10

not require the voter to make up his mind as long as

11

eleven months before an election how he wishes to

12

participate in that election, as was the case in Posario

13

against Rockefeller, in which a party enrollment statute

14

in New York was upheld that required enrollment as long

15

as eleven months before a primary election.

16

Nor does this statute require the candidate to

17

make up his mind as to how he wishes to participate in

18

an election as long as one year before that election, as

19

was the case in Storer v. Rhodes, in which a one-year

20

disaffiliation requirement was upheld.

21

Indeed, all this statute requires is that a

22

person seeking the office of President, an office for

23

which the campaigns frequently begin as long as two

24

years before the election, make up his mind seven and a

25

half months before that election that he wishes to seek

This, I would

I would like to stress three areas in my

3
4

argument.

Number one, that there is no invidious

5

discrimination in this case between independent

6

candidates and the candidates of political parties.

7

Number two, the statute does not pose a substantial

8

burden upon any constitutional rights for the class of

9

independent candidates, and therefore strict scrutiny is

10

not appropriate.

And Number three, it is in fact

11

supported by important state interests.
QUESTION;

12

On your second point, do you say

13

the same thing about not only the candidate but about

14

his supporters?
MR. TAYLOR;

15

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

Of

16

course, any candidate restriction is going to have some

17

kind of an effect on voters, and I think —
QUESTION;

18

I take it your opposition stresses

19

the associat ional right rather than the candidate’s

20

right.

21

MR. TAYLOR;

Right.

The -- Any restriction on

22

a candidacy is going to have an effect on voters to the

23

extent that if the candidate does not comply with that

24

restriction, whatever it is, then his supporters will

25

have one less candidate available to vote for.

In other

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

words, any candidate restriction is goina to narrow the

2

field to some extent that the voter has available to him.
The Court has never held that that simple

3
4

narrowing of the field all by itself is enough to

5

establish an infringement of rights.

6

v. Carter which -- in which the issue was discussed

7

extensively, the Court in that case relied upon a

factual determination that indeed many, many candidates

conclusion that the regulation must be justified by a

QUESTION;

Well, there may be a threshold

4

inquiry of whether it is an undue burden or something of

5

that kind.

6

MR. TAYLOR;

Indeed, I think that is the case.

7

Justice O’Connor, and in several cases the Court has

8

done exactly that.

9

11

actually a remand made to the lower courts for the

13

whether that regulation was indeed burdensome.

14

16
17

QUESTION;

Does any other state have a filing

deadline as early as Ohio's?
HR. TAYLOR;

One state currently has a filing

deadline earlier than Ohio.

18

QUESTION;

What is that?

19

HR. TAYLOR;

20

QUESTION;

21

HR. TAYLOR;

I believe that is Indiana.
Indiana?
New Jersey, I believe, has one in

22

April, and there were, of course, at one time filing

23

deadlines in four other states at or about the same time

24

as Ohio's that were struck down as a result of Anderson

25

litigation in other cases.

So that it would appear that

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

at least seven states are desirous of having a filing

2

deadline at or about this time.

3

many

4

come much earlier than the second of the two national

5

conventions.

There are, of course,

other filing deadlines in June and July that would

And I think indeed that Petitioners' position

6
7

does — would in fact require, if sustained, the

8

invalidating of filing deadlines that came in advance of

9

the national conventions, because as I understand his

10

argument, it is clearly that the voters have a right to

11

coalesce around an independent candidate after the

12

issues have been determined at the convention, and after

13

the identities of the major parties' nominees are known.
So that I think the impact of this case would

14
15

be much, much broader than simply a filing deadline that

16

occurs in the spring.

17

Turning to the question of whether there is

18

invidious discrimination in this case, the Petitioner

19

argues that the discrimination to exist simply because

20

the independent candidate must file his petitions in

21

March, whereas the political parties remain free to

22

select their nominee up until as late as the conventions

23

in August.
There is a fundamental fallacy in making this

24
25

argument.

There is an assumption that is not merited

and the political party is simply that the political

fundamental nature of the differences between political

The independent candidacy is a candidacy by

independent candidate that there was invidious

discrimination because he did in fact have to file his

the political party candidate could qualify by winning

7

The Court in rejecting that claim indicated

8

that these were simply two different types of

procedures, and that it is not possible to compare

10

political parties and independent candidates for all

purposes, and indeed, that the grossest discrimination

12

can sometimes lie in treating things that are different

13

as though they were the same.

14

And with respect to the Fourteenth Amendment

not appropriate to compare those two very different

assuming that one can make an attempt to compare the

Returning to the question of whether we are

independent candidates equally, the burden at the point

MR. TAYLOR;

So it

There is no evidence in the

record of this case, and the Petitioner produced none,

10

to show that we have ever had that kind of a problem

11

with the Ohio filing deadline, and we would indeed

12

submit, and the Sixth Circuit, I think, found that the

13

most likely impact of this filing deadline is with

14

respect to a candidate such as Anderson, who had no

15

trouble at all making up his mind that he wanted to seek

16

the Presidency, but simply wished to switch horses in

17

the middle of the stream.

As a factual matter, there is simply no

QUESTION;

You only need one case, don’t you,

That's correct.

Your five minor party candidates

That's correct. Justice Stevens,

17

but I think if we look at the situation that the

18

political party voter finds himself in in August, at the

19

time of his conventions, we find it is not really any

20

different than the voter for the independent candidate.

21

Let's assume, for example, at the time of the

22

convention that a substantial block of persons within a

23

major political party is dissatisfied with all the

24

candidates that have been produced through the primaries

25

and the conventions, and would like — they don't want

41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

to bolt the party, but they would like to coalesce

2

around a different candidate within the party.

3

Well, they are under the same kind of

4

disability that the independent candidate is.

5

of candidates is narrowed in the spring.

6

QUESTIONj

That is not a big disability

7

imposed by your state statute.

8

imposed by party problems.

9

The field

HR. TAYLOR;

That is a disability

But I think it is fair to view

10

our statute in the context of the way the Presidential

11

election occurs in this country, and indeed, that is

12

critical to an understanding of this alternative equal

13

protection argument, because there has been a

14

fundamental change in the method of selection of the

15

Presidential candidates that occurred just prior to the

16

time that Ohio adopted this filing deadline.

17

The political commentators who have written on

18

this subject in the last two or three years, and we cite

19

six of them on Page 28 of our brief, are unanimous in

20

their declaration that a fundamental change occurred

21

after the 1968 Presidential election such that we

22

switched from basically a brokered convention system to

23

a system that results in the nominees of the parties

24

being selected through the primaries.

25

And those commentators are unanimous in their

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

view that any party candidate who wishes to seek the

2

nomination, if he is serious about it at all, has to go

3

after it in this day and age in the primary, and that

4

means in turn that the candidate has to be seeking

5

delegates to the convention through the primary election

6

system, so that the party candidates in Ohio are going

7

to be in there filing their petitions and making their

8

decision to go for office at the same time as the

9

independent candidate.

10

I think it is a myth to talk about candidates

11

arising as late as August with one possible exception,

12

and that is if you've got an extreme situation like the

13

death of a candidate or a sudden withdrawal, but most of

14

the time, indeed probably more than 90 percent of the

15

time, we are going to have a situation where the people

16

that want this -- the office of President are in there

17

at the same time in Ohio fighting for it.

18

QUESTION:

Well, really, all you are arguing

19

is that this doesn't happen very often, but the question

20

is, when it happens, what is the state interest in

21

justifying refusing to let this large group of people

22

vote for the person they want to vote for?

23

HR. TAYLOR:

We have -- We are asserting

24

basically three interests in having what we view as a

25

simultaneous filing deadline for party candidates and

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

2

promotes the equal treatment of those candidates.

3

interest that the Sixth Circuit in this case discussed

4

most extensively was the interest in what it called

5

voter education, and the — having those joint filing

6

deadlines serves that interest in this way.

7

Presidential campaigns have begun earlier and earlier,

8

if anything, in recent years, and we find the voters

9

buffeted by exploratory committees, and rumors, and it

The first is that we think, it

is a confused situation.
The requirement that those persons who are

serious about pursuing that nomination in Ohio file

are really serves, I think., a couple of different voter

education interests.

basically puts the voter in the position of

understanding what his options are in the spring.
