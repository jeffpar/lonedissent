may it please the Court.
This is a criminal case involving the

Thank, you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

application to the particular facts of this case of

10

Section 5021(b) of the Federal Youth Corrections Act of

11

1950 and Section 3204 Chapter 22 of the District of

12

Columbia Code, in particular a provision of that section

13

multiplying by a factor of ten the penalty for repeat

14

offenders.

15

and 3 of petitioner’s brief.

16

These provisions are set forth at pages 2

Th question before the Court is*

Whether

17

petitioner may be sentenced as a recidivist under

18

Section 3204 based on a conviction for which he served a

19

sentence of 2 years of probation pursuant to Section

20

5010(a) of the Federal Youth Corrections Act and was

21

granted an unconditional discharge.

22

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals which

23

answered a similar question in the negative is in

24

conflict with the District of Columbia .Court of Appeals,

25

the court below, which answered this question in the

Petitioner maintains that the District of

2
3

Columbia Court of Appeals is in error and that his

4

sentencing as a recidivist was improper for two

5

independent reasons!

6

Youth Corrections Act conviction was set aside pursuant

7

to Section 5021(b) when he received his unconditional

8

discharge; and number two, whether or not it was

technically set aside pursuant to Section 5021, it is

Number one, his earlier Federal

10

not a proper basis upon which to impose a recidivist

11

penalty under Section 3204.
The facts are not in dispute.

12

On February 12,

13

1971, petitioner, then 19 years of age, entered a plea

14

of guilty in the District of Columbia Court of General

15

Sessions to the charge of carrying a pistol without a

16

license, in violation of 22 D.C. Code Section 3204.
The imposition of sentence was suspended, and

17

petitioner was placed on probation under Section 5010(a)

19

of the Federal Youth Corrections Act for a period of 2

20

years.

procedures, petitioner's term of probation was allowed

22

to expire without judicial attention to the question of

23

whether or not he should have been discharged prior to

24

the end of his two-year term.

25

Contrary to established Probation Department

At the end of his term in 1973 petitioner was

filed charging petitioner with assault with a dangerous

weapon, a stick, and carrying a pistol without a

license, after having been previously convicted of

carrying an unlicensed pistol.

allegedly committed on November 23, 1979.

Both offenses were

Prior to petitioner's trial, the government

10
11

informed the Court below, pursuant to D.C. law, that

12

petitioner had previously been convicted of carrying a

13

pistol without a license and was therefore subject to

14

the increased recidivist penalty provided by Section

15

3204.

petitioner had been sentenced under the Federal Youth

20

not guilty of assault with a stick but guilty of

Petitioner appealed his sentence as contrary

3

to Section 5021(b) of the Youth Act and of the

4

construction placed on that section by the Fifth Circuit

5

Court of Appeals in United States versus Arrington.

6

However, the District of Columbia Court of

7

Appeals affirmed.

It found Arrington to be based on

8

unpersuasive authority and held that under Section

9

5021(b) only those youth offenders who are

10

unconditionally discharged by a court prior to

11

completing a Youth Act probationary sentence are

12

entitled to have their convictions set aside.

13

concluded that a conviction which was not set aside was

14

a proper basis for the recidivist sentence that

15

petitioner received.

16

The Court

On October 12, 1982, this Court granted a

17

petition for writ of certiorari to review the decision

18

of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.

19

The gist of petitioner’s argument is that the

20

use of his 1971 Federal Youth Act conviction to trigger

21

the felony recidivist penalty contained in Section 3204

22

of the District of Columbia Code was improper on two

23

independent grounds:

24

been automatically set aside pursuant to Section 5021(b)

25

by petitioner’s unconditional discharge from probation;

first, the 1971 conviction had

and second, whether or not it was technically set aside,

2

it may not properly be used to trigger a recidivist

3

penalty.

I would —
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER s

Ms. Stuntz, would your

5

second ground require us to interpret differently than

6

did the D.C. Court of Appeals a statute dealing

7

primarily with local matters in the Distrct?

8
9

MS. STUNTZ*

Mr. Justice, the District of

Columbia Court of Appeals, as I understand its treatment

10

of that issue, which was very perfunctory, felt it was

11

not a matter for its determination as a court, but that

12

the issue was better addressed to Congress.

13
14
15

QUESTION*

Well, that's one way of telling you

that you lose, I suppose.
MS. STUNTZ*

I do not think there would be

16

involved any alteration of their interpretation.

17

did not approach the question that fully.

18
19

20

QUESTION:

They

Is it an independent state ground

for decision?
MS. STUNTZ:

Your Honor, since it — since

21

this question involves the interrelationship of both

22

statutes, it would be petitioner's position that there

23

would — could be no independent state ground since it

24

necessarily involves the construction o_f both the

25

Federal Youth Corrections Act and the District of

1

Columbia provision.

2

QUESTION*

But supposing this case had come to

3

us from New York or Illinois and the state court had

4

said, we are going to treat the Federal Youth

5

Corrections Act as a proper basis for a state recidivist

6

penalty.

7

ground, wouldn’t it?

8

this Court did?

9

Now, that would clearly be an adequate state
And isn’t that pretty much what

MS. STUNTZi

To the extent that that

10

interpretation of the Federal Youth Corrections Act,

11

which is plainly a matter for this Court's purview,

12

differed with a matter of this Court's interpretation, I

13

should think it would not be an adequate State ground.

14

QUESTION;

Do you think we could prevent a

15

State court from treating a Youth Corrections Act

16

conviction as a basis for its own recidivist statute?

17

Couldn’t New York pass a statute that says a second

18

conviction will result in an enhanced penalty and we

19

shall for this purpose treat any Federal convication

20

whether youth or adult, as a first conviction?

21

could do that, couldn’t they?

22
23
24
25

MS. STUNTZs

Yes, Your Honor.

They

I believe that

they could.
QUESTION;

Well, isn’t that pretty close to

what has happened here?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MS. STUNTZ

That is not the primary basis for

2

this Court's decision below —

3

QUESTIONS

Well, you say they —

4

MS. STUNTZ*

5

QUESTION*

— as I understand it.
— didn't articulate it that way,

6

but that's the net effect of the result reached, is it

7

not ?

8
9

MS. STUNTZ*

It may be, but as applied to this

particular case, but I believe the precedential value

10

that this case would set in terms of its construction of

11

the Youth Act Section 5021(b) and when set aside occurs

12

would have an impact far beyond this particular

13

jurisdiction.

14

QUESTION:

At any rate, that's your second

15

point, isn't it?

16

your first point first.

17
18
19

I take it you’d probably want to argue

MS. STUNTZ:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I will

proceed to that.
The government contends that the language of

20

Section 5021(b) is entirely clear and compels the

21

conclusion that a Youth Act conviction will be set aside

22

only when the youth has been discharged prior to the

23

expiration of his probationary sentence.

24

not discharged prior to the end of his _2-year

25

probationary term.

Petitioner was

Therefore, the government reasons in

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the Court below, that this conviction was not set aside.

2

However, Section 5021(b) does not provide for

3

the set-aside of the conviction of a youth offender who

4

is discharged before the expiration of his sentence or

5

whatever sentenee it is that's imposed upon him.

6

The language of the statute is that automatic

7

set-aside shall be granted to those youth offenders who

8

are discharged prior to the expiration of the maximum

9

period of probation, theretofore fixed by the Court.

10
11

Now, as with any question of statutory
construction, it is necessary to go back to the history,

2

structure, and underlying policies of the Youth Act

3

itself, at least briefly because I know the Court is

4

familiar with these matters, to see those -- what those

5

who drafted this language intended to do.

6

In its exhaustive review of the Federal Youth

7

Corrections Act in Dorszynski versus United State, this

8

Court found that the principal purpose of the Youth Act

9

is to rehabilitate persons who because of their youth

20

are especially vulnerable to the dangers of recidivism.

2

In furtherance of this princpal purpose, sentencing

22

judges were authorized to choose from a variety of

23

sentencing options.

24
25

Under Section 5010 of the Act_ a youth offender
may be committed to the custody of the Attorney General

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2346

1

for a period up to six years or such longer commitment

2

as may be authorized for an adult violator.

3

offender may also be placed on probation with the

4

execution or imposition of his sentence suspended.

5

the youth may be senetenced as an adult should the Court

6

find he would not benefit from the Youth Act treatment.

7

The drafters of the Federal Youth Corrections

The youth

Or

8

Act provided a powerful tool to the Youth Act Division

9

to be used in achieving this principal rehabilitative

10

purpose.

11

discharge committed persons unconditionally before it

12

was statutorily required that they do so under the Act

13

because upon such discharge the conviction of the youth

14

would be automatically set aside.

15

This was the Division’s discretion to

It was this provision. Section 5021(a), that

16

was before the United States Court of Appeals for the

17

Fifth Circuit in United States versus Arrington.

18

the Court held that a youth offender's unconditional

19

discharge after satisfactorily completing a six-year

20

sentence under Section 5010(b) of the Youth Act set

21

aside his conviction under Section 5021(a).

22

There

As a result, the offender could not be

23

convicted of violating the Federal law which prohibits

24

the possession of firearms by a convicted felon,

25

U.S.C. Section 1202.

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Citing the Court's decision in Dorszynski, the

1

2

Fifth Circuit stated, if a youthful offender has been

3

unconditionally discharged, the disabilities of a

4

criminal conviction are completely and automatically

5

removed.

6

never had been.

Indeed, the conviction is set aside as if it

7

The government would have the Court discard

8

Arrington as an aberration, not based upon a complete

9

reading of Section 5021.

According to the government

10

and the Courts below, Arrington's conviction was not set

11

aside because Arrington was not released prior to the

12

end of his Youth Act sentence.

13

The Fifth Circuit determined, however, that

14

because Arrington was given a sentence less than that

15

which he could have been given, his unconditional

16

discharge following the completion of that lesser term

17

earned him the set-aside of his conviction under Section

18

5021(a).

19

The Fifth Circuit's construction of Section

20

5021 is true to the distinctive character of the Federal

21

Youth Corrections Act as a tool of rehabilitation rather

22

than one of retribution.

23

Petitioner's case is even stronger than John

24

Arrington's.

Arrington had been committed to the

25

custody of the Attorney General under Section 5010(b)

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and had received unconditional discharge after

2

completing the six-year maximum term provided by Section

3

5010(b).

4

unconditional discharge after serving a probationary

5

term of only two years.

6

Petitioner, on the other hand, received

Now, when the Youth Corrections Act was

7

enacted, no provision whatever was provided whereby

8

youths placed on probation rather than committed could

9

obtain the set-aside of their convictions.

This waited

10

until 1961 when Section 5021(b) was added to extend the

11

same conviction set-aside benefits to youths serving

12

Youth Act probation as had been available to youths

13

committed under the Federal Youth Corrections Act.

14

Unlike the terms of commitment, however, the

15

Federal Youth Corrections Act specifies no maximum term

16

of probation at the end of which unconditional discharge

17

must occur, nor does it provide for mandatory

18

conditional release prior to the end of that maximum

19

term as is the case for committed youth offenders.

20

The government contends that according to the

21

plain language of the statute the youth must be released

22

prior to the term of probation initially imposed in

23

order to qualify for the set-aside of his conviction.

24

This reading of the statute, however, ignores the term

25

"maximum" even though the legislative history makes it

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

clear that the word "maximum" is in Section 5021 both

2

(a) and (b) for a reason.
The reason is to provide a benchmark by which

3
4

the youth eligibility for the set-aside of his

5

conviction can be measured.

6

prior to that benchmark grants automatic set-aside.

7

What is the maximum term of probation theretofore fixed

8

as is discussed in petitioner's reply brief?

9

not an easy question to answer.

Unconditional discharge

This is

Petitioner maintains, however, that the

10
11

drafters of the Federal Youth Corrections Act intended

2

unconditional discharges occurring before six years or

3

such longer period as an adult term may provide to carry

4

with it the set-aside of the conviction underlying that

5

term .

6

Acceptance of the government's contention

7

would lead to a number of anomalous results.

8

offender discharged before the end of an extended period

9

of probation would be treated better than one discharged

at the end of a brief initial period of probation.
QUESTION:

But isn't the thought, Ns. Stuntz,

22

that if someone sentenced under the Youth Corrections

23

Act is discharged prior to the term for which they have

24

probation, however long, that's a recognition of kind of

25

a specially good rehabilitation, whereas if the person

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

simply serves out the term, it's thought that’s probably

2

about as expected but no big pluses?
MS. STUNTZs

3

Your Honor, I think that is

4

precisely why the statute was written as it was,

to, as

5

the government puts out and as petitioner agrees, reward

6

not just average adjustment but — but good behavior,

7

special response to the Federal Youth Corrections Act

8

program.
There is, however, in the language of the

9
10

statute the term "maximum," in recognition of the

11

anomalies that may result were a person discharged after

12

two years not allowed the set-aside of his conviction

13

and yet a person discharged after five years allowed

14

that set-aisde.

15

petitioner contends, to the six years in the original

16

statute, provides a solid benchmark by which all

17

behavior under Federal Youth Corrections Act treatment

18

may be measured, especially in this case where there

19

never was an opportunity for petitioner to be discharged

20

before the end of his two-year probationary term due to

21

the failure of the Probation Department to alert the

22

sentencing Judge to the expiration of his term of

23

probation.

24
25

The term "maximum," which relates back,

The government’s interpretation of Section
5021(b) violates the foremost intent of the drafters of

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MS. ETKIND;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court;

We believe that the question presented by this

1

2

case, whether petitioner is entitled to a set-aside of

3

his conviction under the Federal Youth Corrections Act,

4

is answered in the negative by the plain language of the

5

statute .
18 U.S.C. 5021(b) provides that a court may

6
7

unconditionally discharge a youth offender from

8

probation "prior to the expiration of the maximum period

9

of probation theretofore fixed by the Court which

10

discharge shall automatically set aside" the youth

11

offender’s conviction.
Here petitioner was sentenced to two years’

12
13

probation under the Youth Corrections Act.

14

undisputed that he completed the entire probationary

15

term.

16

discharged prior to the expiration of the maximum period

17

of probation theretofore fixed by the Court.

Accordingly, he was never unconditionally

Yes, he would.
What do you think is the purpose of

the statute?
MS. ETKINDs

I think the purpose of the

24

statute, Congress* purpose, was to hold, out to youth

25

offenders the possibility of a set-aside as an

21

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

inducement to fully rehabilitate themselves and to take

QUESTION;

Even though it's one day before?

MS. ETKIND;

Well, I think — I think it may

have to be one day before.

Congress was looking for

some evidence of this rehabilitation, and the evidence
would be an early set-aside whenever that would come,
particularly in the case of a probation with a short
sentence, it might take nearly the whole sentence to
rehabilitate.
Petitioner was never unconditionally
discharged prior to the maximum period of probation.

He

therefore was never entitled to the set-aside, and the
government was fully intent — was fully entitled to use
it as a basis for the subsequent recidivist penalty.
Petitioner attempts to create ambiguity where
none exists in this statute by focusing on the statute's
use of the word "maximum." and on the absence of any
language in the statute such as "the sentence imposed on
him ."
But it is clear from the phraseology of the
statute, the period of probation theretofore fixed by
the Court, that Congress was talking about the sentence
that would be imposed on the defendant..

And Congress

could not have more clearly expressed that its use of

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

the word maximum referred to "the maximum period of
probation theretofore fixed by the Court."
In addition, petitioner now suggests that
"maximum" may refer to — may refer to the available
sentence or the six-year sentence under the YCA as the
maximum.

But in fact, when a court sentences a

probationer, the maximum to which he can be sentenced
under 3651 in the Federal Courts and also in the D.C.
Courts is five years' probation.

So according to

petitioner's theory, any — any probationer would
ultimately be entitled to set-aside relief.
As I mentioned to Justice Blackman, it was
Congress' purpose in — in — in holding out the
possibility of a set-aside to induce probationers, to
induce all youth offenders, to take advantage of the
treatment and guidance that was offered by the YCA
program.

Accordingly, any construction of the statute

that makes the availability of set-aside relief turn on
the initial sentence as imposed would -- would thwart
that congressional purpose.
And it's for that reason, as well as the more
significant fact that its conclusion flies in the face
of the statutory language, that the Arrington decision
on which petitioner relies and which is. the only
decision contrary to the holding below is of no

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

persuasive force at all.
While the case — while this case here

3

presents — involves the set-aside provision applicable

4

to probationers, Arrington involved the analogous

5

set-aside provision applicable to committed youth

6

offenders; that is, incarcerated youth offenders.

7

That section provides, "Upon the unconditional

8

discharge by the commission of a committed youth

9

offender before the expiration of the maximum sentence

10

imposed upon him, the conviction shall be automatically

11

set aside."

12

Notwithstanding this clear statutory language,

13

the Fifth Circuit in Arrington held that the defendant

14

there, who had completed his —the six-year sentence

15

that was imposed upon him was entitled to a set-aside.

16

That Fifth Circuit decision represents nothing less than

17

a holding that every defendant who is sentenced under

18

the Youth Corrections Act will ultimately be entitled to

19

a set-aside.

20

Petitioner complains that we are — that we

21

interpret the Arrington decision too broadly, that

22

really all that the Fifth Circuit was holding was that

23

any youth offender who was committed to a sentence less

24

than that to which he could have been committed will be

25

entitled to a set-aside.

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

But there is no basis for petitioner's reading

1
2

of the Arrington decision.

In the first place, the

3

Fifth Circuit never articulated such a limited ruling.

4

Indeed, it never even discussed the critical statutory

5

language prior — before the expiration of the maximum

6

term imposed upon him.
And moreover, the petitioner's reading of the

7
8

Fifth Circuit's decision makes no sense at all, as a

9

hypothetical will show.

If you take two defendants,

10

both of whom are sentenced to six years youth — to six

11

years under 50 — Section 5010(b) of the Youth

12

Corrections Act, one of the defendants has committed a

13

string of murdered, the other one has been convicted of

14

loitering.

15

Under — under petitioner's reading of the

16

Arrington decision, the only defendant who would be

17

entitled to set-aside relief would be the mass murderer

18

because only he could have been sentenced to a greater

19

sentence; that is, under Section 5017(c), he could have

20

been sentenced to the maximum -- to a youth offender

21

sentence equivalent to the maximum sentence an adult

22

could have received.

23

But in any event, either reading of the

24

Arrington decision ignores the critical, statutory before

25

the expiration of the maximum sentence imposed on him.

)

1

Moreover, either reading makes the

2

unavailability of set-aside relief turn on the sentence

3

as initially imposed, and therefore it thwarts the

4

congressional purpose of it holding out the set-aside as

5

an inducement to the youth offenders to take advantage

6

of YCA treatment in correctional programs.
