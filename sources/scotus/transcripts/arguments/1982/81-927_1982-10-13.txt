ORAL ARGUMENT OF LINDA K. LAGER, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MS. LAGERi

9 please the Court,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

the principal issue in this case is

10 whether as a matter of federal constitutional law the
11

state prosecution is entitled to show that a

12 constitutional error in an unobjected to portion of a
13

lengthy, detailed, and elaborate jury instruction is

14 harmless beyond a

reasonable doubt.

In 1981, the Connecticut Supreme Court

15

16 foreclosed the prosecution that opportunity by
17 automatically reversing the Respondent’s

1976

18 convictions on attempted murder and robbery after
19 finding

Sandstrom error.

That finding of Sandstrom

20 error was premised solely on the court’s use of the word
21

"conclusively" twice, and the balance of the

22 instructions were in fact described by the Connecticut
23

Supreme Court as "precise, elaborate, and cast in highly

24 permissive language," and the
25 also found that if

Connecticut Supreme Court

the word "conclusively" had not been

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

used in this jury instruction, it would not have found

2 Sandstrom error.
3

The state maintains that a finding of an

4 arguably conclusive presumption did not warrant
5 automatic reversal in this case.

Furthermore, the state

6 of Connecticut maintains that a reviewing court can
7 determine the impact of an unconstitutional jury
8 instruction on the verdict,

and that in this case,

9 because the instruction could have no impact on the
10 outcome of the case, the instruction was harmless beyond
11

a reasonable doubt.

12

The Respondent in this case was charged with

13 four crimes that took place on Saturday night and early
14 Sunday morning of December 20th and 21st,
15 weekend before Christmas.

1975, the

It is not necessary to repeat

16 to this Court the sordid details of the rape and

the

17 kidnapping aspects of this case, because they are not
18 before this

Court.

QUESTION.*

Ms. Lager, that is seven years ago,

20 isn't it?
21

MS. LAGER:

22

QUESTION;

That is correct, Your Honor.
Why did it take four years in the

23 Connecticut court to get decided?
24

MS. LAGER:

25 Connecticut

The case was -- excuse me.

The

Supreme Court decided the case in 1981

4

principally because there were problems in obtaining the

2 complete transcript.

In fact, most of the trial

3 transcript had been obtained in 1977 and 1978.

Then it

4 was discovered that there were portions missing.

Those

5 portions involved the hearing on the motion to

6 suppress.

In this case, there were initially five

7 defendants, and some of the hearings on the motions to
8 suppress were conducted jointly with other defendants.
9

The last portion of transcript involving the

10

motion to suppress was received by counsel on November

11

26th, 1980.

12

argued in June of 1981 under a special briefing schedule

The case was then rapidly briefed and

13 that the Connecticut Supreme Court had set up.
14

What was involved in this case —

15

QUESTION;

16

17

Does this happen frequently in the

state of Connecticut?
MS. LAGER;

18 circumstance.

This was a somewhat unusual

There have been problems in the state of

19 Connecticut —
20

QUESTION;

21

MS. LAGER;

Just somewhat unusual?
— with transcription.

I think

22 the length of the delay in this case was somewhat —
23 extremely unusual.
24

In this case, the victim clearly had ample

25 opportunity in over five and a half hours of being with

5

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the Respondent and his five companions to view them.

In

2 fact, in the course of her testimony before the trial
3 court, she was able to give clear identification of the
4 Respondent and his co-assailants by details of clothing
5 and physical description.

It was also undisputed that

6 the Respondent was the leader of the group, that he
7 initiated the incident, that he took the most active
8 role,

and that he was the most vicious, that he gave

9 directions, that he restrained the victim,

that he

10 threatened her, and that he was the first one to rape
11

her.

12

The crucial facts, I believe, before the Court

13 are those that are surrounding the robbery and the
14 attempted murder,

and I will concentrate this afternoon

15 on the facts surrounding the attempted murder because in
16 my opinion,

and the Respondent virtually concedes that

17 there was overwhelming evidence of intent necessary for
18 robbery by not even discussing those facts in his
19 brief .

20

QUESTION!

May I ask you a question?

21 going to argue that the error was harmless,

You are

I think,

22 now .
23

MS. LAGER;

24

QUESTION;

That is correct.
Before you get to that, I am not

25 quite clear on your position with respect to when the

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

harmless error argument should be made in Connecticut.

2 In the state against Truppi, the court had an opinion in
3 which it discussed that it would sometimes entertain a
4 harmless error challenge and sometimes it would not.
5 Now, if as a matter of Connecticut practice the
6 Connecticut Supreme Court should decide,

well, Sandstrom

7 errors are going to give rise to automatic reversal,
8 would we have power to tell it it could not

9

BS. LAGERs

do that?

I believe that what the

10 Connecticut Supreme Court did is decide as a matter of
11

federal constitutional law that it would not review the

12 error in Truppi as being harmless.

Its citations are

13 solely to federal cases.
14

QUESTION:

Hell, they cite State against Zeco,

15 which is a Connecticut case, State against Sorbo, a
16 Connecticut case, Elman against State, a Connecticut
17 case, State against Briggs, a Connecticut case.
18

MS. LAGER:

Those citations are to cases in

19 which the court, the Connecticut Supreme Court was
20 willing to apply a harmless error rule —
21

QUESTION:

22

MS. LAGER:

Right.
— and the Connecticut Supreme

23 Court has indicated in a decision that was decided on
24 January 5th of 1982, Turcio versus Manson, which was
25 cited at Page 3 of the Respondent's brief,

in a footnote

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that they would not decide in the Turcio case nor did

2 they decide in the Johnson case, this case, that there

3 can be no language or other circumstances which could
4 operate to cure an intent instruction containing the
5 phrase "conclusively presumed."
6

Subsequently, in a decision of Karch 30th,

7 1982, State against Kervin, the Connecticut Supreme
8 Court appeared to be moving towards this Court's total

9 record review analysis in determining whether a jury
10 charge could be harmful.
11

In that case, they

specifically emphasized that the charge should not be

12 examined in a vacuum,

that it should be viewed in the

13 context of the factual issues raised at the trial.

The

14 challenge in that case was premised on Sandstrom and
15 based on a claim that an elemental portion of one of the
16 offenses was improperly given.

In fact, there was a

17 dissent that would have held that charge in violation of
18 Sandstrom.
19

QUESTION;

I am not sure I understand what

20 your explanation of what the state of Connecticut's
21

position is on harmless error on this issue.

Does the

22 court sometimes review it and sometimes not review it?

23

MS. LAGER;

I think that the state of

24 Connecticut has a very ambivalent position with the
25 application of the harmless error rule, and I think it

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

has adopted a case by case review.

I think the reason

2 that the Court declined to apply the harmless error
3 doctrine in State against Truppi, although they
4 considered the issue when it was raised by the
5 prosecution, was because of the nature of the
6 instruction that was given in that case, and in this
7 particular case —
8

QUESTION:

Well, does that mean -- I just want

9 to be sure I follow what you are explaining to me.

Does

10 that mean that the Connecticut Supreme Court as a matter
11 of Connecticut practice sometimes entertains the
12 challenge to instructions and sometimes does not?
13

MS. LAGER:

It appears that the Connecticut

14 Supreme Court as a matter of federal constitutional law
15 sometimes entertains the instruction — the challenge
16 that the error was harmless and sometimes it does not.
17 The only stated position that the Connecticut Supreme
18 Court has given in this regard is the one in State
19 againt Truppi, is that we sometimes apply the harmless
20 error rule.
21

It appears that if the —

22

QUESTION:

Well, is it your position that they

23 must apply it in every case?
24

MS. LAGER:

No, Your Honor, my position is not

25 that they must apply the harmless error rule in every

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

case, but if the prosecution asks the Connecticut

2 Supreme Court to review an error for its harmlessness as
3

a matter of federal constitutional law, that it must at

4

least use the harmless error test.

5

QUESTION;

Let me just state it to be sure I

6 understand it correctly.
7

As a matter of federal

constitutional law, a state supreme court must entertain

8 a harmless -- must make a harmless error examination
9
10
11
12

every time the prosecutor asks it to.
MS. LAGER;

In the context of an

unconstitutional jury instruction, yes.
QUESTION;

Ms. Lager, before you go on, would

13

you mind telling me where "conclusively presumed" was

14

used in the instructions at 23A and 25A?

15

respect of only one of these offenses, or all of them?

16

And if less than all, which?

17

MS. LAGER;

Was it used in

At 23A, Your Honor, the court was

18

giving a general instruction with respect to the

19

question of a finding of intent.

The second time that

20 the word —
21

QUESTION;

This would cover all of the

22 offenses charged.
23

MS. LAGER;

That is correct.

The Connecticut

24

Supreme Court found, however, that the language of the

25

instructions on the kidnapping offense was sufficiently
t

10
AIDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

permissible and phrased solely in terms of inference

2 therefore that any error in the general instruction was
3
4
5

cured by that specific one.
QUESTIONi

The court drew back from that

instruction in the latter part, did he not, where he

6 said, "If you believe the victim's version as to the
7

defendant’s conduct at the bridge, you may presume he

8 intended what would be the natural and necessary
9
10

consequences of his actions."
MS. LAGER:

That is correct, Your Honor, and

11

in fact the argument was made to the Connecticut Supreme

12

Court that what was operating in this case was not

13

merely a conclusive presumption at all, that the court's

14

language was ambiguous.

15

quite a to-do about the fact that the court instructed

16

on a rule of law, but the rule of law that the court

17

instructed on is as follows.

18

of fact for the jury to find.”

19

the jurors.

The Respondent in fact makes

"The intent is a question
That was clearly told to

And then the court said, "However, you

20 should be aware of the rule of law that will be helpful
21

to you, and that is that a person's intention may be

22 inferred from his conduct, and every person is
23
24
25

conclusively presumed to intend."
QUESTION:

In the court's opinion, that

discussion relates only to the first count of attempted

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

murder.

The Connecticut Supreme Court did not discuss

2 that, as I recall it, in the counts on kidnapping and

3 robbery.
4

MS. LAGER:

What the Connecticut Supreme Court

5 found is that this general instruction that appears at
6 the bottom of Pages 22A and 23A of the appendix was

7 unconstitutional despite the other language that was
8 used in the qualifying language in the charge.

It then

9 proceeded to examine each of the four separate offenses
10 to determine whether there was any spillover from that
11
12

general instruction.
QUESTION;

The first being the charge of

13 attempted murder?
14

MS. LAGER;

The first being the charge of

15 attempted murder.
16

QUESTION;

That is where the "conclusively

17 presumed" was repeated at Page 25A?
18

MS. LAGER;

That is correct.

In that portion,

19 after the judge explained to the jury that they must
20 find that the Respondent had the specific intent to
21

cause the death of the victim, and they must ask

22 themselves what intention did the defendant have in

23 mind, did he alone or participating with others intend
24 to commit the crime of murder, and that no one could
25 look into a person's mind and see what the intention

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is.

The court went on to say again in an ambiguous way,

2 "The only way to decide that question is to infer from
3

the accused’s conduct in the light of the surrounding

4

circumstances, but as previously stated, every person is

5

conclusively presumed."

6
7

QUESTION:

We have —

Ms. Lager, am I right in thinking

this about the state's position, that the questions as

8 to whether the instructions considered as a whole might
9

have improperly influenced the jury on the

10

constitutional issue of burden of proof go into deciding

11

whether or not there was so-called Sandstrom error, and

12

then the question of harmless error is whether on that,

13

on the issue that the instructions were addressed to,

14

the evidence was so overwhelming that probably no damage

15

was done?
MS. LAGER:

16

That is an aspect of the state's

17

position.

The state is not before this Court to

18

relitigate the Connecticut Supreme Court's finding that

19

the jury instruction violated — the "conclusively

20 presumed" jury instructions violated Sandstrom.
21

The

state's argument is that the other instructions in the

22 charge and the totality of the entire record in this
23

case, including the overwhelming evidence of guilt,

24

would allow a reviewing court to assess the impact of

25

this unconstitutional instruction on the outcome of the

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1
2

case
QUESTIONS

But I think your response assumes

3 that the Connecticut Supreme Court at any rate simply
4 took'one instruction in isolation, and said, look, this
5 violates the Sandstrom

case, and then didn’t treat the

6 other portions of the instructions that might be assumed
7 to counteract that effect.

I read the Supreme Court of

8 Connecticut's opinion somewhat differently,
9 assimilated

that they

all the balancing of the various parts of

10 the instructions into the final question, did it
11

improperly influence the jury in an unconstitutional

12 way, into the question of was there Sandstrom error, and
13 therefore the question of the harmlessness of that error
14

would have to be taken somehow out of the — outside of

15

the instructions, which have already been fully

16 canvassed in

the determination of whether there was

17 constitutional error.
18

MS. LAGER*

19 that was adopted

I would agree that if the test

would simply require a canvass of the

20 instructions to determine whether the Sandstrom error
21

was harmless, as the Respondent has suggested in his

22 brief, you would have the equivalent of an automatic
23 reversal rule given
24 did in this case.

what the Connecticut Supreme Court
The state's argument before this

25 Court is that one must look at the instructions as part

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of the entire trial record, and determine —

2
3

QUESTION*

Well, would that extend to a

situation where the instruction on intent is clearly

4 wrong under Sandstrom,

and there is no redeeming

5 instruction whatever, so that if you are simply
6 canvassing the instructions, you have to reach the
7 conclusion that the jury was improperly instructed in
8

violation of Sandstrom, but the testimony at the trial

9 is that the defendant took the stand on the question of
10 intent,
11

perhaps was asked the question, did you intend

to do this, and the defendant said, sure.

12 defending maybe on

13 so that you

They were

self-defense or something like that,

would say the error was harmless not because

14 of anything contained in the instructions,

but because

15 the evidence on that issue was so overwhelming the jury
16 would have reached that conclusion no matter what burden
17 of proof it had been assigned.
18

HS. LAGEB*

Yes, I would agree with Your

19 Honor's statement.
20
21

QUESTION;

Could I put it another way, that

the only way to be successful is that the appellant has

22 to first show, has the burden of showing that there is a
23 violation of Sandstrom, and secondly, he must show that
24 there is not harmless error.
25

MS. LAGER*

No, Your Honor.

The state's

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

position would be that the appellant has the initial

2 burden of establishing — the defendant below would hav
3 the initial burden of establishing that there was
4 Sandstrom error, and then according to well established
5 principles of this Court, the burden would shift to the
6 prosecution to establish that error to be harmless

7 beyond a reasonable doubt, and in shifting that burden
8 to the prosecution, the appellate court would be allowed

9 to examine how the instruction affected the outcome of
10 the case.

If the appellate court could conclude beyond a

11

12 reasonable doubt that there is no reasonable possibility

13 that a rationale trier of fact could have entertained a
14 reasonable doubt about intent, so that the instruction
15 resulted in a conviction where there otherwise would
16 have been an acquittal, then, despite the finding of
17 Sandstrom error —

QUESTION:

18

You mean, you assume that you put

19 yourself in the position of a juror who is told about
20 this conclusive presumption.
21

And it has no effect on

him at all.

22

MS. LAGER;

That's not precisely the analysis

23 that —
24

QUESTION:

25

MS. LAGER:

It's close, though, isn't it?
Not exactly. Your Honor, because —

1

2

QUESTION;

Well, how do you get at the word

"conclusive?"

3

MS. LAGER;

4

QUESTION;

5

6
7

What an appellate court —
What do you think "conclusive"

means to the average person?
MS. LAGER;

I think that the word "conclusive"

had to be viewed particularly in this case in context.

8 I think what the jury in this case would have heard are
9
10

the following things.
QUESTION;

In — questions of facts —
My question was very simple.

11

does the word by itself, "conclusive", mean to the

12

average person?

13

MS. LAGER;

14

QUESTION;

15

MS. LAGER;

16

QUESTION;

What

To reach a conclusion, Your Honor.
Reasonable what?
To reach a conclusion.
Well, how can you reach a

17

conclusion as to a presumption that is -- oh, yes, you

18

reach a position he is guilty.

19

MS. LAGER;

Well, that is not exactly what the

20 jury in this case was told.
21

The jury in this case was

told that intent was a question of fact, that they were

22 the fact finders, that the prosecution bore the burden
23

of proving intent among all of the elements of the crime

24

beyond a reasonable doubt, that the jury was to examine

25

and assess the credibility of the victim, who was the

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

only one to supply direct evidence of the acts of the

2 defendant at the time of the offense, that the jury was

3 then to assess all of the objective facts concerning the
4 circumstances, such as the time of day — it was 4*00 in
5 the morning — such as the temperature — it was ten
6 degrees below zero -- such as the fact that the victim

7 unequivocally identified the defendant, such as the fact
8 that the jury never came back in this case and asked for

9 reinstruction on either the attempted murder or the
10 robbery charges, such as the fact that the defense
11

counsel never objected to the instruction that was

12 given, that

the issue of the defendant's intent was not

13 closely disputed or at issue in this case, and that the
14 theory of the defense did not really in any way involve
15 either the attempted murder or the robbery charges.
16

QUESTION*

Hell, after all of that, why did

17 you need the presumption instruction?
18

MS. LAGER*

Well, at the time that that

19 instruction was given, and I don't believe that any
20 court since
21

the Sandstrom decision would give that

instruction, it had been a recognized statement of what

22 I would like to describe as the standardized inference

23 of intent, proving intent from an accused conduct.

It

24 is pretty clear that in most cases, we don't have the
25 hypothetical situation where the accused comes in and

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

says, I did it, except, for example, in a case — and

2 that I intended to do it.

You may have a case like

3

Sandstrom itself where the accused admitted his act but

4

hotly contested the fact that he could form the specific

5

intent.
Therefore, I don’t think the judge could be

6
7

faulted for giving this instruction, given the state of

8 the law, and that there is really a very limited
9

salutary effect in an automatic reversal rule in this

10

type of a case.

Indeed, it would probably be — the

11

more likely effect would be probably be for the public

12 confidence in the administration of justice to be
13

undermined when the general public hears that under the

14 facts and circumstances of

Am I wrong?
I think that —

4 what they were told to do specifically in the attempted

They were told to examine all of

6 the circumstances, to assess credibility, to draw
7 inferences.
8

Furthermore, they were told, properly

9 instructed on the kidnapping charge on how to draw an
10 inference of intent from conduct, and the only

12 was a reinstruction on the kidnapping charge.

for rebuttal
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Barnett?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERROLD H. BARNETT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BARNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

6 please the Court, this case — this case involves the
7

question of whether an admittedly unconstitutional

8 instruction that posited the element of intent as a
9

question of law, contrary to decisions of this Court,

10

and which remained uncured in a viewing of the charge as

11

a whole, can ever be considered harmless error by virtue

12 of the strength of the state's evidence.

That is the

13

position that the Petitioner has taken here today, and

14

it is the position taken in the Petitioner's brief.

15

There is really no question that the error was

16

not corrected by the remainder of the charge.

There has

17

been some mention that the inference charge on intent,

18

concedally permissible in the specific instructions on

19

the kidnapping charge, constituted some sort of a cure,

20 but the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled otherwise when
21

it refused to import the kidnapping instructions into

22 the instructions on robbery which was the third count,
23

for the reason that the structure of the charge did not

24

permit such a construction.

25

The initial error was made common to all

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

crimes involved in the information.

MR. BARNETTs

Was that the one at Page 23A?
That's the one that appears on

4 Page 23A, Justice Brennan.
5

QUESTIONS

6

MR. BARNETTs

With the word "conclusive."
The word "conclusive," where the

7 jury was instructed on a rule of law that every person
8 is conclusively presumed to intend the natural and

9 necessary consequences of his act, and of course in
10

Sandstrom versus Montana, this Court noted that

11

"presume" had a common meaning of acceptance of a

12 proposition as true without proof, and "conclusively,"

13 of course, has common meanings of irrefutable, final,
14 and decisive.
15

QUESTIONS

I am not sure I understood the

16 state's position just as you have stated it.

I thought

17 the state's position was that taking the record as a
18 whole, that is, the instruction as a whole, that there
19 was sufficient ambiguity to afford a basis for a
20 harmless error holding.
21

MR. BARNETTs

I do not understand the state's

22 position to be such, Your Honor.

I understand the

23 state's position to be that a cure may have been
24 effected by the specific instructions on kidnapping.
25 However, the Connecticut Supreme Court refused to follow

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

such a suggestion because of the structure of the

2 charge, and further, it could only mean that if the
3

state's position were made and considered, that the jury

4

would have been submitted these crimes on two theories,

5

one concededly unconstitutional, and one claimed to be

6 constitutional, and I believe that settled law is that
7

if the theories are to be viewed as alternatives, that

8 the unconstitutionality, the admitted
9
10

unconstitutionality would require the convictions to be
set aside.

11

Yes, Justice Rehnguist.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett, supposing that an

13

appellate court reviewing a claim of Sandstrom error in

14

the charge to the jury saw there was one sentence in a

15

very long set of instructions that might be interpreted

16

as suggesting a conclusive presumption, but came across

17

seven or eight restatements of the proposition, as you

18

often get in a series of complicated instructions, which

19

simply used the -- clearly spoke in terms of an

20 inference that was permissible under the Sandstrom
21

decision.

It concludes on the basis of all that that

22 the jury simply wasn't misled.
23

Now, is the proper result for that appellate

24

court to say there was no Sandstrom error, or that there

25

was Sandstrom error but it was harmless, without

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

examining into the evidence at all?

2

MB. BARNETT:

My position, if Your Honor

3 please, is that it would be proper for an appellate
4

court to rule on the possibility of misunderstanding

5

solely from the language of the charge, that if there

6 was language which imported a conclusive presumption
7

that the error could only be corrected in the charge.
QUESTION:

8

Well, but supposing the appellate

9 court concludes that it was corrected in the charge,
10 that there is something that taken all by itself might
11

be Sandstrom error, but other parts of the charge really

12 cured it, so that the impact on the jury was de
13 minimis.

Now, is the answer that the appellate court

14 reaches in that situation that there was no violation of
15 Sandstrom or that there was a violation but it was
16 harmless error?
17

MR. BARNETT:

I think that the appellate court

18 would have to rule or would rule in my opinion that
19 there was no violation of Sandstrom because the charge
20 has to be considered as a whole.
21

QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett, I gather, or do I,

22 that you think that an examination of the evidence is
23 irrelevant to the determination of the issue we have to
24 decide?
25

MR. BARNETT:

I so think. Your Honor, and I

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 base that on what I am going to posit to the Court is a
2 concept of what is a jury's verdict, and I refer to
3 language used by Justice Rutledge in Kotteokos versus
4 the United States, where he said that a verdict is more
5 than a judgment on the facts.

A verdict is a judgment

6 of law rendered by a court of laymen, and T think that
7 that language explains why this Court has treated
8 incidents of instructional error differently than it has
9 treated incidents of evidentiary error.
10

QUESTIONi

Now, do you suggest that we have

11 never treated for harmless error purposes instructional
12 error?
13

MR. BARNETT:

14 suggestion.

No, I do not make that

My suggestion is that although Petitioner

15 has not placed much emphasis on the word "conclusively,"
16 that when the Connecticut Supreme Court said that the
17 convictions had to be overturned because the word
18 "conclusively" was used, "conclusively" became more than
19 a word, and I think the decision of the State Supreme
20 Court shows that.
21

"Conclusively" became a concept.

The Connecticut Supreme Court overturned these

22 convictions because in its opinion this instruction
23 withdrew the element of intent from the jury's
24 factfinding function insofar as attempted murder, where
25 it was specifically stated for the second time, and

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

insofar as the crime of robbery was concerned, where

2 nothing was stated as to how the element of intent
3 should be ascertained, and it became a sort of guessing
4

game between the invalid presumption and the subsequent

5 mention of inference in the kidnapping instructions, and
6

by taking it from the factfinding function of the jury,

7 by effectively eliminating intent as an element of the

8 crime, what has been done is that the factual elements
9 of the crime have been taken from the decision of the
10 only body which is constitutionally able to make that
11
12

decision, namely, the jury.
And in brief, my position here today is that

13 the invalid presumption amounted to a directed verdict.
14 It was the functional equivalent of a directed verdict.
15

QUESTION*

Well, Hr. Barnett, isn't your

16 position basically an attack on the whole notion of
17 harmless error?
18 California,

Certainly in Harrington against

the court seemed to have been faced with a

19 similar argument, the argument that you can’t put
20 yourself in

21

the position -- an appellate court can't put

itself in the position of jurors, but as I understand

22 it, the court rejected that argument.
23

It said, we don’t

know, of course, what jurors sat, but our judgment has

24 to be based on our reading of the record and what seems
25 to be the probable impact of two confessions on the

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

minds of an average jury.
Certainly, in that case, they thought they

2

3 could decide what a reasonable jury would have done
4 without that particular unconstitutional Bruton
5 violation.

MR. BARNETT:

6

That is true, Justice Rehnguist,

7 and I stated that the Court has treated instances of

8 instructional error differently from instances of
9 evidentiary error,

QUESTION:

10
11

such as existed in Harrington.
What cases are you relying on for

treatment of instances of instructional error?
MR. BARNETT*

12

I am relying on Wyler versus the

13 United States, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and
14 Joiners versus the United States, Bollenbach versus the
15 United States.

QUESTION :

16
17 court,

All of those were trials in federal

weren’t they?

18

MR. BARNETT:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, they were.

And wasn’t the court in those cases

20 interpreting a statute of Congress providing that

21

technical errors shouldn’t be used as ground for

22 reversal?
23

MR. BARNETT:

That is correct, but I believe

24 that this Court in Chapman versus California mentioned
25 that the rule adopted in that case, very much like the

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

federal harmless error statute that preceded it, was not

2 designed to relate to substantial rights, so I think
3
4
5
6

those cases do become very relevant.
QUESTION:

But there is no reason why one

should govern the other, is there?
MR. BARNETT:

Well, I think that the idea of

7 directed verdicts and their functional equivalents have
8 been discussed by this Court lately.
9

Brennan's concurrence in Chiarella versus United States,

10 which is cited in both briefs,
11

I refer to Justice

that where it — where

the error is evidentiary, apparently from the nature of

12 the violation, the material is admitted improperly for
13 the jury's factfinding determination.

Therefore, on

14 review, a court can eliminate that tainted item and

make

15 a determination of what impact it had upon the jury, and
16 furthermore, in evidentiary matter, the jury, of course,
17 is told that it is the supreme judge of facts, it may
18 accept or reject any evidence.
19

When it comes to instructional error, the jury

20 has no choice.
21

The jury is always told that it has a

duty to abide by the instructions given to it by the

22 court, and I believe that this Court has said that the
23 crucial assumption behind the constitutional scheme of
24 trial by jury is that the jury will listen,

follow, and

25 obey the instructions.

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

So therefore in the case of instructional

2 error, you must start with the proposition that the
3 error had an impact on the jury in the sense that they
4 understood and followed.
5

QUESTION*

And that it is irreparable other

6 than by better instructions?
7

MR. BARNETT*

It cannot be cured except by

8 other language in the charge.
9

QUESTION*

Well, now, in this case, Mr.

10 Barnett, I appreciate that argument as to the attempted
11

murder, where twice "conclusive" was used, but how do

12 you carry this as instructional error into the other
13 convictions —
14

MR. BARNETT:

15

QUESTION*

16

MR. BARNETT*

Into the robbery —

Yes.
-- conviction.

Justice Brennan,

17 I believe it is Footnote 4 of my brief where I mention
18 that the robbery — the effect of this court's decision
19 on the robbery conviction will not afford Mr. Johnson
20 one less day in the prison.
21

Footnote 3 sets forth the

sentences, which are consecutive and which are

22 concurrent.

And Footnote 4 mentions that Mr. Johnson

23 petitioned this Court,

and his petition was denied, and

24 as a result of concurrent sentences on robbery and
25 kidnapping,

it really is not factually going to make

32

It would increase his past

He is a recidivist at the present time, Justice

17 0 'Connor.
18

QUESTION:

Is there another one?

That's the

19 robbery.
20
21

MR. BARNETT:

It's the robbery.

What the

Connecticut Supreme Court did in its construction of the

22 charge is that it took the general instructions and

23 analyzed them and found uncured error.

Then it made an

24 analysis between the general instructions and the
25 specific instructions on each crime.

For attempted

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

murder, the error was compounded.

For kidnapping in the

2 second degree, the second charge in the information, the
3

court felt that the error was cured by the permissive

4

inference language that attended the description on how

5

intent should be ascertained for that crime.

6
7

On the third charge, robbery in the first
degree, the court went to great lengths in describing

8 the nature of the intent, but it never described how the
9

intent should be ascertained, so the jury was left with

10

two specific instructions which could be construed as at

11

variance with each other, the attempted murder,

12

admittedly invalid, and the kidnapping, admittedly

13

valid, plus the general instruction which had been made

14

common to all crimes, and in the Truppi case, which is

15

referred to in a footnote in my brief, this procedure is

16

set forth.

17

case held that by giving a general instruction on

18

intent, the jury would interpret that general

19

instruction every time the court mentioned intent.

20
21

The Connecticut Supreme Court in the Truppi

So therefore, when it came to robbery, the
court refused and properly so to speculate on which

22 prior instruction the jury had adopted, and on that
23

basis overturned the conviction also.

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

And on that basis overturn the robbery conviction also.
QUESTION:

Do you think it is always improper

3,for an appellate court to say what the jury might have
4 done under other circumstances?
5

MR. BARNETT:

Well, Justice White, I think

6 that much of it depends upon the instruction.

Where the

7 instruction has been given as a conclusive presumption
8 and is removed from the jury, I believe that this Court
9 recognized in the United Brotherhood case that — and in
10 the Wyler case — that to ask the Court to decide a
11 factual element that was not properly submitted to the
12 jury was, in effect, asking the court —
13

QUESTION:

What about an evidentiary error?

14

MR. BARNETT:

15

QUESTION:

In an evidentiary --

— in which the jury is told, you

16 consider all the evidence; and the jury considers all
17 the evidence.

And then some evidence is found to have

18 been improperly admitted, and the Court finds harmless
19 error on the grounds the jury would have come out that
20 way anyway.
21

MR. BARNETT:

Yes.

In the evidentiary

22 situations it’s somewhat different because of the nature
23 of the violation and the fact that the inquiry proceeds
24 at a lower level, it does not proceed on the level -25

QUESTION:

Well, not unless the appellate

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

court is coming to a conclusion as to what the jury

2 would have done absent the evidence or with the evidence.
3

MR. BARNETT;

4

QUESTION;

5

Yes.

So it’s performing in a way a

jury function.

6
7

Oh, absent the evidence?

MR. BARNETT;

It is, but it can perform it

because it can say with some certitude that this tainted

8 item of evidence had no impact on the jury.
9

QUESTION;

Well, what about the certitude

10 based on the evidence that the jury couldn’t possibly
11

have found anything but that the defendant intended the

12 act ?
13

MR. BARNETT;

First, the appellate court must

14 assume that the jury followed the instruction.

So if

15 the jury —
16

QUESTION;

Well, you have just told us we

17 should assume the jury's followed instructions.
18

MR. BARNETT;

Yes.

That the jury followed the

19 instruction, so if in the decisional process the jury
20 used the invalid presumption as a way to find guilt, it
21

does not affect a cure merely because the appellate

22 court can say the jury would have convicted on the
23 evidence anyway, because it would show that the jury did
24 not act properly in considering intent as a factual
25 element to be adjudged in terms of all the evidence.

36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

QUESTIONi

But if the jury, you say the

2 appellate court is foreclosed from saying, if the jury
3 had been properly instructed, it would have found him

6

MR. BARNETT*

7

QUESTION*

8

MR. BARNETT:

No, Your Honor.

The Court can’t do that?
No, Your Honor, I am saying that

9 if the jury used an improper decisional process fostered
10 by the instruction which it must be presumed that they
11

followed, then that is an error that affected the

12 verdict.

And

that is the test under Chapman v.

13 California.
14

QUESTION:

Well, it affected the verdict.

15

MR. BARNETT*

And the test is not whether the

16 same result would have been achieved had the error not
17 have occurred.
18

That is the test.

QUESTION:

What about the hypothesis that I

19 posed to your opponent?

Supposing that the jury is

20 erroneously instructed along the conclusively presume
21

lines on the issue of intent; the evidence at trial

22 shows the defendant took the stand, admitted intent,
23 simply advanced a self-defense defense by way of
24 avoiding a guilty verdict.

And during closing argument

25 the counsel for the defendant says, we concede intent,

37

1

what we are really arguing about here is self-defense;

2 we think you should find him not guilty for that reason.
3

It goes to the appellate court.

You say they

4

could not say in the light of this situation that

5

whatever burden of proof was put on the State with

6 respect to the element of intent, a reasonable jury
7

would have found it met here?

8

MR. BARNETT;

I must answer the question this

way, Justice Rehnguist —

QUESTION;

11

MR. BARNETT;

12

QUESTION;

13 doing it.

You cannot answer it yes or no?

But you are going to take some time

Okay.
MR. BARNETT;

14
15 little.
16 not in

Yes, I can answer it yes or no.

But may I explain my answer a

My answer is that, no, an appellate court could
the case of an instruction worded as this one,

17 because the wording of this instruction means that it
18 did not

reach the jury in the manner in which it is

19 constitutionally required to.

And for that reason the

20 confession and the admissions of counsel would not act
21

to cure.

And that, I think, is one of the difficulties

22 that courts have had with the Sandstrom situation where
23 the instruction was capable of two interpretations and
24 where the claims may before
25

this Court, somewhat

belatedly, were that the error was harmless because

38

AIDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

assume it was burden shifting, the burden didn't matter

2 because of Sandstrom*s confession.
3

QUESTION:

But on this kind of an instruction,

4

is it your position that no amount of evidence, no

5

matter how overwhelming, could permit a reviewing court

6 to say that it was harmless error?
7

MR. BARNETT:

That is my position, Mr. Chief

8 Justice, that if the instruction posited as conclusive,
9 and I draw that to the analogy to the directed verdict,
10

that no court has the power to direct a verdict in a

11

criminal case no matter how conclusive the evidence may

12

be .
QUESTION:

13

Even if a reviewing court would say

14

that no rational mind could have been misled by the

15

ambiguity in the instruction in the light of the

16

overwhelming evidence?

17

MR. BARNETT:

18

QUESTION:

19

harmless error rule, does it?

21

I maintain that position.

It doesn't leave much left to the

MR. BARNETT:

20

You would maintain that position?

Well, it depends, if Your Honor

please, I submit, on what type of error has been

22 committed.

I maintain that position because of

23

decisions from this Court that there are institutions

24

that have certain functions and that if the function of

25

one institution is taken away from it, then the error

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

cannot be cured because of the constitutional

2 requirement of trial by jury.
3
4

QUESTION;

May I ask, Mr. Barnett, do you

concede that the instruction in this case was ambiguous?
MR. BARNETT*

5

No, I most certainly do not.

I'

6 concede it was the most unambiguous instruction there
7 could be.

QUESTION*

8

Mr. Barnett, may I just ask you

9 what your understanding of the holding of the
10 Connecticut Supreme Court was?
11

I don't read in their

opinion the same theory of defending this judgment that

12 you advance in argument today.

They don't say anything

13 like that.

MR. BARNETT*

14

Justice Stevens, perhaps I

15 should start with answering something that you asked of
16 Ms.

Lager.

The harmless error rule in Connecticut for

17 criminal cases generally revolves about a case called
18 the State v.

Evans, which is cited in the respondent's

19 brief in the section which explains how the error was
20 considered below.
21

State v. Evans rests on two premises*

the

22 Connecticut Supreme Court will consider on a plain error
23 basis claims where error was not claimed at the trial
24 level when a newly articulated constitutional position
25 is announced by this Court and where the record shows

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that the petitioner may have been deprived of a fair

2 trial because of denial of constitutional right.
3

And in this case the decision notes that they

4 have accepted claims made on the basis that this Court's
5 decision in Sandstrom v. Montana.

But they have never

6 ruled on a case where the claim of error involved an
7 instruction stated conclusively as this one.
8

Subsequently, in Turcio v. Manson in a habeas

9 corpus case, convictions were reversed.-

The instruction

10 was either the same or similar to this.
11

QUESTION:

12 understand.

Well, I am still not sure I

Does that mean in your view that they have

13 taken a position that as a matter of Connecticut
14 practice they will always consider a Sandstrom error to
15 be not subject to harmless error?
16

MS. BAFNETT:

No, if Your Honor please, it

17 means that they have taken the position that failure to
18 object to the instruction at trial will not bar you from
19 appellate review in the sense of Wainwright v. Sykes.
20
21

QUESTION:

Well, all right.

So you are over

the Wainwright against Sykes problem, you have got the

22 error before the Supreme Court of Connecticut.

When, if

23 ever, will they allow the prosecutor to say, well,
24 granting there was Sandstrom error, nevertheless it was
25 harmless because we look at the entire record.

Have

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

they passed on that question?
MR. BARNETT;

I don't believe that the

3

Connecticut Supreme Court has passed on that question.

4

Error has been found to exist or not to exist according

5

to the language of the instructions.

6
7

QUESTION:

And what do you understand them to

have done in this case as a reason for rejecting the

8 prosecutor's argument that this error was harmless?
9
10

Why

did they reject that?
MR. BARNETT;

They rejected it because the

11

error, the instructional error, was uncured by the

12

remainder of the charge and because of its conclusive,

13

expressly stated conclusive nature, removed the element

14

that could have been interpreted by a reasonable jury.

15

QUESTION;

But that doesn't really meet the

16

argument that the prosecutor makes that it could also be

17

cured by the abundant evidence of guilt.

18

MR. BARNETT:

19

QUESTION;

No.

They —

And then they don't really deal

20 with that argument, do they?
21

MR. BARNETT:

22 address that.

The decision does not expressly

But I think it is implicit in the

23

decision that an error of this type can be cured only in

24

the charge.

25

QUESTION;

Mr. Barnett, as I understand your

U2
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

position, the Sandstrom function is a functional

2 equivalent of a directed verdict.

If so, why was the

3 case submitted to the jury on the attempted murder
4 question at all?

Why didn’t the Judge simply say that

5 as a matter of law he concluded that the evidence was
6 insufficient to go to the jury on that issue?

MR. BARNETT*

7

8 error, Justice Powell.

That certainly would have been
I think it certainly would have

9 been error.

QUESTION*

10
11

Why?

You say the instruction was

the equivalent —

12

MR. BARNETT*

13

QUESTION*

14

MR. BARNETT:

15

QUESTION*

Yes.

— of a directed verdict —
Yes.

-- on the issue of intent.

Intent

16 is a necessary element of the crime, isn’t it?
17

MR. BARNETT*

18

QUESTION*

Yes, it is.

What’s the difference in this

19 instance ?
20

MR. BARNETT*

May I, Judge?

21

QUESTION*

If the Judge had said —

22

QUESTION*

Can you have a directed verdict in

23 Connecticut in a criminal case?
24

MR. BARNETT*

25

QUESTION*

No, you most certainly cannot.

Never?

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. BARNETT:

Never

And it is my claim that

2 this instruction was the equivalent of a directed
3 verdict.
4

QUESTIONS

Can the Judge just dismiss that

5 count?
6

MR. BARNETT:

Well, the question. Your Honor,

7 is why would the Judge dismiss the count?

We claim that

8 the count was improperly submitted to the jury because
9 the jury was directed to find on an element of the count
10 of attempted murder.
11

QUESTION:

But it still had to find the other

12 elements, didn't it?
13

MR. BARNETT:

The jury still, as a factual

14 situation, would — that is the only, the only, element
15 in which the conclusive presumption was used.
16 Everything else was posited as a question of fact.
17

QUESTION:

You haven’t said very much about

18 the failure to object here.
19

MR. BARNETT:

No, I haven't, Mr. Chief

20 Justice, because the Connecticut Supreme Court accepted
21 the claim.

I have pointed out in my brief in a footnote

22 that the statement in the State v. Ruiz, referred to by
23 Ms. Lager, was not made in the situation of an approved
24 jury instruction.

It was made in a comment by the

25 Supreme Court of Connecticut to a claim that the

44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

evidence in a certain case was insufficient on which to

2 base a jury’s verdict of guilt.

QUESTION;

3

The whole purpose of objections is

4 to give the trial in the courts an opportunity to
5 correct an asserted error, is it not?

MR. BARNETT;

6

Yes, it is, sir.

However, this

7 is a case on direct review, and I think the Connecticut
8 Supreme Court was quite proper in treating it under —

QUESTION;

9

Well, as I understand it,

10 Connecticut Supreme Court practice, or at least that’s
11

what happened here, was that notwithstanding the failure

12 to object —

MR. BARNETTi

QUESTION;

15

That is correct.

16

MR. BARNETT;

18

MR. BARNETTi

Yes, yes. Justice Brenner.

And did.
It did.

And fully considered

19 the issue.
20
21

22

Thank you, Your Honors, for the privilege of
addressing you.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Ms. Lager, do you have

23 anything further?
24

MS. LAGER;

With respect to the claim of the

25 concurrent sentence doctrine that was raised by Mr.

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Barnett, the sentences, in response to your question

2 earlier, Mr. Chief Justice, were 10 to 20 years on the
3

attempted murder count, 8 to 16 years on the kidnapping

4

count, 10 to 20 years on sexual assault, and 5 to 10

5

years on the robbery, which was concurrent with the

6 kidnapping offense.

The effect of the Connecticut Supreme Court's

7

8 reversal is that the the State of Connecticut is obliged
9

to retry the defendant on both the robbery and the

10 attempted murder counts.
11

QUESTION*

12

MS. LAGER*

13

discretion.

15

Or can exercise its prosecutorial

As it stands now, the --

QUESTION*

14

Now, you say obliged again.

But if it does not, the respondent

has 15 to 36, is that right?
MS. LAGER*

16

If it does not, the respondent has

17

18 to 36.

But there is certainly no question of

18

mootness with respect to the the State of Connecticut,

19

who is the petitioner today, and the consequences to the

20 the State of Connecticut.
21

And as far as the reversal of

the defendant's conviction on those charges,

22 notwithstanding the fact that the sentence was
23
24
25

concurrent.
The other point that I would like to make is
that harmfulness of an error should not depend on an

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

absolute rule concerning the point in a trial where the

2 error occurred.

An evidentiary error may be

3 devastating, and an instructional error may be
4 insubstantial or insignificant.

And that is one of the

5 reasons that this Court has announced a harmless-error
6 rule and why it should be appropriately applied in the

7 proper case under the correct circumstances.

Thank you.

Thank you, Counsel.
