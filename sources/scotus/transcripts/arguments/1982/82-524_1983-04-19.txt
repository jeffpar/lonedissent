CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

5

MR. STRAUSS;

6
7

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court.
The issue in this case is whether the Nuclear

8
9

Hr. Strauss, you may

Regulatory Commission adequately considered the impact

10

that disposing of the spent fuel from nuclear power

11

plants will have on the environment.

12

Commission began an informal rulemaking proceeding to

13

consider this and other associated environmental impacts

14

and

15

licenses to build or operate nuclear reactors.

In 1972, the

the effect they should have on applications for

Seven years later the Commission adopted the

16
17

final version of the rule that is at issue here.

18

interim the Commission had conducted two extensive staff

19

studies, three informal rulemaking proceedings in which

20

literally thousands of pages of comments were exchanged,

21

and a total of over two weeks of hearings.

22

itself went through four versions that differed in

23

detail.

24
25

In the

The rule

The rule specifies in a table the amount of
radioactivity that will be released to the environment

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62B-9300

1

in the course of disposing of various kinds of nuclear

2

wastes, and it provides that this table is to be

3

included in the environmental impact statements that are

4

prepared in connection with each individual reactor

5

license.
The licensing boards that consider individual

6
7

applications are then not to receive additional evidence

8

on the amount of radiation released.

9

precluding the boards from reconsidering the radiation

The reason for

10

releases in individual cases is that these releases are

11

entirely generic, that is to say they are always the

12

same for a reactor of a given size no matter where or

13

when the reactor is built.
Many aspects of this rule are not at issue

14
15

here.

For example, the Commission made the very

16

pessimistic assumption that all of the radioactive gases

17

would escape from the wastes, and it listed in the table

18

the resulting amounts of radioactivity that would be

19

released.

20

The aspect of the rule that is at issue here

21

concerns high-level solid wastes, many of which remain

22

radioactive for thousands of years.

23

conclusion reflected in the rule is that these wastes

24

can be buried in a certain geologic formation of a kind

25

that is found in 24 of the 50 states in such a way that

The Commission’s

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

they will not release a significant amount of radiation

2

to the environment.

3

The Commission studied a number of events,

4

natural or manmade, that might cause radiation to escape

5

from such a repository.

6

concluded that a direct hit by a meteorite a mile and a

7

quarter in diameter would release radiation sufficient

8

to contaminate the area within roughly an 11-mile radius

9

of the repository.

10
11
12

QUESTION;

For example, the Commission

But such a meteorite —
Does the record show how many

meteors there are that big they planned around?
MR. STRAUSS;

Well, the record shows that such

13

a meteorite hit could be expected on the average once

14

every ten trillion years.

15

QUESTION;

So they do not have any record of

16

the most recent one?

17

(Laughter)

18

!1R. STRAUSS;

An earthquake fault, the

19

Commission estimated, would occur at a typical site

20

every 25 billion years.

21

unlikely occurrence is that ground water would penetrate

22

the repository, but ground water usually moves very

23

slowly and the Commission calculated that by the time

24

the radioactive materials in the groundwater reached the

25

surface they would be so diluted and they would have

A more likely although still

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

decayed to such a degree that a person receiving the

2

maximum exposure to that ground water would be subject

3

to radiation roughly equal to the background radiation

4

of the atmosphere and the soil.

5

The Commission accordingly concluded that so

6

far as science could determine the chances of a

7

substantial release of radiation from the repository are

8

minimal to the point of being banishing, and the more

9

likely occurrences would not release significant amounts

10

of radition.

11

that conclusion.

12

Now, the Court of Appeals did not question

At the same time the Commission acknowledged

13

explicitly and, in fact, repeatedly that there is, of

14

course, a certain irreducible and imponderable

15

uncertainty involved in predicting what will happen so

16

far into the future and in making predictions about a

17

repository site that has not yet been specifically

18

designated.

19

these uncertainties exist, a reasonable working

20

assumption that the licensing boards are to use is that

21

there will be no releases of radiation from the solid

22

wastes once the repository has been sealed.

23

But the Commission concluded that although

The Court of Appeals had invalidated an

24

earlier version of the rule on the ground that the

25

Commission did not follow sufficiently elaborate

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

procedures in assessing the impacts of nuclear wastes.

2

This Court reversed.

3

On remand, the Court of Appeals, now working

4

with a rulemaking record that had been greatly

5

supplemented by the Commission, invalidated all versions

6

of the rule on the ground that the Commission violated

7

the National Environmental Policy Act when it determined

8

not to allow licensing boards to reconsider in

9

individual proceedings the uncertainties associated with

10

the disposal of high-level wastes.

11

certiorari.

12

We then sought

Although the Court of Appeals based its

13

decision sguarely on NEPA, the National Environmental

14

Policy Act, it never identified the language in NEPA or

15

in any decision of this Court that prohibits the

16

Commission from doing what it did here.

17

has said several times, what NEPA requires is that an

18

agency consider the environmental consequences of its

19

actions and ordinarily disclose them to the public.

20

As this Court

The Commission did consider the uncertainties

21

associated with high-level waste disposal, and it made

22

those uncertainties fully explicit.

23

of Appeals did not suggest otherwise.

24

both the Court of Appeals and Respondents quote at some

25

length from

In fact, the Court
On the contrary,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

attempting to show what we freely concede, that there

2

are inevitably uncertainties associated with an inquiry

3

of this sort, nor was the Commission's consideration of

4

these issues not meaningful or only abstract as the

5

Court of Appeals suggested.

6

For several years the Commission has been on

7

record as saying that it would not continue to license

8

reactors at-all if it did not have reasonable assurance

9

that wastes could be disposed of safely.

If the

10

ultimate outcome of the Commission's investigation of

11

the waste disposal problem had been that the risks

12

associated with any category of wastes are unacceptably

13

great or if that is ever the outcome because the

14

Commission's investigation of this matter is continuing,

15

the Commission would halt all reactor licensing.

\

16

If the Commission were to conclude that the

17

risks associated with waste disposal, while not that

18

severe, are still grave it would be open to it to

19

decide, for example, to permit reactors to be built or

20

operated only where the need for power is particularly

21

exigent.

22

ascertainable risks are minimal, and as I said the Court

23

of Appeals did not question that conclusion on this

24

rulemaking record and that the unavoidable uncertainties

25

should not affect the rate at which reactors are

But the Commission concluded instead that the

9

1

2

license!
Since that conclusion was reached after

3

thorough, explicit and candid consideration, it simply

4

cannot violate NEPA.

5

QUESTIONS

Mr. Strauss, my feeling about

6

reading the briefs was that it was very much like two

7

ships passing in the night, that apparently each party

8

wanted to follow its own line of analysis and there

9

wasn't too much interaction between them.

What exactly

10

do you think the Court of Appeals did wrong in saying

11

that NEPA could make this -- that NRC couldn't make this

12

a generic rule?

13

MR. STRAUSS;

I think the Court of Appeals

14

relied on NEPA for a requirement that is simply not

15

found in NEPA.

16

QUESTION;

Do you understand the Court of

17

Appeals to have had any broader rationale, perhaps I

18

should say more precise rationale, than just the

19

generalized provisions of NEPA?

20

MR. STRAUSS;

I don't. Justice Rehnquist.

The

21

Court of Appeals relied on NEPA to a great extent.

22

also nominally said that the Commission’s action

23

violated the arbitrary and capricious standard, but

24

every time it sail that it right away said and we find

25

the standards to inform the arbitrary and capricious

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

It

1

rule in NEPA.

2

I think what is going on in the Court of

3

Appeals' opinion and in Respondent’s brief as well is,

4

because they do not object to the thoroughness or the

5

candor of the Commission's discussions which is the

6

stuff of NEPA.

7

with an assumption that NEPA requires that environmental

8

impacts not only be considered by the Commission itself

9

but be considered and reconsidered and perhaps

Hhat they seem to be doing is operating

10

relitigatei at every subsequent stage of the agency’s

11

decision-making process where it might possibly affect a

12

subordinate official's decision.

13
14

QUESTION;

Did the Court of Appeals say that

in so many words?

15

SR. STRAUSS;

No, it did not say that in so

16

many words.

17

decision-making process, a phrase Respondents use as

18

well.

19
20
21

It used phrases like the NEPA

Perhaps my questions would be

better addressed to them.
QUESTION;

Say I ask you a question since you

23

requires the preparatio n of an environmenta 1 impact

statement at some stage in the proceedings which

1

uncertainty about the permanent storage of nuclear

2

wastes?

3

MR. STRAUSS;

4

QUESTION*

Yes.

In your view, where will that

5

disclosure be made in the environmental impact

6

statements that may be made consistently with the rule?
MR. STRAUSSs

7

The environmental impact

8

statement at each licensing stage, at both the

9

construction license and the operating license stage,

10

incorporate —

11

QUESTION;

12

MR. STRAUSS:

13

Table S-3?
— Table S-3 and the references

it incorporates which
QUESTION:

14

Well, does that mean that the

15

disclosure we are talking a bout then, in future

16

environmental impact statem ents is that which we can

17

find in Table S-3?
MR. STRAUSS;

18
19

In Table S-3 and the references

it makes incorporating —
QUESTION:

20

Then isn't the legal question

21

whether the incorporation by reference of all these

22

other documents is an adequate compliance with the

23

statute?
MR. STRAUSS;

24
25

question.

Well, that is a possible legal

That is not the ground on which the Court of

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Appeals asserted
QUESTION;

2

I know, but don’t we have to be

3

satisfied on that in order to be sure that the statute

4

has been complied with?

5

MR. STRAUSS;

That could be a potential

6

challenge raised to this rule or certainly to a

7

subsequent environmental impact statement, but the

8

standards for incorporation by reference in

9

environmental impact statements are necessarily

10

flexible.

11

come up with a capsule phrasing of these uncertainties

12

instead of referring people to the fuller discussions.

13

There is really no point in sort of trying to

QUESTION;

Your opponent ends his brief by

14

saying that all that has to be done is to attach a

15

rather short summary that there are, in fact, some risks

16

associata! with this.

17

would preclude such a summary from being attached to

18

individual environmental impact statements that may be

19

made with respect to particular licensing applications?

20
21

22

Do you understand that the rule

MR. STRAUSS;

The rule does not require any

summary to be attached.
QUESTION;

My question is does it forbid it.

23

It forbids the individual decision to reexamine the

24

basic problem, as I understand it —

25

MR. STRAUSS:

That is right.

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

QUESTION

but does it also forbid the EIS

2

that is issued in connection with a particular license

3

application from including a short summary saying well,

4

the Table S-3 should be understood to reflect certain

5

risks associated with the long-term storage of wastes?

6

MR, STRAUSS;

My understanding is that the

7

EISs in individual cases are prepared in accordance with

8

Commission regulations and there would now not be any

9

specific regulation telling the staff to summarize --

10

QUESTION;

I understand there is nothing

11

telling them to do it,

12

prohibiting them from doing it.

13

MR. STRAUSS:

I am asking if there is anything

I do not know of anything

14

specifically prohibiting them from doing it if they did

15

it off their own bat, as it were.

16

trying to think about what advantage would be gained by

17

trying to summarize these uncertainties.

18

that a summary could say any more than what I just said.

19

QUESTION;

I think it is worth

I do not know

Yes, but the thing is that what you

20

have just said is a lot plainer to the ordinary layman

21

than ever what one would get out of reading Table S-3 if

22

he was not as well informed as you are.

23

MR. STRAUSS;

Well, I think that is right.

24

The Table S-3 came with a statement of consideration.

25

The statement of --

QUESTIONS

2

MR. STRAUSSs

And a lot of cross references.
Well, there were cross

3

references in quotations, but I think that accompanying

4

statement lays it out quite clearly, about as clearly as

5

I have laid it out to the Court that there are

6

uncertainties associated here.

7

that the Court of Appeals quoted from at such length.

8
9

QUESTION;

That is the language

I understand, but that is something

you hava to go to another document to find.

10

MR. STRAUSSs

That is right, but that, I

11

think, there are two points to be made about that.

12

CEQ guidelines that were in effect at the time this

13

Council of Environmental Quality got them as they were

14

in effect at the time the rule was issued specifically

15

envision incorporation by reference of other documents.
QUESTION;

16
17

To this extent?

The

Do you think to

this extent?
MR. STRAUSS;

18

Wall, they are flexible.

They

19

do not specify the extent, and it is just pointless to a

20

large extent to require the documents be attached to an

21

environmental impact statement instead of simply saying

1

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, I doubt very much that

2

anyone who is interested in this problem would not know

3

what to do when he looked at that Table S-3.

4

I think actually, Justice Stevens, you brought

5

out another point about what the Commission has done

6

here as opposed to what Respondents and apparently the

7

Court of Appeals would have them do.

8

made a very clear and visible and public focused

9

decision on a matter of no small importance, the

The Commission has

10

question whether reactor licensing is to continue at the

11

same pace despite these imponderable and irreducible

12

uncertainties.

13

The Commission made its decision, made it

14

visibly, and that is exactly the sort of thing that NEPA

15

is supposed to encourage.

16

would have the effect of scattering the decision on this

17

question among a multitude of very low visibility

18

decisions made by licensing boards in particular cases,

19

decisions that because these uncertainties are really

20

inherently unquantifiable would necessarily be kind of

21

inscrutable, and it cannot be the case that NEPA

22

requries a less visible decision that members of the

23

public would have a more difficult time appreciating

24

than what the Commission did here.

25

The Respondent's solution

I should say that we are not suggesting that

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

there are no limits at all on an agency’s ability to

2

organize its internal affairs and to allocate

3

decision-making responsibility between the agency itself

4

and its subordinate bodies, but the question is one of

5

the overall reasonableness of what the agency has done.

6

It is not a specific inflexible mandate from MEPA, and I

7

think in order to best understand the reasonableness of

8

what the Commission did here, reasonableness deriving

9

from the arbitrary and capricious test, the best way to

10

understand it is to think about what the alternatives

11

might have been in as concrete terms as possible.

12

Respondents and the Court of Appeals are

13

somewhat vague on this and understandably so.

14

example, it appears that they would want the licensing

15

board to reconsider these uncertainties in a somewhat

16

plenary fashion.

17

explain to the licensing boards that these uncertainties

18

should persuade them not to license a particular reactor.

19

For

They would want to be able to try to

Well, it is easy to see how that could quickly

20

turn each licensing proceeding into a rerun of this

21

monumental rulemaking.

23

on them is found in many sources, and many arguments and

24

considerations could be brought to bear if this

25

question, to what extent should these uncertainties

affect the decision to license a reactor, if that

2

question were tossed open in individual licensing

3

proceedings.
If that question were not tossed open, if as

4
5

Respondents sometime seem to suggest the licensing

6

boards are just supposed to be given a little package

7

that will explain to them exactly what these

8

uncertainties are and this package is somehow to be

9

inserted in the ledger that licensing boards are thought

10

to draw up, if that and no further inquiry at the

11

licensing board stage is to be permitted, if that is

12

what Respondents have in mind, then you have to wonder

13

just what will be accomplished by that.

14

unlikely to give them any better sense of the

15

uncertainties than what I have said to the Court, as I

16

said, Justice Stevens, or than what the Commission has

17

said, and the result would be that a licensing board

18

would engage in the process of balancing these

19

unquantifiable, imponderable uncertainties against such

20

things as the need for nuclear power.

21

could --

QUESTION:

Is it your understanding, Mr.

23

Strauss, that in these individual licensing proceedings

24

it is a hearing in which people may be heard, I take it,

speak, the values in the table, but you can argue that

9

the established figures in the table show sufficient

10

uncertainty that this particular plant ought not to be

11

licensed.

12

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, the values in the table

13

reflect such uncertainties that exist usually by, as I

14

said in the case of the gases, by saying we will assume

15

everything is released simply by assuming the worst case

16

and to that extent they already have taken into account

17

the uncertainties, and you would be entitled to say,

18

look, licensing this will cause the release of so many

19

curies of such and such a gas and that will have

20

damaging effects on health and —

QUESTION:

And that to me is a ground that I

urge upon you for not granting the license.
MR. STRAUSS:

That is right.

You would be

able to make that argument.
QUESTION:

Mr. Strauss, is that a fair

long-term storage of waste?

3

the licensing hoards are told not to base any decision

on this at all, that that has been decided on a generic

basis which in turn would mean that there would be no

purpose in an individual opponent of a licensing

So the answer to Justice

What you have to assume

So and one could still argue for

the licensing board the worst case hypothesis that

however unlikely it is to occur it is still a reason not

to license?
MR. STRAUSS;

16

Well, the worst case hypothesis

17

is built right into the table.

The Commission in the

18

case of these gases has already done it, and you would

19

be able without even arguing that the licensing board

shoud adopt the worst case hypothesis say our working

assumption is that all the gases will be released.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY B. ATKESON, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ATKESON;

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
We represent Respondent, Natural Resources

11
12

Defense Council, and we are joined by a Respondent, the

13

State of New York, and by 15 other states and several

14

citizens groups as amicae.
The issue in the case before us is the

15
16

integrity of the review process by which environmental

17

review is given to the licensing of individual nuclear

18

power plants under the National Environmental Policy

19

Act.

20

under which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission analyzed

21

the impacts of the nuclear fuel cycle and developed the

22

S-3 table which is attached to Respondent NRC's brief.

23

If the Court would care to examine what the table looks

24

like.

25

Mr. Strauss has identified the S-3 rulemaking

In this table the Nuclear Regulatory

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Commission sets out what is deemed to be the

2

environmental impact at various parts of the nuclear

3

fuel cycle, and if the Court would look down towards the

4

bottom of the table there is a highlighted item referred

5

to as TRU and HLW (deep) which turns out to be

6

transuranic and high-level waste deep, and it is

7

followed by a cryptic number, which in this text is much

8

too hard to read, but which says 1.1 times 10 to the

9

seventh.

10

When this is multiplied out it turns about to

be 11 million curies, by far the highest amount --

11

2UESTI0N;

Eleven million what?

12

HR. ATKESCN:

13

QUESTION!

14

MR. ATKESONi

Excuse me, Your Honor?

Eleven million what?
Eleven million curies, a

15

measurement of radioactivity.

16

far the highes amount of radioactivity represented on

17

this table.

18

Eleven million curies, by

In other words, in the S-3 table the Nuclear

19

Regulatory Commission is instructing its licensing

20

boards that this immense amount of radioactivity, which

21

I would add is generated for each nuclear power plant

22

per year, is to ba regarded as having throughout the

23

hundreds and thousands of years of its intense toxicity

24

zero release to the environment.

25

This means that the licensing boards which

1

2

plants are being instructed that for all practical

3

purposes the high-level waste disposal problem does not

exist.

5

the government is arguing is that an agency may taken an

generically in the abstract, and then for policy reasons

eliminate it from consideration in subsequent actual

decision making about actual nuclear power plants by

It is conceded that the problems of the
disposal of high-level waste are significant.
QUESTIONi

Mr. Atkeson, do you support the

14

Court of Appeals reasoning for deciding that the Nuclear

15

Regulatory Commission ought not to have done this on a

16

generic basis?

17

ME. ATKESONi

Mr. Justice Behnquist, we

18

contend that the Court of Appeals was correct in saying

19

that it as a decision-making device this was improper,

20

that the decision making involved here is the review of

21

actual nuclear power plants and that the rule, if it had

22

been made correctly, could have been reviewed and

23

applied in that licensing.

24

at the conclusion that the decision was a clear error of

25

judgment, it could not be applied.

But since the Court arrived

Well, what is it about NEPA that

prevents a generis approach like this?

the language?

that the principle opinion never points to any section

of the Act.

about the impact of high-level waste disposal, I think,

QUESTION;

I take it from your answer you are

3

simply unable to cite any section of NEPfl that supports

MR. ATKESON;

Hell, the problem here is the

6

problem that the generic result that the Commission

7

actually found in its acknowledged uncertainties and

8

risks associated with high-level waste disposal were

9

then not factored into the S-3 table.

identify all the major areas of uncertainty.

involved, though, that on the one hand they would say we

12

concede this, we concede this, we concede, but for

Mr. Strauss says that he is perfectly prepared

18
19

to have some supplementing of this as he said in

20

response to Justice Steven’s question, but he is not

21

prepared to allow the licensing boards to take account

22

of that uncertainty and that is the basic problem here.

23

The National Environmental Policy Act —

24

QUESTION;

25

if I may.

Mr. Strauss, let me just interrupt

I know Justice Rehnquist tried, and I would

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

like to try again.

What provision of what statute do

2

you rely on to say they had the duty to do that?
MR. ATKESON:

3

Mr. Justice Stevens, the

4

provision of the statute involved is the provision of

5

the National Environmental Policy Act, Section 1022(c)

6

which says that the environmental impact of the action

7

is to be set out in the environmental impact statement

8

and is to accompany the proposal through the agency

9

review process.

In this case, the agency review process

10

starts with the licensing board.

It is the licensing

11

board that is the only entity in the Nuclear Regulatory

12

Commission that considers the environmental impact

13

statement.

14

In other words, if this issue is screened off

15

from consideration by the nuclear licensing board, then

16

nobody considers it in the context of an actual power

17

plant licensing.

18

QUESTION:

Do you by that argument then

19

suggest that it would never be permissible to have a

20

generic rule excluding any issue from individual

21

consideration?

22

MR. ATKESON:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

As the lower —

Any issue affecting the

environment, that is.
MR. ATKESON:

if the record in this case has warranted a finding that

2

there was zero environmental effect then the Commission

3

would have been warranted in instructing the licensing

board to take no account.

We are saying that the error of

the Court can be considered in one way or the other, and

I think that is the way the lower court put it.

It said

11

the Commission has made either a mistake of judgment in

12

assessing the impact and setting it out, or it has made

13

a procedural error in precluding the licensing boards

from considering this factor.
The essence of the problem here is that the

2

likely effact on the environment?

3

MR. ATKESON;

It is possible that the

4

Commission could argue that since it has authority under

5

the Atomic Energy Act to license or not license a

6

nuclear power plant that it could adopt such a rule

7

under that Act, but it would seem to us on the basis of

8

the record in this case that it would be arbitrary and

9

capricious for it to say on the basis of the facts as

they are here that those facts could never in any future

considered.

QUESTION;

Mr. Atkeson, when airlines are

Is that not something of what we are

MR. ATKESON;

I know that the question of how

23

much risk is acceptable is constantly under

24

consideration in our society, and I know that one of the

25

purposes of this rulemaking was to quantify the risk as

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

precisely as possible, and I think that the Commission

2

has done a tremendous job in this respect in the seven

3

years of the rulemaking.

4

that the Commission acknowledges as a continuing area of

5

uncertainty and risk, and it seems to us that it is

6

incumbent on the Commission to set that out candidly in

7

the S-3 table and if it is set out there at an

8

appropriate time in the future in the case of a perhaps

9

marginal plant that a decision is made not to go forward

But what is left at the end is

with that.
