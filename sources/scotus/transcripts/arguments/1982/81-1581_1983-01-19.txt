OPAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. LILLY, ESQ.

6

MR. LILLY;

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8

please the Court, the question presented by this case is

9

whether state-created pretransfer procedures prior to an

10

interstate transfer of an inmate implicate a liberty

11

interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.
We believe that the Court should not so

12

13

broaden the concepts of the due process clause to so

14

extend it to mere procedures prior to interstate

15

transfer where there is no underlying substantive

16

liberty interest at stake.
Now, Delbert Kaahanui Wakinekona is a maximum

17
18

control, maximum security inmate of the Hawaii prison

19

system.

20

including life without parole for murder in

22

Hawaii State Prison.

prison within the Hawaii State Prison System, a small

24

prison with its own programs, with its own walls within

25

the institution to house maximum security type inmates.

1

On August 2,

1976, there was a series of

2

hearings conducted by what is called the Program

3

Committee, which is not unlike the type of committees

4

you see in almost every prison system throughout the

5

land, to ascertain why the programs within the maximum

6

control unit had failed.

7

Mr. Wakinekona, along with every other inmate

8

of the maximum control unit,, were interviewed.

9

Subsequently, the same committee provided notice to Mr.

10

Wakinekona that within five days they would hold a

11

hearing to determine whether his classification within

12

the system should be altered, and whether or not he

13

should be transferred to another part of the prison

14

system, another prison within Hawaii, or transferred

15

interstate.

16

A hearing was held before this committee.

19

forth in the notice.

considering certain actions about him.

He

He was provided

He was advised why they were

And ultimately, after the hearing was

22

concluded, he received a notice of recommendations on

23

his security classification that it should remain as

24

maximum, that he continued to be a security risk within

25

the Hawaii prison system, and that because of major

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

changes that were going to be undertaken by the system

2

and that is, to terminate the maximum control unit,

3

pending construction of the State of Hawaii's new master

4

plan, master correctional plan, that because there would

5

be no programs available in Hawaii for maximum control

6

inmates, there would be no institution set up for

7

maximum control type inmates, that they recommended that

8

Nr. Wakinekona be transferred to a mainland facility.

9

That recommendation was followed by the

10

administrator, the final decision-maker under Rule 4 of

11

our rules, Mr. Antone Olim, who made the decision to

12

transfer Mr. Wakinekona to Folsome Prison in

13

California -QUESTION;

14

Mr. Lilly, in reading the Ninth

15

Circuit's opinion, I had some difficulty, because I

16

couldn't find any place where the rules were set out.

17

Can you tell me somewhere in the briefs or appendix

18

where these rules they were talking about are set out?
MR. LILLY;

The rules are attached in the

QUESTION;

Thank you.

23

MR. LILLY;

And if you will read in the --

24

Those rules provide two basic processes that are

25

addressed.

There is an adjustment process in Hawaii for

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

your traditional disciplinary type actions, where the

2

committee makes actual decisions to punish inmates based

3

upon substantial evidence of rule violations.
That is to be contrasted with the Program

4
5

Committee process, which is under the classification

6

process,

7

system on an ongoing basis to determine where that

8

person best fits within the prison system, to determine

9

what kind of classification he should have, and where he

where they review every inmate within the

10

should be housed within the system.

11

— It is described, the classification process is

12

described in its purpose as a dynamic process that

13

provides a continuing evaluation of every inmate based

14

upon a multiplicity of factors, one committed basically

15

to the discretion of the officials.

MS . LILLY :

2

There is no question that when you

3

have an interstate transfer, that it makes it more

4

onerous.
QUESTION:

5

This is a little more than a normal
Like for example if you transfer

interstate transfer,

7

somebody from Newark to New York City, that is crossing

8

a river, and this is crossing a body of water, but it is

9

not a river.
MR. LILLY:

10

I agree w ith you that it presents

11

different situations, except it is not unlike, for

12

example, the Court's considerat ion in the Howe versus

13

Smith case last session, in whi ch an inmate was

14

transferred from Vermont to the federal prison in

15

Georgia.

It is also not unlike

Vermont and Georgia.

18

MS. LILLY:

It's -- if I may say -- I agree

19

with that.

20

for inmates to -- for visitation interstate, but it is

21

also not unlike this Court's reversal, vacation in Howe

22

versus Maderis last session, in light of Howe, in which

23

three of our inmates had been transferred to a federal

24

prison system in Marion, Illinois.

QUESTION;

It is within the

Well, it always involves a

balancing of all the interests, does it not?
MR. LILLY;

It is a very delicate balancing.

We don't do it so often, because it is very expensive,

10

but when we do it, we do it because there are necessary

11

considerations, and in this case, with Mr. Wakinekona,

12

there would be absolutely no place for him within the

13

Hawaii prison system with the termination of the maximum

14

security unit.

15

and would have no opportunity for any kind of

16

programming.

17

there was -simply no place for him.

18

He would basically be placed in a cell,

Once his status was remained at maximum,

QUESTION;

Mr. Lilly, what specific rules were

not followed by the state in connection with the process

of this transfer?

of the program committee?

Was it Rule 4-2, on the composition

MR. LILLY;

Apparently, what is alleged, that

23

it was -- the composition is the -- claiming that Mr.

24

Wakinekona did not have an impartial tribunal.

25

QUESTION;

Is that the only alleged failure to

MR. LILLY;

I think that's probably the

basic --

QUESTION:

As you understand it?

5

MR. LILLY;

As I understand it.

If you read

6

the complaint, he doesn't even contest the basis for the

7

decision.

8

about —

There is no allegation anywhere in this case

QUESTION:

9

But as you understand it, the sole

10

defect here, if there is one, would be in the

11

composition of the program committee that --

12

MR. LILLY;

13

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.
— provided the hearing.

And do

14

you agree that under Hawaii's adopted rules, that the

15

transfer here would fit the definition of a grievous

16

loss?
MR. LILLY:

17
18

For purposes of this argument, we

will.
QUESTION;

19

May I ask just a guestion about

20

your prisons? Where was he incarcerated before his

21

transfer to California?
MR. LILLY:

MB. LILLY:

QUESTION:

3

MR. LILLY:

Just outside of Honolulu.
It is on Oahu?
It is on Oahu.

It is basically in

4

an industrial area, and within the prison system there

5

is the maximum control unit, which no longer exists

6

today.

7

QUESTION:

Do they have similar institutions

8

on other islands in the state?

9

MR. LILLY:

Every island has an institution,

10

basically medium security facilities for people who live

11

in that locality.

12

QUESTION:

I see.

You haven't had this kind

13

of problem with intra-island transfers?

14

contesting your right to move an inmate from one island

15

to another within the state?

16
17

MR. LILLY:

Nobody has been

We have had a number of contests.

We have had contests about intrastate transfers.

QUESTION:

I see.

19

MR. LILLY:

And a number of state actions

20

contesting interstate transfers.

21

transfers in this period of time when we were reducing

22

23

that time, not unlike Vermont in the Howe case, where

24

they eliminated their maximum control facility.

There were a number of

Mr. Wakinekona filed suit in federal court in

Honolulu for money damages and a dec laration that his

constitutional rights were violated,

him to the mainland was in any way w rong.

that he was transferred from one hoi e to another, only a

larger one, but he does not allege i n any respect that

15

different between the Hawaii system and the mainland

system.

17

The Ninth Circuit reversed the District

18

Court's decision that on the face of his complaint he

19

did not allege a liberty interest protected by the

20

Fourteenth Amendment.

21

to one opinion that the procedures, the detailed

22

procedures here alone created a constitutional right to

due process, that it implicated a liberty interest.

The Ninth Circuit held in a two

It did so in the face of an opinion rendered
by the Hawaii Supreme Court which interpreted this

particular rule, Lono versus flriyoshi, which is attached

2

to the petition for certiorari.

3

Court specifically held that Rule 4 contained no

4

standards, contained no limitations on discretion, was a

5

mere procedural rule, and if you read it carefully, you

6

have to come to the conclusion that the Supreme Court is

7

saying that Mr. Wakinekona had absolutely no

8

expectation, reasonable or otherwise, except for a

9

unilateral one, in Hawaii laws, in Hawaii regulations,

10

to remain in the Hawaii prison system, that the prison

11

system has the absolute discretion, consistent only with

12

constitutional standards, to transfer inmates to the

13

mainland.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

2

4

Mr. Lilly, you may

proceed.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. LILLY, ESQ. - CONTINUED

5

MR. LILLY:

Thank you. Your Honor.

6

The due process claim raised by the Respondent

7

in this case is grounded in whether he has a liberty

8

interest to remain in the Hawaii prison system as

9

contemplated by the due process clause of the United

10

States Constitution, and implicit in the notion of due

11

process is the freedom of restraint in any significant

12

way, such as, for example, in this Court's on parole and

13

early release, for example, in Wolff.

14

And from Roth on, this Court has said that we

15

look to the nature of the interest, and not the weight,

16

and that is where grievousness seems to come into play,

17

as to whether that constitutes a basis for a liberty

18

int erest.

19

Now, in last term, and I think I misspoke

20

earlier, the Howe case, Howe versus Smith, had a

21

companion case.

22

three Hawaii inmates were transferred to the federal

23

system in Marion, Illinois, and it was — the same issue

24

was raised in that case as was raised in Howe, and in

25

light of Howe, Hawaii versus Maderis was remanded.

It was Hawaii versus Maderis, in which

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

There was no suggestion in those cases that an

1

2

interstate transfer was grievous in a constitutional

3

sense.

4

aspect of due process, if it is — has any vitality at

5

all after the Iago decision, and after the Meachum

6

decision, is that Wakinekona, Sr. Wakinekona would stand

7

in no different position in this case than if he were a

8

federal prisoner in Hawaii, and there being no federal

9

prison in Hawaii, he would have been transferred

10
11

Indeed, for purposes of arguing the grievous

interstate.
And Mr. Wakinekona is not irrevocably sent to

12

California.

13

under the Western Interstate Corrections Compact,

14

attached to our brief in this matter, he remains a

15

Hawaii prisoner, and he remains under the Hawaii

16

statutes and rules and regulations.

17
18
19
20
21

He still remains a Hawaii prisoner, and

QUESTION:

Mr. Lilly, what is the doctrine you

say you think has little vitality after Meachum?
MR. LILLY:

The notion that grievous loss in

any way on its face implicates a liberty interest.
QUESTION:

I think the decisions from this

22

Court, maybe some have avoided use of the term and some

23

haven't, perhaps just because of its vagueness, but in a

24

sense Hawaii has brought its problems on itself here.

25

mean, these regulations one might think were perhaps

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

I

1

drawn by a social worker, but they do use the term

2

"grievous loss."
ME. LILLY:

3

They were -- the rules are -- I

4

think it is probably a poor choice of words.

It was in

5

some respects ambiguous, but at the time when these

6

rules and regulations were adopted, there was no

7

definitive ruling in a sense by this Court as to what

8

was or was not a grievous loss.

9

going in the direction of grievousness as having some

Indeed, it seemed to be

10

kind of a liberty triggering process, and I think Hawaii

11

had that in mind when that — those words were

12

utilized.

13

But even in Iago, it was decided that there

14

was no question that he suffered a grievous loss, but

15

that was not of a constitutional dimension.

16

question that Mr. Wakinekona complains about being

17

transferred, but he doesn't complain about the decision

18

to transfer, and that doesn't necessarily implicate a

19

liberty interest.

20

QUESTION:

There is no

Well, you say he complains about

21

being transferred, but he doesn't complain about the

22

decision to transfer.

23

ME. LILLY:

About the actual decision.

He

24

does not complain that the decision to transfer him was

25

incorrect in any material respect.

He complains about

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the processes, the procedures and the hearing before our

2

Program Committee, saying that that was incorrect, and

3

therefore his due process rights were violated.

4
5
6

QUESTIONS

How would you know what the result

would be before a different kind of a tribunal?
MR. LILLY;

If — in this particular case,

7

Hawaii has adopted rules and regulations to provide for

8

procedures, which gives him a modicum of process, but

9

has not said that Mr. Wakinekona has in any respect a

10

right to remain in Hawaii.

11

or entitlement to remain within the system, and

12

therefore due process, we contend, does not attach.

13
14
15

QUESTION;

He has no liberty interest

Is the right to have family visits

within liberty, do you consider?
MR. LILLY;

I don't believe -- I don't believe

16

that that's before the Court, but I don't think that the

17

riaht to have family per se visit is necessarily a

18

constitutional right.

19

QUESTION;

20

MR. LILLY;

21

I said a liberty.
I don't think that the right to

have family visit is in itself a liberty, a freedom.

22

QUESTION;

I didn't think so.

23

MR. LILLY;

And our rules and regulations due

24

use the term ''grievousness," but those are the state's

25

rules and regulations.

They are not necessarily

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

intended to be of a constitutional dimension.

2

merely definitional for purposes of defining in what

3

situations it intends to have a procedure prior to

4

taking certain actions with respect to inmates, whether

5

they be deemed adverse to the inmate or even beneficial,

6

because transfers to the mainland in Hawaii can be made

7

for a variety of reasons that don't necessarily mean

8

that the inmate is a bad person, or violated some rule.

9

It is

Indeed, in this case, if you read the

10

decision, the recommendation of the hearing body, they

11

did it basically for his benefit, because there would be

12

no programs available to this inmate in Hawaii. They

3

transferred him to the California system so that he

4

would have available to him programming that would not

5

be available to him in Hawaii.

6
7
8
9
20

21

22

QUESTIONS

I thought he was transferred

because he was such an unruly prisoner.
NR. LILLY:

That is -- There are two parts of

the decision, the recommendation —
QUESTION:

Well, give us both.

Don't just

give us one.
MR. LILLY:

What happened was that they were

23

evaluating in one respect his classification.

They

24

found that because of his security risk, because he was

25

such an assaultive inmate -- he had threatened guards,

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

he was an escape risk, and since his conviction for

2

murder he had committed other crimes — that his

3

classification within the system remained at maximum.
That being the case, they had no choice but to

4
5

recommend that he be transferred to the mainland,

6

because the programs that were available in the maximum

7

security unit in Hawaii would no longer be available

8

with the impending construetion, and they transferred

9

him to Folsome for the purpose of benefitting him with

10

those programs.

QUESTION;

11
12

Now -Benefitting him with those

programs?

13

MR. LILLY;

14

QUESTION;

That’s right.
I suppose the alternative would

15

have been to put him in solitary confinement, create a

16

special cell somewhere and put him in solitary

17

confinement permanently.
MR. LILLY;

18

That is exactly what we are faced

19

with in Hawaii in this period of construction.

20

were a number of inmates transferred to the mainland

21

whose security classification remained at maximum.

22

Other inmates -QUESTION;

23

There

Are there any prisons — You said

24

there were prisons on a number of the islands in the

25

chain.

How many all together, roughly?

Yes.

of — as opposed to focusing down on just what was

10

involved in this particular case.

11

As I understand it, reading the Ninth

12

Circuit’s opinion, the prisoner complains that the panel

13

of the board or the board that made the recommendation

14

to transfer was biased, and your answer is that it

MR. LILLY;

I mean, we would not

In a juror sense.
In a juror sense or even in a

judge sense, because you are still going to have, in a

24

small prison setting, you are going to have the same

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

would certainly not say in the rule that the board

2

should be a biased one.
QUESTION;

3

Would you think there are any

4

senior staff members eligible to sit on this process who

5

would not generally know about this fellow's record as

6

an assaultive person?
MR. LILLYs

7

It is impossible, and quite the

8

contrary, that it is important that they do know about

9

it.

What we don't have — All we had here was the same

10

board saw the same inmate twice, and this is the same

11

board that saw many inmates probably more than once, two

12

or three times, maybe even longer over a period of time,

13

and that in itself is not partiality as defined by our

14

rules.

15

They are not a charging body or anything of that sort.

16

They did not initiate him coming before it.

Now, the right to due process appears to arise

17

pursuant to this Court's previous opinions either from

18

the Constitution itself or from state law.

19

submit for the reasons previously stated in our briefs

20

that there is no constitutional right not to be

21

transferred interstate.

Now, we

But I still think that there is

23

some problem with the way you state the thing, and maybe

24

the fault isn't yours, but somewhere else down there.

25

Maybe the fault is mine.

But I presume that even though

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

there is not any right to be free of an int erstate

2

transfer, that is, the fact you are being t ransferred by

before you are transferred, and the -- it d oesn * t say

7

MR. LILLY*

8

QUESTION:

9

That’s right.
It doesn’t require any finding of

fact or anything like that.

10

SR. LILLY:

11

QUESTION:

No.
But nonetheless, a hearing is

12

required, and you have a right to appear before them.

13

And if you could show that the board was in fact biased,

14

that is — take an extreme case — that the prison

15

administrator had paid one of the members of the board

16

5100 to decide — to vote to transfer this person, would

17

you say that didn’t raise any constitutional claim?
MR. LILLY;

18

That presents an entirely

19

different situation, but — and it may have some

20

constitutional implications where you have that kind of

21

activity.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION;

Well, I think what you are really

arguing is that there wasn’t bias here.
MR. LILLY:

Oh, I don’t believe there is bias

at all, but I don’t believe that every single violation

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of a state regulation implicates some constitutional

2

right.
QUESTION!

3

No.

I think the decisions of this

4

Court suppoct you in that, but I think, if you have a —

5

you can have a constitutionally biased finder of fact

6

that passes on non-constitutional questions, and you

7

nonetheless might have a constitutional issue.

MR. LILLY;

They may.

There is no --

That wouldn't involve any —

19

It would not implicate a liberty interest, which

If it doesn't implicate a liberty

21

I mean, if you are not depriving the man of liberty, he

22

is not entitled to due process, is he?

23

QUESTION;

It is a liberty interest under

24

state law, I said, but it might implicate a liberty

QUESTIONS

5

That isn't the claim here.
I guess the claim in this case is

that they failed to follow state law.
MR. LILLY*

6

They violated the state law that

7

was provided, and I might say before I reserve the rest

8

of my time that this rule and regulation was not adopted

9

pursuant to the Hawaii Administrative Procedures Act, as

10

claimed in the brief for the Respondent.

11

Administrative Procedures Act under Tai v. Chang, which

12

is cited in the Lono versus Ariyoshi opinion, is

specifically exempted because the rules and regulations

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT GILBERT JOHNSTON,
MR. JOHNSTON;

19

He is

ESQ.

Your Honor, I believe under

20

Vitek we could establish a liberty interest under the

21

change in conditions.

22

in conditions in a transfer from Hawaii to the

23

mainland .

24
25

QUESTION;

There are very substantial change

Were there any regulations or any

controlling state law in Vitek?

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. JOHNSTON:

In Vitek, you have a two-prong

2

approach, as I understand it.

The first prong addresses

3

the question of the statutes.

The second prong

4

addresses the question of the residuum of liberty that a

5

person retains which would preclude a transfer from the

6

-- from the prison, the mental hospital without some due

7

process.

8
9

QUESTION;

Would you not think there is some

difference between being transferred from an institution

10

of pure confinement, that is, a prison, and to a mental

11

institution, different from being transferred from one

12

classification of prison to another?

13

MR. JOHNSTON:

There would be a difference on

14

that, Your Honor.

15

would submit that it is officially analogous.

16
17
18

QUESTION;

There is no doubt about that.

Rut I

Vitek didn't rest just on the

substantiality of the change of conditions, did it?
MR. JOHNSTON:

Not entirely, Your Honor, but I

19

believe the precise language is that there was a

20

qualitative change in the conditions of confinement not

21

substantiated by the terms of the sentence.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

But those words, that language must

be read in the context of the facts of the case.
MR. JOHNSTON:

Yes, Your Honor, it must, but I

think that this case is sufficiently analogous, because

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

I would submit that a transfer of a person such as

2

Wakinekona from Hawaii under the circumstances he was

3

transferred to the mainland indeed raises the same kind

4

of liberty interest that is raised in Vitek on the

5

transfer from the penal institution to the mental

6

hospital.

7

QUESTIONS

Suppose Hawaii had another -- I

8

don't know how -- what's the sweep of the islands.

9

many miles is it, 500, or 300, or what?

10
11
12

MR. JOHNSTON:

Hew

I would say about 350

diagonally.
QUESTION:

Well,

let's assume that the only

13

maximum prison was 300 miles away from Honolulu, and he

14

was — Would you say that the same constitutional

15

factors were raised if he was transferred to the only

16

maximum security institution available 350 miles away?

17

MR. JOHNSTON:

That would raise a very

18

difficult question, Your Honor, and I am not sure that I

19

could justify a change of that distance.

20

QUESTION:

It would be not as difficult, but

21

it would be certainly difficult for family to make

22

visits, would it not, 350 miles?

23

MR. JOHNSTON:

Yes, it would, if he were to be

24

transferred to a different island entirely, because he

25

would still have the problem of interisland or

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

intercounty transport for the family to visit him,

2

unless he had family on the island that it was on.

3

However, I would just say, if I may, Your

4

Honor, that my recollection of the time was that there

5

was another facility called Halava, which was

6

approximately 15 minutes from the Hawaii State Prison

7

located in Kalihi, just outside of Honolulu.

8

believe that there were people in that place, and I do

9

believe that we can find references to Halava in the

10
11

Now, I do

record.
But I would like to clear up one thing right

12

away, if I may, because there have been several

13

questions on this point, and that is the question of the

14

record on the impartiality of this particular tribunal.

15

Contrary to Mr. Lilly's position, I believe that the

16

complaint that was filed with the supporting TBO to stop

17

the transfer of Wakinekona raised questions that went

18

beyond the mere violation of the regulations, and

19

indeed, though I didn’t believe in view of the court's

20

ruling below that that question was really before the

21

Court, I can refer the Court to the record at Pages 394

22

and also at Page 443 and 444, in which there are

23

definitely questions of personal animosity raised

24

regarding this particular tribunal as to Wakinekona.

25

QUESTION;

But that isn't the basis on which

QUESTION:

We would certainly leave.that open

in any decision we rendered, I think..

3

NR. JOHNSTON:

Yes, and I would think that it

4

would be appropriate, if there is a liberty interest

5

here, to remand for that specific issue, because there

6

is indeed a jury asked for in this action as to the

7

facts, and

a question of fact as to that point.

QUESTION:

The court of appeals hasn’t decided

a question which he raised.
MR. JOHNSTON:

Is that your basis?

It was raised in the trial

court, and the trial court didn’t address it, and

13

therefore the court of appeals didn't address it.

And if I may take another step back along the

15

line, Justice O’Connor, the question of the rules goes

beyond merely Rule 4.

18

it is the statutory scheme that we should be addressina

19

in this matter.

20

We claim there is a statutory

Now --

QUESTION:

Well, to that extent, and to the

21

extent of a statutory scheme or, you know, things

22

peculiar to the Hawaii system that courts not in Hawaii

23

might not be familiar with, I should think the best

24

authority on that is the Supreme Court of Hawaii, and

25

they have spoken on the question, haven’t they?

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. JOHNSTON;

1

Your Honor, in that regard, the

2

Lono case addressed only Rule 4, because that apparently

3

was all that was presented to it, rather than

4

considering the other rules that should be read in

5

con junction.
QUESTION;

6

Well, you say should be read in

7

conjunction.

8

to read Rule 4 by itself, I presume it thought that the

9

other rules didn’t have to be read in conjunction with

If the Supreme Court of Hawaii was willing

o

10

it.
MR. JOHNSTON;

11

I would submit that perhaps

12

counsel didn't present the other rules to the court, and

13

that could well explain what happened.
I would also submit that in view of this

14
15

Court’s recent ruling in Logan versus Zimmerman Brush,

16

that this Court indeed does have the power, if not the

17

duty, to address this particular issue, regardless of

18

the Lono decision.
QUESTION;

19

How are Rules 3 and 5 involved in

20

this case? I thought Pule 3 had to dc with the

21

adjustment process to punish a prisoner for some

22

violation while incarcerated, and that Rule 5 had to do

23

with legal counsel, and I did not understand that either

24

of those rules was implicated in the allegations of the

25

complaint.

MB. JOHNSTON;

1

If I may, the -- looking at the

circumstances in which an inmate is entitled to have a

The other is the

and part of the argument is, if you read these

7
8

rules as a whole, it seems somewhat inconceivable to us

9

that prison authorities who promulgated these rules

10

approved by the Attorney General and by the Lieutenant

11

Governor at that time would give a person such as

12

Wakinekona a right to counsel in these four situations,

13

one of which, and these are the only four situations you

14

are entitled to lawyers in these hearings, one of which

15

involves an interstate transfer.

the consequences of an interstate transfer are

significant and important, that doesn’t answer the

question, does it?

will it?

7

That alone won't resolve the issue,

No, I think we have to look to

the rules and see what has occurred in the context of

because you do have that provision.

I am afraid that that is exactly what I am asking you to

MR. JOHNSTON:

I am suggesting that in

situation among the questions of distance is also the

consideration that Wakinekona, if in Hawaii, would have

QUESTION:

Do you suggest that is a

constitutional factor?
MR. JOHNSTON:

I am suggesting the total

14

impact of all these factors I am addressing raises a

15

liberty interest which gives Wakinekona an entitlement

16

to a due process hearing which would basically in any

17

prison situation include an impartial or a fair

18

tribunal, because we don't have many of the other

19

accoutrements of due process in prison hearings.

20

Understandably so, but — so that that becomes the core

21

question of due process in any prison hearing, a fair

22

tribunal, because you really are not allowed to address

QUESTION:

Mr. Johnston, you don't need to

2

show the deprivation of a constitutionally protected

3

liberty interest in order to show that you may be

4

entitled to an unbiased tribunal, do you?

5

MR. JOHNSTON:

I would think that you are

6

entitled as a matter of course to an unbiased tribunal.

7

However, the way the lower court ruled on it, as I

8

understand it, they felt that there had to be a liberty

9

interest to entitle you to any due process hearing

10

11

whatsoever.
QUESTION:

I think the Ninth Circuit's opinion

12

has really balled up this whole thing, if you will

13

pardon me for saying so, because I think that it is very

14

indistinct just what the parties are arguing about.

15

you concede that you would have to show a protected

biased tribunal?

MR. JOHNSTON:

Well, yes. Your Honor.

We do

10

believe that the record does reveal that, and we did, by

animosity in the lower court.

QUESTION:

That claim, that is not on the —

14

on a claim that the due process clause of the federal

15

constitution has been violated because you have been

16

deprived of your life, your liberty, or your property,

17

and probably your liberty, without due process of law.

18

MR. JOHNSTON:

That is the only thing I think

19

Mr. Wakinekona can claim here, and that he has indeed

20

been deprived of his liberty because there was an

21

interest where he should be entitled to somebody that

22

made this decision.

MR ..JOHNSTON;

I would agree that — if the

Court agrees that Wakinekona has an interest that

14

entitles him to a due process hearing, that that matter

15

should be remanded back down to the federal district

16

court of Hawaii to resolve that matter, and then perhaps

17

we could ignore the Ninth Circuit opinion, if it is

18

going to cause the grief that it seems to be causing.

19

QUESTION;

I may have spoken too hastily.

20

Assume that you have the kind of situation in Heachum

21

against Fano, where the court says that although you may

22

have — there may have been a process for some sort of a

23

hearing, nonetheless there was no substantive standard,

24

no deprivation of any liberty interest, just in the

25

transfer from one prison within a state to the other.

Now, supposing you end up coupling that -- the

allegation that would lose under Meachum against Fano

with an allegation that the prison administrator had to

make some sort of a finding was constitutionally biased

5

against you.

question is, Fano would insist that there be a liberty

Well, in order to guarantee an

15

unbiased tribunal it would be a constitutional

16

dimension.
MR. JOHNSTON;

17

I would believe that Fano would

take that position, but, Your Honor, I think that Fano

has been rather severely cut back by the case of Vitek,

I am suggesting that if they wish to transfer

should require under the second point in Vitek a due

MR. LILLY;

One of the reasons why prisons

20

traditionally have these kinds of procedures is because

21

they find inmate frustrations and tensions lowered when

22

they have some kind of input.

23

without any reasons, without any input, without any

24

25

rules like this to involve inmates in it, and they feel

QUESTION;

What if you read the Ninth Circuit

opinion as resting on a decision that he had a right to

18

a hearing under state law, and surely that if he had a

right to a hearing, he ought to have a right to a

22

24
