ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK GREENBERG, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF NAACP LEGAL DEFENSE

AND EDUCATIONAL FUND,

INC.,

AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. GREENBERG;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11

please the Court, I shall argue first as a friend of the

12

Court on the issue of standards for granting stays of

13

execution on denials of petitions for writ of habeas

14

corpus in capital case, and Mr. Gray shall argue for the

15

Petitioner on the merits of the case with regard to the

16

admissibility of the psychiatric testimony.

17

I would first like to commence with a brief

18

review of the chronology of the case, because it bears

19

upon an important issue with regard to the stay, and

20

that is whether counsel acted diligently or dilatorily.

21

The Petitioner in this case, Thomas Barefoot,

22

was convicted in November,

1978, of homicide, and he

23

litigated his case in the state courts on direct review,

24

and then to this Court, and then on state

25

post-conviction relief for approximately three years,

1

and on October 6th,

1981, he completed his proceedings

2

in the state system, and less -- approximately a week

3

later, on October 14th, he filed his case in the United

4

States District Court.
That case was resolved a year later in the

5

6

District Court on November,

7

the District Court granted a certificate of probable

8

cause and permission to proceed in forma pauperis, and

9

on December 4th it vacated a stay which it had

10

1982, and on December 3rd,

theretofore granted.

11

Shortly thereafter, on December --

12

QUESTION;

13

Hr. Greenberg, do those two actions

strike you as being at all inconsistent?
HR. GREENBERG;

14

Yes.

On December 20th, the

15

District Court set the date of execution for January

16

25th, 1983.
Texas has a doctrine which does not permit

17
18

litigation in its state courts as long as proceedings

19

are pending in the federal courts, and some newly

20

discovered evidence appeared, as well as an additional

21

state court matter, which had not been exhausted, and so

22

Mr. Gray went back into the state courts on December

23

20th on state habeas corpus which was denied on December

24

21st.

25

However, he was not notified of this denial

1

until January 7th.

A week thereafter, he filed his

2

petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the

3

Fifth Circuit, on January 14th.

4

He received a telephone call on January 17th

5

telling him to appear for a hearing on the application

6

for stay on January 19th.

7

January 19th.

8

informed him that Judge Brown was ill and Judge Bandall

9

was substituting for Judge Brown, and it was stated in

He appeared in court on

The panel which had Judge-Brown on it

10

open court that Judge Randall had showed up at the last

11

moment, didn't know anything at all about the case.

12

The record on the -- of the state court

13

proceedings had not yet been filed in federal court.

14

The record of the federal habeas court proceedings was

15

just then filed.

16

was turned over to the court saying that the American

17

Psychiatric Association desired to file a friend of the

18

court brief on the important issue of the admissibility

19

and the significance of the psychiatrict testimony in

20

this case, which was based upon a respons to a

21

hypothetical question.

22

There was a letter from counsel which

The hearing on the stay was concluded.

23

Twenty-four hours later, a

16-page opinion was issued

24

denying the stay and setting forth as a standard for

25

granting a denial of stay whether or not Petitioner had

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

established a substantial likelihood of success on the

2

merits.

3

In essence, this —

4

QUESTION;

I have a little difficulty, Mr.

5

Greenberg, tracking the matter of the substitution of

6

the judge.

How is that relevant to any issue here?
MR. GREENBERG;

7

Such preparation as the judge

8

might have been able to make even on that short notice

9

was not possible for Judge Randall, who just showed up

10

at the last moment, certainly through not fault of her

11

own .
QUESTION;

12

Well, you must be aware that, for

13

example, one Justice of this Court for many years came

14

on the bench without knowing anything but the name of

15

the case, and did so deliberately.

16

disqualifies a judge from participating?
MR. GREENBERG:

17

You suggest that

No, I certainly was not

18

suggesting it was a disqualification, but certainly it

19

was an indication of not adequate opportunity for study

20

and reflection on a matter that was complex and

21

difficult.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Eut a matter that had been through

the state court systems up to that time.
MR. GREENBERG:

The matter had been through

the state court system, but Petitioner had a

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Congressionally mandated statutory right to federal

2

habeas corpus review of his constitutional claims in the

3

federal courts and had not yet had that.

4

Now, our brief and others argue that a stay

5

should be granted on appeal from appeal from denial of a

6

first application, I must stress, a first application

7

for writ of habeas corpus whenever petitioner presents

8

issue that are not frivolous or has a certificate of

9

probable cause.

10

But there are additional reasons which we

11

would like to submit on this argument based on policy

12

why Petitioner’s first application should receive the

13

ordinary consideration afforded non-death sentence

14

prisoners who assert they have been denied

15

constitutional rights without having their cases mooted

16

by execution.

17

Those --

QUESTIONS

Nr. Greenberg, I know you stress

18

first application, but there just isn't anything in the

19

rules or the statute that refer to the first

20

application, and I --

21

22

NR. GREENBEPGs

refers to second application, and that is --

23

QUESTIONS

24

NR. GREENBERG;

25

But there is something that

-- distinguish.
There is something that refers

to second application, and that is the Rule 9(b) of the

7

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

rules governing federal habeas corpus

2

Petitioner is abusing the writ --

3

QUESTION;

If the

But nothing as far as the rules

4

concerning the stay are concerned that would limit it to

5

a first application.

6

MB. GREENBERG;

Well, but he is not going to

7

have — he is not going to have his hearing unless he

8

gets a stay, because he will be executed before his case

9

has been heard on the merits, so the two are intimately

10
11

involved one with another.
QUESTION;

Well, but I think we have to be

12

conscious of the fact that there are successive

13

petitions typically filed, and we will have to address

14

this for successive petitions.

15

MR. GREENBERG;

I do not for a moment suggest

16

that a successive petition requires the same

17

consideration that an initial petition requires,

18

although some successive petitions have succeeded in the

19

Courts of Appeals, and indeed in this Court, so they are

20

not all to be viewed as automatically --

21

QUESTION:

Well, then, how would you

22

distinguish them, as opposed to just saying you don't

23

see why one would have to be treated the same as the

24

other for stay purposes?

25

MR. GREENBERG:

I think a successive petition

8

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

deserves much more cursory treatment.

2

petition merits serious consideration.

3

petitions have succeeded at the rate of almost 70 to 80

4

percent in the courts of appeals.

5

frivolous petitions.

6

An initial
These initial

These are not

I would like to just identify three policy

7

considerations that support the statutory argument made

in the various briefs.

9

defendant to have his constitutional claims fairly

The first is the interest of the

10

considered in the same manner as the claims of an

11

ordinary embezzler or petty theif.

12

The second is the interest of the states in

13

maintaining an effective system of criminal justice, and

14

the third is the interest of this Court in not only

15

doing justice to capital defendants but the total run of

16

business of the federal courts.

17

As to the defendants in the capital cases,

18

they are mostly represented by volunteer counsel, public

19

defenders, a few civil rights organizations, such as the

20

one for which I work, which has three or four lawyers

21

working on such cases.

22

capacity of lawyers to present them fairly and

23

completely is now -- we have now gone totally beyond

24

that, and if the courts obtain the assistance they need,

25

at a minimum, there should be the time for the ordinary

As far as the interests of the states are

that people who commit homicides are being executed.

11

there is a deterrent effect arising from executions,

12

that deterrent effect will take place.

If

13

3o far as the interest of the federal

14

judiciary is concerned, this Court and other courts have

15

heavy dockets of many different kinds of cases.

16

counsel in those cases and the parties in those cases

17

cannot have their cases fairly heard if they must

18

operate on a crash schedule, as Mr. Gray had to operate

19

in this case, compiling a complex record in three days,

20

the record of the trial and the record of the habeas

21

corpus proceeding not being presented until one before

22

the hearing and the other after the hearing, a difficult

23

issue requiring medical judgments, which was covered in

24

a brief by the American Psychiatric Association, which

25

finally was filed in this Court.

1

2

consideration of the stay into the consideration of the

3

merits, which is what, of course, happens, because

4

otherwise the case is mooted out by the execution of the

5

defendant before he has a hearing on the merits, does

6

not help the federal courts, does not help criminal

7

justice, and certainly is to the detriment of the

8

defendant.
We urge upon this Court a standard which is

9

10

that in cases of a first application for a petition of

11

writ of habeas corpus, that application be considered in

12

the ordinary course of events, which may take four to

13

six months, instead of the crash basis, which takes four

14

to six weeks, and that the interests of — all the

15

various interests involved will be well served and no

16

interest involved will be disserved by such a

17

procedure.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. GRAY, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GRAY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

23

please the Court, the state in this case put on at the

24

guilt stage of the trial -- Texas has a bifurcated

25

procedure in capital cases — put on all of the evidence

questions to two psychiatrists.

4

5

hearing, prior convictions for two firearm cases and

6

three drug-related cases.

They put on evidence of

At the punishment hearing, they put

They put on testimony at the guilt stage of

7

8

the trial about — at least they introduced the

9

testimony of some charges in New Mexico involving rape

10

and kidnapping of a child under

13.

At the punishment

11

stage, they put on evidence of the defendant’s bad

12

reputation.

13

who had handled the Petitioner on these drug-related

14

cases, on the firearm cases, and on no cases relating to

15

violent crimes.

This testimony came in from police officers

The prosecutor then incorporated all of the

16
17

evidence that had already been heard by the jury in the

18

hypothetical questions to two psychiatrists, Dr.

19

Grigson, who has represented the state in probably 75 to

20

100 cases, and Dr. Holbrook, who is now deceased.

21

of these psychiatrists --

22

QUESTION;

Is now deceased, did you say?

23

MR. GRAY;

Yes, Your Honor.

24
25

Both

He committed

suicide.
The critical nature of this type of testimony

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

goes to the very heart of the Texas procedure, because

2

the issue of whether a defendant lives or dies is based

3

upon one fact issue, and that is whether in the opinion

4

of the jury he will constitute a future danger to

5

society.

6

Dr. Grigson testified in answer to this

7

hypothetical question that it was 100 percent and

8

absolute, in his -- he didn't even say in his opinion.

9

He just said 100 percent and absolute that this

10

defendant would constitute a continuing danger to

11

society.

12

Dr. Holbrook, was almost as emphatic.
That removes any discretion that the jury that

13

heard this case may have had in determining whether Mr.

14

Barefoot lived or died.

15
16

QUESTION:

Well, the jury could disbelieve the

testimony, could they not?
MR. GRAY:

17

They -- well, not under the —

18

there is nothing a defendant can present under the Texas

19

procedure in mitigation of punishment unless it bears

20

directly on future dangerousness, and even then, when he

21

introduces such evidence, there are no provisions

22

whatsoever in the Texas law that the jury be instructed

23

to consider that mitigating evidence or to balance the

24

mitigating evidence against the aggravating facts of the

25

case.

5

MR. GRAY;

Well --

6

QUESTION;

Could you or could you not?

7

MR. GRAY;

You could not do it and protect a

8

defendant's constitutional rights.

There is no way it

9

can be done, because the reliable and ethical

10

psychiatric pratitioners will not give such testimony

11

and will not -QUESTION:

MR. GRAY;

14

All right.

The lawyers in this

15

case tried to cross examine Dr. Grigson.

16

didn't recognize any of these authorities from the

17

American Psychiatric Association or any other

18

practitioners.
QUESTION:

20

He said he

Can't you argue that fact to the

jury as a reason for not crediting his testimony?

You can argue it, but —

Well, you said you couldn't argue

I thought you said you couldn't.
MR. GRAY:

Well, no, you can't -- you can't

present any mitigating evidence, and if you bring on —

He can't be, because the studies have shown that they

Where does Dr. Grigson practice?

QUESTIONS

Has the medical association ever

zeroed in on him?
MR. GRAYs

I am not sure about that.

But he,

15

as this Court knows, has testified in an inordinate

number of capital cases, always for the state, and his

17

opinions are always the same, whether he has examined

the people or not.

out on cross examination and let the jury know that.

MR. GRAYs

Sure, you could do that.

QUESTION:

And you do that, suppose.

23

MR. GRAYs

Absolutely, but that's just like

admitting an involuntary confession and telling the jury

not to consider it.

this testimony even to non-dangerousness would be
unreliable and should not be admissible, but I am saying

be laid before the fact-finders, the jurors, both by
cross examination and by other experts.
HR. GRAY;

It can be. It does not work in

these cases.

Well, do you conclude from that or

do you suggest we conclude from that that therefore it
is an unconstitutional practice because it isn't
successful?
MR. GRAY;

I'm not saying that. Your Honor.

I'm saying -- well, actually, in Eddings, this Court
examined some psychiatric testimony where the
psychiatrist had examined Eddings for about an hour, and
drew some ieterminist conclusions from that examination,
and I believe you, Judge Purger, Chief Justice, said
that that was fantastic testimony, or something like
that, and you —

Yes, there have been a number of

think that's the thrust of the American Psychiatric

Association's brief also.
QUESTION:

3

In other words, a psychiatrist is

4

to be permitted to testify after a person has been found

5

not guilty by reason of insanity in a murder case, and

6

goes to St. Elizabeth Hospital, and you would say it is

7

all right for the psychiatrist then to testify 60 or 90

8

days later that his release will not endanger the

9

community ?

10

HR. GRAY:

Yes, and that's because in those

11

cases they are only making short-range predictions of

12

dangerousness.

13

about long-range predictions.

14

QUESTION:

In a capital murder case, we are talking

Well, it isn't — if you are going

15

to release them, it isn't very short range.

If it is

just going to be testimony that he is no longer

HR. GRAY:

But the fallacy --

the standards for a civil commitment is whether a person

21

is dangerous to himself or others.

22

HR. GRAY:

1

think we can all agree that the more than 1,100 persons

2

now on death row represents a national tragedy, but it

3

is a national tragedy that is exacerbated by the fact

that they sit there apparently interminably while their

cases are litigated year after year in the appellate

courts.
I think that we can all agree that the effects

8

of this delay are terrible.

They erode the public faith

9

in the judiciary, promote the view that the law cannot

10

be carried out, destroy whatever deterrent effect the

11

death penalty would otherwise have, makes proof of

12

claims harder if retrials are necessary, often make

13

retrials impossible, and I think that we also agree that

14

the delays are very unfair to those who are

15

unconstitutionally confined upon death row, who after

16

interminable years on death row finally reach an

that there is only an inconsistency between the fact

Therefore, he did not stay the

So he thought -- the District Judge

thought the standard for granting or vacating a stay was

thing, and just as the Fifth Circuit judges have thought

the same thing and indeed said the same thing.

QUESTION:

Does that mean that he should not

have issued a certificate of probable cause?
MR. BECKER:

No, sir.

We have contended that

the hypothetical question issue is not frivolous, but as

we argued in the Fifth Circuit, it borders upon the

thought, some minimal reflection.

That is, we have been unwilling to say it is
It is one that bears some

But upon making that reflection, every judge

5

that has considered it, which at this point includes 32

6

by my count, has conclued that the issue is without

merit, and is totally without merit.

8

though it may not be frivolous, it is without substance,

9

and there are a large number of issues in these cases

10

Therefore, even

that will fall within that category.
QUESTIONi

11

Well, it just seems so illogical to

12

have a different standard for when you issue a

14

just don't see how you would argue for a different

there are different — there are different things

to what he needs in order to appeal, but the granting of

4

the stay is in effect the granting of an injunction

5

against a state process, a state procedure that has been

6

supported by lengthy judicial proceedings, and I think

7

that the granting of an injunction under those

8

circumstances, whether it is under Pule 8 or Section

9

2251, involves important comity interests.

The certificate of probable cause is related

It involves

10

calling a halt to the state court proceedings, and I

think that in order to do that, the Petitioner has a

12

higher burden properly to fulfill than the mere burden

that he has to gain a certificate of probable cause to

14

appeal within the federal system something that involves

15

no state interest at all.

So, although it may be inconsistent, I think
that there are good reasons for it.

They did summarily deal with the

no semblance of merit to any of the issues.

MR. PECKER;

That's correct.

They did not use

the word "frivolous" probably because they didn't want

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS M. BECKER, ESQ.,

ON EEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BECKERi

6

Your Honors, I have attempted to

7

reduce my argument upon the stay question to a

8

syllogism.

9

why the standards for granting a certificate of probable

First, that it is perfectly understandable

10

cause and a stay pending appeal are different.

11

certificate of probable cause to the appeal involves an

12

internal matter of federal jurisdiction with no

13

particular concern for the state.

14

A

The granting of a stay pending an appeal

15

involves in effect an injunction against the state court

16

proceedings and, we argue, justifies the higher standard

The standard for a certificate of probable

cause is an absence of frivolity of at least one issue,

20

and of the stay, that there be a substantial question.

21

The opinion of the District Court in this case

22

illustrates the District Court’s painstaking attempt to

23

distinguish between those issues that were frivolous,

24

some of which were labeled as frivolous in his opinion,

25

and others, like the psychiatric issue, at Page 12 of

With respect to the issue of the hypothetical

psychiatric testimony, I think that what the plaintiff

does ask the Court in effect to do is to overrule Jurek,

7

something that is obviously not before the Court, and

8

that is the import of his argument, because in Jurek if

9

appropriate one to decide the question of life or death,

I think that Petitioner’s argument that there

context is plainly without merit.
