Court, in this case Idaho seeks apportionment of the

The only significant harvest was by the

At that time, even though there

10

were not enough fish to meet the escapement that the

11

defendants had agreed on with the Indians in the

12

five-year plan, the defendants conducted a downstream

harvest, and during that year they took 78 percent of

14

the harvest of spring Chinook, and that was during the

15

five-year period that the Master actually did consider.

years, but they were harvests that were conducted in the

QUESTION;

5

And it was- apparent to the Indians

What kind of a formula is used to

protect the Indian rights?

6

MR. JONES;

In the Sorhappy case, the Federal

7

District Court said that the Indians were to get 50

8

percent of the harvestable surplus.

9

agreed on a five-year plan, starting in

Then the parties
1977 — it just

10

terminated last year -- whereby an escapement of 120,000

11

fish over Bonneville was agreed on.

12

then to get a certain amount, and it is in the formula

13

in the five-year plan for ceremonial and subsistence

14

fishers.
QUESTION;

15
16

The Indians were

Is it in the nature of an

escapement number?
MR. JONES;

17

It is after the escapement is

18

met.

19

The Indians get 40 percent above the escapement and

20

above the ceremonial fishery. The defendants get 60

21

percent.

22

fair to all parties, and that is what we are basically

23

after here.

So it is on a percentage basis.

And that is

I would like to give you a brief background

Then the fish are shared on a percentage basis.

QUESTION*

What is the formula that you think

will protect Idaho's interests?

3

NR. JONES*

The formula that we have laid out

4

is essentially at Pages 81 and 82 of our brief, and we

5

are saying that you go one step beyond the five-year

6

plan, and that you take the 60 percent of the non-treaty

7

fishery and slice off an allocation for Idaho.

8

saying that with regard —

9

QUESTION*

10

NR. JONES*

We are

An allocation not yet determined?
Not yet determined.

What we are

11

suggesting is that of that 60 percent, you use existing

12

methodology and formulas to find out how much Idaho

13

contributed.

14

that 60 percent, then you take that 40 percent and give

15

Idaho 40 percent of it and give the defendant 60

16

percent.

fish that we contribute.

If Idaho contributed, say, 40 percent to

QUESTION*

But didn't the Master say you could

not tell how many Idaho had contributed?
MR. JONES*

The Master indicated that, but the

21

unrebutted testimony by Idaho's experts was that you

22

could determine it, and that unrebutted testimony was

23

based on formulas that the defendants have devised.

24

apparently the Master did not understand those formulas,

25

but we are willing to live with them.

Wall, General. Jones, you are not

2

suggesting the Master isn't entitled to disbelieve

3

testimony aven though it is unrebutted, are you?

m

MR» JONES;

4

Well, we are saying that if it is

5

not inherently incredible, if it is not contradicted, if

6

people don't punch holes on it, if it is not inherently

7

incredible, he has to live with it, we think,
QUESTION;

8
9

What if the Master concluded that

it is simply an unknowable factor, and therefore it

10

wouldn't be a matter of impugning the credibility or

11

integrity of the witness, but simply a conclusion that

12

the witness was in outer space in terms of giving an

13

opinion ?

14

MR. JONES;

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think

15

that he did not say it was unknowable, and possibly it

16

could be, but historically the runs have been 50 percent

17

contributed by Idaho, and that is recognized by the

18

experts for Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, and fish

19

counts are kept, so that you can find out certainly a

20

year afterwards what the run was, and what —

QUESTION;

Aren't you including in Idaho's

contribution the hatchery fish?
MR. JONES;

We include hatchery fish in all

the calculations.
QUESTION;

Why do you assign those hatcheries

to Idaho?

2

MR. JONES;

3

QUESTION;

4

to Idaho as a state?

5

MR. JONES;

Pardon?
Why do you assign those hatcheries

Well, because this Court,

I

6

believe, recognized in the Washington fishing vessel

7

case — I believe it was that case — that hatcheries

8

are there primarily to compensate for damages caused by

9

the dams, and the principle has been recognized with

10

respect to the Indians, and it should be recognized with

11

respect to us, and those hatcheries are apportioned,

12

like under the Lower Snake Compensation Plan, those

13

hatcheries are apportioned to compensate, they are

14

distributed to compensate for the damages that were

15

caused by the dams.

16
17
18
19

We didn't put the dams there.

We didn’t put

those dams there that caused our fish to die.

You didn't put all the hatcheries

there, either.

How many of the fish that you claim

Idaho is supplying are hatchery fish?

3

MR. JONES;

Presently, about 30 to 50 percent

of the spring Chinook in the runs are hatchery fish.

5

The rest are wild fish.

6

the steelhead are hatchery fish.

interesting that when we had seven, dams on line in the

2

system, when the mortality rates had been fairly well

3

established at about two fish for each one that reached

4

Idaho through the entire system, so you lose a maximum

5

of one fish as they are coming up the river for one that

you get, at a time when we had that situation existing

And that is the one closest to

Idaho, isn’t it?
HR. JONESs

That’s the Lower Granite Dam.

It

did not add significantly to the mortality, because

measures were incorporated in that dam to make sure that

That has bean the sticking point, and that is

really what the problem is with the narrow constrained

time frame that the Waster used.

where we were suffering yet from overfishing by the

And it is your position that it is

better to prevent people downstream from catching those

basically it?

And it should be pointed out that in 1974,

7

just one year before the period that the Master thought

8

was important, they fished against the recommendations

of the biologists.

The biologists said, we aren't going

10

to have a fishable run, a harvestable run, but they

11

fished anyway, and they seriously impacted that run.

12

The escapement over Bonneville was almost half what it

13

should have been.

It was 68,000 and some odd fish.

And that had impact.

14

When you overfish in one

have been additional fish available in 1968 which would

have been four-year-olds out of the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF

Mr. Mackie.

EDWARD B. MACKIE, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF DEFENDANT WASHINGTON
MR. MACKIE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19

please the Court, the starting position that the state

20

of Idaho takes is to assert that the Master in some way

21

restricted the record they had an opportunity to make.

22

That assertion is simply false.

23

restrict the record which the plaintiffs had an

24

opportunity to make in this suit.

25

and statistics indicates run sizes from 1956 on.

The Master’s report
The

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

record has material reflecting runs that are prior to

2

1956.

3

What the Master did was, having heard the

4

testimony on the question of indispensability, which

5

resulted in the report, and then subsequently when the

6

matter was remanded to the Master for proceeding upon

7

the merits, took, the testimony, the exhibits, and the

8

arguments, and from that looked at the totality and

9

could see the marked changes that have occurred in the

10

Columbia River and Snake system as a result of the dams

11

and the impact on the fishery, and having that knowledge

12

before him, indicated that if the court was to prescribe

13

a decree to address an allocation as sought by Idaho,

14

one should look at what the realities of life are now,

15

to address that decree, rather than to address a decree

16

on the basis of what may have occurred in the 1940’s,

17

fifties, or sixties.

18
19
20

So, the record is in fact full.

It is not

restricted to the most recent period.
On the presentation of argument for the

21

indispensability question, one of the contentions for

22

indispensability was that most of these dams on this

23

system are owned and operated by the federal government

24

or licensees of the federal government, and therefore

25

the United States for that reason was an indispensable

1

party, because its control of the flow of water through

2

those iams and the turbines as contrasted with spill had
*»

3
4

a direct impact on the availability of fish.
Idaho's response was that they accept the

5

dams, they accept the loss, and therefore the United

6

States was not indispensable upon that theory.

7

Court in the opinion remanding it back to the Master

8

acknowledged that position taken by Idaho.
Sow, it turns back to this Court.

This

They are

10

taking the posture that one should in some way apportion

11

the loss that occurs by upstream passage of the fish

12

rather than Idaho being the area where the fishery takes

13

place after the fish have gone through eight dams on its

14

upward matter.

15

QUESTION;

Mr. Mackie, do you concede that

16

Idaho is entitled under some theory to an equitable

17

share of the fish?

18

MR. MACKIE;

Your Honor, our position on that

1

is that Idaho's claim is novel, it is unique, it has no

20

precedent in terms -- in any case law nor any that they

21

could develop for having "a right’* here at all.

22

Court has found that the issue is in fact justiciable,

23

so that it can be considered by a court for relief.

24

Me therefore believe that if there is any

25

right, it is an equitable right, and that equitable

2UESTI0N:

Well, do you concede that Idaho has

an equitable right to some share of the fish?

SR. MACKIE:

In terms — I believe that Idaho

could present in an appropriate circumstance a need to

6

have some protection which would give rise —

7

QUESTION*

Well, just in the abstract, does

8

Idaho have an equitable right to a share of anadromous

9

fish?

10

MR. MACKIE*

Your Honor, in the abstract, my

11

response is that the right comes into being because of

12

the need to create it, and therefore if in fact they

13

have demonstrated the need, that gives rise to the

14

equitable right.

15

free-standing, separate, and apart from any —

16

The equitable right does not exist

QUESTION:

Well, as I read your brief, I

17

thought you were saying that fish just weren’t a subject

18

for equitable apportionment, and that the Master was

19

just wrong in saying that Idaho was — did have an

20

equitable right, and if it could prove it up, it would

21

get relief.

22

I thought you were just against that.

MR. MACKIE*

Your Honor, what our position was

23

is that Idaho having failed to prove need for any

24

protection, it is not appropriate therefore to label

25

that they have a right at the outset.

If they —

You don't think our prior opinion

2

precluded the Master — would have precluded the Master

3

from, after hearing the evidence, saying there is not a

right to equitable apportionment?

5

MR. MACKIE*

6

QUESTION*

Yes.

You are —

The case is justiciable.

It is

7

like filing a complaint.

8

but it is justiciable, you might — you might judge it

9

by saying you fail to state a cause of action.
MR. MACKIE*

10

It is certainly justiciable,

Your Honor, the Master addressing

11

that point found that it was inappropriate to dismiss

12

the action without having it proceed to the merits to

13

determine whether there might be a right that would give

14

rise.

suggest that you think every time a person — a state is

10

entitled to equitable apportionment in the abstract,

11

they are also entitled to a decree?

12

-- I mean, I read the Master's finding in this case as

13

being pretty much saying in the abstract they may have

14

some right, but there just isn't any way we could give

15

them relief on these facts.

Couldn't the Master

16

MR. MACXIE:

17

The Master concluded no relief.

18

is that actually when one "says there is a right" the

19

general reaction is, therefore "there should be a

20

remedy," and that when one is looking to the recognition

21

of something which is new and novel, as is here

22

presented, it is prudent to say that we will try to

23

describe what the nature of that may be when there is a

HR. MACKIE:

QUESTION*

That's right, Your Honor.
In that respect, now, we who are

not experienced in water matters may get confused even

about very elementary things, water and fish.

a difference on the right of a state with respect to

8

water and the contents of the water, on terms of

allocation?

10

MR. MACKIE:

Is there

Yes, Your Honor. The first is

11

that in water rights traditionally those adjudications

12

have tried to resolve and harmonize the respective

13

rights held by individuals and entities in varying

14

states.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. MACKIE:

And is that based on need?
That is based historically, when
