ORAL ARGUMENT OF K. MARTIN WORTHY, ESQ.

ON EEHALF OF APPELLANT

7

MR. WORTHY:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question before the Court is whether the

10
11

Tennessee bank tax violates federal law to the extent

12

that it includes interest on the obligations of the

13

federal government and its instrumentalities in the tax

14

base, while excluding interest from similar obligations

15

issued by the state of Tennessee itself.

16

Supreme Court, reversing the chancery court, said no.

17

We think the answer is clearly yes.

The Tennessee

There is no dispute as to the essential

18
19

facts.

In 1977, the Tennessee legislature made

20

inapplicable to banks the existing intangible personal

21

property tax on financial institutions which made no

22

distinction between state and federal obligations.

23

it created instead, in the words of the statute, a

24

subclassification of intangible personal property

25

designated as shares of banks and banking institutions

And

to be taxed at 3 percent on net income of the previous

2

year.

Earnings are required for this purpose to be

computed by including interest on obligations of the

5

federal government and its instrumentalities, and also

6

including interest on obligations of other states, but

8

Tennessee itself.

than an ad valorem tax of 60 percent on the value of the

property of the bank.

11

The tax is an obligation of the bank itself,

12

and is not collectible by either the state or the bank

itself from its stockholders.

QUESTION:

17

Mr. Worthy, do you pay another

MR. WORTHY:

Yes, sir.

There is a -- all

banks and all other corporations are subject

18 . specifically to a Tennessee franchise tax which is
19

imposed specifically on the — to quote from that

20

statute — on the privilege of engaging in business in

21

corporate form in the state.

22

also required to pay an excise tax which is imposed

23

the benefits it receives from doing business in

imposing the bank tax.
Appellant, the Memphis Bank £ Trust Company, a

2
3

state bank,

paid the tax as so imposed under protest for

4

1977 and

5

refund of the tax, contending that collection of the tax

6

violated federal law to the extent that the tax applied

7

to interest earned on obligations of the federal

8

government and federal farm credit agencies, and thereby

9

violated the prohibitions of state taxation contained in

*78, and brought suit in the chancery court for

10

Section 742 of Title 31 of the United States Code, and

11

Sections 2055, 2079 and 2134 of Title XII of the Code,

12

relating to farm credit agencies.

13

stipulated that if such interests were excluded,

14

appellant would have no liability for tax for the years

15

in issue.

It was thereafter

16

Codifying a long line of decisions of this

17

Court, going back to M’Culloch versus Maryland, more

18

than 160 years ago, Section 742 of Title 31 of the Code

19

specifically prohibits every form of state taxation

20

directly or indirectly on interest from federal

21

obligations, except non-discriminatory franchise or

22

other non-property taxes in lieu thereof.

23

The Tennessee tax clearly violates the general

24

prohibition of the statute.

The state claims, however,

25

that the tax fits within the exception for

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

non-discriminatory franchise or other non-property taxes

2

imposed in lieu thereof.

3

not.

4

6

Appellant submits that it does

First of all, it's not a franchise tax or
other non-property tax imposed in lieu thereof.
QUESTION:

Hr. Worthy, is that question to be

7

determined as a matter of federal law, do you think,

8

whether it's a franchise tax within the meaning of

9

Section 742?

10

HR. WORTHY:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, I think it

11

is to be determined as a matter of federal law.

12

obviously, — T think this Court has held that it should

13

look at the effect of the law to determine whether it's

14

a franchise or a property tax.

15

the legislature and the authority under which the

16

legislature acted are prime considerations in

17

determining the nature of the tax.

18

to be resolved by this Court.

19

I have,

Obviously, the intent of

But it is a question

Even if the tax is a franchise tax, we believe

20

that it's clearly discriminatory.

21

that in enacting the bank tax, the Tennessee legislature

22

intended to impose a property tax and not a franchise or

23

similar non-property tax.

24
25

It is quite clear

The preamble to the act imposing the tax
states specifically that the legislature is acting under

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

authority to tax intangible personal property of banks,

2

and to divide intangible personal property into

3

subclassifications.

4

authority or any statement of intent to impose a

5

franchise or privilege tax.

There is no mention of any

QUESTION:

6

So what your argument now is that

7

even if Tennessee obligations were included in the basis

8

of the tax, the tax is not one permitted by the federal

9

sta tute.

HR. WORTHY:

That's correct. Justice White.

of intangible personal property designated as shares of

13

banks to be taxed on the basis of 3 percent of net

14

earnings, with the net tax in no event to be less than

15

16

property of the bank, with a credit for tax paid on its

17

real and personal property.

the act creates a subclassification

§

As I previously indicated, the bank is subject

1
2

to both the regular general Tennessee franchise tax

3

imposed by a different chapter of the Code and to the

4

Tennessee excise tax imposed by a different chapter of

5

the Code.

6

The state nevertheless says that because the

7

bank tax is measured by income, it should be treated as

8

a franchise tax.

9

nature of a tax is not determined by its method of

10

The

calculation.
This Court has many times held that a tax

11

i

This certainly does not follow.

12

imposed as a franchise tax will be treated as a

13

franchise tax even though it is measured by the value of

14

the•property.

15

property tax should be treated as a property tax even

16

though the measure of the value of the property is

17

income.

18

By the same token, a tax imposed as a

It’s long been settled in cases going back to

19

1829 by this Court that federal obligations may not be

20

included in the measure of a state property tax, and

21

this principle is now codified in Section 742 in

22

prohibiting a state property tax in any form which

23

directly or indirectly taxes federal obligations or the

24

interest thereon.

25

For this reason alone, the Tennessee statute

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

should be declared invalid insofar as it requires

2

interest from federal obligations to be included in the

3

tax base.

4

But even if the Tennessee tax were regarded as

5

a franchise tax# it clearly violates federal law because

6

it discriminates against federal obligations by

7

requiring that interest therefrom be taxed while

8

specifically exempting in interest from obligations of

9

the state of Tennessee itself.

10

There have been numerous cases in which this

11

Court has stated that the proper test of whether there

12

is discrimination is simply whether the tax is higher as

13

a result of an investment being made in federal

14

obligations than it would be if a similar investment

15

were made in some other assets.

16

This principle is specifically demonstrated in

17

the Schuylkill case, the first Schuylkill case in 1935,

18

in which Pennsylvania imposed a tax on trust companies

19

on the value of shares represented by investments in

20

government obligations, but exempted from tax such value

21

represented by investments in Tennessee -- excuse me, in

22

Pennsylvania corporations and such other assets as

23

Pennsylvania chose to exempt.

24
25

This Court said it is impossible to avoid the
conclusion that the law discriminates in favor of

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

companies owning stocks already taxed or relieved from

2

taxation by the state, and against those companies

3

amongst whose assets there are United States bonds taxed

4

by reason of ownership of such federal securities.

5

Now, appellees in their brief vigorously

6

criticize Schuylkill contending that it stands alone as

7

authority in support of the bank's position in this

8

case.

9

other cases.

10

Not so.

The principle is well established in

In National Life versus United States in 1928,

11

this Court applied precisely the same principle to a

12

federal attempt to impose a tax on state obligations,

13

invalidating the tax, because it reguired petitioner to

14

pay more upon its taxable income than could have been

15

imposed had its income from state obligations been

16

derived instead from other securities.

17

And the test has been restated many times by

18

the Court as a basis for finding lack of discrimination.

19

For example, in the Home Insurance case in 1890 in

20

upholding a New York tax, this Court emphasized that the

21

tax sustained, and I quote, "would not be affected if

22

the nature of the property in which the whole capital

23

stock is invested were changed and put into real

24

property or bonds of New York or of other states."

25

That is, of course, the reverse of the

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

situation here in that the tax here would be reduced if

2

the investment were shifted from federal to state

3

bonds.

4

Commerce case cited the statute in Weston versus City of

5

Charleston in which federal obligations and most other

6

personal assets, but not state obligations, were taxed

7

as a prime example of discrimination.
The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania more

discrimination against federal obligations, in violation

of the Federal Constitution.

Pennsylvania, like Tennessee, had adopted the

And just a few months ago, the Supreme Court

21

of Alaska, in the National Bank of Alaska case, held

that it would be an unlawful discrimination for state

24

federal obligations while excluding income from Alaska

25

state obligations.

In a slightly different context but involving

2

the same principle this Court, in fact, in 1960 in the

3

Phillips Chemical case, invalidated a state tax imposed

on a lessee of federal lands where an equivalent tax

except state lands.

The Court said, the state and the

10

government.

It does not seem too much to require that

11

the state treat those who deal with the government as

12

well as it treats those with whom it deals itself.
This language was repeated by the Court in

3
4

invalidating a Washington state tax in the Moses Lake

5

Homes case in 1961, and certainly applies here.
As very simply put in Curtis, the state has no

provides that the states may tax national banks to the

13

that the tax burden on private lands was exactly the

was sufficient for the matter to be treated as one of

discrimination, invalidating the state tax.

And in Wilier versus Milwaukee, a case relied

18

on very heavily by the State of Tennessee in its briefs,

19

the record discloses that the tax there involved did not

20

apply solely to income derived from federal obligations,

21

but also applied to income from a variety of other

22

sources such as wages, salaries, business profits,

23

dividends from activities carried on in other states.

24

And this Court held that the tax was invalid because of

25

its discrimination in exempting income from other

As the Curtis case said, when Pennsylvania

20

exempts from taxation its own securities but taxes

21

directly or indirectly the securities of the United

22

States, the latter securities are handicapped in their

23

competition with the securities of Pennsylvania among

24

buyers in the marketplace.

As far back as H*Culloch versus Maryland and

Weston versus City of Charleston in the 1800s, this

2

Court said that it would invalidate a discriminatory tax

3

however inconsiderable the burden on the government.

4

And in both Smith versus Davis in 1944 and the New

5

Jersey Realty Title Insurance Company case in 1946, this

6

Court reiterated the principle by ruling that the

7

exemption statute is intended, and I quote, "to prevent

8

taxes which diminish in the slightest degree the market

9

value or investment attractiveness of obligations issued

by the United States.
It can hardly be said that the burden here is

12

even slight or inconsiderable, in light of the Solicitor

13

General's calculation in the Amicus brief, which the

14

Solicitor General has filed in behalf of the federal

15

government in this case, that imposition of a tax by

16

every state similar to that of the bank tax imposed by

17

Tennessee would impose an additional burden on the

18

borrowing power of the United States of over a quarter

19

of a billion dollars a year.

20

For all of these reasons, we submit that the

21

Court should reverse the Tennessee Supreme Court and

22

hold that the Tennessee bank tax violates federal law to

23

the extent that it requires that there be included in

24

the tax base obligations of the federal government and

25

its instrumentalities and all the interest thereon.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JIMMY C. CREECY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE, WILLIAM M. LEECH, JR.
MR. CREECYi

Mr. Chief Justice, and Justices,

may it please the Court:
Because of the impact of this case upon state
and local government, a motion was filed to divide the
argument in this case and it was granted.

In examining

the Tennessee bank tax statute here. Section 742 sets up
two standards.

One, the nature of the tax imposed; and

two, whether or not there is discrimination against
federal securities within the meaning of Section 742.
For the purposes of oral argument, I will address the
nature of the tax involved, and Mr. Minor Tait,
representing Shelby County in Memphis, Tennessee, will
address the discrimination issue.
Section 742 of Title 31 is a codification of
many opinions of this Court dealing with the parameters
within which a state pay tax federal securities and the
interest thereon, in accordance with the Supremacy
Clause and the Borrowing Clause of the Federal
Constitution.

As early as 1819 in the similar case of

M'Culloch v. Maryland the principle was established that

this is a franchise tax within the meaning of Section

I think the Court can quite easily rule that

of the banking privilege in the state of Tennessee.

20

And for several reasons.

Article II, Section

28 of our state constitution which was amended in 1973

22

permits our legislature to impose a tax upon banks and

23

other financial institutions in lieu of the intangible

24

personal property tax.

25

Now, the Tennessee General Assembly has done

statute; it specifically identifies the tax as an excise

any kind of a tax on the Tennessee Valley Authority?

Does the state of Tennessee levy

2

while you're interrupted.

The parties stipulated that

no tax is due if the federal obligations can't be

mean that no minimum tax would be owing, regardless of

what we held under the Tennessee tax provisions?

Now, does that stipulation

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. MINOR TAIT, JR., ESQ.

9

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES, GARNER and FOSTER

10
11

MR. TAIT;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;

12

As Mr. Creecy stated, we have more or less

3

divided our arguments, since the Court did grant us

4

permission to make divided argument.

5

going to address the question of discrimination.

6

I'm primarily

I think that this case turns on two simple

7

points.

Number one, what type of tax is involved; and

8

number two, is the tax discriminatory.

9

that no state can tax an obligation of the United States

Now, it's clear

20

unless Congress has given its permission.

2

this point is even in issue.

22

I don't think

At the time that we tried this case at the

23

trial level, Congress had given the states permission to

24

tax federal obligations in two areas.

25

12-548 which was the right to tax national banks and

Number one was

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

national banks' shares.

31-742 gave the states the

2

right to tax any obligation as long as it was a

3

non-discriminatory franchise tax.

4

Now, at the trial level we raised both 548 and

5

742, but the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled that this was

6

a 742 tax, which was a non-discriminatory franchise

7

tax.

So I only briefly addressed that in my brief.

8

Now, to be a franchise tax, as Mr. Creecy has

9

pointed out, it determines on whether or not the tax is

10

on the business of a corporation — and I think it's

11

important to realize that when you talk about

12

non-discriminatory, you've got to determine are we

13

talking about a franchise tax, are we talking about a

14

property tax, are we talking about an income tax.
Now, I submit that the appellants in their

15
16

brief have lumped together all type of taxes that this

17

court has heretofore ruled on.

18

together property taxes, they have lumped together

19

income taxes, they have lumped together franchise

20

taxes.

21

non-discriminatory franchise tax, and that's all.

22

not talking about a property tax or an income tax.

23

They have lumped

Now, what we're talking about in this case is a
We're

Now, it's been held by this Court on many

24

occasions that a state has wide discretion in enacting

25

franchise taxes.

That if a corporation comes into a

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

state and gets the privileges to operate as a

2

corporation, they must pay a tax to do that.

3

our position that a state has much wider discretion and

4

authority in the area of a franchise tax than it does in

5

the area of property taxes or income taxes.

6

And it's

Now, when we look, at whether or not this is a

7

discriminatory act -- and I'm not going to address

8

whether or not it's a franchise tax or property tax

9

because Mr. Creecy has done that.

But when we look in

10

the area of whether or not this is a discriminatory tax,

11

then we have to look to the decisions of this honorable

12

Court, and we^have to look to the intention of Congress.

13

Now, it is our position that discriminatory

14

does not mean what the appellants would have this Court

15

believe it means.

16

definition of discrimination, as I understand their

17

argument they are saying that if a state exempts

18

anything from a tax base, then they have to exempt

19

federal obligations or else it's discriminatory.

20

If you adopt the appellant's

Now, I take that to mean that if a state

21

exempted charities or hospitals or religious

22

institutions, then by the same token, they would have to

23

exempt government securities or government obligations.

25

QUESTIONS

MR. TAIT;

That was what he was arguing to the

3

Court, but it's our position that these cases do not

4

hold that; that there’s a common thread throughout the

5

holdings of this Court that when you talk about

6

discrimination in the context of a franchise tax, what

7

you’re talking about is a direct effort by the state to

8

single out the federal obligations for taxation.

9

QUESTION;

Why should intent make any

10

difference in this area?

11

legislature simply passes a tax and decides that A,

12

and C should be exempt and C, D and E should be used as

13

the base of the tax, and it turns out that they come out

14

with a product which, in effect, discriminates against

15

the federal government in Mr. Worthy’s context because

16

it taxes the revenue from federal securities but doesn’t

17

tax the revenue from state securities?

18

make any difference whether the state of Tennessee

19

intended to single out the federal government?

20

MR. TAITs

B,

Why would it

Well, the main reason, Justice

21

Rehnquist, is because that is what the decisions, in my

22

judgment, of this Court have held for over 100 years.

23

Now, that is the definition that the appellants are

24

urging on the Court; that a tax is discriminatory if the

25

taxpayer has to pay a higher tax because of the fact

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

that he owns federal obligations than if he did not own

federal obligations.

argument.

4

That's the entire thrust of their

They're saying that that's the test that you

5

look at.

That if he has to pay a higher tax because of

6

federal obligations, then that's a discriminatory tax.
QUESTION*

7

classification.

Does it explicitly exclude the income

MR. TAIT:

The bank tax simply uses taxable

18

federal income as the base for the tax.

And the bank

19

tax of Tennessee does not define or allow any

20

adjustments; it simply says you must go to the excise

21

tax of Tennessee and use that formula to determine the

22

final basis of the federal taxable income and the tax

23

base; that when you go to the excise statute of

24

Tennessee, the excise statute says you take the federal

25

base of taxable income and you make certain adjustments

2

But it's my point —

3

QUESTION:

My remark was merely directed to

4

these comments about intent.

5

but it came out with Tennessee bonds being excluded.

6

MR. TAIT;

Maybe there was no intent,

I think it’s clear from this record

7

that the Tennessee legislature itself did nothing to tax

8

federal obligations.

9

important point because throughout the cases on this

And I think that's a key and

10

subject there's a thread that says that it has to be a

11

direct intentional act to single out the federal

12

obligations for taxation.

13

QUESTION;

Mr. Tait, am I mistaken or do I

14

recall correctly that your tax law does impose a tax on

15

the income from other state bonds; not Tennessee but,

16

say. West Virginia?

17

MR. TAIT;

On the basis from federal taxable

18

income, the state act adds in the obligations from other

19

sta tes.

20
21

QUESTION;

Now, that's not in the — even

though the federal government doesn't tax those.

22

MR. TAIT;

That's correct. Your Honor.

23

QUESTION;

So what they did, in effect, is

24

they added into the federal base all state income except

25

from Tennessee bonds.

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

KB. TAITi

Except Tennessee.

And under

2

Tennessee law, Tennessee obligations are excluded.

3

Tennessee could not add in Tennessee obligations.

4

So

An interesting comment of this Court was in

5

Killer versus Nilvaukee — and this is a case, or one of

6

the cases that we're relying upon on our position that

7

it has to be more than just a discrimination or a

8

difference in the tax base.

9

tax may very well be upheld as against any casual effect

And I quote from Killer, "A

10

it may have upon the bonds of the United States when

11

passed with a different intent and not aimed at them.

12

But it becomes a more serious attack on their immunity

13

when they are its obvious aim."

14

Now, it's our position that that shows that

15

what they're talking about in the context of a franchise

16

tax — and I keep coming back to that because the

17

appellants are lumping in all type of taxes.

18

even talking about -- and Mr. Worthy mentioned — cases

19

involved doing business with the United States

20

government, and they've cited in their brief property

21

taxes and income taxes.

22

They're

But a franchise tax, based upon prior holdings

23

of this court, is a peculiar tax.

And this Court has

24

ruled time and time again that the states have a vide

25

discretion in assessing a franchise tax.

They can

for another property.

Now, this same theme —

May I ask this question?

Supposing

it were not a franchise tax, for a moment, but were an

I don’t think that it’s what they

upon the appellants to prove that, if that is their

8

position.

9

joy in citing the amicus brief of the Attorney General

Now, if they cite out — and they take great

10

that some $250 million in obligations are involved.

11

That’s assuming that all of these banks would abandon

12

U.S. obligations and buy Tennessee obligations, of which

13

there’s no proof at all in this record.

14

QUESTION*

Can I ask you one question before

15

you sit down.

Am I correct in assuming there really is

16

no difference in the legal position of your client and

17

of the state’s position?

18

NS. TAIT*

The positions are identical.

19

QUESTION;

I wonder why you filed separate

20

21

briefs and had separate arguments?
MR. TAIT;

Well, the money goes to the county

22

and city; it does not go to the state — the state has

23

an interest in the constitutionality of the statute in

24

question, and I might point out that this is of utmost

25

concern to the state of Tennessee because the formula

that we use in the bank tax is the same formula that we

2

use in our excise tax.

3

QUESTION*

I'm not questioning your right,

4

either of you.

5

because it's sometimes a less effective method of

6

presentation to divide arguments.

I'm just curious to know as a matter --

MR. TAITs

7

Well, I was going to argue and the

8

state wanted to be heard because of the

9

constitutionality, and that's basically what happened.

10

I felt like that we should split it because there's more

11

involved than just the interest of Memphis and Shelby

12

County, Tennessee in this lawsuit* it has statewide

13

application, and I just felt like it should be split and

14

agreed to.

I thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF K. MARTIN WORTHY, ESQ.

17

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT — REBUTTAL

18

MR. WORTHY*

19

20

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Courts
Mr. Creacy cited a number of cases in which

21

this Court has held that a franchise tax may properly be

22

imposed on the interest on federal obligations or on

23

federal obligations themselves.

24

however, that several of those cases, the Educational

25

Foundation case, the Werner Machine case, the

He failed to note,

36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
*40 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Tradesman's Bank case and many others, all note that the

2

states can impose such a tax, provided it is not

3

discriminatory.

4

For example, in the Werner Machine Company

5

case, it validated the tax, held it was lawful, since

6

the tax measures -- since the tax is the same whatever

7

the character of the assets may be.

8
9

Now, interestingly enough, when Mr. Tait talks
about discrimination, he hasn’t really told us what

10

discrimination is except to say that all of the theories

11

of discrimination which this Court has announced in

12

numerous cases, are inapplicable.

13

there is no discrimination if federal obligations are

14

not singled out.

15

All he says is that

As I pointed out in my original argument, in

16

both the Phillips Chemical case and the Miller versus

17

Milwaukee case, there was no singling out of federal

18

obligations, yet the tax was found to be invalid.

19

And insofar as the intent of the legislature

20

in imposing the tax is concerned, I do call to your

21

attention that the Tennessee legislature was

22

specifically aware, when it adopted the formula for the

23

measurement of income, as shown by the report of the

24

legislative committee which is referred to on page 10 of

25

our Reply Brief, that it knew that it was taxing

1

interest on federal obligations, knew that it was not

2

taxing interest on obligations of the state of

3

Tennessee, knew that it was taxing interest on

4

obligations of other states.
So it deliberately chose the course which it

5
6

followed.

7

Thank you.
