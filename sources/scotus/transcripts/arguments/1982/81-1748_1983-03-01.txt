ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This case is here for a second time on writ of
certiorari to review a decision of the former United

10

States Court of Claim holding that the United States is

11

answerable in money damages for alleged statutory

12

violations pertaining to management by the Secretary of

13

the Interior of timber on allotted lands of the Quinault

14

Indian Reservation in the State of Washington.

15

Throughout this litigation several categories

16

of damages have been sought by the respondents against

17

the United States.

18

in revenues earned on the account of the respondents

19

owing to the Secretary's failure to obtain maximum

20

market value from purchasers of the Indian timber for

21

timber sold; the Secretary's alleged failure to manage

22

the timber on a sustained yield basis; and the

23

Secretary's alleged failure to sell some of the

24

merchantable timber located on the Indian allotments.

25

These include an alleged shortfall

In addition, damages are sought for the

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Secretary's failure to develop an optimum system of

2

roads in the logged areas and for roadbuilding charges

3

deducted from the revenues earned on timber sales.

4

finally, respondents complain that insufficient interest

5

was paid or in some cases that no interest was paid on

6

funds held by the Secretary on the account of the Indian

7

respondents.

8

9

And

When this case first came before the Court of
Claims, that court held that Section 5 of the General

10

Allotment Act, pursuant to which the forested lands of

11

the Quinault Indian Reservation had been allotted,

12

established a general trust which included management

13

duties, and that by necessary implication the remedy of

14

damages was available to the respondents to redress any

15

mismanagement of the timber resources.

16

This Court in the case that we call Mitchell 1

17

reversed that decision of the Court of Claims.

18

Court did not reach the question whether the creation of

19

an express trust by statute would itself ground an

20

action for damages against the United States, because

21

the Court concluded that the trust that had in fact been

22

created by the General Allotment Act was not a general

23

trust and did not encompass duties of management.

24
25

The

This Court remanded the case .to the Court of
Claims to provide that court with an opportunity to

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

reach other theories of recovery advanced by the

2

respondents.

3

In Hitchell 2, the en banc Court of Claims,

4

with Judge Nichols dissenting this time, again held that

5

the United States was answerable in damages in respect

6

of each of the respondents' major claims of injury.

7

threshold, the court refused to confine the implication

8

of a damage remedy against the United States to statutes

9

which provide for the payment of money or which

10

The

expressly provide for a damage remedy.

11

The court then turned to the particular

12

statutes which are involved here.

13

406, 407 and 466, which pertain to the sale of timber on

14

Indian lands; another group of statutes in 25 U.S.C.

15

318(a) and 323 through 325, which govern roadbuilding on

16

Indian reservations and the granting of rights-of-way

17

over Indian lands.

These ares

25 U.S.C.

18

Although the court recognized that none of

19

these statutes expressly created a trust duty of any

20

kind, the court held that "A long continuing doctrine of

21

governmental fiduciary obligation in the management of

22

Indian property was,” quote, "infused into these

23

statutes."

24

purpose of the statutes generally from -the point of view

25

of the Indians was to generate revenue, it was necessary

And the court thought that because the

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2346

1

that the court imply a damages remedy to enforce the

2

statutory requirements.

3

Accordingly, the court held that recovery in

4

damages of amounts that should have been earned but were

5

not earned on the account of the Indian beneficiaries

6

could be recovered against the United States, and that

7

similar damages could be recovered under the

8

roadbuilding statutes.

9

damages could be recovered against the United States for

Finally, the court held that

10

failure to pay interest on respondents' funds held by

11

the United States at a rate reflecting reasonable

12

management zeal to get the best interest rate for

13

respondents.

14

Because of the substantial importance of the

15

-- of the doctrinal holding of the Court of Claims and

16

because of the substantial amount of money which is at

17

stake in this case, we have again sought this Court's

18

review.

19

It is our central submission that the Court of

20

Claims* analysis is inconsistent with the teaching of

21

this Court respecting recovery of damages against the

22

United States in that the decision below effectively

23

dispenses with the requirement that Congress authorized

24

the recovery of damages.

25

The parties appear to be in agreement on one

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

fundamental point, and that is the standard for

2

determining whether a statute provides for the recovery

3

of damages against the United States is that supplied by

4

this Court's decision in United States v. Testan; that

5

is,

6

itself can fairly be interpreted as mandating

7

compensation for the damage sustained."

whether the statute — and I'd like to quote — "in

8

At that point agreement ends in this case, and

9

the question is what it means to fairly — for a statute

10

to be fairly interpretable as mandating compensation.
In our own analysis we start with the language

11
12

of the pertinent statutes.

13

in this case makes any mention of maintenance of

14

litigation or recovery of damages against the United

15

States.

16

Hone of the statues involved

Furthermore, although the statutes do in some

17

instances refer to the payment of money, the Court of

18

Claims did not suggest, nor does respondent now suggest,

19

that their claims arise under that statutory language.

20

QUESTIONS

I guess you would concede, wouldn't

21

you, though, that, for instance, the timber statutes

22

would mandate that the Government pay the allottees the

23

money to the extent that it's earned on the timber?

24
25

MR. SCHWARTZ*

Yes, Justice CL'Connor.

And, in

fact, we make the further point that because the statute

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

makes that clear, it is to be assumed that Congress did

2

not intend to sanction the recovery of some other

3

amounts of money against the United States.
I would add one point of qualification.

4

The

5

statute in fact prescribes that the money be paid to the

6

Indians or used for their benefit, so that if the

7

Secretary — the Secretary has the authority to do other

8

things with the money.

9

would not -- the Indians would be able to maintain suit,

But were he not to do that, he

10

we suppose, to compel the funds that are in hand to be

11

disgorged.

12

It's our view that the statutory language here

13

might be profitably compared with statutes which have

14

been regarded as authorizing the recovery of damages

15

against the United States.

16

to mind is the Federal Tort Claims Act which specifies

17

that the United States shall be liable respecting

18

provisions of this title relating to tort claims in the

19

same manner and to the same extent as a private

20

individual under like circumstances.

A common example that comes

21

Another comparison might be drawn to the

22

language of the Indian Claims Commission Act which

23

provides that the Claims Commission shall herein

24

determine all claims in law and equity .with respect to

25

which the claimant would have been entitled to sue in a

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

court of the United States if the United States were

2

sueable; and moreover, all claims based on fair and

3

honorable dealings that are not recognized by an

4

existing rule of law or equity.

5

QUESTION;

Mr. Schwartz, can I interrupt a

6

second, because Justice O'Connor's question troubles me

7

also.

8

9
10

There's no such language in the statute that
says when you sell the timber and collect some money,
you pay it over to the Indians, is there?

11

MR. SCHWARTZ;

Oh, no, there is such language,

12

and I gathered that was the basis of Justice O'Connor's

13

question, with the one qualification that I've given.

14

The statute, if I may direction your attention to page

15

1A of the Appendix.

16

QUESTION;

17

MR. SCHWARTZ;

I don't seem to have it.
If I may read;

Go ahead.

"The timber on

18

any Indian land held on a trust — held under a trust or

19

other patent containing restrictions on alienations may

20

be sold by the owner with the consent of the Secretary"

21

-- I'll skip over a few words, if I may — "and the

22

proceeds from such sales, after deductions for

23

administrative expenses, shall be paid to the owner or

24

owners."

25

It is that kind of provision which we have in

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

mind as likely grounding an action to recover monies

2

against the United States.

3

language, we submit, suggests that some other larger

4

group of monies that are not in hand and are not

5

proceeds cannot be recovered against the United States.

6

QUESTION:

And the existence of that

But the language of "shall be paid

7

to the owner" is sufficient in your view to constitute a

8

waiver of sovereign immunity under Testan, is that right?

9

MR. SCHWARTZj

Justice O'Connor, we think it

10

probably would be held to be.

11

inevitable grayness and fuzziness as to what is a

12

mandate for compensation.

13

that unequivocally direct payment of money generally,

14

presumptively or ordinarily would be understood as

15

sufficiently clear.

16

not invariably ground compensation.

17

Testan, there is some

It is our view that statutes

On the other hand, such statutes do

This Court's decision last term in United

18

States v. Erica comes to mind.

Although the Court there

19

didn't reach a sovereign immunity issue and specified

20

that, because it found an express bar to recovery of

21

damages, we would suppose that the Court could have

22

couched its holding in terms that the Government did not

23

consent the recovery of damages.

24

statute provides for payment of money wathout any

25

qualification, then the presumption may go one way.

Where — where a

10

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

When there is no such provision, for reasons I'd like to

2

turn to, we think the presumption should be very

3

strongly the other way.
There's a fundamental difference that we

4
5

believe should not escape notice between statutes that

6

direct payment of money and statutes that impose

7

nonmonetary duties upon officers of the United States.
QUESTION;

8

9

again?

Can I go back to the timber statute

I do have it in front of me now.

It does have

10

the mandatory language that you called our attention to,

11

the proceeds shall be paid over.

12

paragraph there is this mandatory language about what

13

the Secretary shall do with regard to administrative

14

expenses and how he should sell it.

Then later in the same

You're saying that the second half of it

15
16

doesn't contemplate any — any payment if he breaches

17

those duties, is that it?

18

MR. SCHWARTZ;

19

reference is to in the second -QUESTION;

20

I'm not sure what — what your

Well, sales of timber under this

21

subsection shall be based upon a consideration of the

22

needs and best interests of the owner, Indian owners and

23

his heirs.

24

ignore that and sell it for half of wha_t I think I could

25

get for it.

And say the Secretary says well, I'll just

1

MR, SCHWARTZ:

In that event it is our

2

submission — I’d like to turn to the difference between

3

that kind of statutory provision and the one that goes

4

before.
The short answer is that we believe that the

5
6

second kind of duties are nonmonetary duties and that

7

Congress should be understood to have intended a

8

nonmonetary specific injunctive or declaratory remedy.
QUESTION:

9

Even though they come in a

10

statutory provision that you acknowledge is — does —

11

can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation.

12

MR. SCHWARTZ:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. SCHWARTZ:

For certain items.

I see.
We think that it is in the

15

nature of the sovereign immunity analysis that very

16

particular attention should be paid to what items

17

Congress contemplated to be paid without further

18

authority and what items not.

19

QUESTION:

I understood your brief to take the

20

position you really weren’t arguing sovereign immunity.

21

You’re basically arguing implied cause of action theory.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

22

Perhaps I should spend a minute

23

on that.

I think this is a bit of semantic confusion.

24

I don’t really want to take much time unless it concerns

25

the Court.

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

It is our understanding that the Court has

2

used somewhat inconsistent language from time to time in

3

describing the Tucker Act.

4

such as United States v. Sherwood and last term's

5

decision in Army and Air Force Exchange v. Sheehan refer

6

to the Tucker Act as a waiver of sovereign immunity, and

7

cases such as Mitchell 1 and Testan say that it is not,

8

that it is merely jurisdictional; that some other

9

statute must provide the waiver.

10
11

We believe that the cases

It seems to us that it doesn't matter how you
put the point.

Clearly, the Tucker Act is sufficient

2

unto itself as a basis for recovering damages on a

3

contract claim.

4

that.

5

That's — the Tucker Act didn't do

The Tucker Act didn't do anything at all.
On the other hand, we suppose — the Congress

6

and the legislative history is consistent -- that

7

Congress did not consent to recovery of damages on any

8

claim that might be tied to some statute which imposes a

9

nonmonetary duty.

And the way that has been

20

rationalized and expressed by the Court in Testan and

2

Mitchell is that what — Congress provided jurisdiction

22

to entertain claims where the act of Congress was of a

23

particular character.

24
25

Now, one can say that as to the statutory
claims, the Tucker Act is a waiver of sovereign immunity

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and that the other statute must provide the right of

2

action, or one can say that the Tucker Act is merely a

3

conditional waiver as to the statutory claims, or one

4

can say, as Testan appears to have literally said, that

5

it's not a waiver at all.
But the point to us seems to be exactly the

6

7

same any way you read its

either the rule is that a

8

waiver -- waivers of sovereign immunity are to be

9

strictly construed according to their terms, or else the

10

rule is that an unequivocal sovereign immunity is

11

required.

12

In either event, the other statute in addition

13

to the Tucker Act must make clear that Congress

14

contemplated the award of damages.

15

a semantic embroglio we may have created by ourselves.

16

But we don't think the legal result —

17

QUESTIONS

18

MR. SCHWARTZ*

19
20

And this is sort of

You didn't create it.

We did.

Gracious of you to say so,

Justice Rehnquist.
We do think — I'd like to explain why the

21

provisions of statutes such as Section 406 that create

22

nonmonetary obligations for federal officers have a

23

different standing in the sovereign immunity analysis,

24

if I may use that shorthand, than statutes that

25

contemplate the payment of money.

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Statutes that prescribe the payment of money

2

create an obligation for the United States.

3

that direct federal officers to take certain action

4

prescribe duties for officers.

5

statutes, absent some comment by Congress, some

6

indication that Congress appreciated that federal

7

officers might not perform their duties, and that the

8

United States Treasury might thereby be impacted for —

9

by an action for damages, we think the contrary

Statues

And as to those

10

presumption is the correct one, that Congress expected

11

that federal officers would do what they were told, and

12

that if thay did not, the remedy available was an action

13

to compel the performance of those statutory duties.

14

QUESTIONx

Against them.

15

HR. SCHWARTZ;

Against — in their official

16

capacity, though, not an act — we're not talking

17

Gibbons action here.
QUESTION;

18

What we have in mind is -Oh, no.

Against them, though, in

19

-- you wouldn't say it was a suit against the United

20

States.

21

MR. SCHWARTZ &

I — I — technically I think

22

not, Justice White, although since the 1976, I think,

23

amendment of the Administrative Procedure Act it doesn’t

24

matter whether you name the defendant tjie United States

25

or you name the defendant the Secretary of the Interior.

1

2

QUESTION!

But, in any event, you could get

only prospective recovery.

3

ME. SCHWAETZ:

That's right.

And it is our

4

submission that the remedy that was available to enforce

5

these nonmonetary duties was that kind of remedy.

6

there are a number of reasons why we believe that is the

7

appropriate kind of remedy.
Congress, in prescribing nonmonetary duties,

8
9

And

has never shown that it appreciated that the Treasury

10

would be held accountable for the — for the misfeasance

11

of federal officers.

12

case I use those terms because that is what is alleged,

13

and it's never been determined whether there has in fact

14

been any statutory violation.

15

Of course, in the context of this

The — there is another critical point here.

16

The respondents argue that the value to them of

17

performance of these duties which we call nonmonetary

18

was financial; and I assume that that is perfectly

19

accurate.

20

indicate that Congress contemplated the payment of money

21

from the United States Treasury or sanctioned that

22

recovery as is required unless there is evidence that

23

Congress contemplated what would happen if the federal

24

officers did not perform their statutory duties and were

25

allowed to go uncorrected in that course.

But that in itself is not sufficient to

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

In this case — I would also add that this

2

Court's decision in United States v. Testan cannot be

3

distinguished in the manner which is implicitly

4

suggested by this line of argument, because the same

5

argument could have been made in Testan, and if I read

6

the Court's opinion correctly, essentially the same

7

argument was made in Testan.

8
9

The statute there involved was the
Classification Act which established criteria for the

10

grading of federal employees.

11

federal employee such as the respondent, Herman Testan,

12

of such a statute was monetary.

13

provision of yet another statute which said that if

14

you're rated at GS-12 as a Government attorney, your

15

salary is thus and so.

16

therefore, of compliance with the Classification Act in

17

his case was monetary as well.

18

The value to a particular

It came through the

The value to Herman Testan,

But the Court refused to telescope the

19

nonmonetary predicate duty into the monetary duty which

20

lay behind it.

21

action for injunctive relief, and if you were

22

reclassified as a GS-14 attorney, then you may recovery

23

the salary to which you would be entitled; but Congress

24

has not authorized the recovery of damages for* your

25

misclassification.

The Court instead said you may have an

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 5S4-2345

1

The same analysis applies here.

An injunctive

2

action may be available to compel the Secretary to alter

3

his practices, if in fact they're improper, in the

4

oversight of sales of Indian timber.

5

done, the provision which Justice O'Connor pointed out

6

requiring the payment of proceeds will then round an

7

action to make sure that those proceeds are paid.

8

two steps cannot be divided, and that we take to be the

9

teaching of Testan.

10

And if that is

The

In a sense this case stands on a — this case

11

is an easier case, we would submit, for the Government

12

than Testan, because in Testan if the nonmonetary duty

13

of proper classification were properly performed, the

14

higher salary that would be owing to the Respondent

15

would come from the Treasury.

16

In this case had the Government performed the

17

nonmonetary duties that it is alleged to have improperly

18

performed in a more suitable manner, the extra sums

19

earned would have come from those who would have paid

20

for the timber.

21

expect that Congress contemplated the Onited States

22

It is important to know, however, that there
are a number of separate statutes involved here for

different kinds of claims, that they can't be grouped

argument respecting some of the statutory claims.

don't find any arguments made in defense of the Court of

Claims' holding that Section 318(a), which authorizes

the appropriation of funds for building of roads on

recovery of damages.

25

recovery of damages.

The main statute at issue here, however, is 25

U.S.C. 406(a)# which governs the sale of timber on

Indian allotments.

course, is that there is no mention of damages in the

And I would also point out that under the

2

statute prior to 1964, as today, the power to sell

3

timber actually was given to the individual and not to

4

the Secretary.

Secretary was to act as a constraining influence.

It was the Secretary's consent.

The

Sow, the Government does not deny, as this

7

Court's opinion in White Mountain Apache v. Bracker

8

makes clear, that it -- the Secretary actually

undertakes a rather comprehensive role.

But that role

10

in this case, as respondent has made quite clear, was

11

made possible not by the statute alone, but by the

12

powers of attorney which were signed here which granted

13

the allottee's authority to sell timber to the

14

Secretary.

15

powers of attorney don't themselves ground an action for

16

damages.

17

talked in terms of the allottee selling timber, could

18

scarcely have contemplated that the Government would be

19

liable for the Secretary's mismanagement.

And as we've argued in the briefs, those

What is relevant is that Congress, which

The — I think I'd prefer to leave the balance

21

of the detailed statutory argument for the briefs.

The

22

key point is that rather than engage in anything like

23

the kind of analysis that we've laid out, which we

24

submit is the reanalysis required by th_e decision in

25

Testan, the Court of Claims proceeded by an entirely

21

1

different route

2

It built on — it proceeded by three

3

extrapolations of the existing law, each of which we

4

submit to be erroneous.

5

statute need not prescribe either the recoverability of

6

damages or require the payment of money to ground an

7

action for compensation.

8
9

The first was the idea that a

The second is that even though the statues
involved here do not in term speak of trust duties, that

10

Indian — statutes governing the management of Indian

11

property generally should be understood to have a trust

12

character.

13

And third is it is necessary that -- that

14

given the existence of a trust duty that damages be

15

recoverable.

16

It may well be, and the decisions of this

17

Court suggest, that statutes governing the

18

responsibilities of the Government pertaining to Indian

19

property are to be read with a fiduciary clause, but

20

none of those decisions suggest that that is in itself a

21

sufficient basis for recovery of damages.

22

And it is a very serious matter, we submit,

23

when the Court of Claims suggest that even though

24

Congress did not address itself to a trust character of

25

the duty that that trust character of the duty is

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

somehow sufficient to ground an action for damages.

2

Congress had said the Secretary shall hold these lands

3

in trust and pursuant to that trust manage these lands

4

and assure that the highest return is earned for the

5

allottees pursuant to prudent and professional forestry

6

management practices, that might be a different matter.

7

But Congress has not created such a trust, and even if

8

it had, the question would still remain did Congress

9

foresee the recoverability of damages.

10

If

The effect of the Court of Claims reasoning

11

interpolating trust duties, and further, interpolating a

12

damages remedy into a silent statute and legislative

13

record is to engage in that kind of judicial legislation

14

that was condemned by this Court’s decision in Testan,

15

as well as the private right of action cases that we’ve

16

referred to which we think provide a cognate line of

17

authority.

18

The Court in Testan said that it should not

19

tamper with established principles because it was

20

thought that they should be made responsive to a

21

particular conception of enlightened Government policy.

22

And that, we submit, is exactly what the Court of Claims

23

has done here.

24

alone to prescribe the availability of .damages against

25

the United States.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9

The opinion you're going to write in this case

10

will be the seventh reported opinion in the history of

11

this long case.

12

the United States takes control and custody of Indian

13

property, in this case timber, and sells it for less

14

than its market value, must the Government make good

15

that loss, or is the Indian without remedy for that

loss?

is no remedy in damages, then there is no remedy at all.

18

The question now is simply this*

When

If you rule, as the Government urges, that there

Before turning to the Government's points,

I'd

19

like to state the background of this case in our terms.

20

These Indians aboriginally used and occupied the Olympic

21

Peninsula of Washington and the area south of that which

22

is an area covered by dense forest.

23

Government made a treaty with some of these Indians, and

24

as to the rest of the Indians who refusjed to sell their

25

land, who refused to sign that treaty, the Government

In the 1850s the

1

simply took over the land and thereafter treated it as

2

if they had signed the treaty.

3

A reservation was established in the middle of

4

this aboriginal territory for all of these Indians,

5

those who signed the treaty and those who did not, and

6

in time that reservation was divided pursuant to the

7

General Allotment Act of 1887 into small 80-acre

8

allotments.

9

is well covered, and it's got a map showing aboriainal

Each Indian got one allotment.

All of this

10

territory in the brief we filed three years ago when

11

this case and this question were first before you.
Now, each trust allotment was a formal

12
13

statutory express trust under the General Allotment Act

14

of 1887.

15

that nothing in the General Allotment Act said anything

16

about timber management duties.

17

Allotment Act was not for the purpose of giving

18

timberland to Indians; they couldn’t work that.

19

purpose of the act was to give them farmland or grazing

20

land.

21

Now, it's true, as you said three years ago,

That's because the

The

And in this case that was not possible, so

22

what the Indians got was property that there was no way

23

that they personally could work the land.

24

happenstance that they came from a part- of the country

25

where there was not enough farmland to go around.

It was just a

1

Now, since this was trust land, the Indians

2

couldn't sell their timber, even if they were

3

knowledgeable about it and even if they wanted to sell

4

it.

5

incidentally, Indians who own trust allotments are in a

6

small minority nationwide.

7

have trust allotments that are farmland or grazing

8

land .

9

Congress was aware of this, and in 1910 —

Nationwide, most Indians

In 1910 Congress had heard that the Indians

10

weren't getting any revenue out of their timber, and

11

that was an unfortunate thing, and Congress ought to do

12

something about it.

13

which is the principal act upon which we rely.

14

says that the timber on these trust allotments can be

15

sold by the Indian with the consent of the Secretary.

16

So Congress passed the Act of 1910,
That act

Now, merely consenting to the sale of the

17

timber doesn’t on its face sound like the Secretary is

18

being given much authority to manage and sell this

19

timber; but it really does mean that in practice.

20

you look at what's involved in selling timber, which is

21

you require a high degree of know-how and you require

22

resources to get the timber out of there.

23

logging timber is a sophisticated process, and it can't

24

be handled by an untrained person.

25

When

Selling and

To his credit, the Secretary realized this,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

and right from the beginning he interpreted the 1910 Act

2

as giving him the authority to manage these timber

sales, and that's what he did.

4

regulations beginning in 1911, the year after the act,

5

and he employed a large staff to manage these sales.

6

You referred to this same comprehensive management

7

system in White Mountain Apache v. Bracker which you

8

decided three years ago.

9

He wrote very extensive

I might add that starting in 1920, Congress

10

authorized the Secretary to begin charging a fee for his

11

services, and the Secretary did so.

12

regulations that permit fees up to 10 percent.

He enacted

In 1941 some of the Indians objected to this

13
14

comprehensive control that the Secretary was exercising

15

over their land, and they went to court.

16

an injunction to make the Secretary stop exercising all

17

this control over their land which they felt was not

good management.

19

Secretary's interpretation of the act was correct.

1964 — Congress amended the 1910 Act, and

22

they made explicit at that time some of the factors that

the Secretary had already read into the 1910 Act, such

24

as the need to maintain the productive .capacity of the

25

land and the best interests of the Indian allottee.

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

There are other relevant statutes such as

2

those requiring the Secretary to manage the timber on a

3

sustained yield basis.

4

in the 1910 Act, but it wasn't made an express statutory

5

command until 1934.

That was contemplated actually

Another one is the suite of statutes

6

7

authorizing the Secretary to grant rights-of-way to

8

outsiders across Indian land upon payment of

9

compensation.

Still another is authorizing him to

10

invest timber proceeds and other money for the benefit

11

of the Indians.
Incidentally, that's not a statute calling for

12
13

interest.

It's a statute calling for investment, and

14

the investments are limited to federal securities.
These statutes are all part of one statutory

15
16

program.

The basic act is the General Allotment Act

17

which established the trust, which admittedly with

18

respect to timber was a bare trust.
The statutes supplementing the General

19
20

Allotment Act are, as I've said, the 1910 Act, the 1964

21

Act amending it, the 1934 sustained yield act, the

22

right-of-way acts, and the interest acts -- excuse me,

23

the investment acts.
Now, so far I've been talking^about individual

24
25

Indians.

The tribe owns timber also, and they are a

28

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

2

treated their timber essentially the same as he did the

3

tribal timber under another section of the 1910 Act.

4

As to them, the Secretary

The tribal timber was not held in trust under

5

the General Allotment Act, but it was held in trust

6

under other acts.

7

Act of 1934, and there were several other special acts

8

whereby Congress made direct grants of land to the tribe

9

in trust for the tribe.

One act was the Indian Reorganization

These are cited in our brief.

Now, none of the tribal trusts spelled out any

10
11

particular duties either any more than the General

12

Allotment Act did.

13

present were infused into these trusts by the

14

supplementary, same supplementary acts that I've just

15

mentioned.

So the duties that we argue are

The first time we were here three years ago we

16
17

argued that the fact that the United States held the

18

land in trust for the Indians was enough just by itself

19

to ground them, to ground their right for damages for

20

trust mismanagement.
You said no, the trusts taken by themselves

21

22

don't spell out any duty to manage timber, so first we

23

have to find some statutory basis for a duty to manage

24

timber.

25

also have to show that the — the other statute that

And then you said assuming we .can do that, we

1

we're relying on that bring out these duties must be

2

fairly interpreted as mandating compensation for the

3

damage sustained under the Testan rule.

4

We went back to the Court of Claims, and the

5

Court of Claims agreed after argument and re-argument,

6

both times en banc, they finally agreed 6 to 1 that the

7

statutes I mentioned supplementing the General Allotment

8

Act did impose duties to manage timber and could fairly

9

be interpreted as mandating compensation for the damage

10

sustained.
Now, here's the difference between the

11
12

majority of the Court of Claims and the dissenting

13

judge.

14

statutes that I mentioned, the 1910 Act and so forth

15

that supplement the General Allotment Act, could not be

16

fairly interpreted as requiring compensation except to

17

the extent that — and I think this is a fair

18

characterization of what he said -- except to the extent

19

that they would support an action for liquidated

20

damages.

21

that's what he meant.

22

amount of damages without much difficulty.

23

The dissenting judge felt with the supplementary

He didn't use the term "liquidated," but
He meant where you can tell the

The majority, on the other hand, was unwilling

24

to be that narrow.

They felt if the tojtal trust program

25

showed a presently existing legal right to revenue, as

1

they did, at least in the case of those allotments that

2

had been logged, that would be enough to permit a suit

3

for damages to cover the revenues properly — improperly

MR. H0BBS«

To me what you've said is the

waiver of sovereign immunity, but you need further

waiver of sovereign immunity when you're dealing with a

damage claim.

6

under which you claim contemplates, impliedly or

7

expressly, a remedy of damages.

8

that’s our problem, is trying to show that our statutes

do contemplate a remedy in damage.

10

And you have to show that the statute

That's our case, and

They don't expressly, obviously.

I'm going

to give you a number of factors that I think make this

case sui generis from those dealing with public rights

QUESTION*

Yes.

21

MR. HOBBS*

And I'm going to give you the

22

reasons why we think that it all adds up to where

23

there's a compelling inference that Congress must have

24

intended that these Indians have damagejs.

25

We think the correct statement of the law

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

consistent with what you said in Testan is this*

2

if the Court finds that Congress authorized the

3

Government to take the Indian property in trust, which

4

it did here, and operate the trust so as to generate

5

income, which it did here, or protect the value of the

6

property, which is also true here, then that alone

7

creates the cause of action for damages, which can be

8

adjudicated under the Tucker Act.

9

Well,

For jurisdictional purposes the trust fills

10

the same purpose as the contract does in the typical

11

contract case.

12

a cause of action under a contract.

13

where you find that cause of action.

that that’s not where it exists.

course of operating that trust or contract we would have

21

thought, our preference would have been to have that

22

litigated after the case begins, because so often these

23

duties are closely interwoven with the facts; and it is

24

a problem of judicial administration to. try to pull that

25

problem out and deal with it first, and then if you win

The question of what duties were breached in the

1

that, go on to your merits.

2

To us, the proper law should be that if you

3

prove the existence of the trust and that it has some

4

duties, then you're past the jurisdictional hurdle; then

5

you must show that those duties required action that the

6

Government didn't take or prohibited action that the

7

Government did take, and if so, how much the loss of

8

value was.

9

Now, the Court of Claims held that that was

10

the correct law, starting with the Klamath case in

11

1966.

12

the law expressly for five years, and the Court of

13

Claims after that Klamath case in 1966, a dozen cases

14

had ruled to that effect up until your Testan case when

15

the question arose that we're now discussing.

So when we filed our. case in 1971, that had been

That's also true in a number of other federal

16
17

courts.

18

decided by the Ninth Circuit, both the majority and the

19

dissenter thought that the existence of the trust was

20

all you needed to get through the Tucker Act.

21

was decided after Testan and Mitchell, and therefore

22

considered itself in harmony with both of your opinions.

23

The Moose case, which we've cited in our brief,

That case

The Whiskers case in the Tenth Circuit, also

24

cited in our brief, that was decided af.ter Testan but

25

before Mitchell.

They said that if you prove the trust,

1

you have proved all you need to to get into court.

2

there are two additional district courts, different

3

district courts, different judges, in California who

4

have also ruled to the same effect.

And

5

And that was the view of the three dissenting

6

Justices, I believe, as I read them, when this case was

7

here before.

8

that the question of what duties the trust imposed was

9

part of the Testan analysis and therefore a threshold

But the majority of you seemed to feel

10

issue that had to be adjudicated before the merits were

11

reached to see if they mandated compensation.

12

I have to express the hope that once the law

13

is sorted out, if it is sorted out in our favor, that it

14

would be possible to handle that question during the

15

trial of the merits rather than as a preliminary

16

question.

17

Now, I come now to the part of my argument.

18

The Government says the ultimate question here is one of

19

congressional intent.

20

what it wanted, we wouldn’t be here; so we have to look

21

to secondary sources to see what Congress intended, and

22

the intent we’re looking for is an intent that these

23

plaintiffs have money damages for the vindication of

24

their right, which everyone concedes that they have.

25

They have the right but -- they have the right, but the

We agree.

If Congress had said

4

MR. HOBBS;

And, of course, underlying

every point I make is well, how is our case different

from Testan.

eight points.
The first point is that there is the trust

10

case.

11

infused additional duties into that trust in 1910 and

12

after.

13

purpose of that trust, or at least the management of the

14

timber in trust, was to generate for the Indians

15

whatever profit the forest was capable of yielding.

16

That's a quotation from your White Mountain Apache, 448

17

U.S. 149.

18

Congress created a trust in 1877.

Then it

As this Court held in the Bracker case, the

20

case in 1941.

21

that Congress intends whatever remedy is necessary to

22

carry out that trust, if the trust is breached.

23

the purpose of this trust was to generate money, it

24

follows that Congress' intent following.. the purpose of

25

the trust was to make up for that money if the

1

Government by improper action caused a loss of that

2

money.

3

In Testan you didn't have a trust.

4

you didn’t even have a contracted employment.

5

The second point is this;

In fact,

If you feel that

6

more than the bare trust is required, well, it so

7

happens that we have an actual glimpse of the intent of

8

Congress, the actual intent of Congress here.

9

In 1946 Congress passed the Indian Claims

10

Commission Act, and part of that was what we call the

11

Indian Tucker Act.

12

a repetition of the Tucker Act and made applicable to

13

Indians.

14

they expected Indian breach of trust suits to be brought

15

under that act for damages.

The Indian Tucker Act was in effect

And the legislative history clearly shows that

I'd like to read you a couple of quotes in our

16

brief.

18

19

If you want to follow them with me, it's on page
I think the language is so strong

The sponsor of this act and the provision

21

we’re talking about was Henry Jackson of Washington, now

22

Senator Jackson.

23

that, "The Interior Department itself suggested that it

24

ought not be in a position where its employees can

25

mishandle funds and lands of a national trusteeship

He said in the course of the debate

1

2

Indians have their fair day in court so that they can

3

call the various government agencies to account on the

4

obligations that the federal government assumed."

5

Let us see that the

And the House report/ following the same

6

trend/ said, "If we fail to meet these obligations by

7

denying access to the courts when trust funds have been

8

improperly dissipated or other fiduciary duties have

9

been violated, we compromise the national honor of the

10

United States."

11

I don’t see how you can read that language and

12

conclude that Congress didn’t intend for breach of trust

13

actions involving damages to be brought under the Indian

14

Tucker Act.

15

QUESTION*.

Well, but that would all be -- if

16

you read the Indian Tucker Act that way, then Mitchell

17

was wrongly decided, wasn't it?

18

MR. HOBBSs

I can’t speak to that.

That's a

19

complex question.

20

Tucker Act has a legislative history showing that it was

21

intended that suits brought under it for breach of trust

22

could — could be brought.

23

But it is a fact that the Indian

My third point is the negative inference.

In

24

the Testan case the claimant was seeking back pay.

Now,

25

Congress had carefully spelled out what remedy you get

40

1

when you're misclassified, and one of the remedies it

2

did not mention was back pay.

3

possible act, the Back Pay Act, but that clearly did not

4

apply because it only applied to people who were removed

5

from a position they held.

6

like Testan who didn't hold the position.

There was another

It did not apply to people

Well, if Congress says if the Government

7

8

breaches its duty you get to do A, that's an implication

9

that they thought about and didn't intend for you to get

10

B.

So there's a negative inference present in Testan

11

that's not present here.

12

I think that the next point, my point number

13

four, supports that, buttresses it.

Testan was claiming

14

a right not known in common law.

15

right created by Congress, which was the right to equal

16

pay for equal work.

He was claiming a

How, it's reasonable to say for a right that

17
18

was created in the beginning by Congress with no

19

comparable rights in common law, it's reasonable to say

20

what remedy did Congress want when it created this new

21

right.

22

case that if Congress is going to create a right, it'd

23

better then spell out what remedy it wants to go with

24

this new right; otherwise, we're at sea..

25

what kind of remedy Congress wanted.

And I think it was fair to ask in the Testan

We don't know

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

But what about our case?

Our case involves a

2

trust relationship, which is very well known in common

3

law.

4

Congress recognizes a right, creates a right, if you

5

like, but a right well known in common law such as this

6

trust right, that it intends the ordinary and usual

7

remedy for breach of trust, unless it gives some

8

indication to the contrary, which it did not do in our

9

case.

10

We think that the proper presumption is that when

Of course, common law for a breach of trust,

damages is the absolutely regular remedy.

The eighth one, the final point I want to

20

make, is the intent of Congress that you found in the

21

Capoeman case — and Capoeman is one of the plaintiffs

22

in this case — that was a tax refund case, and you held

23

that there was an implied exemption to the federal

24

income tax because when Congress set thjese lands aside,

25

it did not intend that their value be depleted by taxes.

43

Well, it seems that vfe have the same situation

shouldn’t be depleted by federal mismanagement?

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

14

Do you have anything further?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA I. SCHWARTZ, ESQ.,

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL

16

MR. SCHWARTZ:

17
18
19

Very well.

Briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, two

points.
The first is that respondents' argument

20

proceeds as though the statutes in issue here expressly

21

declared a trust.

22

does not support that reading.

23

respondents' argument, the view is that these statutes

24

expanded the General Allotment Act trust;, but none of

25

the statutes refer to the General Allotment Act; and

That is not the case.

Their text

And as I understand

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

it's clear that all of the statutes apply to properties

2

that are not subject to the General Allotment Act.

3

The statutes are either adequate on their own

4

or not to create a damage remedy, and there's simply no

5

nexus that's apparent from the statutory language or the

6

legislative history that would suggest this was a

7

congressional attempt to expand the General Allotment

8

Act duties.

9

If I can return to the question of the

10

relationship between this and the private right of

11

action cases, we agree that there is much in common

12

between the two lines of analysis, and in both the rule

13

is, as the Court said in Touche Ross and Reddington, the

14

ultimate question is one of congressional intent.

15

the Court's refusal in Testan to go beyond that intent

16

speaks to the same kind of analysis.

17

And

But we would add that the private right of

18

action cases rarely distinguish between damages remedies

19

and injunctive remedies, and that because of the

20

background of sovereign immunity there's an extra layer

21

of — an extra requirement of special clarity that

22

Congress intended a damages remedy so that the showing

23

— the showing required in the ordinary private right of

24

action cases should be applied especially strictly in

25

this context.
