ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL A. ALITO, JR., ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. ALITO;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, since before the adoption of the

10

Fourth Amendment, Customs officers have been authorized

11

by federal statute to conduct suspicionless boardings of

12

vessels for the purpose of checking their documents.

13

The issue in this case is whether such boardings in

14

inland waters constitute unreasonable searches or

15

seizures.

16

The facts of this case may be briefly

17

summarized.

18

1980, a patrolling Customs officer spotted a 40-foot

19

sailboat equipped with a diesel engine, anchored about

20

18 miles inland, in the Calcasieu River Ship Channel,

21

which is a waterway connecting the Gulf of Mexico to the

22

Customs port of entry at Lake Charles, Louisiana.

23

At about 11:30 in the morning, in March,

The officer and those on board his boat had

24

never before seen a sailboat in that waterway, which is

25

traveled by large commercial vessels.

On the stern of

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the sailboat was the name of the vessel, the Henry

2

Morgan II, and its hailing port, "Basilea," which it

3

turns out is the Latin translation for Basel,

4

Switzerland.

5

name "Basilea," he correctly believed that it denoted a

6

foreign port.

Although the officer did not recognize the

7

At this time, a large freighter was heading up

8

the ship channel, and it created a huge wake that caused

9

the sailboat to rock so violently back and forth that it

10

appeared it was about to capsize.

In fact, at one point

11

the sailboat's mast actually- touched the water, and its

12

keel emerged from the water.
The Customs officer called out to Respondent

13
14

Hamparian, who was the only person visible on deck, and

15

asked if he was all right, but Hamparian merely shrugged

16

his shoulders, which suggested to the officer that he

17

was unable to speak English.

18

to board the vessel for the purpose of checking the

19

documents.

The officer then decided

He did so, and while examining the documents,

20

21

he detected the odor of burning marijuana.

He also saw

22

through an open hatch burlap-wrapped bales of what he

23

believed was marijuana.

24

arrested.

25

pounds of marijuana, with a street value of about $7

The Respondents were then

The boat was searched.

million, was seized
Respondents were convicted of drug offenses,

2
3

but their convictions were reversed by the Court of

4

Appeals on the ground that there was no reasonable

5

suspicion of criminal activity, and therefore the

6

officer was prohibited from boarding the vessel in

7

inland waters for the purpose of checking the documents.

8
9

With these facts in mind, it bears emphasis
that the only authority at issue in this case is the

10

authority to boari the vessel and check the documents,

11

and not the authority to search any other portion of the

12

craft.

13

was not a small American boat on an inland lake.

14

a seagoing foreign vessel on a ship channel connecting

15

the open sea with the Customs port of entry, and it was

16

located just a relatively short distance from the open

17

sea.

18

It also bears emphasis that the Henry tforgan II
It was

Our position, of course, is that suspicionless

19

boardings and inspections, whether on inland or Customs

20

waters, are reasonable, and therefore do not violate the

21

Fourth Amendment.

22

reasonableness that they were authorized by the First

23

Congress, which of course proposed the Bill of Rights to

24

the States, and they have been continuously authorized

25

by statute ever since.

It is strong evidence of their

1

Why is this so?

First, because there is

2

simply no other adequate alternative way of enforcing

3

the documentation laws, and the documentation laws serve

4

many vital functions.

They are the primary method of

5

identifying vessels.

They serve to regulate the entry

6

and departure of persons and goods traveling by water.

7

They are used in collecting import and tonnage duties,

8

in conserving natural resources, and promoting safe

9

shipping and boating.

10

QUESTION;

Hr. Alito, you have been addressing

11

the merits from the beginning.

NR. ALITOs

not moot.

QUESTION:

Wasn't it the government that got

the dismissal of the indictment?
HR. ALITO*

The government had the indictment

24

dismissed merely for the purpose of complying with the

25

Court of Appeals mandate, but I think this Court's

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

decisions establish that ministerial acts of that sort,

2

which --

4

QUESTION*

Instead of a dismissal, couldn't

you have sought a stay of mandate?
HR. ALITO*

5

We could have, Your Honor, and

6

that might have been a preferable procedure, but it is

7

merely a technical matter.
QUESTION:

8
9
10
11

Didn't you waive reinstatement by

the course you took, dismissing instead of getting a
stay?
HR. ALITO:

I don't think so. Your Honor.

12

believe that a reversal of the decision below would

13

permit the reinstatement of the indictment and the

14

convictions, and therefore —

15

QUESTION:

16
17
18

I

Would you have to reinstate the

indictment?
HR. ALITO:

I think you just reinstate the

con victions.

QUESTION:

And then the sentence, yes.

20

MR. ALITO:

And the sentence.

they are ever again found —

QUESTION:

MR. ALITO:

And then if

That is what your brief says.
That's correct, and I think that's

24

what would happen.

The dismissal of the indictment was

25

purely a technical matter, and it would certainly --

QUESTIONi

Are you aware of any cases in which

2

a conviction had been reinstated without the indictment

3

-- I mean, a conviction had been reinstated without an

4

indictment being in the case, in the record?

5

MR. ALITOi

Justice Stevens, I must confess, I

6

don't know what happens as a technical matter to the

7

indictment when the conviction is reinstated, but I

8

think that when —

QUESTIONS

I have never heard of it.

I have

thought about this quite a bit, and I can’t think of an

11

analogy.

12

are right about raootness.

13

you can have a conviction in a case where there is no

underlying pleading.

15

judgment in a case if nobody ever filed a complaint.

16

How can you have a conviction without an indictment?

17

I am not sure it is moot.

MR. ALITOs

I think maybe you

But I don't understand how

I mean, you couldn't enter a

indictment cannot be reinstated.

Has it ever been done, to your

22

knowledge, under this set of facts?

by this problem.

24
25

MR. ALITO;

I am just puzzled

I don't know whether it has been

done on this state of facts.

2

QUESTION;

You can’t cite us any case in which

it has been done?

3

MR. ALITO;

4

QUESTION;

5

Well, he was indicted, and he was

convicted while the indictment was outstanding.

6

MR. ALITO:

7

QUESTION:

8

I*m afraid I can't.

Certainly, he was.
Nobody disputes there was an

indictment at one time.

9

QUESTION:

And that — And the only

10

requirement for indictment is under — that he be

11

indicted before he is tried, isn't it?

12

MR. ALITO;

13

QUESTION;

I believe that is correct.
Well, I still don't understand.

14

Why did the government seek a dismissal of the

15

indictment.

16

MR. ALITO:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ALITO;

I believe it was done — it was -Why not a stay of the mandate?
I won’t dispute the fact that

19

that's probably the preferable alternative, but I don't

20

think that —
QUESTION;

21

22

Well, why was it -- why was

dismissal sought?
MR. ALITO:

23

As a fact, I don't know. Justice

24

Brennan.

I think it was done to comply with the Court

25

of Appeals mandate, at a time before the final decision

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to seek review in this Court was made

2

QUESTIONS

Did the Court of Appeals mandate

3

address itself to the indictment or merely set aside the

4

judgments?
SR. ALITO;

5

I believe it reversed and remanded

6

with instructions to take proceedings consistent with

7

the decision, and since the principal evidence at trial

8

was the evidence that had been suppressed, I believe

9

that —

10

QUESTION;

Is it your position that if you

11

were complying with the mandate of the Court of Appeals,

12

you can’t be charged with any waiver?

13

MR. ALITO;

I think that’s correct.

14

Otherwise, we would have to seek a stay in every case,

15

and if the stay was denied, every stay case in which it

16

was denied would have to go up to this Court, and if the

17

stay was not granted, the case would become moot.

18
19

QUESTION;

When the mandate went back down, it

went back down to the District Court, right?

20

MR. ALITO;

21

QUESTION;

22

MR. ALITO;

23

Yes, it did.
Well, who dismissed the indictment?
The District Court dismissed the

indictment.

24

QUESTION;

On whose motion?

25

MR. ALITO;

I don't know on whose motion.

I

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

know that we did not object to it.

2
3

QUESTION*

I had the impression it was on the

government’s motion.

4

QUESTION;

Me, too.

5

QUESTION;

Am I wrong?

6

QUESTION;

The government can't dismiss the

7

indictment, can it?
MR. ALITO;

8
9

It can

only move or not object to a defense motion.
QUESTION;

10
11

No, it certainly can't.

Well, do we know what the record

is, or not?
\

12
13

MR. ALITO;

Well, we know what the record is.

I don’t know —
QUESTION;

14

Certainly there is nothing in the

15

judgment of the Court of Appeals that in so many words

16

said that the indictment should be dismissed.
MR. ALITO;

17

That is certainly correct, but

18

when — in a case of this sort, when the convictions are

19

founded upon the discovery of contraband, the

20

suppression of that contraband necessarily means that

21

there will no longer have been -QUESTION*

22
23

that time of what happened in court?
MR. ALITO*

24
25

Was there some transcript made at

White.

I assume there was. Justice

I have not reviewed it.

And looking here at the

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

docket sheets, it is not clear which party moved for

2

dismissal of the indictment.

3

Respondent's argument on mootness is not based

4

on dismissal of the indictment.

5

that the — that Respondents had been deported, and it

6

is for that reason —

7

QUESTION:

It is based on the fact

Let me put it another way.

I

8

suppose you feel that the indictment is merged in the

9

judgment in any event.

10

QUESTIONi

11

MR. ALITO:

12

QUESTION:

13

That's what your brief says.
I believe the dismissal —
I think that’s a good way of

describing it.
MR. ALITO:

14

I don't think I can say more than

15

that the dismissal of the indictment was merely a

16

technical matter, done to comply with the Court of

17

Appeals mandate.
QUESTION:

18

All the Court of Appeals mandate

19

required was that you set aside the conviction and

20

suppress the evidence, which normally would lead to a

21

new trial.

22

dismissing the indictment.

23
24
25

I don't see why there was any requirement of

MR. ALITO:

There was not a requirement of

dismissing the indictment in a legal sense.
QUESTION:

You could have complied with the

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

mandate of the Court of Appeals without dismissing the

2

indictment.

3
4

MR. ALITO:

It would have meant an outstanding

indictment --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. ALITO:

Right.
-- which would have called for a

7

trial within a certain amount of time under the Speedy-

8

Trial Act, and if there could be no retrial, which in

9

fact there could not be, unless the decision suppressing

10

the evidence was reversed --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. ALITO:

Or stayed.
— or stayed, then compliance with

13

the Court of Appeals mandate as a practical matter would

14

have necessitated dismissal of the indictment.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

No, it would have necessitated a

motion for a stay.
MR. ALITO:

Well, that's right, Justice

18

Stevens, but our position is that making such a stay

19

motion is not necessary to preserve a live controversy.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

Well, but you don't have any

authority for that proposition.
MR. ALITO:

Well, we don't have authority for

23

that proposition because it was not Respondent's

24

contention at any point that dismissal of the indictment

25

was what mooted this case.

Their argument was that

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

deportation is what mooted the case.

2

QUESTION!

Well, you hope to make some

3

authoritiy for that.

4

HR. ALITO;

5

Well, at the minimum, we hope to

make authority for that, Justice White.

6

QUESTION;

It wouldn’t necessarily follow that

7

there would be a new trial, if the only evidence the

8

government had was the evidence that was suppressed.

9

The government routinely dismisses indictments, or just

10

doesn’t pursue an outstanding indictment.
HR. ALITO;

11

That is certainly correct. Hr.

12

Chief Justice.

13

the evidence meant dismissal of the indictment.

They just don’t prosecute it.

HR. ALITO;

As a practical matter, suppression of

Well, I believe at a certain point

there is a motion to dismiss the indictment.
QUESTION;

19

Well, I thought you told Justice

20

Stevens that you couldn’t name a single case where the

21

indictment was dismissed.
HR. ALITO:

22
23

We

would be happy to brief the issue.
QUESTION;

24
25

I can't name one offhand.

How can you say it if you can’t

name one?

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

SR. ALITO*

Well, what I am saying is that

2

when critical evidence is suppressed and a case is

3

remanded to the District Court, the indictment is

4

dismissed because a new trial is impractical, and that

5

was what happened here, and I am sure that is what the

6

Court of Appeals understood was going to happen when

7

they decided this case.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION*

And that was consistent with the --

if not ordered, it was certainly consistent with the
mandate of the Court of Appeals?
QUESTION*

Well, supposing you had a civil

12

case where plaintiff got a judgment in a negligence

13

case, and the appellate court set it aside and sent it

14

back for a new trial, and the plaintiff went in and

15

moved to dismiss his complaint.

16

judgment after the complaint was dismissed?

17

WE. ALITOs

Could you reinstate the

I believe there are cases that

18

would permit reinstatement of the complaint after --

19

after that.

20
21

22

QUESTION;

After the prevailing party moved to

dismiss his own complaint?
HR. ALITOs

I believe if that was done truly

23

to comply with the mandate of an appellate court

24

reversing --

25

QUESTION:

But it wasn’t necessary to comply

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

with the mandate.

2

sent it back for a new trial, you don't have to go in

3

and dismiss the complaint.

4

It clearly wasn't necessary.

MR. ALITO:

If it

Well, if the practical effect of

5

the appellate ruling is to make any further proceedings

6

in the trial court impossible, I think —

7

8

QUESTION:

Counsel, let's get on with the

merits of the case now.

9

MR. ALITO:

Thank you.

10

As I was saying, there are two reasons why

11

suspicionless boardings and document inspections are

12

necessary.

First -QUESTION:

13

Excuse me, Mr. Alito.

May I ask

14

you, in that respect, did the government argue in the

15

Fifth Circuit that no reasonable suspicion was required

16

or only that the officers in fact had reasonable

17

suspicion?

18
19

20
21

22
23

Which was it?
MR. ALITO:

We certainly raised the question

of whether reasonable suspicion was required.
QUESTION:

Well, what did you argue?

Did you

argue one or both?
MR. ALITO:

We argued — in our petition for

rehearing, we argued both points.

24

QUESTION:

By that, the original argument?

25

MR. ALITO:

Initially before the trial we

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

merely argued that reasonable suspicion was present, but

2

we did that for two good reasons.

3

Court had found that there was reasonable suspicion.

4

believed he was correct.

5

correct.

6

First, the District
We

We still believe he was

Second, and more important, there were prior

7

binding Fifth Circuit cases holding that reasonable

8

suspicion was needed for boarding in inland waters, and

9

therefore we saw no need to urge affirmance of the

10

District Court decision on the ground that prior

11

decisions binding on the panel ought to be reversed, but

12

after the panel rendered its decision, then we raised

13

the issue of whether reasonable suspicion was needed in

14

our petition for rehearing.

15

There are no other adequate means of enforcing

16

the documentation laws besides suspicionless boardings.

17

In addition, because of the long history of pervasive

18

federal regulation of most aspects of maritime activity,

19

persons aboard vessels within the jurisdiction of the

20

United States have a greatly reduced expectation of

21

privacy, especially with respect to the vessel's

22

documents.

23

Let me first —

24

QUESTION;

25

Does this case fit within the

border exception?

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. ALITO*

It does not fit within the classic

2

border exception, but we believe it is necessary to

3

effectively police the sea border.

4

nothing but an imaginary line three miles from the

5

coast.

6

check, is allowed only when there is reasonable suspicion

7

to believe that a vessel has crossed the border, that is

8

an impossible standard.

9

actually observes the vessel crossing the border, he

The sea border is

Now, if a suspicionless boarding and document

Unless the Customs officer

10

will usually have no way of detecting whether a border

11

crossing has taken place.

12

QUESTION*

You think that the foreign

13

registration of the vessel would not be sufficient, I

14

mean, the obvious markings from the outside of the

15

vessel showing it's a foreign vessel?

16

MR. ALITOs

Well, we believe that any foreign

17

— persons on any foreign vessel within United States

18

waters have no legitimate expectation of privacy, at

19

least with respect to their documents.

analogize this too closely to border searches on land,

because the sea is simply not like the land.

You can make a border search of an airplane

MR. ALITO:

in fact crossed the border, and with scheduled airlines,

No, I would suppose that someone

And this includes the health

all of these important national functions, and this is

so because there is simply no other way of effectively

enforcing the documentation laws.

simply not satisfactory.

3

They are not very revealing, especially in the case of a

would be satisfactory.

take the word of the persons on board.

12

Checking the documents only in the case where

there is reasonable suspicion of a border crossing, as I

have tried to show, is also not acceptable, nor is it

Let me now explain very briefly why

suspicionless boardings and inspections of vessels

entail a much lesser intrusion upon protected privacy

14

interests than land inspections to which they are

First of all, when a documentation check is

made, a vessel is detained only briefly, if at all.

5

seizure than any statute which has previously come

7

is even broader than the statute that was before the

There was a limitation on these broad powers that were

3

placed — that Customs agents enjoyed placed on it by

4

the Fifth Circuit.

5

I think very definitely that the true nature

6

of this particular patrol is important in this case.

7

First of all, insofar as the facts are concerned, this

8

patrol was instigated and executed because of

9

information which a Customs agent had received on the

10

prior day, on March 5th, 1980, that there were two

11

vessels in the Hackberry, Louisiana, area laden with

12

marijuana.

13

Pursuant to that information, this patrol was

14

formed, which included not only D.S. Customs agents, but

15

included Louisiana State Police narcotics agents.

16

documents.

24

what motive the investigators had?

prosecution, the competing interests of the government

4

and the individual are changed.

MR. IEYOUBi

But --

Indicate is enough?
I am sorry, Your Honor?
Indicate is enough?
I think in this case if you take

8

all of the facts as they are presented, and as the

9

testimony indicated, that it should lead to a

10

conclusion. Your Honors, that it was in fact a criminal

11

investigatory search.

12

QUESTION;

Do you say that when these officers

13

stood on the deck of this craft, they were there

14

illegally?

15

MR. IEY0UB:

16

QUESTIONi

Absolutely, Your Honor.
And when they detected the odor of

17

burning marijuana, they could not legally do anything

18

about it?

19

MR. IEYOUBs

20

QUESTION;

Well, that —
Or could they take the vessel in

21

tow, and take them to a United States magistrate and get

22

a warrant?

23

MR. IEYOUBi

I think they could have done

24

that, Your Honor.

The question, I think, in this case

25

was whether or not the boarding was legal, and not

36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

whether or not — although I did contest that the search

2

that took place after the boarding was illegal.

3

Fifth Circuit did not decide that particular question.

4

The Fifth Circuit only held that the boarding itself was

5

unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

6

QUESTIONS

Because of the lack of some kind of

7

reasonable suspicion.

8

HR. IEYOtJBs

9

Your Honor.

The

That’s correct.

That's correct,

The situation — even if we assume that the

10

government, as the government contends, that the

11

boarding in this case was purely an administrative

12

documentation check, only in very unique and limited

13

circumstances may even an administrative inspection or

14

search of private premises be accomplished with an

15

administrative warrant — without an administrative

16

warrant or without a valid substitute therefore.

17

think the government tried to argue that this particular

18

inspection fell under the Colonnade-Biswell exception.

19

I

But this particular exception was a very

20

narrow exception to the general rule, which requires a

21

warrant for administrative inspections of residential

22

and commercial premises.

23

warrantless regulatory searches of a pervasively

24

regulated business to further an urgent federal

25

interest, by statute.

The exception allowed

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

However, the statute is very limiting in these

2

particular types of cases.

3

scope, and place of these types of searches, and unless

4

you have a valid statute which carefully and narrowly

5

limits these particular inspections, then you need

6

either an administrative warrant or some substitution

7

for an administrative warrant, which we suggest in this

8

case would be a reasonable suspicion of a law

9

violation.

10

QUESTION*

The statute limits the time,

Are there different factors that

11

play, though, when you are dealing with vessels on open

12

waters which just don’t lend themselves to staying put

13

long enough to go get your administrative warrant?

14

MR. IEYOUBs

Your Honor, I think insofar as

15

that is concerned, that vessels, with respect to your

16

particular answer, vessels are not that much different

17

in mobility certainly than automobiles are.

Well, but, of course, with vessels

11

could have been that type of thing in the Calcasieu Ship

13

could have been a check point type situation.

There

14

Besides that, insofar as the documentation

15

checks go, and insofar as the documentation laws and

16

other regulatory objectives of this particular statute

17

go, the minimal or the minimum — it certainly would not

18

benefit that much, random, suspicionless, warrantless

19

boardings of vessels would not necessarily benefit the

20

documentation laws to such an extent that it would

21

outweigh the tremendous possibility of abuse and threat

22

to the privacy of the individual that this statute

23

allows.

24
25

I think in Biswell, the Court stated that if
the statute offers a great possibility of abuse, and

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

there is a tremendous threat to the privacy of the

MR. IEY0UB;

There is less of

There is less fear that might

And in that respect, it follows the

Martinez-Fuerte rationale, that permanent check points

23

are not as much an intrusion into the privacy of the

individual as a roving patrol that makes random

25

suspicionless searches.

And that is the difference

Insofar as the border search is

that has been historically true, and the decisions of

this Court have so held for many years, but this was not

because the Fifth Circuit has held that way.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

The

Do you have anything --

14

Your time is not up.

15

MR. ALITOs

16

The only other point I would like to add, Mr.

I am sorry.

17

Chief Justice, was that the crux of this case is that

18

until a documentation inspection is conducted, it is not

19

possible to know what sort of vessel Customs is dealing

20

with, and that is why it’s necessary, and that is

21

illustrated graphically by this particular case.

22

Here, if the Henry Morgan II had been a

23

documented boat from Basilea, Louisiana, or Mississippi,

24

or Alaska, it would have had exactly the same markings,

25

and here, a Customs patrol in a Louisiana ship channel

60

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

came across a boat that bore the outward markings of a

2

landlocked country 5,000 miles away.

3

was written in Latin, and although the vessel bore Swiss

4

markings, it was actually of French registry.

The hailing port

5

Because situations like this come up all the

6

time, it is necessary to conduct a documentation check

7

to determine whether any further procedures, including a

8

full-scale border search, is appropriate.

9

QUESTIONS

Well, in your submission, it sounds

10

like, your most recent one, anyway, is that on the facts

11

of this case, this boarding was all right,

12

aren't pushing for any kind of a rule that you can

13

search any -- you can board any vessel that you find

14

anchored 18 miles off the coast.
MR. ALIT0;

15

but that you

No, I believe it is necessary to

16

do that, because until you inspect the documents, you

17

cannot --

18

QUESTION;

So you are saying any vessel you

19

find anchored or under way 18 miles off the coast or any

20

distance off the coast, for that matter, you can stop

21

and make a document check?

22

MR. ALIT0:

We believe the statute is

23

constitutional, and that is what it provides.

24

suggestion as to whether or not a search could be made

HR. ALITOs

21

A search could be made 100 miles

by Courts of Appeals based upon reasoning analogous to

the arguments we have advanced in this case.
