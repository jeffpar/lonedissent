ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. GARVEY, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS,

7

JAMES G. WATT, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, ET AL.

8

MR. GARVEY;

9
10

Mr. Garvey, you may proceed whenever you

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court;
The issue in this case is whether gravel

11
12

deposits which are susceptible to commercial

13

exploitation are reserved to the United States under the

14

Mineral Reservation and the Stock-Raising Homestead

15

Act.

16

about 12 miles south of Jeffrey City, Wyoming, a company

17

town where its workers live.

18

a mile or two northeast of the town.

19

Respondent, Western Nuclear, owns a uranium mine

It also mills the uranium

From the time in the early 1950s when Western

20

Nuclear first located in this area, it acquired gravel

21

for its various needs in Lander, Wyoming, about 65 miles

22

away, and in Casper, Wyoming, about 85 miles away.

23

In 1975, finding that method of acquisition a

24

little expensive, it acquired part of some land about a

25

mile north of Jeffrey City where there was a deposit of

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

gravel.

2

yards of gravel from that deposit, or about 60,000 tons.

3

which it used for making cement to line the sides of its

4

mineshafts, for concrete aggregate for lining the

5

streets and the sidewalks in Jeffrey City and for

6

building roads on which to haul its ore.

7

Respondent thereafter mined about 43,000 cubic

The land on which the gravel deposit was

8

located had been patented in 1926, under the

9

Stock-Raising Homestead Act.

10
11

QUESTION*

At that time had the modified

definition been reached by the Interior Department?

12

MR. GARVEY *

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. GARVEYi

It was in 1929 that the —
’29.
— Department of the Interior

15

decided layman against Ellis.

16

was at stake in Layman against Ellis had been first

17

located in 1925.

18

The Homestead claim which

When the Bureau of Land Management learned of

19

the appropriation of the gravel deposit, it informed

20

respondent that its appropriation of the gravel was a

21

trespass against the mineral interests of the United

22

States reserved under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act

23

and, after undertaking an appraisal of the property,

24

concluded that respondent was liable in the amount of

25

513,000 for royalties for the gravel taken.

1

QUESTION*

Mr. Garvey, was this the first time

2

that the government had brought such an action against

3

claimant or user of gravel under the Farmers and

4

Stockmen's Act — Stockmen's Homestead Act?

5

MB. GARVEY*

To my knowledge, it was the first

6

such action, although I should say that the history of

7

the government's enforcement of this — of these rights

8

is a little like what Mark Twain said about Wagner's

9

music, it's actually better than it sounds.

10

MR. GARVEY*

Until 1955 these kinds of gravel

11

deposits were not sold but were locatable under the

12

Mining Act of 1872 and they —

13

QUESTION:

Until when?

14

MR. GARVEY*

1955.

And so anybody who wanted

15

to acquire these deposits could just go on the land and

16

take them with — after making accommodations with the

17

homesteader.

18

After 1955, in fact, in 1957, promptly after

19

the Common Varieties Act, which permitted sale of these

20

deposits was passed, the Solicitor of Interior in a

21

Solicitor's opinion addressed to the Director in Denver

22

said that passage of this act shouldn't be understood to

23

have relinquished the government's interest in gravel

24

deposits on Stock-Raising Homestead Act lands.

25

the Common Varieties Act did was to change the method of

All that

2

disposal from location to sale.
find although it's difficult to say to what

3

extent the people seeking gravel deposits on

4

Stock-Raising Homestead Act lands actually get

5

permission of the Department because of the way the

6

records are kept in the resource area — there isn’t any

7

-- there isn’t any separate line on the form that they

8

fill out to say what kind of lands gravel deposits are

9

taken from — I notice that in the Trujillo case, on

10

which respondent in the Court of Appeals relied, that

11

the State of New Mexico in 1971 had acquired a permit

12

from the Bureau of Land Management to acquire gravel

13

deposits on Stock-Raising Homestead Act lands.

14

QUESTION*

Well, I suppose a lot of holders of

15

land patented under the Stock Raisers Act simply go

16

ahead and use the gravel, or have in the past, on the

17

assumption that it’s not a mineral.

18

MR. GARVEY*

That’s entirely possible.

And

19

it’s also the case that the enforcement resources of the

20

Bureau of Land Management are not such that they are

21

able to police the use that’s made of these deposits.

22

QUESTION:

So, so far as you know, from the

23

time of 1916, when the Stock Raisers Act was passed,

24

until the bringing of this action was the first time the

25

government had ever brought an action in court asserting

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that it retained title to gravel because it was a

2

reserved mineral under the Stock Raisers Act?

3

MR. GARVEY*

4

QUESTION*

So far as I know, that's correct.
But is the government's position

5

narrow, that that — that on these, where the government

6

reserves minerals on this kind of land, that it's a

7

trespass for the rancher or owner to use any gravel?

8

I thought you were now limiting —

9

MR. GARVEY*
QUESTION*

10

11

In the District Court —
-- your claim to commercial

deposits.
MR. GARVEY*

12

In the District Court — it's not

13

that we are now limiting our claim.

14

been the issue right along.
QUESTION*

15

In fact, that has

In the District —

So — so anyway, you -- whenever

16

you made your position clear, it is now your position at

17

least that the — it's only commercial deposits that is

18

at issue?

19

MR. GARVEY*

20

QUESTION*

21

22
23

That's correct.
So you mean commercial use.

Suppose it's a commercial deposit.
MR. GARVEY*

But the stock-raising homesteader

makes use of it?

24

QUESTION*

Yes.

25

MR. GARVEY*

But not commercially.

That was — that issue was left

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

open in the District Court, and I am not in a position

2

to concede on behalf of the Department that those

3

deposits don't —

4

QUESTION:

Well, not —

5

MR. GARVEY;

— belong, although if — it may

6

be that the government could permit free use to the

7

Stock-Raising Homestead Act —
QUESTION:

8
9

Well, there are a lot of

noncommercial deposits of gravel around, and the —

10

certainly, you concede that the rancher’s or

11

homesteader's use of that gravel is permissible?

12

HR. GARVEY:

13

QUESTION:

14

Indeed.

If the deposit —

As a matter of fact, it doesn't

even belong to the government.

15

MR. GARVEY:

16

QUESTION:

That's right.
Well, has the federal mining law

17

ever treated something that was arguably a mineral as a

18

mineral when it's found commercially but not a mineral

19

when it's not found or used commercially?
QUESTION:

20

Well, you can't even get a — you

21

can't patent your mining claim unless it's a commercial

22

deposit.

23
24
25

MR. GARVEY:
valuable mineral.
QUESTION:

Unless it's -- unless it is a

Under the mining law —
Yes, but that -- that depends on

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

whether you can properly locate.

That doesn’t — the

2

definition of mineral has never turned on whether

3

something —

4

QUESTION:

No, no.

5

QUESTION:

— was commercially used.

6

MR. GARVEY*

That is correct, although you

7

have to bear in mind that under the mining law — what

8

the Mining Act of 1872, for example, is talking about

9

deposits on — on lands which the government owns in

10

fee, so that it’s possible to speak of minerals without

11

taking any account of how much of the mineral is on the

12

land .

3

On the other hand, where the government has

4

severed the surface estate from the mineral estate, it's

5

difficult to speak of — to say that the government has

6

retained an interest in all minerals in the land simply

7

because it would be virtually impossible for anybody on

8

the sufrace to make any use of the surface without

9

somehow interfering with some of the minerals that --

20

QUESTION:

Well, but under the 1906 Act, or

2

*16 Act, there certainly have been numerous instances,

22

have there not, of entries by private individuals on

23

land that was open -- but where the subsurface was open

24

to entry who proposed to become mineral claimants?

25

MR. GARVEY*

Certainly.

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION;

1

And there as in other branches of

2

the mineral/ I have never known of a court case that

3

said the definition of a mineral turns on the degree to

4

which it's commercially used.
MR. GARVEY;

5

We don't maintain that the

6

definition of a mineral turns on whether it’s

7

commercially usable.

8

which the government is interested under the

9

Stock-Raising Homestead Acts are minerals which it is

10

able to dispose of separately and which have some use

11

apart from the land on which they're found.
QUESTION;

12

We rather say that the minerals in

Well, it is your contention that

13

the reservation of minerals under the 1916 Act included

14

all gravel?
MR. GARVEYs

15
16

has to reach —
QUESTION!

17
18

Well, I am interested in reaching

it right now by a yes-or-no answer from you, if I could.

19

MR. GARVEY;

20

QUESTION;

21

I don’t know whether the Court

Okay.
You have already answered it once,

and you —
MR. GARVEY;

22

It’s — it’s a little bit more

23

complex.

As the passage of the Materials Act in

1947

24

made clear, there were some kinds of gravel that were

25

locatable under the Mining Act and some kinds of gravel

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that were not.

2

two types was that the kinds of gravel which were useful

3

for making concrete for paving, for making cinder block,

4

were reserved.

5

for purposes of fill or riprap -- that is to say, large

6

chunks six or eight inches in diameter — were not

7

disposable under the Mining Act.

8

considered minerals.

9

Essentially, the distinction between the

The kinds of gravel which were useful

Those kinds were not

The reason I said the Court needn’t reach that

10

question in this case is that the kinds of gravel which

11

respondent was using are the kinds of gravel that were

12

disposable under the Mining Act.

13

which are useful for purposes of fill or for riprap are

14

a question which the Court needn't reach in this case.

15
16
17

QUESTIONi

Those other kinds

Well, why do you say one is

’’disposable” under the Mineral Act and the other not?
MR. GARVEY*

One was locatable as a mineral

18

under the Mining Act of 1872.

19

of gravel on the land in deposits sufficiently valuable

20

to justify a location would permit somebody to go on the

21

land with respect to location.

22

QUESTION*

The presence of that kind

Mr. Garvey, with respect to that

23

kind of gravel, what is your answer to Justice

24

Rehnquist’s question?

25

MR. GARVEY:

I would say that the

11

Stock-Raising Homestead Act leaves open the possibility

2

that that sort of gravel can be considered —

3

QUESTION;

4

HR. GARVEY;

5

QUESTION;

6

NR. GARVEY;

7

QUESTION;

8

MR. GARVEY;

9

Can you answer it yes or no?
Yes.
Yes?
The acts —
You think they do reserve it all?
The act says in the second

sentence that the disposal of the mineral deposits on

10

the land shall be subject to disposal in accordance with

11

the provisions of the mineral land laws in force at the

12

time of such disposal, which means that even though it

13

may not have been disposable in 1916 it could well have

14

become disposable and hence included within the mineral

15

reservation with the passage of the Materials Act.

16

QUESTION;

Well, how will a rancher know

17

whether a particular gravel is commercially — of

18

commercial quality or not?

19

Department of the Interior and get a ruling before he

20

makes any use of it himself?

21
22

23
24
25

MR. GARVEY;

Does he have to go to the

If he were in doubt, he could

certainly ask the Bureau of Land Management.
QUESTION;

And perhaps commercial use that is

unknown today may exist a few years from now?
MR. GARVEY;

It’s entirely possible, although

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

I should point out that in that respect gravel is not

2

different from other kinds of minerals under the Mining

3

Act or under the — under the mining laws in general.

4

In 1915, a year before this act was passed, the

5

Department of the Interior held that bauxite was not a

6

locatable mineral even though it was known that bauxite

7

contained uranium, simply because at that time there

8

wasn't the technological process for extracting uranium

9

from bauxite.

10

I doubt whether that would be followed

today.
Or, to take another example, in 1949 Congress

11
12

said that people were going on Stock-Raising Homestead

13

Act lands in order to mine bentonite, which is used for

14

drilling mud or for a process for collecting iron ore

15

called taconite pellitizing.

16

wasn't used for those purposes in 1916, Congress

17

recognized in 1949 that those had become minerals which

18

would justify entry on stock Raising Homestead Acts from

19

-- Act lands for mining purposes.

20

matter.

21

QUESTION*

And although bentonite

Or uranium, for that

In other words, before 1916 or

22

whenever this first decision was made, or before the

23

'29, whatever is the ore from which nuclear material is

24

extracted would not have been regarded as a valuable

25

mineral in that time, would it?

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

MR. GARVEY;

I was unable to find

I am

2

cases holding to that effect, undoubtedly because nobody

3

had any use for the material.

4

considered a mineral.

5

considered a valuable mineral at that time.
QUESTION;

6

It may well have been

I doubt that it would have been

Didn't we have a case within recent

7

years where it turned to some extent on the adjective

8

"valuable” mineral, which -MR. GARVEYs

9
10

QUESTION*

11

MR. GARVEY*

Correct.
— considers that -In Andrus against Shell Oil this

12

Court decided that the interpretation of the mineral

13

leasing Act of 1920 since the time of its passage by the

14

Secretary of the Interior and by Congress suggested that

15

oil shale was a valuable mineral before 1920 and so

16

locatable under the Mining Act.

17

in this case is much the same, that the consistent

18

interpretation both by the Secretary and by Congress

19

since passage of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act in that

20

case .

21

QUESTION*

What we are maintaining

Well, how can you refer to a

22

consistent interpretation when you have the gravel

23

opinion sometime in the early teens, I think it was, and

24

then the turnabout in 1929?

25

MR. GARVEY;

I — I qualified my statement by

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

saying that the consistent interpretation since the

2

passage of the act.

3

against Brunson the Secretary held that gravel deposits,

4

much like the gravel deposits in this case, would not

5

disqualify land from being homesteaded because they

6

should not be considered to make the land valuable for

7

minerals.

8
9
10
11
12

13

There is no doubt that in Zimmerman

I would suggest that when Congress passed the
act in 1916, it may well have thought differently had it
addressed the question about whether gravel was —
QUESTIONS

But that, Zimmerman was on the

books when that was passed.
MR. GARVEY:

That’s correct.

Zimmerman was on

14

the books for 6 years at the time the act was passed.

15

But I might say that the decisions of this Court in

16

cases like Northern Pacific against Soderburg had held

17

that granite was a mineral reserved from the lands given

18

to the Northern Pacific Railway, that the U.S.

19

Geological Survey in 1913, 3 years after Zimmerman, had

20

said that the presence of gravel deposits on land could

21

make them lands valuable for minerals and so disposable

22

under the mining laws.

23

Even the other decisions of the Secretary of

24

the Interior at the time Zimmerman was decided suggested

25

that materials like pumice and granite, which like

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

gravel are now held as disposable under the Common

2

Varieties Act, would make the land valuable for minerals

3

But quite apart from all of that, the question

4

in Zimmerman against Brunson was whether the land should

5

be used for homesteading purposes or for mining

6

purposes.

7

mining location, you got everything, the surface and the

8

minerals.

At that time if you got a homestead or a

11

circumstances —
QUESTION;

12

Under those

You think Congress intended a

13

different definition of mineral in the Stock Raisers Act

14

than it did in the Mining Act of 1872?
MR. GARVEYs

15
16

too strongly.
QUESTION;

17
18

I don't want to press the point

Can't you answer any question yes

or no, Counsel?
MR. GARVEY;

19

I think that Congress certainly

20

meant to include in the Stock-Raising Homestead Act

21

those minerals that were locatable under the mining

22

law.

23

that Congress intended to leave open the possibility

24

that the mineral reservation would be elastic in the

25

sense that it could expand or contract.

I also think in the second sentence of the act

16
ALDERS0N REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION!

1

2

What about the granite that you

just mentioned, what is the status of granite?
SB. GARVEYs

3

I assume that it is now

4

locatable, that it is now subject to disposal under the

5

Common Varieties Act, which speaks of common varieties

6

of stone.

7

now be still locatable under the Mining Act.
QUESTIONS

8

9

Granite deposits in uncommon varieties would

that?

Well, what is the consequence of

Would they be classified as minerals or not?
MR. GARVEY;

10

The passage of the Common

11

Varieties Act in 1955 did not act as a quit claim to the

12

government's interest in these kinds of minerals.
What it did, rather, was simply to change the

13
14

method of disposal of these minerals from location under

15

the mining law to sale, because Congress expressed a

16

concern that people who were locating common varieties

17

of minerals weren't developing them in the way in which

18

the Mining Act intended, much as, if I may draw an

19

analogy, in passing the Mineral Leasing Act in 1920,

20

what Congress did was to change the method of disposal

21

of oil deposits, for example, from location under the

22

mining law to leasing under the Mineral Leasing Act of

23

1920.

24

those minerals, it simply provided a different method

25

for disposing of them.

It didn't give up the government's interest in

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION*

1

May I ask one other question while

2

you pause.

As I understand it, the government's view is

3

that although it will only assert a trespass claim when

4

the gravel has commercial value, in fact it retains an

5

Yes.
Is that your so-called free-use

theory, or is that something else?
MR. GARVEY:

No.

What we were speaking of

when we talked about free use were commercially

exploitable deposits of gravel which in fact belong to

the United States and not to the rancher.

the patent owner can make free use of the commercially

Not the patent owner.

related to the purposes of the act may make free use of

That’s correct.

It’s not a —

11

it’s not a distinction between prior and subsequent

patent owners but rather the use to which the gravel is

put.

ranchers to make free use of gravel doesn't mean that if

I am asking you whether as a

Would you say that the government does not have

MR. GARVEY;

I would say that the government

12

does not have an ownership interest in the aluminum

13

unless there is some -- unless it is there in sufficient

14

quantities to make it possible for the government to

15

dispose of it.

16

The reason the government is taking this

17

position is that in passing the Stock-Raising Homestead

18

Act, what the government intended to do was to make

19

multiple use of these semiarid lands in the West.

20

use that it wanted to make of the lands was to encourage

experience and efforts being in the line of stock

11

wanted to make.

12

That's one use the government

And the other use that the government wanted

13

to make was to develop the mineral estate.

14

lot of concern expressed at the time of the passage that

15

the — that the lands being given away, 640 acres or one

16

square mile, might, again in the words of the report,

17

might withdraw immense areas from prospecting and

18

mineral development.

19

There was a

And so whenever they talk about the size of

20

the estate being given away, they're careful to say that

21

all minerals are reserved.

22

Now, what the government tried to do in making

23

multiple use of the lands like that was to define the

24

estates that it was giving to the — to the surface

25

owner and to the mineral entry man in terms of the

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

intended use to be made of the property.
It doesn't make sense for the government to

2
3

claim that it retains and can prevent any use by the

4

stock-raising homesteader of minerals that appear on the

5

land in traces insufficient to justify disposal by any

6

means.

7

QUESTION*

Well, let me question that.

The

8

literal language reserves to the United States all the

9

coal, but you say that doesn't really mean all the coal,

10

it only means all the commercially valuable coal.

11

that correct?

12

MR. GARVEY*

13

QUESTION*

Is

That's correct.
So with each time a stockyard

14

patentee comes across any trace of coal on his land,

15

he's got to wonder whether it belongs to the government

16

or belongs to him, and he's got to make a judgment

17

whether it's, quote, commercially valuable?

18

MR. GARVEY*

That's correct, although I should

19

say that with respect to coal, as with respect to gravel

20

in this case, even under the Coal Lands Acts, like the

21

Act of 1909, 1910, 1912, the government recognized

22

explicitly in the case of the 1909 and 1910 Acts and by

23

decision of the Secretary in the case of the 1912 Act,

24

that people on the land could make use of the coal for

25

domestic purposes.

They were simply not allowed to sell

2

that concern wouldn't arise.

QUESTION:

So in a lot of cases,

Is a mineral reservation, or was

the mineral reservation, the same in these grants to the

Great Northern and Northern Pacific and the other

railroads to every other section?

KB. GARVEY:

I believe that the language may

have been similar.

9

10

I think they spoke then of mineral

QUESTION:

I vaguely recall in some other case

11

a great concern in Congress at the time they were making

12

these grants, that there was some objection on the

13

grounds that this was a give-away of very valuable

14

public property.

15

MR. GARVEY:

That was in fact the reason for

16

making the mineral reservation, and the railroads were

17

entitled to choose other lands when —

18

QUESTION:

So that the railroads could use it

19

for running a railroad and the farmers and ranchers were

given this grant free in order to use it for farming or

ranching purposes but not other purposes.

22

oversimplification?

MR. GARVEY:

Is that an

correct, although the government doesn’t maintain that

reserved gravel in its mineral reservation of all coal

I think the case law and the legislative

history is particularly important to look at, the

condition of the country at the time and what Congress

7

was intending to do when it passed the 1916

9

between 1900 and 1910 President Roosevelt withdrew

You will recall that

10

approximately 150 million acres of public lands from

entry, both agricultural and mineral.
Subsequent to that time, in 1907, President

12

Roosevelt urged Congress to pass legislation which would

14

provide for a distinct title to the surface and reserve

to the government underlying fuel and minerals.
Congress commenced passage of legislation in

19

as has been stated, for 640 acres rather than the normal

broader than that?

Did they intend to reserve

It was a case that arose in

record in that case, the description in that case by the

production of gravel and about how much more valuable it

6

has become in 1929 than it was in the prior decade.

It was decided in or about Los Angeles.

The

7

So that administrative tribunal I think was

8

persuaded by some excellent advocacy on perhaps -- on

9

behalf of the mineral claimant when the mineral claimant
«

10

kept stressing that it had now become valuable, it had

11

now become valuable, and therefore decided it was a

12

mineral sua sponte and forgot to worry about deciding

13

whether it was a mineral ab initio but just decided it

14

was because it was valuable.
QUESTION;

15

You think as a matter of law Layman

16

was just wrong or that they — the tribunal was without

17

authority to decide that way because — because

18

Zimmerman — that Zimmerman was beyond reach?
HR. SHAVER;

19

MR. SHAVER:

I think that in 1916 as well as

in 1872, if you will allow me, Hr. Chief Justice, to

give a little bit longer answer to a short question,

that one cannot say the mineral reservation contemplated

1

Kr. Shaver, do you agree with the

2

Solicitor Seneral, however, that under the 1872 Mineral

3

Location Act that valuable, commercially valuable,

4

gravel deposits could have been located under that act

5

even at the time of Zimmerman?
MR. SHAVERs

6

Absolutely not. Justice

7

O'Connor.

What the mining law provided and what was in

8

the departmental decisions is the common varieties of

9

special distinct characteristics could be located under

10

the mining laws.

We can see an example today.

Clay has

11

never been locatable under the mining laws.

12

bentonite may be.

13

locatable under the mining laws until Layman, and sand

14

has probably not been locatable unless it possesses

15

special and distinct characteristics such as for the

16

making of lead crystal.

However,

Sand and gravel has never been

to the contrary.

HR. SHAVER:

considered nor were other common surface constituents

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. GARVEY, ESQ.,

19

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS, JAMES G. WATT,

20
21

SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, ET AL. -- REBUTTAL
MR. GARVEYs

I would just like to make three

22

brief points.

The first is in the Court of Appeals,

23

respondent's brief at page 2 said, in March of 1975 in

24

order to obtain a ready and convenient source of gravel

25

and for other purposes. Western Nuclear acquired in fee

49
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

a substantial piece of ranch property which included the

2

subject land.

3

The second point that I would like to make is

4

there has been some uncertainty about the purpose and

5

effect of the Materials Act of 1947 and its predecessor,

6

the Act of 1944, for disposing of gravel which could not

7

otherwise be disposed of.

8

Justice Behnquist asked at the beginning of my

9

argument whether the government claimed all gravel under

10

its reservation in the Stock-Raising Homestead Act.

11

I hesitated because until 1944 gravel in deposits,

12

gravel useful for purposes of fill or riprap or uses

13

like that rather than gravel useful for making concrete

14

and hot-mix aggregate was not locatable under the mining

15

laws and there was no way of disposing of that kind of

16

gravel at the time.

17

And

The reason I hesitated in saying that the

18

government does — needn't claim all gravel in this case

19

is that the kind of gravel which is at stake in this

20

case is the kind of gravel that was locatable under the

21

mining laws and could be disposed of before 1944.

22

Justice O'Connor, you asked whether the

23

government was saying that this kind of gravel was not

24

common variety gravel.

25

government admits that it was common variety gravel in

The government does — the

the sense in which the 1955 Act uses the word "common

2

variety."

3

under the Mining Act of 1872.

That is not to say that it was not locatable

The third point I would like to make relates

4
5

to Justice Brennan's concern about this question not

having been raised before.

statement there made in the connection with an oral

18

argument?
MR. GARVEY:

19

It was made in connection with a

20

post-judgment motion by the Wyoming Stock Growers

21

Association for motion for a new trial or a motion to

22

alter or amend the judgment.

23

Association was concerned that the District Judge's

24

opinion did not address their claim to use of the

25

gravel.

The Wyoming Stock Growers

The government said, we are not deciding that

1

question in this case.

We don't contend that they're

2

not allowed to use it.

And the government and the Stock

3

Growers thereafter stipulated that the decision by the

4

District Court would have no res judicada effect on

5

claims by ranchers to use —
QUESTIONS

6

Was there a stipulation as to the

7

fact of whether or not there was commercial gravel

8

involved, commercially usable gravel?
ME. GARVEYs

9

No, there was not a stipulation,

10

although there was never an issue about that.

11

Bureau of Land Management took the position that it was

12

only salable gravel deposits that they were concerned

13

with.

14

market value in that market for the gravel was 30 cents

15

a cubic yard.

16

The

They appraised the land and decided that the fair

The Interior Board of Land Appeals, page 65A

17

— 65A of the government's appendix — Interior Board of

18

Land Appeals said that it is thus clear that gravel in a

19

valuable deposit is a mineral reserve to the United

20

States in patents issued under the Stock-Raising

21

Homestead Act, and went on to say that the respondent

22

had introduced no evidence which led it to question the

23

appraisal which had been made by the Bureau of Land

24

Management, and for that reason, because there was no

25

factual evidence to contradict the appraisal, would not

— would not give them a hearing.
Just one last point.

In the Court of Appeals,

3

the government’s brief, as the first issue presented,

4

said the issue is whether the District Court correctly

5

concluded that the Stock-Raising Homestead Act in its

6

legislative history show that Congress intended to

7

reserve all gravel deposits susceptible to commercial

8

exploitation on lands patented under the act.
