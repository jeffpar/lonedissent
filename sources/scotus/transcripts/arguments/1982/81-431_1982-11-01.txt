ORAL ARGUMENT QF CHRISTOPHER CROWLEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

MR. CROWLEYs

8

Hr. Chief Justice, may it please

9 the Courts
10

I'd like to reserve five minutes for rebuttal.

11

Our case presents the question of the proper

12 intepretat ion of

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and

13 more particularly the question of whether Congress meant
14 in 1964 to limit regulatory agencies to the use of a
15 clear intent standard or whether the Congress
16 contemplated the use of an impact approach, at least so
17 far as defining a prima facie case is concerned.
18

Our case was brought by black and Hispanic

19 policemen alleging that entry level examinations for the
20 New York City Police Department discriminated in their
21

effect on blacks and Hispanics and that they were not

22 job-related.

The case has had a long history, but the

23 relevant facts here are that the district court ruled
24 that the examinations did have a discriminatory impact
25 on blacks and Hispanics.

It also held that they were

not job-related.
The examinations have both a pass-fail

2

3 character -- one has to pass them

to become a policemen;

4

everyone in oar case iii pass and did become a policeman

5

-- but they are also used as the sole determinant of the

6 order in which people were appointed to the department,
7 which made a

15 district

On the job-relatedness question,

the

court stressed the fact that there had been no

17 testing for

19

being made as late as October

1974.

11

18

'68 to 1970 and

what it was that the exams were

and that therefore the exams couldn't be

validated.
It was important to make a finding as to Title

20

VI because some members of the class would not be

21

entitled to relief except under Title VI.

The district

22 court found that we had not shown a showing of intent
23 necessary to make out a
24

1981 violation.

P.s to Title VI, the district court placed

25 considerable reliance on the regulations which,

as the

some 52 federal agencies have adopted these same impact

25

regulations.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

The regulations provide in relevant part here

1

2

that they prohibit the use of "criteria or methods of

3

administration which have the effect of subjecting

4

persons to discrimination or which have the effect of

5

defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of

6

the objectives of the program."
In our brief we talk, about the language of the

7

3 statute and
9
10

the legislative history.

In my brief time

this morning I would like to stress the regulations and
their role here.
The one thing that we suggest that comes

11

12 across clearly,

the only thing that comes across very

13

clearly in the long debate about Title VI, is that there

14

was a very broad authorization by the Congress to the

15 federal regulatory agencies to draft regulations to
16

carry out the mandate of Title VI.

17 that they required
18

They’re unusual in

affirmative approval by the

President, but that was really in a sense an index of

19 how important they

were, how importantly they were

20 viewed by

the Congress at the time.

21

There was intense debate about the fact that

22 Title VI did not spell out in more detail just what was
23 meant
24

by discrimination and other violations of the

statute.

Senator Ervin says that Title VI leaves it to

25 the agencies to define discrimination

"without any

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

guideline whatever to point out what is the

2 Congressional intent.”
3

The House minority report says;

"The

4 Administration tends to rely on its own construction of
5 discrimination as including a lack of racial balance."
6 '

Senator Ervin, when questioning Attorney

7 General Robert Kennedy, says to you;

"So the rules,

8 which would have the force and effect of law, are to be
9 developed first in the minds of the administrators of
10 various programs, and then written in regulations and
11

orders issued by them?”

Attorney General Kennedy^

12 "That is correct. Senator."
13
14

The point is that there was a great focus on
the breadth of the authorization by the Congress to the

15 regulatory agencies.

We submit in the first instance

16 that the normal rule that contemporaneous regulations
17

adopted pursuant to a broad authorization like this are

18 entitled to great deference has particularly strong
19

application here, where there was such a strong focus on

20 just what those rules and regulations were going to say,
21

where it was a hot issue when it occurred, when there

22 was a debate as to what the scope of those regulations
t

23
24

could say.
It's also important, we think, to express the

25 fact that these impact regulations have been ratified by

7

your index, and I didn't find it on either of those two

5

pages.

I'll just put it that way.

6

NR. CROWLEY s

All right, sir.

7

As I say, the regulations were attacked in

8 1965 by Senator Ervin and others who had been concerned
9 about the scope of the authorization in

1964, and an

10

amendment was offered which would spell out a detailed

11

intent standard.

12

Kastenmeier, who had been strong proponents of Title VI

13

and had been involved in its passage, rose to its

14

defense and suggested, in the words of Congressman

15

Rodino, tha amendment "presents new criteria and

16

restricts the workings of Title VI.

17

be a complete repealer of Title VI."

18

Congressman Rodino and Congressman

It would in effect

Congressman Rodino said that it was his

19

"understanding" that the regulations were consistent

20

with the objectives of the title.

21

Kastenmeier said that it was his view that the amendment

22 would "gut Title VI of the

'64 law."

Would you paraphrase the

regulations that you're relying on?
NR. CROWLEY;

I can, sir.

(Pause.)

2

MR. CROWLEY;

3

QUESTION;

Just a second.

Well, if it takes -- I don't mean

4 to interrupt.
5

MR. CROWLEY;

6 prohibits --

I can quote.

The regulation

it prohibits the use of "criteria or

7 methods of administration which have the defect of
8 subjecting persons to discrimination" -- and if you look

9 at Appendix page 132, I hope that language is quoted
10 there -- "and also which have the effect of defeating or
11

substantially impairing the accomplishment of the

12 objectives of the program as with

respect to individuals

13 of a particular race, color or national origin."
14

QUESTION;

How would one interpret the phrase

15 "which have the effect of subjecting one to
16 discrimination"?
17

MR. CROWLEY;

Well, it is our view, of course,

18 that the appropriate thing — that that is a clear
19 indication that to look at effects is an appropriate
20 approach and
21

that to do what was done here, to look at

the discriminatory impact,

the fact that the whites and

22 Hispanics got in the top deciles at a much lower rate

23
24

QUESTION;

I don't see how the word "effect"

25 really helps you there.

If you say that if it has the

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

effect to subject one to discrimination, I don’t see

HR. CROWLEY*

8

I don't know that it spells it

Justice Rehnquist.

It just -- in our

disposition to look at the results as

to intentions, and suggests that a focus on an

impact approach is appropriate at least to make out a

9 prima facie

case here as under Title VII.

After the 1966 effort to amend the statute,

10
11

Congress on tan separate occasions passed fundina

12

statutes which contained clauses directly modeled on

13 Section

501.

Those statutes were in force pursuant to

14 impact regulations like the one

which I just quoted,

15 which is also relied upon in Lau v.
16 decision

below.
In six instances after this Court *s decision

17
18 in

Washington versus Davis, Congress reenacted or

19 amended

clauses modeled on Section 601 where impact

were in place.

We would suggest that these were not

They

They imposed a

affirmative obligation on the regulatory

25 agencies to monitor

programs, to respond to complaints.

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

They obliged recipients of federal funds to agree

2 contractually to be bound by the regulations.

There were references to, in the Congress in

3

4 the passage of later Acts, to the regulations.

In the

5 passage of -- in the Public Works Employment Act of
6 1966,

the statute itself says the discriminatory

7 provisions will be enforced through agency provisions
8 and rules similar to those already established under
9 Title VI.

When Senator Bayh was talking about Title IX,

10
11

sex discrimination, he saids

"The same procedure that

12 was set up and has operated with great success under the

13 1964 Civil Bights Act and the regulations thereunder
14 would be equally applicable to discrimination under
15 Title IX."
16

QUESTION;

Is there any other evidence of the

17 agencies' interpretation other than the regulation?
18

MR. CROWLEY;

I do not know of other evidence

19 in the record, Justice White.

I know of other evidence

20
21

QUESTION*

So — and Congress then -- as far

22 as ratification is concerned, you just rely on the fact

23 that Congress didn't disagree or perhaps approved of the
24 existing regulations?
25

MR. CROWLEY;

I would submit that Congress had

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to be iwars of the way in which the agencies were

2 conducting their compliance audits, which they would
3 report on to the Congress in the normal course.

QUESTION:

4
5

Well, that's what I just asked,

whether there --

6

MR. CROWLEY:

7

QUESTION:

8 regulations.

Yes, sir.

-- was any evidence other than the

Is there some evidence of enforcement

9 policies independent of the regulations?

MR. CROWLEY:

10
11

question.

I think I was answering your

12 used the impact regulations, the way they've gathered
13 data to conduct compliance audits,
14 known to the Congress.

would have to be

But there's no detail about that

15 in the record.

QUESTION:

16

Is there anything in the

17 legislative history?

You say there was ratification.

18 Is there any express language in

that legislative

19 history where Committees recognized or purported
20 recognize that an
21

to

impact standard was what was being

applied?

22

MR. CROWLEY:

23 language,

Justice White.

24

I was saying that, with respect to Title IX —

25 excuse me.

I am not aware of any express

Senator Bayh's comment suggests, in

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

sponsoring Title IX, the regulations have worked, there

2 has not been a flood of lawsuits, there has not been a

3 lot of cutoffs, because the statute and these
4 regulations have generally been obeyed.
5

As Justice Stevens said

in Fullilove, "Title

6 VI unequivocally and comprehensively prohibits

7 discrimination on the basis of race in any federally
8 sponsored program.

In view of the scarcity of litigated

9 claims, it's appropriate to assume that the law has
10
11

generally been obeyed."
Given an 18-year history of use of these

12 regulations,

the return back of the 1966 intent

13 amendment, the passage of new funding statutes, passage
14 of Title IX, Section 504, other funding statutes using
15 the very language of Section 501, all of which statutes
16 were regularly enforced with impact regulations, we
17 would suggest that there has been as a practical matter
18 developed a comprehensive federal legislative and
19 regulatory scheme using these impact regulations over
20 the years which

21

has worked well, and it should only be

disturbed if there's a clear indication that was a

22 contrary Congressional

23

intent back in 1964.

Re also think that it's appropriate to uphold

24 these regulations on the grounds that they're reasonably
25 related to the purposes of Title VI.

The standard was

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

set out by Justice Stewart concurring in Lau

Fe says;

2

"The critical question is whether the regulations and

3 guidelines by HEW go beyond the authority of Section
4 6 01."
5
6

Citing bourning, he states, "We held that the
validity of a regulation promulgated under a general

7 authorization provision," such as Section 602 of Title
8 VI,

"will be sustained so long as it's reasonably

9 related to the purposes of the enabling statute."
10

Horeover, he went on, "In assessing the purposes of

11

remedial legislation, we have found that departmental

12 regulations

and consistent administrative construction

13 are entitled to great weight."
14

We suggest that here these regulations are

15 more than reasonably related; they are essential to a
16 meaningful enforcement of Title VI.

The federal

17 agencies have to review thousands of programs, thousands
18 of complaints.

They have an obligation to conduct

19 compliance audits.
20
21

If they were obliged to use an intent standard
like that spelled out in Washington v. Davis, it would

22 be very difficult indeed, if not impossible.

Intent is

23 hard enough to unwind in the context of a regular court
24 case with simple issues.

It's harder still to probe

25 where you're trying to probe the intent of a school

If they had wanted to use_a clear intent

22 standard, there was language in Title VII dealing with

to make

that clear a distinction, they could have done so and

We also suggest that there should be a heavy

burden on those who say that Title VI and Title VII

should be interpreted fundamentally differently.

5

6

to municipalities, it would be anomalous, we suggest, to

7

have a fundamentally different standard for

You

10

you'd have a finding under Title VII that the City of

11

New York has discriminated in violation of Title VII,

12

but they could still receive funding under Title VI.
We think that, as I say, there’s a

13

14 considerable burden on

the people who suggest that

15 Congress intended in 1564 to have that kind of a
16

result.

HE. CROWLEY:

Indeed, sir.

The basic focus, of course, of our opponent’s

5

position and the view of the Court of Appeals was that

6

this situation is controlled by the Court's decision in

7

Bakke.

8

all, a terribly difficult case; and second, an utterly

9

-- a difficult case, and second, a very different case

We suggest basically that Bakke was, first of

10

from ours.

And we hope that the Court will be slow to

11

rely on broad language in our situation.
As Justice Brennan said at the outset of his

12

13 opinion,

"We agree with Mr. Justice Powell that, as

14 applied to the case before us, Title VI goes no
15 further," et cetera.
16

Bakke was not concerned with the guestion of

17 impact versus intent, as the United States in an amicus
18 brief was careful to spell out.

Eakke was not concerned

19 with what makes out a prima facie case of
20 discrimination.

21

You start out in Eakke with an admitted

intentional racial classification and the whole focus

22 was on justification of that.
23

Bakke was not concerned, as we are here, with

24 the validity of contemporaneous regulations adopted
25 pursuant to a broad

grant of Congressional authority.

Indeed, Justice Brennan in Bakke places considerable

he states, "These regulations, which under the terms of

MR. KOERNER;

21

Mr. Koerner.

Chief Judge and other honorable

At the outset we note that, while we did not

22 raise the issue of whether there's an implied right to

sue under Title VI because ve weren't aggrieved by the

24

lower court decision since we had won on that issue, it

25

is before this Court.

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

And we recognize that in Cannon this Court

2 indicated there probably is an implied

right, but it

3 took pains to distinguish mitle IX from Title VI on the
4

ground that at the time Title IX was enacted the

5

legislators assumed that there was a private right, and

6 not whether or not
7

in fact under Title VI there was.

We

will not discuss it in depth except to call to your

8 attention that particular issue.
9

What is conspicuous about the Petitioner’s

10

argument, both in the briefs and on oral presentation,

11

is the absence of any of the legislative history at the

12

time of the enactment in 1964.

13

some of the regulations after

14

it, but our position is that a regulation which makes

15

impermissible that which the legislative history intends

16

to be legal is a regulation that is illegal and has gone

too far and is not reasonably related.

Hubert Humphrey mentioned the different areas

The particular case which was

among the cases which motivated the Title VI legislation

which is cited in our

In Simkins, it was a challenge to the

The reason that the President was given this

and it was hoped that one agency wouldn’t cut

And indeed, it was contemplated by the

that what was a violation at one point may not be a

SR. K3ERNER:

But that title
The reference to the

5

remedy tha Attorney General can seek, under Title IV, and

6

in that respect he is limited to the extent that he

7 cannot seek

a remedy of busing and he cannot seek any

8 other remedy that'll go beyond the Constitution.
9

If it wasn’t for the purpose of limiting the

10

Attorney General’s jurisdiction, there would have been

11

no reference to the Constitution and the constitutional

12

standard would have been assumed.

13

In addition. Petitioner claims that you have

14 an anomaly in that municipal corporations were excluded
15 from Title VII and

that there is therefore a different

16 test, in that if they discriminate they are subject to a
17 less stringent standard under Title VI than Title VII.
18
19

That's specifically what Congress intended.
If indeed it was intended to have the same standard both

20 under Title VII and under Title VII,
21

there would have

been no reason to exclude governmental entities from

22 Title VII, and those entities were not included until
23
24

1972 after a great deal of debate.
In addition, with respect to municipal

25 corporations, they were immune from suit under

1983

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

under Monroe versus Pape, which was familiar to the

2 legislators in Congress at the time of enactment.

Can

3

it be said that it is likely that Congress, without

4

anything in the legislative history, would have made

5

municipalities subject to an impact standard with the

6

resultant potential loss of federal funding, after they

7

had been immune under 1983, without any comment to that

8

effect in the entire legislative history?

9

answer we believe is that it would be very unlikely.
The 1955 amendment which the Petitioners refer

10
11

And the

to was an amendment that contained many different

12 pieces, one

of which was to establish an intent

13

standard.

But the proponent of that amendment, Emanuel

14

Celler, indicated that he was putting it in only to

15 clarify what he
16

constitutional standard.
More importantly, there were other factors

17

18 within that
19

believed was already there, a

amendment.

That amendment contained

different procedures for Title VI.

It allowed an entity

20 receiving federal funds to waive the receipt to be
21

beyond the jurisdiction of the agencies enforcing Title

22 VI.
23
24
25

And finally, it restricted the ability of the

agencies, even where there was a violation.
So when that amendment failed passage both in
the House and the Senate, the reason for its failure was

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

unclear.

And as this Court has remarked many times, any

2

reason to attribute to its failure would be sheer

3

speculation.
Again, the only thing that supports the

4
5

Petitioners’

position are the regulations that were

6

passed subsequent to 1354.

7

whether those regulations were enforced.

Indeed, there is doubt as to
The only case

8 commenting on the regulations was Brown against
9
10

Weinberger and the comment generally was that the
agencies hadn’t enforced it.
And if you review the cases we set forth in

11
12

our brief after *54 and before this Court’s decision in

13

Lau against Nichols, you will see consistently that the

14

courts applied an intent standard and therefore they did

15

not believe the regulations could change the law.

16

indicated in the outset of our argument —

But it didn’t come out of —
No, no.

The only reference they

24

used was constitutional standard, and they were prepared

25

to incorporate the standard whether it included intent

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

or effect.

They didn't define it in such manner.
In sum, what we are saying is that the

2
3

language and the history was olear and articulate, that

4

the state of mind of the legislators at that time was

5

only to redress the obvious wrongs created by

6

intentional segregation.
QUESTION

7
8

9

There was no --

Even though they didn't use

"intent"?
i!R . KOERNERi

That's right.

There was no

10

refinement with respect to intent versus impact.

11

impact refinement was a judicial gloss put on by this

12 Court in Griggs against Duke Power solely with

The

respect

3

to one portion of Title VII with regard to testing,

4

where the language indicated that it would be illegal to

5 use a competency

exam unless you can show that the exam

6

wasn't being "used to discriminate."

7

was defined to create an impact standard.

8
9

It's also interesting to note that the rest of
Title VII has been construed to have an intent standard

20 with respect

21

The term "used"

to disparate impact.

So we're talking

about the comparison of one isolated section of Title

22 VII, which doesn't result in the calamitous loss of
23 federal funding,

with the entire Title VI jurisdiction

24

with the administrative procedure which contemplates

25

both voluntary compliance and a cutback, if that doesn't

work, of federal funding.
We believe this Court's decision in Bakke is

3

clear and its intimation in Board of Education versus

4

Harris that indicated that Bakke had so held the

5

constitutional standard is correct.

And we ask that

6 that portion of the circuit court's opinion which has
7

upheld the intent standard for Title VI be affirmed.

I’d just like to add briefly,

Mr. Chief Justice, that where there has been no

where the debates are necessarily unclear, that whether

you assume a constitutional standard or not, that there

of the use and ratification of regulations like these,

19

which were in our view impliedly endorsed by the

from 1983.
