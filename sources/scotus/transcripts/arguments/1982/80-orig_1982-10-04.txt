ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. SIMMS, Esq.

ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANTS
MR. SIMMS*

the Court*
The Special Master's report in this case was

10

11

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

filed in January of this year, and since then it has not

12 gone unnoticed.

I think the Court should know that the

13 Community of Western Water Attorneys, as well as water
14 administrators in the West, are bewildered by the
15 Master's recommendations and are apprehensive about the
16 outcome of this case.
17

I would like to quote briefly from the —

18

QUESTION*

The important thing, Mr. Simms, of

19 course, is whether we understand it, isn't it?
MR. SIMMS*

thing.

I agree, that is the important

But I think it's also important that the Court

22 understands what people in the West feel about the case.

23

I'd like to quote briefly from the Western

24 Natural Resource Litigation Digest, the quarterly
25 publication of the Western Conference of Attorneys

General

2

In January 1982/ the court's special master

3 recommendei that Colorado Fuel and Iron Steel
4

Corporation be given first priority on the Vermejo River

5 in an action brought by the State of Colorado for the

6 apportionment of the river between the states of
7 Colorado and
8

New Mexico.

For the past 100 years, the

river has been fully appropriated in New Mexico.

9

The decision ignored both New Mexico's

10 historical dependence on the Varmejo and their
11

traditional guiding principle that prior appropriation

12 governs.

The Special Master's new test balances the

13 economic efficiency

of existing uses against the

14 efficiency of proposed uses.

In this case, the test is used in a further

15

16 departure from previous case law
17 such

to vary the priorities

that existing economies based upon senior uses are

18 undermined.

issues of the case.

MR. SIMMS:

Suppose we get on to the central

15

apportionment.

16

this case and attributed legal significance to

18

finding that CF&I's proposed diversion would have little

19

effect on New Mexico users, I believe that is not a

20

finding at all but is demonstrably an erroneous

21

conclusion of law.

22

I think the Special Master

I think he ignored the relevant facts in

And with respect to his ultimate

I think the real irony of the Master’s report

23

lies in his understanding that — and I'm quoting him

24

from page 21 of the report — the unique circumstances

25

which confronts the Master in this case is Colorado’s

1

failure to divert water and put it to beneficial use at

2 any time in the past.

New Mexico has applied the water

3 and has existing economies which are dependent upon that
4 water.
5

Instead of applying, the rather obvious

6 holdings of this Court in Wyoming versus Colorado and

7 Nebraska versus Wyoming and in Arizona versus
8 California,

the Master instead has equated the cause of

9 action in this case with the relief sought.
10 puts it is this, and
11

The way he

I'll quote him again -- simply

stated, the doctrine says that each state is equal to

12 all of the others,

and as quasi-sovereigns, each state

13 is entitled to a share of a river flowing between them.

14

Wa think that the Master started with the view

15 that each state is entitled to a portion of the waters
16 of an interstate stream no matter what the circumstances
17 might be.

This is best illustrated I think by the

18 Master's treatment of the first equitable apportionment
19 decision handed down by this Court in 1906, Kansas
20 versus Colorado.
21

That case, very unlike th*e case before this

22 Court today, showed — the facts in that case showed a
23 pattern of contemporaneous development in both states.
24 By 1883 in Kansas, there were some 1,200,000 acres of
25 irrigation on the Arkansas in Kansas.

Between 1884 and

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

1891, there had developed independently under the law or

2 prior appropriation in Colorado some 300,100 acres of
3
4
5

land .
That situation presented the classic equitable
apportionment case.

The water supply became

6 insufficient to satisfy the simultaneous growth in both
7

states, and there appeared a conflict in the social and

8 economic institutions which had developed independently.
9

There, the substantive laws of each state —

10

and as you’ll recall, it was said in Kansas versus

11

Colorado that there is no federal law of water in the

12

West; each state has a right to develop its own system

13

under which rights to the use of water might be

14

protected — each state had done so.

15

laws in Kansas versus Colorado had been exercised

16

historically.

17

between existing users on either side of the state line.

18
19

The substantive

In that case there was an actual conflict

Because in Kansas they have the doctrine of
riparianism, which stands for the proposition that water

20 should be maintained in the river and let down the river
21

undiminished, and on Colorado's side you have priority

22 of appropriation, a doctrine which allows water to be
23

diverted from the river and taken to lands not riparian

24

to the river, you had an actual collision of sovereigns

25

in that case.

Also, the sovereign interest on both

1

sides of the Kansas-Colorado border arose from actual

2 existing uses of water in the respective states.
3

Notwithstanding those obvious differences from

4

this case, the Master has said, and I'm quoting, The

5

same type of situation exists in this case.

7

Mr. Simms, may I ask you whether

it's your position that as between two states, both of

8 which are states using the appropriated water theory,
9

that the prior appropriator must make reasonable use of

10

the water that's appropriated?

11

12

measure of reasonable use, in your view?

Do we measure the

is obligated to conserve water to the extent that is

economically possible.

16

case and no discussion in the Special Master's report,

17

as opposed to Colorado's reply brief, that there were

18

any uses in New Mexico that ware not responsible uses of

19

water.

20
21

There is no evidence in this

The measure of water, I think, is one that the
Master did not follow, and I think it's one of his

22 fundamental mistakes.

What the Master should have done

23

in assessing the water right entitlements in New Mexico

24

so that he could further assess injury was to look to

25

the actual historic irrigated acreage on the river.
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

That is not necessarily the decreed right.

It

2 is something that can be discovered through a look at

3 what's been irrigated historically.
4

QUESTIONS

Instead of —

If the historic use is somehow

5 wasteful, can the Master take that into consideration or
6 not?

7

MR. SIMMS*

Oh, I think he definitely can.

And

8 I would point out that there is nothing in the record in

9 this case that indicates that there is any waste.
10

You'll find a lengthy, uninhibited discussion of that in

11

Colorado's brief.

12

the Special Master’s report.

13

You will find no discussion of it in

I think it's important also in that regard to

14 make a distinction early on.

And the term inefficiency

15 and the term waste are used. Justice O'Connor,
16 throughout the briefs in this case, and they're
17 important to the case.
18

But the Court should know that efficiency is a

19 term of art in irrigation in the West.
20 inefficiency in the pejorative sense.
21

It's not
Efficiency in

irrigation is a term used to describe the amount of

22 water diverted which is not consumed.

23

Typically, in a farming operation a farmer

24 might divert 100-acre feet of water.

In the actual

25 growth of plants, in evapo-transpiration, perhaps 50

percent of that would be utilized.

2 to the regimen of the stream.

3 percent efficient.

The rest goes back

That use is called 50

The inefficiency results from a

4 bunch of physical factors.

Those physical factors are a

5 function of the porosity of soils, they're a function of
6 local temperature, winds,

evaporation rates and other

7 physical factors.
8

QUESTION:

Would there be any support in the

9 case law, counsel, for requiring, for example, the
10 appropriation user to line ditches with concrete, or

11

anything of that sort?

12

KR. SIMMS:

No, on the contrary. Justice

13 O'Connor, the cases, and specifically, Nebraska versus
14 Wyoming, indicate that farmers are obliged to be only as
15 efficient as they economically can be efficient.

There

16 is not one iota of evidence in this case that indicates
17 that New Mexico's farmers could have been more efficient
18 historically than they have been.
They don't have the money in the Vermejo

19

20 Conservancy District,
21

as an example, to go buy extremely

expensive sprinkler irrigation systems and thus improve

22 the irrigation efficiency by 10 to 20 pecent.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Simms, the Master did find that

24 the operation of that district was inefficient, didn't
25 he?
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MS. SIMMS:

He did find -- I don’t think he

2 found — yss, he did find that it was inefficient.

3

QUESTION;

And he also found, as I recall, that

4 there was a loss of about 33 percent of the water.

And

5 by loss there, did he mean the water was going back into
6

the river or that it just was not used anywhere?

7

MR. SIMMS:

What the Master found was that 33

8 percent of the water diverted was lost in the

9 application of water in the Vermejo Conservancy
10 District.
11

As a matter of fact, I think the Master had

the numbers backwards.

Actually, 67 percent of the

12 water diverted is lost.

13

The efficiency of the Vermejo Conservancy

14 District, as an example, is roughly in the middle of the
15 efficiency of Western reclamation projects.
16 efficiency is 54 percent.

That

There is absolutely nothing

17 uncommon about that.
If you add to it the evaporation from the

18

19 various reservoirs, the efficiency drops down to 33
20 percent.
21

either.

He had it backwards.

That is not an uncommon

In calculating efficiency, you don’t add in the

22 reservoirs.

That’s not the way the Bureau of

23 Reclamation would do it in calculating efficiency.
24

The Master has done it quite differently.

So

25 even though he found inefficiency, first of all, he had
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the concept of efficiency conceptually backwards; and

2 secondly, it’s a non sequitur.

It means nothing.

If

3 the efficiency of the Vermejo Conservancy District —

Which case, if I may interrupt you,

versus Kansas, Nebraska versus Wyomind.

9
10

Wyoming versus Colorado, Colorado

QUESTION!

Which supports you?

Which of those,

you think?

11

12 us.

MR. SIMMS!

All three of those cases support

In each of those cases, — well, in two of them,

13 particularly, Colorado made the argument that they could
14 take water and use it better elsewhere.

In Wyoming

15 versus Colorado, as an example, Colorado argued that we
16 can take water, use it in the Puter Valley much better
17 than Wyoming can use it in the Laramie Valley.

The

18 court rejected that argument just out of hand.

You’ll

19 find that language in the decision.
20

Yes, Justice Rehnquist?

21

QUESTION!

Am I correct in thinking that, if I

22 read page 21 of the Master's report correctly, that he

23 said there that if you apply the rule of prior
24 appropriation in this case, it would prevent any
25 diversion to Colorado.

So that, in effect, the Master
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

has said as between two statas, both of which apply

2 appropriative water law, you do not apply prior
3

appropriation law in the interstate stream adjudication

4

if it results in one state not getting any water.

5

the question really is whether the court's prior cases

And

6 support that departure from appropriation law in the
7

case of two states which follow that principle.
MR. SIMMS*

8
9

And the answer to that question is somewhat lengthy.
The principles set down by this Court in every

10

equitable apportionment decision that's been handed down

11

before would lead you to precisely the opposite result

12
?

I think not at all, in response.

.

13

that the Master has reached.

His treatment of priority

14

of appropriation I think totally misses the thrust of

15

this Court's decisions.
Priority of appropriation has been adopted by

16
17

each of the 11 contiguous western states, the semi-arid

18

and arid western states that are west of the 100th

19

Meridian.

The jurisprudential underpinning of that

20 doctrine is there simply is not enough water to go
21

around to satisfy the conflicting demands.

That's the

22 basis of the doctrine.
23

The reason for priority of appropriation lies

24

in the fact that recognition of the benefit or the

25

equitable interest that arises out of the application to
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

beneficial use of water is synonymous with the uses that

2 are actually made.
3

Priority of appropriation is so fundamental,

4 it’s been enshrined in the constitutions of almost all
5 of the western states including Colorado and New
6 Mexico.

Without it in the West there would have been

7 chaos and would today be chaos in water administration.
8

QUESTIONS

9 appropriation?

Mr. Simms, what's your benchmark for

Is it the water that's actually been

10 used historically, or is it just decreed rights?
11

MR. SIMMS*

It is not necessarily decreed

12 rights.

You have to look at the —

13

QUESTION*

Well, what about this case?

Let's

14 just suppose that the average annual use was X and that
15 there was more water in the river than that.

But the

16 decreed rights were XX, and with XX there wouldn't be
17 any water left.

Now, would — under equitable

18 apportionment, would Colorado in this case, for example,
19 be entitled to some water if there was more water in the
20 river than necessary to satisfy average annual use?
21

MR. SIMMS*

If there were enough water in the

22 river to satisfy the average annual use — if you want
23 to put it that way.

I would call it the average

24 historic use -- there would be — Colorado would have a
25 right, in my view, to some water.
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

I think not in these circumstances for other

2 reasons.

Colorado has sat by for 115 years while this

3

river became fully appropriated.

4

acquiesced in the total use of the river by New Mexico.
QUESTION;

5

Colorado has

6 of the record was that there was water left over in the

river after satisfying the average historic use, as you

1

MR. SIMMSi

The decreed rights is an example

2 for the Vermejo Conservancy District.

There are some

3

14,000 acres of decreed right.

4

Court would recognize their ability to irrigate what the

5

Bureau of Reclamation rehabilitated, minus what might be

We only hope that the

6 expected to be fallow, about 10 percent.
7

8

The total

irrigable acreate is 7380 acres.
What the Master did here was take Colorado’s

9

figures, which relate to a period of drought in the late

10

seventies, and reduced the entitlement to what was there

11

in that drought.

12

QUESTION:

Do we have to decide this case

13

properly — do we have to decide whether the Master was

14

incorrect in doing that?

15
16

MR. SIMMS:

understand that the Master was incorrect in doing that.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SIMMS:

19

20
21

22

I think it’s important that you do

Is that a factfinding?
I think it is a factfinding, but it

is spoiled by two problems —
QUESTION:

So we have to overturn the Master in

this respect to come out on your side?
MR. SIMMS:

In that respect, but not to come

23

out on our side in general, no.

Because the basic

24

problem that the Master did was to look at what he

25

called the economy of the Vermejo Conservancy District,
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and he didn’t make a finding there with respect to New

2 Mexico’s entitlement.

He just looked at that district

3

and concluded that the district was economic and that he

4

could ignore that entire district in assessing injury.

5

Hhat he put the most weight on when he did that

6 was the fact that in 1980 Congress deferred payment for
7

the construction costs of that district after a

8 congressional finding that the drought in the late
9

seventies had made it impossible for the farmers in the

10

district to pay back construction costs.

11

nothing unusual about that.

12

knows that.

13

There is

I don’t think the Master
t

Historically, Congress has deferred payment for

14

each and every reclamation project in the United States

15

at one time or another.

16

for good reason, whenever something like a drought

17

prevents the repayment of construction costs.

19

Here, the Vermejo Conservancy District farmers
have made their construction costs, or did make them,

Congress continues to do it,

1974.

They made a partial

They have always made the 0£M costs.

The other failure of the Master is he

23

identified profitability of the Vermejo Conservancy

24

District with the economy as that term has been utilized

25

by this Court in previous equitable apportionment

actions.

And what he did, for instance, was look to

2 evidence that we presented

which indicated in 1979 there

3

was a net operating loss of $39,000 among the district's

4

63 farms.

5

this economy is no good; therefore, it can't be injured.

6
7

He took evidence like that and thought well,

What ha fails to do is recognize that despite
the fact that there was a $39,000 net operating loss,

8 there were still paid in 1979 one million dollars in
9

local and state taxes by those people; there were also

10

mortgage payments being made, there were also farm

11

implements still being bought, there were payments being

12

made to local banks.

13

children that go to school that have medical bills, they

14

buy shoes, they have to eat.

15

there, notwithstanding the fact that there was a net

16

operating loss in that year of $39,000.

17

The families that live there have

The economy is still

I think the Master has a totally misconceived

18

— and this is legal; it is not factual, and it so

19

infects his finding. Justice White, that I think that it

20 is rather easy for the Court to conclude that he was

wrong with respect to the Vermejo Conservancy District.
He did something differently with respect to

23

all of the other users in New Mexico.

Colorado designed

24

this case, first of all, to try to eliminate and pare

25

down the water rights in New Mexico on the one hand and

than inflate tha amount of water in the river on the

2 other.

3

What they did was try to limit the amount of

4 acreage to the acreage irrigated in the late seventies.
5 Therefore, it would appear that there might be some
6 water made available for CFSI.

Colorado took the figure

7 250 acres, for example, to the Vermejo Park Corporation,
8 the first diverter in New Mexico.

9 irrigated in the late seventies.

That's what was
Well, in 1978, as an

10

example, in the Vermejo Conservancy District, they had

11

no water to put on their lands because of the drought.

12

The uncontradicted evidence in the case shows

13 that the actual historic irrigated acreage — this is
14 not the decreed acreage. Justice O'Connor — the
15 historic irrigated acreage of Vermejo Park Corporation
16 was 690 acres.

That is not contradicted.

That acreage was irrigated before 1963.

17

18 what the Master should have looked at.

That's

Under the

19 Constitution and laws of both states, you can't blame
20 the farmer for drought conditions.
21

His property right

doesn't dissipate just because it didn't rain for a few

22 years.

That's what the Master has done here.

Because

23 it didn't rain, ha has just killed off the users in New
24 Mexico.
25

Secondly, Colorado tried to throw out the whole
19

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

bottom half of tha river, the Canadian.

And what he has

2 done — Colorado has tried to make it appear as if this
3

were a closed basin somehow, and that water does not get

4 on down to the Canadian River users.

Well, one of the glaring contradictions in

5

6 Colorado's case here is when they went to Water Division
7 2,

when CF£I went to Water Division 2 in 1975 to get

8 their inchoate water right in Colorado — this is 100
9 years after the river was fully appropriated downstream

10 — they were thrown out of court initially because the
11

jurisdictional embrace of the court in Colorado goes to

12 the Arkansas River drainage.

The judge sat in Alamosa,

13 he looked to the East and saw the Arkansas,

he looked to

14 the South and saw the Vermejo and said, I don't have
15 jurisdiction,

that doesn't drain into the Arkansas.

Well, CF&I went back to court and vehemently

16

17 petitioned the court, oh, yes,

you do have jurisdiction

18 because the Vermejo comes down here, it's tributary to
19 the Canadian here,

the Canadian turns east and flows on

20 into Oklahoma, and over there it is tributary to the
21
22

Arkansas.
Well, that's how they got in court to get their

23 water right.

Now they turn around when they get into

24 this Court and say the river stops when you get down to
25 the Vermejo Conservancy District.

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

I think the eviience that impressed the Master

1

2

in that regard was not the testimony of the farmers

3 downstream that indicated that they rely on that water.
4 It’s not the legal fact that they have a property right
5 in Vermejo water.

It was the fact that in a certain

6 20-year period of record, only 6900 acre feet got past

7 the Vermejo Conservancy District's point of diversion.
Well, if you look at the 30-year period of

8

9 records just prior to that, you'll find out that an
10 average annual of 7,100 acre feet got down.
11

I don't

think it really makes any difference what the amount is.
QUESTION:

12

When you talk about the water

13 getting down past the Vermejo diversion point, that's
14 because of what you referred to as inefficiency?
15

MB. SIMMS:

16

QUESTION:

No, it is not inefficiency at all.
What is it?

I mean, if the stream

17 were entirely appropriated, one would expect, I would

1

know you have the briefs and a description of the river

2 system, for me to give you a very brief survey of what
3 the situation is.
4

The first diversion across the state line from

5 Colorado into New Mexico is the Vermejo Park Corporation
6 which diverts enough water to irrigate 250 acres.

It

7 has a decreed right for 870 acres but hasn't been using
8 that.

The state engineer of New Mexico, Mr. Reynolds,

9 the chief water official of that state, testified that
10 that organization could, in fact, use more water than it
11 had been using.

This relates to the question of the

12 difference between decreed usage and actual usage.
13

The next user down the stream is the Kaiser

14 Steel Corporation.

The maximum amount they’ve used is

15 361 acre feet; that was in 1976.

Since then, they have

16 used less than that.
17

Going on down, there’s the Phelps Dodge

18 Corporation which has decreed rights for 500 acres, or
19 1000 acre feet.
20 acre.

The allocation is two acre feet per

But Phelps Dodge, through a lessee, is irrigating

21 only 150 acres.

Again, New Mexico officials testified

22 that they could use more water than they have been using.
23

There’s been reference to a drought in the

24 seventies.

The figures really belie that.

The Vermejo

25 Conservancy District in the seventies irrigated 4,100
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and some acres; in the sixties irrigated 4,500 and some

2 acres.

The measured flow at the Dawson Gauge, which is

3 the only measuring gauge on the river, was some 8000 in
4 the seventies, some 11,000 in the sixties, some 9000 in
5 the fifties.
Now, this doesn't indicate a severe drought

6

7 which caused this unreal situation that New Mexico
8

suggests.

9

Going down then, below the Phelps Dodge usage

10

is the Vermejo Conservancy District diversion point.

11

that point, they have a canal that's capable of carrying

12 600

cubic feet per second.

At

Between that point and the

13 district reservoirs, there are individual diverters that
14 in recent years have been taking out approximately 500
15 to 600 acre feet of water.

So that you have no more

16 than 1500 acre feet of actual usage between the state
17 line and the district reservoirs.
18

Between that diversion point of the district

19 and the district reservoirs, according to the New Mexico
20 chief witness, there's a
21

10 percent loss of water.

In

the reservoirs themselves by evaporation, there's a 2300

22 acre foot loss of water which amounts to something

23 between 20 and 25 percent.

So you have about a

24 one-third loss of water between the district diversion
25 point, and the point of outflow from the reservoirs.
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Then from the reservoirs to the fields, again

1

2 according to the testimony of New Mexico witnesses,

3 there's another 33 percent loss, and that's what the
4 Special Master was referring to, and he was entirely
5 correct.

He didn't have his figures mixed.
QUESTION*

6

7 referring to?

How do you know what he was

He didn't make these kind of detailed

8 findings about the water loss.

9

MR. WELBDRN:

Justice White, in his report he

10

said that the system of canals used to transport the

11

water to the fields is inefficient.

12

QUESTION*

On what page are you?

13

MR. WELBORNs

I'm at page 8 of his report.

14 Now, the only reference in the New Mexico testimony to a
15 system of canals — and in fact, the only system of
16 canals — is the system from the reservoirs to the
17 fields.

So that is exactly what the Special Master was

18 referring to.
In order to argue their point. New Mexico

19

20 changes the subject of that sentence and says in their
21

brief that the Special Master found that the district

22 was so inefficient that it lost 33 percent of the

23 water.

They make the subject of that sentence rather

24 than the system of canals.

And it's really a point that

25 shouldn't be involved in this case, because the facts
28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

are so clear and New Mexico acknowledges that Colorado's

2 Exhibit 71 is accurate in this regard; that there is a

3 two-thirds loss of water from the district diversion
4 point to the fields.
5

QUESTION*

6

MR. WELBORN*

So what if there is, Mr. Welborn?
Well, this. Justice White, gets

7 to my first and my third point, which is really the
8 basic point

here, and that has to do with the

9 elimination of waste by the district that will offset
10

11
12

the Colorado allocation.
New Mexico’s Exhibit E3, which is perhaps the
most important exhibit in the case, is a detailed

13 engineering report as to the manner in which the
14 district supplies stock water, water to the livestock of
15 the district.

And this livestock system is simply an

16 open ditch system whereby the water is released from the
17 reservoirs and taken to the fields.
18

The livestock consume approximately 35 acre

19 feet of water, but in order to get this 35 acre feet of
20 water to the livestock there must be released from the
21

reservoirs over 2000 acre feet.

So you can see there's

22 about a 90 percent loss there.

23

Now, the Exhibit E3 demonstrates that by a

24 closed system which can be financed to a large extent by
25 soil conservation assistance, Farm Home Administration
29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

assistance, that by a closed system this 2000 acre feet

2 loss can be eliminated.

And not only will it be

3 eliminated, but the district will benefit because they
4 will get a domestic system as well as a stock water
5 system, and the stock water will be available 12 months
6 out of the year instead of

7 as it is now.
8

9 1/2 months out of the year,

The other two and a half months they have

to haul the stock water.

The reason for that is it's in

9 the winter months when the ditches are frozen.
10

Now, if this --

11

QUESTION;

Mr. Walborn, do our cases require a

12 state to — or a prior appropriator —

to make that kind

13 of structural change to utilize the water more
14 efficiently?

Is there authority in the case law for

15 making that kind of determination?
16

MR. WELB0RN:

Yes, there is. Justice O'Connor.

17 In three cases, this Court talks about wasteful uses,
18 and I am not suggesting that this Court can tell a state
19 or anyone in a state in detail what it has to do.
20 the guiding principle here is equity.
21

equitable considerations.

But

What are the

And Colorado versus Kansas

22 says that all factors bearing on the equities must be

23 considered as of the time of the controversy.
24

How, in Nebraska, —

QUESTION*

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

response to Justice O'Connor,- but let me just throw in

2

this question and answer it when you can, if you wish.

3
4

I understood the Waster to take the rather flat
position at page 21 of his report, he says right at the

5 end of the quote,
6

at the top, "If the rule of priority

were to be strictly applied in Colorado versus New

7 Mexico...",

this case, "...a diversion of water by

8 Colorado could not occur.
9 facts other than

priority must be applied to achieve

10 equity in these cases
11

involving an interstate river."

Now, I regard that last statement of the Master

12 as somewhat dubious in the
13

As the court has held before,

light of our prior cases.

I

think he departed rather substantially here from the

14 prior appropriation law that would have been applied
15 either in Colorado or in New Mexico.

And I would be

16 interested in hearing your explanation of why our prior
17 cases authorize

questions at the same time.

20 versus Wyoming,

21

this sort of departure.

Nebraska

which is essentially the last case,

although Arizona versus California is still pending, did

22 say that priority of appropriation may be a main
23 consideration, but it listed a number of other factors.
24 And one of those other factors is wasteful uses.
25

Wyoming versus Colorado, which seems to

3

QUESTION*

But don't most state systems that

4

follow the appropriation system themselves allow for

5

discounting of wasteful uses?
MR. WELBORN:

6
7

They do not — it's a matter of

degree, of course. Justice Rehnquist.

In Colorado, for

8 example, the definition of beneficial use in its
9

statutes is the use of that amount of water to

10

accomplish, without waste, the purpose for which the

11

appropriation is intended.

12

the water officials to shut down diversions if waste is

13

occurring.

And Colorado statutes direct

Now, this brings up a basic consideration here,

and that is that although two states may follow the

16

priority of appropriation doctrine, this does not mean

17

by any stretch that they have the same water line.

MR. WELBORN:

Excuse me, on the Vermejo.

They

2 do not, as Colorado does, declare forfeitures or
3

abandonments of water rights when water rights have not

4

been used or portions of water rights have not been used

5

for a number of years.

6

laws and procedures allow the proliferation of stock

7

ponds along the tributaries of the Vermejo which are

They allow — the New Mexico

8 referred to time and again in the Bureau of Reclamation
9

documents, and these are Exhibits 37 to 48 in the

10

record.

These documents say that these proliferations

11

of stock ponds along the Vermejo are the major cause of

12

the water condition.

13

Colorado does not permit that.

14

of that nature — these are ponds constructed on

15

tributaries of the river to provide water for livestock

16

— if stock ponds of that nature are constructed and

17

they are causing injury, then something can be done

18

about it.

19

If stock ponds

The New Mexico law does not provide for that.
The point is that priority of appropriation —

20 and this is a perfect example of why it cannot control,
21

because it is only one consideration.

That’s what

22 Nebraska versus Wyoming said, that’s what Wyoming versus
23

Colorado in effect said, and New Mexico argues that

24

point very strenuously in its brief in the Arizona

25

versus California case, which is in the file, in the
33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

record in this case.

2

QUESTIONS

May I ask this question.

Are you

3 saying that if there was no evidence of waste, no
4 evidence that New Mexico was not exercising appropriate
5 oversight over the use of water, and assuming that
6 Colorado never used any at all, that the doctrine of
7 equitable apportionment would entitle Colorado to some,
8 anyway?
9

ME. WELBORNs

I'm saying that the decisions

10 have said that, Your Honor.
11

QUESTIONS

I think the Master in this case also

12 said it, didn't he?
13

f

MR. WELBORNs

The decisions have said that.

14 The Master in this case, incidentally, was very familiar
15 with Wyoming versus Colorado because he was attorney
16 general to Wyoming during one phase of that.

And he was

17 very impressed with certain similarities there.
18

Now, as New Mexico argues in its brief in the

19 Arizona versus California case, it might seem at first
20 blush that Wyoming versus Colorado calls for the
21 straight application of priority of appropriation.

But

22 it does not, because in that case, as in this case
23 before the Court, a specific amount of water was
24 allocated to Colorado which it would take regardless of
25 priority.
34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

And starting with the first case# Kansas versus

2 Colorado, this Court said the states come here on the
3

basis of equality of right.

4

there shall be an equal division.

5

Connecticut versus Massachusetts goes on to say that

6

this is an entirely different situation than that which

7

obtains in private controversies between parties where

8

priority is the straight rule.

It said this doesn't mean
But it says — and

And the cases again and again emphasize, as

9
10

Nebraska versus Wyoming quotes again from Colorado

11

versus Kansas, it says, all factors, all factors,

12

bearing on the equities must be considered.
QUESTION'S

13

So that, if I understand your

14

correctly, if a state, with respect to an interstate

15

river, had never used any water before and the other

16

state was making 100 percent use of it, the state that

17

had never used any water still would be entitled to some.
MR. WELBORN:

18
19

I’m suggesting that that would be

a matter for the Court to consider in its balancing of

20 equities; that the door is not closed for the new use.
21

There are three cases of this Court involving new uses.

22 Connecticut versus Massachusetts, New Jersey versus New
23

2

The first two. Justice Rehnquist,

3

were riparian states, but there's a great similarity.

4

In New Jersey versus New York, for example, New Jersey

5

came in and said that they were entitled to have the

6 stream flow in its more or less original condition by
7

reason of their riparian rights.

Now, that’s exactly

8 what New Mexico is contending here; that by virtue of
9
10

these decreed priority rights, it’s entitled to have the
river flow in its original condition.
And the court in New Jersey versus New York

11

12

said that the thing to do in these cases is to achieve

13

equitable apportionment — and these are the very words

14

— to achieve equitable apportionment without quibbling

15

over formulas.

This is an original proceeding in

Priority is a rule of law; statutory law within

22 the states.

It would be grossly inequitable to apply it

MR. WELBORN*

That, as I say, geographically,

22 that wouldn't happen because of the diversion points,

25 the Colorado decree or points above those that are named.

Well, I would think Colorado, under

2 this allocation, could take up to 4,000 acre feet out of

3 those particular streams.
4

MR. WELB0RN*

Well, as I say, if the diversion

5 is limited to those diversion points, there would be a

built-in safety factor, but this gets back. Justice

7 White, to the basic point.
8

QUESTION*

Well, I don't understand that.

9

MR. WELB0RN*

That the states stand in these

10 proceedings on the basis of

equality of right, and as

New Mexico has said in each brief, in the Arizona versus

No.

That is one method to

4 is New Mexico’s exhibit that went into the record.
5

Additionally, there is a tremendous amount of

6

waste through these stock farms that I mentioned, that

7 are mentioned again and again in the —
8

QUESTION;

But the point is, for you to say New

9 Mexico wouldn’t be hurt, you are assuming New Mexico
10 will apply some conservation measures that have not

12

historically been applied.
MR. WELBORNs

That is quite correct. Justice

13 O’Connor, and I think that bears on the equity.

I don’t

14 think that it’s — that Colorado has to be asked to
15 forego a proper amount of water from this river to
16 subsidize uses in New Mexico that are not reasonably
17 efficient.

QUESTIONS

But to what extent do you think

19 coarts have a right to get in in these disputes and
20 weigh the extent to which ditches should be lined, or

21

pipelines installed, or new storage facilities built,

22 and so on?

23

MR. WELBORNs

I think, Justice O'Connor, this

24 Court has gotten into those things in some detail.

In

25 Washington versus Oregon, for example, the Court was

44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 ready to conclude that Oregon diversions should not be
2 curtailed, and the Court said to itself, as stated in
3 the opinion, well, first we've got to look to see
4 whether these Oregon uses are wasteful or not.
5

The Court then went on — there was a question

6 in that case about a water right in Washington, and the
7 Court went on to declare that that water right for the
8 purpose of the case was to be considered abandoned,

so

9 the Court has gotten into these internal factors.
10

In Nebraska versus Wyoming, this Court said

11 that for the purpose of that case, the Court could look
12 at the priorities within a particular state.
13 done, I suggest, in reverse.

It is

The Court says that if you

14 want the equity of this Court — it says this to a state
15 — you have got to come in with reasonably efficient
16 uses.

If you want the equity of this Court to say this

17 other state and the needed uses in that state, and here
18 the Colorado uses — this is not just CF6I, the state
19 engineer of Colorado testified as to the — and set
20 forth in his Exhibit 14 the great need of Colorado for
21 this water.
22

This water will come into Colorado and be used

23 and reused in the Purgatory Valley.

In that valley,

24 there are 300 water rights comprising 788 cubic feet per
25 second.

The state engineer of Colorado testified that

I'm talking about findings.
Right, could look at the record,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

as New Mexico has even suggested, and determine these

conclusion of the Special Master and make a finding that

4

was reasonable conservation as was stated in Wyoming

5

versus Colorado, with reasonable conservation, as was

6 suggested in Nebraska versus Wyoming.
7

QUESTION*

Mr. Welborn, doesn’t that involve a

8

change in the theory of the Master?

As I read the

9

report, he would have found in your favor even if you

10

assumed some harm to New Mexico, because of the fact

11

that since the river was entirely appropriated, there is

12

nothing at all left for Colorado, and as a soveriegn

13

state it is entitled to some of the water.

14

Master’s theory.

15
16
17
18
19

MR. WELBORN*

That is the

And I think, Justice Stevens,

that is a proper rule of law.

But if you followed that rule, you

don’t need any more findings.
MR. WELBORN*

It is kind of a legal —

Yes, I think you do.

I

20 respectfully suggest that it is a matter of degree, and
21

this is exactly what this Court was dealing with in

22 Connecticut versus Massachusetts.

In Connecticut versus

23

Massachusetts, it was a matter of degree.

Sure, there

24

was going to be some effect on the Connecticut River

25

when the City of Boston took a tremendous quantity of

47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

water out of the river, and took it into the Kerimac

2 River, but the Court weighed the equities, and that is
3 what this Court has said in prior cases, and I
4 respectfully suggest that that is what the Special
5 Master did.
6

He said that Colorado is a sovereign state, and

7 it has certain interests that are above and beyond the
8 interests of its citizens, and above and beyond those
9 that would obtain in a controversy between private
10 parties, but he also found that there would be no
11 material injury, and there were material injury, there
12 would be countervailing — there are hard countervailing
13 equities in favor of Colorado, and it is these
14 countervailing equities, the Colorado need for water,
15 that is a basic factor here.
16

But as to the findings that this Court would

17 have to make to enter its decree, I think that the
18 Special Master’s report has the basic considerations
19 that he

— that are the result of his evaluation of this

20 very thorough record, and it would seem to me that they
21 would be virtually sufficient, in view of the law that
22 this Court has announced in its prior decision.
23

And this, of course, brings me to the last

24 point that I wanted to make in this argument, and that
25 is that the Special Master’s report is very much in

48
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

accord with these prior decisions.

2 the factors.

He considered all of

He properly rejected priority as the sole

3

consideration, and here again, I would respectfully

4

refer you to New Mexico’s own brief in Arizona versus

5

California, which refers to an equitable division of the

6

benefits, and rejects the idea of priority regardless of

7

state line.

8
9

It was there referring, I believe, to the
Wyoming versus Colorado case.

What New Mexico and the

10

amici really are seeking here, I suggest, is just that,

11

priority regardless of state line, a rule of law based

12 on these paper decrees, and those were sifted out, I
13
14

suggest, by the Special Master.
I can’t emphasize too strongly the difference

15

between the laws of these two states, even though the

16

follow the priority of appropriation doctrine,

17

difference in administration, difference in — Colorado

18

carries their water rights on the basis of historic use,

19

actual use.

The New Mexico officials testified, Mr.

20 Compton and Mr. Reynolds, that New Mexico carries them
21

on the basis of the decreed right.

And this stock farm

22 situation by impartial observers, so to speak, the
23

Bureau of Reclamation officials, is a most serious

24

matter which, if it existed in Colorado, would be

25

alleviated, because Colorado law provides for that.

49

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The Special Master did indeed consider

2 benefit-detriment.

This was first suggested in the

3 first case, Kansas versus Colorado.

It was reiterated

4 in the most recant case, Nebraska versus Wyoming, and
5 what he dii, I suggest, was do just what Nebraska versus
6 Wyoming told him to do.

He reached an informed judgment

7 on the basis of many factors, rejecting the priority of
8

appropriation as the sole consideration.

24 inopposita.

In each of those cases, there was water

Mr. Simms, may I ask you on that

If it ware not, if the law of

17 law as it is in New Mexico, would you make the same
18 argument?

Say they had the same law as they have in the

19 eastern states.
20
21

MR. SIMMS:

I think in either situation there

would still be the attempt by the Court to protect

22 existing economies.

That is the underlying theme of

23 every equitable apportionment case, no matter whether it
24 is between prior appropriation jurisdictions or between
25 appropration and vicarian as in Kansas versus Colorado.

In other words, are you willing to

2 say that the law of Colorado is irrelevant to your
3

position, simply because —

HR. SIMMS:

No, the law of Colorado is not

irrelevant to our position.

The law of Colorado has in

is embodied in the New Mexico constitution.

different in Colorado.

10

MR. SIMMS:

11

QUESTION:

If it were different —
If your argument depends entirely on

12

future use, then it would be irrelevant.

13

on the fact that they are both appropriative states,

14

then it is significant.

15

MR. SIMMS:

If it depends

No, if it were different, the

16

issues would be slightly different.

The fundamental,

17

the bottom line, however, remains the same, and that is,

18

the Court protects existing water rights.

Here, the

19

Masters recommended exactly the opposite.

He has just

20 flipped equitable apportionment decisions and priority,
21

22

its meaninj and significance, on its head.
QUESTION:

succeeds in appropriating all the water that it needs
