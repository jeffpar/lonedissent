ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK V. MEIERHENRY , ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

HR. MEIERHENRY:

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

7

please the Court, this is a case from the Eighth Circuit

8

that basically began three years ago.

9

Three years ago, a man by the name of Jerry

10

Helm appeared before a Circuit Court Judge within the

11

state of South Dakota and pled guilty to a felony.

12

felony happened to be his seventh felony within 15

13

years.

14

South Dakota had filed prior to that time its habitual

15

criminal statute and the defendant pled guilty to be a

16

habitual criminal and he was sentenced to life

17

imprisonment.

18

That

Judge Parker in that case, and the state of

The state of South Dakota contends that two

19

recent decisions of this Court take care of this

20

situation and have affirmatively stated that this is a

21

permissible sentence.

22

Davis and Rummel versus Estelle, in our opinion were

23

ignored by the Eighth Circuit.

24
25

Those two cases, Hutto versus

The Eighth Circuit reversed the District Court
within South Dakota after it had upheld the state of

1

South Dakota Supreme Court's decision, which decided

2

this was a permissible sentence and it did not violate

3

the Eighth Amendment.

4

The state of South Dakota petitioned for writ

5

of certiorari, was granted.

6

Court is whether a statutorily-authorized sentence of

7

life imprisonment without parole but with the right of

8

commutation for a non-violent habitual offender's

9

seventh felony constitutes cruel and unusual punishment

10

The question before this

under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.

11

Sr. Helm has been an active criminal.

He is

12

certainly an habitual criminal.

13

three times of burglary — in 1964,

14

obtaining money under false pretenses in

15

larceny in '73* a third offense, driving while

16

intoxicated, which requires three offenses within four

17

years, by the way, in 1975.

He has been convicted
*66, and ‘69; of
*72; of grand

The basic crime for which this case rests on

18
19

was writing a no-account check, which is a felony in

20

South Dakota, as in most other states, and it was for

21

the amount of $100.
South Dakota's habitual offender statute, we

22
23

have two.

One is for the first and second felony.

24

allows a circuit court judge to basically double

25

whatever the statutory sentence is.

It

commits their fourth sentence, our court or our circuit

2

court can sentence an individual anywhere from one day

3

to life.

4

imprisonment and, as is pointed out in the briefs, in

5

South Dakota life imprisonment requires that the

6

governor commute that to a term of years prior to the

7

time that parole begins.

In this particular case he was given life

We submit that this Court has decided this
case in Rummel versus Estelle.

It is just like the

10

state of Texas, only in effect a mirror image.

11

Texas, the parole board allows a parole, it must be

12

approved by the governor.

13

that the governor must first commute it to a term of

14

years, then assigns it to the parole board.

15

Ours is the other way around,

I also want to point out that the state of

South Dakota is more lenient than Texas.

sentence.

sentencing judge.

20

Texas

Here it is left to the discretion of the

These two cases -- I might point out that in

21

this case, as in the Rummel case, the defendant does not

22

challenge the habitual criminal statute of South Dakota,

23

nor does he contend that that statute is unfairly or

24

unconstitutionally applied as to his client.

25

states that this is cruel and unusual punishment.

He simply

1

The Eighth Circuit, at the oral argument,

2

noted that this life sentence for this individual on his

3

seventh felony within 15 years was a black day in legal

4

jurisprudence and that it was — it eventually held that

5

it was cruel and unusual.

6

QUESTION*

Attorney General, you mentioned

7

about this life imprisonment and parole.

8

this was without parole.

9

MR. MEIER HENRY:

That’s correct.

I understood

The — but

10

under — in the state of South Dakota, and I think the

11

appendix to the brief shows that, about 50 percent of

12

the time those people who get life sentences are

3

paroled, or at least over the period that the Eighth

4

Circuit asked for the information.

5

The process in South Dakota, and I think you

6

can see that in the lower judges’ statements to the

7

defendant, that an individual —

8

QUESTION*

It confused me.

9

MR. MEIERHENRY;

Well, an individual can be

20

commuted and in South Dakota that's the normal process.

2

For example, in Texas they have a little different

22

procedure.

23

acts.

24

our state, if someone gets a life sentence there is a

25

series of requests for commutation.

There the Board of Pardons and Paroles

Then the governor must approve their actions.

If the individual

In

1

is a man like Mr. Helm, maybe eventually the governor

2

will be convinced he's rehabilitated himself in prison,

3

will commute his sentence.
Once it's commuted to a term of years, it then

4
5

is just like any other individual in the state

6

penitentiary.

7

QUESTION*

Well, is this to say that every

8

sentence which is just a life sentence remains without

9

possibility of parole unless the governor commutes?
MR. MEIERHENRYi

10

That's correct, Your Honor.

11

Once the governor commutes it to a term of years,

12

whether it's ten years or 40 years —
QUESTION*

13
14

And how many offenses can result in

life sentences?
MR. MEIERHENRY*

15

Well, anything that's a Class

16

1 felony in South Dakota, which would include murder,

17

rape — the more serious offenses, Your Honor.

18

course, this habitual offender becomes a Class 1

19

felony.

20

And, of

For example, if, like in Hutto versus Davis,

21

the judge would have given Mr. Helm 40 years, under the

22

rules of South Dakota, he would have, before he's

23

eligible for parole, would have to serve 30 years.

24

other words, he would have gotten out of prison when he

25

was 66, 70 years old, assuming that he had done things

In

1

properly

2

So it's our view or-the state of South

3

Dakota's view that this Court has already decided this

4

factual situation.

5

difference between the death penalty and any term of

6

years, and in this case a life sentence is simply a term

7

of years measured by an individual's life.

8

It's determined that there’s a

This Court also discussed, and other courts

9

have discussed, the possibility of parole.

You have it

10

in this case, only it's not called parole.

It’s called

11

commutation.

12

leniency.

13

In both instances it is executive

QUESTION»

Yes, but isn't there a difference

14

in the parole situation?

15

a very significant number of people, whereas here

16

nobody's gotten it for the last ten or 12 years, as I

17

understand it.

It is correct nobody’s gotten it

since 1975?
MR. MEIERHENRY;

That’s correct.

But over the

period of time —
QUESTION»

I suppose there have been people

who have been put on parole in South Dakota since 1975.

HR. MEIERHENRY:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. MEIERHENRY:

4

There have

Probably quite a lot of them.
There have.

The average stay

in our South Dakota penitentiary is about 2-1/2 years.

5

QUESTION:

Would you — because I had not

6

found it in the record, at the beginning you recited the

7

convictions.

8

In '64 it was a burglary, was it?

9

Could you tell me again what were they?

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Yes, sir.

I'll repeat them.

10

There were three burglary convictions — 1964, 1966,

11

1969.
In 1972, while out for a short period of time

12

13

he was convicted of obtaining money under false

14

pretenses.

15

larceny.

16

intoxicated, which in South Dakota requires three

17

convictions for driving while intoxicated within a

18

four-year period.

Again, he was out of prison in 1973, grand
1975, third offense, driving while

He's actually got more than that.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. MEIEEHENRY:

21

22

And then this $100 check item.
And then the $100 no-account

check in 1979.
QUESTION:

So then it's correct that from

1973

23

on, he had one conviction for drunken driving, which

24

probably had meant there were a couple others before,

25

because it was a felony, and the $100 check.

In ten

years he had those two convictions

2

MR. MEIERHENRY;

Well, from *73 to '79 -- he's

3

been in prison, Justice, since

4

period he was convicted of three felonies, and you must

5

remember that he was in prison during part of that

6

time.

7

felony every 5.3 months he's out of prison, so he's a

8

rather active and, I think, the perfect habitual

9

criminal example.

10

'79, so in that six-year

I calculated he commits a serious misdemeanor or

QUESTION*

Mr. Attorney General, as I read

11

your statute, am I correct that if somebody commits a

12

felony and it's shown that he's had three prior — I

13

mean, four prior misdemeanor convictions he can get

14

life?

No, he can't.

QUESTION;

Good.

23

MR. MEIERHENRY:

— that everybody assumed we

— that it was meant by a felony conviction, but that

25

was changed.

No individual — it has to be a felony in

HR. HEIERHENRY;

Over $200?
Over $200.

HR. HEIERHENRY:

Well, it is now $200, but in

15

1973 it could have been $50.

16

had to account for inflation, I guess, and so during the

17

’70s it did go up.
QUESTION;

I'm not precise, but we

Was there a dollar value on the

burglary in the third degree, or was it just any entry?
HR. HEIERHENRY:

20

No.

And I don’t think

21

that — I guess the state of South Dakota -- But the

22

dollar value, this Court’s already held that in Texas we

23

could look at $280.
But I don’t think the amount of the crime is

24
25

important.

I don’t think it’s a serious argument made —

3

QUESTION:

You'd make the same argument if in

each of the three burglaries he stole a quart of liquor?
MR. MEIER HENRY :

Yes.

It's the crime.

As

4

least in South Dakota, determined by the legislature, a

5

burglary is a felony and it is such in most every state

6

in the Onion, as far as I know, and here is an

7

individual that on six occasions, although our

8

legislature said three strikes, he got six strikes, and

9

I think the fact that there was no violence involved

10

allowed and permitted the executive branch not to file

11

an habitual criminal enhancement against him on his

12

fourth felony, his fifth felony and his sixth felony.

13

It wasn't until the seventh felony that a

prosecutor finally said, enough.

2

QUESTION;

He waived it, here, didn't he?

3

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Yes, he did.

And, of course,

4

being an old defense lawyer myself, that's sometimes the

5

wisest thing to do if you have a client like Mr. Helm,

6

is just not tell the court the least amount possible

7

because in this case, were he to have a pre-sentence,

8

our record only goes back 15 years, so I can't argue to

9

you what occurred before that.

But this gentleman's only 36 years old and so

let's just go back the 15 years.

rehabilitated.

What would have happened if in each

one of these burglaries he was stiff drunk and broke in

23

I doubt if —

Isn't that different from breaking

MR. MEIERHENRY;

So he broke in and he

Only after three loaves of bread.
Well, if you want to look at

Of course, there is some individual who

10

lost three loaves of bread and under our definition in

11

South Dakota, which is a small state, we know that

12

individuals like Mr. Helm, who have had six cracks at

13

the penitentiary -- six times they've gone in there.

14

They've been — gone through the fish tank, as it's

15

called, and they get their hair cut and they go through

16

each step, and on six occasions that didn't seem to

17

impede him at all.
Under the laws in South Dakota, we protect

18

people first and property second, and it's clear that

there is no logical way to protect the people of South

Mr. Burnett.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. BURNETTs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

5

the Court, Mr. Helm has been deprived of his freedom for

6

life by the punishment involved in this case.

7

The state of South Dakota argues that this

8

Court should not even consider whether such an extremely

harsh punishment has any relationship to the severity of

10

the crimes that Mr. Halm was convicted of.

MR. BURNETT:

Rummel v. Estelle, tliis Court did uphold the life

2

sentence on a Texas recidivist convicted of three prior

3

felonies, but in Rummel this Court refrained from

4

applying the proportionality principle espoused in the

5

cases of Coker v. Georgia, and Weems v. United States.

6

Now the reason this Court felt compelled to

7

hold back from applying a proportionality analysis in

8

that case was because the punishments involved in Weems

9

and Coker could be clearly distinguished, a bright line

10

could be drawn between those punishments and traditional

11

forms of imprisonment, while no such bright line could

12

be drawn between Hummel's punishment and traditional

13

forms of imprisonment.

14

In this case, there is no such fear of a more

15

extensive intrusion into the line-drawing process of the

16

legislature, as there was in Rummel, because a bright

17

line can be drawn in this case and between traditional

18

forms of imprisonment.

19

In Hummel, Your Honor, this Court, in

3

Now those points brought out by Justice

4

Stewart’s opinion, quoted in Eummel, Rummel’s sentence

6

eligibility for parole in 12 years meant that his

sentence was not irrevokable and his eligibility for

not reject his rehabilitation completely.

commute his sentence.

I

That’s, of course, the judgment

7

that the South Dakota legislature made, saying that in

8

these circumstances of multiple felonies that they would

rule out that possibility.

10
11

I take it you say that the

Eighth Amendment forbids that.
MR. BURNETT:

Your Honor, what I’m saying is

12

that the Eighth Amendment requires -- I think there were

13

two tests laid out in Coker.

14

punishment be not grossly proportionate to the offense

15

and that it make -- well, then, of course, a negligible

16

contribution test also.

17

It requires that a

My contention is. Your Honor, and I think it's

18

based on decisions of this Court, that the

19

proportionality requirement of the Coker test, also

20

mentioned in Weems v. United States, the punishment must

21

be graduated in proportion to the offense, that that

22

puts a limit in accordance with the rehabilitative

23

rationale of punishment on the extent to which the state

24

can use utilitarian rationale in imposing a punishment.

would — again, without knowing anything more about it,

11

I would say that I would definitely have problems with a

12

sentence like that.

13

could see that it could be analogized to this, then.

14

QUESTION;

I’d have to look at it more, but I

You would suggest that the Court

15

would have to apply proportionality analysis to terms of

16

years as well, then, I take it?

17

MR. BURNETT:

18

QUESTION:

Excuse me, Your Honor?

Your argument suggests that this

19

Court would have to apply your same proportionality

20

analysis even to sentences for specified terms of

21

years .

22

MR . BURNETT:

What I’m saying. Your Honor, is

23

if a sentence cannot be clear -- if you can clearly

24

distinguish a sentence from traditional sentences of

25

imprisonment, which a term of year sentence normally is,

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

then a bright line could be drawn between that sentence

2

and the proportionality test, as applied in Coker should

3

apply.

4

In other words, Rummel v. Estelle is

5

distinguishable from that sentence.

6

addressing your question, too.

7

you, like for instance a sentence for a term of years,

8

for 895 years, with no eligibility for parole, would, in

QUESTION:

17

MR. BURNETT:

Well, you go to the tables.
Okay.

Well, you could predict

18

on the tables, but even then what I'm stating, Your

19

Honor, is that the sentence that is designed to ensure

20

that a person is in prison for the rest of his life,

21

that does not consider his rehabilitation completely,

22

that rejects his rehabilitation completely, that that

23

sentence cannot be clearly distinguishable from the

24

death penalty, as was the sentence involved in Rummel.

25

And such a sentence is clearly distinguishable

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

from traditional forms of imprisonment.

2

most sentences of imprisonment, and most traditional

forms of imprisonment are not designed to keep someone

Coker in applying that proportionality principle.

3

important that the Court be informed by objective

4

factors to the maximum extent possible.

5

It's

Now there are three objective factors, I

6

think, that have been identified.

7

nature of the offense.

8

would contrast quite sharply from any of the offenses

9

that Helm was convicted of.

Number one, the

Now, for instance, rape, I think

In other words, the first

10

objective factor would be considering the nature of the

11

offfense in terms of the harm caused, the harmfulness of

12

the offense, and the mens rea with which it was

13

committed, comparing that with the punishment

14

inflicted.

15

The second objective factor is comparing the

16

sentence imposed in that jurisdiction with the sentences

17

imposed in other jurisdictions.

18

course, is the sentence imposed on other criminals for

19

different crimes within the same state.

20

And the third, of

Now I would not -- I'd have to subject the

21

crime of rape.

22

objective factors would indicate that a life sentence

23

without parole would be warranted for that particular —

24
25

My suspicion right now is that all those

QUESTION:

But under your test, if only two

states in fact impose that sort of a punishment, those

30

MR. BURNETT:

No, Your Honor.

The combined --

3

that's just one of the three objective factors that I'd

4

use.

5

have been sentenced to life imprisonment without parole

6

for the offenses he was convicted of in this case.

There is only one other state where Helm could

7

But again I understand the concern with

8

Federalism in applying just that interjurisdictional

9

analysis.

But it is one objective factor that the Court

10

can apply in determining the guestion of whether a

11

punishment is proportionate to the offense committed.

12

QUESTION:

But wasn't this, your whole

13

approach, pretty well rejected by the Court opinion in

14

Rummel?

15
16
17

MR. BURNETT:

My approach was rejected by the

Court —
QUESTION;

I mean, this breaking it down into

18

numerous so-called objective factors.

19

the approach taken by the Court of Appeals for the

20

Fourth Circuit in Hart against Coiner, as I recall, and

21

I thought the Court opinion in Rummel rejected that.

22

MR. BURNETT:

That was really

Your Honor, the Court opinion in

23

Rummel, I think, it rejected that for one reason, and

24

that was that Rummel’s sentence could not be clearly

25

separated, a bright line could not be drawn between

31
AIDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Rummel's sentence and traditional forms of

2

imprisonment.

3

punishment was unconstitutional would involve the Court

4

in the line-drawing process, preeminently the province

5

of the legislature.

6

Therefore, for the Court to say that his

Therefore, the Court in Rummel distinguished

7

Rummel's sentence from the death penalty in Coker.

8

reason that this case is different than Rummel and

9

Rummel does not apply to this case is because when

The

10

you're talking about life imprisonment without parole

11

you are not talking about a sentence that's clearly

12

distinguishable from the death penalty.

13

You're talking about a sentence that

14

approaches the irrevokability of a death sentence.

15

You're talking about a sentence that rejects

16

rehabilitation completely, as the death penalty does.

17

So for that reason the Court’s fear in applying the

18

proportionality analysis of intruding more extensively

19

than was required in Weems and in Coker into the

20

line-drawing process is not present in this case.

21

the reason that Rummel did not decide this case is

22

because that fear in Rummel is not present.

23

Now Coker v.

Georgia,

So

when it talked about the

24

objective factors — and I think it was pointed out in

25

Rummel — that there was a certain degree of

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

subjectivity involved in at least two of the objective

2

factors that were argued in Rummel and that are argued

3

here — the nature of the offense and the

4

inter jurisdictional comparisons.

5

In Coker v. Georgia, this Court said to the

6

maximum extent possible.

7

was stated that objective factors cannot determine this

8

controversy entirely, for the Constitution contemplates

9

our own judgment should be brought to bear.

10

Also, in Coker v. Georgia, it

Now what — I'm telling Your Honors that

11

interjurisdictional comparison does indicate by itself

12

that the sentence in this case is unconstitutional,

13

disproportionate to the punishment compared to every

14

other state in the country.

15

Number two, analyzing that with the two other

16

objective factors, which also indicate that his sentence

17

is grossly disproportionate to the punishment, those

18

three objective factors, utilizing them, do indicate —

treat the offense as simply the seventh felony.

moral blameworthiness, which I think is about the best

justification I*ve heard for enhanced penalties for an

15

habitual offender — increased blameworthiness.

He's already been

The fact that he commits another

And you analyze that blameworthiness with the

harm involved and so for that reason I think the last

felony is more important than the other felonies.

involving a gun or some type of threat of -- violent

offense, it would be different.

QUESTIONS

Is it a general practice to omit or

to waive the pre-sentence reports?

24

MR. BURNETTs

25

QUESTIONS

No, Your Honor, it's not.

Would it not be particularly

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

important to have a pre-sentence report on a seventh

2

felony conviction with the invocation of the habitual

3

criminal statute?

4

MR. BURNETT:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. BURNETT:

I would think so. Your Honor.

He waived it here, didn't he?
He did, Your Honor.

I think the

7

Eighth Circuit, in their opinion in this case, although

8

knowing the fact that he had waived his right to a

9

pre-sentence investigation, suggested that one be done

10
11
12

in this case and I certainly think -QUESTION;

Under -- what authority did the

Eighth Circuit have to make that sort of suggestion?

13

MR. BURNETT:

14

QUESTION;

15
16

What?

What authority did the Eighth

Circuit have to make that sort of suggestion?
MR. BURNETT:

No authority, Your Honor.

It

17

was just a suggestion that they made in the case in a

18

footnote, I believe.

19

cited, nothing like that.

20

their feeling that in imposing such a drastic sentence,

21

life in prison without parole, on the minimal knowledge

22

that the judge had about the offender, and imposing a

23

punishment that completely rejected his rehabilitation,

24

that certain — more things should be known about him in

25

determining the punishment that should be imposed upon

There is no authority.

No case is

him

2

Wow, as I mentioned, the first objective

3

factor is the nature of the offenses.

4

out that the prior felonies of Mr. Helm in this case

5

were, as I think the Court's already been informed,

6

three third-degree burglaries, one grand theft, one

7

obtaining money under false pretenses, and one third

8

offense driving while intoxicated, and then the $100

9

no-account check.

10

Now it's pointed

None of those offenses involve violence.

I

11

know that this Court pointed out in Rummel v. Estelle

12

that distinguishing between violent and non-violent

13

crimes involves a subjective judgment more eminently the

14

problem of the legislature.

c

15

One thing I could inform the Court of is that

16

there have been surveys taken of the general

17

population.

18

was decided — I think 28 Wayne Law Journal number 3 —

19

indicated that the population as a whole in this country

20

does draw a bright line between violent and non-violent

21

crimes.

22

One that I know was completed after Rummel

When that is combined with the fact of Mr.

23

Helm's alcoholism and you consider the harm involved in

24

his offenses with the mens rea that they were committed,

25

I think — and I would submit that alcoholism does

affect the mens rea with which an offense is committed -

2

QUESTION;

Well, if it affects the mens rea

3

sufficiently, the elements of the offense aren't made

4

out, are they?

5

MR. BURNETT:

6

QUESTION;

No, they're not, Your Honor.

So presumably in each offense which

7

he was found guilty of there was the necessary intent,

8

whether or not he might have been drinking.

•

MR. BURNETT:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Um-hum.

So I don't see why it would affect

the mens rea.
MR. BURNETT:

12

I’m just saying in terms of

13

punishment, Your Honor.

14

mens rea to the extent that it would totally obliterate

15

mens rea, therefore affecting an element of the

16

offense.

17

QUESTION;

Alcoholism could affect the

Well, but then he wouldn't be

18

guilty of the offense.

19

MR. BURNETT;

No, he wouldn't be guilty of the

20

offense in that case.

21

it does not affect his mens rea to the extent to totally

22

obliterate it, that still is a factor to be considered

23

in assessing his moral blameworthiness for the

24

commission of the act.

25

QUESTION:

But what I'm saying is, even if

You say if he had been drinking and

38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

then formed the intent to commit a burglary and

2

committed the burglary, he is less blameworthy than

3

someone who hadn't been drinking and formed the intent

4

to commit a burglary and committed the burglary?

5
6

MR. BURNETT;
because of —

7
8

In general, yes, Your Honor,

QUESTION;

You think that's implicit in the

Eighth Amendment?

9

MR. BURNETT;

I don't think it — I think it's

10

implicit in the Eighth Amendment to the extent -- and

11

this is going to be rather involved — but it's implicit

12

in the Eighth Amendment to this extent, that the Eighth

13

Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.

14

has been held by this Court to require that the

15

punishment be graduated in proportion to the offense.
That that proportionality requirement requires

16
17

That

distributive justice.

That distributive justice —

18

QUESTION:

What is distributive justice?

19

MR. BURNETT:

It means that a person should be

20

treated as an individual, that justice should be

21

gauged — his sentence should be gauged to his personal

22

culpability, his personal blameworthiness for the

23

offense that he did and the actual harm that was

24

caused.

25

In other words, I think, for instance, in

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Robinson v. California the state may be threatened a lot

2

by drug addicts, but distributive justice requires that

3

they cannot be treated as criminals unless they have

done something voluntary.

Well, in this case at one time he

was convicted of driving while drunk.

7

MR. BURNETT;

9
10

Well, that is close to a crime of

violence, but by sheer accident it wasn’t violence.
Isn’t that right?

Would that entitle him

Well, put it this way.

2

MR. BURNETT:

Well, I don't — I'd still argue

3

that I would have, I think, that there would still be

4

problems under the Eighth Amendment in imposing a life

5

sentence without parole for those.

6

lot more than just that, but I think that driving while

7

intoxicated, although it was true the danger of the

8

offense, I think there's no intent there to cause

9

anybody any injury.

10

I'd have to know a

And that, I think, would be something that

11

should be considered in determining what punishment

12

should be imposed for that offense.

You mean there’s no intent to do

injury, yet you know what could happen.

MR. BURNETT:

while drunk.

MR. BURNETT*

Yes, Your Honor.

It's just —

23

the only thing I'm saying is this. Your Honor.

I don’t

think that I could -- I don’t think it could quite be

compared, the mans rea of a person driving a car while

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

intoxicated with the mens rea of a person that, like,

2

for instance, takas a gun into a store, give me all your

guilty frame of mind.

MR. BURNETT:

Yes —

robbery or otherwise drives over him in a truck while

The dead person is just as dead.

MR. BURNETT:

He's 40 today, because I think

3

he was sentenced when he was 36, which would have been

4

*79, so he’s 40, I think, at this date.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. BURNETT:

Okay.
Then, finally, the last

7

objective factor that I mentioned, inter jurisdictional

8

approach. South Dakota — the only people in South

9

Dakota that could be — receive a life sentence without

10

parole, as Mr. Helm did, would be someone convicted of

11

murder, first-degree manslaughter, first-degree arson or

12

kid napping.

13

All the offenses, then, for which a person can

14

receive life imprisonment outside of the one Mr. Helm

15

was convicted of, involve violence or the threat of

16

violence or death to

17

other hand, has never in his life committed any offense

18

involving violence or the threat of violence or any

19

injury to the person of another.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

another

person.

Mr. Helm, on the

You don't think drunken driving

involves any threat to the person of another?
MR. BURNETT:

Well, Your Honor, it would if

23

there was an accident involved.

To that extent, any

24

time you drive while intoxicated there would be a threat

25

of injury to another person.

But to the extent that you

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

commit an offense where you, for instance, in robbery

2

where you threaten violence in order to obtain money,

3

that certainly doesn't apply to a third offense DWI.

4

So for that reason I do not count third

5

offense DWI as an offense involving injury to the person

6

of another or the threat of violence or a violent

7

offense, for that matter.

8

would certainly have to agree that there was violence

9

involved.

10

When an accident happened, I

So comparison of the laws of the state of

11

South Dakota and how South Dakota treats other criminals

12

also indicates that the punishment in this case is

13

excessive compared to the offense.

14

Every one of these objective factors,

15

considered separately — the nature of the offense in

16

teems of the harm involved and the mens rea with which

17

it was committed, compared to the punishment, the first

18

objective factor, to the interjurisdictional comparison,

19

the fact that Nevada is the only state out of South

20

Dakota — outside of South Dakota in this whole country

21

where Mr. Helm could have received a sentence of life

22

without parole for the offenses he was convicted of, and

23

thirdly, the fact that South Dakota punishes only

24

people, outside of Mr. Helm, convicted of violent crimes

25

or crimes involving violence, or injury to a person of

44

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

another — all of these objective factors, considered

2

separately, indicate that Mr. Helm's sentence in this

3

case is grossly disportionate to his punishment.

4

When all three objective factors are

5

considered together, it should compel the conclusion, in

6

this case, that his sentence is grossly disproportionate

7

to his punishment.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK V. MEIERHENRY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

5

6

9

Mr. Attorney General?

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Just a brief rebuttal, Your

Honors.
I would call the Court's attention to the
appendix, specifically page 22.

I think by reviewing

10

the appendix, wherein the 45 individuals who are serving

11

life for all sorts of crimes in South Dakota are listed,

12

you will see that this idea that was mentioned in my

13

colleague's argument that South Dakota is overly harsh

14

is just not the case.

15

He only have three individuals in our entire

16

penitentiary who have been there over 23 years, so I

17

think that -- that it's fairly clear that most people,

18

even if they murder, maim and rape people, do not spend

19

all of their natural lives in the South Dakota

20

penitentiary.

21

Additionally, I'd like to point out that from

22

the record that in 1975 this man Helm was convicted of

23

driving while intoxicated, third offense, which means

24

three within four years.

25

convicted of two more during this interim from 1975

Subsequently to that he's been
