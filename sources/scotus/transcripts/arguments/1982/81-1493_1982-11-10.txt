CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Miller.

3

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR R. MILLER, ESQ.,

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5
6

MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
The issue in this case is whether the State of

7
8

Illinois can assert jurisdiction over more than 168,000

9

citizens of every state, the District of Columbia,

10

Puerto Rico and Canada when those people have had no

11

contacts with Illinois.

12

QUESTION:

Excuse me, Mr. Miller.

May I ask

13

at the outset, do we know that that's what the State of

14

Illinois is going to do here?

15

MR. MILLER:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
How do we know that?

There's been

17

no — no determination of any of these issues, has

18

there?

19

judgment yet in this case?

What I'm getting at, do we really have a final

MR. MILLER:

20

We have a final judgment on the

21

question of Illinois’ capacity to assert jurisdiction

22

over the non-resident class members under the Fourteenth

23

Amendment.

24

unequivocally held that the International Shoe test

25

established by this Court is inapplicable to

But we don’t know whether actually

*
ft*

4

In that sense

MR. MILLER:

No.

The one issue that the

7

Illinois Supreme Court leaves open to the Illinois Trial

8

Court is the question of manageability.

9

it’s reasonably clear given the directiveness of the

But I think

10

mandate of the Illinois Supreme Court that at a minimum

11

the Illinois Trial Court will certify a class consisting

12

of all non-residents whose rights arise under laws that

13

they would deem to be similar.

14

QUESTION:

Well, I’m just wondering whether we

15

have to address that issue until we find out that's what

16

the Illinois court’s going to do.

17

MR. MILLER:

It is inconceivable to me,

18

Justice Brennan, that there is any issue left open with

19

regard to the question of the applicability of minimum

20

contacts and the power of the State of Illinois to

21

assert jurisdiction.

22

QUESTION:

How about the class action?

Has

there been an order here?

MR. MILLER:

Illinois Supreme Court to the Illinois Trial Court to

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

consider this question of manageability under the laws
of the other 49 states of the Onion.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose one of your

answers, Mr. Miller, might be that the Court, granted
certiorari.
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

Yes.
And perhaps a response would be

that only four Justices are required to grant certiorari.
(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

And another might be that there's

an instrument called DIG which translates "dismissed as
improvidentiy granted."
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

Well, I —
But as long as four want it

granted, they're supposed to decide it on the merits.
MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

I think —
That's the full four anyway.

MR. MILLER:

I think you've covered all the

possibilities now.
(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

Yes, but no one raised the final

judgment question at the certiorari stage.

In all

candor, I didn't think of it then, and I have thought of
it now; so I don't consider myself bound by the four
votes to the contrary.

•\

MR. MILLER*

Let me simply add that the last

2

four cases that this Court has heard involving questions

3

of state court jurisdiction — Shaffer, Kulki, Woodson,

4

and Rush — have all come to this Court on a motion to

5

dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.

6

QUESTION*

But the difference is that in each

7

of those cases the entire litigation might have

8

terminated depending on how this Court decided the

9

issue, whereas here it really is not even certain that

10

there will be a class any broader than the Illinois

11

residents, because it's theoretically possible that a

12

judge sitting in Cook County might decide that all other

13

states have different rules or they're enough different

14

that he doesn’t want to fuss around with anything except

15

an Illinois class.

16

MR. MILLER*

Yes.

Two modest addenda.

One

17

would be in the Woodson case there was no certainty that

18

the action would terminate because there were other

19

defendants remaining before the Court.

20

Second, as I indicated to Justice Brennan, the

21

mandate of the Illinois Supreme Court is so directive

22

that the Illinois Trial Court would be hard-pressed to

23

dismiss a non-resident subclass of those people coming

24

from states whose laws were characterized as similar to

25

the Illinois consumer protection statute.

1
2

seem to me possible that the trial judge could say well,

3

there are no other laws quite like ours.

4

have to do some research to find out whether that’s

5

plausible or not, but it's at least theoretically

6

possible.

7

\

Yes, I agree with that, but it does

BE. HILLER:

I mean we'd

It is theoretically possible.

8

Justice Stevens.

Might I just add that there is

9

language in Cox Broadcasting v. Cohn and the comparable

10

language in an in-chambers opinion in Rosenblatt v.

11

American Cyanimide indicates that this is the kind of

12

question where the issue, this issue, this central issue

13

may never come back to this Court, and you have, in

14

effect, a destabilized situation.

15

In Cohn you will recall it was the question of

16

the restraint on publication in Georgia of a rape

17

victim's name.

18

issue was important enough to resolve lest it not come

19

back and leave everyone in a quandary.

20

The Supreme Court in that case felt that

I think as one looks around the country these

21

days, one finds a greater and greater assertion by state

22

courts, national class actions, some states not

23

asserting those class actions: and we have a situation

24

in which a good many judgments are potentially unstable

25

and subject to collateral attack.

QUESTIONS

But as you argue on the merits,

this case is the most extreme that has arisen.
MR. MILLER;

Absolutely.

I think this case is

4

extreme because there is undisputed evidence in the

5

record that Gillette is incorporated in Delaware,

6

principal place of business is in Massachusetts.

7

Accent table lighter, which is the source of the

8

consumer claim in this case, that promotion was planned

9

and executed in Massachusetts.

The

All receipts of

10

applicants for the promotion were handled in Minnesota.

11

No aspect —

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. MILLER;

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. MILLER;

Why Minnesota, do you know?
Yes, yes.

Spotts International, a

16

promotional processing house, is located in Minnesota.

17

So Gillette gave that company the business to improve

18

the employment situation in that state.

19

All the promotions went to Minnesota.

The

20

requests for the Accent table lighter came from every

21

state in the Union, Puerto Rico, the District of

22

Columbia, and Canada.

23

except an attempt to promote responses to the promotion

24

in Illinois.

Nothing was done in Illinois

MR. KILLER:

6

QUESTION;

9

MR. MILLER:

The class is frozen now

It is?
— The promotion has ended.

QUESTION:

What about those who would claim

they would have applied but for some theory?
MR. MILLER:

13

I think one would be hard-pressed

14

to make that claim four years after the promotion.

15

promotion took place in 1978.

16

unrealistic that anyone else will come out of the

17

woodwork.

The

Again, I think it*s

There is the possibility that the class

19

actually will shrink to some slight degree if Illinois

20

goes forward with the opt out option.

21

some indication that certain members of the class of

22

people who did not receive the lighter feel that their

23

claims, to the extent that they even thought that they

24

had claims, were more than fairly compromised since

25

Gillette did return their money, did send a letter of

explanation, and did send them a free Cricket lighter.

2

Indeed -QUESTION:

3

Mr. Miller, how -- I suppose the

4

real parties in interest here are the members of the

5

class, if it's certified.

6

cause of action we're talking about.

7

Gillette have the right to come in and raise the

8

question now for their benefit or the lack thereof?
MR. MILLER:

9

They're the people whose
And how does

This Court in Hanson and Denckla

10

allowed Florida defendants to assert a lack of

11

jurisdiction over a Delaware trustee.
QUESTION:

12
13

Wasn't that an indispensable party

situation?

14

MR. MILLER:

15

QUESTION:

Yes, it was.

Yes, it was.

Which would go to whether the Court

16

had jurisdiction over the case.

17

similar to letting Gillette come in and argue on behalf

18

of the potential class —

19

MR. MILLER:

I don't think that's

With great deference, I would

20

argue that there are very few people more indispensable

21

to an action than the plaintiffs.

22

168,000 involuntary, nonvolitional plaintiffs who have

23

not indicated to any degree that they are interested in

24

pursuing this claim.

25

We are talking about

The problem for Gillette from a standing
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

perspective is that if the Illinois Supreme Court

2

opinion is allowed to stand, it will be subjected to the

3

claims of these 168,000 nonvolitional plaintiffs in

4

Illinois in what I think must be characterized as a

5

frighteningly monstrous, in complexity terms, lawsuit

6

followed by a judgment that has, unless this Court

7

speaks, extremely dubious full faith and credit

8

implications.
We are now in the position of looking at the

9
10

168,000 nonvolitional plaintiffs and realizing they have

11

no incentive to come forward at this time.

12

Pragmatically they have not received notice.
QUESTION;

13
14

But under the Illinois court order

they would be given notice, as I understand it.

15

MR. MILLER;

16

QUESTION;

17

MR. MILLER;

They will be given notice.
And they can opt out.
But if I might just pursue the

18

standing point for a moment, they have no notice at this

19

point.

20

jurisdiction is or isn't established.

21

little incentive to come in.

22

are only for $7.95 apiece.

23

a heads-I-win/tails-you-lose situation; because if they

24

remain on the outside of the action and the case goes to

25

judgment and the class prevails, they can take advantage

They will not get notice until some time after

of it.

2

can then make the very argument that we are making at

3

this point.

4

But should Gillette prevail on the merits, they

QUESTION!

Well, that's just a typical class

5

action suit.

It may not be — I suppose you would say

6

they could have a class action of all Illinois residents.

7

MR. MILLERs

8

QUESTION!

9

MR. MILLERi

11

QUESTIONS

13

Well, that would — the same thing

would be true of all of those people.

10

12

Yes, yes.

I do not think that is as clear.
Well, they can opt out and take

advantage of it.
MR. MILLERs

They can opt out, but if they opt

14

out, my understanding of the Illinois opt out law is

15

that they cannot then take advantage if they opt out.

16

QUESTION!

Well, do you think Gillette would

17

really, if it lost the case, really defend against

18

another party in the same position?

MR. MILLERs
issue at this point.

21

QUESTIONS

22

speak to it at all.

23

It's very hard to speak to that

MR. MILLERs

Well, I don’t think it's hard to

The fact remains, Justice White,

24

that the theory of the Hanson and Denckla standing point

25

is equally applicable in this situation because those
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Florida defendants were making exactly the same point

2

with regard to that indispensable Delaware trustees

3

unless you get him in now or determine that he can't be

4

brought in now, we are subjected to this litigation and

5

a threat of second litigation.

6

QUESTION:

Right.

7

QUESTION*

Mr. Miller, am I right in thinking

8

that Gillette raises no minimum contacts constitutional

9

arguments in its own behalf?

10

MR. MILLER*

11

QUESTION*

12

MR. MILLER*

13

QUESTION:

In its own behalf, no.
I am right.
You are right.
Could a plaintiff from Montana then

14

come to Illinois and file an action against Gillette for

15

the lighter?

16

MR. MILLER*

17

QUESTION*

18
19

In the Illinois court, yes.
Yes.

And could a group of

plaintiffs get together and do that?
MR. MILLER*

A group of plaintiffs

20

volitionally can accede or consent or seek out the

21

jurisdiction of the Illinois courts.

22

QUESTION*

So are you basically saying that

23

due process allows an opt in procedure but not an opt

24

out procedure?

25

MR. MILLER*

I think if the State of Illinois
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

chose to pursue its consumer protection policy by

2

enacting a statute that provided a mechanism of inviting

3

non-resident class members to opt in to an Illinois

4

action, that would be constitutional.
What it seems to Gillette offends the

5
6

Constitution is the attempt by the State of Illinois to

7

assert jurisdiction over a group of people who have not

8

manifested any acquiescence in Illinois jurisdiction.
QUESTION;

9
10
11

Even under the notice and opt out

procedure.
MR. MILLER;

I think what this Court has

12

decided in an unbroken line of cases from International

13

Shoe is that in the absence of minimum contacts between

14

a state and a party, that state cannot assert

15

jurisdiction under the due process clause of the

16

Fourteenth Amendment.

17
18
19

QUESTION;

But weren't those all minimum

contacts required on behalf of the defendant?
MR. HILLER:

Yes, yes, except conceivably the

20

Mullane case.

21

Zimmerman Brush clearly stated that a cause of action is

22

a property right under the Fourteenth Amendment.

23

This Court last year in Logan v.

It seems to me impossible to draw a

24

distinction between holding a defendant liable for $7.95

25

and issuing a decree or a judgment that forecloses a
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

plaintiff from asserting a claim for £7.95.

And it

2

seems to me that is basically the issue that was before

3

this Court in Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank and Trust

4

Company where at issue were the claims by a variety of

5

non-New York trust beneficiaries with regard to the

6

settlement of a New York trustee's accounts.

7

Justice Jackson writing for the Court in that case made

8

it very clear that he was quite concerned from a

9

jurisdictional perspective about the foreclosure effect

And

10

on those beneficiaries of not being able to charge the

11

New York trustee with fraud or mismanagement or

12

excessive fees.
It seems to me that this case is a little

13
14

different -- indeed, it is not different — from any

15

attempt by say Gillette —
QUESTION:

16

Mr. Miller, after all, there would

17

be notice and an opportunity to opt out.

18

opt out you think isn't equivalent to consent?

19

MR. MILLER:

20

QUESTION:

No, I do not.

And failing to

Again --

I'd certainly have to say that

21

because you have just said that if there was consent, if

22

they voluntarily came into Illinois, it would be quite

23

all right.

24
25

MR. MILLER:

I think that is right, but I

think the Court's opinions, particularly the last four
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

opinions, have been absolutely clear in drawing

2

distinctions between three elements — among three

3

elements of due process:

4

opportunity to be heard.

5

jurisdiction, notice, and an

The Respondents, and I fear the Illinois

6

Supreme Court, have simply made it appear as if there

7

were only requirements of notice and opt out or opt --

8
9

10
11

12
13

QUESTION;

Suppose there was proof that a

person hadn't — a person had notice, and he decided not
to opt out?
MR. MILLER:

I do not see how the State of

Illinois could bind that person.
QUESTION:

This Court's opinion -

He could say — he could sit right

14

there and say well, if it turns out well, that's fine;

15

if it turns out bad, 1*11 sue him anyway.

16
17

MR. MILLER:

The author of Insurance

Corporation of Ireland one year ago said —

18

QUESTION;

19

(Lau ghter.)

20

MR. MILLER;

I thought you would get to that.

— Made it very clear that an

21

individual who feels there is no jurisdiction in the

22

tribunal may simply ignore the proceedings.

23

QUESTION:

He does so at some risk, of course.

24

QUESTION;

At his peril.

25

MR. MILLER:

He does so at some risk, but not

much risk if it is true that there is no jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

They can't bind him just by his

failing to object.
HR. HILLER:

I do not see how the State of

5

Illinois can write me a letter in Massachusetts and say

6

"Hi, this is notige we have an action going.

7

the privilege" —

8

QUESTION:

9

HR. MILLER:

You have

Either speak up or be stuck.
That's right.

That is not the

10

purposeful availing that the Court has spoken of.

That

11

is not a contact or tie or relation with a forum.

That

12

is a unilateral act by a third person.

13

seem to me that notice, opt out, or even adequacy of

14

representation can constitutionally fill the gap.

15

QUESTION:

And it does not

What about our decision last term

16

in Underwriters National Assurance Company where a state

17

court exercised jurisdiction in what amounted to a class

18

action involving people in other states?

19

MR. MILLER:

That is one of the many, many

20

cases that have come to this Court that are in

21

appearance multi-state class actions; but when one looks

22

at the facts of each and every one of those cases, each

23

and every one of them, one discovers that either there's

24

a clear satisfaction of minimum contacts or there is an

25

entity created by the forum, which decisions as far back
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

as Pennoyer and Neff make clear the forum can adjudicate

2

and make decisions about rights and liabilities, or

3

there's a fear that there will be conflicting judgments

4

resulting from sequential actions.

5

is either a res, an entity, a set of minimum contacts,

6

an organization created by the forum, or a very palpable

7

fear of conflicting judgments.

In other words, it

8

In this case you have nothing but

9

people with completely undifferentiated and

168,000

10

individualized damage claims, with no contacts, no

11

basis, no legitimate interest in the State of Illinois

12

to regulate, none whatsoever.

13

QUESTION:

What if these, instead of

14

inexpensive Cricket lighters we have $10,000 value

15

widgets, and the suit were brought in the district

16

court, federal district court in Illinois?

17

say that a class action could be maintained in the

18

federal district court?

19

20

HR. MILLER:

Would you

And we're assuming diversity of

citizenship jurisdiction.

21

QUESTION:

MR. MILLER:

Under the decisions of all of the

circuits, according to language in the Insurance

24

Corporation of Ireland case, the existing jurisprudence

25

under the Irian-Thompkins doctrine strongly suggests
18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that a state-city-university has no further

2

jurisdictional reach than the courts of the state in

3

which it's in.

4

Indeed, your reference to a $10,000 claim I

5

think very graphically shows what the threat to

6

federalism is in this case.

7

that a non-resident without contacts, without

8

acquiescence is free to litigate in his home forum

9

before a tribunal that is constituted by political

After all, the proposition

10

forces responsive to him, a tribunal that understands

11

the social fabric of the law it’s to be applying, a

12

tribunal that has a direct and substantial interest not

13

only in applying the law but applying it correctly, the

14

whole theory there is first the fairness to that

15

individual litigant, his right to claim the forum of his

16

state; and second, to make sure, as Justice White

17

remarked in the Woodson case, that the states recognize

18

that they are co-equal sovereigns in a federal system.

19

20

QUESTION:

But I take it your answer is the

federal district court wouldn't have jurisdiction either

21

22

MR. MILLERi

That is correct.

That is correct.

23

Let me just pursue the federalism point,

24

because I think it really is central to this case.

25

fears that one perceives of allowing Illinois to

The

1

collectivize 168,000 cases, even though they have not

2

been asserted by the individual holders of those claims,

3

is first there is a substantial risk, that this will

4

allow cases to be tried in the wrong place.

5

back to cases like Mullane and Ibbs, indeed all of the

6

cases cited in Respondent's brief, you have a forum with

7

a significant interest in the dispute because it created

8

the entity.

9

QUESTION:

If you go

Well, Mr. Miller, you used the word

10

"substantial risk" in the argument you just made, and I

11

suppose that conveys your idea that we can't foresee

12

exactly what would happen if an Illinois judgment

13

including claims on behalf of some plaintiffs from out

14

of state became final, and Gillette paid off on it, and

15

then another complaint was brought by someone who had

16

accepted the offer in another state.

17

Just as a matter of prudential jurisprudence

18

wouldn’t it make more sense for us in this rather

19

unknown area that you're talking about to wait until

20

that happens rather than to —

21

MR. MILLER:

With deference, Justice

22

Rehnquist, I think it's most prudential to maintain the

23

unbroken line of minimum contacts cases, because that

24

way and only that way are you likely to get states

25

respecting each other in terms of jurisdictional

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

acquisition.

And with great trepidation I suggest to

2

you that given the Court’s approach to state choice of

3

law, it is now only through the maintenance of the

4

jurisdiction principle under Shoe that this Court can

5

guard against questionable, indeed potentially abusive

6

applications of state law.

7

which you have no jurisdictional standing -- and that is

8

what the Respondent and the Supreme Court of Illinois

9

have decided -■=- in a situation in which you have no

Because in a situation in

10

jurisdictional standing, where Illinois can take

11

jurisdiction because it means well, then you have the

12 .spectre of cases being tried in the wrong fora, not the
13

fora where the contacts are significant, indeed

14

overpowering, like Ibbs and Mullane and Hansberry.

15

You also run the risk that that forum court

16

being subjected to the normal pressures of judicial

17

administration will have a great tendency to apply its

18

own law, thereby violating the individual’s

19

constitutional right to have his property, her property,

20

his claim, her claim adjudicated by a local forum under

21

local law by a local judge before a local jury, unless

22

that person manifests a willingness to accede to the

23

jurisdictional power of another state.

24
25

It seems to me that must mean — that must be
what this Court means when it persists in the notion

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Atkins.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. ATKINS, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9
10

11

MR. ATKINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please this Court:
I still believe, notwithstanding the remarks

12

of my learned colleague, that we live in one nation, and

13

we are one country, and we have many states.

14

compelled to say, however, that there was an air of

15

divisiveness that I gathered from Professor Miller's

16

remarks: and I think that if it was adopted, namely that

17

there be a reversal of the Illinois Supreme Court’s

18

decision, it would have a chilling effect on consumer

19

class actions which I think have been encouraged,

20

certainly as indicated in the Snyder case by this Court,

21

that it be tried in the state courts.

22

I feel

As a matter of fact, in the Snyder case it’s

23

very interesting.

It was a multi-district or

24

multi-state class.

25

people, 4,000 shareholders, and they lived in various

It involved state law.

And we had

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

parts of the United States.

And this Court said that

2

suits involving issues of state law are brought on the

3

basis of diversity of citizenship can often be most

4

appropriately tried 'in state court.
And I suggest particularly under those

5
6

circumstances and with the Court's statement in Standard

7

Oil in terms of class action being a viable mechanism

8

for the redress of these kind of grievances that with

9

the state directly at the present time, I respectfully

10

submit that the Supreme Court’s decision in the State of

11

Illinois should not be reversed.

12

be even addressed at this time; because I respectfully

13

submit that there are two very important reasons why the

14

decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois should not be

15

addressed.

In fact, it should not

And that is principally on the basis of

rightness for review and on the basis of standing.

with respect to the rightness argument, there's been no

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. ATKINS:

1

I think., Your Honor, that this

2

Court should dismiss the petition as improvidently

3

granted and leave the Illinois Trial Court to determine

4

this case, move on with this case, and have faith and

5

reliance in its state court, because I think that that's

6

where it belongs.

As a matter —

QUESTION:

7

Well, do you — do you suggest

8

there's not a final judgment or just that we should

9

dismiss it as improvidently granted?
MR. ATKINS:

10

I suggest that with respect to —

11

it may be a final judgment with respect to the issue

12

before the Illinois Supreme Court, but it doesn't

13

necessarily mean that it's right for review --

QUESTION:

15

MR. ATKINS:

Right, right.
— Of the issue that has been

16

raised.

17

issues, which as Justice Brandeis has indicated in

18

Ashwander, that the Court should be particularly

19

reluctant and show judicial restraint with respect to

20

getting into deciding constitutional issues.

21

issue before this Court raised by the Petitioner is

22

clearly a constitutional issue.

23

And the issue raised is the constitutional

And the

And it's very interesting in terms of the type

24

of case that we have here.

It's a class action.

25

Professor Miller has stated in one of his numerous

As

1

articles, he indicated that class actions, almost all of

2

them are settled.

3

settled, I submit that this may never raise its head

4

with respect to this piece of litigation because it may

5

be disposed of and disposed of appropriately in the

6

state court.

Well, if almost all class actions are

7

I suggest —

8

QUESTION;

9

Would settlement of this particular

class action by Gillette in the Illinois action really

10

solve Gillette’s problems, if Mr. Miller is right and

11

the problem is later suits in other jurisdictions?
MR. ATKINSi

12

I think it would, Judge, for this

13

reason.

I think that in my experience in class action

14

litigation, also in accordance with Rule 23 in the

15

statute of the State of Illinois, for any settlement —

18

we’ll say a settlement that is classwide — there will

17

be notice given in terms of the class members, and they

18

will have an opportunity certainly to opt out, as we

19

have in the class.

20

Supreme Court in terms of a judicial approval of a

21

settlement as being fair and adequate with respect to

22

the class, there will be no further exposure with

23

respect to those persons who didn't opt out.

If it is disposed of by the Illinois

24

Now, when we’re talking —

25

QUESTION:

Now, that just doesn't make any
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

sense at all to me, your answer.

2

who didn't opt out, if Mr. Miller is right, could well

3

have an action say in the State of Oregon where he lives

4

under Oregon law.

5

MR. ATKINS;

I would think anyone

That's correct.

That's correct.

6

The people who could file their own lawsuit in their own

7

state, that is correct.

8

classify that as an opt out.

9

think that they are still hanging there, and

And if they do, I would
In other words, I would

10

realistically speaking, Gillette would have to make an

11

accommodation with respect to those people.

12

But with respect to the 798 claims and in my

13

experience with respect to the small claim class

14

actions, that's really not realistic.

15

about a rightness, we're talking about — we're talking

16

about the possibility of conjecture and speculation and

17

possible future harm.

18

possibilities and I don't think these conjecture matters

19

should really get into the central core as to whether or

20

not this issue at this stage is right for review.

21

And we're talking

And I don't think these

Also because, as this Court knows, there's not

22

a firm factual background in terms of determining all

23

the issues in this situation.

24

not right for review at this time.

25

QUESTION;

And so I think that it is

Well, are you saying -- would your
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

position be different if the individual claims were say

2

$2,500 each instead of $7.95 each?

3

MR. ATKINS;

No.

Judge — Mr. Justice, the

4

position would be the same.

5

is a mechanism, a class mechanism that basically

6

disposes in federal court as well as state court these

7

matters through settlement in most of the cases, and

8

whether it’s — it still would be conjectural in terms

9

of someone coming in and filing their own action, and

10
11
12
13

The position is that there

whether it's in state court or federal court.
QUESTION;

But, Mr. Atkins, do you get to the

settlement posture till you know what the class is?
MR. ATKINS;

We get to'the settlement posture,

14

Judge, in my -- in my experience at the time that we do

15

notify, which sometimes is the same time.

16

QUESTION;

17

to certify a class.

18

MR. ATKINS;

19

QUESTION;

But before you notify, you've got

That's correct.
And then you send out a notice and

20

you know who opts out, and then you start talking

21

settlement.

22

MR. ATKINS;

23

QUESTION;

les, sir.
And I'm just wondering, you've got

24

an $8.10 claim here.

At least that’s -- as I understand

25

it, that's the maximum — you seem to admit that in your
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

brief
MR. ATKINS;

2
3

That’s -- that's pretty close,

Judge, right.
QUESTION;

4

And if that's true, I'm just

5

wondering how many mailings back, and forth you can

6

afford and have anything left.
MR. ATKINSs

7

As a practical matter, Your

8

Honor, you've put your finger on a situation where the

9

number in a class are important from an economical

10

viewpoint that was recognized in Standard Oil.

11

we're talking about a million four hundred thousand case

12

if our class is composed of everyone who didn't get

13

their lighters throughout the United States.
QUESTION;

14
15

And

And each one has a maximum recovery

of around $8.00.

16

MR. ATKINS;

17

QUESTION;

That’s right, Your Honor.
What’s the economic justification

18

for that kind of a lawsuit in the federal courts under

19

any circumstances?
MR. ATKINS;

20
21

We are in state court, Judge, in

this case.

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. ATKINS ;

In sta te or federal courts,
As f ar as judiciary concern, I

24

suppose th at if you — if y ou cheat people a little bit

25

but do it a lot that you ca n go by free.

The position

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

of the consumer fraud statutes and class actions in

2

particular, I think, Your Honor, is to provide a viable

3

mechanism for legal redress.

4

QUESTION*

Suppose you -- suppose you

5

prevailed on everything.

6

the members of the class will get more than $4 apiece or

7

thereabouts less all the postage?

8
9

MR. ATKINS;

Is there any likelihood that

We have figured that out, Judge,

and it’s something in the neighborhood of over $5.00.

10

QUESTION;

Five for each one of them.

11

MR. ATKINS;

12

QUESTION;

13

MR. ATKINS;

Yes, sir.
And the rest will be going where?
Well, if our class includes

14

everyone who does not opt out, then it would apply to

15

everyone with respect --

16

QUESTION;

Well, the rest of it's going to the

17

lawyers, is that not so, and to the expenses of

18

litigation?

19

MR. ATKINS;

There is administrative expenses

20

and there are judicial expenses that go into any class

21

action litigation.

22

has in fact deceived 180,000 people who were in our

23

class, then you're correct.

24
25

QUESTION:

And if we prevail and if Gillette

You say judicial expenses.

Are you

suggesting you have to pay the judges?
29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. ATKINS:

2

(Laughter.)

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ATKINS:

5

No.

I didn't mean that.

You mean attorneys' fees.
Yes.

I — I misspoke.

I

misspoke.
The other issue that is very important that

6
7

we’d like to address is the standing issue, because for

8

Gillette to come here — and I think that Professor

9

Miller has admitted today that he is asserting the

10

rights not of Gillette here, but he's basically

11

asserting the rights of the third party, absent class

12

members.

13

Wulff, the Court will try to determine whether or not

14

someone can come into this Court and assert the

15

constitutional rights of third parties, because — and

16

it's a very interesting and important observation --

17

that it may well be that these parties don't want to

18

assert these rights, and it may not necessarily even

19

come up.

And as indicated in the case of Singleton v.

In Justice Powell said in the Singleton case

20
21

in his dissent, that it must be a practical

22

impossibility for it to be raised for the Court to go

23

into.

24
25

QUESTION

When -- when there is a

communication with the potential members of the class is
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

there any obligation to tell them what is the maximum

2

recovery that they can possibly anticipate?
MR. ATKINS;

3

Normally in my experience you

4

indicate the parameters of the lawsuit or in the

5

settlement, what the terms of the settlement.

6

commonplace/ Your Honor, and that is what was done.
QUESTION;

7

That’s

Do you tell the individual who's

8

reading the letter that the maximum that you can expect

9

to get if you respond to this and join the class is

10

$4.83?

MR. ATKINS:

11

To be perfectly fair you would

12

come pretty close to trying to tell them that, because

13

the judge --

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. ATKINS;

-- Not tell them.
If I might say, because just as

16

was brought up before, lawyers’ expenses in the case,

17

administrative expenses may not wholly have been

18

determined at this juncture, so you can’t wholly note.

19

But you try to work out the parameters in terms of

20

letting people know what the expenses are and what he

21

could obtain or would obtain in connection with the

22

lawsuit.

23

QUESTION;

24

with a stamp on it?

25

MR. ATKINS:

Do you enclose a return envelope

It depends on whether there is
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

claims in the case or there are not claims in the case.
QUESTION*

2

Well, if you’re -- you’re

circulating a class of plaintiffs with an $8.00 claim do

4

you put in a return envelope or not?
MR. ATKINS*

5

9

In an opt out procedure probably

not .
QUESTION*

Well, it’s going to cost him a few

cents anyway to opt out.
MR. ATKINS*

That’s correct.

10

QUESTION;

Twenty cents.

11

QUESTION*

I said a few.

12

MR. ATKINS;

13

QUESTION*

F-e-w.

14

QUESTION*

May I also ask, does the notice

That’s correct.

15

customarily in Illinois class actions discuss whether or

16

not the class members, a) might be subjected to

17

discovery, and b) might have to pay some costs?

18

MR. ATKINS*

Well, one of the things that —

19

differences in terms of the class action that we have

20

pointed out is that costs are not normally assessed

21

against absent class members --

22

QUESTION;

But maybe they're not normally, but

23

can you say for certain that they would not be in a

24

particular case?

25

had the whole class certified, and then the case went

Say in this particular case here you

along for a while and you found out that the rule in Mew

2

York is a little different, and all the New York lawyer

3

-- all the New York purchasers lose because they

4

couldn't prove that they actually bought the material

5

instead of having it given to them or something like

6

that, who would pay for their mailings?
MR. ATKINS;

7

I think that you have again

8

addressed, Your Honor, a management problem, and whether

9

or not they even should be certified; because if there

10

are certain differences with respect to the laws of an

11

individual state, these are some of the problems that

12

may come up in a case that --

13

QUESTION;

But perhaps -- what I’m suggesting

14

is there may be differences that don't surface at the

15

outset.

16

that the laws are uniform, and then in a long case, and

17

sometimes cases go on for quite a while, there's a

18

decision comes out in New York that clarifies the law

19

there, and you find out there’s a little problem in New

20

York.

21

At the time of the certification it appears

MR. ATKINS;

The flexibility of a class action

22

device would be able to permit either a subclassing with

23

respect to that or even a carving out with respect to

24

that class.

25

QUESTION;

I understand that, but the reason I

mention those examples, what is the — in Illinois what

2

is the practice with respect to telling a person who has

3

a decision to make,

4

whether or not he might be subjected or costs and so

5

forth?

shall I opt out or not, as to

Is there anything -MR. ATKINS:

6

It's been my observation that he

7

is not told because the state of the law is such that he

8

does not have those expenses.
Now, if the law were something else, I suppose

9
10

-- that's not our case.
QUESTION:

11

Is it settled in Illinois that he

12

is not responsible for discovery and not responsible for

13

cost?
MR. ATKINS:

14
15
16

That's my understanding. Your

Honor.
It -- it -- in the — in the point — one more

17

point with respect to standing which I think is

18

important, and it sort of puts it in context? and that

19

is that the absent class members, whether they're in

20

Iowa, Michigan, California or Arizona — I mean if they

21

thought that Gillette, who as many of them may not know

22

had deceived them with respect to this promotion, was in

23

the United States Supreme Court and arguing that their

24

constitutional rights have been violated because of the

25

lawsuit that's been filed by a similar purchaser in the
34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

same position, I think that they would not support that

2

at all.

3

Gillette championing their rights.

4

important -- it's almost akin to the fox telling the

5

farmer that he would be a good protector of his

6

chickens.

7

that is one of the reasons that standing is important in

8

terms of bringing this to the Court's attention.

9

I don't think that they necessarily would want
I think that it's

I mean it's just not sincere.

And I think

I'd like to also address because I think it's

10

important the type of due process considerations going

11

beyond the standing of rightness issue which Mr. Miller

12

has addressed.

13

basically whether or not absent class members would

14

receive adequate due process, not merely on a

15

traditional static, ironclad kind of conception of

16

contacts which basically relate to defendants, because

QUESTION:

I understood Mr. Miller to concede

quite frankly that none of our cases had applied the

10

contacts rule to plaintiffs, but I would think that

11

maybe that's because up until now you have had real live

12

plaintiffs as opposed to class action plaintiffs, and

13

that if a real live plaintiff comes into a forum and

14

sues somebody, certainly he has waived any right he had

15

to challenge jurisdiction.

16

But here you have people who are associate on

17

the plaintiff's side of the complaint who have not

18

themselves made that choice.

19

ME. ATKINS:

I understand that, Your Honor,

20

that that particular issue with respect to absent class

21

22

23

there is great differences between defendants and absent

of a judgment, for example, on a defendant as

However, what

distinguished from what -- the most that can happen as

2

far as an absent class member is concerned is that he

3

has lost his opportunity if and when there may be

4

adjudication against him to contest that if he didn't

5

opt out.

6

QUESTION:

Well, he's also lost his right —

7

supposing he recovers the magnificent sum of $5.00 in

10

that says anyone who is imposed upon the way you say

11

Gillette imposed on these people shall have a right to

12

recover actual damages plus $1,000 punitive damages.
