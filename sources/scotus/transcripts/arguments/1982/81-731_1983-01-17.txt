ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT D. CABE,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. CABE;

8

9

Hr. Cabe,

ESQ.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
This case arises out of an attempt by the

10
11

Arkansas Public Service Commission to regulate the

12

wholesale sales of power and energy by Arkansas Electric

13

Cooperative Corporation to its member cooperatives.

14

This is an appeal from the decision of the Arkansas

15

Supreme Court, affirming the PSC’s assertion of

16

jurisdiction over these wholesale rates.

17

The facts of the case, while undisputed, are

18

most important to a determination of the issues before

19

the Court.

AECC’s member cooperatives sell the energy

3

they obtain to their customers, who are the ultimate

4

consumers of the power.

5

of the member cooperatives are fully regulated by the

6

PSC.

7

purposes other than regulation of wholesale rates.

8

The retail rates and operations

AECC is concededly subject to PSC jurisdiction for

AECC’s rates, including the ones at issue

9

before the Court in this case, are established by AECC's

10

board of directors which includes two representatives of

11

each of the 17 local distribution cooperatives who are

12

the members.

13

Succinctly stated, AECC arranges for the power

14

and energy necessary to supply the needs of its member

15

cooperatives in the following manner.

16

and operates generating plants.

17

with three separate multi-state systems to buy energy

18

when its facilities are insufficient to provide the

19

needs or when it could even buy the power and energy

20

more economically than it can generate it.

21

because AECC has very limited transmission facilities,

22

it arranges with these same three multi-state systems

23

for dispatch and transmission on the part of the grid

24

that is operated by each of these multi-state systems.

25

First, it owns

Second, it contracts

Pursuant to these arrangements, most of the

4

fact, only about 10 percent of the energy which AECC

5

sells to its member cooperatives is ever involved with

6

transmission facilities actually owned by AECC.

7

other 90 percent passes exclusively over the system or

8

grid of the multi-state utilities with which it does

9

business.

10

AECC's member cooperatives then obtain from the
In

The

All of the systems which transmit energy for

11

and sell energy to and buy energy from AECC have

12

generating facilities both in Arkansas and in other
\

13

states, and all of these generating facilities are tied

14

into integrated systems among themselves.

15

When energy is delivered by the grid to a

16

local distribution cooperative, the amount of the energy

17

can, of course, be metered and precisely measured.

18

However, the generating source of that energy may have

19

been at any plant attached to that grid whether inside

20

or outside Arkansas, whether belonging to AECC or

21

belonging to the generating facility of one of the other

22

multi-state systems.

23

The PSC in this case does not appear to

24

seriously dispute the proposition that AECC sales are

25

sales at wholesale in interstate commerce.

The

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

decisions in Attleboro and Colton make clear that the

2

state is prohibited by the Commerce Clause from

3

regulating sales at wholesale in interstate commerce.
QUESTION:

4

Mr. Cabe, it's your position that

5

that prohibition arises from the Commerce Clause itself,

6

I take it, and not from any other federal legislation.

7

MR. CABE:

That is correct. Your Honor.

8

QUESTION:

So you’re not arguing, then, that

9

the REA has preempted.
MR. CABE:

10

Our position has always been in

11

this case, Justice O’Connor, primarily based on the

12

proposition that the Commerce Clause, standing alone,

13

prohibits state assertion of jurisdiction over the rates

14

in question.
QUESTION:

You did write in the brief about

17

MR. CABE:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Did you raise that argument before

15

the Supreme Court in Arkansas?

20

MR. CABE:

Pardon me?

21

QUESTION:

Did you raise that preemption

22
23

argument in Arkansas?
MR. CABE:

Yes, that argument was raised in

24

the briefs filed with the PSC when the matter was

25

originally heard by the PSC at that stage of the

6

proceeding.

level of the Arkansas Supreme Court.

3

our Jurisdictional Statement in this case, we relied

4

exclusively on the Commerce Clause argument.

5

It was raised briefly in the briefs at the
When we submitted

However, before probable jurisdiction was

6

noted, the court invited the Solicitor General of the

7

United States to state the views of the United States,

8

and when the Solicitor General did so he employed a

9

preemption analysis in support of the argument.

For

10

that reason, we included the preemption argument, but it

11

is our position that the Commerce Clause standing alone

12

by itself prohibits state exercise of jurisdiction in

13

this situation.
QUESTION*

14

You don’t disagree, I take it, with

15

the normal rule that an amicus curiae can’t broaden the

16

issues in a case.

17

Solicitor General as amicus curiae raises an issue

18

doesn't mean that it's necessarily -- he's entitled to

19

do so.

That is, that the fact that the

course, the Court has within its discretion the

QUESTION*

2

I'm not sure we have jurisdiction

to reach the question.
MR. CABEs

3

As I say, in our view it is not

4

necessary to reach the preemption issue.

5

necessary to consider the Commerce Clause aspects of the

6

case.

7

QUESTIONS

It is only

You tried two or three times to say

8

what your idea was of what the supreme court said.

9

Would you tell me what you were going to say?

10

MR. CABEs

I was going to say, Justice

11

Marshall, that the supreme court specifically said that

12

the PSC was neither prohibited by the Commerce Clause

13

nor preempted by any federal enactment from exercising

14

jurisdiction in this case.

15

The line of cases which culminated with

16

Attleboro concluded with respect to the natural gas and

17

electric utility industry that the Commerce Clause

18

prohibited state regulation of the parts of those

19

businesses that were national in character but allowed,

20

in the absence of conflicting congressional enactment,

21

state regulation of the parts of the business that were

22

essentially local.

23

This division between what was essentially

24

local and what was of paramount national importance was

25

thus applied in the Attleboro line of cases to arrive at

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the rule that state regulation of wholesale sales in

2

interstate commerce was' not permissible, but states

3

could regulate sales at retail by local distributing

4

companies to ultimate consumers of the energy.

5

QUESTION;

Well, Attleboro wouldn't just

6

automatically apply to any wholesale sale; it would have

7

to be a wholesale sale in interstate commerce.

8

MR. CABE:

Exactly, Your Honor, that's correct.

9

QUESTION;

And if this generating facility

10

generated its own power and delivered it over its own

11

lines to local coops within the single state, I wouldn't

12

think — you wouldn't be here arguing that.

13

MR. CABE;

Absolutely not, Your Honor, and

14

that, in fact, of course, is the situation in Texas

15

where at least until recently, utilities there

16

generated, transmitted and delivered power strictly in

17

interstate commerce without interstate connection.

18

that's not the case here.

19

QUESTION;

But

What about the 10 percent that is

20

delivered directly to customers within the state from a

21

generating facility of the —

22

MR. CABE;

It's not delivered directly from

23

the generating facility; it passes over transmission

24

lines that AECC owns.

25

QUESTION:

I see.

2

After it has gone onto the grid,

then it might come —

3

QUESTION*

None of it is delivered directly.

4

SR. CABEs

Not by direct connection, no.

All

5

of those plants, all of those local distributing

6

cooperatives are tied to the grid, and that’s where they

7

obtain virtually all of the energy that they sell to

8

their customers.

9

QUESTIONS

I see.

10

MR. CABEs

Given the limited transmission

11

facilities that AEC owns — that AECC owns, and the

12

desirability of buying energy and selling energy to the

13

other interstate companies, AECC could not accomplish

14

its purposes without these complex arrangements with the

15

multi-state systems and grids, which involve energy

16

generated outside the state of Arkansas as well as

17

energy generated inside the state of Arkansas.
The Attleboro line of cases established an

18
19

admittedly mechanical test for determining the

20

limitation of state power and the area which must be

21

regulated, if at all, only through exercise of federal

22

power.

23

careful consideration of what was national importance as

24

opposed to what was essentially local and could be,

25

therefore, regulated by the states.

However, the court arrived at that test by

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

I don't feel that that test has been changed

2

or diminished in any way by later decisions of this

3

Court in any cases dealing with the gas or electric

4

utility industries.

5

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Cabe, didn't those cases

6

have, though, the fact that the Federal Power Act

7

adoption which did result in a preemption by Congress.

8

And what do you do with the Illinois Natural Gas Company

9

case which did recognize that there is a balancing line

10

of questions, as well as the so-called mechanical bright

11

line view, and in Illinois Gas declined to settle that

12

question.

13

And isn't that the question we have here?
MR. CABEs

In answer to your first question,

14

the Attleboro line of cases was decided before passage

15

of the Federal Power Act.

16

culminated the line, was decided in 1927 and that act

17

was not passed until 1935.

Attleboro itself, which

18

QUESTION;

Right.

19

MR. CABEs

So it was decided without reference

20
21

to any federal enactment.
Secondly, in the Illinois Natural Gas case,

22

the court said that it was not necessary to reach that

23

issue about whether the balancing type approach was

24

appropriate in view of those other cases, although those

25

cases did not involve decisions dealing with either the

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

natural gas or electric utility cases.
In our view, the court did balance, back in

2
3

the Attleboro line, when it determined what was

4

essentially local and what was national in character.

5

It did taka into consideration what was of such national

6

importance that the states could not reach it.
QUESTION*

7

So I take it you say there's still

8

a gap, then.

9

these rates aren't regulated at the national level, are

10

they?
ME. CABE*

11
12

There’s still an Attleboro gap because

Except to the extent that they are

regulated or controlled or supervised by REA, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION*

Yes, but not by the federal —

14

ME. CABEs

Not by the Federal Energy

15

Regulatory Commission.

16

agency.

They are not regulated by that

17

QUESTION*

So the Attleboro gap still exists.

18

MR. CABE*

Perhaps as to the cooperatives,

19

yes, sir, it does still exist.

20

the gap still exists.

21

While the test —

22

QUESTION*

23
24
25

If you ignore REA, then

Although Congress attempted to fill

it, didn't it?
MR. CABE*

In the Federal Power Act?

Yes,

Congress did fill the gap certainly with respect to

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

investor-owned utilities, but the FPC at that time in

2

the Dairyland decision in 1967 concluded that Congress

3

did not intend to include cooperatives within the

4

definition of public utility under the Federal Power

5

Act.

6

Circuit in the Salt River Project case.

7

And that result was concurred in by the D.C.

While the test has not been changed by any

8

later decision, the Attleboro line of cases test has not

9

been changed by any later decision, later decisions have

10

commented on the scope and breadth of the test.

In

11

United States versus Public Utilities Commission of

12

California, this Court illustrated the clear and

13

decisive nature of the test when it noted that

14

Attleboro left no power in the states to regulate sales

15

for resale in interstate commerce.

16

QUESTION*

And Congress thought Attleboro was

17

the law, I take it.

18

MR. CABE*

Absolutely.

19

QUESTION:

Whether it was right or wrong, they

20

seemed to adopt it.

21

MR. CABE:

Yes, sir.

Most clearly, the

22

comments in the congressional history seem to indicate

23

quite clearly that Congress assumed that Attleboro

24

prohibited all state regulation of sales at wholesale

25

and interstate commerce, and as indicated in the United

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

States versus Public Utilities Commission case and the

2

Colton case, this Court has affirmed that reading of the

3

Attleboro line of cases.

4

Also in the United States versus Public

5

Utilities Commission decision the court observed

6

the Natural Gas Act and the Federal Power Act

7

established limitations on the Federal Power Commission

8

which "were designed to coordinate precisely with those

9

constitutionally imposed on the states."

10

that

Now, this brings us to the Colton case which

11

concerned FPC jurisdiction over sales by Southern

12

California Edison Company entirely to customers located

13

in central and southern California, although the sales

14

in issue apparently included some very small portion of

15

energy which was generated outside the state of Arkansas.

16

Two of the holdings of that case are important

17

in our view.

First, in view of the Federal Power Act's

18

establishment of federal jurisdiction in precisely the

19

area which had been denied to the states, the holding

20

that Edison sales were sales at wholesale in interstate

21

commerce under FPC jurisdiction leads us to the

22

conclusion that AECC sales, also at wholesale in

23

interstate commerce, are beyond state power to regulate.

24

Second, we think it important that Colton

25

noted that the Attleboro line of cases and the test

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

established therein and adopted by Congress made

2

inappropriate a case-by-case analysis of the impact of

3

state regulation of sales at wholesale in interstate

4

commerce, but cut it cleanly and said that those sales

5

were entirely within federal power to regulate and

6

beyond state power to regulate.

7

QUESTION*

Mr. Cabe, suppose that Attleboro

8

and Colton were not on the books, had never been

9

decided.

Would you be here making the same argument?

10

MR. CABEs

Yes, sir, I would.

11

QUESTION*

And then resting, what, on Pike

12
13

against Bruce?
MR. CABE*

If you want to apply the Pike

14

versus Bruce Church analysis. Your Honor, we believe

15

that state regulation of these sales is still

16

inappropriate.

17

statute and command of law, a non-profit organization.

18

Its revenues must equal its expenditures.

19

AECC as an electric cooperative is, by

If the state of Arkansas, through regulating

20

the sales to the Arkansas local distribution

21

cooperatives, reduces the revenues which AECC obtains

22

from those sales, then AECC, to remain non-profit by

23

command of law, would then have to raise the prices

24

which it charges to these multi-state systems to and

25

with which it sells and exchanges energy.

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

So for that reason, it would be our conclusion

1

2

that even under a Pike versus Bruce Church analysis

3

there would be such an impact on interstate commerce, in

4

addition to all of the reasons stated in the Attleboro

5

line of cases that regulation of these sales should be

6

beyond state power, even if they have not already been

7

so held.

8

9

It is our position in this case that
Attleboro's recognition of the paramount national

10

importance of the regulation of sales of electricity at

11

wholesale in interstate commerce is even more

12

appropriate today than it was in 1927.

This is because

3

of the recent development of these vast, multi-state,

4

interconnected grids and pools which are designed to

5

provide power more reliably and more economically.

6

By utilizing both the facilities of these

7

interstate systems or grids and by utilizing energy

8

generated in several states including Arkansas, AECC

9

makes the necessary power and energy available to its

20

2

member cooperatives.
Attleboro, in our opinion, is still good

22

constitutional law, and regulation of these sales by the

23

state of Arkansas is beyond their constitutional power,

24

and for that reason, we think that the decision of the

25

Supreme Court of Arkansas should be reversed.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

2

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFF BROADWATER, ESQ.

3
4
5

6

Mr. Broadwater.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. BROADWATER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
AECC's argument that state regulation of its

7

rights is precluded by the Commerce Clause was heard and

8

rejected by the Arkansas Public Service Commission and

9

by a majority of the Arkansas Supreme Court.

10

Specifically, as you've heard AECC argue, that this

11

Court’s decision in Attleboro and the line of cases on

12

which the Attleboro court relied, precludes state

13

regulation of its sales to the retail cooperatives.

14

We disagree.

AECC has interpreted Attleboro

15

as barring state regulation of wholesale sales in

16

interstate commerce, and it is argued that its sales to

17

the retail cooperatives are such sales.

18

Now, although these sales are physically

19

intrastate, we agree that for purposes of determining

20

the scope of congressional power under the Commerce

21

Clause, these sales are in interstate commerce.

22

not, however, agree that Attleboro requires a reversal

23

of the result below.

24
25

We do

Factually, Attleboro is clearly distinct.
That case involved physically intrastate sales between

AECC has not really relied on the factual

similarities in the two cases, but it has relied on some

8

of the language and analysis in Attleboro and in the

Attleboro line of cases.

The Attleboro court I think

He says,

instances, state regulation of interstate commerce has

recited dozens of cases in which state regulation of a

variety of subjects — railroads, navigable waterways,

even though, he said, in each of these cases, regulation

involves a burden on interstate commerce.

I think a more recent case reflecting the

7

think anyone doubted it — that the states retained the

power to regulate retail rates.

9

In that case, the court said that retail rates

How, under the direct burden test, if retail

10

rates are in interstate commerce, the states can't

11

regulate them.
The fact that retail rates are now seen to be

12

in interstate commerce and yet, the state's power to

regulate them isn*t contested, I think is evidence of

15

how far the court has come from the direct burden

case cites an earlier case interpreting the Hatural Gas

21

Act, the Illinois Hatural Gas Company case.

22

those cases, the court says that two lines of cases

23

dealing with state power under the Commerce Clause

24

exist.

And in both

The Attleboro line and the more flexible line.
And the court says that — I think implicitly

in Colton and expressly in Illinois Natural Gas — that

2

it doesn’t have to choose -- that in those cases it

3

didn’t have to choose between the two lines of cases.

4

That when Congress passed the Natural Gas Act and when

5

it passed the Federal Power Act, it had Attleboro in

6

mind, and it was trying to remedy what it saw as the

7

jurisdictional back credit by Attleboro.

8

The court interpreted the Natural Gas Act and

9

the Federal Power Act accordingly to simply achieve the

10

intent of Congress, and Congress had Attleboro in mind

when it passed those statutes.

And something I

10*

would note just in passing — each one of the

cooperatives has the same representation on AECC's

I think this Court in recent cases has/

So I think under Pike versus Bruce Church,

alleged, I think, is the burden of having to participate

21

commission.

23

Well, that burden is no different than the

24

burden we're allowed to impose at the retail level, and

25

it’s no different than the burden that Congress has

What is the reason that these rates

MR. BROADWATERs

The Federal Power Act — the

jurisdiction over the rates, and the Federal Court of

MR. BROADWATER*

No, Your Honor.

And I think

2

it was that and also, we should remember that the

3

Federal Power Act was passed, I think, in 1935.

4

was passed in 1936, so when Congress passed the Federal

5

Power Act they didn't have really a clear idea of what

6

form the cooperatives were going to take.

7

The REA

And I think in part because of that, the

8

Federal Power Commission was hesitant to exert

9

jurisdiction over something that didn't really exist

10

when the Federal Power Commission was created.

11

wasn't the distinction between wholesale and retail

12

rates that was crucial.

13

But it

The purpose that the Commerce Clause is

14

designed to achieve is to, I think, promote free trade

15

among the states and to prevent economic warfare among

16

the states.

17

Pike versus Bruce Church would better accomplish that

18

purpose than a mechanical distinction between wholesale

19

and retail rights.

20

And I think that the more flexible test in

For example, imagine a generating cooperative

21

selling electricity — doing business in one state,

22

selling electricity to a small rural retail

23

cooperative.

24

selling large amounts of power to a multi-national

And imagine a large investor-owned utility

Which has the greater impact on

1

interstate commerce and on the national economy?

2

suggest the retail sale to the large manufacturing

3

company may really be of greater significance.

4

I

And I would also suggest that the abuses the

5

Commerce Clause was designed to prevent may be more

6

likely to occur in the case of the retail sales because

7

there, the state commission may be tempted to set that

8

industrial customer's rates very high so he can

9

subsidize other customer classes, and then they’ll

10

expect him to recover his added costs through sales in

11

other states or even in foreign countries.

12

The mechanical distinction between wholesale

13

and retail rates would have the Commerce Clause I think

14

ignore those kind of political and economic realities.

15

AECC in its brief argued the virtue of

16

self-regulation.

It was the opinion of the Arkansas

17

legislature that self-regulation was not the answer.

18

Twenty-five states have placed retail cooperatives under

19

the jurisdiction of state regulatory commissions.

20

AECC is one step farther removed from the ultimate

21

customer than are the retail cooperatives.

22

reason, I would suggest that the need for state

23

regulation in the case of AECC is even greater than the

24

need for state regulation in the case of the retail

25

cooperatives.

Yet,

And for that

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

And neither is REA regulation sufficient.

2

AECC admits that REA gives it considerable discretion in

3

setting its rates, and no real evidence has been

4

presented that REA examines, say, questions of rate

5

design.

6

that we consider rate design issues to be as important

7

as questions dealing with the level of rates.
I think the reason for the lack of scrutiny

8

9

Even though the commission noted in its brief

from REA is obvious.

There are over a thousand

10

cooperatives subject to the jurisdiction of the

11

administrator of the REA.

12

cooperatives seek rate increases annually, the

13

Administrator of the REA is reduced to reviewing one

14

rate case virtually every working day.

NR. BROADWATER;

17

That's right.

That's right.

18

And there's even very little statutory authority that

would, I think, justify their getting in the rate-making

20

business.

21

the administrator makes loans, he should certify that

22

reasonable adequate security exists.

23

all there is, I think, in the Act from which you can

24

infer any REA authority over the rates.

25

Section 904 of the REA provides that before

first administrator of the REA testified before a
congressional committee that he thought the setting of
rates was entirely a state matter, and that he didn't
have any jurisdiction over the setting of rates within a
single state.
Now, you might ask, did he have retail — only
retail rates in mind or was he thinking in terms of
wholesale rates.

I think it's very likely that the

testimony went to both wholesale and retail rates
because the original Act provided for the creation of
both wholesale and retail cooperatives.
So I think clearly, -QUESTIONS

Was this Administrator Cook that

you're referring to?
NR. BROADWATERs

Yes, sir.

So I think

clearly, if these rates are to be given any real
scrutiny, it's going to have to come from the state
level.
AECC has argued that there could be conflict
between state regulation and the REA.

Yet, 25 states

regulate the retail rates; a dozen states regulate
wholesale rates, and despite this extensive history,
AECC has not produced a single example of an actual
conflict between state regulation and the end regulation
