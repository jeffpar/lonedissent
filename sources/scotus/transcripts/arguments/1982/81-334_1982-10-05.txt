ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAKES P. WATSON, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. WATSONj

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court.
10
11

The question before the Court in this case is
whether allegations set forth in a complaint filed by

12 two regional labor organizations states a claim

13 relief under

Section 1 of the Sherman Act.

for

For

14 simplicity this morning I will refer to these two labor
15 organizations jointly as "the union."
16

The union alleges generally that it has been a

17 party for over 25 years to collective bargaining
18 agreements with defendant Associated
19 of California and its members.
20 association
21

General Contractors

I shall refer to the

this morning as "AGC," for short.

In paragraph 23 of its amended complaint the

22 union charges that AGC and

its members entered into a

23 conspiracy to undermine, weaken, and

destroy the

24 collective bargaining relationship between AGC and the
25 union by engaging in a

series of acts described in

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

paragraph 24 of the complaint.
The union also alleges in the second count of

2
3 its

complaint that the same acts constituted breaches of

4 the collective bargaining
5 and

agreements between the union

AGC.
AGC file! motions to dismiss and for summary

6

7 judgment in
8 ordered

the U.S. District Court.

The District Court

the antitrust claim dismissed, finding the

9 union's claim was essentially a labor dispute for which
10 the
11

union had remedies under its collective bargaining

agreement through arbitration and potentially through

12 the

NLRB.
In reversing the District Court, the Ninth

13

14 Circuit Court of Appeals focused on
15 forth in paragraph
16 Circuit

24 of the complaint, which the Ninth

felt stated the claim authorizing the District

17 Court to scrutinize
18 of the

two allegations set

Sherman Act.

19 subparagraphs
20

the activity of AGC under Section 1
Those allegations appear in

(3) and (4) of paragraph 24.

Paragraph 24(3) alleges that AGC and its

21 members encouraged and induced others not to sign a
22 collective bargaining agreement with the union.
23 Paragraph

24(4) alleges that AGC and its members

24 encouraged,

aided, and coerced persons who let

25 construction contracts to award

them to persons not

1 party to collective bargaining agreements with the union.
2

The Ninth Circuit found that these allegations

3 stated virtually the obverse of the situation treated by
4 the Court in Connell Construction Company v. Plumbers
5 and Steamfitters Local 100.
6

In the Connell case this Court held that an

7 agreeement between a union and a contractor with which
8 the union had no collective bargaining relationship was
9 subject potentially to scrutiny under the Sherman
10 Antitrust Act.
11

The Ninth Circuit apparently believed that the

12 Connell analysis would apply in this case.

We believe

13 the Ninth Circuit is mistaken in that regard.
14 believe Connell is a far different decision.

We
There are,

15 at a minimum, the following four distinctive features
16 about this case that did not exist in Connell:
17

First, here, unlike Connell, there is a

18 collective bargaining relationship between the union and
19 the defendants.

Labor remedies are available under that

20 collective bargaining agreement.
21

Second, in Connell, it was clear the union

22 could not claim a statutory labor exemption under the
23 Clayton and Norris-LaCuardia Acts because it was
24 combined with a nonlabor party; namely, Connell
25 Construction Company.

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

Under Allen Bradley it is clear the exemption

1

2 is forfeited when a union combines with a nonunion
3

party.

Here, by contrast, only unilateral activity on

4

the part of management is involved and alleged.
Third, in Connell it was clear that the union

5

6 had the power to shut any contractor out of the market
7

for bidding on jobs with Connell and any other similar

8

contractor that signed such an agreement with the union

9

simply by refusing to sign a collective bargaining

10

agreement with that company.

If there was no collective

11

bargaining agreement, then Connell, under the terms of

12

its agreement with the union, could not use that company

13

as a subcontractor.
Here there is no allegation that AGC has any

14
15

similar power to foreclose union companies from bidding

16

on the construction projects of letters of construction

17

contracts.

18

restraint of the type evident in Connell.

19

There is, therefore, no direct market

Finally, as this Court noted last term in

20

Wolfe and Romero, Connell appears to be a very limited

21

holding which applied an antitrust remedy in a situation

22 arising under Section 8(e)

of the Labor Management

23

Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 and its additions

24

to the National Labor Pelations Act.

25

Relying on the fact that the legislative

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

history of the Act, passed in 1959, indicated no

2 inclination on the part of Congress not to permit

3 application of the antitrust laws, the Court found
4 scrutiny of the conduct in Connell to be subject to
5 antitrust analysis.
6 pointing out in

However, the Court was clear in

that decision that the earlier labor

7 legislation, the Taft-Hartley Act, did contain
8 legislative statements indicating a desire not to apply

9 the antitrust laws to the broader proscriptions
10 contained

in those acts.

11

In this case, the solicitor general argues

12 that the allegations of paragraph

24(h) of the complaint

13 state the elements of a classic boycott in the antitrust
14 sense.
15

We believe this reasoning is faulty.
First, it seems apparent that the solicitor

16 general accepted the Ninth Circuit's characterization of
17 the complaint in this case.

And I feel impelled at this

18 point to detour just for a moment to comment on that
19 because the Ninth Circuit opinion contains some
20 statements about
21

what the complaint alleges which appear

to me to be at variance with the contents of the

22 complaint itself.

23

First, the Ninth Circuit twice states in its

24 opinion that AGC and its members attempted to coerce
25 letters of construction contracts to a ward such

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

contracts only to nonunion subcontractors.

2 such allegation in

the complaint.

There is no

The word "only’* does

3

not appear.

Nor could there truthfully be such an

4

allegation, since it would mean that AGC and its

5

unionized members were conspiring to shut themselves out

6

of the market entirely on construction contracts.
QUESTION*

7

Is the complaint in any of the

8 printed materials?

ME. WATSON*

9

10

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

It is in

the record.

11

QUESTION*

Pardon?

12

MR. WATSON*

It is in the record.

It is part

13

of the record transmitted to this Court by the Ninth

14

Circuit.

15

QUESTION*

But is it in the printed materials?

16

ME. WATSON*

Oh.

There is no printed appendix

17

here.

18

that since essentially it is --

19

We made a motion to the Court to dispense with

QUESTION*

It is in the appendix to the

20

petition for certiorari, is it?

21

MR. WATSON*

That is correct.

It is Appendix

22 E to the petition for certiorari.
23

QUESTION*

24

MR. WATSON*

25

All right.
The second matter in which we

believe the Ninth Circuit has inaccurately characterized

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

ths complaint is in asserting that the complaint claims

2 a boycott.

That word also does not appear in the

3 complaint.

But it appears three times in the Ninth

4 Circuit's opinion.
Finally, the Ninth Circuit asserts that there

5

6 is an effective lockout of union subcontractors being

7 carried out here by ASC and AGC is attempting to totally
8

shut out union subcontractors from work awarded by

9 certain letters of construction contracts.
10

allegation does not appear anywhere in the complaint.
QUESTION;

11
12

Again, that

From which part of the complaint

were you reading. Counsel?
tfR. WATSON;

13

The part I was reading from, Your

14 Honor, is paragraph 24, and particularly subparagraphs
15 (3), (4), and (5).

Those are the paragraphs that the

16 Ninth Circuit focused on.

They are in Appendix E to the

17 petition.
18

So we believe the solicitor general has

19 fundamentally erred in the way that it has characterized
20 the complaint.
21

Second, the mere fact that something

which is called a "boycott" might exist does not

22 automatically turn every situation in which such facts

23 exist into an antitrust claim.
24

At the end of last term, in NAACP v.

25 Claiborne, this Court found a noncommercial boycott not

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

be actionable under Mississippi law.

That concedely was

2

not a case which dealt with the Sherman Act.

Rather,

3 Mississippi's antitrust statute and common law theories
4 of interference with contractual relations were involved.
5
6

Nevertheless, the point seems clear.

It is

underscored by much earlier decision of this Court in

7 Hunt v. Crumboch, issued the same year as Allen Bradley,
8

1945, in which the Court, through Mr. Justice Black,

9 made it clear that labor disputes ordinarily are not the
10

subject of antitrust scrutiny.

11

union refused to permit anyone to join it, thereby

12

boycotting those people who worked for a certain

13 contractor.

In that case, the labor

Despite the fact that boycott analysis

14 would ordinarily apply to such allegations, the Court
15 refused to find a claim under the Sherman Act.
16

Recently, in an opinion which is referred to

17 with apparent approval by this Court in its Claiborne
18 decision, State of Missouri v.

National Organization of

19 Women, the Eight Circuit extensively analyzed the
20 legislative history of the Sherman
21

Act and concluded

that the commercial types of restraints at which the

22 Sherman Act was directed did not include political types

23 of activities.

We believe the same type of analysis

24 applies in this case, and it is exemplified, of course,
25 in the statutory exemptions contained in the Clayton and

6 respect,

7 well.

And with all

we believe this to be circular reasoning as

The test is not whether unionized subcontractors

8 receive contracts from

letters of construction

9 contracts, but whether they were at least considered for
10 them.

Moreover, the fact that a unionized contractor

11

12 may not get all contracts,

may only gat a portion of

13 them, certainly does not indicate that he is being
14 boycotted.

We also believe this Court's decisions in

15 Apex Hosiery v. Leader and Hunt v. Crumboch make it
16 clear that labor disputes are not ordinarily grist for
17 the antitrust mill.

And taking their lead from these

18 two decisions, many lower courts have followed that
19 reasoning in recent years.
20 the Prepmore case,

21

In the J.B. Stevens case,

and the Kennedy case, which are all

cited in our brief, follow essentially that line of

22 reasoning in

refusing to permit labor unions to assert

23 antitrust claims against employers and employers
24 associations who have acted antagonistically against
25 them, at least where there is a collective bargaining

relationship between them.

2

Now, the solicitor general seems to agree that

3

some unilateral employer conduct is exempt from scrutiny

4

under the antitrust laws.

5

is lost when third parties are affected.

6

out here that there are third parties in the form of

7

letters of construction contracts and unionized

8

contractors not members of AGC who might be affected by

9

ahy activity that the multi-employer association tak.es.

But he suggests the exemption
And he points

10

And we think there are three things wrong with this

analysisi
First, the labor exemption has been applied

the antitrust laws was a dispute between two unions,

17

where, in fact, the whole dispute was fought out on the

18

property of a third party, Anheuser-Busch.

19

The United States v. Hutcheson, the case

The Jacksonville Bulk Terminals, a case

20

decided by this Court last year, which was a protest

21

against Soviet foreign policy, obviously affected the

22 employer whose goods were not being loaded onto the
23
24
25

ships by the striking union.
In Apex Hosiery there was a violent sit-down
strike conducted by the union.

Many parties were

That is

for certain limited kinds of impermissible secondary

13 conduct.

If those remedies are inadequate, the

14 appropriate approach is to amend the labor laws, not to
15 try and pull off from some other branch of federal
16 regulation into the labor context.
17

Third, because of the two unique mechanisms

18 available in the construction industry, the issue of
19 just how much any unionized third party might be
20 affected here is very speculative.

21

This Court noted five years ago in the Higdon

22 decision that a pre-hire labor

agreement, which is

23 specifically authorized in the construction industry by
24 Section 8(f) of the National Labor Relations Act, is an
25 agreement which may be repudiated by a construction

13

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

contractor at any time before the union danonstratas

2 majority representation in the contractor’s work force.

That means that where there has been no such

3

4 demonstration,

any construction contractor signed to

5 such a pre-hire agreement can disavow the agreement and

6 not be bound by it from that moment on.

Second, as noted in the amicus brief of the

7

8 Chamber of Commerce, it is a common practice in this day
9 and aga,

and ona which in appropriate circumstances

10 passes legal muster

before the NLRB, for contractors to

11 create so-called double-breasted businesses;
12

that is,

businesses which may consist of a separate corporation

13 which

is union and a separate corporation which is

14 nonunion.

If the same ownership exists of the two

15 businesses,
16 regardless

economic benefit flows to the ultimate owner
of whether contracts are performed by the

17 union or nonunion business.
18

So it is not at all clear that a unionized

19 contractor is going

to be shut out of the market if an

20 owner or letter of construction contracts says,
21 this work performed nonanion.

Interestingly, respondent

22 admits this in his brief on page 49,
23 that one reason

where he states

the union should bring this action is

24 because contractors may

option of going double-breasted.

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

3y saying that, it seems to me the Respondent

1

2 has admitted there is a very real question here about
3

the way the Ninth Circuit approached this case.

The

4

Ninth Circuit said, we must have an antitrust claim here

5

because third parties are affected and the union can

6

recover its incidental damages.

7

reason we should be permitted to do that is because the

8

party against whom the antitrust consipiracy is aimed

9

may not be damaged at all.

The union says, one

We also believe this case is not properly

10
11

maintainable as an antitrust case because the result it

12

seeks is not consonant with the purpose of the antitrust

13

laws.

14

this Court held that antitrust laws are designed to

15

protect competition, not competitors.

16

In Brunswick Corporation v. Pueblo Bcwl-O-Mat

In this case the union seeks to collect

17

damages stemming from a decline in its power to

18

affectively represent carpenters occasioned by AGC’s

19

encouragement of the proliferation of open-shop

20

contracting.

21

the plaintiff wants nonunion competitors out of the

In other words, as in Pueblo Bowl-O-Hat,

22 market in order to preserve the market for unionized
23

businesses, unionized carpenters, and ultimately to the

24

benefit of the union itself.

25

Again as the amici have pointed out, there is

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

much to be said in terms of preserving competition for

2 permitting a market where both union and nonunion
3

contractors compete for construction contracts.
I will not take the time because of the

4
5

limitations of this argument to discuss the application

6 of the statutory labor exemption.

That point is briefed

7

in detail in both my brief and the brief of the

8

respondent.

9

there.

And the legislative history is set forth

I will note, however, that last term, in

10
11

Jacksonville Bulk Terminals this Court held again as it

12

has in the past that the term "labor dispute" as it is

13

used in the Norris-LaGuardia Act has a naturally broad

14

meaning and may apply to disputes where third parties

15

are involved and may even apply to disputes where

16

motives other than the economic motive are involved.

QUESTION;

Mr. Watson, your reasoning along

this line may be quite persuasive.

But is that not

something that ordinarily would be developed by

evidence, evidence of proximate cause?

evidence might be adduced pro and con as to how

Is it not

23

MR. WATSON;

I think Your Honor is correct in

24

the ordinary situation.

Certainly, attenuation is

25

something which can lead to factual questions that need

And that is why in the case I have taken the

2 position first that under Apex the Court ought to decide
3 whether there is an

antitrust case here at all.

Second, if the Court decides there is an

4

5 antitrust case,

then it should decide whether the

as to what evidence on proximate

this.

If I understand the Court's holding in Illinois

2 Brick, correctly, the holding amounts to a concern by
3

this Court over whether the expenses of litigation of

4

attenuated chains of proof are going to outweight any

5

possible benefit either to the litigants or the public.

6

And it seems to me that is the problem here.
That is why in cases such as this and

7

8 McCready, which was also a pleadings case, it seems to
9

me that if it is clear from the pleadings that the chain

10

of causation is hopelessly attenuated, that it is within

11

the Court's province to find that the party does not

12

possess the requisite either standing or be within that

13

other magical realm which is nonstanding, which is

14

referred to in Illinois Brick of persons who cannot

15

appropriately bring these actions.
QUESTION;

16

Mr. Watson, may I ask you a

17

question.

You suggest that the first issue we should

18

address is whether there is an antitrust violation and

19

postpone consideration of standing until we have

20

answered that question.

21

MR. WATSON;

22

QUESTION;

Yes.
Now, in your argument on the

23

antitrust violation, are you relying primarily on the

24

fact that the pleading is not sufficiently specific

But even if the complainant

7

excluded the words "boycott" in so many words, you would

8

still say that is not the kind of boycott which the

9

Sherman Act is —
MR. WATSON;

10

That is exactly right.

I would

11

still say that this is essentially a labor dispute and

12

that a multi-employer association and its members have

13

to have the power to formulate some type of unified

14

labor policy.

15

says, in so many words, that it shall not be an

16

enjoinable act to encourage or induce or suggest to

others that they not deal with a specific other party.

kinds, depending on which of the allegations in the

complaint one is focusing on

the union as a refusal to bargain under Section 8(a)(5)

2 of the National Labor Relations Act.
3

QUESTION:

In other words, they might single

4

out one employer and go after him on a refusal to

5

bargain because of the agreement he had made that was

6 postulated by Justice Stevens?
7

MR. WATSON:

That is right.

And there are

8 even broader remedies under the labor agreement itself.
9

As this Court knows from the Steel Workers Trilogy, when

10

you have a collective bargaining relationship, there is

11

an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealings.

12

And a unified action by the members of the

13

multi-employer bargaining unit to subvert that covenant

14

of good faith, I think, is clearly arbitrable, and

15

perhaps the subject of a 301 suit as well.

16

And there ace lower court cases that have held

17

as much, where a 301 suit has been brought and there is

18

no specific violation of any specific point in the labor

19

contract, but as in Lucas Flour, in reading the labor

20

contract, one can say, this employer has not really kept

21

good faith with the union.

22
23
24
25

So there are both contractual and board
remedies, we believe.

Thank you.

OS BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

1

MR. VAN BOURGs

2

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

3 please the Court.
4

I guess we have to start with the basic

5 premise of whether or not this an antitrust case or a
6

labor case.

That was addressed by the Court below.

It

7 treated the case as an antitrust case and not as a labor
8

case.

9
10

And the reason that it treated —
QUESTION:

I am not sure -- if I may interrupt

you —

11

MR. VAN EOURG:

12

QUESTION:

Surely.

-- would you agree with your friend

13 that if a hypothetical situation developed by Justice
14 Stevens were posed,

that one employer could be proceeded

15 against in the Labor Board?
16

MR. VAN BOURG:

No very readily. Your Honor.

17 My colleague said —
18

QUESTION:

I am not talking about the

19 difficulty of proof.
20
21

I am just talking about a

jurisdictional matter.
MR. VAN BOURG:

As an 8(a)(5), as an 8(a)(5),

22 assuming that the contractor has entered into a

23 collective bargaining relationship with the union and
24 then seeks to avoid the collective bargaining
25 relationship by developing a sham entity or a

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

double-breast, as we refer to it, and that we file a

2 charge under Section 8(a)(5)
3

to allege, in essence, an

attempt to run away from an agr eem ent, a runawa;y shop.
As a theoretical matt er, yes. that co'uld be

4
5

done on a contractor-by-contrac tor basi s.

6

practical matter, it simply is not done because the

7 board has said
8

Asa

that that is rea liy not a remedy for a

double-breast.
And in essence, if on e d eals with the reality

9
10

of the work place, what happens is that a contr;actor,

11

particularly when viewed in the co ntext of this Court's

12

decision in Higdon changes his nam e or its name for

13

every job, sometimes changes hi s n ame o r entity or styl'

14

of doing business on various se ctions of the same job

15

and joins an association, becom es signatory to the

16

contract, the day after the con tract is signed, moves

17 over to

the so-called open-shop division of that

18

association and becomes free of the collective

19

bargaining agreement because of the notion, specifically

20 discussed by
21

this Court in Conn ell, that there is a

statutory scheme that there sho uld be no top-down

22 organizing.
23

So even if we want to deal with the reality of

24

what this Court dealt with in C onnell, the answer, Your

25

Honor, to the question posed wa s that there is no

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

practical remedy under 8(a)(5)

That is why it is

2

essential that this Court understand the distinction

3 posed by the Court below in treating this as an
4 antitrust case and not as a labor case in my standing
5 hare before you and arguing this to be an antitrust case
6

and not a labor case when I would dearly love to argue

7 with you concerning the policy questions of Connell.
But for purposes of this case, it has to be

8

9 accepted and understood that we are dealing indeed with
10

the obserse of Connell.

This is not a labor case.

The

11

only way in which petitioner can prevail is to place

12

this case in the context of a labor case and have this

13 Court agree that it is a labor case and not an antitrust
14 case.
So let’s look at the two beacon lights which

15

this
s Co
Court focused in Connell.
16 thi

Number one, it said,

even
though counsel states that it is to be narrowly
n th
17 eve
construed
-- that is, Connell -- this Court states that
stru
18 con
there
re mmust be a stranger relationship.
19 the

Local 100 signed

agreement with Connell after putting economic
20 an agre
21

pre ssur on Connell at a time when it thought that it
pressure

protected by Section 8(e) of
22 was pro

the act in doing what

23 it did.
24

But assuming it was not, assuming the conduct

proscribed by Section 8(b)(4), regulated by
25 was pro

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Iaft-Hartley, subject to the filing of a charge under

2 Section 8(b)(4),

subject after a hearing before the

3

board to a collateral estoppal argument in a damage

4

action under Section 3, subject to a 303 action for what

5

it did, what Local 100 did, notwithstanding a regulatory-

6

statutory scheme, notwithstanding a statutory provision

7

that says that you can get damages for such conduct,

8

which is 8(b)(4), secondacy-boycott conduct,

9

notwithstanding the fact that after the passage of

10

Norris-LaSuardia, Congress gave United States District

11

Courts the authority under Section 10(1) for that same

12

conduct, to obtain an injunction against the proscribed

13

conduct, pendente lite.

14

So a full and comprehensive scheme of

15

regulation damages and injunctive relief, this Court

16

still held that even though it was clear-cut 8(b)(4),

17

10(1), 303 action, we shine the light on, the beacon on,

18

the fact that in addition to being proscribed by

19

Taft-Hartley, you Local 100 committed a violation of

20

antitrust, subjecting you to treble damages.

21

Standing was not even argued in that case.

22 was assumed.

It

And it was assumed because of a built-in

23

prejudice in the Kind of plaintiff we have;

if it is an

24

employer, the damages are assumed not to be speculative;

25

if it is a union, it is assumed to be speculative.

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

What was the second beacon light of this Court

2 in Connell?

It was, in fact, that tha action, the

3 conduct of Local 100 was designed to prohibit the
4 employment of nonunion contractors, which this Court
5 stated was exclusionary on a nondiscriminatory basis
6

and, therefore, anticompetitive, i.e., if you have two

7 nonunion contractors and one of them is efficient and
8

one of them is inefficient, and you exclude them both,

9 including the efficient one, this Court stated that that
10 nondiscriminate exclusion regardless of efficiency,
11

which incidentally was outside the record of that case,

12 constituted

13

the second beacon light.

QUESTION;

Do you feel this is kind of a

14 rehearing of the Connell case?
15

ME. VAN BOURG;

Absolutely not.

I stand here

16 arguing in support of the Ninth Circuit decision and,
17 therefore, in support of your decision in Connell, and
18 asking that reality focus on exactly the obverse.
19 do we have in this case?
20

21

What

We have a stranger

relationship.
The question was asked, and counsel stated

22 that all of

the parties are reachable under the National

23 Labor Relations Act.

That is absolutely not correct.

24 The owner of land, the major industrialist, the member
25 of the Roundtable who determines that there should be a

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

"union-free environment," says that when I build my

2 plant,

when I build my refinery, when I build my

3 chemical factory, you contractor will be nonunion and
4 you will see to it that you and your other contractors
5 who do work, on this project will be nonunion, and we
6

7
8

form a tripartite conspiracy.
A tripartite conspiracy to do what?

Again,

the Connell beacon light shines and finds what?

To

9 exclude on a nondiscriminate basis, regardless of
10 efficiency or nonefficiency,

all of those contractors

11 who have a union contract.
12

If you could find that it was an antitrust

13 case in Connell because of those two beacon lights,
14 stranger and nondiscriminate exclusion, you cannot avoid
15 the conclusion here, because without regard to whether
16 the contractor is the single lowest bidder, the single
17 most efficient contractor on the whole project, because
18 he has or it has a collective bargaining relationship
19 with the union, it is therefore excluded under what we
20 have alleged
21

in the complaint.

2QE3TI0ST:

22 entitled to assume,

Eut wouldn't these people be
at least for purposes of putting

23 together a policy, that generally your bids from union
24 contractors are going to be higher than your bids from
25 nonunion contractors, and therefore it is not a

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

nondiscriminate exclusion?
SR. VAN EOURGi

I do not think so.

Number

3

one, Your Honor, I think you would have to presume the

4

facts to be tried at a trial.

5

pleadings and the facts pleaded therefore have to be

6

assumed to be correct.

7

We are here on the

But quite the contrary happens everyday in the

8

real world; that is, that the union contractor,

9

precisely because he has highly skilled workers, they

10

are more efficient.

They may get a higher hourly wage

11

rate than a nonunion contractor, but he will do the job

12

cheaper and he will do it more efficently.

13

And day by day all over the country,

14

particularly in our area, the low bidder in the field of

15

contractors, union and nonunion, are union contractors.

16

So that assumption, in all due respect, Your Honor, is

17

not one that can be assumed as a matter of law, as a

18

matter of fact, or as a matter of reality.

19

Now, to continue with the aspect of why we

20

feel Connell requires a decision in our favor in this

21

case, and why the Ninth Circuit used Connell as the sole

22 basis of its decision, is that this Court did something
23
24
25

brand-new in a sense in Connell.
Previously — and this directly contradicts
petitioner's attempt to make it into a labor case —

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 previously,

at least since

1947, since the Taft-Hartley

2 Amendments,

the proviso requiring federal preemption,

3 which was decided by this Court in Garman, Guss and
4 Fairlong, and Garner, was specifically held to apply to
5 antitrust cases.
This Court's decision in Teamsters v. Oliver

6

7 dealt with the Ohio antitrust statute.
8

This Court held

that Taft-Hartley preempts any remedy, injunctive or by

9 way of damages in an antitrust action in that case.
10 Connell you

In

specifically dealt with that issue.

You referred to Oliver, as I recall, in the

11

12 text towards the end

of the decision and also in a

13 footnote, and stated, very simply, that it is true that
14 in the antitrust statute alleged in Connell, if we can
15 recall, that case was originally filed under the Texas
16 antitrust statute, was removed to the United States
17 District Court.
An amendment to the complaint stated a claim

18

19 under the Sherman Act.

This Court held that

20 Taft-Hartley preempts the field with
21

respect to the

state law, does not preempt with respect to the federal

22 law, and required this Court to balance the competing

23 interests between the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts
24 and the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as
25 amended .

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

And I specifically state it that way and

2 characterize it that way because the Connell conduct
3

would have been lawful and fully protected by Section 7

4

of the Waggoner Act, still Section 7 of the Labor

5

Management Relations Act because Section 8(b), declaring

6

the conduct of secondary boycott and indeed the type of

7

conduct as we had in Hutchinson a jurisdictional

8 dispute, was protected activity or at least not
9
10
11

prohibited until 1947; that is, the for the twelve-year
period between 1935 and 1947,
So we have a situation where this Court

12

decided in Connell that we will balance the competing

13

interests between the antitrust laws of the United

14

States and the labor laws of the United States.

15

therefore, it cannot be escaped that the reasonable

16

conclusion is here that if those competing interests are

17

to be balanced, both sides of the coin must receive the

18

equal balance.

19

And

If a union can be a defendant in a

20 treble-damage action in an antitrust setting and
21

context, and if you deny the relief the Ninth Circuit

22 gave to us in this case, you are saying, defendant you
23
24
25

shall be but never a plaintiff because you are a union.
Now, many such distinctions are made, and
throughout the decisions of this Court and the lower

QUESTION:

Hr. Van Bourg, suppose I agree with

3

you that a union nay be a plaintiff in the sense that it

has standing.

5

difference it might still be at the damages stage of the

6

proof of whether you can prove damage?

7

8

10
11

I suppose that I suppose that.

HR. VAN BOURG;

All right, now we get to the

standing issue-QUESTION :

Yes.

HR. VAN BOURG:

-- which I really feel is the

crux of the case.

12

QUESTION;

13

HR. VAN BOURG;

14

What

Yes.
Having overcome, if I can, for

purposes of argument, the antitrust portion --

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

16

HR. VAN BOURG:

-- the antitrust context of

17

the matter.

Again, counsel argues and the government

18

argues in their brief, the government says, statutory

19

exemption does not protect the petitioner, nonstatutory

20

exemption does not protect petitioner, the issue of the

21

labor laws preempting this particular subject matter

22 does not protect petitioner.
23

The government says, yes, they have stated a

24

cause of action and a claim for antitrust.

25

mischaracterize our pleadings.

They did

Then the government

35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

States, very simply, that the reason we do not have

2

standing is because the damages are speculative and

3

because they are remote.

4

petitioners argue very heavily that there are several

5

links in the chain between the direct proximate

6

causation and the damages.

7

And counsel and respondent —

Wy response, Your Honor, is to — again,

8

because when arguing statutes very often one forgets the

9

exact text -- Section 4 of the Clayton Act says any

10

person -- the union is a person — who shall be injured

11

in his business or property — I suppose we better

12

change that to "its or his or hers" -- by reason of

13

anything forbidden in the antitrust laws — we have

14

already gone over the bridge that this is an antitrust

15

case — may sue, therefore, in any District Court in

MR. VAN BOURGi

Your Honor, we have alleged

4 because remember, the AGC, and we allege in the

In

7 see to it that notwithstanding the existence of a
8 collective bargaining agreement, that those contractors
9 with collective bargaining agreements do not work
10 because its own membership has a significant nonunion
11 branch and can easily simply opt over.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES P. WATSON, ES2•#

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL
MR. WATSON:

13
14

Thank you.

Or really I should

say two things.

15

First, if I might just briefly, counsel had

16

indicated that there was no adequate remedy under the

17

labor laws for the kind of double-breasted problem that

18

occurs when a contractor opens an open shop and

19

maintains a union shop business at the same time.

In

20 fact, there is a whole string of NRLB cases on this
21

subject.

They are on pages 66 and 67 of the record

22 transmitte!

to this Court by the U.S. Court of Appeals,

23

cases such as Shultz Painting, which is at 202 NLRB No.

24

23; Milo Express at 212 NLRB No. 57, and so forth.

25

Second, in the time remaining let me comment

50
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

on Connell because it seems to me that the whole thrust

2 of the plaintiff’s c ontention here is that Connell

3 mandates this kind o f action.
4

First, as I pointed out in my opening

5 argument, there was a mechanism in Connell which is
6 absent here,

and tha t was the power of the union to

7 literally lock contr actors out of the market with
8 Connell and

any othe r stranger contractor it could get

9 to sign one of these agreements with it that they would
10 not
11
12

subcontract to a nyone not party to an agreement with

the union.
Here there is no allegation in the complaint,

13 no mechanism alleged that would lead to any inference
14 that AGC has such a power.
15

Second, the Court specifically emphasized in

16 Connell that it was engaging in a rather narrow
17 exception to the general rule about preemption by the
18 labor laws of antitrust claims.

Specifically, the Court

19 relied on the fact that when Section 8(E) was enacted in
20

1959 there was no legislative history to indicate that

21

Congress wanted 8(E)

violations not to be redressed

22 under the antitrust laws.

23

The Court made specific reference at that time

24 to the fact that the opposite was the case with regard
25 to the Taft-Hartl ey

Act.

How, it seems to me as

51
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

discussed in my opening argument Connell is clearly

2 distinguishable.

Finally, finally in Connell the Court says in

3
4

a footnote that where a party has two consistent

5

remedies under federal law, he may have a choice of

6

remedies.

7

considered whether the remedies were consistent or not,

3

it is clear here, I think, for the reasons set forth in

9

my brief by no stretch of the imagination are the

10

remedies consistent between arbitration grievance

11

processing, NLRB grievance processing -- both of which

12

are basically make whole type remedies -- and the type

13

of remedy which would be available in an antitrust

14

action where treble damages and attorneys' fees would

15

come down on the heads of all the losing defendants.

16

for those reasons I don’t think Connell creates

17

authority for this kind of action.

Now, whether the Court in fact in Connell
