CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Hr. Winkler, I think

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES T. WINKLER, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER, JIM McNEFF, INC.
MR. WINKLER;

6
7

the Court;
This case is before the Court pursuant to writ

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

of certiorari pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1254.

10

Respondents, the Operating Engineers Trust Fund, filed a

11

Complaint for fringe benefit collection pursuant to

12

Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act.
The District Court on cross motion for summary

13
14

judgment granted motion for summary judgment for

15

respondents.

16

affirmed.

17

this decision passed on the issue of the enforceability

18

of minority pre-hire agreeements and noted in its

19

decision the conflicting decisions of the various

20

circuits and that adopted what it called to be a middle

21

ground between the decisions of the Eighth and Tenth and

22

the -- on one hand which state that 301 actions are

23

different than unfair labor practice actions and the

24

conflicting opinion of the Fifth Circuit which adopted

25

the NRLB position that the minority pre-hire agreements

are unenforceable unless the union represents the

2

majority of the employees.

3

The Ninth Circuit adopted what it called a

4

middle ground, that there has to be a notice of

5

repudiation; until then minority agreements are fully

6

enforceable and that the issue of coercion in obtaining

7

the pre-hire agreements is not applicable until that

8

notice of repudiation.

9

Now, the department interpretation in this

10

case involves an interpretation of Section 8(f) of the

11

Act and this Court’s decision in Higdon.

12

involved an unfair labor practice matter, and therefore

13

it is important to try and figure out what effect an

14

unfair labor practice context will have in a Section 301

15

litigation.

Higdon

16

And in view of that, it is important to look

17

at this Court's decision in Howard Johnson, which said

18

that the basic policies in an unfair labor practice

19

context cannot be ignored in a Section 301 case.

20

In Howard Johnson it involved a Burns

21

successorship issue — excuse me, it involved an attempt

22

by a union to apply the contract of a predecessor to a

23

successor, and then Burns was not allowed in the Section

24

8(a)(5) context.

25

context in Howard Johnson, and this Court would not

allow that
Now, in order to understand the Board's

2

3

position in Section 8(a)(5), you have to go back to the

4

Board's position in R.J. Smith.

5

case of R.J. Smith was commented extensively by -- upon

6

extensively by this Court in Higdon.

7

involved an employer which had not complied with the

8

pre-hire agreement.

9

The Board's case -- the

In R.J. Smith it

According to the administrative law judge

10

before the Board, the administrative law judge said that

11

there's — noncompliance had been concealed from the

12

union.

13

And that's a very important point.
Despite this active nonconmpliance by the

14

union, the Board reviewed legislative history and

15

decided that because there was no majority status, that

16

the contract was unenforceable.

17

And it is important to note that it did review

18

legislative history and in the -- in its interpretation

19

of Section 8(f) of the Act.

20

certain provisions that — there are certain exceptions

21

in Section 8(f) that Congress intended to allow --

22

excuse me — Congress intended to allow for employers to

23

have a steady access of -- a steady supply of workmen

24

from the labor organization and to -- excuse me — the

25

provisions that Congress wanted to allow in enacting

It noted that there are

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Section 8(f), it wanted to allow employers to have two

2

benefits.
One was to give the employers an opportunity

3
4

to have workmen provided by the union.

5

employers often go from job site to job site in the

6

construction industry, they don't necessarily have their

7

stable complement of employees.
And secondly, pre-hire agreements would allow

8
9
10

Because

employers the opportunity to make bids based on a
predetermined cost.
Now, because of these two benefits, Congress

11
12

allowed pre-hire agreements to be not unlawful under

13

Section 8(a) and 8(b) of the National Labor Relations

14

Act.

15

itself showed the limits of its effect, and it noted the

16

proviso to Section 8(f) which stated that an election

17

may be called upon by any -- by anybody and it would not

18

despite the existence of the contract.

But the Board noted that the Section 8(f)

language

19

Now, normally, elections cannot be obtained

20

when there is an existence of a contract in the — in

21

any — excuse me -- in any other industry.

22

Now, it is very important to note that right

23

after noting this intent of the proviso, the Board then

24

stated that, and I quote, "Thus, the proviso constitutes

25

a statutory safeguard against just the sort of

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

irresponsibly imposed minority union representation

2

which this record reveals."

3
4
5

That's a very important quote.

I didn't put

that in my brief or the reply brief.
The Board then went on and said, because you

6

can file an election petition, it would be inconsistent

7

with this purpose to not allow an examination of

8

majority status in the litigation of refusal to bargain

9

in cases where the employer is refusing to comply with

10
11

the agreement.
So the old issue in R.J. Smith was the

12

retroactive application — was the retroactive

13

enforcement of a collective bargaining agreement, the

14

pre-hire agreement.

15

counsel of the Board argued that you couldn't look, back

16

beyond 6 months, the statute 10(b),

17

limitations, because of this Court's decision in Bryant

18

and the usual presumption of majority status that it can

19

only — usual presumption of majority status in

20

collective bargaining agreement can only be attacked

21

within the last 6 months by filing a charge with the

22

Labor Board showing that it was obtained unlawfully

23

because it was a minority union.

24
25

As a matter of fact, the general

statute of

But the Board said that doesn’t matter here,
because it's not unlawful to enter into an 8(f)

agreement.

2

months and look back, way back to the beginning of the

3

agreement to find out when it was, what kind of an

4

agreement it was, and whether or not there is a majority

5

status to support it.

Therefore, we can go back beyond the 6

So the entire purpose of the R.J. Smith

6

7

decision was to look back and see whether or not it

8

could be retroactively applied.

9

Now, as I pointed out in my brief, the D.C.

10

Circuit denied enforcement and adopted the theory that

11

respondents argue in their brief that you have to

12

actually file for a petition for an election and until

13

that point in time the contract is enforceable.

14

The Board did not take the petition for

15

certiorari at that time.

16

case.

17

sort of reached the issue in the backdoor manner.

18

Higdon was an 8(b)(7)(c) matter involving unlawful

19

picketing for recognition.

20

It waited until the Higdon

And it’s important to note in the Higdon case it

And it's important to note that the issue of

21

minority status is not at all involved in the issues,

22

the basic element to an 8(b)(c)

23

violation is made up of basically picketing for an

24

unreasonable period of time not to exceed 30 days where

25

the object is recognitional and there has been no

violation.

An 8(b)(c)

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

petition filed for an election with the National Labor

2

Relations Board.

3

That has nothing to do with the minority

4

status of a union.

5

an affirmative defense if the Board has said that the

6

literal terms of 8(b)(7)(c) do not apply in a situation

7

where the union is not seeking initial recognition.

8

other words, if it already has a contract or a

9

bargaining history, then it can — then it can picket

10
11

The issue only comes into effect in

for recognition beyond 30 days.
However, the Board said that they will not

12

allow that affirmative defense where the recognition is

13

not based on majority status.

14

majority versus minority status was joined in that case.

15

And the Board relied on its R.J. Smith decisions and its

16

decisions under section 8(a)(5) of the act.

17

D.C. Circuit again reversed, and that’s how it came

18

before this Court.

19

Therefore, the issue of

And the

And as is shown by the petition and briefs to

20

the Court by the Board, this Court passed not only on

21

the 8(b)(7) issue but it, in order to reach that issue,

22

it had to go back and pass on the Board's position in

23

Section 8(a)(5), and it commented on the Board's

24

decision in R.J. Smith.

25

passed favorably upon the Board's decision that minority

And it also commented on and

pre-hire agreements are not enforceable unless the union

2

obtains majority support.
Now, the Board rule is basically that, when a

3
4

union obtains majority, the pre-hire agreement is

5

enforceable.

6

look both at the R.J. Smith decision and also look to

7

the Board's brief to find out the reasons for its

policy.

9

statute — excuse me, it limits the adaptation of the

10
11

Until then it is not.

And you have to

Basically, it limits the purposes of the

statute to its purposes.
In other words, once an employer obtains union

12

members from the union hiring hall, the skilled pool of

13

employees, then the union will normally obtain majority

14

status, and the agreement is therefore enforceable.

15

situations where they do not obtain that — do not use

16

that pool and the union does not obtain majority status,

17

then the agreement is not enforceable.

18

In

Now, it is very important to look at the basic

19

reasons behind the Board's decision.

20

Board has said that the voluntary compliance of Section

21

8(f) agreements, of minority Section 8(f) agreements, is

22

not itself unlawful and has said it's all right.

23

This Court and the

Now, the reasons for that is not that the

24

voluntary compliance of the pre-hire agreement is itself

25

good for employees.

It is important to note that the

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

voluntary compliance of minority pre-hire agreements is

2

in itself inconsistent with employee rights.

3

because of this accommodation to the particular needs of

4

the construction industry that it has allowed this

5

exception.

6

that the record revealed an irresponsibly imposed

7

minority representation.

10

And that is why the Board said in R.J. Smith

Now, you might wonder why did the Board say

8

9

It's just

that when there is no specific findings that any
employee was disadvantaged by that.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Winkler, I think in your briefs

Are you going to treat it in your oral

May I just ask one question here?
Yes, sir.

If I understand you correctly, the

enforceabilty of the agreement depends on whether or not

there was in fact a majority status.

2

HR. WINKLER;

3

QUESTIONS

That is correct.

And when, in your view, is it

4

appropriate for that determination to be made?

5

your view that the employer can just wait until the

6

union sues to, in this case, to collect the pension

7

obligations, just wait until they sue and then you have

8

a trial of whether there is majority status?

9

MR. WINKLERs

10

Board's position, yes.

11

QUESTION;

That is correct.

Is it

Under the

Would you say that if the — if the

12

company had in fact made the payments and then realized

13

that the union never acquired majority status, that it

14

could sue for a refund?

15

HR. WINKLERs

I don’t believe so.

Just

16

because the Board and the courts say that voluntary

17

compliance is all right.

18

violated any law and they have complied.

19

has also said they can unilaterally make changes.

20

can apply some and not to others.

21

Smith for a certain period of time it did make payments

22

in the trust fund on a few of the union employees, but

23

those employees were still the minority.

In other words, they haven't

employer could pay below the union scale as long as

10

nobody complained about it and then later on the

11

employees might say, well, you signed the pre-hire

12

agreement which — well, in this case I take it there

13

was an undertaking to pay according to the union scale.

view?

detriment because of court enforcement and Board

Also, in the Ruttmann decision, which was a

please the Courts

6

Just a few more points I would like to make.

7

I keep on referring to the Board’s R.J. Smith decision

8

because it is the basis of the Board’s policy and it

9

sets out the Board's policy in total.

It is very

10

important to note that not only did respondent not rely

11

on Section 8(a)(5) cases in its brief, it did not even

12

cite in its entire brief the R.J. Smith decision.

completely avoiding the Board’s position on these

14

matters.

15

It is

Now, this Court in Higdon also pointed out the

very issue of the enforceability of minority agreements

in 301 litigation which was raised in the AFL-CIO brief

2

MB. WINKLER;

I disagree.

I don't see how it

3

can be, because the — okay — they went in the R.J.

4

Smith decision, they went all the way back and found

5

that there was no enforceable agreement, and also they

6

--it was not -- excuse me, there is no notice of

7

repudiation in R.J. Smith.
The government distinction is very simple.

8

9

It

simply says that that was an unfair labor practice

10

proceeding and this is a 301 litigation.

And that I

11

think was discussed and resolved in the Higdon decision

12

itself.

labor practice case should not be — should also be

controlling in a 301 case.

19

are completely separate.

20

at my reply brief, you will see that the entire history

21

from Lincoln Mill and Howard Johnson on up to Higdon

22

itself says you just cannot ignore the basic policies in

unfair labor practice context.

Now the litmus test to be applied here is the

Mr. Winkler, 306(a), the language

there is collectively bargained agreement.

there a difference between a collectively bargained

agreement and a collective bargaining agreement?

5

MR. WINKLER:

Now, is

I notice the distinction in the

language there.

7

talking about there.

8

this Court was careful to use the term "pre-hire

9

agreement" —

10

I don't know exactly what they're

QUESTION;

I notice in — in Higdon itself,

Well, clearly enough, a pre-hire

11

agreement is not yet a collective bargaining agreement.

MR. WINKLER;

MR. WINKLER:

Oh,

I would say not.

Why not?
The idea of collectively —

Why not?
— collectively bargained

assumes that the QUESTION:

Well, if they sat down and

bargained, even though it was a minority pre-hire

agreement, isn't that —

MR. WINKLER;

24
25

That'd be —

-- collectively bargained even if

it's not a collective bargaining agreement?
MR. WINKLER:

The idea of collective

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

bargaining assumes the idea that they're acting as the

agent of the employees, as the collective bargaining

3

agent for those employees.

4

QUESTION;

Well, do you think Congressmen —

5

Congress chose that language, “collectively bargained

6

agreement," purposely to indicate maybe a distinction?

7

MR. WINKLER;

I do not believe that they did.

8

I notice in the original Senate version they also had

9

the words “collectively bargained."

I believe they also

10

said — made a reference to a "collective bargain

agreement" in 308(a).

13

And that's pointed out in my

But I would note that the Sorrenson decision

14

has some practical effect in the Board’s DeAngelo and

15

Kahn decision, which is also cited in my reply brief.

16

The only issue in DeAngelo and Kahn are really the trust

fund payments.

18

the agreeement on one job site, but then on another job

19

site it gave what it would have been the trust fund

20

payments, it gave that extra amount to the employees in

23

had to pay a certain amount, and that amount was the

24

same as the overall union contract.

25

The employer voluntarily complied with

It was a federally funded

So the employees actually got a greater

I know that is your — that is your

would, in effect, give notice.

that did not occur here.

MR. JETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioner McNeff has argued from the

21

viewpoint that because a breach of a Section 8(f)

22

agreement before majority status is achieved is not a

23

violation of Section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor

24

Relations Act, that that breach then cannot be remedied

25

by a suit brought under Section 301.

26

1

However, we have shown in our briefs that

2

Section 8(a)(5) cases and all unfair labor practice

3

cases are government litigation pursued by the

4

government at government expense to enforce rights and

5

duties that are created by statute under the Act.

6

By comparison, private rights and duties that

7

are created by private agreement have been left to

8

enforcement according to the normal processes of the

9

courts under Section 301 litigation.

10

That is a tandem system of handling labor

11

disputes that has served the country well since 1947

12

when Section 301 was enacted.

13

There is no reversal involved of any Section

14

15

judicial action.

16

Well, Your Honor, as far as an

unfair labor practice involved in a 301 case in the

And the Ninth Circuit clearly came down in a

it had not been officially reported as yet at the time

of our brief, but we cited it, and it has been, of

16

analysis essentially that we did in analyzing the

references to litigation of majority status in Iron

You don't think that's a Board

MR. JETT:

Your Honor, it is to the extent

14

tha t it represents the government's views.

However, I

15

m us t note that, as the Court has already mentioned, that

QUESTIONS

When is he not subject to suit in

the 301 action?
ME. JETT:

The agreement, according to our

4

argument, is that he would not be bound to the agreement

5

after the Board certifies a union election result that

6

the union has lost.

That is exactly the same treatment

QUESTION:

So the employer, before he can get

11
12

out of the agreement, he has to -- he has to precipitate
a representation election?
MR. JETT;

An election has to be precipitated,

we'll put it that way.

13

QUESTION;

And he has to win?

14

MR. JETT:

The employer may do it.

As the

15

Iron Workers decision says, when this Court referred to

16

the fact that the agreement was voidable, the precise

17

means and the only means that this Court referred to was

18

the filing of a petition under the proviso.

19

filing of a petition, as we have shown in our brief,

20

keeps all employee representation issues — the

21

determination of appropriate bargaining unit, the

22

determination of eligibility of voters -- all of those

23

aspects are kept before the Board.

24
25

QUESTION:

So it changes the burden, the

pre-hire changes the burden with respect — it changes

MR. JETTi

Your Honor, it does not.

MR. JETT:

What it would force him to do

2

require him to do is to do what he agreed to do; that

3

is, perform according to the agreement until there is an

4

expression of self-determination by the employees in

5

which they vote out the union.

MR. JETT:

So you — so you do say that

to this extent:

Yes, Your Honor, it does.

It does

As this Court recognized in Iron

10

Workers, 8(f) specifically was intended as an exception

11

to the general requirement of the law that there be

12

majority status before a contract can be signed.
And let me, if I might, look, specifically at

13
14

the objectives of Congress when they enacted Section

15

8(f).

16

can be identified.

17

in the construction industry needed the ability to sign

18

binding contracts that would establish firmly their wage

19

rates that could then be used by them in preparing bids

20

that would be entered into competitive bidding for

21

construction projects.

I believe there are four clear objectives that
The first one is that the employers

When those bids are accepted, the employer is

22
23

bound contractually to perform by them, and he needs

24

reliable labor costs.

25

risk .

Otherwise, he is substantially at

1

Secondly, to the same extent, it is very

2

common in the construction industry that time is of the

3

essence in performing a construction contract once he

4

gets the winning bid.

5

source of labor that he can call on immediately in order

6

to perform the contract.

7

way construction projects develop and bids are won, the

8

employer normally cannot afford to keep a full staff of

9

workmen on his staff and on his payroll.

Therefore, he needs a ready

It's not common at all for the

10

source of workmen.

11

contractually reliable basis.

12

He must have a

And he needs that on a reliable, a

How, from the union standpoint, there were

13

also two objectives.

The unions needed to have some

14

approach to stabilize working conditions in their

15

geographic areas over a period of years.

16

legislative history clearly recognizes that they had

17

been doing that by the practices of signing agreements

18

applicable to geographic areas over 1, 2, or 3 years.

And the

19

I would cite the legislative history, since it

20

has been questioned in the reply brief, pages 423 to 25,

21

pages 451 and 52, page 759 and 777.

22

Clearly, it was the intent of Congress to

23

validate the practice of signing binding contracts that

24

would stabilize working conditions within an area so

25

that the union and the employer would not have to bid on

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

a project or to bargain on a project-by-project basis

2

after the employees got out on the site where there

3

could be disruption of work at the job site.

4

And fourth, the fourth objective is also a

5

union objective.

6

the high mobility and the short — shortness of jobs in

7

the construction industry, that the construction unions

8

did need certain organizing mechanisms that were out of

9

the ordinary for other industries.

Congress recognized that because of

One of those, they

10

recognized that the unions needed an exclusive hiring

11

hall to refer their workmen out, and they also

12

recognized a need for the 7-day union security clause.

13

Both of those objectives, both of those mechanisms are

14

expressed precisely in the wording of Section 8(f).

15

Now, I refer to those objectives in some

16

detail because they must be examined to recognize that

17

every one of those four objectives of Congress requires

18

a binding contract in order to achieve it.

19

looked at the existing law at that time and said that,

20

well, they've got to have a binding contract in order to

21

achieve those objectives; right now they have to show

22

majority status before they can sign that.

23

Congress

Now, if they were — if we were to follow that

24

approach, we would have to be ready for the NLEB to

25

conduct elections and every bargaining unit from the

history says at several places it's not feasible in the

3

construction industry to contemplate having elections in

4

every unit in order to certify the union as the

5

bargaining agent.

find clearly, the legislative

They said, therefore, because of that, the

6

\

7

unfeasibility of elections in every unit and because we

8

need these four objectives under the circumstances of

9

the construction industry to be met, we are authorizing

10

the pre-hire agreement, we are validating the practices

11

that have been used by the unions, and we are doing it

12

by enacting Section 8(f).
QUESTIONS

13

Well, you would force the — you

14

would force the employer before the Board in any case

15

where he seriously doubted the — the majority status of

16

the union.

17

MB. JETT;

Your Honor, in order to present a

18

question of employee representation, it is all -- has

19

always been the requirement that that question of

20

representation be presented to the Board.

21

replete that the Board is the administrative tribunal

22

that has the expertise to make that decision.

23

The cases are

And let me say this about the prospect of a

24

transfer wholesale of the employee representation issues

25

in the construction industry from the Board, where it's

38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

been for the last 25 years, into the courts.

2

simply do not have the capacity to continue absorbing

3

the additional doses of litigation that they’re

4

getting.

5

And under such a ruling, under 301 cases, both the state

6

and the federal courts would then be involved in

7

litigating majority status issues.

The litigation arena is too crowded already.

It's doubly troublesome to contemplate moving

8

9

The courts

employee representation issues from the Board to the

10

courts for this reason.

11

burden on the courts would indicate that legislatively

12

those burdens should be moved from the courts to

13

administrative tribunals.

14

thousands and thousands of employee representation

15

issues.

agreement would be litigated in the courts rather than

17

the Board.

18

If anything, the litigation

And yet we would have

QUESTIONi

Well, Hr. Jett, even if we affirm

19

the Ninth Circuit here, it would have the effect of

20

moving a lot to the courts, wouldn’t it, unless your

21

view were adopted in the process?

22

HR. JETTi

Your Honor, that is correct.

To

23

adopt the Ninth Circuit’s view, it would result in

24

moving majority status to the courts.

25

in dictum views because even under the Ninth Circuit’s

That was stated

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

view holding for us, there was no repudiation here

2

that is why we are pointing out it’s so — it's such an

3

important aspect of this case that the proper legal

4

structure for deciding the case is set, because if it is

5

— if courts are led to believe that those issues of

6

majority status of an appropriate bargaining unit, all

7

of those things that go into determining majority

8

status, it’s by no means just a situation of checking

9

the payroll and determining who is a union member.
QUESTION;

10

But

How do you respond to Mr. Winkler's

11

position, though, that the Board itself has viewed these

12

agreements as unenforceable?
MR. JETT;

13

Your Honor, they -- the Board has

14

not reviewed -- viewed them as unenforceable under 301.

15

The Board has never decided that issue.

16

called upon.

It wouldn’t be

That's what's before this Court.

It is unenforceable from the standpoint that

17
18

the government will not pursue litigation at government

19

expense under Section 8(a)(5) to enforce that

20

agreement.

21

as a matter of fact, I would like to point out in regard

22

to the ERISA Amendment that basically the same

23

government attitude toward the enforcement of these

24

private rights is maintained in ERISA, because while the

25

ERISA Amendment creates the statutory right or

So that — that would stand completely. And

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

obligation to perform the contract, there is also a part

2

of that amendment that says the Secretary of Labor will

3

not initiate litigation to enforce that contract.

4

And so basically, it is simply a situation

5

that the Board has said and ERISA has said that the

6

government is not going to expend its agency resources

7

to enforce this as a matter of public policy.

8

under the ERISA Amendment, they did add the provision

9

that entitles the private trustees to recover their

10
11

However,

costs of pursuing that litigation.
So in that respect of what the ERISA Amendment

12

did is simply add the statutory obligation that 8(a)(5)

13

doesn’t provide for performance here, it adds the

14

statutory obligation but again it leaves the litigation

15

in private hands just as it was under 301.

16

QUESTION i

Incidentally, what do you suggest

17

is the reason that that ERISA Amendment speaks for the

18

collectively bargained agreement rather than a

19

collective bargaining agreement?

20

MR. JETTi

Your Honor, I believe that it is

21

common usage in ERISA to speak in that terminology as

22

opposed to collective bargaining agreement.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

It --

In other words, this is a different

thing than a collective bargaining agreement?
MR. JETT:

I believe that ERISA, while it

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

intended collectively bargained agreement to apply

2

broadly to these kinds of agreements, I believe they

3

were not concerning themselves with the intricacies of

4

unfair labor practice law in terms of recognizing the

5

policies of the Board in any detail.

6

at the very minimum what has to be said about the

7

legislative history of the ERISA Amendment is that with

8

the citation of the Overhead Door case that expressed

9

disapproval of Overhead Door and McDowell, both of them

But I believe that

10

being clearly 8(f) cases in which majority status was

11

raised, the minimum that can be said is that Congress

12

intended that that statutory obligation in Section 515

13

applies to 8(f) agreements.

14

agreements --

15
16
17

QUESTIONS

They viewed those

That they may be collectively

bargained even if not collective bargaining agreements?
MR. JETT;

Correct, Your Honor, although I

18

would say this.

I don't believe the history of Section

19

8(f) indicates that a pre-hire agreement is not a

20

collective bargaining agreement.

21

decision of this Court in Iron Workers was -- was

22

specific and express in saying that — that the

23

collective bargaining agreement does not move to the

24

status of a Section 9 representative which would entitle

25

it to enforcement under Section 8(a)(5).

I believe that the

But it didn't

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

say that — that this is not a collective bargaining

2

agreement.

3

bargaining agreement.

4

conditions for employees on whose behalf the union

5

bargained.

In my estimation, clearly it's a collective

QUESTION;

6

It sets wages and working

Isn't one of the requirements for a

7

collective bargaining agreement that the union has to

8

represent the employees?

9

MR. JETT;

Your Honor, it is, except in 8(f)

10

cases.

And what Congress intended to do in 8(f) was

11

enable both employers and unions to step into the vacuum

12

that exists before a project is actually manned.
QUESTION;

13

Well, does 8(f) shed light on

14

whether the -- one of the requirements of a collective

15

bargaining agreement is that the union represent the

16

employees?
MR. JETT;

17

Your Honor, I believe that Section

18

8(f) specifically contemplates agreements and binding

19

agreements in which it expressly is with a minority

20

union.

21

intends, that you be able to enter into binding

22

agreements when it is conceded that the union is a

23

minority union.

24
25

That's specifically and expressly what 8(f)

That's what it says on its face.

And the only — the only point that Congress
saw fit to protect was that enabling employers and

43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

unions to step into this vacuum and deal with binding

2

contracts on the basis that met the needs of both

3

parties was the proviso — they didn’t want the

4

employers and the unions to stick, the employees with

5

something that the employees didn't want.

6

And as a matter of fact, in looking at the

7

legislative history on the purpose of the proviso, the

8

clearest explanation I find of exactly what Congress had

9

in mind and what was bothering it on the proviso appears

10

in the -- in the Committee Print of the Senate

11

Subcommittee on Labor that was published right at the

12

time the Joint Conference adopted the Senate version of

13

Section 8(f).

14

a section-by-section basis explains the proviso with a

15

more limited purpose even than what we have discusssd so

16

f ar.

17

And that proviso, or that explanation on

It says this*

Agreements permitted by this

18

section may not operate as a bar to a petition for an

19

election sought by a union not party to such

20

agreements.

21

light of that explanation, and what Congress was really

22

worrying about when it added the proviso is they —■ and

23

the legislative history shows clearly they were

24

concerned about sweetheart contracts between corrupt

25

employers and paper unions.

You look at the legislative history in

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

I cite the the Committee statement of the

2

legislative history at page 967.

3

union/sweetheart contract motive is shown in the

4

legislative history at page 425 and at pages 992 and 994.

5

And the paper

So under that circumstance, what they were

6

really protecting against is — is the employees getting

7

stuck with a sweet deal that benefited the employer and

8

the union but not the employees.

9
10

Now, the argument has been made that the
employees are disadvantaged —
QUESTION:

11

Nell, isn't it true, Mr. Jett, that

12

the — according to your position, it really doesn't

13

make any difference for the purposes of this case where

14

this majority status issue is to be litigated or even

15

whether it is to be.

16

contract's enforceable?

Until it is, you say the

17

MB. JETTs

Yes, Your Honor.

18

QUESTIONS

So you don't — it's -- it's -- all

19

you have to say is that the majority status has never

20

been determined and you're suing for back pay, so to

21

speak .

22

MR. JETTs

In terms of this contract -- or

23

this case, it is clear that there was neither

24

repudiation under the Ninth Circuit view or a

25

determination of majority status until after the period

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that was enforced in the contract.

2

would prevail on that basis.

3

important --

5

6

QUESTION i

And clearly, we

But once again, it is most

But you would like to go on

prevailing on the same contract?
NR. JETTi

It is most important that the right

7

reasons be given for that prevailing; otherwise, the

8

wrong reasons will undoubtedly lead to erroneous

9

decisions in future cases.

And certainly, the decision

10

we believe of the Ninth Circuit, at least the dictum on

11

handling majority status in the courts, would certainly

12

lead to very erroneous decisions -- that is, the

13

litigation of majority status in the courts.

14

QUESTION;

Now —

Well, I don’t -- I don’t know.

I

15

don’t know whether the court would be necessarily

16

obligated to hear the issue rather than defer to the

17

Board and tell the parties to take it to the Board as a

18

matter of primary jurisdiction.

19

MR. JETTs

Your Honor, as a matter of fact,

20

that is an extremely important point here and one

21

actually that the petitioner has taken both sides of.

22

If you look at the opening brief of the petitioner here,

23

they’ve argued that it was improper — or that the

24

District Court should have deferred to the Board, and

25

argues quite extensively that that should be done.

They

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

are now arguing essentially that, yes, it ought to he

2

litigated in the -- in the courts.

3

Now, we believe that if the Court were to take

4

the view that, yes, the agreements are void ab initio,

5

if you — if you don’t prove majority status and they’re

6

a nullity from the beginning, it would certainly be

7

better to defer to the Board for a determination of

8

majority status than to litigate in the courts.
QUESTION:

9

Mr. Jett, you don’t — I don’t

10

think you're going to — you’re going to say that every

11

time you sued on a pre-hire agreement and the employer

12

said — said, sorry, but I am repudiating right now,

13

you’re not going to wage a losing battle, you're not

14

going to litigate forever when you know you don’t have

15

majority status.

16

employer, if there is any doubt about it, or if there is

17

substantial doubt about it, is going to litigate forever

18

either.

19
20

And I am — I wouldn't think the

MR. JETTs

Well, Your Honor, of course, our —

our trustees, the parties respondent here --

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

22

MR. JETT:

— are in the position of

23

attempting to enforce the fringe benefit rights, and are

24

in the position that in order to -- if — if the Ninth

25

Circuit were to be taken at face value on the dictum,

47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

would be in the position of having to come up with union

2

majority status proved to see whether it could be proved

3

to the court's satisfaction that that was established

4

before repudiation.
We would not be in the position, of course, of

5
6

going beyond what evidence is available.

7

same time, we would have the prospect of needing to

8

enforce contract rights that have accrued to the

9

employees involved.

10

Now, I would like to —

11

QOESTIONi

But at the

Well, you certainly would agree, I

12

suppose, that if the employer took it to the Board, the

13

question of majority status to the Board, and he won,

14

that you haven't got any contract rights?

15

HR. JETT;

Your Honor, if we —

16

QUESTION;

From -- from at least the

17

prospective.
MR. JETT:

18

From that date forward, yes. Your

19

Honor.

And we have shown that.

As a matter of fact, in

20

my letter citing the two additional cases that was

21

presented to the Court today, I would like to refer to

22

the Board's policy in that matter in non-construction

23

industry cases.

24

circumstance, when a petition is filed and goes to

25

election and the contract basically is still in effect,

In a non-construction industry

48

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the Board's clear policy is that the contract remains in

2

effect to the date of Board certification of election

3

results.
QUESTIONS

4
5

And if there is unilateral change,

it's an unfair labor practice, is that it?
MR. JETT:

6
7

is correct.

8

that.

9

today.

That is correct. Your Honor.

That

But as far as — and I might refer to

That's the Trico Products case that I cited
It goes in some detail into the Board policy,

10

that to create a hiatus or instability simply on the

11

filing of the petition would be adverse to the policies

12

of the act because the employees would be unsure of what

13

their rights are until the time of actual certification.

14

QUESTIONS

But that's in a case where the

15

union had been at one time certified as the majority

16

represen tative?

17

MR. JETT:

Not necessarily so, Your Honor.

It

18

would be in a situation in which at least there had been

19

recognition of majority status, because, as I said,

20

that's a non-construction industry case.

21

not necessarily be a Board certification.

22

And that would

In other words, a petition can be filed at a

23

certain window of time during which the contract does

24

not present a bar, and when the Board then proceeds to

25

an election the Board says that its clear policy is to

49

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

maintain the status quo of the agreement until the time

2

that the election results are actually certified.

3

Now, I would like to deal with two concepts

4

that I think have -- have come round to the argument

5

that is made by petitioner in this case.

6

most important to deal with the concepts of repudiation

7

and voluntariness, in order to clarify the way in which

8

they have been intermixed.

I think it's

Hepudiation is the concept that the Board has
