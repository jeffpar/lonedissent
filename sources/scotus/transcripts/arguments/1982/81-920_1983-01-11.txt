ORAL ARGUMENT OF ABRAM CHAYES, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CHAYES:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court;
The question in this case may appear at first

12

glance to be a technical and abstract one, but it

13

touches directly and deeply the power of the national

14

government to regulate and protect the foreign relations

15

of the United States.

16

Congress in 1976, acting in the exercise of

17

its powers over foreign affairs and foreign commerce,

18

enacted the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act which was

19

comprehensive legislation establishing circumstances and

20

conditions in which suit may be brought in the courts of

21

this country against foreign sovereigns and the

22

procedures regulating such suits.

23

The question here is whether as an aspect of

24

this legislation Congress can, within the meaning of

25

Article III of the Constitution, ensure that all such
3

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, DC. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

suits against foreign sovereigns may be brought in the

2

federal courts, the courts of the nation.

3

The court below, the Second Circuit, held that

4

there was an impenetrable constitutional barrier to this

5

congressional choice.

6

petitioner in this Court, is Verlinden B. V., a Dutch

7

corporation.

8

corporation and a foreign sovereign.

Thus,

Why?

The plaintiff here,

the suit is between a foreign

The diversity clauses of Article III do not

9
10

cover such a suit.

They cover suits between a citizen

11

of the United States and a foreign sovereign, but not

12

between an alien and a foreign sovereign.

13

must be had to the arising underclause of Article III

14

which grants jurisdiction in a constitutional sense to

15

the federal judiciary over suits arising under the laws

16

of the United States.

17

that this case does not arise under the laws of the

18

United States, and so he dismissed on the constitutional

19

grounds.

So recourse

But Judge Kaufmann below held

It is our contention here and the main

20
21

propositon in this case that the case does indeed arise

22

under a law of the United States, and that law is the

23

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.

24

this —

QUESTION:

Jurisdiction in

Absent that act what would be the

situation in this case?
HR. CHAYES;

Absent that act we don't believe

3

there would be jurisdiction.

4

QUESTION;

5

MR. CHAYES:

Wouldn't be anything.
No, sir.

Jurisdiction in this

6

case is founded on the special jurisdictional section of

7

the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that codified in 28

8

USC 1330; and that provides for original jurisdiction in

9

the federal courts without regard to a mounting

10

controversy of any nonjury civil action against a

11

foreign state with respect to which the foreign state is

12

not entitled to immunity.

13

to attach, the foreign state defendant must be one --

14

must be not entitled to immunity with respect to the

15

claim asserted.

16
17

QUESTION;

So in order for jurisdiction

Mr. Chayes, is the absence of

sovereign immunity as defined in the act an element of
J

18

the plaintiff's cause of action, or is it an affirmative

19

defense, in your view?

20

MR. CHAYES;

We believe it is an element of

21

the plaintiff's case, because it is a jurisdictional

22

requirement under

23

absent the federal rules, and in the absence of the

24

federal rules, general pleading principles require that

25

the plaintiff plead and prove subject matter

1330 that sovereign immunity must be

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

jurisdiction in order to establish his case.

2

We iii so in this case.

The situation is such

3

that the defendant cannot waive or concede subject

4

matter jurisdiction, because as we know and as happened

5

in this case, the absence of subject matter jursidiction

6

can be raised by the court sua sponte or by any party at

7

any time during the course of the case; and that's what

8

happened here.

9

in case of a default the court must determine that — on

So -- and the act provides, indeed, that

10

the evidence that the plaintiff is entitled to recover,

11

which means that he must determine that there is no

12

immunity.

13

there have been defaults have followed that practice.

And the cases in the lower courts in which

So that within the narrowest notion of the

14
15

arising underclause, as Your Honor suggested, the

16

federal question of the sovereign immunity of the

17

defendant is a central element of plaintiff's claim —

18

of plaintiff's case in every instance arising under the

19

act.
But I should say that the act is much more

20
21

than a jurisdictional statute or a mere authorization to

22

sue.

Well, that was because of the

QUESTION:

grounded in the Constitution?

10

No case

So it was a -- Do you think it was

MR. CHAYES:

No.

The doctrine dates, of

11

course, from the Schooner Exchange, one of Chief Justice

12

Marshall's great opinions, in which, alluding to the

13

fact, which has been a dominant theme in soveriegn

14

immunity jurisprudence, that every case against a

15

foreign sovereign touches the dignity of the foreign

16

sovereign, and involves the foreign relations of the

17

country. Justice Marshall established the principle in

18

the Schooner Exchange that foreign sovereigns were

19

absolutely immune.

21

the United States.

22

That is, no case of any kind could

QUESTION;

When

Mr. Chayes, before the Foreign

5

Sovereign Immunities Act, there would have been no

6

jurisdictional basis for a federal court to entertain

7

this particular suit, would there?

8

9

MR. CHAYES;

It is not clear, Your Honor.

That is, until 1952, there were no in personam

10

jurisdiction against a foreign sovereign.

11

were begun by attachment of a foreign sovereign's

12

property, but I think you are correct.

13

the question that the Chief Justice asked earlier.

14

Until the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act was enacted,

15

it does not appear that there was jurisdiction for a

16

suit by an alien versus a foreign sovereign, although I

17

can’t say for sure that no such cases were brought.

18

The cases

It is what —

In 1952, as you know, again, as a matter of

19

executive policy, the United States government adopted

20

the restrictive view of foreign sovereign immunity, and

21

the State Department indicated that it would not suggest

22

immunity in cases growing out of the commercial acts of

23

foreign sovereigns.

24

part of the Department of State.

25

State was not bound by that, and in fact in some cases

But that was an act of grace on the
The Department of

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

involving commercial acts the State Department did

2

suggest immunity.

3

The jurisprudence of this Court tells us that

4

the Court, this Court, the state courts, and the federal

5

courts were bound by the executive -- by the executive

6

suggestion and could not disregard it, and in the

7

absence of a suggestion, the Republic of Mexico versus

8

Hoffman tells us that the Court had to follow the

9

policies enunciated by the State Department.

10

But as I said, the Foreign Sovereign

11

Immunities Act has changed all of that.

12

instance, it judicializes the whole field of foreign

13

sovereign immunity, and remits the question of sovereign

14

immunity to judicial determination.

15

the restrictive theory of immunity, and subjects foreign

16

sovereigns to suit in cases arising out of commercial

17

transactions, ordinary torts, and that sort of thing,

18

directly parallel, both in concept and language, to the

19

Tucker Act and the Federal Tort Claims Act, by which the

20

United States has consented to sue against itself.

21

QUESTION:

In the first

Second, it codifies

Mould you say, Mr. Chayes, that

22

this dichotomy that was developed in 1952 is somewhat

23

analogous to the old concept of proprietary and

24

governmental functions?

25

MR. CHAYES:

Yes.

Exactly so, Mr. Chief

call it use imperii and use guesti, but it was the same

general kind of distinction.

4

doesn't quite take the old line.

5

foreign sovereign makes a contract, it doesn't matter

6

whether it is a contract for guns for the army or for

7

wheat for the starving poor, that is contract, and the

8

government ought to respond according to the laws of

9

contract.

10

In fact, we used to talk about it in Latin and

That is, now the Act
It says, when the

It doesn't matter what the ultimate purpose

of the contract is.

government.

But it's the same general conception, Your

21

1976 was, you could never get attachment against foreign

22

23

25

Of course, the situation until the

One of the major departures of the Act was to

extent of liability, so that we see here an extended,

comprehensive legislative pattern, legislative structure

foreign sovereign expressly made binding on both state

6

and federal courts as a pre-emptive exercise of federal

Now, there is no doubt that this case falls
within the statute.

It is the only way that Congress could have

fulfilled its twin purposes, which were to provide

the same time to concentrate that litigation in the

12

And finally, I think it makes — it is

20

that it was the purpose of the Act to concentrate the

The

so any suit begun in a state court may be removed by the

3

4

5

It is not subject to the

The fact of the matter is, of course, that

6

most actions that have been begun in state courts have

7

in fact been removed, and the Congress in the

8

legislative history stated that the purpose of the

9

removal jurisdiction was to provide for concentration of

10

the suits -- of the litigation in the federal courts,

11

for two reasons.

12

decision, and second, to ensure that the delicacy and

First, to ensure uniformity of

3

sensitivity of the question of suits against a foreign

4

sovereign would be recognized in the courts of the

5

nation, the nation being the one that bears

6

international responsibility for the acts of the

7

judicial department.

8
9

So, there is no doubt that that was the
purpose of the statute.

I do want to say that -- what I

20

started, that there is no problem here of a flood of

21

litigation that would be inappropriate for determination

22

in the federal courts.

23

set of thresholds and limits than the party plaintiff.

24

It required in 1505(a) and 1605, 6, and 7, the statutes

25

withdrawing — the sections withdrawing immunity, it

Congress established a different

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

required that for immunity to be withdrawn, the

2

transaction in suit had to have substantial connection

3

with the United States, as was the case here, where the

4

transaction was financed through the Morgan Bank, in New

5

York.

6

So, the alien will not be able to bring suit

7

unless the transaction has substantial connection with

8

the United States, and once that is so, it seems to me

9

hard to argue that suits against a foreign sovereign are

10

not most appropriate for determination in the federal

11

courts.

12

Hamilton, who in the 81st Federalist said that since the

13

nation will be responsible for the judgment of its

14

courts in suits touching foreign citizens and foreign

15

affairs, the nation — the courts of the nation should

16

have jurisdiction to hear them.

17

That goes all the way back to Alexander

We maintain that the statute as so construed

18

is constitutional.

19

I gave in the answer to Justice O'Connor's question that

20

the plaintiff's case contains a necessary federal

21

element, the absence of immunity, and it is

22

constitutional under the teaching of the Osborn case,

23

which says that where Congress has legislated on a

24

matter within its competence, here the foreign relations

25

of the United States, and has legislated

It is constitutional for the reason

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

comprehensively, it may grant jurisdiction to cases

2

arising within that — within the ambit of that

3

legislative program, even though the particular case may

4

not be governed on the merits by federal law.
So, for those two reasons, it seems to me the

5
6

jurisprudence of this Court makes it clear that the

7

statute as construed is constitutional, and this cases

8

arises under the Constitution and laws of the United

9

States within the meaning of Article III.
QUESTION*

10

We don't need to decide the case on

11

any broader basis for you to win than to say that the

12

Congress may vest the decision of any federal question

on that.

QUESTION!

6

MR. CHAYESi

Yes.

I will -- I —

Whether it is in defense or —
That is correct.

You don't have

7

to decide it on any broader basis than the basis that

was involved in my response to Justice O'Connor's

question, and we feel that on that basis it is a very

20

easy case.

Claims Act, in which -- which this Court has said cases

exactly what this is.

25

It is no different than the Federal Tort

That is

And therefore, although it seems to me

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

perfectly clear that the Osborn rationale covers this

2

case, you are quite right, Justice White, that you don't

3

have to go anywhere near that far to decide in our favor.

4
5
6

QUESTION;

Does that still leave you with the

question of a substantial connection?
MR. CHAYES:

No, Your Honor.

That issue was

7

decided in the consolidated appeal below, with respect

8

to five cases that were identical in terms of

9

substantial connection with this case.

All of those

10

five cases, the court of appeals found, had the

11

substantial connection, in Texas Trading, Texas Milling

12

and Trading versus the Republic of Nigeria.

13

The only thing that differentiated those five

14

cases from this one was the citizenship of the

15

plaintiff, and the legislative history says that the

16

citizenship of the plaintiff should not constitute a

17

connection, and of course the jurisprudence of this

18

Court under International Shoe suggests the same thing.

19

I would like, if I may, Your Honors, to

20

reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

ON BEHALF OF U. S. AS AMICUS CURIAE

25

MR. BATOR:

Thank you.

Very well.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

please the Court, it is the government’s submission in

2

this case that important diplomatic and foreign

3

relations interests of the United States will be

4

adversely affected if the holding of the court of

5

appeals is affirmed, and if suits by foreigners against

6

foreign countries are relegated to the state courts.
The single most critical proposition relevant

7
8

to this case is one that oddly enough nobody disputes at

9

all.

That proposition is that it is for Congress to
whether and on wha t

10

decide, as a matter of fede ral law,

11

conditions a f oreign countr y should be amenable to suit

1.2

in an American court , wheth er by a plaintiff or an

13

American -- a foreigner or an American citizen.

14

Nobody argues that this question is reserved

15

to the states or is governed by state law.

16

regulatory Article I authority, Congress has power to

17

decide as a matter of the diplomatic foreign relations

18

and foreign commerce interests of the United States,

19

whether foreign countries should be amenable to suit.

20

QUESTION*

Under its

Well, do you think under Article I

21

Congress could simply pass a statute that said any time

22

a foreign government wants to sue or be — or someone

23

wants to sue a foreign government in this country, we

24

aren't laying down any sort of law at all to govern the

25

suits, but the federal district court shall have

17

original jurisdiction?

2

SR. 3AT0R:

There would be an antecedent

3

question in that case. Justice Rehnquist, which is

4

whether the transaction sued on has such connection to

5

the United States that it is a legitimate, rational

6

QUESTION:

Well, supposing Congress said, we

7

don't care whether the transaction had any rational

8

connection.

9

in this particular case there was no connection at a 11.

We want all such suits brought here.

SR. BATOR:

10

A nd

Well, I can conceive of a case

11

where the suit by a foreigner against a foreign coun try

12

would be so foreign to any substantive American cone ern

whatever that it shouldn't be in an American court a t

QUESTION:

It may be — it may be that -- you

see, if the case is going to be in an American court,

12

then it seems to me there clearly must be protective

seems to me that this question could be divided into two

parts.

the affirmative, that the transaction between the

22

foreigner and the foreign government is sufficiently

American to make it legitimate to authorize an American

2

Now, on that point, the diplomatic and foreign

3

relations interest of the United States comes into play,

4

because in this Court’s jurisprudence and in the

5

legislative history of this statute, the one thing that

was clear was the judgment that a uniform, sensitive

national resolution of the question of the amenability

of a foreign government to sue in the courts of this

country needed a federal national solution.

Under your view. Hr. Bator, as I

2

matching Article III power under the arising under

clause to call on federal trial courts to apply and

4

interpret and enforce that scheme.

5

surprising conclusion of the court of appeals in this

6

case was that although Congress has power as a matter of

7

federal law to regulate the question of amenability, the

8

Constitution requires it to leave the enforcement of its

regulatory scheme to a state court.

That is, the

Now, it is that proposition that turns the

10

In this case, the Court does

not need to worry about some of the more far-reaching

conclusions of Chief Justice Marshall in Osborn, just as

comprehensive statute which governs this important and

sensitive diplomatic issue, and now it says the

enforcement of that question and the decision of issues

under this statute should be in the hands of the federal

courts.

Under the opinion of the court of appeals in
this case, we are in this really anomalous situation.

MR. BATOR:

Could it?

Well, in order for the case to be

removable by the foreign government, it would have to

11

first be determined that it is a case arising under

12

federal law for purposes of Article III.

13

say, if this statute is unconstitutional in the way it

confers original jurisdiction, it would be very hard to

see how it is constitutional in allowing a defendant to

remove the case to federal court.

the clause, under this Act because in order for this

case to be in the court, at the forefront of the case,

What did Congress say about state

MR. BATOR;

'76 Act?

Congress permitted plaintiffs to

8

choose a state court, but Congress very plainly said

9

that in any case where the plaintiff chooses a state

10

court, the defendant foreign government has an automatic

11

right to take it to federal court, and Congress in its

12

reports made it very clear why it wished that removal

13

power to exist.

14

The report of the Senate and the House says,

15

in view of the potential sensitivity of actions against

16

foreign states and the importance of developing a

17

uniform body of law in this area, it is important to

give foreign states clear authority to remove to a

Is there any explanation in the

and taken away with the other?

MR. BATOR;

Congress did not feel it wanted to cut down on the

these cases, because foreign countries themselves have

In that case, the Court found that Nigeria's activity in

that the other party had to be a citizen, and the rule

of strict construction set forth in Romero versus

because the federal rules require you to make a

on to say that the claim itself is set forth

MR. SHULMAN:

Because you do not have a case

or controversy under -- involving the Foreign Sovereign

18

Immunities Act until that issue is raised and

19

litigated.

20

against a foreign sovereign, let us say in a state

21

court, removed by the foreign sovereign, who does not go

22

on to assert immunity, and the case would go through the

23

federal court without a federal issue ever having come

24

up.

25

You could have a case brought by a plaintiff

In that case, it would have been an improper

MR. SHULMAN:
QUESTION:

That’s correct.

So it seems to me that as long as

11

the sovereign immunity defense is maintained, and if you

12

agree that we would have appellate jurisdiction over a

13

state case which has no other federal question in it,

14

then does it not follow within the meaning of Article

15

III that that case arises under federal law?

16

MR. SHULMAN;

No.

It does follow within the

17

meaning of Article III that that case or controversy

18

arises under federal law for purposes of appellate

19

jurisdiction, because at that point in the schedule, you

20

have a case or controversy.

QUESTION;

That’s correct, and

I believe --

Then does that act — does not that

21

MR. SHULMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, the question

22

of when a claim arises, a claim arises under a statute

23

involves whether or not the source of the right that you

24

are asserting is a federal law or not.

25

the fact that there is lurking in the background of the

This is the —

which a federal question is presented which may

6

matter of original jurisdiction in the district court.

8
9

It makes it a case in

But it does not mean that it becomes a

Now, I would like to say a word about the
protective jurisdiction concept which has floated about

10

the briefs a bit, and specifically the petitioner's

11

brief raises four areas in which it suggests that there

12

is a protective jurisdiction of some sort here.
Those four areas are the Osborn v. Bank of

13
14

United States area which Hr. Bator also sought to assert

15

as a basis, the removal of state proceedings against

16

federal officers for actions under color of their

17

office, the authority of a bankruptcy trustee to sue in

18

federal court on a state law claim, and then the

19

National Mutual Insurance Company v. Tidewater Transfer

20

case and the Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills

21

case.

22

Now, in the first three of those suggested

23

bases of protective jurisdiction, you see the difference

24

between a true federal interest in the ultimate

25

disposition of the case and a collateral federal

38

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

interest in one question in the issue.

2

In Osborn, the basic powers of the bank, the

3

rights and liabilities of the bank, the whole aspect of

4

the bank was a matter of federal interest.

5

removal cases, the federal interest was the assurance

6

that federal officers would not be impeded in the

7

performance of their duties by states.
QUESTION:

In the

Why is that -- Why would you say

that is arising under, or why would you say that —

10

certainly the substantive rule of those removal cases

11

isn't necessarily federal law.
MR. SHULMANi

12

That's correct, Your Honor, but

13

the necessity for a federal officer to be able to

14

perform his duties without impediment by the state is a

15

federal matter of -- basic to the whole issue.
QUESTION:

16

You don't think the federal

17

government has the same sort of an interest in assuring

18

foreign governments that they can litigate in the right

forum?

20

MR. SHULMAN:

That is exactly the point that I

21

am trying to get at, Mr. Justice White, and it is that

22

there is a difference between the federal interest in

23

the ultimate issue at stake and the federal interest in

24

an issue along the way, that the issue, the ultimate

25

issue at stake here is whether or not this letter of

that there would be a federal common law applied which

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18

MR. CHAYES;

19

First, as to your question whether this case

20

could have been brought before 1976, the answer is no.

21

What happened in 1976 was that the Congress exercised

22

its Article I legislative power, and by doing so created

23

as an essential aspect, as an essential part of the

24

plaintiff's case here the issue of sovereign immunity.

25

Mr. Chief Justice — Thank you.

As Justice Marshall suggested, that was
