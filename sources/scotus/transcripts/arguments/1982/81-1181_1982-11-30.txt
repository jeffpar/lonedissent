ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GARDNER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

This case involves the crash of a C-5A

Lockheed in September of 1970.

the claim of the United States to immunity or absence of

liability because of the provisions of Section 8116(c)

of Title V.

5

There remains open only

That exclusive liability provision is printed

6

at page 2 of the blue brief.

The Government insists

7

that its plain words provide that the Government should

8

be liable to no one in respect of an employee covered by

9

the Employees' Compensation Act.
We would be inclined to agree with the

10

Government if the statute stopped at the fifth line as

we have printed it.

It would then reads

"The liability

If there came at that point a period, as I

17
18

have indicated, we think the Government would be right.

19

Instead, the statute goes on for another eight lines,

20

all of which would seem to be surplussage in the

21

Government reading.

22

Moreover, those eight lines themselves contain

23

a second, inexplicable redundancy under the Government's

reading.

QUESTION:

2

Well, Mr. Gardner, isn't that a

3

fairly rational drafting of a sentence that starts with

4

the noun "liability” and then is talking about the

5

liability — what liability, the liability to, and then

6

starting in the sixth line, to the employee, his legal

7

representative —
MB. GARDNER:

8
9

Yes, sir, I think it's an

entirely rational statute.

I think this has three times

10

been so read by this Court.

It is barring the liability

11

of the employee and those who claim through the employee

12

because of the injury or death.

13

reading would exclude the limiting clauses which I have

14

summarized as saying those who claim through the

15

employee.

17

person, period.

The Government in its

I would think the government should have some

5

explanation for what by its reading must be a pervasive

6

and persistent addiction to surplussage over a period of

7

60 years by four legislatures.

No, sir.

And would you say that the term

seventh and eighth lines, would you say that covered* an

almost identical form as they appeared in the

statutory history, the Court said that the statute was

2

drawn from the Longshoremen Workers — Longshoremen and

3

Harbor Workers' Act and from the New York statute in

4

1922.

5

In 1938,

11 years before this enactment, the

6

New York Court of Appeals had decided the Westchester

Lighting case.

gas main of the lighting company.

14

its own injury and not for the injury to the deceased

employee.

so far as I could tell it would be forced to urge upon

2

this Court that neither the members of Congress nor the

3

Congressional committees or the staff or the committees

4

or the lawyers at the Federal Security Agency, which

5

drafted this statute by copying the provisions of the

6

New York statute, had any idea how the New York statute

7

had been interpreted.

9

It seems to us most improbable.

I'd like to return for a moment to the merits
of the Weyerhaeuser case.

There an Army dredge collided

10

with the Weyerhaeuser liner off the coast of Oregon.

11

suit against Weyerhaeuser and received a judgment.

QUESTION;

7

Mr. Gardner, are you going to touch

on the independent duty and derivative?
MR. GARDNER;

8
9

Yes, sir.

I plan, if Your Honor will give

me a minute or two to, in the vernacular, go to town on

10

that one.

It is to my mind something that deserves a

11

great deal of comment, all of which should be adverse.
Nothing in Section 8116(c) draws any

12

13

distinction between admiralty and law, between divided

14

damages and tort indemnity, nor indeed any distinction

15

between the government employee who travels on an Army

16

dredge in contrast to the one who travels on an Air

17

Instead, it said that for Lockheed to recover it must

show an independent duty, independent, that is, of the

The last thought which I would like to present

1
2

to the Court relates to the policies which the Congress

3

has uniformly followed in these exclusive liability

4

provisions.

5

without offering a compensating benefit called sometimes

6

7

employee, who is forbidden to bring suit against the

8

Government in search of a jury verdict, is given a fast,

9

fault-free, prompt award, which at least in the years

10

close to the enactment of the provision is a generous

11

one .

It has never curtailed a right or a remedy

Thus, the

The Government, stripped of its customary

12
13

defenses, or the stevedoring employer in the other act

14

of contributory negligence, assumption of risk and so

15

on, gains a ceiling, a definite, assured limit to its

16

liability.

17

In 1972 the Congress amended the

18

Longshoremen 's Act in two respects.

First, it

19

eliminated the liability without fault of the vessel

20

based on the unseaworthiness doctrine to the

21

longshoremen.

22

that, it went on to eliminate the claim over by the

23

vessel against the stevedore on the ground that if the

24

vessel was now liable only for its own negligence, there

25

was no occasion to limit the claim over.

Having done that, and only because it did

QUESTION;

11

Mr. Gardner, may I ask, even if we

12

were to agree with you on your interpretation of the

13

Section 8116(c), what would we do about determining

14

whether there is a substantive right to indemnity under

15

the D.C. law?

Would the Court have to remand?

MR. GARDNER:

that there was no bar found in 8116(c).

ON EEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

25

MS. CORWIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
The section that is at issue in this case is a

1

portion of a major workers' compensation program.

It

2

was enacted by Congress in 1916, and it covers virtually

3

all Federal civilian employees.

4

Under the program, an employee who is injured

5

on the job receives compensation, and that compensation

6

occurs promptly, it occurs without regard to the fault

7

of either the employer or the employee, and it occurs

8

without litigation.

It is an administrative scheme.

Thus, in the present case the Federal

9

10

employee, Ann Nash Bottorff, was aboard the C-5A when it

11

crashed and who died in that crash, had survivors.

12

Those survivors applied for death benefits under the

13

Federal Employees Compensation Act.

14

that Ms. Bottorff was in the course of her duties at the

15

time of the crash, and the survivors received death

16

benefits.

It was concluded

17

Benefits are paid out of the Employees'

18

Compensation Fund within the Treasury Department.

19

Benefits paid out at the present time are running around

20

$1 billion per year.

21

the Federal Employees' Compensation program essentially

22

take the place of tort damages that an employee might

23

otherwise be entitled to recover.

litigation that would arise if work-related injuries

Now, this creates what has been referred to as

Congress did mention frequently in the

portions in our brief on page 36 — Congress expected

that by enacting Section 8116(c) there would be an end

to this sort of litigation; that agencies would be free

11

to proceed with their business, that they would not be

Virtually all workers' compensation programs

16

include this sort of limited liability feature.

17

this Court on several occasions has acknowledged in the

18

context of other compensation statutes that the limited

19

liability feature creates a protective mantle for the

20

employer, the federal agency in this case.

21

And

Under the Longshoremen's statute this Court

22

stated in Cooper Stevedoring that there was a protective

23

mantle created by limited liability and that that mantle

24

extended to third party claims against the employer

25

which had arisen out of the claim of the employee

QUESTIONi

Ms. Corwin, is there any weight of

3

authority among state decisions interpreting state

4

workmen's compensation laws as to whether the

5

governmental employer would be liable in a situation

6

like this or whether a private employer would be liable

7

in a situation like this?

8

9
10
11

MS. CORWIN;

There is indeed authority to that

effect, and I believe we've cited in our brief some of
the summary discussion of that issue by Professor Larson.
QUESTION;

Yeah.

I asked you whether there

12

was authority to the effect that the Government would be

13

liable, and you said, I believe, that yes, there was a

14

lot of authority that the Government would be liable.

15

Is that what you meant to say?

16

MS. CORWIN;

No.

I must have misunderstood

17

your question.

18

indication under the state laws governing private

19

employers is that the employer is immune from this sort

20

of third party suit; that in addition to the liability,

21

limited liability vis-a-vis the employee or any

22

dependents or whatever, in addition, any sort of third

23

part suit of the sort that Petitioner is urging here

24

also is barred.

25

I did not mean to say that.

The

Now, Petitioner's counsel raised the New York

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

law and suggested that we had not addressed the New York

2

law.

3

our brief that there is some question as to what the New

4

York law in fact was at the time of passage in 1949 of

5

this section.

6

I believe we've indicated at least at one point in

I think it's important to note that both the

7

House and Senate reports on this legislation do not

8

refer to the New York law; rather, the language that

9

Congress used was state workmen's compensation laws in

10

general have this sort of provision, referring to the

11

exclusive liability provision.

12

New York laws — Petitioner has referred to it in its

13

brief -- but that mention is in the hearings, and it is

14

in the context of mentioning that this legislation is

15

based on the Longshoremen's statute, the New York

16

statute and other workers' compensation statutes.

17
18
19

QUESTIONS

There is some mention of

These were the 1949 hearings, not

the original enactment of the LHWCA.
NS. CORWINi

That's correct.

This is in 1949

20

when Congress was looking at this problem that the

21

Federal agencies had brought up to it, and there was

22

realization that in fact there were models for this sort

23

of provision around, that states had it, that the

24

Longshoremen's statute had it, and in fact that this was

25

something that might fit the bill for the Federal

1

agencies
Now, I suggest that New York, was one among

2
3

many and that if there was any model, perhaps it was the

4

Longshoremen's statute, which as this Court has observed

5

is very close to the language here.
The New York situation in 1949 was simply not

6
7

that clear.

Petitioner's counsel has referred to the

8

Westchester Lighting case in 1938.

9

interpreted by the Second Circuit on several occasions

That case has been

10

as referring to a contractual sort of claim, not a tort

11

claim of the type that Petitioner is urging, but rather

12

-- and this is where the independent duty language comes

13

in — the Court used the term "independent duty" in the

14

New York case, but the Second Circuit has interpreted

15

that as a duty arising out of a contractual relationship

16

between the lighting company and the landowner in that

17

case.

18

contemplating New York law vis-a-vis tort indemnity of

19

the sort the Petitioner is urging here.

20

So it is not at all clear that anyone was

The Longshoremen's statute is not the only

21

area that this Court has looked at with respect to the

22

limited liability feature of a compensation scheme.

23

24

25

similar to the one that's put forward here.

It involved product liability.

The Court examined several features of that

3

case, and one of them was the limited liability feature

4

of the military compensation statute.

5

referred, as it had in the Longshoremen's case, to the

6

protective mantle that is granted to an employer under a

7

compensation statute, and it said that it's an essential

8

feature of a compensation scheme such as the military

9

compensation scheme that was before it, and I suggest

The Court again

10

such as the compensation scheme that applies to Federal

11

civilian employees.

12

The Court indicated that it would be a

13

circumvention of that limited liability feature for the

14

Court to permit the third party claim that was urged so

15

strenuously in that case.

16

applies to this statute as well — again, the limited

17

liability feature in a workers' compensation scheme.

18

In essence --

QUESTION:

20
21

That sort of reasoning

How do you overcome the

Weyerhaeuser case, however?
KS. CORWIN:

I think that this Court in the

22

Weyerhaeuser case was looking at a rather different

23

situation than what we have in this case.

24

Weyerhaeuser was not a tort, a purely tort claim.

25

was not even under the Tort Claims Act.

The claim in
It

It's not the

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

sort we have here.

Instead, it was an admiralty claim.

2

The Court perceived — the Court described it in terms

3

of an ancient rule that seemed to have governed rights

4

and duties in the area of collisions in the maritime

5

area.
The Court also looked at the fact that it had

6
7

decided the case long ago, long before the Federal

8

Employees Compensation Act was even enacted initially in

9

1916.

The Court in the preceding century had decided

10

the Chatahoochee, another admiralty case involving the

11

divided damages rule.

12

to reconcile what it had before it in Weyerhaeuser with

13

what it had decided in the past and — and had been on

14

the books at the time the Compensation passed -- Act was

15

passed.

16

And I think the Court was seeking

Essentially, I think what the Court saw in

17

Weyerhaeuser was something it viewed as analogous to the

18

contractual indemnity provision that -- or contractual

19

— implied contractual indemnity in Ryan.

20

Weyerhaeuser did turn to Ryan and said we don't find a

21

contract here, but we find something that's very similar

22

to the contract, and therefore, we think that Congress

23

probably did not intend.

24

Ryan which we've already said is not barred by the

25

Longshoremen's equivalent provision.

The Court in

2

QUESTION;

But the language used certainly is

3

broad enough to have some implications here, wouldn’t

4

you agree?

5

MS. CORWINj

I think that the Court did make

6

some statements about the language in Weyerhaeuser that

7

do appear to be broad, but I think the language that

8

you’re referring to is not necessary to the Court’s

9

decision in that case, and I think in fact what the

10

Court concluded was that the language simply was not

11

enough to allow it to answer that question that was

12

before it in Weyerhaeuser.

13

The conclusion of the Court was that the

14

language simply wasn’t — it wasn’t plain, and it had

15

looked through the legislative history, and it didn't

16

find a mention of third parties; and, therefore, it felt

17

it ought to move on and consider these other features

18

I’ve referred to — the ancient admiralty rule, the

19

analogy to Ryan.

20

I think that the Court was simply not faced

21

with the sort of tort indemnity claim that we have here

22

in which the liability alleged is basically a — the

23

liability of a joint tort feaser.

24

some sort of contract.

out of the injury or death of a crewman?

QUESTIONS

And that’s what -- that’s what the

Court said could be claimed over.
MS. CORWINs

Well, the Court was not

necessarily talking about a claim over in that case.

12

was referring to a rule under the admiralty system in

13

which the damages, all sorts of damages, were really put

MS. CORWINs

Well, I think that -That’s what it was.
— One could argue that it is the

added in 1949, and there was no explanation of why there

what one finds in the Longshoremen statute and a number

of state statutes.

that the Court found in that case and that the

focus was is there something other than tort liability

here; can we look to the relationship between the

The Court concluded in that case that yes, it

address the problem that Petitioner presents; that of

this noncontractual indemnity, the purely tort-based

indemnity.

I think that this Court and the lower courts

looking to this Court's decisions have been rather

careful to distinguish that sort of contract, whether it

be express or implied, frCm the kind of pure joint tort

Now, I don *t know exactly why Congress chose

the particular enumerations it did.

13

been that the thought was to give some notice to

individuals that would be affected by this act to be

sure everybody understood just who was excluded.

16

think that the addition of the rather very broad phrase

17

"all other persons" or "anyone," as it was at that time,

18

"anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages," I think

19

that is a broad phrase that one simply ought not to

MS. CORWIN:

Yeah.
I think when you look at the

legislative history you don't find any expectation on

10

the part of Congress that this limited liability feature

11

is going to be somehow breached in particular cases.

12

You don’t have Congress giving any indication that its

expectations about the savings of money to government,

14

and particularly the savings in litigation having to be

in court all the time over these thousands of

16

work-related accidents, you don't find any indication

that Congress thought sometimes this will be the case

believe this is going to keep the agencies out of the

courts.

21

Rather, the statements were we

So I think you have to read the statutory

language in light of that expectation.

You have to read

23

it in light of the expectation that under a compensation

scheme the limited liability feature is going to be an

25

effective one; that it ought not be circumvented, as the
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

were, you would have the anomaly under which the mere

fortuity of the involvement of a third party in an

accident would break down the limited liability feature;

that is, if you had the Government as the only party and

19

differing degree of responsibility?

20

MS. CORWIN:

Isn't the

I'm not sure there's any way to

21

limit Petitioner's claim in that manner.

The sort of

22

allegation in the question presented is framed in terms

23

of active negligence and secondary liability.

24

it was Justice Black who pointed out in his dissent in

Well, your impression then is that

3

the Petitioner's claim would claim the same sort of

4

right even if it were just simply two joint feasers,

5

neither of whom would be entitled to contribution from

6

the other at common law, by the law of the state?

7

MS. CORWIN;

I think that's correct.

I don’t

8

see any way to really cut off this principle at some 50

9

percent level.

And as I say, I'm not sure what active

10

negligence means, but if it means more than 50 percent

11

I'm not sure why this principle that breaks down the

12

limited liability can apply on a 51 percent liability

13

but not on 49 percent liability.

14

I don't see anything in the way that

15

Petitioner has framed its argument in this case that

16

really limits to something like an indemnity claim as

17

opposed to a contribution claim.

18

have recognized that this sort of indemnity claim, not

based on a contract but based on differing degrees of

negligence, is really an extreme form of contribution.

These are things that are — and

25

later version -- it said these duties are on account of

2

are simply not the sorts of independent duties that

3

other courts have been talking about, and those are

4

things like the Ryan implied contractual indemnity and

5

perhaps this divided damages rule.

6

So do you think -- do you think we

7

need deal at all with the independent duty?

8

think there's any claim here that the Government's

9

liability rests on that?

10

MS. CORWIN;

Do you

I think that — I think not.

11

think Petitioner has suggested that it is not

12

particularly interested in pressing that point, and I

13

think that any independent duty as formulated by any

14

other court is more a matter of contract and not this

15

sort of pure indemnity claim.

I believe Justice O'Connor asked Petitioner's

I’m

The question here is simply should

Now, Petitioner has referred to itself in the
brief as a stranger to the compensation system* and we

10

suggest that that’s not really the case.

11

compensation systems have been around for a long time,

12

and I think that Petitioner is well aware of them in the

13

state context* in fact, probably takes advantage of this

14

employer.

16

contractor and is used to dealing with the government;

17

in fact, could have anticipated that in this case the

18

likeliest thing that could have happened would be the

19

C-5A going down with a full complement of troops,

20

military personnel; and under Stencel Aero this Court

21

has said that there would be simply no chance of a third

22

party claim in that case.

The

Petitioner is an experienced government

So I think that Petitioner is complaining

24

largely about the fact that the tort system allows a

25

plaintiff to recover against single tort feaser and

2

this is the sort of thing that can be foreseen and

planned against, particularly by someone in Petitioner's

situation.
In sum, we urge that this Court protect the

limited liability feature that we think Congress fully

intended in

into the act.

The

Government naturally seizes upon one of the three

16

factors which the Court in the aggregate found

17

sufficient to bar recovery over by the contractor.

18

Those three factors were the preeminence of the Federal

19

interest and the undesirability of subjecting it to

20

state law in the conduct of military operations.

21

second factor was the compensation system which was in

22

effect for the serviceman.

23

overwhelming factor, in my view, is the fact you can

neither discipline troops nor conduct wars in terms of

tort litigation.

I would suggest that the Brown case, decided

after Feres, and the Brooks case cited before it dealing
