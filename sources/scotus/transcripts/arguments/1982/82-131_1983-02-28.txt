ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. MURDOCH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
This case is before you on a writ of
certiorari from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and

10

presents two questions for your consideration.

11

first question being the interpretation of some of the

12

provisions under Section 905(a), 905(b), and 933 of the

13

Longshoremen’s and Harbor Worker’s Compensation Act.

14

The second question is a question regarding major

15

damages which was applied by the lower court and

16

affirmed by the Third Circuit in this particular case.

17

The

By way of background, the respondent was an

18

employee of Jones £ Laughlin Steel Corporation.

19

worked for them on the rivers, particularly on the

20

Monongahela River for Jones £ Laughlin for many years.

21

He was entitled as having the duties of being a barge

22

hel per and b arge handler.

23

and he would work with the barges.

He had

1

The first landing had an elevator which they would take

2

these barges, and the barges being approximately 175

3

feet long, 26 feet wide, under the coal elevator.

4

would then empty the barge as the coal goes into the

5

metal freeze, and persons like Mr. Pfeifer would then be

6

in charge of taking care of the fleet as the empty

7

barges would be moved down to the other fleet.

8

Mr. Pfeifer was injured on February 13,

9

at which time he came out to work on the midnight

shift.

11

his normal job was a Class 7 job, but as he would do

12

from time to time, he would come out and he worked as a

13

headman, this was a Class 13 as far as the pay is

14

concerned.

15

He did not work his normal job at that time,

In that position Mr. Pfeifer was in charge of

clear of snow
As I say, Mr. Pfeifer came out to work at

2

3

midnight on this particular shift, and sometime later,

4

3:00 a.m., or 4:00 a.m., while going out with two other

5

individuals to pump a large, he slipped on some ice and

6

snow that had been accumulated on the barge and injured

7

his back.

8

Pfeifer did sign the proper forms for getting payments

9

under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's

10

As a result of that incident, then, Mr.

Compensation Act.
I think it is important for you to know as a

11

12

Court that Jones £ Laughlin has been paying Mr. Pfeifer

13

for the compensation benefits as called for under this

14

Act ever since the date of the accident.
At the time of the trial in this particular

15
16

case in which there was a final verdict rendered against

17

Jones £ Laughlin Steel Corporation in the amount of

18

approximately $275,OOO, there was a set off which was

19

approximately $33,000 for the compensation benefits

20

which had been made to Mr. Pfeifer as of the date of the

21

trial.

22

I believe it is also important for you to know

23

that even today as I stand here arguing this case before

24

you, we are still making payments under the Compensation

25

Act as called for.

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

I think this is relatively important because

1

2

905(a) of the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Worker's Act

3

sets forth what we refer to as the exclusivity

4

provision, which states basically that a person injured

5

under the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Worker’s Act has

6

exclusive remedies to receive compensation from the

7

employer.
This is why I pointed out that under these

8

9

circumstances we have been and in fact are still paying

10

because as Jones £ Laughlin looks at and reviews the

11

exclusivity provision, we feel that that is the only

12

basis that an employee is to receive benefits from the

13

employer.
QUESTION;

14

That would be traditional in those

15

workmen's compensation type claims.

16

with the language of this Court in the Edmonds case

17

which seems to have rejected your position, and in this

18

limited situation would say that the ship owner is still

19

liable both under the underlying tort claim and as under

20

the Act.

21

HR. MURDOCH:

22

QUESTION;

23

I think. Justice O'Connor --

Do you think that we were in error

in Edmonds?
MR. MURDOCH;

24
25

But what do you do

yes.

I believe you are in error,

I don’t believe that when you review Edmonds,

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

which in that particular instance concerning the point

2

that I am talking to you about today was strictly dicta,

3

it was not a part of that particular case, although it

4

was part of the discussion.
QUESTION;

5

But it was a pretty clear

6

statement.

7

now that changed this precise —

8

HR. MURDOCH:

9

Is there not legislation pending in Congress

There is in the legislation

history as it appears, although the amendments to the

10

Longshoremen's and Harbor worker's Act are still

11

pending, they have set forth the case of Griffith versus

12

Wheeling-Pittsburgh as being something that was not

13

intended from the 1972 amendments.

14

I will give you some background.

In 1972,

15

there was an amendment by 905(b), which is the section

16

that was discussed in Edmonds and came into play.

17

look at the Edmonds decision, as I look at the

18

Griffith/Wheeling-Pittsburgh case, I feel that was done

19

in that particular instance, though, was the failure to

20

look at sections 905(a), 905(b), and section 933, as

21

they are all read together.

22

As I

Though This Court, even as recently as last

23

Wednesday, set forth in the case of Lockheed versus the

24

United States that 905(a) was the exclusive remedy under

25

the Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's 3enefit Act.

As

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

we look, at 905(a), it simply says that this is the only

2

thing that the employee is entitled to.

3

Setting to 905(b) and looking at the

4

legislative intent of the amendments back in

5

have in most workermen’s compensation areas you had the

6

quid pro quo.

7

they might have had before the amendments to sue for

8

unseaworthiness or to sue for indemnity in response for

9

largely increased benefits.

10

1972, as we

You had the giving up of any rights that

These benefits are taken under section 910 and

11

they set forth that as of June 1st of each year the

12

different values are placed on as to what the increase

13

is going to be for the benefits, and then they are

14

implemented in October of that particular year.

15

So the position that we have here is that

16

because of the 1972 amendments giving such a large

17

increase in benefits to these longshoremen that it did

18

away with what was the dual capacity.

19

I think it is important that you look at

20

905(b) as it applies to 905(a) and 933.

905(b)

21

basically starts off by saying that any person injured

22

under this particular Act has the benefits of this Act.

23

I stress that it says "any person" because in looking at

24

the Edmonds case there is a distinction that the Court

25

brought or the Court intended to bring up by saying that

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the first sentence only applies to a longshoreman.
I disagree with that because if you go one

2
3

step further, it says in 905(b) if there is the right,

4

then, to sue the vessel or vessel as a person that the

5

employer cannot be. directly or indirectly liable.
So where I have the problem with Edmonds is

6
7

that it did not go far enough with the language.

8

have 905(a)

9

benefits.

You

which basically says exclusively you get the
The employer is not to suffer any more manner

10

of making payments.

Section 905(b) reiterates this, it

11

says that the employer cannot be directly or indirectly

12

liable to the injured employee on behalf of the vessel.

13

If we look at Edmonds and we try to determine

14

the wav it was with Edmonds, then you are saying

15

basically that the injured employee can sue the vessel,

16

but in the same token if the vessel is owned by the

17

employer it is literally the employer that is making the

18

payments.

19

20

o it is really a way of getting around the
far as what 905(a) was , and it is our

21

that in 905(b), as the second pa rt of the

22

nee , whs re it says that the employer may not

23

be directly or indirectly liable to the employee for the

24

vessel, then they are in fact reiterating in 905(b) the

25

exclusivity provision that it had in 905(a).

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Going one step further in that same sentence

2

in section 905(b) it does make reference that if any

3

action can be filed by the injured employee, it would be

4

in accordance with section 933 of the same Act.

5

did not address itself to that particular section.

Edmonds

6

Section 933 of the Act sets forth that the

7

injured employee, if he determines that the injuries

8

were in fact caused by somebody other than the employer

9

or an employee of the employer, he has the right to a

10
11

third party action.
So I think you have in 905(a) and 905(b) and

12

933, you have three distinct places where the intent of

13

Congress was to limit any payments that the injured

14

employee would get from the employer to solely the

15

situation of receiving the compensation benefits.

16

The trade-offs, as I have indicated, if you

17

look at the legislative intent and the language which I

18

have cited in my brief, sets forth specifically that the

19

intent of the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Worker’s Act was

20

to place maritime workers in similar situations into the

21

same situation that a land-based employee has under

22

Workmen’s Compensation.

23

I believe the Court is well aware that in the

24

cases where we have a State Workemen*s Compensation law

25

that the employee who is injured does in fact have the

1C

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

right to get the benefits.

Under the Compensations Act,

2

he has no other benefits at that time.

3

to preclude him, as I feel the intent of 905(b) was, to

4

sue, let's say, the manufacturer of a machine upon which

5

he was injured as long as it was not owned by the

6

employe r.

There is nothing

So I think., in looking at the 1972 amendments,

7

8

when you put them all together without taking them out

9

of context, that you can see that the overall intent was

10

simply to put these longshoremen on the same basis of

11

land-based employees, to get only that type of benefit.
Now, 905(b) does also provide that somebody

12

13

who is injured, who is not an employee or not, can sue

14

somebody who has caused the injury, but again if there

15

is any liability or any money to be paid by the

16

employer, then they are not going to receive payments.
We had raised this contention in the

17
18

pleadings.

I had raised it as a motion for summary

19

judgment in the lower court, and of course the Third

20

Circuit looked at it, but this is the first time, I

21

believe, that this issue has been before this Court.

22

Although there has been discussion in Edmonds and in

23

other cases, I do feel that what we are looking at is a

24

situation that the intent of Congress was overwhelming

25

to limit the recovery that the longshoremen could get.

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

I might point out also that if we get this

1

2

interpretation, and also we are looking at minimizing

3

litigation costs, because I think if you look at the

4

true intent then the employees who are injured will, in

5

fact, be getting their compensation benefits which are

6

quite high under the circumstances of this Act, and

7

there is not going to be these types of actions which

8

are going to take up the time of the trial courts

9

largely.

You never contested the finding of the trial

MR. MURDOCH*

That is correct, that was not

raised, Justice O'Connor.

15

QUESTION;

All right.

16

MR. MURDOCH:

I would like to point out on

17

that, though, that the finding of negligence, if you

18

want to look at a dual capacity, was not made clear

19

because, although it was a finding of negligence as the

20

owner pro hac vice, it did not make a distinction as to

21

whether or not there was a finding of negligence as an

22

employer or as a vessel.

23

QUESTION:

And I think that is the

But for our purposes, we assume

that there was negligence as a vessel owner; right?

MR. MURDOCH:

1

No, I don't think we can assume

2

that.

I think that because it is unclear as to what the

court did, perhaps you have to assume that in order to

But we are not to pass on the issue

MB. MURDOCH:

That is correct, that was not

raised at the time of the argument.
If there are no other questions concerning

11

that question, I will go on to the second question.

12

second question was the standard of the measure of

13

damages which was decided by the lower court and then

14

affirmed by the Third Circuit.

15

The

In 1980, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court

16

decided the case of Kacskowski versus Bolubasc and in

17

that particular case they had adopted what had been

18

known as the Alaska Rule, which is basically the total

19

offset method.

20

In the total offset method, the lower court

21

assumed that any inflation which may arise in the future

22

would be the equivalent and be offset of any interest

23

rates, so that rather than discounting to the present

24

value, that whatever the value of lost future earnings

25

were going to be or the capacity of future earnings,

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

that was what the measure was.
In this particular case, as T stated before,

3

the lower court came to the conclusion based on a

4

worklife of

5

making $26,000 for those 12 years.

6

there was a finding that Mr. Pfeifer could do some

7

minimum wage, so that was projected over the worklife

8

expectancy and that was deducted in addition to the

9

workmen's or longshoremen's compensation benefits that

10

we had paid as of the date of the jury -- the non-jury

11

verdict, that was deducted.

12 years that Mr. Pfeifer would have been
In multiplying this

l

12

It is our position, as we told the lower court

13

and put in our post-findings of fact, that it was going

14

to be necessary -- in the event that there was a verdict

15

in favor of the plaintiff that there was going to have

16

to be a reduction to present work.

17

This was not done as it was just assumed, as I

18

state, that the inflation was going to offset the

19

interest rates and, therefore, whatever the figure

20

determined at that time was was going to be what the

21

plaintiff would get.

22

We submit to this honorable Court that this is

23

a decision upon which there is really no basis to make

24

this type of finding.

25

purpose of determining why we give a lump sum award, it

I think when we look at the

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is because the lump sum award, if it is given directly

2

to the plaintiff at the time of the trial, is going to

3

be worth much more after investing than it would be by

4

the reduction to present value, which is what this Court

5

set the standard to be in 1916 in the case of Chesapeake

6

versus Kelly.

7

Also as recently as 1980 in the case of LIFECO

8

there was the same reiteration that in order to arrive

9

at a full value, a fair figure for impairment of future

10

earnings or lost wages that there must be a reduction of

11

present worth.

12

and this is the only circuit which has adopted this

13

measure of damages in a Federal action, and we submit

14

that it should not be done so.

15

That was ignored by the Third Circuit

There have been many cases set forth in our

16

brief, and also in the briefs of the Amicus which have

17

filed on our behalf, setting forth the problems that

18

even economists have with making a determination as to

19

how to determine if in fact we are going to have

20

inflation and be able to project inflation at a

21

particular rate over a long time period.

22

I think with what we have seen in the economy

23

in the last three, four, five years with the spiraling

24

inflation rates, with the governmental steps to come in

25

and try to reduce inflation, with determining whether or

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

not we are in a recession or a depression, with all the

2

economic factors, the economists cannot even agree from

3

past events what caused those.

4

It has been held almost uniformly, although

5

there are some circuits which are making a distinction,

6

that inflation is too speculative to have somebody come

7

in and make an argument, give evidence to a fact-finder,

8

to project over a long time period.
Shat we are suggesting is that the proper

9
10

measure of damages would be to get back to what we still

11

call the traditional approach.

12

being that there can be evidence of a particular

13

category of individuals in a particular geographical

14

area, and there can be testimony of somebody to come in

15

as an economist to set forth that there would be a

16

likelihood of increased wages, but not to get into the

17

convoluted type of testimony that we have with

18

inflation.
2UESTI0Ni

19

The traditional approach

So under your view, you start with

20

the reduction of the award to present value, and then

21

permit it to be augmented by testimony as to increased

22

wages?

23

*R. MURDOCH*

I think

we would do it sort of

24

backwards, Justice Rehnguist.

We would have the

25

increases.

The fact for the particular occupation that

2

the plaintiff is involved in that there would be the

3

likelihood of increase of wages.
QUESTION:

4

So what the jury ought to do is to

5

consider that testimony as to future earnings, perhaps

6

higher wage rates or promotions in the future.

7

after they get the total award, they go through the

8

mechanics of reducing it to present value.
SB. MURDOCH:

9
10
11

Then

That is correct, Justice

Reh nquist.
We think this is the most fair because, I

12

think as litigators and being in and out of courts, one

13

of the things we want to do is to try to get the type of

14

testimony which is not going to be convoluted, which is

15

not going to increase the time of trial, the cost of

16

trial, and also put it on the basis that some

17

fact-finders or jurors can then make a decision as to

18

what they should give a person who is injured.

19

I think this is fair because one of the things

20

that we strive to do in courts is to make it a system

21

that is fair not only for the defendants but for the

22

plaintiffs.

23

inflation has not kept up with any increase as far as

24

interest rates are concerned.

25

The history has shown that any increase in

You have problems if you project, such as in

Kaczkowski,

the inflation, basically the inflation,

2

because you are going to assume then that even the

3

increases of salary are going to keep up with rates of

4

inflation.

5

the cases that we have cited, and that the Amici have

6

cited, that this just is not so.

I think that the past history has shown in

What I am suggesting, as I said, we want to

7

8

preclude the introduction of speculation which is

9

basically, as I say, convoluted, reduce it to present

10

worth.

11

interest rates are going to increase that the increase,

12

then, from the interest rates can be reinvested and this

13

would also benefit the plaintiff.

14

You have a built-in factor there that if

So I am not looking at a situation where we

15

are trying to cut down as far as what the plaintiff is

16

going to get, but to make it something that is workable

17

for the court system, fair to both parties, and still

18

something that can cut down on the litigation costs.

19

QUESTION;

The SG has filed a brief in this

20

case on the damages question suggesting, T think, a

21

different approach than you are suggesting if I

22

understand it correctly.

23

SR. MURDOCH!

24

QUESTION;

25

That is correct.

And one that would propose that

perhaps it's all right to consider the inflationary

19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

factors, both as applied, to the discount element and as

2

applied to the prospective wage increase.

3

suggesting that this Court shouldn't finally determine

4

as between some of the approaches now used which is

5

better.
HR. HUFDOCH;

6

But

As far as what they have

7

suggested, they were talking specifically about what

8

would be the Feldman case and the Doca case where they

9

had an adjusted discount rate.

I am not so sure that

10

they really did apply inflationary and non-inflationary

11

matters before they applied the discount rate at that

12

time.

13

One of the problems I have with their

14

approaches is that they do assume, in fact, that the

15

wages of those pa rticular plain tiffs lost, or their

16

earni ng capacity in the future. would have in fact kept

17

rat e , would have increased with inflation.

18

think that they can do that.

19

I don't

What I am suggesting is, I think, a better

20

situation because if you look at the Feldman case, they

21

had 1.5 percent discount rate.

22

discount rate.

23

Court of Appeals specifically said, we are not

24

suggesting that it be this 2 percent, it might be 3

25

percent or it might be u percent.

Doca had a 2 percent

But I believe in the Doca case, the

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

There are other approaches set forth in the

1

2

other briefs which were filed on our behalf.

3

that the discussion does show that the inflation factor

4

should not be part of the testimony.

5

court should look at the vitality of Kelly and reaffirm

6

it in light of this particular question.

7

I do think

I think that this

What I would be concerned about is that, as we

8

look at the uniformity provision of one and the same

9

type of standards to look at in all the circuits, that

10

this honorable Court is certainly going to have to make

11

some determination as to what guidelines would be.

12

most, we would suggest that the Koczkowski case, or the

13

total offset method which was adopted in this case, be

14

overturned because there is no precedent for it, there

15

is no evidence for it.

19

I think it is improper.

If there are no other questions, I would like

I have a question, Fr. Kurdoch, if

I may.

MR. KURDCCHs

21

QUESTION!

Yes, sir.

The calculation of the award in

explain how they the $275,000.

25

I have two questions

Did they not subtract from, in the

the Longshoremen's Act?

3

MR. MURDOCH;

4

QUESTION;

5

SR. MURDOCH;

No, they didn’t.

Why not, I don’t understand.
The 533,000 which is subtracted

there was the compensation payments we had made from the

7

date of injury —

8

QUESTION;

9

MR. MURDOCH;
QUESTION;

10

Right.
-- to the date of trial.

Why wouldn't they also -- If they

11

subtracted an amount for the minimum wage, why wouldn't

12

they also subtract -- Was that or maybe that wasn't

13

raised?

14
15

MR. MURDOCH;

I am sorry.

The minimum wage.

Justice Stevens, which was deducted was $66,000.

16

QUESTION:

Correct.

17

MR. MURDOCH:

18

QUESTION;

Then the $33,000.

But the minimum wage, this $66,000,

19

as I understand it, is the minimum he would have earned

20

in the future.

21

MR. MURDOCH:

22

QUESTION;

23
24
25

Over the 12 years, yes, sir.

Why wouldn't they also subtract 12

years of future workmen's compensation payments?
MR. MURDOCH;

What the Court indicated was

going to happen was that if in fact there was going to

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

be an appeal at the time there was a final decision in

2

this case, that we would then make a determination as to

3

what had been paid at that time.

4

What happens from a practical standpoint is

5

that if a lump sum award is going to be given to Hr.

6

Pfeifer, no further payments are made at that time.

7

QUESTION i

I see.

8

HR. MURDOCH;

9

QUESTION;

We are given credit for that.

Then my next question is, is there

10

any place in the papers a calculation similar to this of

11

what your expert or what your position in the trial

12

court was as to the proper award?

13

MR. MURDOCH;

No, there was not much evidence

QUESTION;

If you did not offer evidence that

19

in this case the award would have been lower under your

20

theory, how do you have standing -- I don*t understand

21

whether there you have a standing to claim of reversible

22

error on the damages.

23

MR. MURDOCH;

We argued at the time, not only

24

in proposed findings of fact but durina the trial, that

damages which were going to be awarded that there would

2

have to be the reduction to present worth.

3
4
5

QUESTIONS

Did you offer evidence showing what

that would have produced?
MR. MURDOCHS

No, we didn't.

We felt that

6

that was the burden of the plaintiff.

7

the court would come in and apply what we felt was the

8

proper standard of damages.

9

QUESTIONS

We felt that if

It seems to me that it is at least

10

theoretically possible that your approach would have

11

produced a higher damage award and if that is the case --

12

MR. MURDOCHS

I don't believe so because

13

traditionally in Pennsylvania there has been a reduction

14

to 6 percent.

15

QUESTION:

Just looking at the record in this

16

case, can we be sure that you would have been better off

17

under your theory?

18
19

MR. MURDOCHS

You have nothing in the record

before you on that.

I would like to reserve whatever time I have.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEROME M. LIBFNSON, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. LIBENSONs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

please the Court
There are two issues in this case.

2

The first

3

is whether a longshoreman may sue his employer for

4

negligence as a vessel owner unier 905(h) of the

5

Longshoremen’s and Harbor Worker’s Compensation Act.

6

will refer to this as the Act as I go through my

7

argument.

8

properly calculated damages on the record before it.

9

Both these issues were affirmed in the lower court in

The second is whether the lower court

favor of my client, the Respondent.
The Longshoremen’s and Harbor Worker's

12

Compensation Act was passed in 1927, but it was

13

significantly amended in 1972 to add 905(b) for the

14

first time.

15

to bring an action against a vessel as a third party in

16

negligence instead of unseaworthiness which was the

17

previous method of claim.

18

905(b) put into statutory form permission

As Justice C'Connor pointed out, the

19

Petitioner, J&L’s negligence in its ownership capacity

20

is not before this Court.

21

that it was owner pro hac vice of all the barges in the

22

fleet on January 13, 1978, when Howard Pfeifer was

23

injured, when he slipped on an accumulation of snow and

24

ice on a gunnel.

25

Furthermore, JCL admitted

I don’t know if the Court is familiar with how

The point is that of the 35 barges that were

9

not they actually did own them or not.

However, J£L

10

would have you treat this case differently if my client

11

fell on an unowned barge in the same fleet, which is

12

contrary to the intent of the Act.

13

Under 905(b) all longshoremen are to be

23

the fact of their ownership of the vessel.

24
25

The incidence of their being an

I submit to you that the award in this case
should not depend on the gratuitous event or

1

happenstance of how or where a person happens to fall if

2

he is going to be injured.

3

The 1972 amendments to this Act were brought

4

about because of this Court's finding in Seas Shipping

5

against Sieracki and in the Lyon case.

6

period between 1927 and 1972, the practice was for a

7

vessel to ask for an indemnity agreement from any

8

stevedore company, and the effect was that any injury or

9

claim against the vessel under unseaworthiness was paid

During the

10

finally by the stevedore company under the indemnity

11

agreement.

12

Congress felt that this was improper.

In

13

passing the amendments in 1972, it took away the

14

unseaworthiness doctrine, the indemnity provisions, and

15

it expanded the Act by increasing the benefits.

16

also in effect ratified Reed against The Yakka and

17

Jackson which this Court had passed, and permitted a

18

suit against the vessel itself under 905(b).

19

But it

1

their employer is an independent stevedore or a

2

shipowner stevedore.

3

the same whether they are independent or an arm of the

4

shipowner itself.

All stevedores are to be treated

Justice White further cited the congressional

5

6

hearing reports and stated in footnote 12 in his opinion

7

that "Congress ultimately decided to preserve the

8

longshoremen's tort action against shipowners acting as

9

shipowners."
The legislative goal of passing 905(b) was the

10
11

safety of the longshoremen, and the committee reports

12

say that "The Committee recognized the progress that has

13

been made in reducing injury in the longshoring

14

industry, but longshoring remains one of the most

15

hazardous types of occupation, and the Committee expects

16

to see further progress in reducing injuries and stands

17

ready to immediately reexamine the third party

18

question."
The point is that Congress felt that by

19

20

preserving the action against the vessel, it would have

21

a salutary effect on the vessels to ensure their

22

safety.

23

There are six Circuit Courts that have

24

addressed this question since the 1972 amendments have

25

been in effect, and all of them have arrived at a

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

finding that is in conformity with Griffith and the

2

results in this case.
I believe that this Court, speaking through

3
4

Justice Powell in Pfeifer, stated that this was a

5

remedial statute, and the amendments were made out of

6

solicitude for the workers.

7

recently, since the filing of our brief, in Director

8

againt Perrini, cited the committee reports for

9

authority as to what the Act meant.

Justice O’Connor very

I think if this

10

Court will again refer to the Act and committee reports,

11

they should have no problem with 905(b).

12

Congress's intent was to treat all

13

longshoremen alike, whether employed by an independent

14

stevedore or shipowner stevedore and to impose liability

15

on shipowner stevedores for negligence in their

16

ownership capacity.

To deny Pfeifer's recovery due to the mere

in negligence for the injuries to my client under

905(b).
The question of damages and the proper method

13
14

of determining damages is also before this Court.
First of all, I would point to the Court, as

15
16

Justice Stevens has asked, there is a complete waiver on

17

the part of the petitioner to raise this question.
The local rules of the District Court in which

18
19

this was tried require any expert testimony to be

proffered in the pretrial statement with a report from

the expert, and before an expert is permitted to

QUESTION:

He didn't do that .

I realize that, but do you think

that the Defendant would be prevented from urging on

of damages simply because the Defendant —

20

MR. LIBENSON;

You are presupposing, Justice

21

Rehnquist, that he went outside the record which he did

22

not do, and that is my point.

23

QUESTION:

But the rule, the law of damages

24

doesn't necessarily depend on the record.

It is a body

25

of law that you find in cases and not in the record of

1

this case
MR. LIBENSON:

2

I would like to — If I could

3

answer your question by directing your attention or

4

inviting your attention to the Alma case against

5

Manufacturers Hanover Trust in the Ninth Circuit, which

6

stated that in the absence of evidence on the reduction

7

by either side, the Court is not obligated to go ahead

8

sue sponte to do it.
QUESTIONS

9
10

But the Third Circuit did go ahead

here and considered various rules of damages.
MR. LIBENSON:

11

I think the Third Circuit did

12

essentially what the Ninth Circuit did in Alma, it

13

addressed the record in front of it and what it did was

14

say that whether or not the Longshoremen's and Harbor

15

Worker’s Compensation Act considered inflation and

16

whether or not there was Federal law as precedent at

17

that time.

18

Shoremen Act, does not have a treble damage

19

requirement.

My point is that the Act itself, unlike the

It has no requirement as to damages.

QUESTIONS

20

But the Third Circuit, unless I

21

wholly misread its opinion, affirmatively adopted a

22

rather sweeping change in the law of damages in this

23

kind of case at least for that circuit.

24

that?

25

MR. LIBENSON:

Do you dispute

I don't dispute it but I think

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the answer is that there was no law of damages in a

2

fixed manner at that time.

3

was evolve, if you will, Federal common law like any

4

other common law that is evolved.
QUESTION:

5

What the Third Circuit did

But it certainly wasn't a rule of

damages applicable to only these particular facts and

sweeping rule, whether there was a preceding rule or

not.

That is true, but I think there

17

was room for it because there was nothing in the Federal

18

law at that time that directed them any other way.
QUESTION:

But now it is the law of the Third

20

Circuit.

21

been correct in doing it, but I am suggesting that your

22

argument about waiver really has little bearing in -view

23

of what the Third Circuit did.

24
25

I am not suggesting that they may not have

MR. LIBENSONi

My argument -- The waiver goes

to the fact that I don’t think the petitioner can ask

for a reduction to present worth at this point in time

2

because it is not in the record, that is my point, Your

3

Honor.
QUESTION;

4

If the rule, the yardstick that the

5

Third Circuit applied is not warranted and justified,

6

what about that?
MR. IIBENSON;

7

If they had other evidence

8

before it from which they could argue, but to say that

9

it is not warranted —
QUESTION;

10
11

Isn't that just a matter of

evidence?

12

HR. LIBENSON;

13

QUESTION;

14
15

That is right, Your Honor.

Don't you think that they made a

new rule?
HR. LIBENSON;

I don't think they were

16

entitled to make a new rule under the state of the law

17

as it was before them at th e time that this case was

18

presented to them.

19

they took the case. Your Ho nor -- Hr. Chief Justice.

QUESTION;

I think that is one of the reasons

The gu estion is whethe r made the

correct rule of law on meas uring damages, i s it not.

22

MR. LIBENSON;

23

QUESTION;

I am sorry, I didn *t hear.

Whethe r they made the correct rule

of law to measure the damag es, and that is a question of

law and not a question of f act.

That is true, but a law evolves

from facts and I think, a court has to have facts in

QUESTION*

On what facts do you think the

Third Circuit evolved, to use your term, their rule?
MR. LIBENSONs

All right.

I think they

7

utilized the unique situation in this case that there

8

was no precedent governing Federal law of damages, other

9

than Chesapeake and Ohio.

10

The case -- the Pfeifer case in the Third

11

Circuit opinion comports with Chesapeake and Ohio

12

against Kelly, a 1916 case, because the set off of

13

inflation against reduction to present worth in effect

14

is a reduction.

15

and the Third Circuit also said that this case, in their

16

opinion, conforms to Chesapeake and Ohio against Kelly.

17

That is what the Third Circuit said,

QUESTION:

Does this involve an assumption

18

that inflation is always going to remain in the state

19

that it is on the day or at the time the Court of

20

Appeals is evolving its new rule?

21

MR. LIBENSON:

I think that the history of

22

inflation is recognized by all circuits at this point,

23

but the First.

24

knows that inflation has been present since at least

25

1950 and has been increasing.

I think that everyone on this bench

It is a problem that has

It is a different issue, but T

But also, I think, the Court should consider

So the concept of the total offset method has many

8

As a matter of fact, at this point in time, I

9

think between the various circuits that have considered

10

it,

you have possibly four different concepts.

You have

11

cases, in Doca, in Feldman, or O'Shea, where the various

12

Courts have said that there is a real rate of interest

13

which is anywhere from 1.5 to 2 to 3 percent.
There is a series of cases where the Court

14
15

just lets it to the jury to consider what inflation is.

16

There is a series of cases that reguires expert

17

testimony.

18

four wrestle with the same problem as to what is the

19

method, but I think they illustrate that any one method

20

is just not exclusive.

21

Then there is the total offset method.

All

I think that this Court, if it attempted to

22

say that there is one method that is superior to the

23

others, would only run into additional problems on other

24

aspects of damages that would not hold water.

25

The only question that the Third Circuit

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

really answered in its opinion was that they held that

2

the District Court did not err in computing damages for

3

future loss of earnings — this is on 16a of the

4

petition for certiorari — because it is not necessary

5

to go through the process of discounting lump sum awards

at theoretical present values.

7

presumed egual to the offset by the impact of inflation

8

on the future economic value of the award.

The discount factor is

standpoint.

QUESTION*

Is it a fair interpret ation to say

10

that all the Court of Appeals was saying it was not an

11

abuse of discretion for the District Court to have

12

applied this rule, intimating that perhaps if the

13

District Court had applied another rule, it would have

14

affirmed it, too.

15

HR. LIBENSON*

I think so.

16

But I think that Judge Aldisert i n writing

17

this opinion felt that inflation had to be addressed,

18

obviously, from the contents of the opinion , and he felt

19

that this method, if it is going to be addr essed, is

superior to anything else that has been uti lized in the

various circuits.

S te vens.
QUESTION;

9

Mere any arguments made to any of

10

the courts along the line that something like a cost of

11

living adjustment could be built into an award?
MR. LIBENSONs

12

Your Honor, in the record in

13

this case, cost of living increases were submitted to

14

the District Court that were known under the various -~

15

under the union contract, however; and that is the

16

reason, on page 21 of my brief, I was able to

17

demonstrate that if you add in the cost of living

18

increases that were known up to the time of the trial

19

and then reduce them by the 2 percent method under the

20

Doca case, you would still come up with about an $80,000

21

higher verdict than was obtained in this case.

22

Cohill felt that the Kaczkowski case or the Alaska rule

23

of total offset was appropriate and he applied it in

24

this case.

I hope that answers your question.

MR. LIBENSONi

I think this Court did address

prediction is not anything precise.

5

the court is looking for a precise and totally accurate

7

The problem is if

I think the question is, if you are looking

8

for a method that is appropriate for most cases and

9

which should be followed, I commend the total offset

method to you because, again, it is comprehensible,

efficient, and inexpensive.

You will avoid the necessity of expert witnesses.

It is something for a jury

May I ask you one other question.

18

The government comes up with two proposals, both of

19

which differ from the total offset method.

20

in believing that both of those which do in a sense take

21

inflation into account — both of those represent a

22

change in the law at least as it was, let's say, ten

23

years ago, a rather dramatic change in the law?

24
25

MR. LIBENSON:

Am I correct

I think the question of

inflation itself represents the change.

11

MR. LIBENSON*

I might add that the total

culpable party, at that point he has already established

his liability.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. MURDOCH, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. MURDOCH;

7

Thank you, Chief Justice Burger,

8

and may it please the Court.

9

several points which were raised in Mr.

10
11

I would like to cover
Libenson's

argument.
I would respectfully disagree that by having

12

the amendments of 1972 that the Reed versus The Yakka

13

case was overruled.

14

interpretation, putting 905(a),

15

together, would indicate again, without getting back

16

into my argument, that all actions against a vessel or

17

an employer are completely devoid due to these

18

amendments and, therefore, I feel the negligence actions

19

which are allowed under 905(b) are for a longshoreman or

20

anyone covered under the Act against somebody other than

21

the employer.

22

I feel that if in my
905(b), and 933

As to the payments that come under the

23

workmen’s compensation benefits, such as we have in this

24

case, I believe that one of the intents, one of the

25

purposes that we have in the workmen's compensation

individual who was injured.

3

We have two dangers if this type of action is

which is going to be paid with the stopping of the

compensation payments.

7

anybody who receives a lump sum payment such as this is

8

going to retain it or have the wise investment

10

First of all, it requires a lump sum payment,

There is no guarantee that

So I think that it is something that should be
with the purpose to allow the monetary

go against that particular intent.

14
15

QUESTIONS

Are you suggesting that ad hoc

evaluations could be appropriately made?

16

MR. MURDOCH;

Yes, I believe they could.

17

As to the total offset method, I would like to

18

raise something as an example in order to show exactly

19

what we are involved with with the total offset method.

20

If we assume that the finding of the Court would be that

21

the lost earning capacity in the future would be

22

$180,000 for that particular plaintiff, what the total

23

offset method does is provide $180,000 in that

individual's pocket at that time.
