CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

2
3

whenever you are ready.
MR. FARR:

4
5

Mr. Farr, I think you may proceed

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it

please the Court:
This case returns to this Court after a two-year

6
7

absence.

As the Court will recall, in 1978, the District Court,

8

relying on federal constitutional, federal statutory, and

9

state statutory grounds, ordered that Pennhurst State School and

10

Hospital, a facility for the mentally retarded, be closed and

11

that all of its residents be moved to community living alter­

12

natives known as CLAs.

13

On appeal, the Third Circuit, relying on the Develop-

14

m.ental Disability Act, the federal statute not relied on by the

15

District Court, essentially affirmed the judgment.

16

modify the order, however, to allow some residents to remain at

17

Pennhurst.

18
19

20

QUESTION:

It did

You will at some point address the question

of mootness, possible mootness, will you not?
MR. FARR:

The question of mootness, Mr. Chief

21

Justice, goes to the particular issue of the Special Master and

22

Alan Warshaw will discuss that issue.

23

if you would prefer.

24
25

I will discuss it first

The Third Circuit, on the initial appeal, ordered the
District Court to make individual determinations about the
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

appropriateness of an improved Pennhurst for each resident.

2

It further ordered the District Court or. Master to apply

3

a presumption in favor of placing people in CLA's and said that

4

unless Pennhurst was the only appropriate place for a resident

5

"CLA's must be provided."
This Court reversed, finding that the DD Act\ did not

6
7

impose such massive obligations on the states.

8

the case to the Third Circuit for consideration of the other

9

issues.

10
11

It then remanded

On remand, the Third Circuit issued exactly the same
order, this time resting its decision entirely on state law.

12

The Court rejected our argument that the 11th Amendment

13

barred the order and, furthermore, that in the event the 11th

14

Amendment did not bar it, the principles of Comity should do so.

15

As a result we believe that the Third Circuit has

16

expanded the power of the federal courts at the expense of

17

state officials, state legislatures, and ultimately, state courts.

18

Now, as I have explained, Mr. Chief Justice, I will

19

particularly address the 11th Amendment issues on which there is

20

no mootness point,, and Allen Warshaw will discuss the other

21

issues .

22

Before turning to the merits of the 11th Amendment

23

issue, I would like to talk briefly about the relationship

24

between the

25

Jurisdiction. For the Third Circuit, in rejecting our 11th

11th Amendment and the Doctrine of Pendent

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Amendment argument, placed considerable weight on the fact that

2

the state law claim, on which all of the relief now rests, was

3

a pendent claim.

4

Our position on this issue is straightforward.

The

5

Doctrine of Pendent Jurisdiction is not sufficient to override

6

a constitutional bar like the 11th Amendment any more than the

7

excerise of diversity jurisdiction or admirality jurisdiction

8

or any other general grant of jurisdiction would be able to do

9

so.

10

For example, it would be inconceivable if the original

11

claim in Chisholm v. Georgia, the very claim that prompted the

12

passage of the 11th Amendment, could now be brought after the

13

passage of the 11th Amendment in federal court simply by making

14

it a pendent claim rather than a diversity claim as it was in

15

Chisholm.

16

Without a valid basis of jurisdiction under Article

17

III, of course, the issue of the 11th Amendment is never reached,

18

but once valid jurisdiction under Article III is found, the

19

question still must be answered, is a particular claim barred

20

by the 11th Amendment?

21

QUESTION:

How do you distinguish the holding of

22

this Court about the 11th Amendment in Green v. Louisville

23

Railroad case?

24
25

MR. FARR:

The decision in Green does not ever

address the question specifically, of course, as to whether
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

the pendent claim has to be examined under the 11th Amendment.

2

I think that holding has been seriously undercut by the holding

3

in Edelman, which the Court decided ten years ago.

4

the Court did exactly what we are saying they should do in this

5

case. It first looked to see whether the Court properly excerised

6

pendent jurisdiction, citing Hagans v. Lavine, the leading case.

7

In Edelman

It then, however, having found that the Court did properly

8

excerise pendent jurisdiction, went on to conclude that the

9

claim was barred by the 11th Amendment.

10
11
12

Now, to the extent that Green is inconsistent with
that, we think Edelman is already undercut.
QUESTION:

Edelman did involve just a federal statutory

13

claim with what relief was ultimately granted on it, wasn't it?

14

It was not a state claim.

15
16
17

MR. FARR:

That is correct.

I think it is important

though to keep these two issues separately.
Our position here is that the excerise of pendent

18

jurisdiction does not affect whether the claim is barred by the

19

11th Amendment.

20

Amendment, then the excerise of pendent jurisdiction doesn't

21

make any difference.

22

If you find that it is barred by the 11th

Now, the second part of my argument, of course, is that

23

this claim, although it is not a federal statutory claim, is

24

barred by the 11th Amendment.

25

QUESTION:

And, why it is barred?

Because it is

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

i

1

against the state?

2

MR. FARR:

In this particular case, yes.

The short

3

answer, and I have a longer answer that I will give, the short

4

answer is that it is a claim against the state and it is not

5

taken outside of the 11th Amendment by the unusual principles

6

of Ex Parte Young that apply only when —

7

QUESTION:

So, you really aren't saying that the 11th

8

Amendment always bars the adjudication in the federal court

9

of a pendent claim ‘where

10

the nominal defendants — or where

the defendants are state officers?

11

MR. FARR:

That is correct.

12

QUESTION:

You don't say — You are saying it always

MR. FARR:

No.

13
14

bars that?
I am saying that it does not always

15

bar it where the defendants are state officials.

16

Under 11th Amendment law —

17

QUESTION:

The defendants here are state officials?

18

MR. FARR:

The defendants here are state officials

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

and there —
QUESTION:

So, you have to get to some more — You

must say something else about the 11th Amendment.
MR. FARR:

I have lots more to say about it, yes,

Your Honor.
But, the fact is, one of the key principles, which I
will discuss, about the 11th Amendment is that the fact that
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

you make state officials the nominal defendants doesn't mean that

2

it isn't in practice a claim against the state for 11th Amendment

3

purposes.

4

QUESTION:

Let me go back if I may.

I am not sure I

5

understood your answer to Justice O'Connor about the two Green

6

cases that Judge Seitz relied upon in the Third Circuit.

7

said they have been implicitly overruled by Edelman against

8

Jordan, is that your —

9

MR. FARR:

Right.

You

I think to the extent you were

10

talking about the particular part of Green, which it never

11

really discusses — It never discusses tHe relationship.

12

QUESTION:

No, the holding is inconsistent with —

13

MR. FARR:

But, the holding, as it goes to state

14
15

officials, is inconsistent with Edelman.
I would like to point out that Green and Siler, which is;

16

the case that the Third Circuit relied on, of course, didn't

17

even discuss the 11th Amendment issue.

18

But, those cases were decided at a time when the

19

federal intrusion into state affairs was much greater than is

20

now recognized to be permissible.

21

about a time of substantive due process, Lochner v. New York.

22

Those cases have essentially been legislatively overruled by

23

the Anti-Injunction Acts, therefore, the court really hasn't

24

had a chance to reconsider them.

25

QUESTION:

You know, we are talking

But, your answer — I still want to be sure,
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

your answer is that they have been implicity overruled by Edelman

2

against Jordan.

3

My next question is how could cases that turn on

4

state law claim be overruled by Edelman against Jordan which did

5

not involve the state law claim?

6

MR. FARR:

Well, Edelman v. Jordan, of course, doesn't

7

discuss the issue of whether — I mean, does not address the

8

issue of whether the particular claim at issue in Green would be

9

barred by the 11th Amendment, but it does address the issue of

10

whether if a pendent claim is barred by the 11th Amendment and

11

I think there are different reasons for different types of

12

claims.

13

difference.

14

as if it is a pendent claim as it would be if it was —

Then, the fact that it is a pendent claim makes no

15

QUESTION:

And vice versus too.

16

MR. FARR:

Pardon me?

QUESTION:

And, equally — the converse would equally

the fact that —

QUESTION:

22

is a pendent claim?

23

MR. FARR:

That is correct.

24

QUESTION:

All right.

25

MR. FARR:

Now, I obviously should get to the 11th

It .doesn't become barred simply because it

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Amendment principles and while the Court has said itself that its

2

decisions in this area are not easy to reconcile, I think there

3

are four principles which are pretty clearly established by now.

4

First of all, the 11th Amendment does bar suits against

5

a state by its own citizens as well as by citizens of another

6

state.

7

it last term in Treasure Salvors.

8
9

The Court said that in Hans v. Louisiana.

It reaffirmed

Second, that the Amendment also bars suits for
injunctive relief —

10

QUESTION:

That is not unanimous.

11

MR. FARR:

Pardon me?

12

QUESTION:

That is not unanimous.

13

MR. FARR:

That is correct, Justice Rehnquist.

14

The second principle is that the Amendment bars suits,

15

not just for damages, but for injunctive: relief as well.

16

Court reaffirmed that principle last term in Cory v. White and

17

the language of the 11th Amendment referring to any suit in law

18

or equity would leave little doubt.

19

The

The third principle, and the one which Justice White

20

was alluding to earlier, the Amendment bars suits against the

21

states, not just in name, but in fact.

22

Although the Court took awhile to get around to that

23

holding, originally holding that the state had to be named as

24

a defendant, it is now clear, from the cases of this Court,

25

that the Plaintiffs could not get around the 11th Amendment
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

by naming state officials as the nominal defendants.

2

cases, as in this one, the Court must look to the nature of the

3

claim asserted and the nature of the relief granted to determine

4

whether the state is, in fact, the real party in interest.

5

In such

Now, the fourth principle is the principle of Ex Parte

6

Young which, where applicable, puts a limitation on the second

7

and third principles just discussed.

8
9

According to that principle, a federal court may allow
injunctive relief against a state official and may do so even

10

if the result is to cause an expenditure of state funds.

11

reason for this exception, as stated in Young, is that a state

12

has no power to impart to a state official any immunity from

13

responsibility to the supreme authority of the Constitution.

The

14

Thus, where there is a conflict with the Constitution

15

or with supreme federal law, it is not necessary to ask, as you

16

do in the normal case, whether the state official is acting

17

within his colorable authority or whether the impact of the order

18

is on the state treasury because it makes no difference.

19

state cannot confer an immunity from obedience to the Constitutiori.

20

Now, while the logic of Ex Parte Young has been

The

21

questioned, the doctrine of the case has long been thought

22

necessary to the federal system, for without it, the ability

23

of the federal courts to enforce federal rights would be greatly

24

undercut.

25

that purpose.

But, the doctrine has been severely limited to suit

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

For example, the Court has declined to extend Ex Parte

2

Young to allow damages payable from a state treasury even though

3

the claim is a constitutional one and the logic of Ex Parte Young

4

conceivably could be stretched to fit that case.

5

Here, there is even less reason —

6

QUESTION:

7

What is the authority for that last

proposition?

8

MR. FARR:

9

Here, there is even less reason to extend Ex Parte

Edelman v. Jordan and cases before it.

10

Young because the claim at issue is not a federal claim at

11

all.

12

or with supreme federal law.

13

whether the defendants are correctly carrying out their

14

responsibilities under state law.

15

question that has anything to do with the principles of Ex Parte

16

Young.

17
18
19

It does not involve any conflict with the Constitution

QUESTION:

It involves only the question

That is not the sort of

So you say it must be then considered a

suit against the state?
MR. FARR:

Well, you have to make the examination to

20

determine whether it is a suit against the state.

21

case, I think if you apply the principles that you do in a

22

normal case, it clearly is a suit against the state.

23

QUESTION:

In this

But, if the argument only is whether the

24

officer is properly carrying out his duties, duties which he

25

has the authority to perform —
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. FARR:

Absolutely.

2

QUESTION:

— then it is a suit against the state.

3

MR. FARR:

That is a suit against the state if that,

4

in fact, is what the claim is and that is what the claim is here,

5

that is a suit against the state.

10

There obviously can be suits

But, what if the court alleged that the

It is just outside the perimeter of his duties.
MR. FARR:

The lesson of Larson and Treasure Salvors

11

last year is that there is some range outside of colorable authori ty

12

where you can't fairly say the official is acting as an official.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

But, this state — This case doesn't get

into that ring?
MR. FARR:

It certainly doesn't seem to me that it

16

does at all.

17

that there is a statutory bar of the type suggested in Larson

18

that had to be pleaded in the complaint that limits the power

19

of these officials to make placement decisions regarding

20

institutions or CLA's or any of the professional decisions

21

regarding treatment of the retarded.

22

You are talking here — There isn't any question

The most that the Respondents say is that they are

23

not carrying out their duties in the way that they should.

24

the Court in Larson has said that a mere error in the excerise

25

of duties is not enough to override a governmental immunity.

But,

QUESTION:

Do you conceive, then,

that you have to

colorable action distinction?

3

MR. FARR: We certainly think that that is one of the

4

distinctions that the Court has to look at in deciding whether

5

the suit is a suit against the state.

6

even if the Court did determine that it was ultra vires,

7

the Court would still have to look at the nature of the relief

8

granted here.

9

However, in this case,
we thin

case back in the class of suits that are cases against the state.

18

Ex Parte Young and about 50 or more other cases.

win?

21

22

MR. FARR:

25

I do not think you have to agree with every

one of the little points.

23

Do we have to

I think the basic points —

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

the point that this is, in fact, a suit against the state under the

2

accepted principles of these decisions.

3

QUESTION:

Do you want us to overrule Ex Parte Young?

4

MR. FARR:

Oh, absolutely not.

This case is entirely

5

consistent with Ex Parte Young.

6

Ex Parte Young is completely authoritative where it applies.

7

where it applies is when

All you have is an issue of whether these state officials are

10

carrying out their duties properly under state law, and that is

11

not the kind of claim when any of the immunity that is discussed

12

in Ex Parte Young can be set aside.

13

QUESTION:

May I just ask you a question to be sure I

14

get your theory correctly?

15

federal claim and the state claim — either federal statute or

16

federal Constitution, I would not care — but both asking for

17

precisely the same relief that you are discussing here.

18

as the claim relied on federal law, in your view, would it be a

19

claim against the state?

20

MR. FARR:

Supposing we had before us both the

Insofar

Insofar as the claim relied on federal law,

21

applying the principles of Ex Parte Young, the state could not

22

confer any immunity on the state officials.

23

a state official that was a named defendant, the claim would be

24

properly brought in state court against the state official under

25

federal law.

So, assuming it was

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

QUESTION:

That does not answer my question.

My question

is, insofar as it relied on federal law, would the claim be a claim

8

QUESTION:

I know you are saying they could maintain

9
10

11

the claim, but I am asking you as a matter of analysis whether,
in your view, it would be a claim against the state?
MR. FARR:

As a matter of analysis, the effect is the

12

same as it is in the claim of the state court.

13

Ex Parte Young says it does not make any difference in that case

14

whether it is the state —

15

QUESTION:

But, the logic of

You are saying that Ex Parte Young in

16

essence holds, even though it is a claim against the state, it

17

may be maintained notwithstanding the 11th Amendment?

18
19

20

MR. FARR:

That is the practical effect of Ex Parte

Young, yes.
QUESTION:

Yes, but you would say even if this were a

21

federal claim that the relief granted in this case would be

22

barred by the 11th Amendment in a federal court?

23

MR. FARR:

No, we are saying that in this case if the

24

relief were granted on a federal :claim, that for those purposes

25

Ex Parte Young would be the controlling case.

And, that does

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

allow prospective relief against state officials.

2
3

QUESTION:

You mean Edelman v. Jordan would not bar

that kind of relief granted in this case?

4

MR. FARR:

Edelman v. Jordan deals with retroactive

5

relief, not prospective relief.

6

think that Edelman v. Jordan would not bar relief, if the relief

7

was on a federal claim, which it is not.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

That is correct.

So, I would

So there is — so you do say that the 11th

Amendment should apply differently to a federal claim and to a
state pendent claim?

11

MR. FARR:

Absolutely.

I think Ex Parte Young establish es

12

an exception for federal claims that does not apply to state

13

claims precisely.

14

QUESTION:

The practical consequence this is with a

15

mixed claim, it would be the duty, in your view, of the federal

16

court to address the federal claim first?

17

MR. FARR:

Indeed, it would be the duty of the federal

18

court to address only the federal claim, because our argument is

19

that the state claim must be dismissed under the 11th Amendment.

20

Thank you.

QUESTION:

matter of

And, in addition, I would note that this Court has

recently counseled federal courts to show a substantial deference

25

Each of these principles was violated in this case

by the Third Circuit as it apparently soley or primarily, for

2

reasons of federal court convenience, sanctioned a massive and

3

ongoing intrusion into Pennsylvania's domestic policies, its

4

fiscal operations and the judgments of its qualified mental

5

retardation professionals.

6

Specifically, in this case the lower courts have taken

7

a vague right to treatment in the least restrictive environment,

8

and have assumed the power to apply it in over a thousand cases.

9

More importantly, they have taken this supposed right from state

10

cases involving one person where funding was not an issue and

11

have tried to apply it on a state-wide basis where limited

12

resources required difficult choices between competing needs,

13

rights, and priorities.

found wholly unacceptable — and I quote its word — the state

officials excuse and explanation that they had expended available

22

funds moving the residents of another institution into CLAs.

23

so doing it apparently found entirely irrelevant uncontroverted

its conditions were dangerously deteriorating.

It was about to

lose federal approval, and it was about to lose substantial
federal funding.
In contrast, Pennhurst at that time and today has full
federal approval, meets all applicable federal standards, and
receives substantial federal funding.

More recently, the Court

has ordered the state to place over 270 class members in CLAs.

It

has done so despite clear evidence that anticipating funding ‘
would not be sufficient to fund those placements.
It also ignored testimony by state officials that there
were simply priorities in the mental retardation area that should
have been given higher priority.

Thus, the District Court has

imposed its policy, fiscal and professional judgment on defendants
in a way which is given precedence to its decree to the exclusion
of all other competing interests in Pennsylvania.

Moreover, it

has done so without any regard for the many other mentally retarde
people in Pennsylvania whose right is presumably identical and
whose need was apparently greater.
This already massive intrustion has been exacerbated
by the appointment of Masters, who over a five-year period at a
cost of over $3,000,000 have monitored and supervised in detail
and on a daily basis the operation of Pennsylvania's programs
for the mentally retarded.

That has stopped, so what is

left of that?

there is a Hearing Master in place who resolves all disputes

concerning community placements.

improper, I take it the state could probably recover whatever

was paid to the Master.

MR. WARSHAW:

That would be our feeling.

And, at the

very least there is a Contempt citation which is pending before
this Court, if money is still at issue.

And, there is some issue about who has to

12

pay for those services rendered?

MR. WARSHAW:

Uh-huh.
There has been no question.

We have paid

bade us from paying state monies for that purpose, which is the

18

subject of a Contempt also pending before the Court.

19

it is 81-2363 in a Cert Petition which is pending.

20

I believe

Yes, there have been substantial monies at issue, and

21

at least Judge Garth in the lower court recognized that should

22

we prevail on the Master issue, we would certainly be entitled,

23

in a very real way, to the $300,000 which are still in the

24

custody of the District Court as a result of the Contempt fines.

25

Moreover, I should note that there are requests
21

pending in the District Court to reinstate the Master.

2

fact, throughout the course of this litigation, there have been

3

so many disputes over implementation, I cannot imagine that if

4

this case were to be remanded in its present form that the

5

District Court would not be asked on a repeated basis to reinstate

the issues are identical as to the Special Master and the Hearing

unanimous on that point.

2

Moreover, as I have noted, any argument — and this has

3

been made by Respondents in some repsects — that the Courts were

4

doing that which we wish them to do is belied by the fact that

the legislature explicity refused to fund these Masters.

Now I think it is our point that this kind of constant
daily ongoing intrusion into wholly state programs, whether it is

10

accomplished by a court, by itself, or with the assistance of

11

12

in the most extraordinary circumstances.

The reason is that our point on this state law issue is that

I am just curious, if the only duty the

10

Special Master was to monitor — It needed employees and it

11

needed to pay out a lot of things to vendors and things like

12

that?

13

MR. FERLEGER:

Yes.

The reason was when the Master

14

was appointed, Your Honor, the state had refused to come

15

forward with any plan to implement the relief that was ordered

16

by the Court.

17

to do certain things, the Federal Court was forced to do the

18

extra monitoring.

19

20

So that until 1982, when the state finally agreed

QUESTION:

So the Special Master at one point had much

wider duties than mere monitoring?

21

MR. FERLEGER:

Only monitoring, but the monitoring that

22

the Defendants should have done they didn't agree to do until

23

1982.

24

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS K. GILHOOL, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. GILHOOL:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:

Mr. Gilhool, you may proceed

SESSION

This Court's express instruction in its remand in
Pennhurst I, the Third Circuit, to consider the state law issue

10

required that the determination of two questions; first, the

11

substantiality of 14th Amendment issues in this case; and,

12

second, the power of the Federal Court to decide a state issue

13

which is pendent to a 14th Amendment claim.

14

Now, with respect to the substantiality of the 14th

15

Amendment question in this case, the Third Circuit in that was

16

unanimous as to its substantiality.

17

Certiorari on the substantiality of the 14th Amendment question

18

here.

Petitioners asked no

19

To say that the 14th Amendment question here is

20

substantial is to make a severe understatement given this

21

Court's decision last term in Romeo v. Youngberg.

22

In that case, the very 14th Amendment violations claimed in this

23

case were found by this Court to violate the 14th Amendment.

24

This is the same institution.

25

the class here.

Petitioners sought no Certiorari as to the 14th Amendment

and it is not contrived.

The 14th Amendment question here is not fake

Given that then the only question is the power of the

the source of the law relied upon, whether federal or state,

determines Federal Court jurisdiction.

comity questions, but I seek to prove that.

15
16

You wouldn't say that if the Court had the

power it had to excerise it, would you?

13
14

And, with respect to power

QUESTION:

— the option not to decide a state law

question.
MR. GILHOOL:

Well, of course, Your Honor, but the

22

first question is power and with respect to it the source of

23

the law argument has been considered and rejected in Gibbs,

24

exactly that argument was made there, that resort to state law

25

deprived the Court in Gibbs of Article III jurisdiction.
38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

Gibbs

1

held that Federal Courts have Article III jurisdiction to decide

2

the whole case including the state law issues by virtue of the

3

presence of a real federal question.

4
5

Now, Article III jurisdictional limits are no less
sacrosanct than the 11th Amendment.

6

Once the Court has jurisdiction, this Court — In

7

fact, Chief Justice Marshall has consistently said the Court

8

has it to decide the whole case including the state issue.

9

Now, Edelman itself, where state defendants were

10

defendants where the 11th Amendment was raised, dictates the

11

result

12

Court approved an injunction on pendent grounds requiring state

13

officials to timely decide public assistance claims.

14

with respect to jurisdiction here.

In Edelman, this

In Edelman, there was a 14th Amendment claim and

15

pendent jurisdiction.

16

as here, and counsel has conceded there is only prospective

17

relief in this case, the injunction rested upon the pendent

18

federal statute under Hagans.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. GILHOOL:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. GILHOOL:

The injunction in Edelman, prospective

Well, now, that is a pendent federal claim?
Exactly, Your Honor.

There was no pendent state claim?
No, Your Honor.

It was a pendent federal

23

statute, but the pendent injunction here is and can be on no

24

basis different from the pendent injunction in Edelman where

25

this Court has never held that a spending-power statute such as
39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

the Social Security Act, in that case itself overrides the 11th

2

Amendment.

3

In Edelman, jurisdiction to decide the case and to

4

grant an injunction, sourced in the pendent federal statute, had

5

to come — The power in the face of the 11th Amendment had to

6

come from the presence in the case of a real federal question.

7

The unanimous and several --

this Court

12

has not held that a spending power statute, for example, by

13

itself would overcome the 11th Amendment.

14

accommodation between the 14th Amendment and the 11th is, of

15

course, what is at stake here and the constitutional claim here

16

is a 14th Amendment claim.

17

A 14th — The Young

Now, we are, as I hope that made clear — Not saying

18

that the 11th Amendment is defeated by a state claim but rather

19

by the 14th Amendment federal question jurisdiction; just as

20

in Edelman, the 11th Amendment could not have been defeated by

21

the federal spending power statute, but only by the presence of

22

a 14th Amendment federal question.

23

And, of course, contrary to what Petitioners suggest

24

in their brief at page three, if you can't get retroactive

25

This Court — Its unanimous several opinions on this

6

count in Maher v. Gagne holds that same effect, as I have argued

7

the injunction in Edelman which you approved requires us to

8

seek.

9

Indeed, Petitioners' argument that the source of the

10

law relied upon is the key to the jurisdiction of the Federal

11

Court cannot be accepted unless you choose to cast Gibbs in

12

severe d^amnn unless Siler and the legion of cases cited by

13

the United States in its brief at pages 22 and 23 are overruled

14

and unless you choose to disapprove Edelman in this regard

15

as well as Townsend and Swenson and King and Smith and such

16

like.

17

The question then, Justice White, given the power

18

on an entirely independent ground from that argued by my

19

colleague, Mr. Ferleger, the ultra vires matter, given the

20

power, then the question is was the decision to excerise it

21

below, following the instructions of this Court in its remand,

22

an abuse of discretion by the Third Circuit?

23

The United States suggests in its brief, and we

24

agree and submit to the Court, that the Third Circuit in this

25

case responsibly followed the guidelines long established by

MR. GILHOOL:

13

QUESTION:

15
16

Yes.

Has the District Court passed on all three

12

14

First, the hoary

Yes, it did, long ago in 1977.

Did it first reach the state statutory

grounds?
MR. GILHOOL:

No, Your Honor, it decided the full

run of grounds.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. GILHOOL:

Which did it reach first?

I would think —

Your Honor, in its opinion the

19

constitutional issue was first and I believe the federal

20

statutory issue second and the state statutory —

21

QUESTION:

Well, isn't that a departure from what

22

you call the hoarytradition?

23

you don't reach the constitutional issue?

24
25

MR. GILHOOL:

If you decide a statutory issue,

Well, it certainly is not a departure

from the hoary tradition against splintered cases, but, yes,
42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Your Honor, it is a departure from the Ashwander rule which

2

Petitioners would ask this Court to place in serious question

3

in this case.

4

If the District Court, however, departed from the

5

Ashwander rule that state claims should first be decided, the

6

Third Circuit did not pursuant to this Court's instructions.

7

QUESTION:

Do you think it is necessarily part of the

8

Ashwander rule, not only to decide state issues first but to

9

decline to reach the constitutional issue?

10

MR. GILHOOL:

Yes, it is, exactly, Your Honor.

And,

11

if Petitioners had their way, as they said, I believe, in

12

question from you, Justice White, earlier, the Federal Court

13

could only consider the constitutional question.

14

that, Your Honor, is to cause Plaintiffs to omit state claims

15

and, hence, turning Ashwander upside down to face Federal

16

Courts entirely unnecessarily with the question of state law

17

issues.

18

The effect of

Now, the policy in Ashwander, as you suggest, Justice

19

White, really derives from two considerations.

20

against — A constitutional policy like the one against splintered

21

litigation, a policy against the unnecessary decision of

22

constitutional question for its own sake, for the integrity of

23

constitutional judgments, the avoidance of prematurity and so

24

on.

25

One is the policy

But, there is quite an independent policy of which
43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Ashwander and Siler, which, of course, is the father to Ashwander,

2

partake and that is federalism itself.

3
4
5

6

One of the reasons for avoiding constitutional decisions
in cases involving state defendants is precisely that they are
so intrusive and the constitutional decision binds the state
officials forever.

7

8
9

A decision on pendent state law grounds leaves state
officials free to try to change state law rather than exercising
that freedom.

QUESTION:

14
15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

Application of comity would satisfy all

those concerns, however, wouldn't it?

12
13

Petitioners —

MR. GILHOOL:

Well, Your Honor, I would suggest that

each of those concerns would require that the application of
comity result in the decision by the Federal Court of the state
law.

Remember, that unlike fair assessment, there is no tax

injunction case relative here.

Unlike Younger, there is no

anti-injunction statute here.
Indeed, in this case, as Gibbs put it, there is
especially strong reason for the Federal Court to exercise its power to decide the state law issue.

The Gibbs' reason,

applicable here, is that the state law issue here is so closely
tied to questions of federal policy.
QUESTION:

However, against that is the required

expenditure of large sums from the state treasury.
MR. GILHOOL:

Ah, Your Honor, I think that question
44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

is not here.

2

that the relief granted below is less costly than maintaining

3

the wrongs at Pennhurst.

4

Indeed, I think Petitioners have conceded here

The finding of fact by District Court, unanimously

5

upheld by the Court of Appeals, was to that effect; that the

6

provision of community relief, where it is justified for the

7

individual is less costly than the maintenance of Pennhurst.

8

Again, Petitioners did not seek Certiorari here on that finding

9

of fact.

10
11
12

So, I suggest, Your Honor, that each of those con­
siderations requires that comity be exercised.
If I may, in addition to Pennhurst I, where this Court

13

found a congressionally expressed national policy to improve

14

the care and treatment of the retarded by the use of community

15

facilities —

16

There is, of course, the statute noted in Patsy,

17

the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, expressive

18

of the same policy and in Schweiker v. Wilson, Justice Powell

19

writing in dissent with others noted the same federal policy

20

and traced there to the Social Security Act of 1965 and, indeed,

21

as expressed there, Justice Powell, that policy rests in the

22

Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Act of the

23

Congress of 1962, precisely the Act, precisely the federal Act,

24

passed in response to the community initiatives, which invited

25

the state to look at what it was doing with retarded people
45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

and resulted, as the exhibits in the record of this case demon­

2

strate, in this very Pennsylvania statute, the Act of 1966.

3

That is Park

4

Exhibit 18.

If I may return just a moment to the ultra vires

5

argument made by my colleague, Mr. Ferleger, let me suggest

6

that you cannot read the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme

7

Court in Schmidt or the several opinions unanimous as to the

8

meaning of state law and its violation by state defendants

9

by all of the members of the Third Circuit en banc without

10

concluding that these state defendants placed themselves

11

systematically outside of Pennsylvania law by their conduct

12

with respect to the people at Pennhurst.

13

Just before I close, let me be clear that the

14

county Petitioners and their officials here do not share whatever

15

11th Amendment immunity may be here and so that in all events

16

the orders below as to them must be affirmed.

17

And, finally, Mr. Justice White, let me confess that

18

following the opinions of this Court in Pennhurst I and the

19

opinions of the Court of Appeals, Plaintiffs — Respondents

20

here find no support for the original order appointing the

21

Special Master and in particular for that part which instructed

22

that Master to direct, organize, and supervise the implementation

23

of relief.

24
25

Indeed, the District Court itself, on the first return
of the mandate to it after this Court's expression, vacated those

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

instructions.

2

planning of relief, a function, a duty for which the appointment

3

of a Master, I take it, is unexceptional when as here the state

4

defendants twice refused to come forward to the court with a

5

plan for implementation.

6
7

It also vacated the instructions to assist in the

In Swann, for example, such a Master was appointed
and this Court, of course, affirmed generally there.

Mr. Chief JusticeI

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

10

Counsel?

11
12

Do you have anything further,

MR. FARR:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, just a few points,

please.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

14

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III, ESQ.

15
16

Very well, Mr. Farr.

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS
MR. FARR:

Counsel seems to argue that the 11th — the

17

14th Amendment simply knocks over the 11th Amendment and then

18

the pendent claims can follow in behind it without having been

19

tested against the 11th Amendment and he cites Edelman for that

20

proposition.

21

Edelman, as we discussed this morning, simply doesn't

22

stand for that proposition.

23

in Edelman that we say should be made here, whether the

24

particular claim at issue was barred by the 11th Amendment.

25

the prospective relief in Edelman, the Court found that that

The Court made exactly the inquiry

47
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

For

1

claim was not barred by the 11th Amendment under the principles

2

of Ex Parte Young which applied to that claim.

3

For the claim

that dealt with retroactive relief, it

4

found that it was barred by the 11th Amendment because Ex Parte

5

Young does not cover that type of claim.

6

Our argument, as I said this morning, is that Ex Parte

7

Young does not cover the kind of claim that we have in this case

8

and, therefore, Edelman fully supports our position.

9

Secondly, counsel has said that state law — I believe

10

Mr. Ferleger said — has been clear for 16 years and that this

11

is a lawless effort by the state officials to ignore it.

12

First of all, we don't think it was clear when the

13

complaint was filed.

14

District Court said state law required the closing of Pennhurst.

15

We don't think it was clear when the Third Circuit on the first

16

appeal said that state law did not require the creation of CLA's,

17

but only that to the .extent that there are facilities being

18

maintained that they provide adequate care and habilitation

19

and frankly we don't think it is clear now because the decisions

20

from the Pennsylvania Court do not deal with the issue of how

21

to provide CLA's where the legislature has not provided funding.

We don't think it was clear when the

22

Those issues are not present in the state cases where

23

a single individual is concerned and the issue of whether there

24

is funding for one person is not an issue.

25

Furthermore, the District Court, in rejecting a claim
48
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

I

1

for damages, said there was no reason to think that the State

2

Defendants were not carrying out the duties to their best of abiliit}

3

and had no reason to know that they were violating any law or

4

any rights of the Plaintiffs at that time and that is at page

5

75-A of the original — of the Appendix of the original Petition

6

for Certiorari —

7

QUESTION:

May I ask you just one question?

Precisely

8

at what stage of the proceedings did your clients raise the 11th

9

Amendment objection to the pendent state law claim?

10

MR. FARR:

My understanding is that the 11th Amendment

11

issue was raised certainly on appeal the first time to the Third

12

Circuit if not before.

13

QUESTION:

Had it been raised before we looked at the

14

case two years ago and said — told the Third Circuit to look

15

at the state law issues?

16

MR. FARR:

It was raised at that time although it

17

was not specifically directed toward the state law issues,

18

because the District Court, of course, had raised —

19

20
21

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

When was the argument you are making today

first raised?
MR. FARR:

It was raised in its specifics on the

remand to the Third Circuit.
QUESTION:

And, how did you — Just in your brief

at that time?
MR. FARR:

We raised it in our briefs and, of course,

49
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

we argued it before the Third Circuit and the Third Circuit did

2

address it.

3

QUESTION:

I understand that.

4

MR. FARR:

And they rejected it.

5

QUESTION:

But, you never filed a motion to strike the

6

state law claims entirely in the District Court, for example?

7

You never tried to separate those out.

8
9

MR. FARR:

Well, the case — As I understood it, those

cases, those claims, were before the Third Circuit on appeal

10

at that point so we filed our brief with the Court of Appeals

11

saying that they should not consider it.

12

I have nothing further.
