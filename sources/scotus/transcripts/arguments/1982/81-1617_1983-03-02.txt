ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
HR. HOROWITZ:

9

We will hear arguments

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court, the issue presented here

10

concerns the constitutionality of police conduct

11

undertaken to investigate suspicion of illegal activity

12

as it arises in a public place.
Specifically, when circumstances arise that

13
14

give police a reasonable suspicion that an individual is

15

carrying contraband in his suitcase, is it reasonable

16

within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment for the

17

police to detain that suitcase for a limited time in

18

order to conduct a specific limited course of

19

investigation to confirm or dispel their suspicion, in

20

this case, to arrange for a sniff by a

21

narcotics-detecting dog?
The Court of Appeals held, and Respondent

22
23

25

argues -QUESTION:

Mr. Horowitz, are you contesting

basically the issue relating to the seizure and

detention of the luggage as opposed to the subsequent

2

exposure to the dog sniff?

HR. HOROWITZ;

Yes, there is no contention

here that the dog sniff itself was unconstitutional,

seizure and detention.
MR. HOROWITZ;

11

So all we are dealing with is the

Yes, the 90-minute period of

time during which the Respondent was dispossessed of his
luggage.
The Court of Appeals held, and Respondent

12

argues, that such conduct is unreasonable unless the

13

police have probable cause to believe that the suitcase

14

contains contraband, the same standard that would

15

justify arresting the individual.

16

The facts underlying this case can be

17

summarized as follows.

18

on duty at Miami Airport observed respondent behaving in

19

a manner characterized by the District Court as "odd, if

20

not bizarre."

21

behavior seemed designed to detect surveillance, and

22

created a suspicion in their minds that Respondent was a

23

drug courier.

24
25

Two Florida narcotics detectives

To the trained eyes of the agents, this

The officers also noted that Respondent had
purchased his ticket with cash, and that there were

certain discrepancies in the information on his baggage

2

tags.

3

They approached Respondent in the boarding

4

area, and had a brief conversation with him, but they

5

terminated that conversation to allow Respondent to

6

catch his flight to New York.

7

however, called ahead and communicated all of the

8

information they have obtained to DEA Agent Gerard

9

Whitmore, who was stationed at LaGuardia Airport.

10

The Florida detectives,

Agent Whitmore and his partner watched

11

Respondent as he alighted from the flight in New York.

12

They also observed him engaged in a series of maneuvers

13

that appeared to them to be designed to detect and evade

14

surveillance, and that indicated to these officers as

15

well that Respondent likely was a drug courier.

16

After Respondent retrieved his bags from the

17

baggage claim, the agents approached him, identified

18

themselves, and informed him that he was suspected of

19

carrying narcotics.

20

he had recognized the agents as policemen, a remark he

21

had also made to the officers in Florida.

Respondent immediately stated that

22

When asked whether the bags he was carrying

23

were his. Respondent said that they were, and then he

24

falsely stated that he had already been surrounded by a

25

gang of agents in Miami who searched both his person and

5

1

his bags

2

Respondent subsequently refused a request by

3

the officers to consent to a search of his bags, and

4

then asked them whether he was under arrest.

5

Whitmore informed him that he was free to leave, but

6

that his luggage would be kept and taken to a judge to

7

determine whether there was probable cause for the

8

issuance of a search warrant.

Agent

9

The agents explained to Respondent that they

10

would not open the luggage without a warrant, and that

11

they would return it to him if no warrant was issued.

12

Some further conversation ensued, in which Respondent

13

retracted his earlier admission of ownership of one of

14

the bags, and asked the officers whether some

15

arrangement could be made or whether something could be

16

fixed up so that he could still leave the airport with

17

his bags.

18

pressing engagements and did not wish to remain with his

19

luggage, and the agents gave him a number for him to

20

contact them to arrange for the return of his luggage.

21

Ultimately, Respondent stated that he had

The agents then took the luggage to the

22

Customs mail handling facility at Kennedy Airport to

23

arrange for exposure to a drug-detecting dog.

24

Approximately 90 minutes after the luggage was taken

25

from Respondent, the dog reacted positively to one

3

cocaine, m arijuana, and LSD were found.

4

After a search warrant was obtained, the

The District Court denied a motion to

5

suppress, finding that Agent Whitmore had reasonable

6

suspicion that Respondent’s suitcase contained

7

con traband , and that this suspicion justified the

8

tern porary detention of the luggage to arrange for the

9

dog sniff.
A divided Court of Appeals reversed.

10

The

11

majority a ccepted the District Court's finding of

12

reasonable suspicion, but held that the detention of a

13

suitcase b ased on such suspicion could last no longer

14

than could a temporary detention of a perso n, and hence

15

the 90-min ute detention here was uncon stitu tional in the

16

absence of probable cause.

QUESTIONS

16

MR. HOROWITZs

Right.

That is in the record.
That is in the record.

Also,

17

there is nothing in the record that suggests that

18

Respondent ever called them to find out about getting

19

his bag back, so there was nothing they could have done

20

with it anyway.

21

QUESTIONS

Mr. Horowitz, are you in a position

22

to say, what if the sniffing dogs at Kennedy at come up

in addition to the 90 minutes would have been required

25

to get the baggage back to the Respondent?

MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, we can't know in this

2

case, because Respondent never -- in the course of his

3

conversation with them at the airport, he didn't seem

4

very concerned about getting his bag back.

5

gave them his address where he was going to be or told

6

them anything about how to return it to them.

7

thing that was left was that Respondent was going to

8

call them to arrange to get it back.

The only

So, as I said to Justice Marshall, I’m not

sure how they could have returned it in this case.
QUESTION;

11

Well, but is there some ordinary

12

practice after you take a person's bags to get it back

13

to them?
MR. HOROWITZ;

14

The practice is to give it back

15

to them as expeditiously as possible.

If they knew

16

where Respondent was, they would just have it delivered

17

to where he was.

If he lived ten minutes from LaGuardia

19

QUESTION;

Well, did they know where he was?

20

MR. HOROWITZ;

No, they didn't know where he

21

was.

22

there was cocaine in the suitcase, his idea was to get

23

as far away as possible.

24
25

He didn’t tell them.

QUESTION;

Are you sure about that?

they make arrangements to deliver the luggage the way an

MR. HOROWITZ:

There is not a published policy

The DEA informs me that as a general rule,

they do deliver the luggage directly to the people, and

it might wall be unreasonable for them not to.

Well, first of all, if the

person is concerned about getting his baggage back

Your distinction then about the

would obviously occur to him to ask the agents how he is

QUESTION;

Is there any way of saying from the

record how long the detention of a bag that turned up

negative on the sniffing would have taken if the

10

government had had dogs at LaGuardia?

MR. HOROWITZ:

That's true.

Well, I mean, I

have to agree that there are going to be cases -- I

why, then the likelihood of an unsuccessful search is

If you have a probable cause standard,

MR. HOROWITZ:

Exactly, but the intrusion that

11

is involved in those cases is much greater, and

therefore here the probability should be lowered.

In some districts -Now, what they would have done

if Place had called and sought to get his luggage back

5

at that point, I*m not sure, but at least in this case,

6

since there wasn’t anything else they could do with the

7

luggage anyway, it didn’t seem unreasonable to wait

8

until Monday.
QUESTION;

9

Is it not true that in some

10

districts there is 24-magistrate service, seven days a

11

week, if you know?
MR. HOROWITZ;

12

I don't know for sure.

I know

13

that magistrates are supposed to be on duty other than

14

15

there is a reluctance, that there is some scale as to

16

when they should be bothered at those times.
QUESTION;

17

There is nothing in the record to

show why, though.

The only thing in the record is that

not dealing any more with the detention on the basis of

1

the person was the protection of the officers from the

2

use of weapons by the person detained.

3

justification, of course, is not present with the

4

seizure and detention of luggage.

5

MR. HOROWITZ:

That

I don’t think that’s really the

6

justification for the investigative stop in cases like

7

Terry, Brignoni-Ponce, and Michigan against Summers.

8

That was the justification for the frisk in Terry, for

9

the search,

but of course the officer in Terry was not

10

in any danger until he actually approached the subject.

11

He could have turned around and walked around the

12

block.

13

these cases, and is, I think, well set forth by the

14

Court in Adams against Williams, is that an officer,

when he has a strong suspicion that a crime was about to

16

be committed, is not supposed to just turn his back and

17

walk away and sit idly by while it happens.

What was the justification for the approach in

18

Michigan against Summers and Dunaway against

19

New York, however, state that there are time limits on

20

the detention of a person that can be based on

21

reasonable suspicion.

22

temporary detention becomes close to the intrusiveness

23

of an arrest, it must be justified by probable cause.

24

Now, the real issue in this case is whether

25

At some point, when that

the Court of Appeals is correct in saying that the exact

1

same standard that applies to when a temporary detention

2

of a person becomes overextended, does that also apply

3

to the temporary detention of effects, even though the

4

intrusion onto a person's liberty is obviously much

5

less?

6

We submit that there cannot be this equality,

7

and that it must be that a detention of effects can be

8

extended for a longer period of time, for example, the

9

90 minutes involved in this case.

10

The Court has on many occasions stated the

11

basis on which the reasonableness of a police action is

12

to be determined.

13

intrusion on the individual’s Fourth Amendment interests

14

against its promotion of legitimate government concerns.

15

It is judged by balancing the

Mow, in making that balancing here, I think

16

the strong government concerns involved are clear.

The

17

government has a vital interest in alleviating the

18

narcotics problem in this country, and in detecting and

19

apprehending drug offenders.

20

suspect an individual of transporting narcotics through

21

an airport, they obviously have a strong interest in

22

preventing him from escaping and placing those drugs

23

irretrievably into the chain of distribution.

When officers reasonably

24

That interest is much stronger in a case like

25

this one, where they know that if they can preserve the

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

status quo for a short time, they can either confirm

2

that suspicion or it will be dispelled.

3

rule established by the Court of Appeals, the officers

4

in this case were placed in the position of allowing a

5

person they strongly suspected of carrying drugs to

6

escape from right under their noses, while they are left

7

with the knowledge that if they had just had a little

8

bit more time to investigate, they could have developed

9

probable cause, arrested him, and seized the drugs.

Thus, under the

Now, weighed against this strong government

10
11

interest is what we feel is a fairly limited intrusion

12

caused by the temporary detention involved here, and

13

that is simply the dispossession of Respondent’s luggage

14

for the time required to complete the dog sniff.
At the outset, let me say that it has never

15
16

been contended that this is no intrusion at all.

17

an interference with the Respondent's possessory

18

interest in his suitcase for a limited period of time,

19

and it is a seizure that is covered by the Fourth

20

Amendment.

21

It is

What is contended here is that this intrusion

22

is sufficiently small that it is justified by reasonable

23

suspicion of criminal activity, and does not require the

24

strictest standard of probable cause.

25

Now, to illuminate this point, it is useful to

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

examine the detention here in light of the intrusive

2

aspects associated with other police actions that

3

normally require probable cause.

4

of these, of course, is investigative searches, which

5

usually can be conducted only on probable cause.

6

of course, involve an invasion of privacy, which the

7

Court has many times recognized as the core of the

8

Fourth Amendment protection.

9

The biggest category

In this case, there was no search until a

10

warrant based on probable cause was obtained.

11

no invasion of privacy whatsoever.

12

Those,

There was

The principle that the core protection of the

13

Fourth Amendment is privacy finds its expression in many

14

areas of Fourth Amendment law.

15

warrant area, the Court has recognized that the

16

protections of a warrant are much more necessary in the

17

area of searches than they are in seizures.

18

seizures from public places are generally recognized as

19

reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, as are

20

warrantless arrests.

21

For example, in the

Warrantless

Similarly, in Chadwick, a case where this

22

Court held that the police were not allowed to search a

23

footlocker in that case on the basis of probable cause

24

until they had obtained a warrant, the Court also stated

25

that it was clear that they were entitled to detain that

footlocker without a warrant while they were seeking the

2

issuance of the warrant.
And also, in the immigration area, the Court

3
4

has recognized that roving border patrols are empowered

5

to effect seizures of cars suspected of carrying aliens

6

on the basis of reasonable suspicion, but they are not

7

empowered to search those cars without probable cause.
QUESTIONS

8
9

Mr. Horowitz, would you think that

you would apply the same theory you are arguing should

10

be applied here to the seizure and detention of a

11

handbag or briefcase from a person?
MR. HOROWITZ;

12

I would say yes.

The short

13

answer is yes.

I think the police are still entitled,

14

that there is still a much lesser intrusion involved in

15

the seizure of something like that.
QUESTION;

16

Do you think that it might be a

17

sufficient intrusion .that it obviously involves

18

detaining the person?

19

money and all the means of getting away from the airport

20

are contained in your purse or briefcase, is that not in

21

effect a detention of the person?

22

MR. HOROWITZ;

For instance, if your keys and

I don’t think so. Justice

23

O'Connor, because as we said in our brief, we think it

24

would be unreasonable for the police to keep all of that

25

material.

I mean, there is no reason why they can’t

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

allow persons to take keys and their wallet or something

2

like that out of a pocketbook.

3
4

In this case, of course, you don’t really have
anything like that, because the luggage was checked.
QUESTION;

5

But your opponent contests the

6

government’s assertion there, and says that the

7

government, if it is sequestering an effect for purposes

8

of later search, isn't going to allow unilateral access

9

to a bag to get something out of it.
MR. HOROWITZ;

10

Well, they may not allow

11

private access in the.sense of a person going behind a

12

locked door and taking whatever he wants out and

13

disappearing, but certainly a person could open the

14

suitcase, say, somewhere within the view of the

15

officers, but in a way that doesn’t expose the other

16

contents of the suitcase.
QUESTION;

17

Well, perhaps it is too short a

18

time for argument to explain how that might be done.

19

Your saying so doesn't convince me that it could be

20

done.

21

MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, let me just say, if you

22

had a briefcase sitting on the desk, and you opened it

23

with the top towards me so that I couldn’t see what was

24

in there, and took a couple things out and then closed

25

it again, I think the officers would be entitled to see

23

what you had taken out of the briefcase, but I don’t see

why they would see what is in there.

perhaps dispose of its contents, or something like

that.
MR. HOROWITZ*

16

I agree, but I don’t consider

17

that a search of the suitcase.

If the person says he

18

needs his car keys out of there, and he is asked to show

19

his keys, I just don't think that many persons would

20

consider that much of an intrusion on their personal

21

rights to have to show their car keys to agents.

22

think most people would recognize that that is a

23

perfectly reasonable thing for the agents to do in these

24

circumstances, once they were going to detain the

temporary detention can require probable cause if it

some reason to suspect that there were -- in the

suspicion if he was going to ask for a search of the

I think he would be entitled to look at the

some indication of whether there was something else

MR. HOROWITZ:

5

questions, I think, are directed at some exceptional

QUESTION:

intervention from DEA agents, to find that their luggage

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. CLARK, ESQ.,

7
8
9

Mr. Clark.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. CLARK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, I had not planned to address myself to

10

specific factual issues or discussions.

However, in

11

light of some of the questions from the Court, I would

12

like to speak to the resolution of some of the facts

13

that have been raised by the members of the Court.

14

For example, I think it was pointed out that

15

at Miami, when Mr. Place was initially detained by the

16

public safety officers there, he was detained and

17

certain information was acquired under the so-called

18

Drug Courier Profile.

19

that in light of the investigation conducted by these

20

officers, their suspicions were quelled.

21

What was omitted was the fact

For example, in the case of Ballard from the

22

Fifth Circuit, where the Drug Courier Profile was

23

conveniently itemized, one of the things that these

24

officers look for is whether or not the ticket is issued

25

in the same name as the identification that is produced

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

by the detainee.

2

coincided without exception.

3

In this particular instance, the name

Also, in the Ballard case it is pointed out

4

that one of the facts that they look for is whether or

5

not the luggage is hand-carried luggage, and whether or

6

not he is only carrying one bag.

7

QUESTION’!

Well,

Mr. Clark, you say the

8

suspicions in the case of your client were quelled at

9

Miami.

10

Then why did the Miami agents call ahead to

LaGuardia?
MR. CLARKs

11

The reason the y called ahe ad to

12

LaGuardia was, in the words of Judge Platt , the

13

presiding District Court judge, in h is opinion, was why

14

Mr. Place made a mistake.

15

16

them and said, I knew that you were police, that you

were law enforcement authorities all the time.

20

ran down and retrieved information f rom the name tags on

the two suitcases.
QUESTION;

22

It isn’t really accurate, then, to

23

say their suspicions were quelled, because they did call

24

ahead .

25

MR. CLARK:

That’s correct.

But for that

QUESTIONj

Well, I thought they discovered

that he had a false address on his luggage tags.
ME. CLARK:

That is not correct, Your Honor.

8

I believe a specific reading of the record will

9

determine that the information that was relayed by

10

Detective KcGavock to Agent Whitmore in New York made no

11

mention of this supposed disparity.

12

fact, it is pointed out in the record --

13

QUESTION:

That fact was not relayed to Gerry Whitmore

QUESTION:

But in any event, it didn't satisfy

22

the police in Miami.

23

MR. CLARK:

That's correct.

We do not dispute

24

that they called ahead and alerted DEA to Mr. Place's

25

imminent arrival on the airline flight.

1

The other thing that I woul3 like to point out

2

is that although the officers had the two suitcases

3

subjected to a dog sniff approximately 90 minutes after

4

the bags were seized, they achieved a result of positive

5

on one bag and nothing on the other bag, and they took

6

no steps during the weekend to contact Mr. Place so he

7

could get back the bag that was not the subject of the

8

search warrant.

9
10
11

QUESTIONS

But I thought he hadn't given them

an address or a means whereby they could contact him.
MR. CLARK;

They had his address.

They had

also had his telephone number.

credentials as being verified by his driver's license,

and his ticket coincided.

incumbent, at least at this point, on Mr. Place to seek

out his bags.

18

least 50 percent or more of these cases are not going to

19

turn out to be subjects of investigation, and yet there

20

are no steps, at least known to the government at this

21

point, as to how the DEA plans to get these bags back

22

into people's hands.

intrusive because his bag did not go its way, and it is

MR. CLARK;

It said that there had been a

The way I understand Van Leeuwen,

21

they said that at some point in time, even a seizure

22

such as the one in this case will become unreasonable,

23

but the reason that such a seizure in the Van Leeuwen

24

case was not considered unreasonable was because the

25

defendant bad voluntarily relinquished the bags, and for

38

the period of time that they were detained# the
defendant in that case was probably not even aware that
a seizure was occurring, because until the addressee in
Van Leeuwen became aware that the parcels had not
arrived, and contacted Hr. Van Leeuwen, he probably was
going about his merry way, and his mobility was not
restrained, as it certainly was in this instance.
Also, in Van Leeuwen, the probable cause, the
factual determination of the facts that eventually led
to probable cause for the search of the two parcels, was
obtained through independent sources.
QUESTION;

Kell, but that may factually

distinguish Van Leeuwen, but the case does hold that a
parcel as opposed to a person may be subjected to some
sort of reasonable detention on a Terry type analysis,

utilized in

case to the facts as presented by that case.

here today to determine whether or not this Court is
going to take the position that indeed bags, items of

cognizant of the preservation of Fourth Amendment rights

I think that is a selective governmental

I would also like to point out to the Court
that the government apparently takes the position that

privacy denotes only an opportunity to be free from

12

because the bags were not searched, that is, opened,

13

until a warrant had been issued, the intrusion into Mr.

15

narrow view of what privacy is.

In other words,

MR. HOROWITZ;

A view brief points. Nr. Chief

J ustice.
I think the Court has to consider the
implications of Respondent’s argument that this
detention here can be effected only on the basis of
probable cause, keeping in mind Justice Stevens' commen t
that we are dealing with probabilities here.

On the

basis of pcobable cause, even sometimes probable cause
only in the judgment of an officer, and not approved by
a magistrate, police are entitled to search a person's
effects.

They are entitled to search his home.

are entitled to arrest him.

They

They are entitled to

imprison him, even though in some of those cases,
because of the very nature of the probable cause
standard, we know that the suspicion is going to turn
out to be wrong.
Here, the intrusion is so much less that it
must be reasonable to allow the intrusion on the lesser
standard of reasonable suspicion, even though in some
cases this may permit a baggage detention where the
person turns out not to have contraband in his
suitcase .
I think to graphically illustrate the sort of
reasonable suspicion standard that we are talking about,
you might consider a case where the police have

reasonable suspicion to believe that some of, say, a

2

group of tan people have contraband in their suitcases,

3

and they know that three or four of them have heroin in

4

their suitcase, but the other six or seven do net.

5

it really reasonable for the police to allow all ten of

6

them to walk out of the airport, knowing that they are

7

allowing 40 pounds of heroin to go, or should they be

8

able to detain all ten suitcases for the hour and a half

I would also say that it may be that in some

13

case just because of the detention, the cases that

14

Justice O’Connor and Justice Stevens were talking about,

15

16

out of his suitcase that he needs immediately.

17

I should say first that this is the typical
