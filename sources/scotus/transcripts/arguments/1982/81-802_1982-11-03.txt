Mr. Mizell, you may proceed whenever

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. MIZELL*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court*
This case involves the proper application of

11

the Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

It arises out

12

of the circumstances which have developed in the City of

13

Lockhart, Texas.

14

people located in central Texas.

15

prior to 1973, it was governed as a general law city in

16

Texas by a commission form of government.

It had a

Plurality.

In 1972, the city

22

began to explore the adoption of a home rule charter,

23

and a charter commission was formed to begin inquiry as

24

to whether or not a charter would be desirable for the

25

City of Lockhart.

They determined that it was and

began, as charter commissioners elected subsequently, to

2

draft a home rule charter for the city.

3

The charter commission was made up of 15

4

people, nine of whom were Anglos, six of whom were

5

minority citizens; of those six, four were Mexican

6

Americans and two were Negro.

The commission worked for several months in

thereafter until 1978.

In 1975, the Voting Rights Act was made

This

But for

Elections continued until 1978; were scheduled

10

for 1979 when the Mexican American plaintiffs in this

11

case filed an action for injunctive relief seeking to

12

block elections in Lockhart under the charter until the

13

charter received pre-clearance.

14

It’s interesting to know that the injunction

15

issued by the judge in Austin, Texas, the local district

16

judge, was written in such a way that it did not allow

17

elections using numbered places, whether they were under

18

the old system or under the new system.

19

have been no elections in Lockhart until this day

20

because the city was foreclosed — at least it felt that

21

it was — by the wording of the order from going back to

22

the prior system.

23

to initially.

And so there

Although it would have been willing

24

The city's position in Austin in the district

25

court there and has been all along was that the changes

1

adopted in 1973 by the charter were probably

2

advantageous for minority voting rights in Lockhart, or

3

at least neutral, but certainly not negative in their

4

impact.

5

In 1982, this year, as set forth in the

6

supplemental brief we filed a week or so ago, Judge

7

Hepalito Garci, the judge in San Antonio who now has

8

charge of the 1979 proceedings, in response to a motion

9

for interim elections which was filed by the intervenor

10

in this case, reviewed the order that had been entered

11

in 1979 and revised that order.

12

he revised had to do with the procedure by which

13

elections could be conducted pending pre-clearance.

14

And the language that

The language of his order clarifies and allows

1§

the city to return to the prior system of electing a

16

mayor and two commissioners every other year until such

17

time as pre-clearance is either granted, or if it's

18

denied I presume that we would stay with the old system.

19

The impact of that order is that it

20

substantially undercuts both the position of the

21

intervenor in this case with regard to what the standard

22

for measurement should be under the Voting Rights Act,

23

and it also undermines the position of the lower court

24

below which framed its opinion in terms of an assumption

25

or conclusion that the judge in Austin, Texas had

6
ALDERSCN REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62B-9300

1

concluded that the prior system, using numbered places

2

for election of the two places-that were existing at

3

that time, that those numbered places were invalid under

4

Texas law.

5

So we have the district court in Washington

6

relying in part upon what it believed to be the finding

7

by the district judge in Austin, Texas.

8

now been reversed upon reconsideration by the judge, and

9

we are now free for the first time since this litigation

10

began, free to return to the system which was in effect,

11

in practice, prior to the adoption of the charter.

12

That ruling has

This means that for purposes of comparison,

13

it's the City of Lockhart’s position that the

14

appropriate standard was, and at all times has been, the

15

actual system that was in operation in Lockhart and had

16

been since 1917 or thereabouts, using the numbered

17

places.
Now with that in mind, the question becomes

18
19

what kind of standard of comparison did the court below

20

used.

21

a matter of law in making the comparison to the wrong

22

standard.

23

in a general law city, in Lockhart, Texas, were in

24

contravention of state law, and therefore, were deemed

25

by the district court below to be invalid.

It’s our contention that the court below erred as

The allegation was made that numbered places

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

They made the comparison and the expert

2

testimony educed on behalf of the intervenor and on

3

behalf of the Justice Department below were based upon

4

the assumption that the system that had been in

5

operation was illegal under Texas law.

6

The city first takes the position that that’s

7

not supportable under Texas law, and we argued that

8

vigorously in the district court below, but we haven't

9

briefed that for this Court because we really don’t

10

think it makes any difference.

11

The law that this Court has followed at least

12

since Perkins versus Matthews of 1971 is that you don’t

13

look at some theoretical system that should be used or

14

might be used or could be used; you focus on the system

15

that was actually in effect, and measure the changes

16

against that system.

17

The system actually in effect is undisputed in

18

this case; and that is, numbered places for election of

19

the two city commissioners prior to adoption of the

20

charter.

21

Therefore, in trying to identify the precise

22

nature of the changes which were rightly reviewable by

23

the court below, the city urges that there were really

24

only two changes.

25

of the city’s governing body from three to five; that’s

The first change was the enlargment

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

mayor plus two commissioners to now mayor plus four city

2

councilmen.

3

We take the position and strongly urge it,

4

that putting numbered places for the two new councilmen

5

whose positions were just created there, was not a

6

change because Lockhart had been using numbered places

7

for over half a century.

8

just made the council bigger and continued that system

9

in operation.

10

So what we really did was we

The court below was divided, and Chief Judge

11

Spottswood Robinson took a slightly different tact in

12

his dissent with regard to those numbered places for the

13

two new seats.

14

two new seats were unobjectionable, that putting

15

numbered places on those did constitute a change.

16

then he went on to make the comparison in the before and

17

after test and determined that it didn’t make any

18

difference that there was no negative impact whether you

19

considered the imposition of numbered places to the two

20

new seats.

21

negative impact change.

22

He took the position that although the

And

He decided that that did not constitute a

And under Beer versus United States which this

23

Court decided in 1976, without retrogressive effect the

24

addition of the numbered places to the two new seats, he

25

concluded, did not have a negative impact.

The city's position, as I say, is slightly

2

different.

3

governing body, or the city's governing body, by two

4

places meant that the numbered place system was carried

5

forward, and the only thing to be really measured was

6

whether or not enlarging the size of the city’s

7

governing body had positive, negative or neutral impact.

QUESTION*

Well, you seem to suggest then that

this was a change, subject to Section 5.

10
11

We simply think that enlarging the council's

MR. MIZELL*

The enlargment of the council,

yes, sir.

12

QUESTION*

13

MR. MIZELLs

You agree with that?
We believe that the enlargment

14

was a Section 5 change, and needed to be considered,

15

reviewed by the Justice Department and pre-cleared.

16

QUESTION*

17

MR. MIZELLs

And was that always your position?
Yes, sir. Justice White, it

18

always has been.

19

the district court in Austin which —

20

22

QUESTION*

Said it wasn't even subject to

preclearance.
MR. MIZELL*

23

preclearance.

24

response to a —

25

We initially filed some pleadings in

Said it was not subject to

Those were rather hastily drafted in

QUESTION;

So you concede that it was a change

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

that must satisfy the Beer standard.

2

MR. MIZELL;

We certainly do.

And the second

3

change, which was brough about by the charter, was the

4

staggered term aspect of it.

5

Robinson below in his dissent recognized that you have

6

to — if you just take a four or five-member governing

7

body that's being elected all at once every other year

8

and carve it up into three one year and two the next,

9

that's one situation.

10

And again, Chief Judge

But our position is — and Chief Judge

11

Robinson below noted this -- it depends on how they get

12

there as to whether or not there's any discriminatory

13

impact.

14

decide to elect them in an odd-numbered year or off-year

15

election, then there's no way that you can determine any

16

discriminatory impact because now you have a totally new

17

election for two new seats that never existed before.

18

If you're creating two new ones and happen to

If you move from five elected all at once to

19

two one year and three the next, that could certainly

20

have discriminatory impact, and we don’t have any

21

argument with that proposition of law.

22

is that under the circumstances by which these two new

23

seats were created, there was no negative impact.

24

Chief Judge Robinson in the court below agreed with that.

25

What we do argue

And

So we think that first, the court below used

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

an erroneous standard with respect to the numbered

2

places.

3

fictitious scheme that never had existed before, never

4

will exist so far as Judge Hepalito Garcia's order is

5

concerned because if this Court were to rule against us

6

and we return to the prior system, we do it as a home

7

rule city and now, under the old election system.

That is, that they compared it against some

8

Which brings me to another point.

The third

9

question that was raised in our brief before this Court

10

dealt with the actual status of the City of Lockhart as

11

a home rule city.

12

by the majority below which casts some doubt as to

13

whether or not they intended to reduce Lockhart to its

14

general law status.

15

law, prior to adoption of the charter.

16

There is some language in the opinion

The status that it had under Texas

It's not entirely clear, and I certainly want

17

to be open with the Court on that point, that the

18

decision below is a little bit vague as to what they

19

intended on that, but we wanted to be cautious, so we

20

brought the matter to this Court as the third point in

21

our brief.

22

In response to that point, the Justice

23

Department has taken the position in its brief that we

24

have over-reacted and that the language there that casts

25

doubt upon the home rule status is simply not worthy of

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that conclusion.

2

reading the intevenor's brief that they also take the

3

position.

And it is my understanding from

4

So what you have now, as I understand it, is

5

the Justice Department is not taking the position that

6

we were reduced to general law status; the intervenor is

7

not taking that position and certainly, the city would

8

not want to take that position.

9

could safely conclude then that all the parties before

So I think the Court

10

the Court are now taking a position that we are and will

11

continue to be a home rule city, operating as a home

12

rule city with all the powers that are granted to a home

13

rule city under Texas law.

14

The findings of the court below, as I

15

mentioned a moment ago, we think are based upon an

16

incorrect standard for comparison.

17

the extent that they rest upon factfindings, may be seen

18

to be clearly erroneous under Rule 52 and the standard

19

which governs this Court.

20

necessarily have to be that way because if they are

21

using the wrong legal standard, then the facts that they

22

find may have very little applicability to what this

23

Court might want to decide.

24
25

The facts below, to

Although it doesn't

But to the extent that there was testimony
below which has bearing upon the changes that were

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

brought about by the City of Lockhart, it's the city's

2

position that the changes that were brought about had a

3

retrogressive impact, first based upon an improper legal

4

standard, but secondly, they're not supportable under

5

the record anyway.

6

The finding that adoption of two new seats

7

using numbered places and using an off-year election has

8

retrogressive impact under the Beer decision is just

9

almost indefensible.

And I know that's very strong

10

language, but it doesn't make logical sense in the sense

11

of what you would intuitively expect if you enlarge a

12

city's governing body and the impact that that would

13

have on the electabilit of a minority.

14

It doesn't make sense with respect to the

15

evidence that was before the court.

10

before the court which was based upon a proper standard

17

of review — that is, compare the system in effect

18

before and the system in effect after and make your

19

decision based upon that — was the evidence from Dr.

20

Delbert Taebel, an expert in the area, who said.

21

Enlarging a city's governing body, based upon my

22

studies, generally has a positive impact upon the

23

electability of an Hispanic minority.

24

and their exhibits in the court below are in the record,

25

which demonstrate that that is so.

The only evidence

And he has tables

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Now, he didn’t do an incremental study going

2

from two to three or three to four or six to seven; he

3

grouped them in sizes, small councils, medium councils

4

and large councils and he abstracted his conclusion from

5

that.

But nevertheless, the conclusion is there.

6
7

QUESTION;

that orally or in affidavit form?

8
9

Mr. Mizell, was his testimony — is

It was presented orally.

subject to cross examination.

He was

His conclusion was that

10

enlarging the charter didn’t have just a neutral —

11

excuse me, elarging the city’s governing body was not

12

just neutral in impact; that enlarging it has a positive

13

impact on the minority chances for election.

14

And even though you do it in the context of

15

numbered places, as the new places, or in the context of

10

a staggered term, that, he says, does not erase the

17

positive impact that that has on the electability of a

18

minority.

19

The government's expert witness never made the

20

comparison in a proper way.

21

third expert witness testified — that would be Dr.

22

Cervantes who was the intervenor’s witness — in

23

response to questions by Judge Pratt below stated that

And to the extent that the

he said.

2

Doesn’t hurt you but it doesn’t help you.
So if you're comparing it under the proper

3

standard, as we have presented it here, there is no

4

evidence from the expert testimony of any adverse impact.

5

The final thing, and the government points

6

this up in its brief quite clearly, you don’t have to

7

worry about political theory or anything like that in

8

determining the impact of the charter system in Lockhart.

9

All you have to do is look at the record of

10

minority participation in this town and you’ll see that

11

since 1970 voter registration — 70 is the only — we

12

don’t have a figure for 1973 or we’d tie it down a

13

little closer.

14

believe it is that show that voter registration has

15

increased tremendously in the minority population in

16

Lockhart.

17

tremendously.

18

increased tremendously since the charter was adopted.

19

And finally, in 1978, we actually had a member of the

20

Mexican American community elected to office on the city

21

council and he remains in office today since we haven’t

22

had any other elections.

23

We have figures from 1970 through 77, I

Voter participation has increased
The number of minority candidates has

So you have logic which demands, I would

24

submit, demands a finding that adoption of the charter

25

had positive impact.

You have the expert testimony

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

which says it's positive or at worst, neutral

2

you have the actual experience.

3

position that the court below just got off on the wrong

4

track and ended up using the wrong standard of

5

comparison.

6

QUESTION;

And then

So it’s the city’s

Are you going to get to the

7

suggestion that the amendment to Section 2 has an impact

8

on this case?

9
10
11

ME. MIZELLs

Well, that certainly has been —

there has been a flurry of activity on that point.
QUESTION;

Isn’t there — if the law has been

12

changed in a way that affects this case, don’t we have

13

to judge this case based on the current law rather than

14

On some prior law?

15

MR. MIZELL:

16

QUESTION*

I would not contest that point.
I’m not suggesting that the change

17

does have an impact, but the argument is that Section 2

18

means that even if this was not a regressive change, you

19

must nevertheless — it must nevertheless pass muster

20

under Section 2.

21

MR. MIZELL;

I understand that to be the

22

argument, and I would make two responses to that.

23

of all, if you look at the legislative history behind

24

the adoption of Section 2, it’s got some 40-odd pages

25

that talk about the purpose of Section 2 being basically

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

to revise the standard which this Court set out in the

City of Mobile versus Eoulden.

3

exhausting detail about the pre-Boulden law and

4

post-Boulden law.

5

clearly demonstrate that.

6

And they go into

They were aiming at that and they

Now, you do have a footnote, it's a sort of

7

casual aside almost, that says that Section 2 standards

8

MR. MIZELLs

The purpose of Section 5, as I

17

understand it, was to allow a quick administrative

18

review through the Justice Department, and a hearing if

19

necessary before the District Court of the District of

20

Columbia on a very limited nature.

standards are much more exhaustive than the kind of

Yes.
Well, I have one more point on

16

that, Mr. Justice White, which I'd like to suggest.

17

Beer, there's a footnote in 96 Supreme Court, 1364 and

18

some language in there that deals with the

19

constitutional inquiry under Section 5.

20

first read the Section 2 suggestion it worried me a lot,

21

but basically, Section 2 as I understand it was to

22

reinstate the constitutional standards which the

23

Congress believed existed prior to both.

If you plug that understanding back into

made had they wanted to, but they didn't make it, in

this case, in the district court below.

Robinson says — and this is in the very ending of his

dissenting opinion — he says nobody anywhere in this

I'm not saying there is either, but it's certainly

possible.

13

MR. MIZELLt

I can only say that it is my

14

understanding from reviewing Section 2*s history from

15

the House and Senate records that what they were trying

16

to do was restate the same standards that had previously

existed under the constitutional guidelines laid down in

MR. MIZELL:

It would be the city's position

that if there were violations of the sort that would

have raised the constitutional issue below, they should

have been raised then, and it shouldn't be raised now,

12

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

13
14

MR. GARZA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and if it

please the Court:

15

I'd like to address a few of the things that

16

counsel for the appellants has raised in regard to the

litigation in Texas.

the orders that were issued in Texas, that the court

there never prohibited the city from reverting to the

of objection from the Department of Justice and it

prohibited elections pursuant to an election system

within the charter.

It is our position, in terms of

It parrotted the letter

Additionally, the district court below never
ruled on the illegality or the legality of using

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

numbered posts in the prior existing election system.

2

And in fact, the district court in this case below did

3

not base its finding of the legality or its finding on

4

that issue on any ruling out of the Texas court.

5

simply not the case.

6

That’s

Additionally, some of the facts that I think

7

this Court ought to consider that were established in

8

the court below in determining the backdrop upon which

9

the lower court reviewed the election change are several

10

points.

11

First of all, the record below shows that the

12

community in Lockhart is a divided community;

13

substantial segregated housing patterns exist and were

14

brought up during the trial.

15

racially polarized voting in the election system in

16

Lockhart.

17

There is a high degree of

And I agree with counsel for the appellants

18

that one need not theorize about the impact of this

election structure.

20

conducted using the post-charter election system upon

21

which one can measure the impact of that election

22

structure on the Mexican American community and the

23

minority community in Lockhart.

24
25

There are six elections that were

In those six elections, seven Mexican
Americans have run for office; only one has won.

On the other

4

What's significant in this situation is that

5

you would expect a drop-off in success rate for Anglos

because they opposed each other in some elections.

There were no Mexican Americans that opposed each other.

8

Significant also in that situation is that

Anglo candidates, in fact, ran unopposed during that

tenure.

tenure.

12

No Mexican American ran unopposed during that

Another point I think, that's important in

13

determining what are the issues before this Court, I

think it is an issue whether there was an election

in council size.

of the election change that occurred, is that no longer

to do that.

No longer will the minority community have the

Now, I think what’s interesting here, too, is

15

that the City of Lockhart has, in fact, passed a

16

resolution calling for elections in April, without

mention as to whether it will use numbered posts.

18

in fact, has requested of its city attorney that it

issue a legal opinion as to whether the numbered post

20

can be legally implemented in the April 1983 election

system.

22

And

The evidence before the court on that issue

23

not only involved, as I said, the review of Texas law,

but also involved the testimony of Riley Fletcher, who

25

is the general counsel of the Municipal League in Texas.

Do you think Congress really

far away from the District of Columbia to have the

judges presumably have no expertise in the law of Texas,

6

to pass on questions of state law as well as questions

of federal arising under the Voting Rights Act?

8

MR. GARZA;

I think that the District Court in

9

Washington, D.C. has a duty to examine what the

10

discriminatory impact of an election change is.

11

doing that, must analyze that system against what is

12

authorized under Texas law.

presumed valid unless shown to be otherwise.

22

MR. GARZA;

I think what's significant in

that. Justice Rehnquist, is just having the challenge,

24

just having the possibility that that system is illegal

MR. GARZA;

There is no certainty that they

will use the numbered post provision in those elections.

There is no certainty that you will

They have — yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Garza, though, did not the

recent order by the district court in Texas indicate

10

that they were free to use the old system, which would

11

include numbered posts?

12

MR. GARZA;

They were — the restraining order

13

did not prohibit them from using it.

14

Under the charter.

16

Texas I assume felt that their jurisdiction only went to

that.

unpre-cleared election change.

That's right.

That's — the district court in

future what they last did in the past, they would be

MR. GARZA;

But we would have — if there is

no pre-clearance of the charter, we would have the

opportunity to go into Texas state courts, and I think

the charter is pre-cleared.

6

QUESTION:

We do not have that

Mr. Garza, certainly there is

7

language in the Perkins case that would indicate that

8

what the court should look at in the Section 5 review is

9

the system actually being employed, rather than

10

something that perhaps was mandated by state law that’s

11

different.

12

Isn’t that true?
MR. GARZA:

Yes.

I think in analyzing Perkins

13

we must look at the underlying, underpinning purpose of

14

the ruling in Perkins.

15

situation where they’re trying to make a system comply

16

with the law in New Orleans, in Louisiana, that they had

17

to get pre-clearance.

18

In fact, Perkins said that in a

That’s what we're saying in Texas.

In addition, the Perkins court specifically

19

said that they were not going to allow political

20

jurisdiction subject to Section 5 to profit by its prior

21

illegal activity.

22

situation that we cannot challenge the legality or

23

cannot base the election change from illegal to legal in

24

this situation would have just the opposite impact, that

25

the Perkins court sought to avoid.

An additional point I think that needs to be

2

made in terms of the retrogressive impact of the

3

election change in Lockhart is the use of staggered

4

terms for the first time.

5

reveals that staggered terms result in lowering the

6

voter turnout generally.

7

that when there is lower voter turnout, it impacts

8

disproportionately upon the minority community.

And testimony also reveals

That, in fact, is the record in Lockhart.

population.

In

And that was an additional reason for the

Finally, I think the final point in this

15

situation is that Section 2, even if there is no

16

retrogression, Section 2 would preclude a

pre-clearance.

18

was referred to earlier I think is quite clear that if

19

there is on retrogression, the election system can still

20

be measured under the results test that was developed

21

for the amendment of Section 2.

22

about the going beyond retrogression standard and

23

insuring that an election system is not unconstitutional.

The Senate Report in the footnote that

constitutional standard.

on Section 2 and the footnote.

retrogression standard but also, the results standard

Ani I think it would be

QUESTIONj

the debate on

And Congressman Edwards,

Mr. Garza, is that really a very

satisfactory way of interpreting legislation?

You have

10

a Section 5 which has, in the past, been addressed to

11

the kind of situations involved in this case.

12

2, which has traditionally been addressed to the Bolden

13

case.

14

apparently being to change the result in Bolden.

15

Section 5 is left absolutely alone, and to say that a

16

footnote in the legislative history means that Section 5

17

was intended to be changed while Section 2, when the

18

language of Section 5 wasn't changed, strikes me as

19

something that probably escaped an awful lot of the

20

members of Congress who thought they were voting on the

21

bill.

22

Section

Section 2 has amended — the primary purpose

MB. GARZAi

Well, I think it's consistent with

23

the purpose of Section 5.

24

Section 5 was to avoid lengthy litigation based on the

25

constitutional standard, or the Section 2 standard, by

One of the purposes of

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

1

having this kind of review and assuring that an election

2

change does not have the discriminatory impact.

3

it would be consistent with that goal to interpret

4

Section 2 and the amendments to Section 2 --

5

QUESTION;

I think

Your suggestion is that both the

6

attorney general, if things are presented to him, and

7

the court must consider Section 2 in pre-clearance.

8

MR. GARZA;

9

QUESTION;

Yes.
And I take it that if the system is

10

to go ahead, it's going to have to pass muster under

11

both Section 5 and Section 2.

12

MR. GARZA;

I think that it must be shown to

13

the satisfaction to the district court that there is no

14

retrogression and that also, there is no discriminatory

15

result.

16

QUESTION;

So I take it, then, that if you

17

approach the Section 5 issue first, if you pre-clear it,

18

you’re nevertheless going to have to go to Section 2.

19

So what should you start with in a pre-clearance

20

proceeding; Section 2 or Section 5?

21

MR. GARZA;

I think the starting point is the

22

retrogression standard.

23

that, in fact, the election change does not have a

24

discriminatory result.

25

QUESTION;

But the court must determine

But which should you start with?

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

I

1

think it makes some difference; if Section 2 is really

2

the issue at the threshold, that issue certainly should

3

be decided by the district court first, before we do.

4

MR. GARZA*

I think the record in this case

5

supports a Section 2 violation in terms of just the

6

numbers showing that the system is not equally open to

7

members of the minority community, and that election

8

history has been --

9

QUESTION*

Yes, but shouldn't that argument be

10

made in the district court and not here, in the first

11

instance?

12

MR. GARZA*

13

QUESTION*

I think that would be proper.
If that's so, that would suggest if

14

you're right not an affirmance here but a remand,

15

wouldn *t it?

16

MR. GARZA*

I think the Court must find that

17

there has been no retrogression and the court below was

18

clearly erroneous in its conclusion.

19

fact, the case I think it would be proper for remand not

20

only on the intent question but also on the Section 2

21

question .

22

If that is, in

In summary, I’d like to point out a few

Do you have anything

15

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER H. MIZELL, ESQ.

16

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT — Rebuttal

17

MR. MIZELL*

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like

18

to just make a point or two in response to the questions

19

that were raised a moment ago.

20

Regarding Judge Garcia's ruling and the prior

21

situation that Xockhart was in regarding elections, the

22

appendix to the Jurisdictional Statement contains the

23

key finding by the district court in Texas below where

24

it says among the major — this is page 6A, "Among the

25

major changes required by adoption of the charter was,

41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

among other things, adoption of the numbered-place

2

system."

This was the order that was entered in 1979.

3

QUESTION*

4

HR. KIZELLi

What page are you on there?
The appendix to the

5

Jurisdictional Statement, it's the -- it’s not the

6

record itself.

It's the initial — page 6A.

7

QUESTION;

8

HR. HIZELLs

And what's the point?
The point is that in the

Supplemental Brief we filed on page S4, finding number
10

11 is the corresponding paragraph in the order.

11

may compare the paragraph on page 6A at the bottom of

12

the first full paragraph, to that order and see the

13

change.

14

that were raised by both sides regarding the impact of

15

its prior order, and decided that the order initially

16

had listed numbered places as a change which should not

17

be used in subsequent elections.

And you

The district court considered all the arguments

In his order in 1982, Judge Garcia says

18

enlarging the city council and adopting staggered terms

20

are the changes.

21

today.

22

precisely as we did before prior to adoption of the

23

charter.

24
25

Just as we've argued here before you

And that allows us to continue with the system

QUESTION*

Well, the order on page S8

expressly says that you're allowed to conduct elections

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

2

pursuant to the pre-existing electoral system.
MR. MIZELL;

Your Honor, ray point is that when

3

counsel was standing here a moment ago, he suggested

4

that there was nothing that would preclude us from doing

5

it i the first place.

6

of the prior order on page 6A of the appendix to the

7

Jurisdictional Statement, together with the other

8

language which says you cannot conduct elections

9

pursuant to the charter, meant that the city could not

10

use numbered places, its old system, nor could it use

11

its new system.

12

clarification —

13
14

But the prior order, the language

And it sat there in limbo until the

QUESTION:

Well, there's no question that the

pre-existing electoral system used numbered places.

15

MR. MIZELL:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. MIZELL:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. MIZELL:

20

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And he expressly permits it.
He does in the 1982 order.
Yes.
But in 71 —
I know, but my interest is whether

21

he — whether we must assume that he considered the

22

legality of it under Texas law.

23

MR. MIZELL:

I can only go outside the record

24

to answer that, but it was fully briefed as vigorously

25

as either side knew how, on all issues.

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

QUESTIONS

Dogs that mean, Mr. Mizell, that

2

you take the position that as a matter of Texas law, a

3

general law city could use numbered posts?

4

MR. MIZELL*

We take that position initially,

5

yes.

6

more important — that it doesn't matter whether they

7

could or not.

We take the secondary position — and I think it's

8

9

QUESTION;

MS. MIZELLs

Certainly do.

But we didn't feel

like this was the appropriate —

12

13

But

you think that your opponent is wrong on Texas law.

10
11

I understand that position.

QUESTION;

You think Judge Garza — what was

his name?

14

MR. MIZELLs

15

QUESTION*

Judge Garcia.
That Judge Garcia must have thought

16

the numbered post system in a general law city was all

17

right?

18

MS. MIZELLs

I don't know whether he decided

19

that or whether he looked at the Voting Rights Act and

20

decided that whatever system was previously in place

21

could be carried forward.

22

both of those issues were presented to him.

23

QUESTION;

But I can tell the Court that

Is it clear whether he thought that

24

there was no coverage for purposes of Section 5 review

25

as a result of that, or that he looked at it and found

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

no retrogressive effect; that there was a coverage issue

2

but it wasn't retrogressive?

3
4

MR. MIZELLs

I don't think he was making a

determination about retrogression at all on that point.

5

QUESTION*

6

MR. MIZELL*

It's just an interim plan.
I think it was just an interim

7

plan.

8

forward, and he decided the old practice was appropriate.
