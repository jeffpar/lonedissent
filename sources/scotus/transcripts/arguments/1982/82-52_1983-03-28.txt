ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. ENDICOTT, ESQ.,

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ENDICOTT:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11

please the Court, this case presents some of the

12

questions that we believe were left unresolved by this

13

Court's decision in the Manhart case.
In Manhart, this Court was concerned with a

14
15

mandatory employer-operated pension fund which required

16

the women make larger contributions than men.

17

result was that a woman's take-home pay was smaller than

18

a man's.

19

Title 7, and we make no contention today that such

20

holding was erroneous.

21

The

This Court held that such a plan violated

But the Arizona Deferred Compensation Plan is

22

different in a number of respects.

In the Arizona plan,

23

independent insurance companies issue the life annuities

24

that are involved in this case.

25

the ones who determine the appropriate monthly payment

They, not Arizona, are

to be made based on the amount accumulated by the

2

employee and the age and the sex of that employee.
It is the insurance companies which developed

3
4

and use the sex-based actuarial tables which are in

5

issue here.

6

such tables, but nevertheless has been held responsible

7

for their use.

Arizona did not create or control or use

8

Arizona’s only intent was to make available to

9

its employees participating in its deferred compensation

10

plan the widest possible selection of payout methods,

11

including life annuities.

12

intend to treat its female employees less favorably than

13

its male employees.

14

QUESTION*

Arizona did not treat or

The Arizona plan —
Mr. Endicott, there is some

15

indication that Arizona at least solicited bids on the

16

basis of the sex-based tables --

17

HR. ENDICOTT:

18

QUESTION:

19

Yes, Justice —

— that it assumed that is what it

wanted and went out to get what in fact it got.
MR. ENDICOTT:

20

Justice O’Connor, it solicited

21

bids, and in the solicitation it asked for quotes on

22

males and females, but there was nothing to prevent

23

anybody from giving the same quote if there had been a

24

unisex table available and if the bidder had chosen to

25

do it .

And in any event, Arizona didn’t

ME. ENDICOTT:

3

No, Your Honor, but as Your

4

Honor may have observed from the various amici briefs

5

filed, nobody was offering it.

6

because it didn't want it or didn't intend it.

It never

8

QUESTION*

Yes, probably so.

QUESTION*

Who has the burden of proof on that?

MR. ENDICOTT;

10

11

on precisely what, Justice Blackmun?
QUESTION;

12

13

The burden of proof on what —

On whether unisex tables are

available or were available.
ME. ENDICOTT;

14

It is our position that the

15

burden of proof is upon the respondent, that it would

16

have been upon the plaintiffs in the lawsuit to prove,

17

because if the contention is that Arizona discriminated

18

by not seeking the use of unisex annuity tables, the

19

question would be Arizona discriminated because it

20

didn't ask for or take unisex annuity tables, I think,

21

just as in the other Title 7 cases where an employee who

22

contends he or she was discriminated against by not

23

being given a job, you must show that the job was

24

available.

25

Therefore, I think the burden. Your Honor, is

The employee

In fact,

10

the employee can do what he or she chooses with his or

11

her money, and it is our position that permitting

12

someone to do something is not discriminating against

13

someone.
In the Arizona plan, again, unlike Manhart,

14
15

the contributions are equal, equal in the sense that the

16

employee is free to make whatever contribution he or she

17

chooses.

18

male employee can contribute the same amount as any

employe receives.

There are minimum and maximum limits, but any

Again, therefore, there is no

In the Arizona plan, another distinction is,

23

there is no contribution by the employer.

The plan is

24

funded entirely by contributions by the employee, and as

25

a matter of fact, under the statute which created the

Now, there is a difference between the Arizona

5

deferred compensation plan and the Arizona retirement

plan.

8

and in that plan, where the plan is underwritten by the

9

employer, the payments are the same for male and female

10

That plan is funded by employer contributions,

employees.

11

Another distinction from Manhart under the

12

Arizona plan is that the Arizona plan offers various

13

options to the employees.

14

to them both in the form of the investment that is made

15

with their money while they are putting their money into

16

the plan, and in the form in which they take their money

17

out.

They have choices available

Manhart, is a lump sum payment.

result

2

ME. ENDICOTT;

There is a tax problem, Justice

3

Blackmun, no matter how you take your money out.

4

is a tax avoidance, a deferred tax plan, and Internal

5

Revenue gets you sooner or later, but Your Honor is

6

right if you are suggesting that if you take it out in a

7

lump, they get you somewhat sooner.

8
9

QUESTION i

This

I suppose your position is that if

you do not prevail in this lawsuit, that in effect the

10

plaintiffs have driven out of the picture the third

11

option.
ME. ENDICOTTs

12

Yes, Your Honor.

The state has

13

already removed that option from the plan, based upon

14

the decision of the District Court, which enjoined it

15

from continuing with sex-based actuarial tables.
QUESTION*

16
17
18

Sometimes we overlitigate, don’t

we?
MR. ENDICOTT*

I think so, Your Honor.

I

19

really -- I really think the result in this case proves

20

the error of the decision, because I think the result is

21

the worst possible result.

22

As I was saying, one of the choices of the

23

lump sum, and as Your Honor points out, there is a tax

24

consequence, there is a second choice, which is an

25

annuity for a fixed term.

You can say to the insurance

company, I want my money paid back to me over ten years,

2

fifteen years, twenty years, and again, in that example,

3

the male and the female are treated the same, because

4

you have removed the one risk that is involved in the

5

life annuity, which is the life expectancy.

So, under the lump sum option —

ORAL ARGUHENT OF JOHN I. ENDICOTT, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - CONTINUED
MR. ENDICOTT*

6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

7

please the Court, at the luncheon recess I was

8

discussing the options which are available under the

9

Arizona deferred compensation plan; and I had mentioned

10

the fact that the employees can select the lump sum

11

payment, a fixed term annuity, and the third option

12

which is available is the life annuity.
In that one, in the lump sum and the fixed

13
14

term, the treatment of males and females is equal.

They

15

both get the same lump sum payment or the same monthly

16

payment.

17

the payments are equal, but the monthly payments are

18

different.

19

it is that aspect of the annuity and the program which

20

has brought us here today.

In the life annuity, the actuarial values of

The woman gets a lower monthly payment, and

But nothing is available -- nothing was

21

22

available at the times here involved on the open market

23

which was more favorable to women in the form of life

24

annuities.

25

offerings truly reflect the open market, and the

I think it is fair to state that the plan

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

decisions of this Court in General Electric versus

2

Gilbert, Harris versus McRae, and indeed in Kanhart

3

itself, all hold that the employer is not responsible

4

for the fact that the open market may treat women

5

differently than it treats men.
Nothing makes it illegal for insurance

6
7

companies as opposed to employers, but nothing makes it

8

illegal for insurance companies to recognize the

9

different risks presented by men and women, and to treat

10

women according to the risks they present.
I sumbit also that this case is a misuse of

11
12

Title 7.

13

really with anything that Arizona has done as an

14

employer, but is with the insurance industry practice of

15

giving economic effect to the fact that women live

16

longer than men.

17

The plaintiffs* complaint in this case is not

The plaintiffs are using Title 7 in this case

18

to punish the employer for what the insurance industry

19

has done, third party insurers, and this Court in

20

Footnote 33 in Manhart said that Title 7 does not govern

21

the relations between employees and third parties.

22

governs relations between employers and employees, but

23

not with third parties.

The Manhart opinion suggested that if a
corporate shell was used, that was a different case, but

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

there is no evidence in this case that there is a'

2

corporate shell. The insurance companies are independent

3

and long-standing life insurance companies, third

4

parties.

5

Arizona.

The insurance companies are not the agents of

6

This Court held in General Building

7

Contractors fairly recently that one of the elements of

8

agency is the ability to control, and there is no

9

shoving that Arizona had the ability to control the

10
11

insurers in this case.
QUESTION*

Mr. Endicott, would your position

12

be the same if the insurance companies used tables based

13

on race rather than sex?

14

MR. ENDICOTT*

I have to answer your question

15

by going a little further. Justice Blackmun.

16

historically has been treated differently by the

17

Congress of this country, by this Supreme Court.

18

treated differently in the insurance industry by the

19

State Insurance Commissioners, who have — or the

20

states, rather, who have regulated insurance, have said,

21

you cannot consider race in insurance.

22

Race

I am not aware of any actuarial data that

23

would give you a statistical basis or support for

24

treating people differently on the basis of race.

25

It is

QUESTION*

Well, there are diseases that are

440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

suffered more by persons of one race than another

2

classic example is sickle cell anemia, of course.

3

Comfetis is another.

4

as much justification for an insurance company to set up

5

tables on the basis of race because of the presence of

6

those special risks.

And I suppose there would be just

MS. ENDICOTT;

7

The

In a health insurance plan, a

8

medical benefits plan, that could come up.

As I say, it

9

really can't in our context because of the state laws

10

that preclude it, and again, because there are no

11

actuarial studies that I am aware of that indicate one

12

race lives longer than the other —
QUESTION*

13

Well, if you go back about two

14

decades, you will find a whole slew of actuarial tables

15

based on race, promoted by two of the biggest insurance

16

companies in this country.
ME. ENDICOTT*

17

But I think in recent times,

18

Justice Marshall, that those statistics are changing for

19

the better.

I don’t know whether they are still there or not.
MR. ENDICOTT;

track of it any more, Justice Marshall.

2

live longer than men.

3
4

QUESTION:

Would it be allowable under Title

7, though, I think, is the question.

5

MR. ENDICOTT:

I think the answer to that,

6

Justice O'Connor, is who was making the distinction.

7

in this case it were a third party independent insurance

company —

QUESTION;

If

If it were an insurance company, as

we have here.

11

MR. ENDICOTT;

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. ENDICOTT:

And that was what was —

On the basis of race.
And that was what was available

14

and offered on the open market?

15

the employer's responsibility.

16

decisions of this Court in GE-Gilbert, Harris-KcRae,

17

Manhart, if that problem exists, that is in my opinion a

18

social, political problem that needs to be corrected by

19

either the Congress or the states who have historically

20

regulated the insurance industry.

21

should use Title 7 for it.

22

QUESTION;

I don't think that's
I think under the

I don't think you

May I ask you another question or

23

two while you are interrupted?

The record shows, I

24

believe, that by August of '78, four women had retired

25

on a lifetime annuity under the Arizona plan.

QUESTIONi

MR. ENDICOTT:

QUESTION:

It is now terminated, and so we are

dealing with four women.
MR. ENDICOTT:

8
9

They can’t select the life

annuity because —

6
7

Have any other women in the

plaintiff class retired and selected that annuity?

4
5

Yes, Your Honor

And the future male and female

who would like to retire and get a life annuity.

10

QUESTION:

If the plan were reinstituted.

11

MR. ENDICOTT:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

If the Court were to affirm the

13

court below, and you had to discuss prospective

14

remedies, what would your position be on the remedy

15

question?

16

HR. ENDICOTT:

I am very troubled by the

17

retroactive aspect of the relief that was ordered in

18

this case, and by other aspects, such as ordering the

19

state to pay money when the state plan says that this is

20

an employee plan only, but the retroactive aspect is

21

troublesome because plans not so much like Arizona,

22

where no funds are put up by the employer, but plans

23

that have been funded such as are described in the

24

Florida amicus brief in this case, they have funded a

25

plan on certain actuarial assumptions.

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

They were at one time $4 billion in debt.

2

They have got their plan actuarially sound now.

They

3

recognize the difference between men and women.

And if

4

you fashion relief which says that as of the date of

5

this decision or the trial court’s decision you now have

6

to pay those people an amount you never funded and

7

reserved for, I think, you may bankrupt and render

8

insolvent a lot of employer-funded plans.

9

As I say, it isn’t so critical in Arizona,

10

because of, as Your Honor points out, the small number

11

of people involved, and really the small dollars

12

involved, but it again is why I think that if there is

13

to be a change ordered in the practices of the insurance

14

companies, and that is what your question really

15

assumes, it should be done by a legislative body who

16

holds hearings, takes evidence, studies the facts, and

17

determines what they can do without bankrupting the

18

pension and insurance industry in this country.

19

And I don’t think the record before this Court

20

is adequate for that purpose.

21

QUESTION*

Putting aside the retroactive

22

relief for the moment, do you know if unisex insurance

23

is available?

24

kind of a policy, a different kind of an annuity?

25

Could they buy insurance, a different

MR. ENDICOTTi

2

QUESTIONS

Are there such annuities available

on the market?
MB. ENDICOTTs

3

There are unisex annuities

4

being offered presently, as I understand some of the

5

statements made in the amicus brief, and as I understand

6

Chinnerly, but. Your Honor, you have to define what

7

unisex means.

8

around as though it had a fixed and certain meaning, and

9

I don't think it really does.

Unisex is a word that everybody throws

The statements that you

10

are seeing, and one of them was made in one of the

11

briefs, was that, for example, Lincoln National Life

12

said, we will write a unisex annuity if it is a large

13

enough group and they take into consideration the

14

makeup, the sexual makeup of the group.
You start with the fact women do live longer

15
16

than men.

Therefore, when you reserve, you have got to

17

assume you are going to pay more money to women than you

18

are to men.

19

that way.

20

you've got to define the group of people you're

21

insuring, know the sexual and age makeup of it, and do

22

it.

Therefore, you've got to fund your plan
So, when they talk about unisex annuities,

23

QUESTION:

24

MB. ENDICOTT:

25

Yes.
Under the Arizona plan, Your

Honor, it could not be done, because it is a voluntary

2

lump sum.

3

what will happen is, presumably, all the men will opt

4

out and go buy a sex-based annuity on the open market,

5

where they get a better return, all the women will stay

6

in, and the unisex rate in the plan will be the female

7

rate because they are insuring 100 percent female.

8
9

People can opt in or out, and they can withdraw a
You can’t fund that kind of plan, because

QUESTION;

Well, assume that the insurance

companies had such an annuity available, and the

10

employer didn’t buy that one, he bought the one that’s

11

in Option 3.

12

13

What about the employer then?

HR. ENDICOTT;

If the unisex annuity that was

offered was better than the sax segregated rate --

14

QUESTION;

Well, but that, of course —

15

HR. ENDICOTT;

No, if it offered to pay the

16

woman more money per month than the sex-based table.

17

That’s how I define better.

18

per month under the sex-based -- under the unisex

19

No, Your Honor, not generally,

and not basically, they don't.

It is age and sex that

6

are the two stable -- my understanding of risk,

7

classificaion, which is what insurance is primarily

8

involved with, is that in classifying risks, you have

got to have factors that are stable, permanent, and

practical, and you can look at smoking, you can look at

eating, you can look at the person's weight, you can

But in the group policy context,

HR. ENDICOTT;

I believe in the group policy

context, to the extent I am aware of it. Your Honor, it

6

makes no difference, and the whole purpose of group is

7

to underwrite a large group of people cheaply, usually

8

without medical examinations, usually without much

9

medical history.

If they work in'the group, the law of

10

large numbers works, and you treat the people according

11

to the fact that they are an element of the group.

12

gives you a problem with treating people individually,

13

but you treat them as a unit of the group.

I am always concerned

Yes, but you can pick a

states that have systems comparable to Arizona?
MR. ENDICOTT;

Deferred compensation plans,

Your Honor.

Yes.

MR. ENDICOTT*

I believe there are a number.

18

Arizona was one of the first to do it, but there are a

19

number that have it, and almost all states have

20

retirement or pension plans, of course.

21

As I said much earlier in answer to a

22

question, I think the best evidence of the error of this

23

decision is the result.

24

trial court in this case, the employees in Arizona had a

25

choice of what they could buy with their money, and one

Before the decision by the

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

of those choices was a life annuity, and those people

2

who thought they would live long enough to make that

3

profitable were free to make that choice.

4

How, as a result of the decision in this case,

5

the only result has been, we have removed the choice

6

from the plan, and we were enjoined to do, and the

7

employees of the state of Arizona have less choices than

8

they had before.

9

QUESTION;

But does it necessarily follow that

10

that has to be a permanent solution?

11

least theoretically possible — maybe you won't do it —

12

that you could in the future adopt a unisex program.
fiR» ENDICOTT;

13

I suppose it is at

Under our -- under the Arizona

14

plan, where people have a choice of options. Justice

15

Stevens, and where they don't need to make a decision

16

until they're 65 and retire, the odds are, as I said

17

earlier, that I think you would end up with a female

18

table being used to create the unisex rate because the

19

insurer would have to assume the worst possible case,

20

and that is that he is going to have 100 percent female

21

life annuitants, and he is going to use the female

22

rate.

23

So, you haven't, I don't think, accomplished
much in that way.
In conclusion, then, I would like to say that

I think it is clear that Arizona — Arizona did not

discriminate against its women employees by offering

3

them the opportunity to purchase a life annuity through

be reversed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMY JO GITTLER, ESQ.,

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. GITTLER:

12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

13

please the Court, in City of Los Angeles Department of

14

Hater and Power versus Manhart, this Court held that an

15

employer's use of gender-based actuarial tables in

16

computing payments into a pension plan was unlawful

17

under Title 7.

18

challenged today.

The holding in that case is not

Rather, Your Honors, the issue in this case is

19

20

whether an employer can be absolved of liability under

21

Title 7 because it contracts out with a third party to

22

provide a life annuity benefit to employees or because

23

there are alternative non-discriminatory options

24

available.

25

no.

The answer to that question is unequivocally

statement inferred, is not sitting there with the money

in his hot little hand and making money off it.

5

case?

6

MS. GITTLERs

Isn't that the

Certainly, Justice O'Connor,

7

that is what the employer would like us to believe

8

today, but the employer's involvement is far more

9

extensive than that.

The employer is the one that

10

determines where the money will in fact go, and although

11

the employee can indicate a preference as to how the

12

money should be invested, it is the employer which

13

ultimately has the discretion to accept or reject that

14

preference.

15

QUESTIONS

Yes, but that has nothing to do

16

with title to the money.

17

sort of an argument, is it not?

18

MS. GITTLER;

I mean, that is a different

Justice O'Connor, it is, but the

19

point is, it is one of the many indicia of the control

20

that the employer exercises in this plan.

21

QUESTION:

Who has the burden of proof, as

22

Justice Blackmun asked earlier, that unisex tables were

23

in fact available?

24
25

MS. GITTLERs

Your Honor, the issue of the

burden of proof in this case is really a bogus issue,

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

because in this case we are dealing, Justice O'Connor,

2

with an explicit sex-based classification, and the

3

burden of proof with respect to the existence or

4

non-existence of unisex tables is irrelevant for these

5

purposes, because once we have shown that there is an

6

explicit sex-based classification, that is all that we

7

need to show.

8
9

10
11

Manhart teaches us —

QUESTION;

But you do concede that you have

the burden, the respondents as plaintiffs had the burden
of proof initially, right?
MS. GITTLER;

That’s correct. Your Honor, and

12

our burden in this case was met when we established that

13

in fact there was an explicit sex-based classification,

14

and Manhart teaches us that once there is an explicit

15

sex-based classification based upon actuarial tables, as

16

in this case, that the employer is liable under Title 7,

17

and none of the bases upon which the employer now seeks

18

to absolve itself of liability are sufficient to allow

19

it to remove the mandate and the prohibitions

20

established by Congress under Title 7.

21

The nexus between the employer and the

22

employee is here.

It is the employer which has created

23

the plan, and it is the employer that has provided the

24

employee with the fringe benefit, and once the employer

25

undertakes to provide an employee with a fringe benefit,

31
ALDERS0N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

Title 7 states that it must provide it in a

2

non-discriminatory fashion.
QUESTION;

3
4

Are they compelled to participate?

Are the employees compelled to participate in this plan?
MS. GITTLER;

5

No, Chief Justice Burger.

This

6

is a voluntary plan.

But that factor does not in any

7

way mitigate against the employer's liability.

8

does not draw lines between voluntary and involuntary,

9

and numerous facets of the employment setting are

Title 7

10

voluntary, but that fact alone does not in any way bear

11

upon an employer's liability or obligation to provide

12

non-discriminatory benefits.
QUESTION;

13
14

classification here?
MS. GITTLER;

15
16

It was explicit gender-based

classification between men and women, and the parties -QUESTION;

17
18

What was the explicit sex

How was that evidenced?

Can you

read that anywhere in the plan?
MS. GITTLER:

19

You can read it. Your Honor, in

20

the very contracts that have been signed.

21

have stipulated in the Joint Appendix that the payments

22

that women receive and men receive are based upon

It is the result of the insurance

MS. GITTLERs

4

So

It is as a result of the

5

contracts that tha stata has entered into with the

6

insurance companies that creates this discrimination,

7

but the mere fact that they have contracted with these

8

insurance companies is not sufficient to eliminate the

9

liability.

10

QUESTIONS

The employer didn't ask insurance

11

companies to bid based on gender-based annuity.

12

didn't put out a specification, please bid on the basis

13

of distinguishing between men and women.

14

MS. GITTLERs

They

Your Honor, as we establish or

15

argue in our brief, Exhibit H to the first set of

16

interrogatories in fact suggests that there was an

17

actual overt solicitation for bids broken down by men

18

and women, and even so, regardless of whether there was

19

an overt solicitation, the employer was not compelled to

20

provide this kind of discrimination.

21

argument of compulsion in this case, but, Your Honors,

22

the employer had an option in this case.

23

decide not to provide the non-discriminatory option, or

24

it could self-insure, and either of those options were

25

viable options.

There is some

It could

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

discriminatory option which on its face discriminates

2

month to month against women.

3

QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Gittler, what if the

4

employer had self-insured in this case.

5

that in that context, the employer could have made no

6

allowance for the difference in longevity between men

7

and women?
MS. GITTLER:

8

9

Rehnquist.

Is your idea

That's correct. Justice

As this Court held in Manhart, which was a

10

self-insured, program, that the employer was precluded

11

from basing the benefits or, in Manhart, the

12

contributions, in this case the benefits on the basis of

13

sex-segegrated actuarial tables.
QUESTION:

14

Wouldn't the result, if the

15

employer had done that, be very much as Mr. Endicott

16

predicted in the unisex policies, that there would be no

17

men applicants for this particular self-insurance policy

18

that you are mentioning, and that the only applicants

19

would be women, and they would end up paying the female

20

rate?

21

MS. GITTLER*

That is not correct. Justice

22

Rehnquist, because under this particular plan in

23

particular, it is an attractive plan to employees

24

because of the significant tax benefits.

25

QUESTION*

Employees —

Well, but presumably an employee

2

which you say he must have, or talcing the money that it

3

would cost to pay premiums in that and go to an

4

insurance company which does rate on the basis of

gender, the men are going to go to an insurance company

discrimination?
MS. GITTLERa

Chief Justice Burger, if it was

15

done in the context of an employer providing the fringe

16

benefit, and that is what we are talking about today, an

17

insurance company in the abstract out in the market is

18

not susceptible to Title 7 in this conext, but if an

19

employer undertakes to provide life insurance, for

20

example, to an employee, then again Manhart teaches us

21

that the amounts that are paid in or the amounts that

22

are paid out could not be based upon aggregates, cannot

23

be based upon sex-segregated actuarial tables.

24
25

QUESTION:

Ms. Gittler, may I ask you a

question about burden of proof?

Your opponent suggests

36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that if we talk, in terms of a unisex table, that there

2

would be a natural selection that would drive the market

3

to select the female rate.

4

understand you, by saying, well, even a female rate

5

might be better for the male because of the tax

6

consequences of the lump sum payment plus the group

7

purchasing power.
Now, we don’t really know whether that is true

8
9

You have responded, as I

or not.

Who has the burden of proof on that question?

10

Do you understand what I am asking you?

11

or not you are correct in saying in substance the unisex

12

plan would be more favorable to both men and women,

13

whereas he is saying, no, no, we can just think it

14

through and it would inevitably be a female, an

15

all-female plan.
MS. GITTLER*

16

As to whether

Justice Stevens, I don’t think

17

that that’s an issue that either party needs to

18

necessarily prove one way or the other, because once

19

they have undertaken to provide a sex-discriminatory

20

plan, whether or not there might be some adverse

21

consequeces of this Court holds that Title 7 applies is

22

not really relevant to the issue of liability under

23

Title 7.

24
25

QUESTION*

In other words, you are saying that

if there is a violation of law, even if establishing the

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

violation hurts women generally, that is just an

2

unfortunate consequence of the statute.

3

MS. GITTLEP;

Your Honor, there are always

4

going to be consequences of this Court's decisions, and

5

if in fact — for instance, Mr. Endicott suggested that

6

the consequence if this Court were to uphold the Ninth

7

Circuit, he has suggested that the effect would be to

8

completely eliminate the plan.

9

QUESTION;

Correct.

MS. GITTLERs

10

That is always a risk, that is

11

taken. Your Honor.

An employer can evade responsibility

12

and avoid liability under Title 7 by having no

employees.

14

Court to find that there is no liability or that Section

15

703(a) does not apply to this employer and prohibit the

16

particular practice that is involved in this case.

17

Now, there is also some discussion. Your

18

Honors, about the options, and as Justice Blackmun

19

pointed out, the lump sum option does come with

20

significant tax consequences.

21

millions of other employees and retirees throughout the

22

country, the only feasible option under this plan is the

23

annuity option.

But that is not a sufficient basis for this

2

they want for their entire retirement life.

3

significantly, Your Honors, there is no legal precedent

4

or basis for absolving an employer under Title 7 because

5

there are non-discriminatory options available.

6

fact —

QUESTION:

Even more

And in

The irony of affirming if a state

is to continue, though, to provide an annuity plan after

an affirmance is that in order to avoid disparate

10

treatment of women by mandating unisex tables, it will

11

have a disparate impact on men to achieve it.

12

want to comment on that?

13

MS. GITTLERs

Yes, Justice O’Connor.

Do you

The

14

Court in Manhart specifically addressed that issue in a

15

footnote in which the Court observed that not every

16

disparate impact creates a violation of Title 7, and

17

indeed -- the issue was raised with respect to the

18

potential unfairness, and incorporated into that in

19

Manhart was the issue of the potential illegality, but

20

Manhart teaches us that not every disparate impact is

21

going to create — under the Griggs analysis is going to

22

create a violation of Title 7.

23

Unfairness was one of the arguments that was

24

raised over and over again in Manhart and was explicitly

25

rejected, not only on policy but also on the legal

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 626-9300

y
1

bases .

In addition, this Court has held, last term,

2

under Connecticut versus Teal, that an employer is not

3

justified in discriminating in one aspect solely because

4

it does not discriminate in another aspect, and this

5

argument made by the employer today sounds very similar

6

to the argument that was rejected by this Court in

7

Connecticut versus Teal.
In addition, in Mississippi versus Hogan, this

8
9

Court held that an explicit sex-based classification

10

under -- could not be justified under the Fourteenth

11

Amendment, the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth

12

Amendment solely because there happened to be other

13

non-discriminatory options available.
Thus, Your Honors, not only is there a

14
15

question of policy in terms of the feasibility of the

16

alternative options that are available, but there is

17

simply no legal basis for absolving this employer of

18

liability solely because there are alternative

19

non-discriminatory options available.
QUESTION;

If your position is the correct

21

one, what should inform the Court's selection of

22

remedies, Ms. Gittler?

what should inform the Court's decision on remedial

action?

case.

paid to men — to women less than men, and the Court

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

is that Congress has spoken, and we are dealing here

2

with the statute, and I think that.is important to

emphasize, the statutory prohibitions, and the statute

4

prohibits treating individuals as members of a class,

5

and that's what this Court has held in interpreting

Title 7.

7

How, in terms of the remedy which was raised

by Justice O'Connor, Mr. Endicott has also — has

essentially conceded that in this particular case there

is really a minimal amount that is involved, and there

11

is really -- there are only four employees that have

12

retired under the stipulated facts.

13

As Mr. Endicott stated, the amount that may be

14

involved is de minimis, and in fact. Your Honors, the

15

state in this case never obtained a stay of the order of

the District Court, and so clearly experience must

indicate that in fact the state has been able to comply

with the order.

issues that might be raised by other employers.

— if the employer does not provide the

non-discriminatory option, there may, Your Honor, be

other issues with respect to contract or other problems

10

with respect to the suspension of the option, but if an

11

employer responds by not providing this particular

fringe benefit, that in itself is not a violation except

as it may bear on employees who are already

participating in the plan or who have already retired.

Chief Justice Burger, you asked with respect

under this plan which charges women less because they

are woman in the payment of life insurance.

of no particular provision under this which allows for

charging women less because they are women.

MS. GITTLERi

3

Your Honor, again, that would be

4

discrimination, but I was responding more to Mr.

5

Endicott's suggestion that there was a life insurance

6

program under this particular plan which charged women

7

less, and I know of no such separate provision unless it

8

is included in one of the other options.

be cured if they added a fourth option which was a life

18

That would in no way affect the outcome in

In addition, there is an argument that is made

19

by the petitioners of the actuarial equivalents, and

20

that in fact women are receiving the same in the

21

aggregate as men in the aggregate, and Your Honors, that

22

is the very heart of the argument that was rejected by

23

this Court in Manhart, and cannot be relitigated before

24

this Court again.

25

Nathalie Norris will receive less month to

47

AIDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

month than a similarly situated man, and that is what

2

Manhart proscribes.

3

In addition, there was a suggestion made by

4

Mr. Endicott that this merely reflects the open market,

5

and that this somehow falls within the term open market

6

that this Court referred to in Manhart, but there, this

7

Court held that an employer can give an employee a lump

8

sum amount and go out and buy whatever he or she can on

9

the open market.

That is not this case.

This case

10

involves an employer who has itself provided the

11

benefits to the employees, and has not suggested that

12

the employer — that the employee go out into the open

13

market simply with a dollar amount in its hand.
The issue, Your Honors, in this case is one of

14
15

statutory construction.

Congress has determined the

16

scope, the applicability of Title 7, and its

17

prohibitions, and in this case the employer has violated

18

Title 7 by providing a discriminatory fringe benefit to

its employees.

companies or the presence of the options in this case

are sufficient to overcome the statutory prohibition of
