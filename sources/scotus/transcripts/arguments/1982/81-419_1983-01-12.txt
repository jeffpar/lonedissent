ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. CHRIS MARSHALL, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MARSHALL:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is before the Court on a writ of

10

11

ceritorari directed to the Court of Criminal Appeals of

12

Texas.
In 1979 respondent Clifford James Brown was

13
14

charged with a second degree felony offense under state

15

law of possession of a controlled substance.

16

charge stemmed from an incident in which respondent was

17

found in possession of a tied-off balloon containing

18

heroin.

19

This

Respondent moved to suppress the heroin on the

20

grounds that it was the product of an illegal

21

warrantless seizure, and after an evidentiary hearing in

22

the trial court, the motion to suppress was denied.

23

Respondent then entered a plea of nolo contendre to the

24

charge, reserving under state procedures his right to

25

appeal the seizure question; and he was sentenced to

1

four years'

imprisonment.

On appeal a three-judge panel of the Court of

2
3

Criminal Appeals of Texas reversed the conviction,

4

holding that this warrantless seizure of the knotted

5

balloon violated the plain view doctrine as announced in

6

Coolidge v. New Hampshire.
The theory below was that for the contraband

7
8

nature of that balloon to have been "immediately

9

apparent" to the officer as required by Coolidge, the

10

officer had to know what was inside the balloon.

11

the opinion of the Court of Criminal Appeals, because

12

this balloon was opaque, the officer obviously could not

13

see inside the balloon and could not have known what was

14

inside.

15

improper.

16

And in

Therefore, they found the seizure to be

The State of Texas filed a motion for

17

rehearing or a request for rehearing, but that motion

18

for leave to file was denied by the en banc court, three

19

of those nine judges filing a written dissent to that.

20

It was the belief of these dissenters that probable

21

cause, not knowledge, was the standard to which the

22

seizing officer was held, and that when proper regard

23

was given to the inferences that this experienced

24

officer was able to draw when he saw the balloon,

25

probable causa was evident, and the seizure was proper.

1

To amplify on the facts of the seizure, on

2

June 18th, 1979, Fort Worth police officer Tom Maples

3

and other members of the Patrol Division had set up a

4

roadblock-type of driver's license check.

5

checking, stopping each vehicle that came through this

6

roadblock, checking the drivers for driver’s licenses

7

and checking the vehicles for expired inspection

8

stickers or registration and license plate violations.

9

They were not checking the drivers for

10

outstanding warrants.

12

the narcotics detail with them.

13

They were

They did not have any members of

It happened to be Officer Maples who stopped

14

respondent’s vehicle when he came through this

15

checkpoint.

16

exhibit a driver’s license, the respondent reached in

17

his right front pants pocket, fumbled around in that

18

pocket long enough to alarm the officer, and caused him

19

to shine his flashlight into the car, this incident

20

having occurred around 11i00 to 11i15 at night, and when

21

the respondent withdrew his hand from that pants pocket,

22

the officer could see him holding two items.

23

his thumb and index finger he was holding a folded

24

dollar bill, but between his two middle fingers where

25

I’ve placed this box, he was holding a small, green,

When Officer Maples asked the respondent to

Between

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

knotted, opaque, tied-off balloon.

The officer

2

described it as being tied about a half inch from the

3

end, and when mashed down it was approximately one-eight

4

of an inch thick.
The officer then saw the respondent drop this

5

6

balloon alongside his leg onto the car seat.

The

7

respondent reached over and opened the glove box of the

8

vehicle, presumably still trying to find the driver’s

9

license.

The light in that box came on, and inside

10

there the officer could see several items.

11

he described as a lot of loose white powder, a bag of

12

balloons apparently just as they had come from the

13

store, several small, empty plastic vials.

14

He saw what

The officer, having been experienced in this

15

sort of thing, formed the conclusion that there was some

16

sort of narcotic substance in that green balloon he had

17

first seen, so he asked the respondent to step from the

18

car and move to the rear of the vehicle, which

19

respondent did closing the door behind him.

20

The officer could then see inside the vehicle

21

still, saw the green balloon on the car seat where the

22

respondent dropped it, and he reached in and picked up

23

the balloon, noticing at that time that it contained

24

some sort of powdery substance inside.

25

The record also shows that this officer was a

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

five-year veteran of the police department.

He had

2

taken part in several arrests where such balloons had

3

been seized and found to contain narcotics.

4

one such arrest himself in the previous year in which

5

eight or nine such balloons had been recovered.

6

talked with his fellow officers about the fact that

7

narcotics were often packaged this way.

8

with drug users about the use of milk sugar, which is

9

apparently what this loose powder was.

He had made

He had

He had talked

He knew from his

10

experience what those empty plastic vials could have

11

been put to.
And it was based on this, the circumstances of

12
13

seeing this balloon and his experience with the

14

narcotics trade, that caused him to believe the balloon

15

contained narcotics, caused him to seize it, and caused

16

him then to place respondent under arrrest for

17

possession of a controlled substance.
QUESTION;

18
19

Now, what did you say was observed

in the glove compartment?
HR. MARSHALL;

20

Three classes of items, Your

21

Honor.

Several empty plastic vials — I’m not sure if

22

that’s pill bottles or test tube type of vials — a bag

23

of balloons, apparently a bag just as they had come from

24

the store — these balloons were empty — and he also

25

saw the balloons, empty plastic vials and loose white

powder
Now, at that time in the record the officer

2
3

didn’t further describe this powder, but after the

4

arrest he conducted an inventory of the vehicle, found a

5

bottle of milk sugar in the back seat, and given the

6

record, it appears that milk sugar was also what this

7

loose white powder was.

8

record that this additional powder was itself a

9

controlled substance.

10

QUESTION*

11

MR. MARSHALL*

12

There’s no evidence in the

Any firearms discovered?
No, Your Honor.

There was some

marijuana also found in the back seat, but no firearms.
QUESTION;

13

Hell, Mr. Marshall, could I ask

14

you, when was the decision in the Court of Criminal

15

Appeals?

16

MR. MARSHALL;

It was in the spring of 1981.

17

The panel decision was on March 31st.

18

for leave to file for rehearing, which under local

19

practice is accompanied by the motion itself.

20

denied on July 1st,

21

QUESTION;

Did you — had Bolton been

announced at that time?

23

MR. MARSHALL;

25

That was

1981.

22

24

He filed a motion

My recollection is that it may

have been announced on the very same day, on July 1st.
QUESTION;

Well, what do you make of this

statement in the — in the Court of Appeals — in the

2

Court of Appeals opinions

3

either the validity of the officer's initial stop of

4

appellant's vehicle as part of a license check nor the

5

propriety of the arrest, since appellant failed to

6

produce a driver's license."
MR. MARSHALL;

7

"We do not here question

I believe what they were

8

talking about there is what I would refer to in a moment

9

as the so-called prior lawful intrusion aspect of the

10

plain view doctrine.
QUESTION;

11
12

I know, but they say they do not --

they apparently say he was legally arrested.

13

MR. MARSHALL;

14

QUESTION*

Yes, Your Honor.

I —

Well, if he was legally — if he

15

was legally arrested at the time, what kind of a search

16

of the vehicle would have been authorized under Bolton?
MR. MARSHALL;

17
18

v. Belton, a search of the entire —

19

QUESTION;

20

MR. MARSHALL*

21

Or Belton, yes.

QUESTION*

23

MR. MARSHALL;

25

— The entire passenger

compartment.

22

24

Well, certainly under New York

Including -- including the balloons.
Yes, Your Honor, I think that's

right.
QUESTION;

Well, do we — isn't that the end

1

2

of the case if he was legally arrested?
SR. MARSHALL:

Well, I believe the facts

3

didn't develop that way, at least the way the testimony

4

was developed.

5
6
7

QUESTION:

Well, the case comes here to us

with the Texas court having said he was legally arrested.
HR. MARSHALL:

Well, what I'm trying to say is

8

that the officer's testimony was — and, of course,

9

there is always that dispute about when the formal

10

arrest occurred — was that he did not place the

11

respondent under arrest.

12

QUESTION:

You don't have to find facts.

13

Court of Appeals found the facts.

14

HR. MARSHALL;

I realize that.

The

I'm gust

15

saying that I — as I understood what they were saying

16

is that — and from the record -- the arrest was not

17

thought to have occurred until after the balloon had

18

been seized.

19

QUESTION:

Well, then, I suppose — how would

20

you explain their setting aside the conviction if they

21

had found he was legally arrested?

22

QUESTION:

Because they thought at that time

23

that the search of the balloon was invalid, even if he

24

was legally arrested.

25

MR. MARSHALL;

Well, another thing, if I could

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

clarify this, this respondent has —
QUESTION:

2
3
4

Because Belton came down on the

same day.
NR. MARSHALL:

— This respondent has never

5

raised, nor did the Court of Criminal Appeals address

6

the actual search inside the balloon but merely the

7

seizure of it, which I believe took place when the

8

officer reached inside the car and when he determined

9

that there was some powder in the balloon.

According to

10

the officer's testimony, the arrest only occurred I

11

suppose seconds later when he now had decided, the

12

officer had decided this must contain some sort of

13

narcotics in it, and told the respondent he was under

14

arrest for possession of a controlled substance.

15

QUESTION:

I wonder — excuse me.

16

QUESTION:

Were there two different arrests or

17

an arrest for two different offenses, one a traffic

18

offense and the other for the drug offense?

19

MR. MARSHALL:

The officer did testify that he

20

issued a ticket for no operator's license, the

21

respondent never having produced one.

22

developed in the record whether he considered that to be

23

the basis of a custodial arrest.

24
25

QUESTION:

And it wasn't

That wouldn't —

Is there any doubt as to which

arrest the Texas Court of Appeals was talking about in

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

its opinion when it says we don't doubt the validity of

2

the arrrest?

Are they talking about the drug arrest?

3

QUESTION;

4

MR. MARSHALL;

5

Well, they’re saying -That is certainly what I

thought. Your Honor.
QUESTION;

6

They refer — they refer to the

7

fact that we do not question the propriety of the arrest

8

since appellant failed to produce a driver's license.
QUESTION;

9
10

That sounds like it's a traffic

arrest.
MR. MARSHALL;

11

Well, as I say, I know they

12

said that, and I think they also were saying when they

13

don't question the stop that they were assuming under

14

Delaware v. Prouse, the initial stop of the vehicle was

15

proper.

16

The case was litigated by the defense at the

17

trial court level on whether the seizure of the balloon

18

was valid under the plain view doctrine.

19
20
21

QUESTION;

Is failure to produce a driver's

license ever an occasion for a custodial arrest?
MR. MARSHALL;

Under our state law it would be

22

possible to make a custodial arrest for that.

23

think it would normally be the practice by any means,

24

but it certainly would be possible.

25

QUESTION;

Okay.

I don't

Thank you.

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

HR. MARSHALL;

2

QUESTION!

Yes

Now, you referred to the panel

3

having considered it and then another step in there.

4

Was Belton called to the attention of the court at the

5

time reconsideration or rehearing was sought?

6

MR. MARSHALL;

No, Your Honor, it wouldn't

7

have been, because as I said, my recollection is Belton

8

was decided either on the,same day or one day after the

9

Court of Criminal Appeals --

10

QUESTION;

Yes, but I thought you said there

11

was some effort after that to get reconsideration by the

12

Court of Appeals.

13

MR. MARSHALL:

Yes, Your Honor.

I filed a

14

state's motion for rehearing, but at the time I filed

15

that Belton had not been decided.

16

QUESTION;

I see.

17

MR. MARSHALL;

When they declined to hear the

18

case, under state procedures we had no ability to make a

19

second motion for rehearing.

20

Court of Criminal Appeals decided this under the plain

21

view doctrine.

22

wanted to make later is that given a slightly different

23

timing, a slightly different approach by the Court of

24

Criminal Appeals, perhaps this seizure could have been

25

justified under Belton, even under Ross, or perhaps

And again, as I say, the

And in fact, one of the points I had

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

under South Dakota v. Opperman as an inventory of the

2

vehicle, which probably was going to have taken place.
We think that underscores the anomalous nature

3
4

of this decision and shows what a disadvantage law

5

enforcement officers are put to in the State of Texas

6

because of the view of the plain view doctrine

7

established by the Court of Criminal Appeals.
QUESTION*

8
9

Ordinarily isn't an inventory

process something that occurs after the vehicle and the

10

person have been taken to the police headquarters?

11

don't make inventory — inventories out on the street,

12

do you?

13

MR. MARSHALL*

You

There is some testimony about

14

this in our record indicating that Fort Worth officers

15

make an initial quick inventory and fill out what they

16

called a record sheet.

17
18

QUESTION*

Well, that's after — that's after

you've got some business to do it.

19

MR. MARSHALL*

20

QUESTION:

21

Yes.

Like having made an arrest, which

requires probable cause.

22

MR. MARSHALL:

23

QUESTION*

Yes.

Mr. Attorney General, if I can go

24

back a little, do I understand your position to be that

25

this man was stopped and the officer asked him for a

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

license, and he reached in his pocket and said I don’t

2

have a license but I've got an illegal drug and a dollar

3

bill?

4

MR. MARSHALL;

5

his pocket, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

6
7

And I suppose —

I just wanted to be sure I

understood you.
MR. MARSHALL;

8
9

That is what he brought out of

I suppose it’s an equal

inference from the record whether he was trying to get

10

the balloon out of his pocket because he was afraid the

11

officer might come across it, or if it was just sheer

12

bad luck on his part that it became wedged in his hand

13

when he may have legitimately been looking for a

14

license.

15

license, and the balloon just accidentally on his part

16

became wedged between his fingers.

17
18

Perhaps he thought this dollar bill was his

QUESTION;

You mean he was going to bribe the

officer with a dollar?

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. MARSHALL;

No, Your Honor.

I’m saying I

21

think perhaps since it was described as a folded dollar

22

bill, he might have felt that in his pocket and thought

23

that was a driver’s license he was about to drag out of

24

his pocket and not a folded dollar bill.

25

QUESTION;

Well, according to you he never did

15

1

have a driver's license.
MR. MARSHALL*

2
3

produced one.
QUESTION*

4
5

No, Your Honor, he never

So he wasn't reaching for a

driver's license.
MR. MARSHALL*

6

Assuming he was consciously

7

aware that he didn't have one, I think that would be

8

true.

9

I don't know.
QUESTION*

I would think people are

10

consciously aware of what they have and what they don't

11

have in their pockets.

12
13
14

MR. MARSHALL*

Well, I would think most of the

time, but I can't read the mind of this respondent.
QUESTION*

May I ask you a question about your

15

theory of the plain view doctrine?

16

away from the automobile because it raises Belton and

17

all these other questions.

18

airport, and the man had been asked to show his ticket.

19

He reached in his pocket, and he pulled out by -- say

20

inadvertently a balloon just like this and he at the

21

same time had his luggage going through the detector,

22

and they say exactly what they saw here.

23

your view that they could just seize the balloon?

24

MR. MARSHALL*

25

QUESTION*

Let's take the case

Say this happened in an

It would be

Yes, Your Honor, that's right.

And is that because the person

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

seeing the balloon has probable cause to believe its

2

contents are contraband?
MR. MARSHALL*

3
4

Yes, Your Honor.

The issue we

see in this case gives this —
QUESTION;

5

All right.

Let me take you one

6

step further.

Say they saw all that, and then he put it

7

back in the suitcase and then carried it down the way

8

toward the plane.

9

— you have probable cause to believe within the

You now know that within the suitcase

10

suitcase there’s this contraband.

11

power to seize the suitcase and open it because it's in

12

plain view.
MR. MARSHALL*

13

Would you have the

Your Honor, I think they would

14

have the power to seize the suitcase.

15

that this phrase in Coolidge v. New Hampshire about the

16

contraband nature of the item being immediately apparent

17

means probable cause.

18

they could seize the suitcase.
QUESTION*

19
20

And so in your example I think

Well, here did they also open the

balloon ?
MR. MARSHALL*

21

22

At some point they certainly

did analyze —

23

QUESTION*

24

MR. MARSHALL*

25

Our position is

Without a warrant.
Yes, Your Honor, as far as I

know.

QUESTIONS

1

2

Then why couldn't you open the

suitcase?

3

MR. MARSHALLs

The only reason I hesitate

4

there is because of the — this Court's so-called

5

container cases — Chadwick and Sanders.
QUESTIONS

6
7

my question.

Why isn't the balloon a container?

MR. MARSHALLs

8
9

Well, that's exactly the point of

positive.

It may be.

Your Honor, it may be.

I'm not

But again, I want to emphasize

10

the only question the respondent has ever brought up is

11

the seizure of the balloon —

12

QUESTIONS

13

MR. MARSHALLs

I understand.
— Not the opening of it.

14

That's — it's a very narrow case in that sense.

15

never brought that issue up.

3

We

I don't think there's any issue here on the

4

so-called prior intrusion or the inadvertent discovery.

5

And the only clarification and correction there we seek

6

is that "immediately apparent" means "probable cause."

7

We think that is supported by many of this Court's

3

cases, although obviously never exactly answered.

9

Warden v. Hayden speaks in terms of probable

10

cause to seize an item.

Colorado v. Bannister, a pro

11

curiam opinion only one term ago, talked about seizing

12

items in an automobile because the officer when he saw

13

these lug nuts and wrenches in the car recognized them

14

as meeting the description of property that was stolen

15

and which he had just received a broadcast about.

16

Court said because he had probable cause to seize them,

17

he could do so without a warrant.

18

exactly the situation here.

proper as incident to the arrest?

Like what?

MR. MARSHALL*

Well, in this case the unusual

3

nature in which this balloon was brought out of his

4

pocket and, in our view, discreetly or surreptitiously

5

dropped along his pants leg onto the car set; the

6

distinctive knotted nature of this balloon which the

7

officer said he associated with narcotics; and then what

8

we think are obvious narcotics packaging items in the

9

glove box — the milk, sugar, the powder, the plastic

10

vials, the bag of balloons.
And we think, as Chief Justice Burger's

11
12

opinion in U.S. v. Cortez made clear, probable cause to

13

detain, to seize has to be evaluated based on all the

14

circumstances which the officer sees, and including the

15

experience he has and the inferences he can draw based

16

on that.
QUESTION;

18

Well, I don’t -- the experience he

has in balloons?
MR. MARSHALL*

19

Well, that is one thing, Your

The record is replete with testimony of what he

associated with balloons, and yet the Court of Criminal

5

The defense has conceded that probable cause

Yes.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Courts
There are two aspects to the respondent's
position that we'd like to review.

The first is the one

10

that Mr. Marshall just left off on, and that is it is

11

repsectfully suggested that this case is not ripe and

12

should be sent back to the Texas Court of Criminal

13

Appeals for clarification as to exactly what was the

14

basis of their decision.

15

Section 9 of the Texas constitution, or was it in fact

16

the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution?

17

Secondly,

Has it in fact Article I,

the respondent would state that if

18

the Court does reach the search issue, an analysis of

19

the case shows it to be consistent with the federal

20

rules in the cases dealing with the plain view seizures.

21

Looking at the first issue, that is, the

22

independent state grounds, respondent would say that

23

this is not a Fourth Amendment case.

24

to note that in the opinion of the court below the only

25

mention of the Fourth Amendment is where the court

In the case of

The analysis of the Texas Court of Criminal

Appeals was that under this Court’s ruling, the Fifth

20

Amendment privilege did not extend to the blood test.

Further, under Schmurber v. California, the defendant,

22

given those circumstances, there was no Fourth Amendment

Are you aware of Crowell v. State,

8

a Texas Criminal Court of Appeals case which stated that

9

Article I, Section 9 of the constitution of Texas and

10

the Fourth Amendment to the federal Constitution are in

11

all material respects the same?

12

MR. BUTCHER:

13

No, ma’am, I’m not familiar with

that.
It’s interesting that at least one judge of

14
15

the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals does now share that

16

view, though.

17

1982, just last year, granted it’s a dissenting opinion

18

in Synder v. the State, Judge Tiegg, Marvin Tiegg, wrote

19

that he felt that Texas and the Texas constitution

20

affords individuals more protection than does the Fourth

21

Amendment.

In an opinion that was handed down in

22

23

colleagues, though.

direct quote — "This construction is in keeping with

2

the traditions of individuality, privacy and personal

3

liberty which have marked the history of our state.”

4

So at least one justice — judge is thinking

5

along those lines.

6

recently retired, has noted several times in opinions

7

the use of Article I, Section 9, but he has never

8

suggested that it's a different standard or really

expounded on it as Justice Tiegg or Judge Tiegg did.

Well, it's certainly not clear,

3

as to what is the basis.

the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

5

It could just as easily have been Article I, Section 9,

because the citing of Coolidge can be viewed as merely a

7

jumping off point.

8

that states can develop their own standards for searches

9

and seizures so long as they don’t fall below the

It could have been Article —

In other words, it's well recognized

minimum standards provided by the Fourth Amendment.
Those minimum standards, it might be imagined,

12

are set out in Coolidge, and using Coolidge as a

13

starting place, they then build a Texas standard, and

HR. BUTCHERi

6

QUESTION*

7

Well, I —

Why isn’t the balloon just like the

tinfoil package?
HR. BUTCHER*

9

How is that essentially

said that.

It would be if the officer had

In other words, the officer doesn’t clearly

10

state that he knows that heroin is kept in balloons or

11

that any controlled substance is kept in balloons.

12

says that he made an arrest the year before involving a

13

balloon and heroin —

14

QUESTION*

He

Well, then, what did he mean —

15

I’ll read that question to you again.

Question*

"So he

16

was arrested on the suspicion that the green balloon

17

that you found contained a controlled substance, some

18

type of controlled substance?"

"Yes, sir."

19

How could he say it more plainly than that?

20

MR. BUTCHERi

But he didn't give any rational

21

basis for why he believed there was a controlled

22

substance in there.

23

QUESTION*

Well, let me ask you this.

Suppose

24

at — suppose at the suppression hearing the officer

25

testified exactly like this, and the judge said well, I

51

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

don't think you've really spelled out this — why you

2

thought that was — so the prosecutor says well. I'll

3

call an experienced officer and have him testify.

4

the officer says a hundred thousand times he's — he

5

gives all the explanation anyone could possibly give

6

which would indicate that at the time in fact there was

7

probable cause to seize the balloon.
Now, would you say that it would violate the

8

9
10

And

Fourth Amendment for that also to have seized it without
being able to testify to anything?
MR. BUTCHER*

11

Well, I recognize I'm going

12

counter to the — to the — to the opinions, but it

13

would seem to me that the officer — the officer making

14

the stop, he's the one who has to recognize that he's

15

got probable cause in front of him.

16

new information and so forth I don't think ought to

17

reach back to justify the seizure.

18

the time of the incident —

Do you — do you — do you have —

do you have cases to that effect?

MR. BUTCHER*

QUESTION;

23

After the fact or

No, sir.

You’ve got cases on the other side,

don't you?

Yes.

In this Court.

MR. BUTCHER;

2

QUESTION;

Yes

How does the Texas court treat that

3

problem?

4

the officer himself had knowledge?

5

don't require it, but maybe as a matter of Texas law

6

they do.

I mean maybe we

Or you're not arguing that?
MR. BUTCHER:

Do they consider it significant as to whether

I don't know.

I don't know of

any Texas cases on that point.
QUESTION:

9

You don't think it was enough in
«

10

this case that the fellow who examined the — who did

11

the forensic examination, he said how many drug analyses

12

have you done?

13

it's common or uncommon to discover that there's

14

controlled substances quite frequently housed or

15

contained in balloons such as this?"

It’s a close call.

Let me ask you another question

8

about your Texas procedure.

9

to the negative case and the brown bottle case, I guess

10

it was.

The opinion ends referring

Were those — those are both Texas cases.

11

MS. BUTCHER:

12

QUESTIONS

Yes.

Were they decided — do you know

13

whether they were decided on Fourth Amendment or Texas

14

grounds?
MR. BUTCHER:

15

It’s not clear.

They cite

16

Coolidge as a jumping off point, but -- and that's the

17

thing, I think, that needs to be kept in mind.

18

started — Coolidge is 1971, as I recall.

19

application of it in Texas was Nicholas, and that’s a

20

1973 case, and that is the photographic negative case.

21

Then it expands to 1977 with the Duncan case which is

22

the bottle, the brown bottle, et cetera.

Coolidge

The first

And you don’t find any other federal cases

23
24

cited.

You will always find Coolidge, then Nicholas,

25

then Duncan, then Howard, now Brown.

54
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

I think this is a narrow holding, and it

2

really carries forward a line of cases that I just

3

recited, and just applies the holdings of those cases —

4

Duncan, Howard, et al., to a specialized set of

5

circumstances; that is, green balloons in this case.
There is a red balloon case, DeLoa v. the

6
7

State, a 1977 one, where again the officer making an

8

arrest found a red balloon on the window sill.

9

seized it.

It was in fact heroin.

He

That was ruled

10

inadmissible, again because the officer failed to

11

articulate a rational basis for his arriving at the

12

conclusion that he had evidence of a crime before him.

13

So this is not the first balloon case.

14

is the second balloon case.

15

and then one now.

16

QUESTIONS

This

You've got a red one in

This isn’t also a case.

'77

You said

17

there weren’t any cases that were decided on the ground

18

that the officer was unable to articulate the reasons

19

for the arrest.

20

Now you're saying that’s such a case.

MB. BUTCHEBs

Oh, no.

No.

I’m sorry.

I did

21

not communicate effectively.

22

fact, all of those -- Duncan, Howard, DeLoa, and

23

Nicholas are all examples -- well, Nicholas would not,

24

but the others are examples.

25

QUESTION;

There are cases — in

For example, seeing the --

Examples of what?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

MR. BUTCHER;

Examples of incidents where you

2

had an innocent item there that did in fact contain a

3

controlled substance, but the officer was unable to

4

articulate a rational basis for arriving at the

5

conclusion that he had —

6

QUESTION;

Hell, then, is it — are you

7

arguing — I sometimes have difficulty being sure what

8

you're arguing — but are you arguing that there is a

9

set of Texas cases that sets aside searches on the

10

ground that even if there might have been in an

11

objective sense probable cause, it was nevertheless bad

12

because the officer could not testify to facts that

13

prompted him to do -- to make the seizure?

14

MB. BUTCHERS

15

QUESTION*

16
17

Yes.

Now, again —

Now, that may be a different rule

than we apply.
QUESTION;

Well, those three cases you say,

18

though, didn't say — didn't say that objectively there

19

might have been probable cause, but the officer just

20

didn't articulate it.

21

MR. BUTCHER;

22

Thank you.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

24

Do you have anything further, Mr. Marshall?

25

That's correct.

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. CHRIS MARSHALL, ESQ.,

56

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

OS BEHALF OF THE PETITIONEE

1

MR. MARSHALL*

2
3

REBUTTAL

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, if I

have time to make just a couple of points.
First, I think respondent is attributing to

4
5

the state court a finding it didn’t make; that is,

6

something about articulating the basis for probable

7

cause.

8

is cited in Judge McCormick’s dissent below, will make

9

clear that Texas has always looked to the objective

My recollection is that Simpson v. State, which

10

facts, not to the officer’s subjective state of mind to

11

look to probable cause.

12

I’d also say that I believe it’s true, as

13

Justice White says, that this case could be decided in

14

the State’s favor without mentioning the plain view

15

doctrine, because cases such as Chadwick, Sanders, and

16

G.M. Leasing seem to indicate that the mere seizure of

17

an item can be based on probable cause as opposed to

18

what might need to be shown for the search of it.

19

20
21

QUESTION;

Well, you can arrest a person on

probable cause.
MR. MARSHALL;

Certainly.

Under U.S. v.

22

Watson, you can arrest on probable cause.

However, this

23

could be seen as a plain view case in the sense that the

24

officer did view these items in the car without having

25

to make any search, any rummaging of the car; and to

57

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that extent it can be seen as a plain view case, though

2

again as Justice Stevens suggests, that could be said of

3

most — said to be true of most any plain view case.

4

The point we want to make is that we don't

5

believe tha plain view doctrine, which is what the Texas

6

court relied on, should be a restriction on the state's

7

activities, on the police officer's authority.

8

believe that probable cause is a standard, and that's

9

what should have been applied here.
QUESTIONS

10

We

Mr. Marshall, as a general

11

proposition do you take the view that the Texas Article

12

I, Section 9 protection is co-extensive with the Fourth

13

Amendment?

14

Schmurber problem, where it seemed to be different.

15

He cited just one case, I think, the

ME. MARSHALLs

I was going to say something

16

about that.

I believe, although I don't have the case

17

with me because it hadn't been cited before, that

18

shephardizing Escamillia would show that it has now been

19

overruled because of a recent amendment to the Texas

20

search warrant statute in Chapter 18 of our Code of

21

Criminal Procedure.

22

based not on state constitutional law, but on the

23

specific search warrant statute we had.

24

general our Article I, Section 9 is co-extensive with

25

the Fourth Amendment.

And I think that decision there was

I know Article I, Section 10 has

Shorthaus just published at 640 Southwest Second 924.

4

And I am not aware of any case where under state

constitutional law we have found any special state law

plain view doctrine or any state law unusual or peculiar

notion of probable cause.
And again on this state law ground question, I

think it is very clear that every state case the Court
