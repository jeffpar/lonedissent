ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
This case comes from the state of South
Dakota, and it was on a writ of certiorari granted in

10

May of this year to review a case involving the refusal

11

by an individual in the state of South Dakota to submit

12

to a blood test.

13

to this issue, and I will go through them quickly.

14

The facts are very brief but important

About 9 o’clock in the evening of the 19th of

15

July, 1980, the defendant was stopped by law enforcement

16

officers in the city of Madison, South Dakota.

17

stopped for the reason that he failed to stop at a stop

18

sign, and when he was pulled over, he was asked two

19

questions: number one, to get out of the car, and number

20

two, for his driver’s license.

21

He was

As he got out of the automobile, he staggered,

22

fell against the car to, at least in the opinion of the

23

officer, get his balance.

24

the odor of alcohol.

25

license, he said: I’m not going to lie to you, I don't

He also smelled of alcohol,

When asked for his driver's

which is

After he failed a series of sobriety tests, he

4

was taken down to the station.

He was advised of his

5

Miranda warnings and he was advised of the South Dakota

6

implied consent statute and asked if he would take a

7

blood test, and he refused.

8

consent statute a second time, he refused a second time,

9

and on the third occasion, he again was read the implied

consent statute and he refused.

11

sta tion .

12

That was at the police

The defendant made a motion to suppress his

13

statements, his refusal to take this blood test, and the

14

trial court did suppress the refusal and any related

15

evidence, basically on three grounds: number one, that

16

the statute of South Dakota was unconstitutional; number

17

two, that it was not relevant evidence; and number

18

three, that Mr. Neville had not been advised that if he

19

refused to take the test, that fact of refusal would be

20

used against him.

21

And I will point out to the Court that this

22

law changed in South Dakota.

It was passed, became

23

effective July 1, 1980.

24

days after the passage of that statute.

25

statute in part reads: “If a person refuses to submit to

This occurrence was some 19

chemical analysis of his blood, urine, breath or other

2

bodily substance as provided in other subsections, such

3

refusal may be admissible into evidence at the trial."

4

This Court granted the state's reguest to look

5

at this issue, whether this statute that I have just

6

read to you — which allows the fact of the refusal to

7

take a test to determine blood alcohol content of a

8

motorist to be admitted into evidence at the subsequent

9

trial of the motorist for driving while under the

10

influence of alcohol — violates the Fifth Amendment

11

privilege against self-incrimination .

12

QUESTION:

Eut the statute doesn’t require

13

that he be informed specifically that it may be admitted

14

in evidence.

15

MR. MEIERHENRY:

16

QUESTION;

17

MR. MEIERHENRY*

18

QUESTION:

No, it does not.

As the New York statute does.
No, it does not.

Does it require that he be advised

19

that it could be used with respect to the revocation or

20

reissuance of his driver's license?

21

MR. MEIERKENRYs

Yes.

If you look in the

22

appendix on page 9, there is a card that is given to

23

each police officer that is a part of the statute and

24

explains their rights.

25

not take the test they may lose their license for up to

It does inform them if they do

a year
QUESTION!

2

Why do you think, the legislature

3

drew a distinction between the two?

4

SB . MEIERHENRY:

Perhaps.

Oversight?
I guess I would

5

point out that the reason this individual was not

6

advised of the fact that his refusal could be used

7

against him is explained by the police officer in the

8

appendix, which is the cards from Pierre, which is the

9

state capitol and where these things are mailed out of,

10

had not updated the new card.

11

now that each individual, if this is found

12

constitutional, and are, in fact, being advised that the

13

refusal could be used against them.

14

the case, because of this 19 days, the bureaucracy did

15

not set into operation quick enough, is the only reason

16

that this individual was not so advised.
QUESTION:

17

I might inform the Court

So that portion of

But Mr. Attorney General, does that

18

mean that the failure to give him this advice would make

19

the evidence inadmissible no matter how we ruled?
MR. MEIERHENRY!

20

No, I don't believe it would,

21

and it would be our position that it would not make it

22

so inadmissible.

23

court would consider, but I don't believe it does.
QUESTION;

24
25

It might be something that the state

But the trial judge ruled it would,

didn't he?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. MEIERHENRY;

Yes, but that issue has been

2

remanded back to the trial court.

3

the South Dakota Supreme Court decided was that the

4

statute itself was unconstitutional because it violated

5

the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

6

QUESTION;

The only thing that

Well, what will happen if the trial

7

judge on the remand says, well, maybe the statute is

8

constitutional, but the evidence is still inadmissible

9

because of this reason?

10
11

Then would you have another

appeal to the South Dakota Supreme Court?
MR. MEIERHENRY;

No, I think not because that

12

goes more to the matter of — he also ruled as to

13

relevancy, which could change from judge to judge.

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. MEIERHENRY;

16
17
18
19

Right.
But this Court can decide the

issue of whether it violates the Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION;

But that won't determine whether it

is admissible or not.
MR. MEIERHENRY;

It will under South Dakota

20

law because I think these other matters will fall into

21

place after that, if it is admissible and not in

22

violation of the Fifth Amendment.

23

QUESTION;

No, but I mean it is still

24

conceivable, at least, that the trial judge will say

25

this evidence is inadmissible for two reasons that the

7

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

United States has no business telling me how to decide*

2

one, that it is not relevant, and two, you didn’t give

3

the advice you are supposed to give under the statute.
MR. MEIERHENRY:

4

I think the relevancy issue,

5

first of all, can be decided because the legislature, in

6

the first place, said it's relevant.

7

motion to suppress, I might point out.

8

QUESTION*

9

MR. MEIERHENRY*

This was on a

Right.
There has been no trial.

10

Number one, our legislature has said in the statute it

11

is relevant, so I think that issue is a matter of

12

evidentiary law in our state; the trial judge was just

13

erroneous, he is wrong on that issue.

14

had that issue bean covered or approached by our South

15

Dakota Supreme Court, the trial judge may have been

16

overruled on that point, and I would have to say to the

17

Court we are speculating at that point.

18

point I think it is clearly relevant, mainly because the

19

legislature says it is, plus some evidentiary reasons.
QUESTION*

20

And I think that

But on that

May I ask one other question on the

21

procedure.

22

question with the admissibility of his statement — I'm

23

too drunk to take the test -- or he said something like

24

that, as I understand.

25

They also sent back, as I remember it, the

MR. MEIERHENRY*

Yes.

And the trial judge ntay well rule

2

one way or the other on that issue.

3

that that statement is inadmissible.

4

to ask for review of that in the state Supreme Court?

5

SR. MEIERHENRYi

6

QUESTION*

7

Would you be able

I guess -- yes.

It seems to me much more probative

than the test itself.
SR. MEIERHENRY*

3ay he says again

we could.

The answer, quickly, is yes,

What the state wants is the results of the

10

test.

11

has not, again, been reached by the South Dakota Supreme

12

Court.

13

Not before this Court are the statements.

That

But —
QUESTION*

But is it not possible -- the

14

reason I ask these questions is I want to be sure we

15

have a final judgment here.

16

a second appeal on that issue to the state Supreme

17

Court, they might decide that the evidence is

18

inadmissible for one of the other two reasons, relevance

19

or failure to give advice?

20

have something we must decide here.

21

NR. MEIERHENRY*

Is it not possible that on

I just wonder if we know we

Well, I think you must decide

22

it because, if you will look at the lower court, the

23

South Dakota Supreme Court case in a footnote, they are

24

obviously qoing to follow this Court in the sense that

25

as arbitrator of the Fifth Amendment, plus I don't

1

believe they ever considered the relevancy issue.

2

they did, they would have to rule, and they did, that

3

this statute is unconstitutional on the basis of

4

relevancy, and I don’t see how relevancy -QUESTION;

5

If

No, no, no, I understand that.

Eut

6

they did also say that it was unconstitutional under

7

your state’s constitution as well as the federal, too,

8

as I remember.
NR. MEIERHENRY:

9

That’s correct.

But I

10

believe if you will look at a footnote, I believe it is

11

footnote -- not the famous footnote 9 in Schmerber, but

12

I think it is also footnote 9 in the Northwestern

13

citation, that they have in effect indicated that the

14

Fifth Amendment, as pointed out by this Court, although

15

our amendment to our state constitution has a little

16

different wording, that they would take the same

17

interpretation and it is not more expansive than found

18

here.
QUESTION;

19

Well, if this evidence is

20

inadmissible under the Fifth Amendment and the case goes

21

back on that basis and there is an acquittal, you are

22

through.

23
24
25

NR. MEIERHENRY;

That is correct.

If this

Court should hold that the fact of refusal —
QUESTION;

Well, if we said there wasn’t a

1

final judgment and didn’t review the case, then the

2

evidence is inadmissible and you could never get review

3

if there is an acquittal.

4

MR. MEIERHENRYs

5

That’s true.

And in most

regards these —
QUESTIONS

6

Well, it isn't quite true because

7

there could be another appeal.

8

question of whether "I'm too drunk to testify," that

9

issue, you will be back in the South Dakota Supreme

10

Court again where it might bring up all these issues.
QUESTIONS

12

If you appeal on the

That is a

state issue.

13

QUESTIONS

Well, that is this case.

14

MR. MEIERHENRY;

I guess we can't go forward

15

in state court unless the Fifth Amendment -- the primary

16

issue is the Fifth Amendment, and as this Court knows,

17

we have two appellate circuits of the federal system,

18

states on either side of the issue.

talks about the refusal, we feel, is within the Fifth

20

Amendment.

22

individual is arrested and taken into custody, it begins

to disappear, it’s evidence that will disappear --

MR. MEIERHENRY:

Well, I think the test —

Isn't that enough to convince any

jury that he is drunk?

We are not submitting at this

point that we could get his comments in.

9

I know that, but I'm just saying

10

factually then you wouldn't have had all this trouble,

11

would you?
MR. MEIERHENRY:

12

No, but we believe that our

13

South Dakota Legislature in passing this statute that

14

allows the fact of refusal to be put into evidence had a

15

number of things in mindi first of all, to remove, or to

16

rather allow the jury to know all the facts, number one.

Like killing a gnat with a sledge

MR. MEIERHENRY:

19

Well, I think it's important

these matters, that we take certain things into

So it is something

I doubt if you can take 12 citizens in the

refer to the federal system, and it is part of the

would a federal district judge do when he reads and

2

finds out that, number one, handwriting samples are

3

admissible,

4

pleading evidence, a handwriting sample, obviously -- he

5

orders the defendant to give the court or the

6

prosecution a sample of his handwriting and he fails to

7

do so.

10

and so he issues an order — and this is not

QUESTION:

He can be compelled in an open

court, can he not?
HR. MEIERHENRY:

He can. Your Honor, and U.S.

Court denied cert.

13

is what happens to that right of refusal.

14

suggested pattern federal jury instructions, out of

15

Divett and Blackmar, and I’m paraphrasing a little bit,

16

but here is what the judge would tell the jury in a

17

federal case: There is evidence that the defendant after

18

his arrest refused to furnish a sample of his

19

handwriting.

20

of the defendant’s privilege against

you think it is entitled to as tending to prove

consciousness of guilt.

Well, what is even more interesting

That is what would happen in the federal

system, not a violation of the Fifth Amendment, the

3

handwriting, and an inference of guilt or at least

4

tending to prove consciousness of guilt.

and Blackmar is not the Supreme Court, obviously, but it

is the suggested pattern jury instructions that we all

use and has not been found by any court to be improper.

Now, Divett

So here South Dakota tried to fashion a
remedy, and all the Court is aware of the reason for

10

these implied consent laws, and we are another state,

don *t want to hold our citizens down and forcefully take

12

this blood sample.

13

South Dakota.

14

We don't want that in the state of

But we have made some conditions.

One of the

15

conditions not discussed here is that if you refuse to

16

take your blood test, you lose your license for one

year. That is also common.

18

hooker in South Dakota, and it is if you don't take the

19

test, you automatically lose your license for a year,

20

but if you plead guilty before the separate hearing on

21

the refusal, the civil hearing on the refusal, then we

22

won't take your driver's license away. So in a way, even

23

though you refuse, if you plead guilty, admit your

24

guilt, which is some kind of compulsion, you aren't

25

going to lose your license for a year.

But we have got another

Obviously, that

QUESTION

4

Doesn't anyone argue that that

burdens your federal right to a jury trial?
MR. MEIERHENRYj

5

No, because I think only

6

those defendants — we have discussed that before.

7

Probably the only time we would see it is on the third

8

offense.

9

opportunity on his second offense to do so, he may go in

It is a felony.

If an individual took an

10

and attack in the federal system his plea on the second

11

offense, trying to throw that out so it isn't a felony,

12

because the third offense is a felony.

13

reason I could ever see you would see it in the federal

14

courts, is an attempt to play the system against itself

15

and say "I was compelled."

That is the only

16

3o if you look at the handwriting sample,

17

which some of the justices of this Court in various

18

decisions have said is a real physical evidence, if you

19

can compel in the federal system someone to take a

20

handwriting sample, you can compel them to take a blood

21

test.

22

QUESTIONi

It's easier, I suppose, to compel a

23

breathalyzer test or a blood test than it is a

24

handwriting test because you can't tie a man down and

25

force him to give a handwriting example, can you, but

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

you can tie him down and take a blood test or a

2

breathalyzer test.
MR. MEIERHENRY;

3

Your Honor, I think there are

4

some other things that are involved, too.

Handwriting

5

is hand writing, and in the Askew case it took 19 months

6

for the federal judge to get a sample.

7

to write left-handed in the meantime or something.

8

I think the fact is it is pleading evidence and it is

9

scientifically acceptable.

Maybe he learned
But

10

We know when we talk about a 1.5 blood count

11

in courts, and the jury, perhaps, knows what the issue

12

is, what we are talking about.

13

evidence there is.

14

much as it helps the state in determining what is his

15

blood count.

16

who is experienced in this area, would have come out

17

with a .05, he probably would have never faced the

18

charges.

20

testimony; staggering, slurred speech.

It is probably the best

And

Those of us that have defended and prosecuted

5

6

these cases, you must realize -- just as was pointed out

7

in this Court when you approved the instruction of

8

possession of recently stolen property -- there are

9

certain things in life that this Court can recognize and

know goes into criminal cases or into the affairs of

And the state, if it puts in its refusal, it

settles the issue.

There is no blood test because none

to push guilt onto this person.

know what the blood test is.

real and physical as handwriting or any of the other

in South Dakota you have to agree to take this blood

going to give you the power to refuse -- not the right

-- the power to refuse, and he exercises that power, we

QUESTION*

Kr. Attorney General, I know in

21

this case you are not arguing about the conversation

22

"I’m too drunk" because that has not been determined

23

yet, but it seems to me that in order to put in the fact

24

of refusal,

25

couldn’t ask for the conclusion, did he refuse.

just as a matter of evidentiary, you

19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Wouldn’t you have to ask what did the officer say to him

2

and what did he say?

3

to consider whether the conversation that took place was

4

admissible?

5

So wouldn’t you necessarily have

MR. MEIER HENRY:

I think that all of us would

6

look at this Court’s decision in this case and try to

7

determine how much of the words we can put in.

8

you would expect this type of record to come out;

9

Question;

I think

"Was he given a blood test?”

10

”No, he wasn’t.”

11

"Did you offer him one?"

12

"Yes/ I did."

"Well, why didn't he take the blood test?"

"I read him the implied consent clauses

I object on the grounds it calls

for a conclusion.
MR. MEIEFHENRYi

it, and I would say by his words and actions he

indicated he refused.

21

MR. MEIERHENRY;

22
23

And I made the objection right now.
Because it is going to be

different —
QUESTION:

It seems to me — I’m not

24

suggesting it’s right or wrong, but it does seem to me

25

just as a normal evidentiary matter, that's the way you

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

put this kind of conclusion into evidence, by putting in

2

the conversation that took place.

3

sure why you are afraid to argue that you have a right

4

to do that.

I'm really not quite

MR. MEIERHENRY:

6

do have a right to do it.

8

lower court, we feel, I guess, it would be dicta in this

9

case to do so.

10

11

I guess the state believes we

But we believe we should be able to put

those comments in.
QUESTION:

But it seems to me that you can't

12

really answer the ultimate question whether you can put

13

in the refusal unless the trial lawyer knows how he is

14

going to go about doing it.

15

MR. MEIER HENRY:

Well, we submit that first of

16

all, the evidence itself is constitutional.

17

appear that Schmerber has said it is constitutional.

18
19

20

QUESTION:

It would

What do you mean when you say

evidence is constitutional?
MR. MEIERHENRY:

We are saying that the blood,

21

were it taken from the individual over his objection,

22

could be offered at trial.

23

QUESTION:

Well, are you saying really that

24

there is nothing in the Fifth Amendment or Sixth

25

Amendment or whatever it is that would prevent it from

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

being offered at trial?
MR. MEIEEHENRY;

2

That is what we would say,

3

that the base evidence that we are seeking here, and the

4

state prefers to have rather than a refusal, is a blood

5

test.

6

witness, and the results of those tests can be testified

7

to.

8
9

We can draw the blood, we can give it to another

That is the base evidence.
QUESTION:

We can’t say that here so far as

the South Dakota courts are concerned.

All we can say

10

is that there is nothing in the Fifth Amendment that

11

prevents them from being used by the South Dakota courts,

12

MR. MEIERHENRY;

That is correct.

And I

13

believe every state jurisdiction has used the Fifth

14

Amendment to the United States Constitution, the

15

Schmerber case and so forth and made all kinds of

16

different interpretations of what the Fifth Amendment

17

says, and only this Court can do that as to the Fifth

18

Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

19

Our court has indicated that it will follow

20

the lead of the South Dakota Supreme Court on what the

21

Fifth Amendment means, obviously, and secondary, that

22

our state constitution, although they used slightly

23

different words, will follow the Fifth Amendment precept

24

under the United States Constitution.

25

QUESTION:

But are you in effect arguing that

22

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

since the court has held that it is appropriate for the

2

state to compel, to compel the extraction of blood, a

3

fortiori if the blood is admissible, the refusal to do

it is admissible?
HR. MEIERHENRY:

5

I believe it follows.

I

believe the only thing that makes this unusual is

legislatures, some legislatures have given the

8

individual the power to refuse,

9

their body invaded; but then they have also put the duty

to take the consequences, which are not in violation of

11

the Fifth Amendment.

13

Constitution of taking it by force.

taken, ani that should be brought to the fact finder. I

19

can *t imagine a state or federal judge trying one of

20

these cases not listening to why there wasn't a blood

21

test.

22

if it's irrelevant I will strike it out, as all of us

23

are familiar that court trials do.

anyone trying to find the facts of this issue would not

expect to know why there wasn't a blood tests Why hasn't

are the facts of this case as long as it doesn't violate

It goes to the

We can testify as to slurred speech, not

1

It seems very reasonable under the United

2

States Constitution that a state attempting to give its

3

citizens or any visitors the power to refuse this bodily

4

intrusion are then more limited in their evidentiary

5

presentation to a jury than if they said, we don't care,

6

we don't care, we're going to hold them down, we're

7

going to hire big officers and we’re going to find large

8

nurses and we're going to take the blood tests, and then

9

we're going to put in the evidence of how the individual

10

struggled and swore and punched someone, then we have a

11

felony, perhaps, assaulting an officer.

12

This is not reasonable.

This is not what the

13

Fifth Amendment should do when a state is attempting to

14

have, through a power that it has been issued, a

15

reasonable way in which to get evidence which is allowed

16

under the Fifth Amendment.

We would ask that this Court reverse the
judgment, and I would keep my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID R. GIENAPP, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GIENAPP;

6
7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
As the Attorney General has indicated, the

8
9

issue in this particular case presented to this Court is

10

the constitutionality of a South Dakota statute allowing

11

into evidence an individual's refusal to take a blood

12

alcohol test.

13

South Dakota statute that was in existence long before

14

this statute.

This refusal is committed pursuant to a

Since 1960 South Dakota has statutorily

15
16

allowed an individual to refuse to take a blodd alcohol

17

test, not without some certain civil penalties, but

18

allowed that permission.

19

passed by the South Dakota legislature allowing evidence

20

of that refusal into evidence at the trial for the DWI,

21

which is the South Dakota vernacular, I guess, for

22

driving while intoxicated, the formal charge in South

23

Dakota.

24
25

QUESTION;

In 1980 this statute was

Mr. Gienapp, was that

1980

amendment that you just spoke about in response to a

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

decision of the Supreme Court?
SR. GIENAPP;

2

It was perhaps a year and a half

3

later after a decision of the South Dakota Supreme Court

4

that held that such a refusal was not admissible without

5

a statute, basically.

6

the briefs, and I believe it is State v. Oswald.
QUESTIONS

7

I believe that case is cited in

Then was the South Dakota Supreme

8

Court conceding, at least sub silentio, that there was

no constitutional issue involved, if they were inviting

the legislature to pass a statute?

presently in existence was presented —

That is

Was this your interpretation of

I thought that is what you said.
MR. GIENAPP;

No, Your Honor.

My

22

interpretation is that they merely said point blank it's

23

not admissible, not referring to the constitutional

24

issue or otherwise.

25

they inferred that there was not a constitutional issue,

There was a subsequent case where

27

1

which they specifically overruled in their decision in

2

State v. Neville.
Referring briefly to the Attorney General’s

3
4

comments on the background of this case, the motion to

5

suppress was made and granted on three separate and

6

distinct grounds, one of them being the constitutional

7

issue, one of them being the relevancy issue, and one of

8

them being the issue that the arresting officer did not

9

comply with the statutory procedure under South Dakota

10

law prior to asking for the blood alcohol test, a

11

statute which is a situation that is precedent to taking

12

that particular test.

13

The appeal was made to the South Dakota

14

Supreme Court only on the constitutional grounds.

15

other two grounds granted at the trial court level

16

remain and stand today.

17

that the statute is relevant and that a ruling that it

18

was irrelevant under the statute by the trial judge — I

19

don *t agree with that particular comment because the

20

statute as it is worded is discretionary with the trial

21

judge.

22

say it shall be admissible; it says it may be

23

admissible.

24

ruled that it was not admissible on the grounds that it

25

was irrelevant and immaterial to that particular factual

situa tion

2

The issue as it is presented to this Court is

3

solely on the constitutionality and solely on the Fifth

4

Amendment aspect of the case.

5

Respondent's position that this particular statute is

6

unconstitutional, is violative of the Fifth Amendment

7

for the reasons set forth in Schmerber v. California and

8

for the logic that follows those particular reasons.
QUESTION;

9
10
11

It is Petitioner's --

Do you think we have jurisdiction

here?
MR. GIENAPP:

I question jurisdiction, Your

12

Honor, in my reply to the writ for certiorari.

13

question whether there is jurisdiction.

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. GIENAPP;

16

QUESTION;

17

MR. GIENAPP;

I

Because of lack of finality?
Yes, Your Honor.

And that is because why?
Because of two other grounds

18

that the matter has already been suppressed on at the

19

trial court level in this particular case.

20
21

22

QUESTION;

Well, that is not finality, is it?

Is it an independent state ground of some kind?
MR. GIENAPP;

No, these are -- Yes, these are

23

independent state grounds, although they have not been

24

rule on per se by the South Dakota Supreme Court.

25

QUESTION;

Well, are you suggesting that if

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the state prevails on the constitutional issue in this

2

Court, nevertheless your courts may reaffirm the setting

3

aside of the conviction on one of the other two grounds?

4

ME. GIENAPP*

5

QUESTION*

6

MR. GIENAPP*

7

QUESTION*

Yes, Your Honor.

Or on state constitutional grounds?
That would be a possibility also.

It is curious that in the earlier

8

case that you referred to, that they made no reference

9

to any state constitutional issue.

10

MR. GIENAPP*

No, they did not, not in State

11

v. Oswald, and I don’t believe in State v. Maher did

12

they either.

13

QUESTION*

If you were to prevail on that

14

basis, the state would really be at quite a

15

disadvantage, wouldn’t it, because the Supreme Court of

16

South Dakota opinion in this case seems to speak only in

17

terms of the federal constitution.

18

were unreviewable, you would be in kind of the same

19

situation as the state of California was in the case of

20

California against Stewart.

21

trial court on the basis of the Supreme Court of South

22

Dakota's opinion, the state simply can’t use the

23

evidence and it will never have a chance to have the

24

federal question reviewed.

25

MR. GIENAPP*

And if that decision

If it goes back to the

They would have the chance to

have the federal question reviewed in a different case

2

where there was not the error in following statutory

3

procedures in advising someone of the implied consent

4

right, or —

5

QUESTION;

Not in this case.

6

MR. GIENAPP:

7

But could I follow up one further comment,

That's correct. Your Honor.

constitution.
QUESTION:

But isn't there a suggestion in the

opinion that that court views the two as coterminous?
MR. GIENAPP:

Their history has been such that

they do not.
QUESTION:

I was merely going to add that if

he is acquitted, however, the issue cannot be reviewed.
MR. GIEMAPP:

That's correct, Your Honor.

If

18

he is convicted, it would be likewise; the issue would

19

not be reviewed because I, obviously, would not raise it

20

if it were not introduced at the trial court level.

21

QUESTION:

But if we dismissed this case for

22

lack of jurisdiction and the case went back, the

23

evidence would be inadmissible, but not only for the

24

constitutional reason but for irrelevancy or —

25

MR. GIENAPP:

That is correct, and also —

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION;

1

So even if we reverse!, even if we

2

reversed the constitutional ruling, the evidence in the

3

trial court wouldn't be admissible.

4

MR. GIENAPP;

5

QUESTION;

6

MR. GIENAPP;

7

QUESTION;

That's correct, Your Honor.

Because of the other two grounds?
That's correct, Your Honor.

Did the trial judge explain why he

8

thought It was irrelevant, and if he didn't, do you have

9

any suggestion as to support that ruling?
MR. GIENAPP;

10

The trial court did not explain

11

why it was irrelevant, Your Honor, at least that I can

12

recall, and it is not in the record.

13

might very possibly be that the South Dakota statute

14

that we are referring to, of course, is discretionary,

15

as I have defined.

16

Dakota has an evidentiary rule much like the federal

17

rule which says that evidence should not be admitted

18

unless its probative value exceeds its prejudicial

19

effect, or vice-versa.

20

that I could see for a trial judge making such a

21

decision.■

22
23

My explanation

It says may be admissible.

QUESTION;

South

That would be one of the reasons

Irrelevancy was hardly the correct

label for that if that was the basis of the ruling.

no.

They did not raise those on the intermediate

QUESTION:

5
6

And if the case is tried as an

acquittal, the state cannot appeal.

7

MR. GIENAPP:

8

QUESTION:

9

10

That's correct, Your Honor.

Well, if they didn't raise those

grounds on their appeal, then aren't they the law of the
case?

11

MR. GIENAPP:

12

QUESTION:

13

Sot in this particular case,

That's correct, Your Honor.

I didn't realize that.

So this

evidence can never go in.

14

QUESTION:

In any event, no matter what.

15

QUESTION:

So that it is purely an advisory

16
17

opi nion.
MR. GIENAPP:

That is my interpretation of it,

18

and I feel that I raised that to some extent.

19

raised it in my briefs here, but I raised it.

20

22
23
24

QUESTION:

I haven't

It isn't a question of finality; it

is a question of an independent state ground, really.
MR. GIENAPP:

It is a question of finality as

to the Fifth Amendment ruling within the state.
QUESTIONi

Well, that is final enough, but it

makes the ruling irrelevant in this case.

However you

2

That is my i nterpretation of

what has taken place up to this time , Your Honor.

the petition -- or in the South Dako ta Supreme Court,

5

the South Dakota Supreme Court made the general

statement that other issues raised, we don't need to

MR. GIENAPP:

The petition for intermediate

2

appeal, sir — I don't have the case, or the page number

3

off the top of my head — is embodied in the appendix

4

for petition for a writ of certiorari, an! that would

5

specify the entire reasons for the appeal in this

6

particular case.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. GIENAPP:

9
10

You say that is in the appendix?
Yes.

It's on page A-33 of the

— excuse me — of the petition for a writ of certiorari.
QUESTION:

Well, if this case resolves itself

11

down to whether or not the trial judge abused his

12

discretion under the state statute, do you- think that is

13

the kind of a case this Court would review under any

14

circumstances, an abuse of discretion, even if it was

15

the grossest kind of abuse of discretion?

16

MR. GIENAPP;

I guess — Let me correct myself

17

in looking at this petition for intermediate appeal.

18

The petition says the appeal is from the entire order, a

19

portion which declares it unconstitutional.

20

reference is to the entire order, but the other portions

21

of the order were basically affirmed by the South Dakota

22

Supreme Coart.

23

QUESTION:

So the

Well, didn't the South Dakota

24

Supreme Court say in that regard that it affirmed the

25

order of the circuit court suppressing the admission of

2

issues raised on appeal, or deemed them to be without

3

merit.

MR. GIENAPP:

4
5

It didn't say.

merit.

Yes, that is correct.
QUESTION:

6

Or deemed them to be without

Here at A-35 it says two questions

7

are presented.

This is in the petition for intermediate

8

appeal.

9

but secondly, whether or not the defendant's statement

One is the constitutionality of the statute,

10

made after having been advised of Miranda rights and

11

after having waived those rights would in any case be

12

admissible regardless of the constitutionality of the

13

statute.

14

MR. GIENAPP:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

That's correct, Your Honor.

Doesn't that subsume the

admissibility of the statements on other grounds?
MR. GIENAPP:

That basically does not include,

18

first of all, the third ground, which relates to the

19

statutory requirements.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Why doesn't it?

It just says are

there any other reasons with respect to a disability.
QUESTION:

No.

I think isn't a fair reading

23

of that second question that it refers to the "I'm too

24

drunk" comment, which they then did reverse on and

25

remand for a hearing?

MB. GIENAPP :

2

QUESTION*

3

That's correct, Your Honor.

It doesn't refer to the question of

whether it was inadmissible because of irrelevance.
KB. GIENAPP:

4

And those were the only two

5

issues briefed, basically, in the South Dakota Supreme

6

Court, that particular situation.
QUESTION!

7

And it is correct, is it not, that

8

the state Supreme Court treated both of those issues in

9

its opinion?

10

MR. GIENAPP:

11

QUESTION:

12

Yes.

The "I’m too drunk" comment and the

constitutionality question.
MR. GIENAPP:

13

They remanded the propriety of

14

the statement for further trial court proceedings within

15

the confines of Miranda.
QUESTION:

16

Counsel, before you go on, I think

17

your brief expressly agrees that the issue before us was

18

stated correctly in the Attorney General's brief, and

19

that, of course, was only the constitutional question.

20

MR. GIENAPP:

21

QUESTION:

That's correct. Your Honor.

Of course, agreement can't confer

22

jurisdiction on us, but I'm wondering now what is your

23

position.

24
25

In other words, what do you urge us to do?
MR. GIENAPP:

Basically, Your Honor, I have no

problem with the Court deciding the issue.

I did raise

37

guestion.
QUESTION;

11

Let me see if I understand that.

12

That this evidence, if we reverse and send it back as a

13

new trial, that this evidence is not going to be

14

admitted in evidence.

And why?

MR. GIENAPP:

15

Because of the other two grounds

16

found at the trial court level for the non-admissibility

17

of this particular —

18

QUESTION;

And irrelevancy was one of them.

19

MR. GIENAPP:

20

QUESTION;

Right.

Well, suppose it is a different

21

trial judge, who might think that this was quite

22

relevant?

23
24
25

MR. GIENAPP:

Then I get into the res judicata

rule of the case situation.
QUESTION:

I would argue that —

There hasn't been any trial here,

3?

yet.

2

MR• GIENAPPi

3

QUESTION;

4

No.

It is only on appeal from denial --

or grant of a motion to suppress.
MR. GIENAPPi

5

That's correct, Your Honor.

And

6

also I feel that the third issue is so obvious under

7

South Dakota law that no new judge is going to decide

8

contrary to that because there is a South Dakota statute

9

that says these specific rights should be given, and as

10

the Attorney General indicated, the new cards weren't

11

out yet, subsequent to July 1st.
QUESTION;

12

What you are really saying is you

13

would be happy to have us give you an advisory opinion

14

on it.

15
16
17
18
19

MR. GIENAPPi

That would be a correct

assumption.
QUESTION;

Is it an advisory opinion when that

is the only question that brings you two gentlemen here?
MR. GIENAPPi

Well, you know, I followed

20

through on the appeal with good faith and obviously feel

21

that it is an issue that there is —

QUESTION:

23

MR. GIENAPPi

25

Well, you didn't ask for an appeal.
That's correct.

No, but after it was here, after it

was granted, you conceded that the constitutional issue

MR. GIENAPP;

3

I briefed only what the state

briefed in their particular brief.
QUESTION:

4

I believe I —

And we aren’t bound by what either

5

of you say, of course.

6

MR. GIENAPP;

I believe I did raise a question

7

on that regard in my reply to the petition for writ of

8

certiorari.
QUESTION;

9
10

And so you thought when we granted

the cert, that issue had been resolved by our grant.

11

MR. GIENAPP;

12

QUESTION:

13

He thought we knew what we were

doing .

14

[Laughter.]

15

MR. GIENAPP;

That’s correct. Your Honor.

That, I guess, woul d be a proper

summation of my feelings in that regard.

19

MR. GIENAPP;

Very tactful, counsel.
I feel, though, goi ng to the

20

constitutional issue, and it is Respondent' s position

21

DWI case such as this and the way it happened in this

rights, erroneously here, but advised of these rights,

Under the procedures in South Dakota in

and at the conclusion of these rights, after he is in

custody, he is compelled to give a testimonial

Let me clarify that.

If he doesn't

word, stands mute in the literal sense, do you say that

17

South Dakota law makes that testimonial?

18

MR. GIENAPP;

South Dakota law states that

19

that is a refusal. And under the Attorney General's

20

position, that just the fact of a refusal is what should

21

be introduced, if a person stood mute, that would be

22

introduced as a refusal.

23

QUESTION;

I don't necessarily say the

muteness is testimonial. I say in this particular

understanding how you can argue there is any compelled

18

MR. GIENAPP;

It is compelled, the testimonial

19

— as I indicated, it is not compelled refusal, it is

20

compelled communicative or testimonial response.

21

would be no different than a situation without the

22

benefits of Miranda where your fingerprints are being

taken, which is obviously a legitimate police function,

24

and the police officer says, "Do you really want these

25

fingerprints taken?" and you make the testimonial

nothing.

Can't you put that in evidence?

11

MR. GIENAPP;

As a defense?

Either side.

Put in evidence the

13

fact that he was asked to take a blood test and he just

No, that could be put into

evidence.

That's what I thought.

19

MR. GIENAPP;

Yes, that could be put into

evidence.

But what I am stating is that the

21

representation by the Attorney General that all they

22

wanted was the refusal into evidence, the fact of a

23

refusal, the fact of the refusal could mean many

24

things.

25

to this morning, that the constitutional issue is

I feel, as I believe Justice Stevens referred

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

there.

If it is violative of the Fifth Amendment, then

2

and in that situation it is not admissible whether it is

3

just called a refusal or the actual words are used.
If it is not violative of the Fifth Amendment,

4
5

then I think the actual words would be as admissible as

6

the fact of just a refusal because the South Dakota

7

statute does not say that the fact of refusal should be

8

admitted; the South Dakota statute merely says the

9

refusal may be admitted.
QUESTION:

10
11

Well, counsel, if it isn't

compelled, how can it violate the Fifth Amendment?
MR. GIENAPPi

It is my position it is

The individual does not have to give any

QUESTION;

He is not required to take the test

and he is not required to answer, is he?
MR. GIENAPP;

That’s correct.

He is not

18

required to take the test and he is not required — He

19

has the option, but it is a compelled option by the very

20

inquisition, and the results of that option are

21

testimonial or communicative.

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Including standing mute and saying

nothing and refusing to submit.
MR. GIENAPP:

That's correct.

But you have a

situation where the rights used state that what do you

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

want to do, do you wish to take this test?

And you are

2

not going to find a situation where someone stands mute

3

that often, because it is an actual questioning, it is

4

an actual interrogation compelling this particular

5

response.

6

Fifth Amendment seeks to protect and the dangers in this

7

type of situation are indicative in this case.

8

there was any abuse, but you have a situation where he

was advised of these rights three times.

the compelled response was not given only once but three

there is not a constitutional right for the state to

Under this

And here we have a situation where

There is a constitutional right to refuse, but

If the state's argument that it is

circumstantial evidence of guilt, if that argument is

21

carried to its logical extreme, then theoretically the

Fifth Amendment would no longer protect any

23

communication that could also be characterized as

24

circumstantial evidence of a state of mind; and I submit

25

that virtually any testimonial or communicative

statement can be interpreted and argued as being

2

circumstantial evidence of a state of mind.
The General also argues that this is necessary

3
4

to bring so juries know what went on.

5

only reason they want it is to show through compelled

6

testimonial response an inference of guilt.
QUESTIONi

7

I submit that the

Well, that is what most cases are

8

about.

Isn't the prosecution trying to show some sort

9

of inference of guilt?

10

MR. GIENAPP:

That's correct, although they

11

have stated here that their mai n concern is so that

12

there is not any question that the individual was not

13

given the opportunity to take a test -QUESTION:

14

But anyone who has tried one of

15

those cases knows that if you d on't put in the test, the

16

defense lawyer is going to get up and that is going to

17

be his big pitch to the jury: w hy didn't the state make

18

a test?

19

MR. GIENAPP:

I don't feel that it is proper,

20

and I never have — and I have tried a number

21

of these — argued, when the refusal wasn’t admitted,

22

argued why wasn't there a refusal.

improper argument by a defense counsel.

at Roman numeral III, is that based on a state statute

3

or is that a holding that failure to advise of the right

to — failure to advise that the refusal could be used

against him and failure to advise of his right to

6

counsel, are those constitutional rulings?

ruling.

10

That particular statement is not -QUESTION*

9

That would be a constitutional

That’s not based on the state

statute or the state law.
MR. GIENAPP*

11

Well, the failure to advise that

12

the refusal could be used against him was a violation of

13

state law, yes.
QUESTION;

14

Well, arguably it could be a

violation of the Federal Constitution.

said it was.

That’s correct. Your Honor.

But

That is what your motion was.

17

That is what you

Because this doesn't refer to the

statute.

23

have no power to review unless it has been raised --

It sure is.

MR. GIENAPP*

And I believe on page A-32,

then, the actual three items in the order are listed

there.

QUESTION;

Well, isn't it strange; it really

is strange that the state would appeal one ground for

excluding the evidence but it would make absolutely no

QUESTION;

I know, but it wouldn't make any

difference in this case.
MR. GIENAPP;

That's correct, Your Honor,

that's my opinion.

It's very strange.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Attorney General?

15

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK V. MEIERHENRY, ESQ.

16

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL

17

MR. MEIERHENRY;

Well, we respectfully

18

disagree with our colleague here.

19

page 4 of our brief, you will see the statute that is

20

19-13-28.1.

21

QUESTION;

22

MR. MEIERHENRY;

If you will look at

Right.
That says, notwithstanding

23

another provision, such refusal — it says that if

24

someone violates 32-23-10, such refusal is admissible

25

into evidence.

But it all hangs upon whether or not

52

1

10.1 is constitutional.

If it is not constitutional,

2

then this is a nullity because we can’t use the fruits

3

of an unconstitutional statute to admit it.
I disagree with Mr. Gienapp.

4

The relevancy

5

issue falls, and he says the right, and I would point

6

out to the Court —

7

QUESTION*

8

Yes, but will this evidence ever be

admissible?
MR. MEIERHENRY:

9

QUESTION;

10

Yes, it will.

Let’s assume that we reverse this

11

judgment and say it is quite constitutional to introduce

12

the evidence, at least as far as the Fifth Amendment is

13

concerned, it is constitutional,

14

How can you ever get the evidence in in the light of

15

these rulings in the trial court?
MR. MEIERHENRY*

16

it is not forbidden.

Very clearly, because then

17

the statute 19-13-28.1 says that the refusal evidence is

18

admissible without regard to relevancy, without regard

19

to what Mr. Gienapp misintends.

20

fact that you have to be advised that if you don’t take

21

the test, you could lose your license for a year.

22

legislature nor no court has ever said you have to be

23

advised that your refusal will be used against you.

24

That has not been — I disagree with Mr. Gienapp on that

25

point.

He refers back to the

4

Hell, here is a ruling that the

failure to advise him excludes the evidence.
MS. XEIERHENRY;

It is the state’s position

5

that should this Court find that this is constitutional,

6

the trial judge does not have the discretion and would

7

subsequently reverse his ruling.

8

first of all that it is unconstitutional.

unconstitutional —

12

QUESTION;

13

MR. MEIERHERRY:

It is irrelevant.
— it is irrelevant.

What we

14

are contending to this Court is that we need a final

15

judgment here.

16

in our state always held that it is irrelevant and it is

17

also unconstitutional, we would never get the issue

18

presented to anyone.

19

To argue otherwise as if any trial judge

QUESTION;

Well, you could always appeal that

20

to the Supreme Court of South Dakota, making it clear

21

that you appeal both points, and perhaps you have.

22

KR. MEIERHENRY:

Well, we think it is clear --

23

it was remanded back on a Miranda issue.

24

would they remand it back if it were irrevelant.

25

QUESTION;

Obviously, why

They remanded it back for

Why would we go through the

MR. MEIERHENRY;

That is perhaps true, Your

Honor.
QUESTION;

9

But if it went back to the trial

court in your state, and the judge enters and makes

11

findings and conclusions in which he just says it is

12

irrelevant, period, then that is subject to review by

13

the higher courts in the State on an abuse of discretion

14

basis, is it not?

15

MR. MEIERHENRY;

16

QUESTION;

17

That’s correct.

But would we have any authority to

review an abuse of discretion issue here?
MR. MEIERHENRY;

18

No, I don't — obviously

19

not.

It would not involve any federal question or

20

constitutional issue on the part of the state.

Thank you.
