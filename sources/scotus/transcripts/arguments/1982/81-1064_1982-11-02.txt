CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Merkin , I think you may proceed whenever

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK N. KERKIN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THF PETITIONER

MR. MERKIN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
This case concerns the important

11

constitutional questions of:

12

may an individual seek protection from the federal

13

district court against local law enforcement agencies

14

relative to the force techniques that the officers of

15

those agencies may in the future apply against such

16

individual?

17

Under what circumstances

The case also concerns the circumstances

18

where, if the court is going to entertain such a plea,

19

the federal judiciary may assume control over the force

20

techniques utilized by local law enforcement agencies.

21

I think at the outset it's important to

22

acknowledge what is almost obvious, namely that the

23

situations faced by police officers on the streets are

24

often difficult ones, and sometimes situations that most

25

of us are unable easily to relate to.

Secondly, from

speaking of use of force, with the kinds of questions

that are often faced, for example, in deciding upon

military tactics.

resolution.

These are very difficult of

7

Now, there are really two decisions from the

8

Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that are at issue here,

9

and the city of course submits that they were

10

erroneously reasoned.

11

the most important and significant defects in the

12

reasoning of those two opinions, it may be helpful to

13

have some background in this matter, in particular with

14

reference to recent developments which may or may not

15

affect the justiciability of the case.

16

know, the city believes that the case is not moot and

17

needs to be resolved.

18

But before going to the defects,

As you probably

But, beginning with the beginning, about five

19

and a half years ago the Respondent Mr. Lyons filed an

20

action in federal district court seeking both a

21

declaration and an injunction against the Los Angeles

22

police department to limit the use of the

23

unconscious-rendering control holds to situations where

24

an officer is faced with deadly force.

25

that’s the effective prohibition of such holds.

We submit that

CORRECTED
And his primary theory end the theory that

2

developed was that the control holds shock, the

3

conscience.

4

control holds shock the conscience intrinsically, having

5

little to do, if anything, with the training of the

6

officers, but they’re intrinsically of the kind that

7

shock the conscience.
Sow, the control holds of which we speak are

And the Respondent's position is that the

neck restraints that are really of two different

10

fundamental varieties.

The first are techniques that

11

officers apply with their arm on both sides of the neck,

12

to put pressure on the carotid arteries which transmit

13

oxygenated blood to the brain.

14

techniques known as bar-arm restraints, which rely upon

15

pressure of the forearm against the front of the neck

16

and the trachial tube.

The second family are

The purpose of both of those techniques is to

17
18

assume control of the individual, and in the vast

19

majority — and the record demonstrates this — people

20

submit.

21

reflects and the district court found, of rendering

22

people unconscious if necessary, whereupon they can be

23

turned onto their belly, which is the typical approach,

24

and handcuffed such that that person is now in control.

25

They do have the potential, as the record

Now, these are techniques that officers are

MR. YERKIN:

The district court

10

certainly had that issue before it, but the fundamental

11

error here is legal.

12

Blackmun, it has to do with the legal standards that

13

were demanded of the district court upon review in the

14

Lyons II decision, as we call it, the review of the

15

preliminary injunction.

16

More specifically, Mr. Justice

We submit that the Court of Appeals failed to

17

look for the application of the appropriate legal

18

standards, and those legal standards of which I speak

19

are really two and they are quite related.

20

standard that derives from principles of federalism and

21

equity, which says that the federal courts should only

22

assume control over the activities, let’s say, of a

police department in the most extraordinary

circumstances.

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

reason for that is that the city submits that this is

2

the kind of thing that is subject to reasonable debate,

3

indeed there's a debate going on, not just within city

4

government but to some extent nationwide; and that these

5

decisions, especially in this particular situation, are

6

such that there may be tentative decisions such as we

7

have already now from the city of Los Angeles, that are

8

subject to change and modification.

Yes, and

I can tell you a little

15

bit about how and on what basis that decision will be

made, I believe.

17

Angeles police department is a five-member board of

18

police commissioners, who are civilians appointed by the

19

mayor and confirmed by a 15-member city council.

that these tactics are constitutional.

14

chiefs of police, reasonable experts, can differ, and so

long as that's the case we're not in the extreme

16

situation where reasonable people, reasonable people who

17

are informed and have reflected on the subject, are

18

going to concur that these tactics are not civilized,

19

they're barbaric, and they cannot be tolerated in this

society.

35. XERKIKs

I think the policy is derived

from two different notions.

The first is the standard

No, no.

What is the policy that

4

you want this Court to in effect say the city is free to

adopt if it wants to?

6

and under what circumstances, in your view?
MR. MERKIN;

7

When could the city use the holds

Returning to the description of

8

the control holds themselves, the latitude that I think,

9

Justice O'Connor, that we speak of is to use the holds

10

in circumstances such as they were most recently used

11

before.

12

government has yet to decide that, if it chooses to use

13

the holds, whether it will want that extent of

14

latitude.

15

Now, that is one possibility, but the city

It may, for example, compromise and may

16

prescribe the holds are to be used in some circumstances

17

but perhaps not in others.

18

city government wants the full constitutional latitude.

19

QUESTION;

But I think they want -- the

Would it be all right if the rule

20

said that they should only use it unless the application

21

of such force is necessary to prevent serious bodily

harm to the officer?

to that point was broader.

Merkin.

10

You need not, to support the reversal

What you can do is say that the Ninth Circuit

12

conclusions of law should have been looking for some

13

particular things.

14

have looked for was a finding that there was a clearly

15

superior alternative; moreover, that this clearly

16

superior alternative -- and there had to be some gross

17

disparity between the alternative and the technique

18

before the court -- was prevalent nationwide.

and straighten out all these factual matters.

MS. MERKINi

Yes.

was applied was not reasonable and necessary, then there

MR. MERKIN:

Now, the injunction

Apparently so.

Eut there are

circumstances where an officer has yet to be in a

situation where he or she is faced with a very serious

threat to his or her well-being, which might require the

7

pulling of a baton if the officer has a baton or the

8

pulling of the revolver where there's a threat to the

9

officer's life, but it may escalate very quickly.

And

10

one thing that’s very important is for an officer to

11

take control of a situation to prevent the escalation.
We're speaking of a grappling physical

12

13

encounter between two individuals, and the sooner that

the officer has control of the other person's body and

QUESTION;

9

The

If you're looking at the city

Almost always -Isn't that what the training manual

Yes, that's the policy.
And so you have to count -- as far

18

as the city's liability is concerned or as far as the

validity of the policy is concerned, the control hold is

20

only applied, supposedly, if there's been resistance to

21

the arrest.

22

t

NR. NERKIN ;

Yes, but there's one additional

23

predicate I would add here, that it's only where the

24

officer has tried lower force techniques and they

25

failed, or at the time it just didn't seem reasonable to

try to twist the arm or bend the wrist to cause pain.

2

What they do teach the officers is to escalate and

3

de-escalate the level of force to no higher level than

4

necessary to control somebody.

5

QUESTION:

Well, again — again, my question

6

still stands.

7

control holds are authorized only when there's

8

resistance,

9

As far as the policy is concerned,

when it's necessary to use force.

ME. MERKIN;

When it's necessary to use force,

10

that is correct.

11

use them at the officer's complete discretion.

12

That is the policy.

QUESTION*

And it's not to

Well, if the person to be arrested

13

or confronted is entirely peaceful, there would never be

14

an occasion to use a control hold, as far as the policy

15

is concerned.

16

ME. MERKIN;

That is correct, and that is

17

Respondent's — Respondent’s charge here is that when he

18

had his encounter with the officer department the

19

control hold was put on for no reason whatsoever, that

20

he did nothing to prompt it.

21

QUESTION;

22
23

That's a violation of the

regulation, or it's a violation of his duty.

QUESTION’:

2

Well, in terms of standing, in

3

terms of showing some future risk, to himself, he would

4

have to show that, not only that he is liable to be

5

stopped for a traffic incident again, but another

6

policeman is likely to disobey his orders.

7

MP . MERKIN:

There are two cases he's

8

bringing, in a sense.

9

there's the hidden case.

There’s the primary case and then
The primary case is, you have

10

to be fearful that the hold would be applied according

11

to policy, and that's his Monell theory.
QUESTION:

12

Well, I know.

But if it’s applied

13

according to policy, the predicate for that is that he

14

resists.

15

MR. MERKIN:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

That’s correct.
That he resists, and in short that

he is committing an illegal act himself.
MR. MERKIN:

Yes.

And the other, the hidden

19

case that he is in a sense is that the control hold is

20

applied without provocation.

21

different case, and whatever the probabilities may be

22

with regard to the policy, they’ve got to be, hopefully,

23

incredibly remote with regard to out of policy

application of the control holds.

citizen who is fearful of that has standing to go into

the courts and stop the practice of hot pursuit?
MR. MITCHELL;

5

Well, Your Honor, it's a

complex question.

What you need to know, of course, is

7

whether or not that citizen, I believe, has a

8

justifiable fear of real immediate injury.

9

Let's assume, then, that on one

10

occasion a police car in hot pursuit collided with his

11

car and did very substantial damage and injured him.

Now, with that addition, does he have standing?
