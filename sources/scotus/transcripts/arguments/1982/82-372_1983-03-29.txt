ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. GELLER:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

This is a Freedom of Information Act case in

12

which the Respondent, Grolier Incorporated, saeks access

13

to work product prepared by Federal Trade Commission

14

attorneys for a civil action that ended several years

15

ago.

16

ground that the documents were protected by the attorney

17

work product privilege and were therefore exempt from

18

disclosure under Exemption 5 of the FOIA.

19

The Commission denied the FOIA request on the

Exemption 5 protects against mandatory

20

disclosure of memorandums or letters that would not be

21

available by law to a party in litigation with the

22

agency, and it's quite clear from the legislative

23

history of the FOIA and from this Court's decisions that

24

Exemption 5 incorporates the work product privilege and

25

is intended to protect the work product of Government

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

attorneys against mandatory public disclosure.

2

The Court of Appeals nonetheless ordered the

3

documents disclosed.

4

attorney work product from terminated litigation remains

5

privileged only when litigation related to the

6

terminated action exists or potentially exists.

The D.C. Circuit held that

We have sought review of this holding because

7

8

it*s contrary to every other appellate ruling on the

9

temporal scope of the work product privilege and because

10

it would have a particularly devastating effect on the

11

conduct and working papers of Government attorneys.

12

Now, the facts of this case can be briefly

13

stated.

14

against the Americana Corporation, which is a wholly

15

owned subsidiary of Grolier, charging Americana with

16

violating a

17

false advertising and misrepresentations in the door to

18

door sale of encyclopedias.

19

1976 when the FTC refused to comply with a discovery

20

order requiring it to turn over certain documents

21

relating to a covert investigation of Americana's sales

22

techniques.

23

In 1972 the Government brought a civil action

1949

cease and

desist order prohibiting

The suit was dismissed in

In 1978 Grolier brought this FOIA suit seeking

24

access to records relating to the Americana

25

investigation.

In response, the FTC turned over

a
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

literally 7,000 pages of documents, but it withheld a

2

very few documents on the ground of attorney work

3

product.

4

The district court conducted an in camera

5

examination of the disputed documents and agreed with

6

the FTC that they constituted attorney work product.

7

The district court found that the documents encompassed

8

opinions by FTC attorneys regarding the evidentiary

9

needs of the Americana action and discussed specific

10

methods of obtaining evidence for use in that

11

litigation.

12

The district court therefore found that the

13

documents fell squarely within the work product

14

privilege and were therefore exempt from disclosure

15

under Exemption 5 of the F0IA.

16

QUESTIONI

Mr. Geller, are these documents

17

among those that were refused to be disclosed pursuant

18

to the 1976 order?

19

ME. GELLEEi

20

QUESTION;

21
22
23

I believe they are.
So they’re the same documents in

both cases?
MR. GELLER;

I believe some of them are the

same documents.

24

As I noted a moment ago —

25

QUESTION;

And the Government took no appeal

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

or sought review in any way?
MR. GELLERs

That’s correct, of the dismissal

of the Americana action.

4

QUESTIONS

5

MR. GELLERi

6

The Court of Appeals --

7

QUESTION

Yes.
Yes.

And Mr. Geller, in the earlier

8

action, as I understand it, the district court had

9

actually ordered that the documents be disclosed under

10

11

Rule 26; is that right?
MR. GELLERi

Yes.

The district court found

12

that Americana had made a sufficient showing of need for

13

the documents and of hardship to overcome the qualified

14

privilege that attached to the documents, and the judge

15

ordered the disclosure of the documents.

16

not disclosed and instead the suit was dismissed.

17

QUESTION;

But they were

Why can’t we say that if a district

18

court has ordered disclosure then that's within the

19

category of documents referred to by Sears that are

20

routinely disclosed?

21

MR. GELLERs

Well, I think what the Court —

22

what the exemption means and what the Court said in

23

Sears is that Exemption 5 protects against documents,

24

disclosure of documents that would not be routinely

25

disclosed in the sense that are not subject to any

2

privilege
But work product documents, even the documents

3

involved in this case, are not routinely disclosed.

4

They were only disclosed in the Americana action because

5

that particular plaintiff was able to make a sufficient

6

showing of need.

7
8

9

But if —

QUESTION*

But I suppose they are routinely

disclosed if the court orders them to be disclosed.
MR. GELLERs

Well, that can't be what the

10

exemption means or what this Court meant when it used

11

the phrase "normally privileged," or else it would wipe

12

out all qualified privileges, because every qualified

13

privilege by definition can be overcome by a sufficient

14

showing of need.

15

documents that would be routinely disclosed.

16

But that's not the category of

I think what the legislative history clearly

17

shows is that Exemption 5 was meant to protect documents

18

that are subject to absolute or qualified privileges,

19

and clearly it meant to encompass documents subject to

20

the work product privilege.

21

Now, the D.C. Circuit reversed and, even

22

though it agreed that these documents were

23

unquestionably subject to the work product privilege,

24

the court noted that the Americana action, the action as

25

to which these documents had been prepared, had ended.

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

And the court announced that in its view the work

2

product privilege should not extend beyond the

3

termination of the litigation for which the documents

4

were prepared, except where litigation related to that

5

first litigation exists or potentially exists.

6

The court, however, quickly rejected the

7

notion that an FOIA suit such as Grolier's here could be

8

considered a related action, and then it announced that

9

it*didn’t appear that there were any other related

10

actions in existence or on the horizon.

11

court remanded the case to the district court to

12

reassess the work product claim in light of the test it

13

announced in regard to related litigation and in light

14

of the fact that the court suggested that there was no

15

so-called related litigation in existence.

16

Therefore, the

We believe that the Court of Appeals decision

17

is plainly wrong for two independent reasons;

18

the court's interpretation of the duration of the work

19

product privilege is fundamentally inconsistent with the

20

underlying purposes of the privilege, and it creates a

21

test that’s frankly unworkable.

22

First,

And second, even if the Court of Appeals were

23

correct in its ruling as to the temporal scope of the

24

work product privilege and the fact that it’s not

25

perpetual in civil discovery, that wouldn't mean that

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

those same qualifications exist under the FOIA because,

2

as I mentioned a moment ago in responding to the

3

question of Justice O'Connor, documents may be obtained

4

under the FOIA only if they would be routinely

5

discoverable in civil litigation, in other words not

6

subject to any privilege.

7

Circuit's newfangled work product test, attorney work

8

product from terminated litigation would not be

9

routinely disclosed in subsequent litigation, but would

10

only be disclosed when certain additional criteria are

11

met.

12

QUESTIONS

And even under the D.C.

Mr. Geller, your argument suggests

13

that there's a lot more analytical coherence to that

14

exemption than I've ever thought there was.

15

really think that the language "routinely disclosed" and

16

so forth lends itself to rather precise application

17

based on analogies to ordinary civil lawsuits?

18

MB. GELLEEi

Do you

The Court has suggested in cases

19

like EPA against Mink that just by virtue of the nature

20

of FOIA litigation, for example, the plaintiff needn't

21

make any showing of need.

22

privileges have to be applied by way of rough

23

analogies.

24

left no doubt in cases such as Sears and Roebuck and

25

Federal Open Market Committee that Exemption 5 was

plainly intended to incorporate the work, product

2

privilege.

3

The legislative history of the Act shows that

4

it was intended to apply under the FOIA just as it does

5

in civil litigation, and it's quite clear that work

product is always subject to a privilege.

8

with non-opinion work product.

that it's not routinely discoverable.
QUESTION*

Isn't there a problem, though, in

12

carrying over the statutory language when you have a

13

totally abstract defendant, the Government, and there

14

isn't any live lawsuit, in which you can ordinarily draw

15

the conclusions you have to draw and decide whether to

16

allow discovery of something or not?

17

a half a lawsuit.

18

NR. GELLER*

It's just kind of

I think that’s one of the severe

19

problems with applying the D.C. Circuit's related

20

litigation test in the context of a FOIA case, which I

21

hope to get to in a little while.

22

Sears and Roebuck that the work product privilege

23

applies in the FOIA context and that a plaintiff's need

24

for it is to be assessed under the least compelling

25

circumstances.

But it's clear from

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

In other words, it’s analogized to a plaintiff

2

who in civil discovery could show nothing more than mere

3

relevance.

4

a plaintiff who can show nothing more than mere

5

relevance is not entitled to work product, because it's

6

subject to a qualified privilege and he has to show more

7

than mere relevance, he has to show need and hardship.

8

10

And it's quite clear that in civil discovery

QUESTION*

Hr. Geller, does Exemption 5 also

encompass material that’s part of the deliberative
process within a Government agency?

11

MR. GELLER:

12

QUESTION*

Yes, it does.
And could the Government have

13

claimed a privilege under that aspect of the rule in

14

this case?

15

MR. GELLER:

Well, as to certain documents the

16

Government did, as to the work product documents in this

17

case.

18

to the files or memoranda that are not being written to

19

a final decisionmaker but are merely being written in

20

order to assess various aspects of a particular

21

litigation, and therefore those documents may not fall

22

within the deliberative process privilege, although they

23

would seem clearly to fall within the work product

24

privilege, as both the district court and the Court of

25

Appeals in this case held.

Many of them are memoranda, for example, either

So while in some categories of cases there may­

2

be an overlap between the two privileges, in this case I

3

don’t think there is an overlap and in a great many

4

cases there wouldn’t be an overlap.

5

would have available to it would be the work product

privilege.

QUESTION;

All the Government

And Exemption 7 would not have

covered the Government’s request here, I take it?

9

HR. GELLER;

Well, Exemption 7 has a number of

10

facets to it.

11

a pending enforcement action, but you also have to show

12

that it falls into one of the other categories of

13

documents that are protected from mandatory disclosure,

14

and no Exemption 7 claim was made here.

Not only do you have to show that there's

15

But it's quite clear this was work product and

16

Congress intended work product to be incorporated within

17

Exemption 5.

18

absolutely clear from the legislative history of the

19

FOIA and from this Court’s decisions interpreting that

20

exemption.

21

That is one of the very few things that is

Now, I’d like to begin by discussing the first

22

of the flaws in the Court of Appeals opinion.

I think

23

it's fair to say that the principal purpose of the work

24

product privilege is to create a zone of privacy within

25

which a lawyer can prepare his case without having to

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

worry that the memos he writes will later be freely

2

disclosed to his adversaries in a way that could harm

3

him or his clients.

4

This Court in the seminal case of Hickman

5

against Taylor explained the harms that would occur to

6

the adversary system if work product materials were not

7

subject to at least a qualified privilege in civil

8

discovery.

9

thoughts down in writing and inefficiency and unfairness

Attorneys would be reluctant to put their

11

and in the preparation of cases for trial.

12

t QUESTION:

Hr. Geller, may I ask you a kind of

13

a -- maybe it’s not very helpful, but in the

14

attorney-client privilege area, the privilege belongs to

15

the client.

16

owns the privilege, whether the client or the lawyer?

In the work product area, is it clear who

2

QUESTIONi

3

HR. GELLER*

I understand.
Many of the documents that are

4

put together would be quite harmful to the client if

5

disclosed and the lawyer might have a fiduciary

6

obligation not to disclose those documents in a way that

7

would harm the client.

8

involving a waiver question, which this case doesn’t

9

raise, you would look perhaps as to whether the lawyer

has made —
QUESTIONi

But you would think in this case,

12

for example, if the lawyer who ran this investigation,

13

whoever it may be, had left the Government service and

14

decided he was willing to waive the privilege, you'd

15

probably assume ha could do so?

16

MR. GELLERi

Well, the papers that were being

17

prepared were not his personal papers.

papers of the Government.

21

private practice.

22

They're the

In Government

But this case certainly doesn’t raise any

23

question of waiver of the privilege.

If for example the

24

Government had disclosed these documents in the

25

Americana litigation in response to the discovery order,

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

perhaps there would be a question of waiver in a

2

subsequent FOIA case.

3

QUESTION i

Mr. Geller, I don't mean to be

4

technical, but whose property is the work papers, the

5

Government's or the lawyer's?

6

property?

7

8

MR. GELLERi

Isn't it the Government's

I think it would be the property

of the Government, yes.

9

QUESTIONS

That's what I thought.

10

MR. GELLERs

11

QUESTION;

Yes.
But you wouldn't carry that — you

12

don't intimate any analogy as between a private lawyer

13

and his client?

The ownership.
No.
The private lawyer owns —
Yes.
— and absolutely controls the work

product.
MR. GELLERs

That's my understanding.

That's

my understanding.
QUESTION;

But when the Government has a

24

lawyer, the Government and the lawyer are more or less

25

merged into one, are they not?

1

MR. GELLERi

I think that's one of the

2

problems with answering Justice Stevens' question in the

3

context of Government litigation.

4

the answer to that question is material to the outcome

5

of a case such as this under the Freedom of Information

6

Act.

Now, the concerns that I was mentioning

24

earlier about why there is a work product privilege in

25

the first place are perhaps most compelling during the

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

period when a case is being litigated, but it seems to

2

us it's equally clear that many of the harms that the

3

work, product privilege is designed to avoid would be

4

almost as likely to occur if the privilege were to end

5

with the termination of the litigation for which the

6

documents were prepared, because attorneys would still

7

be reluctant to commit certain thoughts to writing if

8

they realized that they'd have to share those thoughts

9

with an opponent at any time, not just while the case is

10

alive.

11

And if attorneys did prepare memoranda that

12

might reflect unfavorably on them or their clients or

13

their legal theories, they perhaps would have a

14

tremendous incentive to destroy those documents at the

15

time the case ended if the work product privilege ended

16

at the same time.

17

inefficiencies in the giving of legal advice or in the

18

preparation of cases for trial.

19

This took would lead to

The principal reason that's generally given

20

for construing privileges narrowly is that it inhibits

21

the search for truth.

22

search for truth would be enhanced by a rule that led

23

people to destroy documents rather than take a chance

24

that they might have to be turned over at some later

25

time •

But it's hard to see how the

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

So essentially for these reasons, there's

2

unanimity or general agreement among the lower courts

3

that the work product privilege really can't cease at

4

the time the litigation ceases, but has to to some

5

extent retain its privilege status thereafter.

6

D.C. Circuit agreed with that in this case, because they

7

held that the privilege survives in certain instances

8

where there's related litigation or potential for

9

related litigation.

10

Even the

But it seems to us that that test is not

11

responsive to the concerns that underlie the work

12

product privilege and it's not at all workable in

13

practice.

14

conclude that the harms associated with allowing

15

discovery of work product are limited to discovery in

16

so-called related actions.

17

great when discovery is made in a so-called unrelated

18

action.

19

First of all, I think it's plainly wrong to

The harm can be equally as

But even if we were to accept the Court of

20

Appeals' premise that there are differences about

21

so-called related and unrelated actions, the principal

22

flaw in the D.C. Circuit's test is that it's impossible

23

to apply the test.

24

has to be a substantial degree of certainty,

25

The Court observed in Hickman against Taylor

that if attorneys know that their work product is

QUESTION:

If you're right in your analysis of

what the routine discovery language of Exemption 5

19

has shown is relevancy —

20

HR. GELLER;

21

QUESTION:

22

Yes.
— then I presume that work product

would be almost automatically denied?
MR. GELLER:

23

I think that is what Congress

24

intended.

That — first of all, what I said about what

25

Exemption 5 means is I think exactly what the Court said

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

in Sears, in NLRB against Sears and Roebuck, in which

2

they said, the Court said, that a requester under the

3

FOIA is to be judged, is to be put in the place of a

4

person in civil litigation with the least compelling

5

need for the information.

6

cannot make any showing of need, who cannot overcome any

7

qualified privileges.

8

9

In other words, someone who

And I’d say it would be quite bizarre if that
wasn’t what Congress intended, because if that wasn’t

10

what Congress intended Congress would have been

11

repealing the work product privilege and every other

12

qualified privilege in Government litigation, because it

13

would mean that any person in litigation with the

14

Government who couldn’t make the showing of need

15

necessary to overcome the privilege in civil litigation

16

would just file an FOIA request and he would get it.

17
18
19

It's quite clear from the legislative history
that that’s not what Congress had in mind.
I should add that this whole notion of work

20

product privilege as restricted to so-called related

21

cases is based on a rather myopic and I think naive view

22

of litigation, especially Government litigation, because

23

especially with Government litigation it's hardly the

24

case that the Government's interests end when a

25

particular case ends.

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Each case is generally part of a much larger

2

litigative scheme.

3

unfair method of competition case against Americana was

4

just part of the FTC's continuing efforts to police the

5

marketplace to eliminate deceptive practices, and much

6

of the work product is not related to one particular

7

case but may lay out the Government's litigative

8

strategies in a whole range of cases.

9

In this case, for example, this

It would be quite useful to potential

10

adversaries of the Government or regulatees to wait

11

until some case terminates and then get the work product

12

for that case.

13

not particularly shy about why it wants this work

14

product.

15

of the joint appendix, Grolier says that it wants the

16

information in this case which is subject to the work

17

product privilege because Grolier is a Respondent in an

18

above-mentioned adjudicative proceding that was then

19

before the FTC, and plaintiff, that is Grolier, believes

20

that such records may have some bearing on certain

21

issues raised in that proceeding.

22

In fact, Grolier in this very case is

In its complaint which is reprinted at page 12

And in a letter that Grolier sent

23

contemporaneously to the FTC in connection with its FOIA

24

request for these work product documents, it says;

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

"We

1

believe such records may have some bearing on certain

2

issues raised in another pending FTC proceeding against

3

Grolier raising similar sorts of unfair method of

4

competition issues."

5

So I think it would be devastating and it

6

could not have been within the contemplation of Congress

7

that this sort of work product material would have to be

8

given over even if the case, one case, may technically

9

have ended.

10

Finally, the related litigation test is flawed

11

because it's wholly unresponsive to the concerns

12

underlying the privilege, because it ignores the fact

13

that subsequent unrelated litigation often precedes the

14

institution of related litigation.

15

request were made at the time when there was no

16

litigation pending, then the materials would have to be

17

given over and then people could use that to bring a

18

related suit.

And if the FOIA

would help the judge make a determination as to whether

So if I understand what the D.C. Circuit is

comes in for documents in a previous suit the agency and

ultimately the courts must ask themselves whether there

as yet undascribed way to the subject matter of the

5

This is I think unworkable in practice.

We

6

find it hard to believe that that's what Congress meant

when they made clear that Exemption 5 incorporates the

work product privilege, and we would ask this Court to

9

reject that view of the work product privilege in the

The Government of course has a great deal of

3

difficulty with that argument, and so Mr. Seller and the

4

briefs present a syllogism, and there is some

5

practicality or simplicity to it, but upon examination

6

it falls apart.

7

Here is what the Government saysi

Point number ones

Documents are available

under FOIA only if "routinely available" in civil

9

litigation.

10

Point number twos

To get work product

11

documents in civil litigation under Rule 26 you always

12

have to show some need.

13

The Government therefore concludes that you

14

may never in a FOIA case ever get work product because

15

to get work product you would necessarily have had to

16

make a showing of need in the private litigation.

17

That, Your Honor, is simply inconsistent with

18

what this Court has said.

19

in his concurring opinion in NLRB against Robbins, which

20

this Court cited with approval in Merrill, makes it very

21

clear that the work product standards under the Civil

22

Rules of Procedure are not as broad as work product

23

under FOIA.

24

Court has directed work product to be produced in FOIA

25

cases.

Justice Powell, for instance,

Indeed, there are circumstances where this

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

For instance, some courts have read the Sears

2

opinion to say work product of a factual nature which

3

winds up in a final opinion is produceable.

4

four circuits have held — Deering Milliken and the

5

Robbins case, and the Fifth Circuit reversed on other

6

grounds — have said purely factual work product is

7

available.

8
9

At least

The Government's argument necessarily would
have to have this Court accept the proposition that work

10

product is never available in FOIA.

11

this Court has ever said and it would have this Court

12

overrule four different Circuits which have said that.

That is not what

13

The only point, to respond again to the Chief

The only point — that's this case.

3

That is

4

the facts of this case.

The only point I am making and

5

that we make in our briefs on that issue — and again, I

6

don’t suggest the Court need reach it, but I think it's

7

important to understand the type of documents we’re

8

talking about.
The point that we are making, that if those

9

10

had been the facts of Hickman versus Taylor I

11

respectfully suggest that the rule announced by the

12

Court in that opinion would have been substantially

13

different.
QUESTION;

14

I’m not sure where you say that,

15

Mr. Mason.

It was my impression that Hickman against

16

Taylor laid down the work product rule that work product

17

was not ordinarily or routinely discoverable unless in

18

cases of real dire necessity where the other party

19

simply couldn’t get the information in any other way.
Now, if it’s relevant information, which I

20
21

assume you think yours is, I don't see why this is the

22

kind of information that couldn't be gotten in some

23

other way.

25

MR. MASON:

Your Honor, Your Honor is talking

about the Howerton documents, how we could have gotten

36

those in some other way?

2

QUESTION;

3

ME. MASON;

4

Yes.
Your Honor, we asked for those

documents --

5

QUESTION;

6

MR. MASON;

Why were they relevant, anyway?
Your Honor, the reason they were

7

relevant is because the Federal Trade Commission had

8

filed an action against Americana Corporation alleging

9

all types of violations of a cease and desist order.

10

Mr. Howerton’s own concession he had to get

11

"supplemental evidence” to buttress that claim, and he

12

did it in a manner which was inconsistent --

13

QUESTION:

By

Well, have you ever tried a lawsuit

14

in which you didn’t have to go out and get supplemental

15

evidence, sometimes during — while witnesses were

testifying?

17

18

You never know how your case is going to

MR. MASON;

Your Honor, Justice Rehnquist, the

19

only point we are making — and it is not a big point in

20

our appeal, but I want to be responsive to Your Honor's

21

questions -- the only point we are making is that the

22

documents that were generated here were generated as a

23

result of an effort by counsel for plaintiff, counsel

24

for the Government, in litigation against defendant,

25

which instructed his client to go, after a lawsuit had

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

been started, after counsel had been retained by the

2

defendant, and try to go and get some supplemental

3

information or so-called evidence without telling the

4

lawyer for the other side.

5

We believe that that —

6

QUESTION*

Why on earth would you tell the

7

lawyer for the other side?

8

from having any use.

9

NR. MASON*

He'd probably prevent it

Your Honor, because Disciplinary

10

Rule 7.104 says that after a lawsuit is filed and the

11

other side hires a lawyer you, the lawyer for one party,

12

can't approach the other defendant on the subject of the

13

representation or the litigation without advising the

14

lawyer who represents the other party.

15

QUESTION*

Mr. Mason, didn't you a few minutes

16

ago tell the Chief Justice you were not raising any

17

ethical points?

18

MR. MASON*

19

QUESTION*

20

MR. MASON*

21

QUESTION*

22

MR. MASON*

Your Honor —
Didn't you?
Yes, Your Honor.

That's correct.

So now you're raising them.
Because Justice Rehnquist asked me

23

the question, Your Honor, and I wanted to be

24

responsive.

25

But that is absolutely correct.

Now, Your Honors, I have suggested and we have

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

suggested in our brief a very narrow grounds upon which

2

the judgment could be affirmed below, and that is merely

3

to say these documents were available in litigation to a

4

party, they were ordered produced, therefore Exemption 5

5

doesn't apply, and the Court on those narrow grounds

6

could affirm that judgment.

7

QUESTION*

Mr. Mason, do you think then we

8

should adopt a principle that — supposing it's not

9

Judge Fisher in New Jersey but Judge Schmaltz in

10

Wisconsin, and he files a perfectly bizarre order

11

directing the Government to disclose information which

12

they would much rather dismiss their lawsuit than

13

conform to.

14

would look at Judge Schmaltz* order, except Judge

15

Schmaltz, would think it's just off the wall.

16
17

And say all members of any court which

Do you think nonetheless that in an FOIA
proceeding one is bound by a discovery order?

18

MR. MASON:

I would assume, Your Honor, the

Government does not appeal Judge Schmaltz's outrageous

order —

QUESTION:

Well, you can't really appeal a

You can get a mandamus on it.

MR. MASON:

Your Honor, a lot of times the

25

did in Leggett Z. Platt, and appeal that up to the

They'd have to show that they were not

Moreover, the Government's argument that it

has to be routinely available, which they take from

8

Senate Report 813 and this Court's statement in Sears,

9

was concerned about the hypothetical plaintiff.

10

not forget, it is conceivable that one could conjure up

11

a hypothetical plaintiff in civil litigation who might

be able to show need for a certain document.

13

what the Court was concerned about.

14

That is

Mr. Geller's statement that it is improper to

15

order these documents produced on the theory of

16

routinely available misconstrues the legislative history

17

that this Court has talked about and that clearly is set

18

forth in Senate Rule 813.

19

I'd like Your Honors — and if Your Honors

20

want to reach the judgment of the Court of Appeals, I'd

21

like to address that issue also.

22

is simply incorrect when he states that the Court of

First of all, counsel

Those cases indeed hold in the civil

under Buie 26, that work product will not terminate

6

not inconsistent with FIOA.

7

Those are Rule 26 cases,

But more important, in each of those circuit

8

court opinions, Your Honor, the courts have said, we

9

might not hold this but for the fact that work product

10

is qualified.

11

those circuit court opinions the plaintiffs, if they

12

were able to make a showing, could still get those

documents.

14

Therefore, even under the holdings in

And indeed, Your Honor, in Leggett 6 Platt the

15

this rule, if the plaintiff can show in the district

simply not correct.

I refer to Justice White's concurring opinion

And Justice White noted in that concurrence,

QUESTION:

3

MR. MASON:

Still just a concurrence.
It is a concurrence, Your Honor,

4

but I think the language is very persuasive.

5

White says in the concurring opinions

6

Hickman versus Taylor didn’t say there was a privilege

7

for work product.

8

examines Hickman versus Taylor, the Court says the

9

documents are not available because they’re not

11

Justice

Point number one,

Indeed, if the Court carefully

discoverable under Rule 26.
Justice White went further and said, there was

12

some reason the Supreme Court in Hickman versus Taylor

13

said, it’s not a privilege, it's simply not

14

discoverable, because the Court wanted to leave open the

15

possibility, as I read Justice White's opinion, that

16

maybe this material, this so-called work product, would

17

be available post-discovery.

18

Justice White also points out in that

19

concurring opinion the reasons for having the work

20

product privilege in discovery, i.e., that a lawyer, be

21

it a Government lawyer or anybody else, would not want

22

to amass the information for fear his adversary will get

23

it, is evaporated at trial.

24

evaporated at trial, clearly it’s evaporated when the

25

litigation is dismissed.

A fortiori, if it is

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

And the D.C. Circuit went farther than that.

It said if there's any related litigation you're not

3

going to get it, and if there's any potentially related

4

litigation.

QUESTION:

6

MR. MASON:

QUESTION:

Mr. Mason.
Yes, Your Honor.
May I ask you a point on that

8

question.

9

penalty action, is that correct?

The action that was terminated was the

10

MR. MASON:

11

QUESTION:

Yas, sir.
And that was an action to penalize

12

Crolier-Americana for violating a 1948 order, was that

13

not it?

14

MR. MASON:

15

QUESTION:

18
17

Yes, sir.
Is the 1948 order still on the

books ?
MR. MASON:

Your Honor, I believe the FTC —

18

and we're representing Americana.

19

on the books, there is still a consent decree.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

I believe it is still

Well, isn't there a possibility

that that order might be violated in the future?
MR. MASON:

Your Honor, I would not want to

23

suggest that my client would do that, but yes, there

24

could be a possibility, but that is a pending case.

25

There is a consent degree.

That case is not

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

2

issue of what is related and what is not related is not

3

before this Court, I might readily agree if Your Honor

4

is suggesting that we couldn’t — that that would be a

5

bar to getting documents.

6

That is a pending case.

And although the

But I would say that, Your Honor, the D.C.

7

Circuit’s opinion carefully made it very helpful for the

8

Government because of the fact that if there’s a consent

9

degree pending, it just hasn’t been terminated and

10

perhaps under Justice White’s rule in Nobles the

11

documents could be had.

12

Circuit they couldn’t, and I think. Your Honor, that

13

should give ample protection to the Government.

But certainly under the D.C.

14

Now one other point that I think is —

15

QUESTIONS

Well, let me just make sure.

I’m

16

not totally sure I understand you.

If an identical

17

proceeding to the one that was filed in

18

filed again and the Government wanted to use the same

19

investigative technique and the same appraisal of

20

evidence that may be disclosed in these documents, why

21

wouldn't these documents then be related to that

22

potential litigation?

'72 or '76 were

23

I don't quite understand your answer.

24

MR. MASON;

25

Your Honor, because under the D.C.

Circuit’s rules the litigation must be terminated and,

44
ALDER SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

step two, there must be no related litigation.

2

Your Honor's hypothetical, in fact as the case is, if

3

there is a consent degree which is still on file in a

4

federal district court, the litigation is not

5

"terminated."

6

hope that answers Your Honor's question.

It*s still there.

Under

And that really — I

7

But under the facts of that situation --

8

QUESTION*

9

It would seem -- the answer, it

seems to me, is that the documents should not be

10

disclosable because there is potential litigation on the

11

horizon.

12

Maybe I don't understand your answer.

Yes, Your Honor, but also sine quo

litigation, hasn't happened.

15

degree pending in a federal district court and under the

16

D.C. Circuit's rule somebody wants documents relating to

would say with respect to that, if that would be the

rule that the Court would want to fashion -- and as I

say that —

You’d be happy with that rule, but

you’d lose this case.

MR. MASON:

23
24

I

All right.

I'm

Thank you, Your

Honor.
I suspect that under your argument each side

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

could make arguments and that would be, I suggest,

2

decided on a case by case basis in the district court.

3

I’d like to point out a few other comments

4

with respect to what counsel has said.

5

standard does not go as far as other situations and

6

other arguments the Government has made.

7

States versus I BIT, in Chief Judge Ellestein's court, the

8

Government urged the rule that you should get documents,

9

work product documents, upon termination of litigation.

The D.C. Circuit

In United

10

And there are several district court opinions, albeit

11

only district court opinions, that would go farther than

12

the D.C. Circuit’s rule in FOIA.

13

I would like to make one other point.

Most of

14

the argument in the Government’s brief, at least half of

15

it, is directed to the situation of civil discovery.

16

This, Your Honor, is a FOIA case.

17

here with respect to discovery of work product in civil

18

litigation under Rule 26.

19

There is no issue

Indeed, in Merrill the court said, we are not

20

going to decide this in the discovery Rule 26 context.

21

Therefore, the Court should examine these parameters not

22

under Rule 26 but under FOIA legislative history that

23

says, as the D.C. Circuit said, disclosure at a zenith.

24

We interpret exemptions very narrowly under FOIA.

25

Government has a greater burden under FOIA.

47
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

The

1

The argument that there may be some harm in

2

civil discovery is simply not before this Court, and

3

nothing the D.C. Circuit said would indicate that this

4

particular ruling could apply in the work product rule

5

or under Rule 26.

6

Finally, I’d like to turn to the so-called

7

parade of horribles that the Government is suggesting

8

will happen if the D.C. Circuit's rule is upheld.

9

of all, they say if this rule is the case and is upheld

First

10

the Government will not amass or prepare its case.

11

Probably the best answer I could give to that is what

12

Justice White said concurring in Nobles.

13

If the purpose of the work product rule, as

14

Justice White said, is to protect the adversary process,

15

when the litigation is over and your adversary cannot

16

get those documents and use them against you, the raison

17

d’etre, if you will, of Hickman evaporates.

18

submit that that is clearly the situation in this

19

particular litigation.

20

clearly when it’s dismissed with prejudice, not even

21

having to get to the issue of related litigation, the

22

so-called advantage that Hickman versus Taylor was

23

concerned about simply, simply will not happen, because

24

the other lawyer can’t use those work product materials

25

against the Government.

Now, I

When the lawsuit is over,

48
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

The Government has other parades of

or errors in the files.

6

argument they make on appeal.

7

lour Honor, that lawyers simply do not sit around

8

writing memorandums to the files indicating that they've

9

made all kinds of mistakes.

10

The Government says Government attorneys

Well, there's nothing in the

That simply is a red

herring.

11

The Government also says that now we might

12

have to destroy our files, heaven forbid, if this rule

13

stays.

14

out. Government lawyers are very transient, and I think

15

this Court should accept the clear proposition that

16

Government lawyers are not going to destroy their files

17

because of this so-called work product privilege.

18

Well, in point of fact, as the Government points

As I believe Justice O'Connor said, the work

19

product privilege today is qualified.

20

rationale of the Government, all those fears would

21

happen right now, because it may well be that Mr.

22

Geller's work product in this case conceivably could be

23

ordered produced by a federal district judge if some

24

other conceivable party would make a showing of need.

25

Under the

of the same concern, whether it arises out of the same

I am not suggesting that this Court should

All I am suggesting is that it is a workable rule,

The best thing to do, Your Honors, I submit,

Finally, with respect to potential

only thing I am saying is that the potential related

litigation test is workable, it's been done in other

contexts.

This Court need not concern itself right now

10

with formulating a specific test because the Court of

11

Appeals said, remand this thing back to the district

12

court and the district court will determine.

13

Lastly if I may, this question about why we

14

want these documents and doesn't this relate to the

because of the so-called other case out there we have a

need for it.

should get these documents because of need or because of

anything else, because respondent recognizes under Sears

that that does not make us any greater or give us any

lesser right to obtain these documents.

We have never argued in this Court that we

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Geller?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.

12

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

13
14

MR. GELLER*

Just one or two things, Mr. Chief

Justice.

15

I want to make sure there are no

16

misunderstandings in light of respondent’s argument.

17

do take the position that under Exemption 5 documents

18

that are subject to a qualified privilege, that is that

19

are subject to the work product privilege, cannot be

20

mandatorily disclosed under the Freedom of Information

21

Act.

22

We

In other words, the word "routinely” has a

23

meaning there.

The fact that one judge in one

24

particular case may have found that a plaintiff has

25

shown the need doesn't need that that document would be

53

1

routinely disclosed.

2

to Justice White's question, Judge Fisher in the

3

Americana litigation made a finding defendant had

4

substantial need for the documents.

5

these sorts of documents would be routinely disclosed.

6

And in this very case, in response

No suggestion that

Unless qualified privileges are covered by

7

Exemption 5, as they clearly appear to be by the

8

legislative history, then Congress would have

9

effectively repealed qualified privileges such as the

10

work product privilege or the confidential commercial

11

information privilege at issue in Merrill when it passed

12

the Freedom of Information Act.

13

Congress intended to do that.

14

We can’t believe

Now, secondly. Respondent has suggested many

15

times that this is a very narrow decision, it only

16

applies in the Freedom of Information Act context.

17

it's true that the D.C. Circuit sprinkled in a few

18

places in its opinion the suggestion that this is a FOIA

19

case.

20

And

But of course, there’s no analytical support

21

for that sort of a distinction.

Exemption 5 is clearly

22

tied right to civil discovery.

23

and this Court’s opinions in Sears and Roebuck — and I

24

would refer the Court to footnote 16 in Sears and

25

Roebuck — shows that the exemption is intended to

mirror civil discovery/ and therefore the Court has to

2

consider not only the FOIA context but whether this is a

3

workable rule.

4

QUESTION*

Mr. Geller, you don't really

5

contend it mirrors civil discovery.

6

it's somewhat narrower, because of the "routinely”

7

requirement.

8
9

10

You're contending

If this was discoverable —

MR. GELLER:

Nell, it mirrors civil discovery

in terms of the extent of the privilege.

But once you

determine that there is a privilege there --

11

QUESTION-.

12

MR. GELLER*

13

QUESTION:

Right.
— then you never —
But your view is that really in

14

specific cases it's narrower, FOIA is narrower, whereas

15

the Court of Appeals took the view it was broader.

16

MR. GELLER*

Well, it's quite — it's narrower

17

in the sense that no showing of need has to be made

18

under FOIA.

19

look —

If it's privileged at all, you don’t

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. GELLER:

Right.
— to see whether there’s some

22

plaintiff somewhere who could overcome the privilege,

23

because that wouli read the privilege out of the

24

statutes in terms of Government litigation.

25

Thank you.
