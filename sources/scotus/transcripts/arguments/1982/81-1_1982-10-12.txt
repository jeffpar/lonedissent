ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. BALL, Esq.

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER, BOB JONES UNIVERSITY

8

MR. BALL*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Courts
10

I speak for the Petitioner, Bob Jones

11 University.

The university, in coming before this Court

12 today, finds itself in a remarkable position.

It

13 suffers the severe injury of loss of its tax exempt
14 status, but there exists nowhere a party in any 1981
15 proceeding or in any judicial or administrative
16 proceeding anywhere, including this very proceeding,
17 claiming to be aggrieved by any action or policy of the
18 university, including its marriage policy.
19

Furthermore, the university is not said to be

20 in violation of any law, or ever to have been in
21 violation of any law.

But if it were, it would be

22 subject to the penalties provided in that law which
23 likely would be far less injurious to the university
24 than deprivation to its entire operation by

revocation

25 of its tax exempt status.
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Again, speaking of unlawfulness, the historic

2 antagonist of this small school which has graduated tens
3 of thousands of youngsters each

decade, the government

4 of the United States itself came before this Court on
5 January 8 to confess,

6

in effect, that the IRS, in its

11-year campaign against the school, had been utterly

7 unlawful, had been without

a vestigate of authority from

8 the Congress.

Finally, not only the university but also, the

9

10 nation is faced with the broad consequences of the
11

syllogism which is the Fourth Circuit Green versus

12 Connally statutory thesis;

namely, there is a major

13 premise that organizations which violate federal public
14 policy cannot be

tax exempt.

The minor premise is that

15 racial non-discrimination represents federal public
16 policy,

and the conclusion is that a racially

17 discriminatory organization cannot be tax exempt.

While Bob Jones University is not a racially

18

19 discriminatory organization, there's obviously no end of

20 the federal public policies which can be substituted for
21

racial non-discrimination in the minor premise.

Sex

22 non-discrimination, age non-discrimination, religious
23 non-discrimination,
24 on

environmental purity, and you can go

with federal act after federal act which states a

25 federal public policy.

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Now, if this Court accepts the Greer* Fourth

2 Amendment thesis, it, at the same time, brings aboard
3 problems of immense magnitude.

The problem already

4 indicated of selecting and defining a federal public
5 policy or of choosing which among federal public
6 policies must be conformed with as the price of tax
7 exempt status, and who the definers will be.

And the

8 interesting question of what the effective date of that
9 policy will be, with all the consequences that entails.
10

And inherent in all of that the notion that

11 taxation, which is so intimately related to the lives
12 and liberties of citizens, will not necessarily be
13 determined by any act of Congress or by the
14 Constitution, but instead, by a baroque super-law; the
15 super-law of federal public policy invoked by
16 administrators or judges and not the deliberate and
17 finite act of the elected representatives of the people.
18

As Judge Leventhal said in his opinion in

19 Green, that very elaborate opinion, he said, the
20 ultimate criterion is federal public policy.
21

Now, the tax exempt status of Bob Jones

22 University, a pervasively religious ministry which in
23 purpose and character and discipline is a zealous faith
24 community which would not exist except for its religious
25 goals, has been conditioned upon a requirement that it
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 abandon a religious practice, its marriage policy, which
2 in conscience and fidelity it cannot abandon.
3

Bob Jones University’s theology may not be

4 yours; it certainly is not mine.

But its theology,

5 nevertheless, is rooted, as the record very well shows
6 — and I would point especially to two things in the
7 Joint Appendix; namely, page A-66 in which there is
8 testimony as to why it is that all of the policies
9 followed by the university are obligatory upon the
10 university as dictated by Scripture.
11

For example, I’m sure the Court has noted a

12 policy with respect to male-female relationships in the
13 university which is certainly an unusual policy,
14 probably unique in this country.

But it is followed in

15 the face of much opinion to the contrary and probably a
16 general custom to the contrary in this country.

It is

17 followed and carried out zealously because it is
18 believed to be dictated in Scripture.
19

The policy with respect to inter-marriage the

20 record also clearly establishes was rooted from the
21 beginning in a belief that is derived from Scripture;
22 not that races should not associate, but that races
23 should not inter-marry.
24

This concept is not something that was

25 invented by the university in response to the
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 desegregation orders of this Court.

It existed, for

2 example, in 1960, long before there was any threat by
3 the IPS, as is shown in the statement of the university
4 contained in a radio address appearing in the record, as
5 Plaintiff's Exhibit 1 at A-95.

Furthermore, it was very

6 clearly established in the record that this policy and
7 practice and this belief go back to 1927, a half century
8 ago, at the time of the college's founding.
9

Now, revocation of its tax exempt status

10 constitutes very serious injury to my client of
11 precisely the kind that was described by Justice Powell
12 eight years ago in Bob Jones University versus Simon,
13 and it’s no answer to say — to put up the strawman of
14 saying that Bob Jones University is free to follow out
15 its policy when the price of doing that is loss of its
16 tax exemption.
17

I want to say that no particular religious

18 practice — for example, praying — is being curtailed
19 by the IRS.

Of course it is not.

20 religious enterprise.
21 whole ministry.

It's the entire

It's the religious organism, the

A bundle of religious manifestations

22 which is threatened, hurt, by the IRS policy.
23

Beyond this harm immediate and after a long

24 decade, to quite an extent now irreparable even though
25 relief would be given today, lie those threats to the
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

religious liberty of everyone if those principles were

2 to be affirmed by this Court which have been stated by
3

the court of appeals in this case.

4
5

First, that all religious organizations,
including all churches, are, by not being taxed, being

6 subsidized.
7

Secondly, that if a sincerely-held

religious belief which if practices poses no threat to

8 public health, safety or morals, nevertheless runs
9

counter to a national consensus of some kind, the

10

religious body professing that belief must be taxed, and

11

on that account.

12

government may not penalize or discriminate against

13

individuals or groups because they hold religious views

14

abhorrent to the authorities.

Whereas this Court said in Sherbert,

Fourthly, that religious institutions must

conform their practices — that's the expression of

25

their beliefs — to what the Fourth Circuit called, and

1

I quote, "fundamental societal values achieved by means

2 of a uniform policy”.

Whereas, this Court has said in

3 the memorable language of Justices Jackson and Barnett,
4 if there's any fixed star in our constitutional
5 constellation, it is that no official, high or petty,
6 can prescribe what shall be orthodox in religion,

7 politics, nationalism or other matters of opinion.
8 Compulsory unification of opinion, this Court said,

9 achieves only the unity of the graveyard.
10
11

Kay it please the Court, I have asked the
Marshal to reserve me two minutes for rebuttal.

If

12 there are no questions, I thank the Court.

13

QOESTIONs

Mr. Ball, I have a question.

Would

14 you concede that Congress could authorize or could
15 provide that no exemption would be granted?
16

MB. BALL*

Yes, I certainly would concede that.

17

QUESTIONS

How do you respond to the argument

18 that I understand was made, that in 1976, in effect.
19 Congress indicated its action when it dealt specifically
20 with the subject of discrimination in social clubs and
21 cited in the reports in the House and Senate the Green
22 decision in some manner that would indicate

23 congressional adoption, if you will, of the position
24 taken in the Green case.
25

MB. BALL*

I read that as a very unclear

1

affirmation by the Congress.

I don't think it amounts

2 to that
3

I think, furthermore/ that the evidences of

4

other views of Congress are very clearly to be found.

5

In fact, very recently in amendments to the Tuition Tax

6 Credit bill, it was very clearly indicated that the
7

Congress was awaiting this Court's decision in this case

8 with respect to whether or not Congress had the powers
9
10
11

that some had claimed it did have.
The Congress itself has been in a state of
considerable controversy and excitement over the — ever

12 since January 8th.

It’s plain to me, and I think Mr.

13

McNairy will develop this at greater length, that the

14

Congress could, at any point, coming back to your first

15

question, express itself as it will.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM G. McNAIRI, Esq.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER, GOLDSBORO CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS

5

MR. McNAIRYt

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

6 please the Court:
7

The issue that I will address is whether under

8 the current provisions of Section 501(c)(3) a private
9 church-related school can be denied tax exempt status
10 because it maintains a racially discriminatory
11 admissions policy as a matter of its religious
12 conviction.
13

The exemptions from taxation now contained in

14 Section 501(c)(3) originated as a part of the Tariff Act
15 of 1894.

That legislation exempted from taxation

16 corporations which were organized for charitable,
17 religious and educational purposes.
18

Since the ratification of the 16th Amendment

19 in 1913, the tax exemption provisions of our revenue
20 laws have been expanded from time to time by Congress to
21 include additional categories of organizations.

For

22 example, in 1913 Congress added scientific organizations
23 to the list.

Additional categories of organizations

24 were added in 1918, then again in 1921, then in 1954,
25 and most recently, in 1976 Congress amended Section
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

501(c)(3) to provide that organizations which are

2 organized for the purpose of fostering national or
3 international sports competition shall be exempt from
4 taxation.

Section 501(c)(3) now describes eight distinct

5

6 categories of organizations which shall be exempt from
7 taxation.

Each of which are connected by the

8 disjunctive "or".

By use of the word "or" all of

9 available legislative history indicates that Congress
10 intended for each term used in Section 501(c)(3) to have
11

a separate and distinct meaning.

All available

12 legislative history also indicates that Congress
13 intended for each purpose enumerated in Section
14 501(c)(3)

to constitute a separata and independent basis

15 for qualification for tax exempt status under Section
16 501(c)(3).
17

Mow at the same time that Congress was

18 expanding the list

of the categories of organizations

19 which were exempt from taxation.

Congress also, from

20 time to time, added additional restrictions that were
21 required to be satisfied.

For example, in 1913 Congress

22 added the requirement that no part of the net earnings
23 of an exempt organization could inure to
24 any
25

the benefit of

private shareholder or individual.
And then in 1934, Congress imposed additional
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

restrictions on the political and lobbying activities of

2 exempt organizations.
3 of Section 501(c)(3)

So when the legislative history
is viewed in its entirety, it is

4 clear that over the years Congress has developed its own
5 definition

of the categories or types of organizations

6 that shall be exempt from taxation, which can be
7 universally applied

without reference to the common law

8 of the various states.

There is simply no evidence in the legislative

9

10 history of Section 501(c)(3) that Congress intended to
11

use the word "charitable** in its broad commonlaw sense.

12 Nor is there any evidence in the legislative history of
13 Section 501(c)(3)

that Congress intended that an

14 educational organization must,

in addition, qualify as a

15 commonlaw charity in order to qualify for tax exempt
16 status.
17

Now consistent with the plain language of the

18 statute, the Internal Revenue Service routinely granted
19 tax exempt status to private educational institutions

20 for 57 years,

without regard to the admissions policies

21 of those institutions.

Then on July 10, 1970, without

22 any direction from the Congress whatsoever, the IRS
23 announced in

a press release that it would no longer

24 grant tax exempt status to private schools that
25 maintained a racially discriminatory admissions policy.

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTIONS

During those 50-some years that you

2 say the exemption was routinely granted, how many
3

revisions or amendments were undertaken to the exemption

4

section?

5

MR, McNAIRYs

6

QUESTION#

7

MR. McNAIRYs

Well, Your Honor, in —

It was frequent, I suppose.
It was frequent.

There were

8 amendments -- the 1894 statute was held to be
9

unconstitutional in the Pollock case.

Then after

10

ratification of the 16th Amendment, scientific

11

corporations were added in 1913, additional categories

12

of organizations were added in 1918, then again in 1921,

13

then again in 1954 —

14
15
16

QUESTION;

But did the section always read

charitable or education?
MR. McNAIRYs

Always real from the very

17

beginning charitable, religious or education.

18

always that disjunctive "or" from the vary beginning.

19

QUESTION:

There was

Was that the first time that the

20 Internal Revenue Service had ever announced a change in
21

22

position without explicit action from the Congress?
MR. McNAIRYs

No, sir. Your Honor.

Prior to

23

1965, the Internal Revenue Service routinely granted tax

24

exempt status to organizations without regard to their

25

admissions policy.

Then from 1965 to 1967, the Internal
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2346

1 Revenue Service maintained a freeze on the granting of
2 any further tax exempt status to schools that had
3 discriminatory admissions policies.

Then from 1967 to

4 1970, the IRS granted tax exempt status to private
5 schools that had racially discriminatory admissions
6 policies so long as they did not receive any
7 unconstitutional state aid.

And then in 1970 in the

8 press release which I just referred to, they announced
9 the policy which remained in effect until the current
10 administration reversed that policy in these cases.
11

Now, the Internal Revenue Service is simply an

12 administrative agency in the Executive Branch of
13 government.
14

QUESTION*

Could I ask you — I’m not sure I

15 got it from your brief.

Suppose the Internal Revenue

16 Service had, from the outset, construed the statute the
17 way it began to do in 1970.

Do you think that would

18 have been contrary to the plain language of the statute,
19 I take it?

20

HR. McNAIRY*

Not only contrary to the plain

21 language of —
22

QUESTION*

23

MR. WcNAIRYs

24 reason.

And to the intent of* Congress?
Yes, sir, I do, for this

There’s absolutely no evidence in the

25 legislative history of Section 501(c)(3) that Congress
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-234S

1

intended to grant the broad discretion to the

2 Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service to grant or
3 deny tax exempt status to organizations based on the
4 Commissioner's determination of whether an organization
5 complies with federal public policies.
6

These are political questions that have been

7 allocated to the Congress.

Any change in the

8 requirements that an organization must satisfy in order
9 to qualify for tax exempt status must come from Congress.
10

QUESTIONS

Of course, your argument is fully

11 made if you say that the plain language of the statute
12 would foreclose that kind of discretion.

But I take it

13 you're arguing also that even if the plain language
14 doesn't, that the Commissioner nevertheless doesn't have
15 that kind of discretion.
16

NR. McNAIRYs

The Commissioner does not have

17 the power to make those decisions, and the one clear
18 precedent that we have for that is that in the 1950s,
19 Congress amended or incorporated a provision into the

20 Internal Security Act of 1950 to deny tax exempt status
21 to certain Communist organizations on the grounds of
22 federal public policy.
23

So there. Congress had determined that as a

24 matter of public policy, even though an organization may
25 be educational, that it should be denied tax exempt
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-234S

’ted Page

1 status.
2

Under Article I of the Constitution, these

3 decisions are to be made by Congress.

If Congress

4 should decide that as a matter of public policy schools
5 that maintain racially discriminatory admissions
6 policies should no longer be granted tax exempt status,
7 then Congress should amend the statute, just as they did
8 in the case of Communist organizations in the 1950s.
9

And finally, Your Honor, I would like to point

10 out, as the Chief Justice said just last term in his
11 dissenting opinion in Plyler versus Doe that it is not
12 up to this Court to fashion a remedy for what may be
13 perceived to be the shortcomings of Congress.

And this

14 principle applies with particular force in tax matters.
15 As Justice Powell said in the Byron case, when matters
16 of taxation require re-examination, Congress and not the
17 courts should define precisely the conduct —
18

QUESTION*

Mr. McNairy, I thought in your

19 reply brief you had acknowledged that if the primary
20 purpose of the school were contrary to public policy, such
21 as Fagans's School for Pickpockets that you referred to, that
22 that would be a — the IRS would have the discretion to deny
23 exemption then.
24

MR. McNAIRY:

The operation of — ho, sir,

25 Your Honor, I did not intend to convey that impression
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 at all.
2

The
QUESTION;

Hell/, there was emphasis in I think

3 it was your brief on the difference between the primary
4 purpose of the institution and just an ancillary policy
5 within the institution.
6

MR. McNAIRYs

That is true.

The purpose of

7 Goldsboro Christian Schools is to conduct an educational
8 institution —
9

QUESTION;

I understand that, but what I’m

10 asking is did you not agree that if the primary purpose
11 were contrary to federal policy, that IRS would have
12 discretion to deny the exemption?

I thought you had

13 conceded that in your reply brief.
14

HR. McNAIRYs

The Fagan School for

18

QUESTION:

Now, why is that obvious?

19

MR. McNAIRYs

The statute says that an

20 organization must be organized and operated exclusively
21 for educational purposes.
22

QUESTION:

Right.

23

MR. McNAIRYs

Hell, why isn’t Fagan —

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BRADFORD REYNOLDS, Esq.

10

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

11

MR. REYNOLDS*

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

12 please the Court*
13

The United States government has no tolerance

14 for racial discrimination in the field of education.
15 Both public and private.

And we who are charged with

16 the responsibility of enforcing the law, including the
17 laws that are handed down by this Court, are
18 unflaggingly committed to the elimination from school
19 systems throughout this country of all vestiges of
20 discriminatory treatment on account of race.
21

These cases do not in any respect call into

22 question that commitment.

They raise instead, in a

23 context that all too readily brings to mind that
24 overworked adage "hard cases make bad law", a simple
25 question of statutory construction with regard to a
21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

T single provision of the Internal Revenue Code; namely,
2 Section 501(c)(3).
3

And that question of statutory construction

4 turns on whether Congress in 1913 when it originally
5 enacted that provision, whether Congress intended the
6 word "charitable” to have its commonlaw sense that would
7 embrace all of the other purposes set forth in the
8 statute, and would call upon the — or I guess I should
9 say — would delegate to the IRS the authority to grant
10 or deny exemptions based on the IRS's independent
11 determination as to whether the organization in question
12 was organized for a purpose beneficial to the community,
13 and in addition, whether it was pursuing any practices
14 that contravened law or public policy.
15

And in the sense of that phrase, under the

16 commonlaw we don’t mean — we can’t be confined simply
17 to federal law and federal public policy; that commonlaw
18 sense of the phrase would embrace state laws and state
19 public policies as well.
20

The question was whether that was the intent

21 of the original Congress.

In the courts below, and

22 initially in this Court, the government took the
23 position that Section 501(c)(3) authorized the IRS to
24 deny tax exempt status to Bob Jones University and
25 Goldsboro Christian Schools, notwithstanding that they
72

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 concedelly qualified under the literal terms of the Code
2 provisions as educational or religious organizations.
3

That position was based on a reading of the

4 statute by the IR3 at that time, similar to the analysis
5 set forth, in Mr. Coleman’s brief, that assigned to the
6 enacting Congress in 1913 an intention to afford tax
7 exempt status to all organizations found by the IBS to
8 be charitable in the broad comraonlav sense.

That is, in

9 the sense of being beneficial to the community and
10 acting in conformance with law and public policy, but
11 not to be available to those organizations that did not
12 meet that commonlaw definition.
13

Bob Jonas and Goldsboro failed that commonlaw

14 standard since their adherence to racially
15 discriminatory practices as to their students, even if
16 rooted in sincere religious beliefs unquestionably runs
17 afoul of national civil rights policy.
18
19 mind?

Why, then, did the government have a change of
Why, in full recognition of these schools’ openly

20 discriminatory practices, did we suddenly take the
21 position that tax exemptions should be granted?
22

The answer to that is straightforward.

We

23 looked at the language of Section 501(c)(3) and found no
24 support in the plain terms of the provision for the
25 proposition that charitable was used by the 1913
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Congress in its broad, comraonlaw sense as encompassing
2 all the other purposes.

To the contrary, that language

3 clearly reflects that each enumerated exempt purpose was
4 intended to have an independent legal significance.
5

We examined the intent of the enacting

6 Congress in

1913, and we found no indication that it

7 intended to delegate broad, unfettered authority to the
8 Commissioner of Internal Revenue to grant or deny exempt
9 status based on his independent notions of national
10 public policy.
11

Indeed, all indications from the legislative

12 history are that a narrower understanding of charity was
13 contemplated.
14 the poor.

That is the understanding of relief to

And in that regard, I would direct the Court

15 to our Reply Brief and point out specifically that in
16 1913, at the time that the original enacting Congress
17 enacting this legislation, there was introduced an
18 amendment that would add to the language of the statute
19 "benevolent" organizations as well as "charitable."

20 That amendment also added to the statute "scientific" as
21 another discrete purpose.
22

The amendment that sought to add — by

23 Representative Rogers — that sought to add "benevolent"
24 was introduced because it was viewed that "charitable"
25 was not a broad enough term to cover those organizations
24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON. O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that had a benevolent purpose.

The Congress voted down

2 that amendment and at the same time# agreed to add
3 "scientific" as a separate, discrete purpose within the
4 statute.
5

In addition, that same Congress, as we point

6 out in our Reply Brief, that same Congress passed
7 501(c)(4).

501(c)(4) would grant exemptions to

8 organizations that were organized for the purpose of
9 promoting general welfare.

That, as the legislative

10 history points out clearly, says 501(c)(4) was
11 introduced because it was felt that the 501(c)(3)
12 exemption was not broad enough to cover organizations
13 that were organized for promotion of general welfare.
14 It was specifically because the 501(c)(3) provision was
15 deemed to be narrow that Congress — it was introduced;
16 that 501(c)(4) was introduced in the 1913 Congress and
17 was made part of the law at that time.
18

In addition, in the 1913 Congress, the

19 provision that was enacted included a proviso that said
20 that the exemption would not be available to any of the
21 enumerated organizations if their profits were inuring
22 to private benefit.

That particular proviso would not

23 be necessary if the commonlaw concept of charity
24 pertained, because under common law, you could not be a

25 charitable organization if, indeed, you had any of your
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

revenues going to private — inuring to private

2 individuals.
3

So, in that original Congress the legislative

4

history underscores and reinforces a narrow

5

interpretation of the statute.

In 1918, when Congress

6 again revisited 501(c)(3), there was a specific
7

amendment to add another purpose.

That purpose was

8 prevention of cruelty to children and animals.
9

If

Congress had viewed "charitable" in its broad, commonlaw

10

sense, there would have been no need to add another

11

purpose which would have been a near redundancy onto the

12

statute.

13

purpose.

14

But in 1918, Congress specifically added that

In 1921 it again amended the statute and added

15

"literary.”

16

sense but not at all a redundancy if the narrow concept

17

of charity was what Congress had in mind.

18
19

Again, a redundancy under the commonlaw

In 1923, the IRS issued an intepretation of
this provision which said very clearly that the

20 interpretation that the IRS assigned to the statute was
21

that charity had the meaning of relief to the poor; the

22 narrower meaning and not the broad commonlaw meaning.
23

Congress in 1924 was made aware of that

24

particular interpretation by Senator Willis who, on the

25

floor of the Senate, introduced an amendment to have the
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 statute change that interpretation and add onto the
2 statute the broad commonlaw definition of "charity” with
3 specific reference to that narrow interpretation that
4 the IRS had issued.

In 1924 the Senate voted down that

5 amendment to expand the meaning of "charitable" and
6 apply a commonlaw definition to the statute.
7

Following that activity in 1924, the statute

8 was re-enacted in 1926 and 28 and 32* the regulations
9 were re-issued and Congress at no time changed what it
10 had put in place.

And then we had another amendment in

11 1934 where Congress added yet another amendment to the
12 statute saying that if you were engaged in lobbying
13 activities, this was not the — the exemption .was not
14 available; that the commonlaw definition had been what
15 Congress intended, and that particular amendment was
16 unnecessary because in common law you could not be a
17 charitable institution and engage in lobbying activities.
18

And then in 1936 and 38 the statute was

19 re-enacted, and in 1954 Congress added another purpose,
«

20 which was testing for public safety again, a redundancy
21 under the commonlaw definition, but if the understanding
22 was a narrow intepretation then there clearly was
23 another purpose to be added.
24

We reviewed this legislation history and could

25 find nothing in the legislative history to sustain the
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

proposition that the broad, expansive understanding of

2 "charitable" was what Congress had in mind.

The

3

administrative interpretations consistently, from 1913

4

through 1954, stated in specific terms the narrow

5

understanding that the IRS had of the provision as

6 pertaining to relief to the poor for charitable

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Very well.

Mr. Coleman?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM T. COLEMAN, JR., Esq

4

AS AMICUS CURIAE

5

MR. COLEMAN:

Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice,

6 may it please the Court:
7

The basic issue here is whether Sections

8 501(c)(3) and 170 — because 170 is very much here, of
9 the Code — authorize recognition of tax benefits for
10 racially discriminatory educational institutions which
11 teach secular subjects.
If Congress so intended, there is a serious

12

13 Fifth Amendment question.

If Congress did not so

14 intend, petitioners contend that the First Amendment
15 nevertheless requires that tax benefits be afforded to
16 schools whose racial policies are motivated by religious
17 belief, even though all other racially discriminatory
18 schools, including church-related schools, are denied
19 such benefit.
20

There are just a few facts I'd like to

21 emphasize.

First, these petitioners are private schools

22 who provide state-certified education in secular
23 subjects for children from kindergarten through high
24 school.

By doing that and going to that school, a child

25 satisfies the compulsory attendance law of each of the
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 States.

Bob Jones also provides certain university

2 training, most of which is secular.
3

Now Golisboro concedes it's an educational

4 institution, but by the time that Bob Jones filed his
5 Reply Brief at the end it said it is exclusively "a
6 religious ministry.”

This certainly is contrary to the

7 finding of fact of the district court; it's also
8 contrary to what Bob Jones told this Court when it was
9 before it in 1974.
10

Finally on this point, when you look at the

11 record in the Simon case, the 1974 case. Hr. Justice
12 Powell, you will recall that the tax exemption which Bob
13 Jones seeks to have restored was granted to it as an
14 exclusively educational institution.
15

I don't think there's any question here that

16 each one of these institutions do exclude Black or take
17 other actions with respect to Black which would be in
18 violation of earlier cases.
19

Now petitioner's base their racial admissions

20 practices on their belief that God commands racial
21 segregation and that the Scriptures forbid interracial
22 marriage and dating.

The Joint Appendix in Goldsboro at

23 page 44 and 41 describes these religious precepts as
24 including a belief that Blacks, being descendents of
25 Ham, "were not especially blessed.”

This indicates that

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

their prosperity as a race would come as a result of

2 their drawing upon the spiritual leadership of the
3

Semites and the political leadership of the whites.
If you read the Bob Jones Appendix on page 68

4
5

and 69/ you will see similar expressions.
These cases involve the meaning of the tax

6
7

cole; whether the interpretation of this language by the

8 Internal Revenue Service as determined by Commissioner
9

Randolph W. Thor in 1970 is correct.

In evaluating the

10

statutory language, however, this Court cannot fairly

11

write on a clean slate, or even on the slate as it

12

existed in 1970.

13

Congress has acted.

14

specifically taken into account and approved this

15

Court's affirmance on December 20, 1971 in court of the

16

three-judge court construction of Sections 501(c)(3) and

17

Section 170, which was made in Green versus Connally.

18

And I'd just like to call your attention to

19

For in the intervening years,
In the process, Congress has

20 interpretation of these very words of this statute.

21

In

22 fact, in the next ten years there have been more
23

hearings on this issue than perhaps any other issue in

24

Congress.

25

Congress made no change.
In 1976, Congress amended this precise section
34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to add "amateur sports."

Once again, it made no change

2 with respect to the interpretation which you had placed
3 on these words.

Eleven bills were introduced to try to

4 change youc interpretation.

None even got out of the

5 committee.
6

When Congress was informed of this Court’s

7 decision in Simon, Congress did amend the Code to
8 overturn your decision with respect to the procedural
9 aspects of that case.

But once again, it, in no way,

10 even though it read your opinion and read the fact that
11 you had indicated how this section had been interpreted,
12 it made no actions to overturn that.
13

And, Justice O’Connor, I think you put your

14 finger on it.

I think that the most dramatic example —

15 and it seems to me that thereafter no one who reads its
16 history can say that Congress has not ratified this
17 interpretation.

In 1976, Congress looked at a decision

18 called McGlotten versus Connally which had been decided
19 by three judges in the district court here.

That court

20 had construed subsection (7) of the same 501(c) to
21 permit tax exempt, private and social clubs to
22 discriminate racially.
23

That court also had held that subsection (8)

24 did not allow tax exemptions and tax deductibility for
25 racially discriminatory fraternal lodges.
35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Congress then added subsection (1) to 501 to

2 deny tax exempt status to any social club which
3 discriminated "against any person on the basis of race,
4 color or religion."

This subsection was adopted

5 expressly to overruled HcGlotten insofar that it
6 recognized tax exempt status for segregated social
7 schools.
8

No congressional action was taken with respect

9 to the tax exempt fraternal lodges since the court had
10 already determined that the language covered that and
11 prohibited discrimination.
12

What we see, therefore, and when you look at

13 the legislative history — and it really should strike
14 you as being very dramatic — that in those instances
15 where the court had held that you could gat the tax
16 exemption and still segregate, Congress changed that.
17 When you had held in Simon that the person could not
18 proceed by injunction to review the revocation, Congress
19 changed that.

No, I'm just saying —

In order to deny the exemption to

MR. COLEMAN;

No, sir.

I think that the

language as written does that already, and you so held.

17

And I'm saying that once you so held, and thereafter,

18

it's called to the attention of the Congress and

19

Congress takes all those actions and doesn't change it,

20 unless you're going to reverse the Haig case you have to
21

say here that that, once again, goes to the fact that at

22 this stage, that's what the statute means.
23

Now, could I turn to the statute itself?

Our

24

position is that with respect to Section 501(c)(3), that

25

Congress intended to enact a provision which said that

1 with respect to those charities which were charities of
2 common law, we’re going to give this tax benefit.
3

For example,

the Act of 1894 is mentioned,

4 which exempted religious» educational and charitable
5 institutions.

That Act did not have a word in it which

6 said that the organization had to be one where no
7 individual got the profits.

1

Nevertheless, because that is true at common

2 law, the IRS interpreted that provision to mean that of
3 course if you’ve got profits.

4

With respect to the amendment dealing with

5 propaganda, before that was amended and the IRS and
5 Learned Hand in the Second Circuit had a case.

He held

7 that because at common law a charity could not engage in
8 propaganda, that it was clear that you couldn't engage
9 in propaganda.

Thereafter, Congress amended the statute

10 to bring it in line and recognize that decision.

11

The same thing is true with respect to

12 legislation.

Root demonstrated that with legislation,

13 if Congress had prior to that being in the law, the IRS
14 and the courts would say that if you were -- if you were
15 listed in Section 501(3)(c), you couldn’t get the
18 exemption if you engaged in that type of activity.

We

17 say that another concommitant of common law charity is,
18 you can't engage in illegal acts.
19

QUESTION*

Mr. Coleman, your opponents say

20 that if your interpretation of charitable is correct,
21 all those amendments were simply redundant.

Do you

22 agree with that?
23

MR. COLEMAN*

Well, I think — I think that

24 some of them were, ani I think when you restudy the
25 legislative here, Mr. Justice White, what you will find

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

2 statute, that the IRS and the courts by decisions had
3 said they were already there.
4

QUESTION;

Well, surely you don't take issue

5 with the fact that the IRS construed the statute in a
6 different way for a good many years prior to 1960.
7

MR. COLEMAN;

No.

I would say that from the

9 time the IRS —
g
10

QUESTION;

They were just wrong.

MR. COLEMAN;

No.

The IRS has always

11 construed the statute the same way, Your Honor.

The

12 construction that they have always made is that in
13 addition to being one of the original three and now
14 seven items listed in Section 501(c)(3), that you also
15 have to have the overall aura of being charitable.
16

QUESTION;

As I understood Mr. Reynolds, he

17 said that the government changed its mind.

MR. COLEMAN;

Well, he is wrong.

He is just

QUESTIONS

Public policy.

3

MR. COLEMANs

The only thing that has changed,

4 and that was certainly what it did in 1924.
5 what it did since then.

That is

In 1959, they actually enacted

6 a regulation which gave a broader meaning, but the only

7 thing that has changed is that this Court in 1954 and
8 then followed by Jones and Runyon, even though I think

9 they should have done it in 1871, didn't get around to
10 doing it until
11

1954 and 1974.

change in the statute.

12

QUESTIONS

So there has been no

The statute has always said —

There has been a change in the

13 IRS's construction of it.
14

MR. COLEMANs

15

QUESTIONS

16

MR. COLEMANs

17 again. Your Honor.

No, no.

How about the application of it?
Hall, no, sir.

I will try once

The statute has always said that if

18 you are an institution in Section 501(c)(3), and you
19 want to get the tax exemption, you have to be
20 "charitable.”

You couldn't pay money to private

21 people.
22

QUESTIONS

Mr. Coleman, what you are saying,

23 if I understand you, is that there has been a change in
24 national policy.
25

MR. COLEMANs

A change in national policy, and

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 therefore that's the only change, but that doesn't
2 change the meaning of the statuate.

The statute has

3 always meant the same thing, that any time there is a
4 violation of national — take, for example, with respect
5 to religion.

Certainly, do you mean to tell me that if

6 a religious belief sincerely held was that each year you
7 had to sacrifice 10 percent of the members of the
8 church, that this IRS would continue to say and this
9 Department of Justice would continue to say that you
10 have to give the tax exemption?
11

There is nothing in the statute which says

12 that if a religion believes in sacrifice, you give it a
13 tax

exemption.

The simple reason is that even a

14 religious body at common law has certain things it was

15 illegal to do.

If it did one of those illegal things,

15 then it would not be entitled to the tax exemption.
17

Sow, with respect — and therefore our

10 argument depends upon whether you read the word
19 "charitable" — again, whether you read the word
20 “charitable" narrowly as relief for the poor, or
21 broadly.

We think that if you are going to read it

22 narrowly, there are a lot of cases where the IRS has
23 granted the tax benefit that will now have to be
24 changed.

Preservations for the park, preservations for

25 the blood banks, the hospitals.

You can’t get that

43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

under charity if read as limited to charity for the

2 poor.

It has to have a broader meaning.
We also think — and the Department of

3

4 Treasury in its testimony in

'82 made that clear, that

5 we have been given charitable gifts, for example, to

6 keep public buildings in repair.

Clearly under this

7 narrow restriction you couldn’t do that, and the chief

8 counsel of IRS asked Hr. Reynolds, how do we rationalize
9 this?

There is nothing said about that.
So what we say. Your Honor, on the

10
11

interpretation, that from the time these words were put

12 in the statute, where they came from, it was clear that
13 even though you mentioned that you had to live up to the
14 basic common law rules of a charity, and that has always
15 been clear,
16 1894

the only change here is something which in

was felt not to be in violation of basic law, now

17 is determined to be in violation of law.
18

What law does it violate?
It violates Section 1 of the Act

It violates the Thirteenth Amendment, for

21 starters.
22

QUESTION*

Has that been held?

23

MR. COLEMANS

24

QUESTION*

25

MR. COLEMAN*

What?

Has that been held by this Court?
Well, I — yes, even you in your

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

opinion which you — in the Operating Engineers, you

2 finally held, you finally recognized even though you
3

dissented before that the Section 1 of the Act of 1866

4

made illegal racial discrimination even among two

5

private persons.

So I think the only person that yet

6 hasn't held that, because you, Justice O'Connor, in your
7

concurring opinion in the same case, accepted the same

8 interpretation, is Mr. Justice White, and I hope now
9
10

that under the rule that even though he states the
statute doesn't mean that, since at least five or six

11 cases which say that's what it means, that you finally
12

will follow your other rule, which says that ultimately

you accept the interpretations of Congress —

16

MR. COLEMAN:

17

QUESTION*

18

What other statute?

19

You

Yes.

You might go ahead beyond that.

MR. COLEMAN*

Well, I think it violates the

20 Thirteenth Amendment.
21

QUESTION*

Any other statute?

22

MR. COLEMAN:

Well, it may violate Section 6

23

of the Civil Rights Act, but I think it is clear here

24

that the action is taken, and when you look at the

25

corporate minutes of Bob Jones, you will find that it so

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

2

concedes
I would now like to turn to the -- well, the

3

other point on the statutory, I really think that the

4

government has been less than responsible in not talking

5

about Section 170, because Section 170 is clearly here.

6 If you look at the petition for cert of Bob Jones, Page
7

1, Footnote 1, you will see that also here is the

8 reversal of the injunction which had been issued against
9

the IRS, and once you turn to Section 170, I think, Mr.

10

Justice Stevens, you put your finger on it, that that

11

clearly defines charitable in the manner we say,

12

includes educational, religious, and charitable

13

institutions.

14

In fact, the term "charitable" is used

15

throughout the Code as an overall generic term that

16

embraces the seven types of institutions listed in

17

Subsection 3.

QUESTION:

Do you happen to know, Mr. Coleman,

whether the school grants scholarships, free tuition?

22 the record.
23
24
25

QUESTIONS

Is that a matter of which the Court

could take judicial notice?
MR. COLEMANs

I am pretty sure that I would

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC,

1

rely upon my fellow Pennsylvanian, Mr. Ball, and

2 whatever he tells you on that issue I would accept.
3

(General laughter.)

4

MR. COLEMANi

Indeed, for Congress to omit tax

5 benefits to racially discriminatory schools would
6 violate the Fifth Amendment.

The tax benefits involved

7 here undoubtedly provide major financial aid to support
8 petitioner’s discriminatory practices.

The exemption

9 from social security and unemployment taxes yield a tax
0 benefit of $490,000 to Bob Jones for the years

11 through 1975.
2 Simon case,

1971

Ani in Bob Jonas' sworn affidavit in the

it claimed that the income tax savings to

3 Bob Jones and the tax loss to the government would be
4 one half to three quarters of a million dollars per
5 year.

This is just under Section 501(c)(3).

6

In

7 addition, the effect of Section 70 is to make a matching
8 grant from the federal treasury to the donee's
9 charitable institution, an institution marked government
20 approved by inclusion on the government's cumulative
2

list.

Tax credits and tax deductions stand on the same

22 constitutional footing as direct grants to the
23 institution.

Mr. Justice Powell, you so held in

24 Nycriss, and the beloved Justice Harlen concurring in
25 Wall so held.

47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Petitioners and the government seek to avoid

2 these decisions by citing First Amendment cases dealing

3 with government assistance to religiously related
4 schools, but every form of government assistance to
5 religiously related school that has survived a First
6 Amendment claim has bean disapproved when provided to a

7 racially segregated school, and we collect those caces
8 on Page 60 of our brief.

9

Even the members of this Court who in dissent

10 have supported limited governmental neutral assistance
11

for religious schools have made it crystal clear that

12 they would disapprove identical assistance if the school

13 excluded pupils on the basis of race.

As you will

14 recall in Lemon, Mr. Chief Justice, you indicated that
15 you, Mr. Justice White, and Mr. Rehnquist, had this
16 view, and again, it is referred to in your Footnote 5 in
17 the Norwood case.
18

As the Court unanimously held in Norwood, the

19 Constitution places no value on private racial
20 discrimination, and accords it no protection.
21

Now, Petitioner's First Amendment argument is

22 really this.

Because racism is religiously based, they

23 have a right to tax benefits denied to all other private
24 schools, even religious ones, which cannot defend their
25 racial practices on religious grounds.

Where specific

48

AIDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

action, however, is repugnant to fundamental national

2 law and policy, a defense that it is done because of
3
4
5

religious belief, however sincere, is not available.
QUESTIONS

Hr. Coleman, I assume you would

make the same argument that a tax exemption would not be

6 available to a church which discriminated in its
7

membership on the basis of race.

8

MR. COLEMANs

9

That is a different question,

and I think you put your finger on what would point up

10

the distinction I have been trying to make.

A church

11

from the time it got the exemption had to be charitable

12

at common law, but the rules as to what a church does

13

which is legal or not legal are different from what a

14

school does which is legal or not legal.

15

know, there is no decision of this Court which says that

16

if the Catholic Church would want to limit its members

17

to Catholic, or would say that we would not — or any

18

other church would say, we will not have black members,

19

that that violates the Constitution, or it violates any

As far as I

20 federal statute.
21

But by the same token, you said that a private

22 school that wishes to do the same thing, that that
23

clearly violates the law and also it violates the

24

Thirteenth Amendment, and therefore it couldn’t do it,

25

and so that is what we are saying, that what is the

49

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

concept in the statute which has been there from the

2 very beginning is that you have to be charitable at
3 common law and not violate the types of law which the
4 nation has visited upon your type of institution.

The

5 law is different, and that is the reason why it said
6 that with the church,

that if instead of keeping blacks

7 out it would have to kill
8 each year,

10 percent of its parishoners

that you clearly would say that would violate

9 the law.

QUESTION;

10
11

Mr. Coleman, if the IRS has the

power to do what you say it has, is there a limiting

12 principle to the right of the IRS to determine public

13 policy?
14

MR. COLEMAN;

15

QUESTION;

16

MR. COLEMAN;

Yes.

What is the principle?
The limiting principle is that

17 it has to make those determinations with respect to
18 those issues which have been reflected in statutes of
19 Congress and decisions of this Court which deal with the
20 basic, fundamental issues.
21

QUESTION;

So it couldn’t make the same

22 decision —
23

MR. COLEMAN;

And — and — here me out —

24 that particularly after Justice Blackmun’s dissent in
25 the case that follows next to the Simon case, Congress

50

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

has now amended Section 501(c)(3) and Section 170 to say

2 that those issues are subject to immediate court review,

3 and it seems to me that over the entire history, you
4 can *t say that this IRS has acted irresponsibly, and I
5 also suggest to you that Commissioner Thor, who made
6 this decision, certainly, as you know very well, is the

7 type of citizen that would not act irresponsibly.
8

QUESTION;

Could it make the same decision

9 with respect to sex discrimination?
10
11

SR. COLEHAN;
is not the question.

I think that that -- well, that

12 decision, would it be correct.

13

QUESTION;

14

SR. COLESANs

Is that what you mean?

Well, yes, of course.
Yes, okay.

Well, that is a —

15 that is a more difficult question.
16

QUESTION;

Why?

Is there any less a policy

17 nationally against sex discrimination?
18

SR. COLEBAN;

Well, I start with the fact that

19 I am very much in favor of the laws which are directed
20 against sex discrimination, but the fact is, we start

21 with the fact that we didn't fight a civil war over sex
22 discrimination, we didn't have the problem in this

23 country of trying to remove the provisions in the
24 Constitution which say that black people could be
25 brought here in slavery.

So, even though the pressing

51

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

of the fact that even during wartime, that we do make

25

certain exemptions with respect to certain types of

that we passed an amendment like the Thirteenth or

22

Could the IRS make a judgment —

23

MR. COLEMAN:

Hell, actually, with respect to

24

the 1950 statute talked about here, the fact is that the

25

IRS had made that ruling prior to the time that Congress

had enacted the statute.

And that has happened

2 throughout here, that the IRS has acted responsibly, has
3

made rulings, and then Congress has enacted statutes,

4

whether it is to bring in literary, scientific — all

5

that was done without a statute.

6
7

QUESTION*

Right, but what I am really trying

to get at is, where do we draw the line on the

8 policy-making authority of the IRS?
9
10

Is it just racial

discrimination ?
SR. COLEMAN*

Well, here, if you accept the

11

argument I have tried to make with respect to

12

ratification, your decision here will be that Congress

13

has determined that that is what the statute means, and

14

that is what it means.

15

QUESTION*

What did Congress ratify?

Was it

16

the power to make this sort of judgment, or was it only

the specific —

the statutory language here, this is what it meant.

22

have given to you.

rather clearly defined by others.
MR. COLEMAN*

2

Is that —

That's correct.

Yes, that's

3 correct.

QUESTION*

4

Certain policy.

You certainly

5 didn't submit to Justice Powell that the IRS could deny

6 tax exemption to pacifist organizations —
7

MR. COLEMANs

8

QUESTION*

No, I said I —

— because they were violating a

9 fundamental policy.

MR. COLEMAN*

10
11

I said that that's a different

question —

12

QUESTION*

I know, but --

13

MR. COLEMANs

— but I also said I felt that

14 they probably couldn't, based upon the —
15

QUESTIONS

10

MR. COLEMANs

17 upon the tremendous

You say they could?

and, I think, good history in this

18 country of recognizing
19 important thing,

They probably could not, based

pacifism as being a very

but the one —

20

QUESTION*

So the IRS —

21

MR. COLEMAN*

— thing that they determined

22 they don't recognize is racism.
23

QUESTION*

So you would say IRS does, then,

24 have some policy-making authority in the sense that they
25 can

choose between national policies —

HR. COLEMANs

2

QUESTION;

No.

Well

— as to which one justifies denial

3 ani which one doesn't.

MB. COLEMANs

5

QUESTION;

6

MR. COLEMANs

7

QUESTION;

8

MR. COLEMANs

Mr. Justice White, no more —

Is that right, or not?
— no more — no more —

Is that right?
No.

No more than one should

9 rightly say that you have policy.
10

QUESTION;

11

MR. COLEMANs

12

I'm sure that's what you said.
— because you have to be bound

by the Constitution and the statutes.

The IRS has to be

13 bound by the Constitution and the statutes the same way
14 you do, and what they can do, they can read that
15 statute, they can say it deals with —

16

QUESTION;

Well, there's a statute against sex

17 discrimination.
18

MR. COLEMAN;

19

QUESTION;

Yes.

Now, could the IRS or couldn't it

20 deny exemption based on the fact that a certain
21 organization is discriminating on the basis of sex?
22

MR. COLEMAN;

I would say that based upon the

23 decisions of this Court and the statutes that I know
24 dealing with that issue,

that that is a much more

25 difficult question.

QUESTIONS

1

So you can’t answer that yes or no.

2 but the IRS might answer it yes or no, and either way it
3 would be right?
HR. COLEMAN:

4

No, no, it wouldn’t.

Either

5 way, it would have to come before this Court and have
6 the decision —
QUESTION:

7

He would have to decide whether it

3 was right.
9

MR. COLEMAN:

That’s right, and when you

10 decide it, you would decide it under the Constitution
11

and the statute, and you couldn’t freewheel and have any

12 policy you wanted.

You would be bound by the

13 Constitution and the statutes,

and I say the IRS acted

14 in a responsible way, bound by the same rules.
15

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. BALL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 81-3 - REBUTTAL
MR. BALL:

May it please the Court, first of

20 all, I would point out that a full response to the
21 Congressional ratification argument is contained in the
22 government’s reply brief at Pages 15 to 19.
23

Let me come first to Fagin, if I may, and the

24 School for Pickpockets.

We certainly agree with Mr.

25 McNairy that the Commissioner has no discretion except

57

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

as to charitable organizations.

However, education has

2 a tradition, and the Treasury regulations specifically

3 provide a definition of education.

I don't think that

4 definition would ever be taken by the Courts to be read
5 in some bizzare fashion that would allow it to be
6 considered to be education in crimes.

As to Section 170, and Mr. Justice Stevens'

7

8 comments on that, the use -- the language in 170 says at
9 170(e),

"For purposes of this section," limited to that,

10 "For purposes of this section, the term charitable
11

contribution means a contribution or gift," et cetera.

2 Then follow five separate categories, only one of which
3 tracks the enumeration in 501(c)(3).

The 501(c)(3)

4 category includes the same separate enumeration as
5 appears in 501 —
6

QUESTION*

Well, then, are you saying, Mr.

7 Ball, that in 170 the word "charitable" has a different
8 meaning than it does in 501(c)(3)?
9

MR. BALL*

20 think when you take

2

QUESTION*

Yes, I think that's correct.

I

170, you have to —
So you disagree with Mr. Reynolds

22 then on this point.
23

MR. BALL*

No, I say —

24

QUESTION*

He said they had the same meaning.

25

MR. BALL*

When you go to Section 170, what

58

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

you find is a definition of charitable contribution.

2

QUESTION:

I understand.

3

MR. BALL:

And under that, you see about five

4

categories.

One of those is, and the word "charity”

5

therefore doesn’t bleed off on that, in one of those, it

6 says "organized and operated exclusively for religious,
7

charitable, scientific, literary, or educational

8 purposes."
9
10

11

I think that leaves standing the

separateness of the concept of religious or educational
or —
QUESTION:

Let me just be sure I have clearly

12

in mind your position.

The word "charitable" in 170 has

13

a different meaning than in 501(c)(3).

14

MR. BALL:

Yes, that is correct.

15

QUESTION:

On the subject of the charitable

16

aspects, do you know whether the school grants

17

scholarships, free tuition?

18
19

MR. BALL:

Yes, the joint appendix, Mr. Chief

Justice, at Page A-208, and I am quoting therefrom, the

20 board of trustees of the university:
21

"The university

does not discriminate on the basis of race in the

22 administration of its educational policies, admissions
23

policies, scholarship and loan programs, athletic and

24

other administered programs subject to and in conformity

25

with the university’s religious beliefs."

1

QUESTION!

Is the grant of a scholarship

2 something falling within the meaning of charitable?
3

NR. BALL:

Well, I suppose the grant of a

4

scholarship is a kindly act.

It is a — I don’t see it

5

as — It could be considered an act — it would be in

6 Bob Jones' situation an act in furtherance of religion,
7

because the school is nothing other than a religious

8 entity, and I would like to deal, if I may, at this
9

point with Mr. Coleman’s statement implying that Bob

10

Jones University is really a secular organization with

11

some religious fringes.

12

He mentions it being state certified.

The

13

Moose Club was licensed and state certified , state

14

licensed, but was not considered to be a state action

15

organization.

16

There is no basis at all for his attempt to distinguish

17

Bob Jones University from churches as a matter of

18

constitutional law.

Plainly, Bob Jones University is not.

The findings are very, very clear.

19

May I conclude this sentence?

20

The findings are extremely clear.

21

You have,

of course, the basic teaching of Lemon versus Kurtzman,

22 in which schools which taught so-called secular subjects
23
24
25

were considered to be entirely and inherently religious.
I deeply regret that I do not have time to
complete this argument.

Thank you.
