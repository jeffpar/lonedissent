ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHRYN A. OBERLY, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONEE
MS. OBERLY:

9

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the court.
This is a Clean Air Act case in which the

11
12

District of Columbia Circuit has ordered the government

13

to pay respondents $90,000 in attorney’s fees even

14

though they were completely unsuccessful on the merits

15

of their lawsuit.

16

award because we don’t believe that Congress has

17

authorized attorney’s fees for totally unsuccessful

18

parties.

19

The government challenges this fee

The case began in

1979 when respondents filed

20

petitions for review in the Court of Appeals challenging

21

EPA’s new Source Performance Standards for coal-fired

22

generating plants.

23
24
25

EDF, the Environmental Defense Fund

didn't challenge the substance of the regulations at all.
Instead, it argued that EPA had had meetings
with people outside of the agency after the close of the

—>3

1

public comment period and that those meetings had

2

resulted in a less stringent standard being adopted than

3

would have otherwise been the case.

4

challenged EPA’s statutory authority to adopt the type

5

of performance standard that it did and it also claimed

6

that the rule was unsupported by evidence in the record.

The Sierra Club

The Court of Appeals rejected each and every

7

8

one of respondent’s arguments and upheld the EPA

9

standards in every respect.

The court did write an

10

extremely lengthy and comprehensive opinion on the

11

merits, but nowhere in that opinion did the court

12

suggest that its decision to uphold the regulations was

13

a close one or that EPA had in any way acted improperly

14

during the rulemaking.
After the decision on the merits, respondents

15
16

sought attorney’s fees under Section 307(f) of the Clean

17

Air Act.

18

proceeding to review EPA regulations a court may award

19

reasonable attorney fees whenever it determines that a

20

fee award would be "appropriate".

21

case is about what Congress meant by the use of the word

22

appropriate.

23

That section provides that in any judicial

The dispute in this

was it your burden here today, Ms.

24

Oberly, to persuade the court that this was an abuse of

25

discretion on the part of the —

1.

NS. CBEPLYi

We're happy to take that burden

2

on. Your Honor, because we believe it was an abuse of

3

discretion.

4

enacting this statute, it becomes clear that Congress

5

did not intend or contemplate that attorney's fees would

6

be awarded to losing parties, who neither prevailed in

7

the technical sense- of obtaining a final judgment in

8

court, nor prevailed in the nontechnical sense of

9

getting the agency to change its conduct, change the

10
11
12

When one looks at Congress's purposes in

regulations or in any way alter its administration of
the act.
QUESTION:

What do you think Congress meant by

13

the language when appropriate that fees should be

14

awarded — when appropriate?

15

NS. GBERLY:

We think the legislative history

16

shows that Congress meant two things.

17

classes of plaintiff -- of litigants that Congress was

18

concerned about.

19

There were two

The first class was prevailing defendants,

20

which would include the government, who were subjected

21

to frivolous or harassing litigation and the second

22

class would be plaintiffs who either won in court in the

23 traditional sense of obtaining a judgment or who
24

achieved the result they set -- or something close to

25

the result they set out to achieve without obtaining a
5

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

formal judgment.

2

settlement or by EPA agreeing to change its regulations,

3

by something short of a final judgment on the merits.
But there is no indication, Your Honor, in the

4
5

That could be done, for example, by a

legislative history that Congress understood that, or

6

thought that it was authorizing fees to parties whose

7

only contribution to the Clean Air Act was to have a

8

court validate precisely what the agency had done.
The Court of Appeals standard in this case is

9
10

that attorney's fees are appropriate whenever a party

11

substantially contributes to the goals of the Clean Air

12

Act and on its face, we don’t have a real quarrel with

13

that standard.

14

applied to this and other cases like it where the

15

plaintiffs, or the petitioners, have failed to

16

accomplish anything concrete for the purposes of the

17

Clean Air Act.
The court found that the way respondents had

18
19
20

Our problem is with the standard as

contributed to the goals of the clean air act was by
labeling judicial review itself as an express and an

21

overriding goal of the statute and then it found that

22

respondents had contributed to that goal here by making

23

exemplary presentations on novel, important and complex

24

iss ues.

25

Our problem with that ruling is that Congress

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

has never said in the statute, which does set out the

2

goals of the statute, that judicial review is an

3

overriding goal, an express goal or any goal at all of

4

the Clean Air Act.

5

It's quite clear from the purposes of the

6

statute that the primary goal of the statute and the

7

relevant one to this case is to improve and maintain the

8

quality of the nation's air and when EPA fails to do

9

that by not following Congress’ instructions, then

10

judicia 1 review does help to further that goal.

11

when EPA has already done what Congress told it to do,

12

judicial review for its own sake is not a statutory goal

13

and it's certainly not one that Congress had indicated

14

it wanted to subsidize with attorney’s fee awards.

15
16
17
18

QUESTION :

But

Ms. Oberly, are you satisfied with

a standard that says if the suit furthered the goals of
the statute, it is appropriate?
MS. OBERLY:

Yes, Your Honor, we are.

Our

19

problem is that we think it’s impossible to further the

20

goals of the statute when a party —

21

QUESTION:

22

MS. OBERLY:

If you don’t prevail?
— when a party wins nothing on

23

the merits and in no way alters or improves or changes

24

EPA’s administration of the statute.

25

one would have to find — to agree with the Court of

Because to do that

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Appeals one would have to find the judicial review just

2

for the sake of validating what the agency already

3

correctly did is a goal of the statute.

4

anywhere set out in the statute or the legislative

5

history as a goal that Congress was --

6

QUESTION;

And that is not

Well do you think, did I understand

7

you to say that you think the court below applied the

8

correct — that the court below set forth the correct

9

standard, but simply applied it improperly?

10

MS. OBEELYi

We think the Court of Appeals

11

standard is perfectly plausible, given the guidance that

12

Congress provided in the legislative history.

13

who contributes to the goals of the Clean Air Act may,

14

in fact, be entitled — there may be other factors in a

15

particular case that would make an award inappropriate

16

but, in general, a party who contributes to the goals of

17

the Clean Air Act would be entitled to fees.

18
19

20
21
22

The party

Our problem hers is that these respondents
have done absolutely nothing to contribute —
QUESTION;

Can a party who loses the case ever

further the goals of the statute, in your view?
MS. OBERLY:

No, Your Honor, not if they not

23

only lose on the merits in the technical sense of

24

failing to obtain a judgment, but also lose in the

25

broader sense of failing to alter EPA's conduct or alter

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the regulations or the statute, I might add, applies not

2

only to the government as defendant, but to private

3

corporations as defendant and if they are unable,

4

through their lawsuit, as a catalyst, to get a private

5

defendant to change his behavior or its behavior, a

6

corporation's behavior, even short of a judgment, then

7

we would say that fees could not be appropriate.
QUESTIONS

8

The respondents cited, I think,

9

something like 20 other statutes, federal statutes, for

10

attorney's fees that do not require that the party have

11
12

prevailed.
Is there any other statute in which the

13

language appropriate has been used and has been

14

interpreted, as it was in this case?

15

tfS. OEERLY:

The statutes that respondents

16

cited, and I believe there are about 14 of them, are all

17

where appropriate statutes.

18

language is all -- the statutes they're citing have

19

identical language to the statute that the court is

20

construing today.

21

there, just like the Clean Air Act, there's no

22

legislative history to indicate the Congress thought it

23

was authorizing fee awards to parties who failed to

24

prevail in court or out of court, and so they've not, in

25

our opinion, added anything to the statute that you have

In other words, their

But in none of those statutes is

2

language in other statutes, but again, no additional

3

evidence that Congress contemplated the idea of paying

4

fees to totally unsuccessful parties.

5

They’ve added Congress using the same

And I want to make it clear that when I say

6

totally unsuccessful I mean not just unsuccessful in

7

court, but unsuccessful out of court.

They failed to

8

obtain a settlement out of court, they failed to change

9

the defendant’s conduct in any way, not just that they

10

failed to obtain a technical judgment in their favor.

11

It’s particularly striking —

12

QUESTION:

13

up —

14

MS. OBERLY:

15

QUESTION:

16

Could it be said that they speeded

Pardon.
Could it be said that this action

speeded up?
MS. OBERLY:

17

I don’t think so, Your Honor.

18

The Sierra Club in the mid, early to mid-70's asked EPA

19

to consider this kind of rulemaking and EPA had Sierra

20

Club’s petition for rulemaking under consideration

21

when —

22

QUESTION:

It took them more than ten years to

23 get around to it?
24
25

MS. OBERLY:

No, it did not take then ten

years, Your Honor.

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

QUESTION;

1

Well, you said '70.

2

that's what you said.

3

MS. OBERLY;

4
5

I thought

I said in the mid, excuse me,

early to mid-70*s was when they first approached EPA but
without a formal request.

They then went to the Court

6

of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, asked

7

that EPA be ordered to initiate this rulemaking.

8

Court of Appeals told the Sierra. Club, file a formal

9

petition with EPA and EPA will consider it.

The

While that petition was under consideration,

10
11

and it had not been under consideration for very long at

12

this point, Congress passed the 1977 Clean Air Act

13

Amendments.

14

precisely the rulemaking that Sierra Club had asked for.

\

Those amendments ordered EPA to do

And so it was Congress -- and it gave a

15
16

statutory deadline, and EPA later found itself under a

17

court order deadline to meet the timetable that Congress

18

had set.

19

20

QUESTION;
would you be here?

21

MS. OBERLY;

22

QUESTION;

23

Had it not been for this statute,

I’m sorry, I don't understand.
Well, you seem to say the statute

forced EPA to do this.

24

NS. OBERLY;

25

QUESTION;

The statute directed EPA -So my question is if the statute

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

had not been passed, would you have said that the

2

lawsuit did it?
MS. OBERLY :

3

No, Your Honor, because if the

4

statute had not been passed, it probably would have been

5

fully within EPA's discretion to decline to initiate a

6

rulemaking proceeding.

7

it impossible to tell now whether or not EPA would have

8

undertaken a rulemaking in response.
QUESTION:

9
10

The passage of the statute makes

Well didn't the action remind EPA

that they should do it?
MS. OBERLY:

11

It wasn't clear until the statute

12

was passed. Your Honor, that EPA should do it.

13

that time it was a matter of discretion with EPA and

14

because of the intervening passage of the statute there

15

really is no way of telling now, in hindsight, whether

16

EPA would acted favorably on Sierra Club’s petition or

17

not.

Prior to

And the one thing that is clear is that Congress

18

ordered EPA to undertake this rulemaking and EPA did it

19

in response to the statute.

20

QUESTION:

Of course, one could be facetious

21

and say that they ought to be paid just to plow through

22

the voluminous opinions of the law.

23

[Laughter]

24

MS. GBERLY :

25

Maybe the Court of Appeals judges

ought to get higher salaries to plow through the

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

opinion, bat respondents took this task upon themselves

2

voluntarily and it would seem to me that the government

3

has as good a claim to having contributed to the public

4

interest and to the purposes of the statute as do

5

respondents.
QUESTION:

6

Ms. Oberly, may I ask you a sort of

7

a hypothetical question?

8

kind of a three-cornered case.

9

attacking from one direction and the Sierra Club from

10

As I understand it, it was
The utilities were

the other direction.
Supposing there were an argument that was

11
12

raised by the utilities in its attack on the regulations

13

which was rejected for reasons set forth in the Sierra

14

Club brief, but not set forth in the government brief,

15

so that they would have accomplished nothing but they

16

might have helped defeat the utilties.

17

appropriate to give them the fees in that event?
MS. OBERLY:

18

Would it be

I don’t think so, Your Honor.

It

19

would be somewhat like a rule that this Court might

20

promulgate where parties filing amicus briefs would get

21

paid simply because the Court found the amicus brief

22

more helpful than the party's brief.
QUESTION:

23

Well, if Congress passed a statute

24

saying we can give fees where appropriate, that would be

25

different.

See, we don’t have such a statute.

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

?*S. OBEELYi

1

You would have to look to the

2

guidance of your statute, if you had one.

And when you

3

look to the guidance of the Clean Air Act, you don't

4

find that Congress thought that the Justice Department

5

needed assistance from self-volunteering public interest

6

groups to help in defending EPA regulations.
They may, in fact, provide such assistance in

7

8

such cases, but it's not something that can go into

9

expecting the government to pay the bill when we’re

10
11

already paying our own lawyers to defend these
regulations.

And in this case, EPA filed a 200 page

12

brief on the merits and EPA felt, the Justice Department

13

felt that it could defend its own interests.
We did not ask for help from the Sierra Club

14
15

or the Environmental Defense Fund.

The fact that they

16

wanted to offer it is their decision, but there's no

17

indication that Congress thought that the government

18

needed help from public interest groups in defending its

19

own interests.

20

statute or the legislative history.

That’s simply mentioned nowhere in the

21

An important point that I’d like to stress is

22

that Congress has expressly considered legislation that

23

would authorize fees for parties who don’t prevail at

24

all.

25

Act expressly had such a provision in it.

An early version of the Equal Access to Justice

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

The Justice Department objected to that

2

proposal as being radical and unacceptable and Congress

3

immediately dropped it from the Act so that the Act as

4

passed now requires a plaintiff to prevail.

5

that Congress has never passed a statute that says the

6

winning party is to pay the other side’s attorney’s

7

fees, even though it has had the opportunity to consider

The fact is

8 legislation that would do that.
9

On the other hand, in several statutes cited

10

in our brief, Congress has authorized the payment of

11

attorney’s fees just to allow citizens to participate in

12

agency rulemaking proceedings, even when their views are

13

not adopted.

14

knows how to draft the kind of language that the Court

15

of Appeals read into the statute in this case.

16

obvious fact is that that language just isn’t here.

17

So, there's no question that Congress

But the

Respondents claim that if the government’s

18

position were correct, there would have been no need for

19

Congress to change from the prevailing party standard

20

that it's used in other statutes and switch to an

21

appropriate standard.

22

that in 1970, which is the year that this type of

23

Eut what they've overlooked is

standard was first passed, the courts were interpreting

24

prevailing to mean that a party had to have a technical

25

final, favorable judgment in his favor in order to be

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1
2

eligible for fees
It wasn't until at least 1976 or 1977 that the

3

courts started liberalizing the interpretation of

4

prevailing party so that in

5

origin of this statute first came into being, a party

6

who prevailed by way of settlement would not necessarily

7

have been treated as a prevailing party for purposes of

8

an attorney's fee award.

9

1970, for example, when the

And it was, therefore, necessary in 1970 for

10

Congress to adopt a different standard than the

11

prevailing party standard in order to bring in to that

12

group of plaintiffs elibible for fee awards plaintiffs

13

who accomplish their result without getting a favorable

14

final judgment.

15
16
17

That situation, that state of the law is, as
regards the meaning of prevailing party, continued up
through 1975, 1977, in fact it wasn't until 1980 that

18

this court held that a party who obtained relief by way

19

of settlement could be deemed a prevailing party for

20

purposes of attorney’s fee awards.

21

So, in our view, at the time this statute was

22

first passed it was, in fact, necessary for Congress to

23

adopt a different standard, the appropriate standard.

24

But that doesn't go as far as respondents would take it

25

or as far as the Court of Appeals would take it to show

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that Congress actually intended or even thought about

2

the notion of paying fees to parties who accomplish no

3

tangible benefit.

4

I would also remind the court that, given the

5

country's long tradition against fee shifting, and given

6

the fact that we're aware of no other situation in which

7

a winning party has been ordered to pay a losing party's

8

fees, it's simply not plausible to assume that Congress

9

would have passed this type of legislation without

10
11

mentioning it, without debating it.
QUESTON:

Ms. Oberly, isn't it a little bit of

12

an overstatement to say winning party never pays the

13

losing party's fees?

14

litigation?

15

MS. OBERLY:

What about all our criminal

Under the Criminal Justice Act.

16

You're right, Your Honor, but that's not directly

17

against the opponent.

18

party, EPA, paying the other side's fees and what's more

19

important, or equally important, is that the statute is

20

not limited to the government as defendant.

21

Here, this is the victorious

Section 30U of the Act, the citizen suit

22

provision, would have private parties being a defendant

23

as often as the government and I find it implausible to

24

think that Congress would have assessed attorney’s fees

25

against a winning corporate defendant without saying

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that it actually meant for the winning corporate

2

defendant to pick up the other side’s legal fees.

3

There's nothing in the legislative history to show that

4

Congress contemplated that.

5

As far as the government is concerned, the

6

situation here is really quite similar to what the court

7

had before it in Lehman v. Nakshian where the court took

8

a look at what Congress's strong and unbroken prior

9

practice had been with respect to jury trials and

10

still somehow helped to accomplish a goal of the Clean

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD R. TYLER, JR., ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

6
7

8
9

10

MR. TYLERi

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
Harold Tyler for the respondents, Sierra Club
and Environmental Defense Fund.
Basically, our difficulties and disagreements

11

with the United States in this case come down to a

12

difference in reading in the statutory language and

13

quite a substantial difference in our appraisal of the

14

legislative history.

Indeed, it seems to me that the

15

government is taking a rather successively naive version

16

of what actually happened in the legislative history.

17

To begin with, as you know, in 1970 this

18

language did come into the Clean Air Act and some other

19

statutes of an environmental nature.

20

Section 304 was the area and the type of suit for which

21

Congress did pass this statute saying that fees could be

22

awarded when appropriate.

23

In the year 1970

Unfortunately, the government tends to ignore

24

what happened thereafter leading up to the 1977

25

amendments which, in very simple terms, we urge, made it

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

very clear that Congress specifically was trying to

2

address what had happened in the intervening years in

3

terms of appropriate judicial review, particularly of

4

rulemaking.
Congress was certainly aware that Section 304

5

6

did not specifically authorize petitions to review

7

regulations or rulemaking.

8

least two courts, the Fifth Circuit and the D.C.

9

Circuit, had held that the law was unclear and that even

10

11

In fact, prior to 1977 at

though Judge Levin Campbell, speaking for the First
Circuit, had allowed with his panel a petition for

12

review under Section 307, Congress thought that they

13

should address that problem.

14

in 1977 very specific legislation underscoring a

15

congressional tenet, we say, to encourage citizens and

16

groups with expertise in the environmental field to seek

17

review of EPA rulemaking.

And so they did by passing

Now, the government tosses this off as being a

18
19

situation where they didn't ask for the Sierra Club to

20

come in.

21

Fund to come in, and all of this would have been

22

resolved very much easily, more easily, much more

23

timely, h-ad there not been this petition for review,

24

which you know about, was filed in this important case.

25

Well, the fact is, we urge that what happened

They didn't ask for the Environmental Defense

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

is that Congress illustrated very clearly that, contrary

2

to what the government argues, they want 307 cases to

3

keep EPA honest, to put it in simplistic, blunt terms.

4

But more importantly and more fairly, perhaps, they wish

5

to encourage outsiders, particularly outsiders like

6

these two organizations, who have competence to handle

7

these complex cases.
QUESTION:. Well, Mr. Tyler, that would be

8
9

something of a new departure.

I would think Congress

10

would have said so in so many words if they had intended

11

that.
MR. TYLER:

12

I think. Justice Rehnquist, that

13

of course Congress didn't have, the legislative history

14

doesn’t have somebody saying look, this year, 1977, we

15

want the phrase when appropriate, which we’re going to

16

continue for 307 cases, to mean that even losers get

17

fees.

18

what they did say.

They didn’t say that.

That’s true.

But here’s

The House and the Senate were aware that the

19

20

First Circuit had reasoned that in a case, which as the

21

government fairly points out, there the environmental

22

groups were not total losers, in the old fashioned tort

23

contract —

24

QUESTIONS:

They won on some issues?

25

MR. TYLER:

Yes.

But the rationale of Judge

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Campbell seems to us to be very clear and seems, more

2

importantly than to us, to the Congress to have

3

indicated, as Judge Campbell pointed out, that there

4

should be an encouragement for citizen suits in this

5

complex field where people just don't have the money or

6

the competence or the expertise to, you know, just sort

7

of come in and do it easily.

8

This is a case where not any doubt, I think,

9

what Congress intended to do was not to reward counsel

10

in the sense of giving restitution to counsel or their

11

clients, such as the Sierra Club or EDF, but to

12

encourage them to come in and speak their piece in

13

judicial review proceedings.
QUESTION;

14

Hell that's a perfectly

15

understandable motive if Congress, indeed, did entertain

16

it.

17

spell it out to some extent, rather than simply using

18

the word appropriate?

19

But my question still remains, why didn't they

MB. TYLEB;

Well, there is language in the

20

legislative history, concededly, if I were standing here

21

today and had a chance to rewrite what was said, I'd

22

have it a lot clearer, I agree.

23

strands of evidence, if you will, Justice Eehnquist,

24

indicating the Congress understood quite clearly that

25

this isn't a simplistic situation, like the government

But there's a number of

argues.

The results didn't clean our air in a

2

measurable sense, ergo, nobody gets counsel fees.

3

don't really think, the government means to argue that

4

ultimately.

I

The point is, the legislative history shows

5

6

that it would be in the public interest, as Congress saw

7

it, to permit judicial review of rulemaking on a timely

8

basis, a 60-day statute of limitations, and they

9

encourage private individuals and institutions with

10

lawyers to come in and do this and to even get paid when

11

they lost.

12

that point, as did the First Circuit.

13

point.

And the Court of Appeals, in this case, saw
Congress saw the

You see, the government keeps trying to tie us

14
15

in to the legislative history of 304 in 1970.

16

good reason for that.

17
18

There's a

They don’t want to see anything

develop to indicate and anticipate and take care of what
happened in the year 1977.
They want to treat this as if it's an old

19
20

fashioned, simple litigation, or even a fairly modern,

21

simple litigation, like an abatement case.

22

this isn't an abatement case.

Of course

They also suggest that private parties could

23
24

be defendants.

25

misspoke.

Section 307 suits, I'm sure Ms. Oberly

She knows that you cannot be a defendant if

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

you're a private party in a 307 petition for review

2

unless you are brought in as an intervenor.

3

conceding that the history is not clear, as either the

4

government would like or the respondents would like, we

5

argue the balance tips in favor of what the Court of

6

Appeals did in this case.

So that,

Now, the government also likes to downplay

7

8

this case and say, well you know, there really weren't

9

that much happened.

It began, all in '79, it was

10

routine.

11

groups out in the west began to be concerned about

12

emissions of sulphur dioxide, particularly in the

13

western coal-fired utility plants.

14

It's a little more than that.

Back in 1973,

It is true, as the government says, that in

15

1975 was really the formal kickoff, but there's been a

16

long and tortuous history, not only under the banner or

17

case name of the case that we're here before you this

18

morning, but in a case before Judge Skelly Wright in

19

1975, as I recall, brought by some of the Indian tribes,

20

raising this issue.

21

We’re talking in this case about an issue that

22

engendered a simply enormous, complex record.

It's also

23

a little bit disingenuous, it seems to me, to argue that

24

these people who came in here for the Sierra Club,

25

particularly in terms of the merits issues and then

25

1

later EDF, in terns of the administrative 1 a w issues

2

which were settled in this case, to say tha t nobody won

3

anything.

4

Obviously there was the win in th e sense that

5

the public, in the broad sense, had somebod y coming in

6

to petition for review where you had a bran d new Section

7

111 of the 1977 Act dealing with standards for emissions

8

of sulphur dioxide.

9

10

11

And one of the great issues that was resolved
here, and it wasn’t an easy issue, and the Court,
contrary to the government’s position, said it wasn’t an

12

easy issue, and that was the variable stand ards, west as

13

opposed to east, for emissions of coal-fire d utility

14

smokestacks.

15

QUESTION;

Mr. Tyler, is there an y reason to

16

think that the same result wouldn’t have be en reached

17

simply if the government had defended its o wn position

18

without the help of the environmental group s.

19

MR. TYLER;

Your Honor, as an ex- bureaucrat

20

I’d like to admit that there is some ground s for

thinking that the government possibly reach es the same

better than that.

But think again about how

4

we award, true, by statute, fee out, if you will, the

legislature fsss to lawyers who represent defendants in

criminal cases and, you know, in certain Circuits it’s

7

very hard to win a criminal case at all and the United

8

States pays the lawyers.
QUESTION:

9

10

Of course, there the purpose is to

provide the criminal defendant with an attorney.
MR. TYLER:

11

Right.

And we argue that here the

12

purpose is to provide the Congress -- the American

13

people, but purports in the limited sense we are dealing

14

with here, somebody to come in and speak for the

15

environmental interests.

Well, but the Criminal Justice Act

17

is express when it says our purpose is to provide a

18

cri minal defendant with an attorney in every case, win

19

or lose.
MR. TYLER:

20

Admittedly, it's clearer

21

language.

I have to concede that, but if you analyse

22

the interplay between what happened in 1970,

23

particularly in courts, then what happened in the

24

Congress, in such evidence as we have -- obviously both

25

Ms. Oberly and I both would agree we'd like, from our

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

respective points of view, to have clearer statements,

2

but we say the only fair construction is that Congress

3

wanted to encourage this type of litigation and

4

recognized that the way to do it was to hold out that in

5

certain cases, not all, even if you lost, you'd get paid.
Mow let me add to that something which I think

6
7

is important.

8

others, that it is poor policy to encourage suits by

9

paying losers.

The government may be arguing, among

Now, of course, none of us, I assume,

10
11

certainly in our briefs we don't have any studies to

12

show whether this is true or not, but let me say that I

13

think that Congress was aware in 1977, and indeed even

14

back in '70, that you'll get frivolous lawsuits no

15

matter what you do.

16

judges can't small out frivolous lawsuits, I will be

17

surprised.

18

And my answer to that is, look, if

So that the next step to go with, and I think

19

the government may be trying to say this is, that if you

20

have a statute permitting paymen t of losers, you may get

21

more frivolous lawsuits.

22

and I think human experience proves it's not true.

23

I don't believe that's true

It's better to encourage, particularly

24

citizens and groups who know something about

25

environmental problems, to come in and petition for

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

review and get payment, in appropriate cases only, where

2

they lose, than to discourage them totally so that they

3

won't even bring petitions.

4

And finally, let me make another point here.

5

The government says, with some plausible record basis

6

for it, that the problem is that Congress didn't flesh

7

out the words where or when appropriate and that, of

8

course, is literally true.

9

understandable to you all. I’m sure, and it is simply

But our argument on that is

10

that courts have long, whether federal, state or local

11

on whatever issue, been able to exercise discretion with

12

even less precision than this.

13

And a good example is the cases here in this

14

Circuit, which, of course, is where you're going to get

15

most of the cases.

16

same day, an eloquent dissent by Judge Wilkey in Alabam^

17

Power in which he said that when appropriate was very

18

vague and it put the court in the political thicket and

19

so on and so on.

20

Following our case, there was on the

Time passes and in a case which sometimes

21

lawyers refer to as North Slope v. Andrus, or as in our

22

briefs is called, Village of Kaktovik v. Watt, Judge

23

Wilkey himself accurately summed up the holding of the

24

panel in this case, applied those rules, if you will, or

25

those criteria; came to the conclusion that in that case
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the losers did not deserve to win, parsing out all of

2

the criteria that would make sense to any judge or court

3

that ever has fixed fees on any basis.
Therefore, we sum up and say to Your Honors

4
5

that this is a case where Congress clearly intended to

6

say under the appropriate circumstances, subject to the

7

sound discretion of the fee fixing panel or court, there

8

can be fees paid in these environmental cases, even

9

where there has been a technical loss on petitions for

10

judicial review.

Thank you, very much.

this could be done and, indeed, already has been done,

I admit that.

But I would answer, though, that

even in a 307 environment.

That really, to me, seems to

be the point of Village of Kaktovik under the same
