ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS, WASHINGTON, ET AL.
MR. EIKENBERRY;

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
This case involves the effort of the United

10

11

States, successful so far, to prevent the State of

12

Washington from deriving any sales tax or use tax from

13

the significant federal construction that's going on in

14

our state.

15

controversy is about as a practical matter and then

16

proceed on to the decisions of this Court and how we

17

believe they do allow the application of this sales and

18

use tax.

19

I’d like first to explain'what the

Washington imposes a general retail sales tax

20

on the sales of tangible personal property and other

21

services in the State of Washington.

22

usual complementary use tax on the other side of it.

23

There is a single rate of 5.4 percent embodied in a

24

single statute applicable to all of these sales

25

occurring in the State, and this by far is our single

those materials and we would pay it to the seller.

12

same is true if we bought an automobile or food or

13

cigarettes or whatever.

14

The

The legal problem arises because we treat

15

federal contractors differently from nonfederal

16

contractors in the construction projects.

17

the Federal Government is challenging our system, which

18

gets more revenue out of nonfederal construction than it

19

does for federal construction, and this is true because

20

for nonfederal construction projects the 5.4 percent tax

21

is added to the entire price of a nonfederal job.

22

is, not just for materials but also for labor and profit

23

and overhead.

All of these go into the tax base.

QUESTION*

I take it when you — the

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

contractor adds that to his price to the owner, is that

2

it?

3

MB. EIKENBEERI:

4

QUESTION:

5

That is correct.

Well, but then he hasn't paid his

sales tax on his bricks, I take it* is that it?
MR. EIKENBERRY:

6

If we're talking about a

7

nonfederal contractor. Your Honor, that sales tax is

8

added to the price that's finally presented.
QUESTION:

9
10

But the contractor hasn't paid a

tax when he buys his bricks?
MR. EIKENBERRY:

11

The private contractor does

12

not buy — does not pay the materials sales tax when he

13

buys his bricks.
QUESTION:

14

Exactly.

Well, a while ago you

15

said that when a contractor buys bricks or his materials

16

he pays a tax.

MR. EIKENBERRY:

17
18

21

The federal contractor does,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

19

20

Well, he doesn't.

I know, but the private contractor

does not.
MR. EIKENBERRY:

All right.

Then I didn't

22

present it clearly, because what I was attempting to do

23

in the original way I described the sales tax is to show

24

that across the board on the sale of retail items,

25

whether it be bricks or cars or cigarettes or whatever,

5

QUESTION*

He is not paying that tax.

7

QUESTION;

General Eikenberry, if the State

8

itself or one of the pplitical subdivisions of the State

is building a construction project, what is the tax in

10

that instance.
MR. EIKENBERRY;

QUESTION;

14

HR. EIKENBERRY*

Yes, Your Honor, that's

It is the same 5.4 percent at

So if the State itself were

building it is treated like a private citizen would be —

18

MR. EIKENBERRY*

That is true, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION;

— in a building project.

20

QUESTION*

And with respect to private and

21

State contracts, the State taxes the contract price at

22

the time the contractor delivers possession to the

23

owner?

24
25

MR. EIKENBERRY*

That's true. Your Honor,

including overhead, profit, materials, and everything

QUESTION:

NR. EIKENBERRYs

4

QUESTION:

5

General, have you finished?
Yes, Your Honor.

I take it you concede that the *75

amendment was to catch federal construction?
MR. EIKENBERRY:

6

There's no question but what

7

this statute was designed to apply the sales tax to

8

these transactions, which were significant in our State

9

and we believe deserve to help bear the brunt of cost of

10

services delivered by State government.
QUESTION:

11

In a sense, the State of Washington

12

is a victim of its own legislative move back in 1941,

13

isn ’t it?

14

MR. EIKENBERRY:

I would resist categorizing

15

it as a victim, Your Honor, because, like most states,

16

these taxing schemes evolve over a period of time and as

17

circumstances change and one type of activity increases

18

it becomes more apparent —

19
20

QUESTION:

But you're a victim only in the

sense you have this litigation on your hands —

21

MR. EIKENBERRY:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Well, yes.

— only in the sense you have the

litigation on your hands.
QUESTION:

Well, if you treated all

contractors like you treat Government contractors there

wouldn't be any problem, would there?
MR. EIKENBERRY:

2
3

That’s certainly true. Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Because the federal contractor

could pass it on to the Federal Government in terms of

— with the Dravo Contracting

case.

13

QUESTION:

In ’35, wasn’t it?

14

MR. EIKENBERRY:

Yes.

1937 I believe was the

15

time that the Court made that step and said that it was

16

entirely appropriate to apply such a tax.

17

If I may

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. EIKENBERRY:

Go ahead.

I’m sorry.

In fact, that’s the position

20

being taken here by the Government, we believe, in

21

advancing these arguments, that is, that if the same

22

identical tax were applied then to contractors in the

23

private sector then there would be no argument.

24
25

On the contrary, we're saying that the fact
that everybody pays in our state a retail sales tax,

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that the tax on the nonfederal construction, applied the

2

way it does, makes all the difference in the world

3

constitutionally speaking, and that the Government's

4

objections are formalistic and hypertechnical.

5

believe the principles of federalism and the purpose of

6

the supremacy clause does not require this kind of

7

rigidity or inflexibility.

8
9

We

Further, we believe the objections of the
United States disregard the common sense that this Court

10

has embodied in prior decisions beginning with the case

11

of James against Dravo Contracting Company in 1937,

12

proceeding on up through the U.S. against Fresno County

13

case in 1977 and as recently as last year, the same

14

principles being articulated in U.S. against,Hexico.

15

I’d like to suggest a case that illustrates

16

the hypertechnical approach being relied on by the

17

Government.

18

Railway against Gallagher in the State of California, a

19

taxpayer was arguing that application of the use tax to

20

property that they brought into the state from out of

21

state was unfair and discriminatory as far as the

22

interstate commerce clause was concerned because it did

23

not equate with a state retail sales tax, which of

24

course applied to vendors and vendees in that state.

25

As long ago as 1939 in Southern Pacific

One of the reasons for the complaint was the

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

theory that the retailer might be able to absorb part of

2

that tax, and this Court said no, that that was

3

hypertechnical, the difference in the legal incidence in

4

the way those taxes were applied made no constitutional

5

difference at all.

6

equal charge against what is used, whatever its source.

7

And this is the approach we’re urging on the Court to

8

take today with regard to this hypertechnical, what we

9

believe formalistic complaint.

And as the Court said, there is an

10

We’re submitting the Court should construe the

11

supremacy clause so as to protect the Federal Government

12

against a state tax which places the Government at a

13

competitive disadvantage in obtaining resources

14

necessary to perform its functions, but at the same time

15

construing the supremacy clause so as to allow the state

16

the greatest flexibility to fashion a tax scheme that

17

will fit our particular circumstances.

18

We certainly acknowledge, just to lay the

19

groundwork,

20

a tax directly on the Federal Government.

21

McColluch against Maryland, starting 160 years ago.

22

that is why the legal incidence of this tax was not

23

imposed on the Government here in the State of

24

Washington.

25

that the state may not lay the incidence of
That is
And

And of course, just to make the step, this

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Court held that a state — it diverted from that and

2

said that the state may impose a tax on people dealing

3

with the Federal Government in 1937 in the James against

4

Dravo case, and this Court held that that may occur even

5

though the cost of that tax is passed on to the Federal

6

Government, even though that becomes an expense of doing

7

that business.

8
9

So that brings us, I believe, to the test, the
question here before the Court today:

What is the test

10

that should be applied to determine whether a tax with

11

those dealing with the Federal Government is

12

discriminatory under the supremacy clause?

13

Court, as I say, indicated it was all right for a state

14

to tax contractors dealing with the Federal Government

15

if the same tax is imposed on all other contractors, and

16

in so doing the Court implicitly accepted the principle

17

that economic forces will work the same in both the

18

federal and the nonfederal sectors.

19

Now, the

And we suggest that we can go from that case

20

to say that they become economic burden partners in both

21

the federal and the nonfederal sectors.

22

burden partners, we'd suggest that we have a case where

23

parties to a transaction which is subject to a tax,

24

where the legal incidence of the tax falls on one party

25

or the other and the economic burden of the tax will be

By economic

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

determined as part of the negotiations in response to

2

market forces which would apply to those kinds of

3

transactions at that time.
So of course the question is, does this

4
5

economic burden partner principle carry over to the case

6

we're presenting to the Court today, and we believe that

7

it does.

8

when the legal incidence of a tax is on a different

9

partner in the federal transaction than it does on the

10
11

The question is, does this principle apply

partner in the nonfederal transaction.
QUESTIONS

In that sense the state tax is

12

discriminating against contractors with the Federal

13

Government, isn't it?

14

MS. EIKENBEREY:

In that sense. Your Honor,

15

the incidence is on different partners in the

16

transaction, but I believe we can show that it is not a

17

discriminatory tax simply because that incidence is

18

placed on different partners to the transaction.

19

QUESTION*

How do you distinguish the Moses

20

Lake Homes and Phillips Chemical Company cases that are

21

relied upon by the Solicitor General?

22

MR. EIKENBEREY;

Each of those discrimination

23

cases, Your Honor, are a situation where the taxes were

24

different from the taxes being applied against other

25

people that might be in comparable transactions.

In the

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Moses Lake case, as you recall, we had a state sales tax

2

on leasehold Interests of people renting federal

3

housing, and because of the way the tax was applied it

4

was simply higher than any other tax for similar

5

leaseholds.

6

In the case of Phillips, where we had a

7

manufacturing company leasing a property from the

8

Federal Government, producing ammonia, because of the

9

way the tax was applied again, it was simply higher than

10

it was to any other leasehold interest, and it states so

11

factually, we believe they're significantly different.

12

Here we have the same tax.

13

QUESTION*

Wasn't the concern of the Court, at

14

least in Phillips and perhaps in Moses Lake too, that

15

the state treated contractors dealing with the state

16

more favorably than contractors dealing with the Federal

17

Government?

18

MB. EIKENBERRYs

There was — there was some

19

discussion about whether people in the same identical

20

situation as federal contractors were treated the same.

21

But I believe that the bulk of the concern of the

22

opinion was concerned with the fact that across the

23

board the tax was not the same.

24
25

QUESTION*

Do you think that analyzing the

Washington -- the economic burdens of the Washington

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

transaction, it can be fairly said that Washington, that

2

the State of Washington treats those contracting with

3

the Federal Government less favorably than those

4

contracting with the State of Washington?
MR. EIKENBERRYs

5
6

less fairly, Your Honor, and —

7

QUESTIONS

8

MR. EIKENBERRYs

9

We say we do not treat them

Less favorably.
We say that they’re being

treated equally in both the federal sector and the

10

nonfederal sector.

And let me use the way this thing

11

developed in the Detroit case, U.S. versus City of

12

Detroit in 1958, where you had a situation of the tax

13

being imposed on the leasehold interest of the

14

Borg-Warner Corporation, doing private manufacturing,

15

and the Court upheld that tax because there was a

16

comparable tax on landowners who passed their cost on to

17

their tenants.
So there was incidence falling in different

18
19

places.

20

was on the tenant, and on the nonfederal situation the

21

tax was on the landlord.

22

that there was an equalization process going on there,

23

that it was inevitable that these burdens would be

24

shared.

25

It was on -- in the federal situation the tax

Nevertheless, the Court held

The Court did not use that expression, but it

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

was obvious that it was viewed as the burden of the tax

2

passing from the private landlord to his tenant and the

3

possessory interest tax passing from the Federal

4

Government’s tenant to the Federal Government, and there

5

was an equalization of the tax that fell on the use of

6

property in that state, and therefore it was not

7

regarded as being discriminatory.
QUESTION;

QUESTION;

19

and then he's going to risk whether or not he can — how

20

much of it he can get from the Federal Government.

21

MS. EIKENBERRY;

Your Honor is mentioning, of

22

course, the up-front money problem that we have

23

mentioned in our brief.

24

QUESTION;

Yes.

25

MR. EIKENBERRY;

And there is at least three

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

different aspects that need to be touched on in

2

responding to that.

3

First of all, the economic forces of the

4

marketplace are going to see to it that the parties in

5

negotiating the terms of their contract will balance

6

out, we believe, as between federal and nonfederal.

7

other words, in the federal sector there are such things

8

as advance funding accounts that can be used and have

9

been used, that may completely eliminate that problem

In

10

for the private contractor, and over on the nonfederal

11

side there are comparable arrangements that can be

12

worked out.

13

In any event, it’s significant, I think, to

14

point out that the Federal Government has not complained

15

of that as being a problem, nor is there evidence before

16

the Court or in the record on that matter.

17

If we can go ahead and, discussing this same

18

issue that's been raised here by the Court, compare what

19

occurred in the case of United States versus County of

20

Fresno, where we again had the legal incidence falling

21

on one partner in the federal transaction and a

22

different partner in the nonfederal transaction.

23

of course, under authority of state law a possessory —

24

a leasehold possessory interest tax was imposed against

25

tenants of the Federal Government.

There,

A comparable tax, a

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

property tax , was imposed by the state on landlords in

2

the private sector.

3

opinion presumed that the economic burden of that real

4

property tax on the landlord would be passed to the

5

tenant.

And the Court in writing that

6

Now, of course the presumption then has to be

7

compared with the federal situation, and the Court said

8

nevertheless that the tax was reasonable, that it was

9

fair, that the same market forces applied to both

10

parties as they arrived at their pricing level, and that

11

the placement of the legal incidence in that case was

12

irrelevant.

13

Now, of course there is another matter that

14

comes out of that case that needs to be addressed, and

15

that was the matter, the reasons indicated by Justice

16

Stevens in his dissent that the tax did appear on its

17

face to be discriminatory because of the fact that the

18

Government initially, at least, in its pricing scheme

19

was collecting both the cost — because they were basing

20

their prices on comparable market value or prices for

21

rental units, was including both the possessory interest

22

tax and the — or rather, including the value of

23

property tax and then the tenant was having to pay the

24

possessory interest tax.

25

QUESTIONS

Refresh my recollection.

Wasn't it

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

also true in that case that the possessory interest tax

2

was paid on state-owned property as well?

3

MR. EIKENBERRYs

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. EIKENBERRY:

That is true. Your Honor.

Which is different from this case.
But nevertheless, the

6

principle is the same, because the only way to explain

7

the case and I believe the bottom line is that the tax

8

did not discriminate .against the Government and thereby

9

breach the protective mantle of the supremacy clause in

10

that case, because the Government, even if it assumed

11

the burden of the tax by lowering its rents, would not

12

be placed at a competitive disadvantage vis a vis other

13

landlords who had to pay over a portion of their rent to

14

the state government.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, if you're

16

17

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

18

MR. SMITH:

19

20

Mr. Smith.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
As the Court is well aware, there is a

21

22

fundamental tenet in our Constitution providing for the

23

immunity of the Federal Government absolutely from state

24

taxation.

25

immunity, as Chief Justice Marshall said, is the

McCulloch established that federal tax

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

unavoidable consequence of that supremacy which the

2

Constitution has declared.
Now, we all agree that McCulloch established

3
4

that the states cannot lay a direct tax upon the United

5

States.

6

doctrine which is equally unquestioned.

7

Court has said on numerous occasions, that a tax may be

8

invalid, even though it does not fall directly upon the

9

United States, if it operates so as to discriminate

10

against the Government or those with whom it deals.

11

Court said that in the United States versus City of

12

Detroit and has reaffirmed that in Phillips Chemical

13

Company, Moses Lake Homes, and a whole host of

14

precedents.

But there is an important corollary to that
It is, as the

the very functioning of the Federal Government would be

20

indisputably invalid.

23

held in Graves ex rel. versus O'Keefe.

For example, if a state attempted to tax the

So the rule that has emerged in more recent
terms from the decisions of this Court is that the

1

economic burden on a federal function of a state tax

2

imposed upon those who deal with the Federal Government

3

renders the tax invalid if it is not imposed equally on

4

the other similarly situated constituents of the state.

5

In our view, the Court of Appeals correctly identified

6

the Washington sales tax at issue here as a classic

7

example of discriminatory taxation.

All will agree, and the State indeed properly
concedes, that the Washington legislature engaged in a

say that was a desire to circumvent the immunity of the

based on the full contract price, had a separate sales

tax, one on the owner for the labor involved and one on

the contractor for the cost of materials incorporated in

the project, and the tax on the federal contractors

remained the same as it is now, I assume you would say

that's constitutional.
MR. SMITH:

same as all other contractors.

And under that assumption it would

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. SMITH:

In other words, so that the

23

Federal Government's immunity would prevent the state

24

from imposing a tax on the — you know, on the

25

contractor's profit, you know, which would be the cost

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

borne by the Federal Government.
But the statutory history reveals that that

3

really, and the statute indicates, that that really

4

isn’t what happened here, because in 1935 when this tax

5

was enacted the tax was on, the Washington sales tax,

6

was on sales to building contractors.

7

the Attorney General’s example, if a contractor

8

purchased a nail or some other component that went into

9

a house from a hardware company, that contractor would

That is, to use

10

have to pay the sales tax.

11

that sales tax, whether — no matter whom they dealt

12

with, the Federal Government, the state government, or a

13

private party.

14

All contractors would pay

The tax was imposed on contractors.

In 1941 the State wanted to — the State

15

changed the tax, and what it did was it changed the tax

16

to sales by contractors, so that the tax began to be

17

paid by consumers.

18

in order to increase its tax base, in order to include

19

the contractor’s profit in the tax base.

20

Now, the State did this legitimately

But because it did this and imposed the tax at

21

the customer level, of course, the Federal Government

22

was a customer; all those transactions became immune

23

under the absolute immunity of the Federal Government

24

that this Court has never questioned.

25

So now, for more than 30 years the State was

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

apparently content with this choice, that is, an

2

enhanced tax base in the private and state sphere,

3

gaining enhanced revenues from these sources at the

4

price of sacrificing — and indeed, at the

5

constitutional price of sacrificing revenue from Federal

6

Government contractors.

7

And in 1975 it saw that, when federal

8

construction activity in the State of Washington became

9

greater and more intense, the State sought to include

10

somehow the Federal Government’s contracting activity in

11

its tax base, while retaining the enhanced tax base on

12

private construction.

13

that aspect of its tax law.

14

The State did not want to give up

So in 1975 the State amended its sales tax to

15

impose, as we have it now, a tax upon contractors for

16

the United States, but not upon other contractors.

17

there’s no doubt, indeed, that this — these amendments

18

intended to circumvent the federal tax immunity.

19

legislative history indicates that, the staff reports

20

indicate it, that there some question as to whether this

21

was discriminatory under the decisions of this Court,

22

and indeed the State so acknowledges that intent.

23

Now,

The

Now, in our view these 1975 amendments

24

effectively single out the Federal Government’s

25

contractors for state taxation, and therefore runs afoul

8

MR. SMITH;

9

QUESTION;

10

11

It's

Indeed.
It puts a lesser burden on the

Federal Government than it does on the State.
MR. SMITH;

Yes, but I think as the Court

12

indicated in County of Fresno in describing the

13

McCulloch rationale, the Court said if the state’s power

14

to tax the bank were recognized in principle, the Court

15

doubted the ability of federal courts to review each

16

exercise of such power to determine whether the tax

17

would or would not destroy a federal function.

18

The important thing, as the Court of Appeals

19

recognized here, is that once you have — once you have

20

a state legislature’s identification of federal activity

21

for different tax treatment, that that indicates a

22

potential for abuse which triggers the application of

23

the immunity clause.

And in our view this fits in perfectly, fits in

2

appropriately, with the Court’s — with the entire

3

panoply of decisions which examine the state taxes in

4

terms of where the legal incidence is imposed.

5

QUESTIONS

Although if they treated all

6

contractors alike and just put a sales tax on the

7

purchases of a contractor from all of his suppliers and

8

left it up to the contractor to pass it on to his owner

9

if he could, the fact that the United States would end

10
11

up paying the tax would not invalidate it.
MR. SMITH:

Indeed, that was the situation in

12

1935, and that really flows from the Court’s statement

13

in King S Boozer.

14

QUESTIONS

Even though the -- even though now

15

the burden on the Federal Government, if you accept, if

16

you accepted the Washington tax, is no greater.

of Maryland must have argued before the Court in

24

not going to make this that onerous or difficult.

say your argument is reminiscent of a good deal of the

2

decisional law of this Court before James versus Dravo

3

and King & Boozer, where it was simply an exultation of

4

form over substance.

5

MR. SMITHs

I don’t think so, Mr. Justice

6

Rehnquist, and the reason I don’t think so is that we

7

are examining here where the legal incidence of this tax

8

falls.

9

only on federal contractors.

It’s a tax, it's a sales tax which is imposed
And we look around and say

10

to ourselves, if company A goes into the State of

11

Washington and it engages in a federal contract, it has

12

to pay this tax and it has to, as Justice White pointed

13

out, put up this money up front and whether it gets back

14

the money or not is really wholly problematic.

it does business with a private party it doesn’t have to

QUESTION;

It's a description of how they're
And indeed, as I think the Court

Mr. Smith, in the County of Fresno

8

we have exactly the same situation we have here.

The

9

tax was placed on renters who rented from the Federal
«

10

Government, and we got around that in County of Fresno

11

by making certain assumptions about who was going to

12

bear the economic burden.

13

Why can’t we make the same assumptions here

14

and assume that, for instance, that the tax couldn’t be

15

shifted from the federal contractor to the Federal

16

Government itself?

17

MR. SMITH;

I think that kind of assumption --

18

well, first of all, let me answer that in two parts.

19

think, to begin with, the assumption that the Court

20

engaged in in County of Fresno, equating the renters in

21

private property with the Forest Service rangers, was an

22

appropriate, an arguably appropriate analogy between two

23

parties who occupied similar positions in the economic

24

spectrum, that is, renters of property.

25

Here we have a situation where the State is

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

I

1

attempting to save its tax by pointing to the customers,

2

the private customers, and saying, we don't have to

3

worry about the fact that we're not taxing the private

4

contractors because we're taxing the private customers.

5

The private customers are not comparable to

6

contractors.

7

They're really quite different.

And the point — in response on another level,

8

Justice O'Connor, let me simply say that that argument,

9

the point is that somehow it's all going to work out

10

because the customers are bearing the tax, I think

11

places unnecessary or improper emphasis on the fact that

12

these taxpayers here are projects, they are construction

13

projects.

14

The taxpayers in this case, in these cases,

15

are not projects; they are parties.

And in this

16

particular instance we have a situation where the

17

contractor who deals with the Federal Government is

18

subject to tax and the contractor who deals with a

19

private party and the State is not subject to tax.

20

21

you've suggested, that the discriminatory treatment

could be cured simply if the United States would

reimburse its contractors.

1

Court has repeatedly indicated it has never questioned,

2

as the cause of the discriminatory treatment here.
The immunity is not the problem, we submit.

3
4

It is the first principle that's to be considered, the

5

unavoidable consequence of that supremacy that the

6

Constitution has declared.
We think that the State cannot seek to

7

8

identify the Federal Government's either refusal or

9

disinclination to reimburse its contractors as an

10

affirmative justification for its invalid discriminatory

11

or indeed different treatment of federal contractors.

12

And

13

QUESTIONi

Of course, the Government got into

14

this case only because it reimbursed and then sued for a

15

refund, didn't it?

16

MR. SMITH:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SMITH:

I assume so, I assume so.
You assume?
I assume that the Government —

19

although I suppose that the Government — the Government

20

is a party in this case.

21

Government has reimbursed it, but I assume that that *s

22

probably right.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. SMITH:

25

But again —

I'm not sure that the

I thought you did reimburse them.
I think that’s probably right.

QUESTION:

1

But we're talking about a case

2

where the contractor suffered no economic burden

3

whatsoever.
HR. SMITH:

4

But again, Justice White, I don’t

5

think that we can — I don't think that we can assume

6

that the Federal — to assume that the Federal

7

Government will make that kind of reimbursement is in

8

effect to really, you know, make a farce of the Federal

9

Government’s immunity.

Because if you structure a

10

state's taxing statute on the assumption that the

11

Federal Government will make this contribution and

12

that’s the way we’re going to achieve equal treatment,

13

it seems to me that the immunity principle is seriously

14

threatened•
QUESTION:

15
16
17

It sounds a lot like your brief in

Fresno.
MR. SMITH:

No, I don't think it sounds like

18

my brief in Fresno, for one simple reason.

I think that

19

the Court will recall Fresno, in Fresno the principal

20

argument we made was that the tax on the Forest Ranger’s

21

possessory interest endangered and impaired the ability

22

of him to discharge his duties.

23

that there could be a segregation, a separation of his

24

private residential aspect, of his house, with the

25

Court's — you know, with the taxation of his axe, et

And the Court indicated

37

1

cetera, et cetera
So I think the cases are really quite

2
3

different.

4

something that it seems to us that the Court of Appeals

5

correctly identified as the appropriate rule on which to

6

invalidate this tax.

7

those who deal with the Federal Government differently

8

than those who deal with other parties, that that

9

difference in treatment triggers the kinds — the clash

10

of sovereigns that the supremacy clause was designed to

11

prevent.

12

But I think that the Fresno principle is

QUESTION:

That is, that you can't treat

Mr. Smith, before you leave Fresno,

13

I should have reread the case before today, but is it

14

not true that in the California possessory interest tax,

15

not only did the tax apply to tenants of all publicly

16

owned property, but to any property the owner of which

17

was tax exempt, such as charities?

18

class of properties?

19

MR. SMITH:

20

QUESTION:

21

Wasn't there a broad

I think that's right.
Doesn't that make it quite

different from this case?

22

MR. SMITH:

23

QUESTION:

I think it does.
But if you admit that, then what if

24

Washington were to amend its tax to take the approach it

25

now applies just to the Federal Government and create a

38

1

class of contracts including state agencies and the like

2

and treat them the way they now treat the Federal

3

Government?

4

Would that save it?

MR. SMITH*

Well, I'm not sure it would save

5

it, only because you then would have — you then have to

6

examine whether it included a sufficient number of

7

similarly situated constituents within the tax to

8

protect the Federal Government.

9

opinion — the dissenting opinion in Montana versus

In fact, the dissenting

10

United States really sort of raises that problem,

11

although it was —

12

QUESTION*

Well, yes, but —

13

MR. SMITH*

— talking about the merits, it

14

was talking about the merits of a case that the Court

15

never reached.

16
17
18

QUESTION*

So did the dissenting opinion in

Fresno, but it wasn't very persuasive.
MR. SMITH*

But let me simply say that I think

19

that when you're talking about who is a similarly

20

situated constituent you have to, I think, start from

21

the notion that the Federal Government is entitled to a

22

full measure of protection and the inclusion of all

23

similarly situated constituents.

24

think it would be — I would counsel against the Court

25

engaging in a kind of quantification of how much is

Because I don't — I

enough
It seems to us that the supremacy clause, if

2

3

it*s going to have any meaning, has to protect the

4

Government by — in other words, the notion should not

5

be that these people have sufficient political clout and

6

these — and that will carry the day, because those

7

things are terribly ephemeral.
I think from a constitutional point of view

8

9

the Federal Government has to be protected by including

10

all similarly situated people within the tax, and that

11

in our view here means the contractors, and that, the

12

absence of the contractors here which deal with the

13

State and with private parties, is glaringly absent.
If the State wants to return to 1935, we don’t

14
15

have any quarrel with that.

If it wants to impose a tax

16

based on the gross receipts of all contractors, James

17

versus Dravo Contracting Company establishes the

18

validity of that kind of tax.
But here we have a situation where the State

19
20

really wants to have it both ways.

21

enhanced tax revenue from the enhanced base in the

22

private sphere, but it also wants to catch the federal

23

contracts.

It wants its

QUESTION*

11

Hasn't Miller versus Milwaukee been

12

rather substantially limited by comments in later

13

opinions?
MR. SMITH;

14

I don't think it's been limited.

15

I think what the Court indicated was it still stands for

16

the important proposition that you can't discriminate

17

against the Federal Government and those with whom it

18

deals.

19

And in fact, Moses Lake Homes, it seems to us,

20

answers the very attempt of the state here to recast the

21

absolute immunity that the Court has never questioned in

22

terms of a no competitive disadvantage principle.

23

the Court will recall in Moses Lake Homes, a case which

24

also came from the State of Washington, the State of

25

Washington imposed a higher tax on federal lessees than

Without further discussion, the whole tax was invalid.

So we’re,not really — it seems to us it would
be wrong to demean the absolute immunity of the United

10

States from federal taxation and the anti-discrimination

11

principle which is part and parcel of that by saying

12

that somehow, as long as the Federal Government or

13

federal construction contracts bear the same cost in the

14

marketplace, that that’s sufficient, the Federal

15

Government simply is protected against paying any more.

16

In our view, the decisions of this Court

convincingly refute that kind of relegation of the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH 0. EIKENBERRY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS, WASHINGTON, ET AL.

5

MR. EIKENBERRY:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

We submit that the test which this Court may

apply in this case is inherent in the Fresno case and

the Detroit case, and I would state it as follows*

9

A

Federal Government where the same tax is imposed on

11

comparable nonfederal situations and transactions, where

12

the same tax on those dealing with the United States is

13

no greater than the tax on nonfederal transactions.

14

that's what we have here.

In fact, the Federal

17

This test provides the United States not being

18

placed at a competitive disadvantage in carrying out its

19

functions, and it provides that those who are similarly

20

situated in other transactions will be treated alike.

21

It ensures, we believe also, that there will be a

political check, because this broad class has been

created and the taxes will therefore not be raised

abusively.
