5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD W. HORNE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

6
7
8

MR. HORNEi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.

9

The issue in this case is whether Tennessee's

10

two-year statute of limitations governing paternity and

11

child support actions for illegitimate children violates

12

the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the

13

United States.

14

In Gomez v. Perez, this Court held that once a

15

state posits a judicially enforcable right of children

16

to support from their natural fathers, that the

17

Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the state from denying

18

the same right to illegitimate children.

19

Last year this Court, in the case of Mills v.

20

Habluetzel considered Texas's response to Gomez and

21

found that Texas's one year statute of limitations was

22

unconstitutional.

23

criteria, the first being that any period for obtaining

24

support must be sufficiently long in duration to present

25

a reasonable opportunity for those with an interest in

In Mills the Court considered two

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the child to assert the child's right to paternal

2

support and second, that any period of limitation on

3

that opportunity must be substantially related to the

4

state's interest in avoiding the litigation of stale and

5

fraudulent claims.
This Court found that in the Mills case, the

6
7

Mills statute, the one year statute of limitations

8

failed on both criteria.

9

applied in Texas's case applies in Tennessee's, or to

10

And the same reasoning which

Tennessee's two-year statute of limitations.
But in addition, in Tennessee, we have three

11
12

additional factors which further the conclusion that

13

Tennessee's two-year period of limitations is nothing

14

less than invidious discrimination toward illegitimate

15

children.

16

The first is that in Tennessee's two-year

17

statute of limitations the statute applies only to

18

illegitimate children who are not receiving support from

19

the state or who are not, in terms of the statute, a

20

public charge.

21

illegitimate child whose mother fails to file an action

22

before the child reaches his second birthday will find

23

his right to legitimation and to receive paternal

24

support forever terminated, unless the child sometime in

25

the future goes on welfare, receives AFDC or any other

Thus, a two-year, nonwelfare,

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

form of state assistance, and becomes a public charge,

2

at which time the statute which purportedly had run,

3

then terminates and the child can then, on behalf of any

4

person, have an action filed, or any person can file the

5

action on behalf of the child to seek the paternal

6

support.

7

Thus, the Tennessee legislature itself has

8

considered that claims involving paternity and paternal

9

support do not, in and of themselves, become stale prior

10
11

to 18 years, or the reign of 18 years.
The second item, and it comes out of a number

12

of cases this Court has previously decided, this Court

13

has held that involving the death of a father, that the

14

claim of a state or the right of a state to legislate

15

discriminatory treatment can be rationally related or

16

substantially related to the state's interest in the

17

orderly disposition of estates.

18

However, in Tennessee, were the defendant

19

Braxton Brown to die today,

young Pickett could go into

20

the Tennessee court and sue his father's estate and if

21

he could meet the heightened standard of proof, being

22

now more than preponderance of the evidence and less

23

than beyond a reasonable doubt, that his father had, in

24

fact, the defendant or the decedent was his father, he

25

could proceed -- could get a judgment and could be

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

allowed to receive part of his father's estate.
Now if the issue in today's case were the

2
3

right of young Pickett to proceed against a decedent's

4

estate, I would have to agree with the Court that

5

perhaps the claim could be stale and certainly would

6

possess the potential for being fraudulent, yet again,

7

the Tennessee legislature, or the Tennessee courts have

8

decided that the mere death of the father, of the

9

purported father, does not cause a claim to be stale or

i

10

so possessed with the problems of being fraudulent as to

11

terminate that cause or right of action.
Third additional consideration is that in

12

13

Tennessee the statute itself says that the purpose is to

14

provide for the support, education and welfare of

15

illegitimate children.

16

statute, they again say that the fathers are responsible

17

for the welfare and support of their illegitimate

18

children.

On the front end of Tennessee's

Now obviously, one of the purposes of this

19
20

statute is to prevent the liklihood that the

21

illegitimate child will be placed upon the — or placed

22

in need of support from the taxpayers of the state of

23

Tennessee.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Horne, why did the mother wait

so long in this case to bring her suit?

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

MR. HORNE;

You won't find it in the record.

2

Your Honor, because I didn't come into this case until

3

the statute of limitations issue has already been raised

4

and we went straight from that issue to the Supreme

5

Court, but in this case, Mrs. Pickett, when she became

6

pregnant was so embarrassed, she told me, that she

7

immediately left the town that she was living in,

8

Memphis, moved down into Mississippi with her child to

9

give birth in a community where nobody knew her and

10
11

where she could hide her shame.
She told me that she filed this lawsuit when

12

her child reached about nine years of age, he started

13

saying well, who's my father and how come I don’t have

14

his name and why isn't his name on my birth certificate

15

and it was at the request of her son that he be given an

16

opportunity to have his father’s name that she filed

17

this lawsuit.

18

QUESTION:

Is it your position that no statute

19

of limitations can be applied to an illegitimate child

20

during the minority for establishment of paternity?

21

MR. HORNE;

Well, certainly in Tennessee I

22

would agree that that is my position because of the

23

other factors, but I would argue, likewise, that in any

24

state irrespective of what factors were considered, that

25

there is no logical reason for denying an illegitimate

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

child the right to seek paternal support where the

2

legitimate child is provided that right.

3

further and say, if a state were to say, well,

4

legitimate children don't have the right to support from

5

their fathers, I wouli find constitutional flaw with

6

that argument as well.

7

QUESTION*

And I would go

Well, Mr. Horne, what about a state

8

which doesn't toll any statute during minority?

9

is, the statute runs against minors, not just on

That

10

legitimation claims, but on contract claims, tort claims

11

and the like.

12

MS. HORNE:

Well, I haven't given as much

13

consideration to that possibility as I have in this

14

case, but my initial reaction. Your Honor, is to say

15

that any statute of limitations which affects a child's

16

right to know his father, to have his father's name, the

17

name on the birth certificate, and the right to receive

18

support from both parents would be an unconstitutional

19

deprivation of both egual protection -- equal rights,

20

rather and due process.

21

QUESTION:

The reason, the only --

It wouldn't be a equal protection

22

violation, would it, if all causes of action of minors

23

are treated the same?

24
25

SR. HORNE:

I think it would, Your Honor,

because in the context of paternity, and let me say I'd

1

have more difficulty with it, it’s something I haven't

2

thought about in great depth, but in the context of

3

child support, the only purpose for which a state can

4

pass a limitations period on an illegitimate child’s

5

right to support wouli be the prevention of stale and

6

fraudulent claims.

7

I think that was the position taken by both

8

opinions in the Mill case.

And I see no potential for

9

stale claims, or I don’t see a child support claim

10

becoming stale during the minority of the child.

11

certainly doesn’t become stale for a child that’s

12

presumed to have a father.

13

It

One way of looking at it is this, perhaps.

If

14

a couple is married, and this happens all the time

15

nowadays, they get a divorce and the father’s trying to

16

avoid his obligation of support, he disclaims the child

17

and says this isn’t my child anyway, even though it was

18

born during the course of this marriage.

19

HLA blood test.

20

not the father.

21

He takes an

The blood test comes back and says he's

He then has a right to avoid the child support

22

obligation there.

23

by that process and if you have a period of limitations

24

on the child’s right to seek support from whoever his

25

true father turns out to be, you’ve afforded a man a

The child is, in essence, bastardized

1

right to avoid supporting his illegitimate children

2

without affording the illegitimate child an opportunity

3

to locate his real father and seek support from the real

4

father.
QUESTION;

5

Well, that's not an equal

6

protection claim, though, I wouldn't think.

7

any rate, does Tennessee have a general tolling statute

8

for causes of action accruing to minors until they come

9

of age?

10

MR. HORNE:

Yes, sir.

Well, at

Every action which a

11

minor child has during his minority is tolled for the

12

period of the minority plus the period of limitations

13

after the child reaches minority so that, in Tennessee,

14

this was going to get toward the end of my argument, but

15

the only action which is terminated for the illegitimate

16

child, or for any child rather, is the action of

17

paternity or seeking paternal support.

18

QUESTION:

What is the practice or law in

19

Tennessee regarding the leukocyte antigen test for

20

paternity actions?

21

MR. HORNE;

There is a bill presently before

22

the state legislature which I understand two weeks ago

23

made it out of committee to the floor, but has not been

24

passed yet, last I heard, which provides that the

25

Department of Human Services in contested paternity.

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

cases, is to provide to defendants an HLA blood test,

2

which would be paid for by the state initially, with

3

cost to be allocated based upon the abilities of the

4

parties to pay for it thereafter, and the results of the

5

blood test would be made admissible in the court

6

proceedings either to exclude paternity or to prove a

7

probability of paternity.
QUESTION;

8

9

Are those blood tests admissible

today in evidence in Tennessee?
MR. HORNE;

10

It is admissible to disprove

11

paternity.

It is not admissible to prove a likelihood

12

or plausibility of paternity.

13

Now Tennessee's statue -- two-year statute of

14

limitations, which purportedly has for its purpose, the

15

intent to prevent the child from becoming a public

16

charge to the state, actually has the reverse effect.

17

mother such as Miss Pickett, in this case, who finds

18

that her cause of action is terminated by the two-year

19

statute of limitations need only swallow her pride a

20

little bit and go down to the welfare office and apply

21

for state assistance to find that her child then has a

22

right.

23

a lawsuit and proceed for her child without a statute of

24

limitations.

25

A

The state will then pay for the litigation, file

So the effect is to encourage women who find

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that the statute has already run to place their children

2

on the welfare roles and seek additional support from

3

the state, which is the opposite intent of the statue.

4

The intent of the statute is to see to it that fathers

5

support their offspring.

6

The Tennessee Supreme Court's response to this

7

was also somewhat surprising.

Relying upon an old New

8

York case in the matter of Mores v. Feel, the

9

legislature — Tennessee Supreme Court, relying upon

10

their opinion, found that the legislature's only

11

interest was to see to it that some one person supported

12

an illegitimate child, as opposed to what the statute

13

purportedly claims on the front end, that there is an

14

intent that both parents should be equally responsible

15

for the support of their illegitimate offspring.

16

This amounts to an open declaration and

17

acknowledgment, I believe, of invidious discrimination

18

flying in the face of Gomez.

19

the one hand, well, both parents are responsible for the

20

support of their illegitimate children, but on the other

21

hand, illegitimate children must be supported only by

22

some one person, that's all we're really concerned

23

about, and if that one person can’t provide the support,

24

then we'll set the statute of limitations aside and

25

allow the state to proceed to litigate the claim.

Tennessee is saying, on

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

ifhat Tennessee, in reality, is saying is that

4

to do with it.

5

supremacy and I believe it's a throwback to the days

6

when state laws were made by male legislatures to and

7

for the protection of male legislatures.

The man didn't have anything

It's a blatant declaration of male

As I mentioned just a moment ago in response

8
9

Let her

to your question, and the same as in the Texas case,

10

Mills v. Habluetzel, in Tennessee this is the only cause

11

of action which is not tolled for the minor illegitimte

12

child.

13

period of limitations will be tolled and the child will

14

be allowed to proceed after it reaches its minority.

15

The only apparent answer then, I think, is

Every other cause of action will be — the

16

that in child support cases is concerned, and we've got

17

to ask that why is it only in child support cases that

18

we have the statute not tolled in Tennessee and I

19

believe the response is, it's the legislature's

20

intention to visit society's condemnation for the

21

illicit relationship outside the bonds of marriage upon

22

the child.

23

It's a statement of policy that we do not

24

approve of you fathering children, or mothering children

25

outside the bonds of wedlock and lacking an ability,

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 620-9300

1

perhaps, to punish either of the parents, the

2

legislature determined that it's the child that should

3

bear the brunt of society’s disapproval.

4

All considered, then,

I argue that the

5

two-year statute of limitations cannot be justified as

6

being substantially related to the state’s interest in

7

preventing stale and fraudulent claims and, in fact,

8

even under the reasonable relationship test, there is no

9

reasonable relationship — or reasonable support for the

10

argument that the two-year statute of limitations is

11

going to prevent stale or fraudulent claims.
One last point is that in a number of this

12

13

Court’s opinions, I’ve noticed references to a state has

14

a right to make some legislation to take care of the

15

problems, the difficult problems of proof in paternity

16

cases, I think that’s the way it’s referred to.

17

in the past five years, handled probably a little better

18

than 2,500 paternity cases and I’ve failed to understand

19

what the difficult problems in proof of paternity cases

20

is really referring to.

I’ve,

In those cases where we’re referring to the

21

22

purported father having passed away, I acknowledge that

23

there are some difficult problems of proof.

24

ought to be given an opportunity to come in and defend

25

himself.

But where the man is around, there is only two

2

people that know whether relations occurred.

3

man and the woman and they're always going to be around

4

in the context of the paternity case and it's the woman

5

who has to prove her case.

6

greater weight of the evidence that this man is the

7

father of the child.

8
9

It's the

She’s got to prove by the

If the passage of time is going to cause a
liklihood that witnesses have disappeared, memories have

10

faded, the same thing's going to happen to the woman.

11

And I've tried cases where 16 years after the birth of

12

the child, the woman gets up there, she can't remember

13

dates, times and places, and it affects her cases, it

14

affects her ability to carry the burden of proof and it

15

helps the defendant in his claim that he's not the

16

father of the child.

17

proof, I would argue, apply to the woman more than they

18

do to the man.

19

QUESTION:

So, the difficult problems of

Doesn't the legislature, quite

20

apart from the conduct of paternity suits, have an

21

interest, or isn't it legitimate for the legislature to

22

say we don't want that kind of a case to be tried 16

23

years after the events in which it happened.

24

Sure, it's going to hurt both parties, but the

25

judicial determination on the evidence 16 years later is

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

just not sufficiently reliable to allow the case to

2

proceed.

3

MR. HORNE:

Well, it would be as reliable and

4

actually, considering HLA blood testing nowadays, it

5

would be more reliable than an automobile accident or

6

contract case that was brought by the child 20 years

7

after the child was born.

8

limitations in those cases would be 18 years plus the

9

original period of limitations so the problem —

10

QUESTION*

Because the period of

That's an equal protection argument

11

and you may well be right on that, but I think a

12

legislature, or would you disagree with the observation

13

of a legislature, if it acted even-handedly, could say

14

that there are just some passages of time that are too

15

long to allow for an accurate determination of facts.

16

MR. HORNE:

I would have to agree with Your

17

Honor and make one exception and that’s because of the

16

statutory structure in Tennessee.

ig

having determined that it can be 18 years for a child

20

who is or is about to become a public charge is

21

determined at 18 years is not too long in Tennessee for

22

the prosecution of paternity claims.

23

The legislature,

If the statute had been written, much as the

24

Maryland statute was, I think at two years for a child,

25

well, two years is too short anyway, I'd argue, but

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

let’s say it was ten years for a child who is about to

2

become a public charge or who has never received

3

welfare, so it’s the same all the way across the board,

4

I think my argument would be more difficult,

5

I would still argue that ten years is too

6

short for the child, but Your Honor’s point is, on the

7

whole, accurate that a legislature does have a right to

8

determine what period of time is just too long for a

9

case to be prosecuted in the courts.

Mr. Horne, can I ask you a question?
Yes, sir.
Perhaps it’s not appropriate, but

The appellant's challenge to the

22

constitutionality of Tennessee’s paternity statute and

23

the two-year limitation limiting the opportunity to

24

establish the duty of the father to support illegitimate

25

children relies substantially upon this Court’s recent

The

Under Tennessee law, when a state statute is
challenged, a party is required to give notice to the

10

Attorney General and the Attorney General then has the

11

option of either defending the constitutionality of the

12

statute or certifying to the legislature that he cannot

13

so defend that statute.

14

We, of course, have chosen to defend the

15

constitutionality of this statute, because we believe

16

that, based upon this Court's analysis in Mills v.

17

Habluetzel, that it is, in fact, constitutional.

18

Last year, this Court considered a one-year

interests of minor plaintiffs by allowing them the

2

additional time within which to bring those actions.

3

QUESTION;

But I think perhaps that argument

4

was directed also to the independent right of the child

5

to bring an action for support, or does Tennessee law

6

recognize an independent action for the child?

7

flS. SHORT:

Under our paternity statute, Your

8

Honor, the action to establish support lies with the

9

mother, unless the mother is disabled or is deceased, at

10

which time, the action may be brought by the child

11

through a guardian or next friend or I would submit, if

12

the action is not brought on behalf of the child during

21

of the child.

QUESTION;

What if she may have a crush on the

father and doesn't anticipate he's going to be a good

boy after all and when he grows up he'll take care of

child and perhaps the mother's affections for that

father are that great you would think that he would also

than Texas.
MS. SHORT;

3

Perhaps so, Your Honor.

I was not

4

aware, based on this Court’s opinion in Kills, that the

5

child had the right to bring the action, but I assume

6

that that provision of the statute which allowed the

action to be brought by any person certainly could

include the child.

4

5

6

We

I believe the Tennessee statute, based upon

7

this Court's analysis in Hills, is reasonable.

In

8

Mills, this Court stated that procedures by which

9

illegitimate chili ran are afforded an opportunity to

10

obtain paternal support need not be coterminous with

11

those afforded legitimate children.

/

12

This Court held that limitations on paternity

13

actions would be upheld as constitutional if they are

14

sufficiently long in duration to afford persons with

15

valid claims a reasonable opportunity to assert them.

16

We believe that two years is a reasonable time.

17

Court addressed several concerns which were raised by

18

the Texas one-year limitation which we believe are

19

alleviated by the Tennessee two-year limitation.

20

This

Within two years, a woman is likely to have

situation reasonably and realistically.

2

face within one year after the birth of the child.

3

It's not unreasonable to assume that within

4

two years after the birth of the child the mother has

5

returned to work and can afford to seek legal advice

6

with respect to her responsibilities and obligations and

7

those of the father.

11

We also believe that two years is a reasonable
time within which to require the establishment of the
relationship of the father and the child.
I also believe that Tennessee's two-year

12

limitation addresses the practical obstacles which were

13

raised by this Court in the concurring opinion of

14

Justice O'Connor.

15

and psychological difficulties.

16

these are sufficiently alleviated by the two-year

17

limitation and the financial difficulties which were

18

raised by this Court.

These concerns included the emotional

MR. HORNE;

Respondent's last comment that it's not so

argument that this two-year statute, in Tennessee at any

be equally solved here by holding the Tennessee statute

MB. HORNE:

12

I don't think — the state has a

13

right to make a period of limitations and by the very

14

nature of a statute of limitations, the period is left

15

up to the discretion of the legislature and it is

16

arbitrary and capricious by its very nature.

appropriate for support cases, is entitled to make that

decision and I think the court's bound to stick by the

She’s not mature?

Your Honor, from the perspective
