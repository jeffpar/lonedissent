ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

HILLSBORO NATIONAL BANK

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:

9

The question presented in the Hillsboro

10 National Bank case is simply,
11

should payments made to

some of the bank's shareholders by a third party be

12 included in

the bank's income.

The facts underlying this case are these.

13

In

14

July of 1971 the Hillsboro National Bank paid the

15

personal property tax for all of its shareholders, all

16

1^9.

This was its custom for a number of years.

17 amount of the tax that was paid
18 approximately.

The

was $30,000,

It was paid out of the general funds of

19 the bank.
20
21

In the subsequent year, in its 1972 income tax
return, it took a deduction for the amount of the tax

22 that it had

paid.

23 the provisions of

This deduction was in accordance with
164(e) of the Internal Revenue Code.

it paid the tax it did not protest the

payment of these taxes, as was provided under the

1

Illinois statute/ nor a t any time thereafter did it ever

2

contest the validity of the personal property tax.
Prior to the time of the payment of the tax,

3
4

the people of the State of Illinois had adopted a

5

constitutional amendmen t that stated that individuals

6

should not pay ad valor em taxes on personal property

7

owned by them.

8

unconstitutional by the Illinois Supreme Court in July

9

of 1971.

This co nstitutional amendment was held

Consequently, in 1971 personal property taxes

10

were levied against ind ividual and corporate taxpayers.

11

Hillsboro National Bank and all the other citizens of

12 Illinois paid a persona 1 property tax.

This Court in 1973 reversed the Illinois

13

14 Supreme Court in the ca se of Lehnhausen versus Lake
15 Shore fluto Parts.

Now the question was presented to all

treasurers t hroughout the state*

16 the county

What do

17

they do with the money that was paid in 1972 for the

18

1971 taxes ?
The Illinois General Assembly had attempted to

19

20 solve the problem by pa ssing a piece of special
21

legislation which speci fically referred to tha pending

22 case in this Court, dir ected the county treasurers to
23 hold the

money in escro w, and following the decision in

24 this Court

to either di spense the money to the taxing

25 bodies or to

refund tha t money if the t; x was declared

This special act was enacted after the

3 Hillsboro. National Bank paid the tax.

It was not on the

4 books and did not exist at the time they paid the tax.
5

Some time during 1973 the Hillsboro National

6 Bank — excuse me -- the Montgomery County treasurer
7 decided that 132 of the 149 shareholders of the bank
8 were individuals and issued refund checks of the amount
9 of personal property tax directly to the shareholders.
10 They did not consult with the bank.

They did not even

11 advise the bank that they were making the refunds or to

12 whom or how they were made.
13
14 Court.

This brings us to the issue before this
Very simply, should these refunds to the 132

15 shareholders made by the county treasurer, totaling
16 approximately $26,000, be included in the 1973 income of
17 the Hillsboro National Bank.
18

2UESTI3N:

What about the corporate

19 shareholders?
20

MS. STEPHENS:

No, the money was delivered to

21 the taxing bodies becausa the corporate shareholders
22 were held to be liable for the tax.

So as far as

23 corporate shareholders, trusts, executors,

they made up

24 the other 17 shareholders in this case.
25

We are faced then with an application of the

1

The tax benefit rule is a judicially

tax benefit rule

2 created doctrine having its basis in equity and the
3 annual accounting principle.

Prior to this case, a case

4 before it in the Seventh Circuit called First Trust,
5 a case in the Sixth

and

Circuit of Tennessee-Carolina, all

6 of the cases involving the tax benefit rule had three
7 elements to them;

First of all, a deduction; secondly, a

8

9 deduction which results in a tax benefit to the
10 taxpayers; and
11

thirdly, in a subsequent year there is an

economic recovery which we believe has the effect for

12 tax

purposes of increasing the net worth.
The Commissioner now argues in this Court,

13
14 though,

that this third requirement, that is of an

15 economic recovery, should be ignored and we should
16 substitute a new element,

a rather ambiguously stated

17 argument, and I quote from his brief:
18 which the deduction
19

was taken is no longer valid."

In order to get to that result, he relies on

20 three earlier opinions of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES SILHASEK, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT BLISS DAIRY, INC-.

9
10

MR. SILHASEK;

Very well.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court;

11

As Mr. Stephens has set forth, the tax benefit

12

rule requires that an item properly offset against gross

13

income in determining the true liability for a

14

particular year is includable in the gross income when

15

it is recovered in a subsequent year.

16

are the three elements, that iss

17

previously deducted, that resulted in a tax benefit, and

18

it was subsequently recovered in a later year.

19

In effect, there

an item that was

The Government has sought to resurrect the

20 early applications of the tax benefit rule, which held
21

that an end of need constituted a recovery.

That rule

22 was laid to rest by this Court in the Nash decision.

As

23

such, an actual recovery is required for the application

24

of the tax benefit rule.

25

In the case involving Bliss Dairy, there was

10

The attempt to apply the tax benefit rule to a

6

7 liquidation under Sections 333 and 336 of the Internal
8

Revenue Code is not only prevented by the concise words

9 of the statute —
QUESTION;

10
11

Who got the benefit when the

corporation was liquidated?
MR. SILHASEK:

12

No one received the benefit,

13 Your Honor.
QUESTION;

14

Had this second event not occurred ,

15 would the stockholders have received more or less?
MR. SILHASEK:

16

It really, in this situation,

17 as 1*11 explain it, it really doesn't make that much
18 difference, because the stockholders, when they received
19 the assets, fair market value, the fact that it was
20 depreciated

or expensed made no difference to them.
Let me put the question another

Would the treatment of the stockholders have been

23 different?
24

MR. SILHASEK;

No, it would not have.

It

25 would not have been an expense, because their basis in

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the assets that they received/ for which they can

2 deduct, is determined by their basis in the stock they
3

had in the corporation.

It makes no difference as to

4 the fair market value of the asset or if it was expensed
5 by the corporation.
6

Again, it’s not only --

7

QUESTION;

8

Nr. Silhasek, I'd like to ask you,

if I may, what weight we should give to the failure of

9 the 94th Congress to enact a change to Section 1245 to
10

apply it to recapture of Section 162 expenses?
HR. SILHASEK:

11
12

They have had that opportunity,

and again, they have avoided it.

And just as recently

13 as last Thursday, the Chairman of the Senate Finance
14 Committee said he was going to propose more
15 legislation.

But they have had that opportunity on

16 several occasions and have not passed any legislation
17 that would have affected the outcome of this case.

QUESTION;

18

Should we give any weight to that,

19 one way or another?

NR. SILHASEK:

20
21

I believe so, because in

looking at the entire view of this transaction there

22 really is not an avoidance, a tax avoidance, or a
23 benefit that was recovered or recaptured by either
24 party.
25

In this particular case, the corporation made

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

purchases of cattle feed during its fiscal year ending

2

June 30#

1573.

The corporation, in accordance with the

3 cash method of accounting, properly deducted the amount
4 expended for the cattie feed as a business expense on
5 the tax return filed for that fiscal year.
During the next fiscal year, the corporation

6

7 adopted a plan of liquidation pursuant to the provisions
8 of Sections

9
10

333 and 336.

QUESTION:

Right away, at the beginning of the

next fiscal year?
MR. SILHASEKj

11

Yes, Your Honor.

Under 333,

12 when you adopt a plan, it has to adopt a plan of

13 liquidation and totally distribute its assets within a
14 30-day period.
QUESTION:

15

tfell, they did it right at the

16 beginning of the taxable year.
KR. SILHASEK:

17

Yes, Your Honor, they did,

18 although they purchased the feed -- that was expensed
19 throughout the taxable year.

It was not a purchase made

20 immediately before liquidation or anything of that
21

22

nature.
As a result of the plan, the corporation

23 distributed all of its assets to its shareholders in
24 redemption of all the stock issued and outstanding by
25 the corporation and went out of business.

Simply

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

stated, the corporation received no consideration upon

2

distribution of its assets to its shareholders upon

3

liquidation.

4

return for the distributed property, the value of which

The corporation only received its stock, in

5 upon the cessation of business and distribution of the
6

7

assets was nil.
There is no reason why the tax benefit rule

8 should override the specific language of the statute.
9

Section 336 of the Internal Revenue Code in effect

10

during the year in question specifically states that

11

there is no gain or loss recognized to a corporation cn

12

distribution of property in partial or complete

13 liquidation.
14
15

There are certain statutory excepts to the

statute, but none of them are applicable in this case.
The language and intent of the Congress is

16 clear with respect to this statute.

Congress has had,

17 as we mentioned, the opportunity to amend this statute
18 as recent as the enactment of the Tax Equity and Fiscal
19 Responsibility Act of
20

21

QUESTION;

1982.
Is there any doubt that what the

Internal Revenue Service has construed the statute

22 contrary to your submission?
23

MR. SILHASEK;

24

QUESTION;

Any doubt in my mind?

That they have been construing it

25 contrary to ycur submission?

14

HE. SILHASEKi

2

Not -- this is the first time

that this case has ever come up in this situation,

3 outside of Tennessee-Carolina, Your Honor.

They have

4 never attempted to apply the tax benefit rule in a 333
5 liquidation where there’s been a distribution of assets
6 to the shareholders that were subsequently expensed.

QUESTION

7
8

Well then,

this subsequent

Congressional history is irrelevant, too, then.
MS. SILHASEKs

9

They have attempted to apply

10

this in other types of liquidations, but they have had

11

this problem --

12

QUESTION;

So this is consistent.

This

13 position is consistent with their position in other
14 contexts.
15

KB. SILHASEK;

There are other cases.

They

16 have not reached the Court, Your Honor, but as the
17 Government said in their brief,

there are many cases

18 depending upon the outcome of this case.

So apparently

19 they have applied it in many cases that are not of
20 public record at this time.
21

QUESTION:

And you must convince us, to win,

22 that the statute just won't yield to this kind of

23 construction, that it’s just not within the realm of
24 statutory construction to apply it the way the Service

MR. SILHASEK;

2

QUESTION;

3

And I take it you think your case

is different from the one that was just argued?

4

MR. SILHASEK:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. SILHASEK:

7

That is correct. Your Honor.

Hillsboro?

Yes.
As far as — it's totally

different factually, but as far as the application of

8 the tax benefit rule it's the same, because there was nc
9

recovery in this situation.

There was a deduction,

10

there was a tax benefit, but the amount was never

11

recovered.

12
13
14
15

QUESTION:

But you’re relying on this being a

liquidation.
MR. SILHASEK:

Specifically on the statute,

yes, Your Honor.

16

QUESTION:

Which is different from Hillsboro.

17

MR. SILHASEK:

18

The Government has asserted that the

That’s correct. Your Honor.

19

non-application of the tax benefit rule in this

20

situation would result in a double deduction.

21

a complete view of the entire transaction clearly

However,

22 reflects that there was not a double deduction.
23

It is true that the feed was written off by

24

the corporation, with the writeoff equaling the amount

25

that the corporation paid for the feed.

In the

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 subsequent year a portion of that feel was distributed
2 to the shareholders in liquidation and the shareholders
3 received
4 had

a basis in that feed equal to the basis they

in the stock of the corporation.
QUESTION;

5

So it's just as though the

6 stockholders had bought the feed from them.
7

MR. SILHASEK;

8

QUESTION;

Similar to that, Your Honor.

If they'd have bought it -- suppose

9 this corporation hadn't gone out of existence,

but the

10 corporation had sold some feed to one of the
11 stockholders.
MR. SILHASEK:

12
13 the

If they had sold it to one of

stockholders, in that situation there possibly would

14 have been gain to the corporation.
QUESTION:

15

Possibly,

but there might not have

16 been, either.

17
18 fair,

MR. SILHASEK:

They would have had to pay a

a full -- the difference is, though, in purchasing

19 that feed they would have paid the full market value for
20 that feed.
21

QUESTION;

But the stockholders could have

22 deducted it.
23

MR. SILHASEK;

They could have deducted it,

24 but they would have paid substantially more, that is
25 correct.

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION

1

But they nevertheless have paid for

2 the feed by turning in their stock,

which was worth a

3 certain basis.

MR. SILHASEKs

4

That's correct.

The basis that

5 the shareholders received in the feed was not a
6 stepped-up basis,

that is stepped up to the fair market

7 value, but was the basis as it relates to the basis they
8 had

in their stock.

9 acquired a basis in

It is only by the fact that they
the feed that they were able to

10 deduct the stock.

It is not a situation where the fair market

11

12 value of an item is deducted once and then again the
13 fair market value of the item is deducted.

The second

14 deduction emanates from the fact that the shareholders
15 received a

new basis in the asset.
QUESTIONS

16

Do we know what that basis is?

17 There isn't anything in

MR. SILHASEFC;

18

the record on it, is there?
No, four Honor.

It was not a

19 stipulated fact.

QUESTIONS

That's correct, Yo ur Honor.

If that feed had been consumed

7

entirely in the prior year, what difference would it

8

have made to the stockholders on liquidation?

9

MR. SILHASEK:

It would have meant — probably

10

made no difference, because upon liquidation their basis

11

in the assets that they received is, they take the basis

12

in their stock and distribute it over the assets that

13

they received.

14

if they received a whole truckload, whatever their basis

15

in the stock was is distributed over those assets.

QUESTION;

Are you saying that the tax benefit

rule shouldn *t apply because there was no benefit?
MR. SILHASEK;

No benefit to the corporation

upon liquidation, that is correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

How about benefit to the tax — to

the stockholders?
MR. SILHASEK;

I see no benefit to them

23

either, because they would have written off — when they

24

received that feed, what they wrote off was the basis

25

they had in the stock.

It's similar to a reverse of

20

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

incorporation, where stockholders form a corporation.

2 They may put in assets that have a very low basis and

3 receive stock having a fair market value equal to the
4 fair market value of the assets that they use for
5 incorporation.
They recognize no gain at that time, even

6

7 though they have received something substantially
8

increased in value, and that's because of the statute

9 involved.
10 the
11

If they were to sell their stock, however,

basis in their stock is the same as the basis they

had in their assets.

Therefore, they would recognize

12 gain based on the difference between the fair market

13 value of the stock and the basis they had in the
14 assets .
15

As a part of the complete view of the

16 transaction, we should examine the statutory pattern of
17 a liquidation under Section 333.

Again, the purpose of

18 that statute was to allow people to disinvolve
19 themselves with the corporate entity.
20 corporation; to allow them
21

22

They had formed a

to get out of a corporation

by distribution of assets.
It must also be noted that there is a

23 possibility that they would not have received cash
24 sufficient to pay tax on any gain.

So what the statute

25 provides is that upon liquidation, under this type of

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

liquidation, they get the assets out even if they had

2 appreciate!

substantially in value, but the basis

3 remains the same as the basis they had in the stock.

So

4 if there's a subsequent sale, it is that time that the
5 gain is recognized upon the sale of those assets
6 received by the shareholders.

7

In our instance, these assets were of the type

8 that the shareholder could expense them rather than

9 having to sell them as if they were an asset that was
10 not
11
12

subiect to expensing, because of the type of

business they were engaged in.
Reliance by the Government on cases involving

13 liquidations under Sections 331 and 337 is misplaced
14 because those cases do not in fact involve the
15 application of the tax benefit rule to the liquidating
16 distribution.

They provide for the application of the

17 tax benefit rule to sales made by the corporation prior
18 to liquidation.
19

Under Section 337 there is no gain or loss on

20 sales or exchanges of corporate property that accrue
21

within a 12-month period following the adoption of a

22 plan for liquidation, but prior to the actual

23 liquidating distribution.
24

The courts have allowed the application of

25 this tax benefit rule or tax benefit principles even

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

though it is contrary to the specific language.

2 Basically/

I feel they have allowed it because of two

3

things:

One, there was an actual recovery in those

4

instances; Two, they have looked to the purpose of that

5

statutory language and held that the purpose of that

6

language was really to prevent the results that occurred

7

under the Court Holding case, rather than to override

8 any type of application of the tax benefit rule.

The cases of South Lake Farms and

9
10

Tennessee-Carolina involved liquidations wherein there

11

was a distribution rather than a sale of assets.

12

those cases involved similar factual situations, the

13

courts obviously reached a different result.

19 to expend $150,000 for feed and

then had simply given

20 some of it to the president of the corporation or to his
21

brother-in-law to use for their personal purposes, to

22 feed their personal cattle.

That would not have been

Does it make a difference to the Government which

yea r ?
MR. LEE;

7

The reason is,

and this goes.

8 Justice Blackmun, right to the heart of the tax benefit
9 rule,

the problem is the annual accounting concept that

10

was declared in 1931 by this Court in Sanford 8 Burnett

11

against Brooks, the notion that we do not assess tax on

12 the basis of

a transactional approach and wait until all

13 of the assets of the transaction have been finally
14 completed.
15 determine,

Rather, at the end of each year we
what are the income, what have been the

16 expenses,

and then assess the tax within that year.

17

In soma instances, however, it later develops

18 that deductions that were taken because of later events
19 we know were not in

fact deductions to that taxpayer.

20 If they occur within the same year, then both
21

transactions are a wash.

The later event simply nets

22 out the former.
23

The problem arises when you have a

24 circumstance where the later event occurs in a
25 subsequent year,

and that's where the tax benefit rule

Why is that a problem at all if the

3 statute of limitations hasn’t expired?
4 is a statement in your brief;

What bothers me

"The proper remedy for

5 taking account of such changed circumstances Is not to
6 amend or modify the original return, but rather to
7 reflect the change in the return covering the later
8

period."
Why is that so?
MR. LEE;

Well, in seme instances, as I

indicated -- in some instances, I suppose that that

would solve the problem.

QUESTION;

It seems to me again that what

15 you’re saying is that precision in annual accounting for
16 income tax purposes is a secondary consideration, not a
17 primary one.
18

MR. LEE;

Well, that is correct, and that what

19 is the primary purpose is determining -- but because of
20 the annual accounting concept, there are these later
21

balancing entries or correcting entries that may from

22 time to time be necessary.
23

Now, in the great majority of instances it is

24 true that there will in fact be a recovery, and the
25 later disproving event is in most instances accompanied

But that is purely fortuitous where it

because the recovery itself is really irrelevant

The reason that we have the rule is in order

2

Sew, let's take the Hillsboro facts and I

I assume that

4 no one would quarrel with the proposition that if all
5 the events had occurred in

1972 the bank would not have

6 been able to claim a deduction for state tax.

The bank

7 would have paid the money into the state treasury in
8 and

'72

the state would have paid it back to the

9 shareholders.

The dividend character of the

10 three-cornered transaction
11 established

is apparent and it is well

that dividend distributions are not

12 deductible.
13

The fact that the two events occurred in

14 separate years should not lead

to a different result.

15 In either case, we now know what we did not know in
16 1972, and that is that this is not something that the
17 bank owes and it is not a deductible item.

16

Well, that could be why this case

17

is different from the established and rule that you rely

18

on.

19

It coaid be.
MR. LEE;

Well, it is not double taxation in

20

this sense.

The bank in 1972 took a deduction for an

21

expenditure it was ultimately determined no one owed,

22 At the time — the triggering event that determined
23

it was no owed was the return of the money to the

24

shareholders.

25

that

The shareholders include that within their

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

taxable income and the bank, under the tax benefit rule

2 includes the amount of the earlier deduction within its

3 taxable income.
4

So that it's only double taxation in

the sense that there is a tax on the shareholders and

5 there is also a tax

on the bank.

6

But that would also be true in the event that

7

the bank simply declared a dividend on its earnings and

9 would then have a claim against whoever had stolen
10 them.

But the tax benefit rule still operates.

11

Mow, let me return to Justice Stevens'

12 question about Bliss Dairy.

Eliss purchased

13 approximately $150,000 worth of cattle feed and claimed
14 a deduction for the full $150,000, on the assumption

15 that the entire amount of feed would be consumed in its
16 business.
In fact, it was not.

17

The reason was, Eliss

18 used only $94,000 worth of the feed in its business
19 because it went out of business before it used all the

20 feed.

We now know what we did not know at the end of

21 fiscal 1973, and that is that Bliss* feed expense, Bliss
22 as a corporation, feed expense for

1973 was not

23 $150,000, it was $94,000.
24
25 Mr.

Sow, I need to make two points.

The first is,

Silhasek is right when he says that there was an

allocation of the basis, the shareholders* basis in

2

their stock., among the various assets.

3

indication in this record as to how much of that basis

4

went to the feed, though that I think is immaterial.

5

The crucial point,

6

that insofar as the feed itself is concerned there was a

7

stepped-up basis and that is undeniable.

8

feed is concerned, the corporation paid for it once and

9

the corporation and the sha reholde rs deducted it twice.

stepped-down basis -- your theory would be precisely the

same?

MR. LEE:

Bliss'

1

argument is that once it decided to terminate its

2 business it distributed all of its assets, including the
3 unconsumed feed,

to its shareholders in a liquidating

4 transaction governed by Section

336 cf the Code, which

5 provides that no gain or loss shall be

recognized to a

6 corporation on the distribution of property in partial
7 or complete liquidation.

And Bliss' argument is that

8 this statute precludes the application of the tax
9 benefit rule.

The fallacy in that argument is that the gain

10
11

which Section 336 immunizes is a gain from the sale of

12 appreciated assets and,

But more than

5 that, we also have two companion provisions, Sections

The sole purpose,

7 lawyer acknowledges, for the adoption of Section 337 was
8 to prevent inconsistencies that would otherwise come
9 into transactions that are governed by Sections 336 and
10 337, that is those in which pursuant to a corporate
11 liquidation the sale of assets is made either by the
12 corporation or by the shareholders.

It was to eliminate

13 that inconsistency that Section 337 was adopted.
14

It is well settled that, notwithstanding the

15 clear no-gain language of Section 337, the tax benefit
16 law applies.

If Bliss Dairy were to win this case, so

17 that the tax benefit rule were not applicable to Section
18 336 provisions -- transactions -- but were applicable to
