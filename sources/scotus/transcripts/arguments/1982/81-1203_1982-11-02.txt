You didn't put in the word

MR.

The issue is arbitration provided

by both the federal act and the state act.

But your position would be that the

consequence is the same in terms of enforcing

wouldn't it?

MR. FLOYD:

Unless the Federal Arbitration Act

applies.

4

QUESTION:

I just said the only thing it said

5

— my question u/as if they sued him in state court for

6

an order to arbitrate» that's all» to enforce the

7

contract, it would be a state law question.

8

QUESTION:

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. FLOYD:

Don't answer that too quickly.

I think my answer is yes, it would

11

be a state law question, and the Federal Arbitration Act

12

is a part of the law of the state of North Carolina.

13

QUESTION;

Okay, but if you sue under the

14

Federal Arbitration Act, then whether or not the

15

construction of the contract is to be decided by federal

16

law or by state law?

17

MR. FLOYD:

18

question.

MR. FLOYD:

QUESTION:

I have trouble answering the

You should.
In that the construction —
You should have trouble, and you

shouidn't hurry.

QUESTION:

Is it your position that the state

24

courts are obliged to enforce the Federal Arbitration

25

Act in this setting?

1

MR. FLOYD:

2

QUESTION:

3

Absolutely, Your Honor.
So to that extent there is a

federal statutory question involved.

4

MR. FLOYD:

There is a federal statutory

5

question involved.

6

Federal Arbitration Act which the North Carolina Supreme

7

Court has held is a part of the law of North Carolina

8

under the supremacy clause and must be enforced as any

9

other part of the law of North Carolina would be

10

The federal statute involved is the

enf orced .
So the dichotomy between federal and state law

11
12

is confusing in the circumstances.

13

always held that the Federal — the supremacy clause

14

requires enforcement.

15

Carolina Court of Appeals case was not that at all; it

16

was an interprstation of the commerce clause, which was

17

too narrow and overruled ultimately in the Schafer

18

Partnership case in the North Carolina Supreme Court.

Higher courts have

The question under the North

The next question involved, and just as

19

20

important as that one, in my view, is how and when the

21

federal appeals courts may review the exercise of the

22

district judge's discretion.
QUESTI3N:

23

That really is preliminary in any

24

analytical sense to the Arbitration Act question, isn't

25

it?

Because if this question wasn't properly in the

MR. FLOYD:

It is jurisdictional in the court

6

So analytically I think that is the first

The facts giving rise to these questions are

Greensboro against two defendants.

First u»as Mercury

Construction Corporation, an Alabama corporation; and

11

second was J.N. Pease & Associates, a North Carolina

13

The complaint filed in the Superior Court in

North Carolina alleged that some months earlier, Mercury

15

had delivered to Pease, the architect, a document

entitled Claim for Equitable Adjustment of Contract

18

against the hospital.

QUESTION;

All right.

On that one, it would

be a question of state law.

5

QUESTION:

Well» it may be that federal courts

6

can enforce promises to aribitrate under the Arbitration

Act» but that doesn't mean that whether they're

8

arbitrable or not is a matter of federal lau».

9

MR. FLOYD:

They cannot enforce such contracts

10

absent diversity and amount in controversy requirements

11

of the diversity statute.

12

enforcement of arbitration» under the federal act»

13

contemplates in its genesis that it will be enforced by

14

state courts simply because there is no jurisdiction

15

given to the federal courts except in diversity cases*

16

if you've got a commerce clause kind of contract as

17

opposed to a maritime kind of contract.

18

The federal scheme for

So the scheme in the beginning is that who

19

shall enforce arbitration» it must be both federal and

20

state courts because the federal courts are not given

21

jurisdiction or an independent basis of jurisdiction.

22

Therefore» several of the circuits have held there is no

federal auestion jurisdiction under the Federal

Arbitration Act.

whether you apply the Uniform Arbitration Act in effect

about a contract otherwise in commerce.

QUESTION;

Yes.
And therefore* the previsions of
Any provision of state law not

How

do you know whether it's

compatible with the federal act or not?
MR. FLOYD;

11

Wall, if the federal act says go

12

arbitrate and the state law says you don't have to for

13

whatever reason in this case, then my answer is you go

14

arbitrate because the federal law is supreme.
QUESTION;

15

Then, Mr. rloyd, are you saying

16

that in this case, — under Section 4 of the federal

17

statute, as I read it, there are only two issues; one,

18

was there a contract containing an aribtration clause,

19

and I guess that's not in dispute, is it?
MR. FLOYD;

20
21

22

There is no dispute about the

contract.
QUESTION;

And the second issue is did one of

the parties refuse to arbitrate, and I guess that's not

That's correct.

To say I agree to

arbitrate does not mean that I agree to arbitrate every

8

are clear that if we deal with an antitrust case,

Your Honor, as the Federal

5

Arbitration Act.

6

QUESTION;

Well, that may be so, but is it a

7

body of federal law interpreting contracts that

8

otherwise would be governed by state law?

9

MR. GAEDE;

It is a body of law for

10

interpreting the enforceability of arbitration

11

agreements.

If, for example, Justice White, —

12

QUESTION;

But if it's an agreement.

13

QUESTION;

Maybe that's —

14

MR. GAEDE;

I can agree with you very easily,

15

Your Honor, that if it says disputes involving X are not

16

subject to arbitration, then clearly, there's no

17

agreement to arbitrate.

18

if the arbitration clause says this clause is applicable

19

only to disputes A, 5, C and 0, then that is —

20

QUESTION;

No one would dispute that.

And

But if the contract says X disputes

21

are subject to arbitration and Y disputes are not, but

22

then there's an argument about whether it's X or Y, what

Isn't that a contract question?
That would be a contract question.
Then where did you get federal

8

substantive law of contracts, which is the answer you

9

just gave.

10

MR. GAEDE:

There are certain situations where

11

federal courts have, in effect, adooted a federal

12

substantive law of contracts.

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Well* what cases from this Court

support that in this particular situation?
MR. GAEDE:

In this particular situation I

16

think the Prima Paint case —

17

QUESTION:

I thought Prima didn't address that

18

question as to what law would govern if you were trying

19

to determine whether or not the dispute between the

20

parties was arbitrable.

21

22
23

QUESTION:

That was conceded it was arbitrable

in Prima Paint.
MR. GAEDE:

I have to -- I will agree* Your

24

Honor, that Prima Paint did not cieal directly with that

25

question, but I think the fair inference from Prima

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Print is that that mould be the result.
QUESTION:

2

Weil, if it was conceded that it

3

was arbitrable, Prima Paint didn't hav to decide that

4

question.

MR. GAECE:

5

6
7

Isn't that correct?
That is certainly correct, yes,

sir.
To try to return to what I think is the

8

central point on this part of the case, Congress in its

9

wisdom gave to parties to agreements to arbitrate the

10

right to go into federal court and to have a hearing.

11

And if based on that hearing the federal court was

12

obligated — if it found that there was an agreement to

13

arbitrate and if it found that there was a failure to

14

comply, to compel arbitration.

15

If this Court has a serious question about

16

whether or not there was an agreement to arbitrate,

17

which we don't think there was — the Fourth Circuit

18

certainly didn't have any problem with that — but if

19

that is a question, then the proper remedy would be to

20

remand the case to the state court and direct that the

21

state court hold a hearing on that question — I mean,

22

to the federal court — and direct the federal court to

23

hold a hearing on that question.

Your Honor, I think not for

several reasons.

12

federal courts are far more familiar with the

13

interpretation and enforcement of the Federal

14

Arbitration Act.

15

granted right to a hearing in the federal courts on that

16

3

that is very important in this case.

4

QUESTION;

And me think

The question here is not embraced

5

in the proposition that there's an agreement to

6

arbitrate.

Everyone concedes there's an agreement to

7

arbitrate.

The question is to arbitrate what, and that

8

issue arises under a contract which is a matter of state

9

law» is it not?

The interpretation of the contract is a

10

matter of state law.

11

MR. GAEDE;

12

QUESTION;

Yes* Your Honor* I agree with that.
And isn't the state court better

13

able to do that than to have a federal court do it under

14

a diversity route?

15

MR. GAEDE;

16

QUESTION;

17

I don't believe so* Your Honor.
And that's what the district court

did decide* didn't he?
MR. GAEDE;

18

I think the district court in this

19

case* in a sense, abdicated its responsibility.

20

the district court came close to the situation in

21

The.rmtron* in this case, quite frankly, because you had

22

a situation where the court was obligated to proceed

23

forward.

24
25

I think

Section 4 is written in very mandatory terms,
Mr. Chief Justice, and we feel as though the district

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

court was obligated to go forward.
Let me point out one thing if I might.

In the

3

record» it is very clear in the affidavits that were

4

filed by our client to the district court* it is clear

5

that the contractor went to the architect during the

6

course of construction and said u»e will have claims* and

7

the architect said, we understand you will have claims,

8

and we request that you withhold the filing of those

9

claims until after construction is completed.

10
11

That is

undisputed in the record.
Now* under those circumstances, I think that

12

renders the kind of argument that Mr. Floyd is making

13

meaningless.

14

condition precedent argument in this case.

16

I don't agree with his argument to start

QUESTION:

Well, only part of it I think,

17

because one branch of his argument is that it's not ripe

for arbitration until it's been submitted to the

19

architect and passed on by the architect.

20

after that that you can submit it for arbitration.

21

MR. GAEDE:

Your Honor, in the record, there's

22

also an affidavit by the architect which says if he had

In this situation* as I said, Mercury had

notified the architect of the claims and had been

advised to hold off.

We did.

We then gave the hospital

As the record will show, and as the

13

was a week off, we called to confirm the meeting, the

hospital said well, we'll call you back in a few days

we're filing a lawsuit against you tomorrow in state

Mr. Floyd in his argument said that we waited

3

for three weeks to proceed with our Section 4 petition.

4

He's right, we did wait for three weeks, and the reason

5

we u/aited for three weeks was that the hospital went to

6

the state court ex parte without notice to us and

7

obtained an injunction from a North Carolina court

8

enjoining our client from seeking to enforce its rights

9

to arbitration.
We had that decision set aside on the basis of

10
11

this Court's decisions in Atomic General and other

12

cases, Donovan and Atomic General.

proceeded to file our Section 4 petition.

And than immediately

14

What happened when the district court stayed

15

the Section 4 petition was that he, in effect, finally

16

determined that my client would not be entitled to the

17

hearing that Congress had guaranteed it under Section 4

18

of the Act.
QUESTION;

19

Are you saying that the district

20

court, in entering that order, ruled out the possibility

21

that if after three months you could ghow that there was

22

simply no progress made in the state court and that your

23

opponent was blocking normal process, that the district

24

court might not entertain an application to lift the

25

stay?

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

MR. 3A50Ei

Your Honor, I suppose that it is

2

conceivable that the state court could have done nothing

3

whatsoever and that we would have attempted to come back

4

in and have the stay lifted.

5

possible that the state court could have ruled that the

6

Federal Arbitration Act didn't apply, and that u/e could

7

have tried to come back in and have the stay lifted.

I also assume that it's

8

3ut I think that those are tu/o fairly extreme

9

circumstances, and certainly as a practical matter — I

10

think the Fourth Circuit was right that as a practical

11

matter, assuming that the state court is going to move

12

with any kind of dispatch, that what has really happened

13

is that the federal court has denied us the right to

14

have our Section 4 right enforced in the federal court.
I can conceive of examples of where that

15
16

wouldn't happen, but I think as a practical matter,

17

Justica Rehnquist, that belies the reality of the

18

situation.

19

this point.

And I might point out two other things at

20

Cne is that the stay order did not say I am

21

staying the Section 4 case pending a determination of

22

the question as to arbitrability.

23

the Section 4 case pending a determination of the entire

24

case pending in a North Carolina court.

The second thing is that at the time the

2

affidavits that had been filed on the issue o*

3

arbitration under Section 4, uihich is the normal may in

4

my experience that that issue is dealt with.

5

issue had been fully briefed.

6

such briefing had taken place in the state court.

7

Ana the

No such affidavits and no

So at that particular point in time, more

8

activity had occurred in the district court, the federal

9

district court, than had occurred in the state court.

10

And, as a matter of fact, as the Fourth Circuit found,

11

the district court had before it all the information

12

that it needed or mas necessary to make an order that

13

our client uias entitled to arbitration and that the

14

district court should have compelled arbitration.
QUESTION:

16

contracts matters of timeliness, waiver and latches are

matters for a court to decide.

18

compel arbitration and the defendant says well, you've

19

waived it or it's untimely or the demand is untimely or

20

there've been latches or something.

Yes.
The state lair must decide it as a

federal matter.
MR. GAEOES

Yes» Your Honor.

And I believe

10

that the circuit courts of appeals decisions and almost

11

every final state court that has ultimately reached that

12

question are consistent in that regard.

13
14

QUESTION:

But is that an issue that's

normally decided by the court or by the abitrator?
MR. GAEDE:

That's an issue that's almost,

without fail, decided by the arbitrators.
QUESTION:

18

the arbitrator.

The federal rule is that issues such as

that shall be decided by the arbitrator.

QUESTION:

That is correct, sir.
And that that prevails over any

22

contrary state rule where there's a demand for

arbitration.

24
25

MR. GAEDE:

Yes, Your Honor.

As long as the

contract in which the arbitration clause is contained is

Federal Arbitration Act.

3

QUESTION;

Yes, I understand that.

Obviously*

4

that has to be present or the federal law doesn't apply

5

at all.

6
7

MR. GAEOE;

That's a

necessary predicate to proceeding.

8

9

That is correct.

If I could* I would like to turn for a minute
to the question of appealability under Section 1291.

As

10

I said in my answer to Justice Rehnquist's questions* I

11

believe that as a practical matter, and looking at the

12

realities of the situation, the district court's stay

13

order effectively terminated our client's petition under

14

Section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act to compel

15

arbitration and.denied us the right to a hearing on that

16

petition.

17

In so holding, the Fourth Circuit, in our

18

view, followed the rule of this Court that has been

19

applied for many years, and that is that finality is to

20

be given a practical rather than a technical

21

construction.

22

The underpinning or the basis for the finality

23

rule, as stated in the decisions of this Court, is that

24

you will not have piecemeal reviews.

25

during the process of a case.

Piecemeal reviews

Not piecemeal litigation,

2

but a piecemeal review in the case that we're talking

about.

In this situation» the order that was entered

by the district court effectively stopped that case

6

forever.

I might add that North Carolina, after this
case tuas decided by the district court, did enter a case
that said the Federal Arbitration Act mould be the lam
of that state, but there are other states at this time
that do not do that.

As a matter of fact, my omn state

of Alabama does not recognize it right nom, and the
Supreme Court of Minnesota, in a recent case decided
this summer, the Thayer case, has held that the Federal
Arbitration Act is not to apply even though commerce mas
admitted in that case.
So, I think rne've got a mixed bag of mays in
mhich states might or might not rule on these auestions,
and me think it is very important if arbitration is to
become a meaningful may to deal mith disputes,

15

commercial disputes, that it is very important that to

16

the extent possible and to the extent that jurisdiction

17

is granted to them, that the federal courts deal mith

18

arbitration questions and develop a body of lam that

19

mill be uniform and mill put some meaning out of mhat,

quite frankly, nom, in many situations, is chaos.
