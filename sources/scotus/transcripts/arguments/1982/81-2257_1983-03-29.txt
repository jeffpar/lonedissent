ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE ALLEN KATZ, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. KATZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, the issue before the Court in this

11

case is the extent to which restraints should be placed

12

upon the power of the National Labor Relations Board to

13

interfere with civil proceedings instituted in state

14

court and growing out of a labor dispute.

15

The civil litigation in this case was a suit

16

filed in the Arizona Superior Court by petitioner, Bill

17

Johnson's Restaurants, against several persons who were

18

demonstrating in front of the restaurant in September,

19

1978.

20

the restaurant by publishing leaflets which accused the

21

restaurant in engaging in a refusal to pay lawful

22

overtime, in sexually harassing waitresses, in

23

discharging a waitress for union activity, and

24

maintaining filthy restrooms.

25

The suit alleged that the protesters had defamed

The suit also asked for injunctive relief and

1

for damages for misconduct occurring during the

2

demonstrations.

3

some controversies arising out of labor disputes are so

4

deeply rooted in matters of local concern and

5

responsibility that the state courts have primary

6

jurisdiction to hear and determine these controveries

7

even though they may touch on matters of federal concern

8

as well, and I refer here to suits growing out of labor

9

controversies involving defamation, involving violence,

This Court has held in the past that

10

involving trespass and other torts out of such labor

11

disputes where the public peace and orier are

12

threatened.

13

In these cases, the state has been held to

14

have an overriding interest in the resolution of the

15

controversy.

16

Relations Board has in the present case ordered the

17

restaurant to withdraw its civil suit and to compensate

18

the defendants for all expenses incurred by them in the

19

defense of the suit, including expenses incurred by them

20

in the prosecution of their counterclaims.

21

Despite this history, the National Labor

The Board does not justify its order in this

22

case by any finding that the complaint filed by the

23

restaurant on its face asked for relief barred by the

24

National Labor Relations Act.

1

complaint filed by the restaurant was pre-empted by the

2

National Labor Relations Act, or that it raised issues

3

that were already pending before the Board.

4

Instead, the Board attempts to justify its

5

intrusion into the parties* civil litigation by a

6

finding that the restaurant’s suit constituted an effort

7

to retaliate against those demonstrators who were

8

outside its premises.

9

performed adjudicatory responsibilities that should have

To reach that result, the Board

been performed by the state court.

11

After the restaurant filed its suit, the Board

12

compelled the restaurant to demonstrate that the suit

13

had some reasonable factual basis, that it had merit.

14

Considerable evidence was presented before the Board’s

15

Administrative Law Judge on the same questions that were

16

then pending in front of the state trial court.

17

example, were the offensive statements of the

18

demonstrators true or false?

20

false?

ME. KATZ;

Questions of defamation arising out

of a labor dispute are questions of state law.

state court.

The

Are you saying that the

6

Administrative Law Judge examined issues that were

7

concededly of state law, such as whether there was a

8

publication under the Arizona law of libel?

9

MR. KATZs

The question of whether there was a

10

publication was not at issue, but other questions

11

decided by the Administrative Law Judge, Justice

12

Rehnquist, were in fact then pending before the state

13

court.

For example, were the —

The Administrative Law Judge determined — The

Administrative Law Judge determined that in fact the

1

statements on the relief work, were truthful, and in fact

2

the demonstrators had not engaged in obstructions or

3

intereference with restaurant property, and that in fact

4

the restaurant’s lawsuit lacked a reasonable basis, and

5

his interpretation had to be one of state law, because

6

the issue was one of state law.

7

QUESTIONS

The Board —

Mr. Katz, would you concede that

8

perhaps the National Labor Relations Board, through its

9

Administrative Law Judge, could still consider issues

10

relating to whether it’s an unfair labor practice here

11

to have filed the state suit at least for purposes of

12

giving other remedial relief other than the cease and

13

desist order, for example, reguiring payment of costs of

14

suit?

15

MR. KATZs

Justice O'Connor, I would say that

16

the responsibility of the National Labor Relations Board

17

in that circumstance would be to wait until the state

18

court had issued its determination on the merits of the

19

lawsuit.

20

to issue sufficient relief to protect the federal rights

21

that were then at issue, or to protect the rights of

22

employees under the National Labor Relations Act, the

23

Board certainly had the opportunity to take another look

24

at the unfair labor practice charge that was in front of

25

it and to determine whether the interests of the

At that point, if the state court had failed

7

1

National Labor Relations Act required supplemental

2

relief to be ordered.

3

QUESTION:

What do you see in the Act that

4

would affect the timing of the Board’s jurisdiction in

5

that regard?

6

MR. KATZj

If I understand your question,

7

Justice O’Connor, Section 10(j) of the Act would allow

8

the National Labor Relations Board to file a petition

9

with the United States District Court in order to

10

protect the interests of the Act and the interests of

11

employees against any direct infringement that might

12

occur during the prosecution of that suit.

13

For example, if the plaintiff in such a state

14

suit engaged in discovery which the Board determined

15

might have an adverse impact on a proceeding then

16

pending before the Board, it is arguable that the Board

17

could apply under Section 10(j)

18

District Court and obtain an appropriately limited

19

injunction.

20

to the United States

In this case, the Board might well have been
able to do that, but instead —
QUESTION;

That’s an exception to the

Anti-Injunction Act —
MR. KATZ;

Yes, Your Honor.

That would be an

exception to the Anti-Injunction Act, and this Court has

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

recognized two or three exceptions to the

2

Anti-Injunction Act in the past, and I think-one of them

3

would be applicable in this case, and that is, when the

4

Board has to act in aid of its own jurisdiction.

5

If there is an issue pending before the Board

6

which has also been raised before the state court, or if

7

the proceedings in the state court threaten to impact

8

directly on the proceedings before the National Labor

9

Relations Board, that, I believe, is what Congress

10

intended Section 10(j) of the National Labor Relations

11

Act to be used for,

12

District Court and petition for appropriate limited

13

injunctive relief.

14

and the Board could go into the

In this case, the Board did not seek an

15

appropriate limited injunction from the District Court.

16

The Board petitioned the District Court under Section

17

10(j) for an injunction restraining the entire lawsuit

18

that had been filed in the state court.

19

QUESTION:

What if the Board had limited its

20

relief to an order that court costs or legal fees be

21

paid?

22

23

MR. KATZ.*

While the state court suit was

still pending?

24

QUESTION;

Right.

25

MR. KATZ:

I think that would be an

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

unwarranted infringement on the state suit.

2

remedy that would come out of the state proceeding was

3

within the original primary jurisdiction of the state

4

court, and the Board could only interfere with that

5

proceeding to the extent that there was a direct impact

6

on a matter pending then before the Board.

I think any

7

In this case, there was no such finding.

8

QUESTION*

9

You are saying, I take it, that the

statute, the federal statute, 2283, I think, has not

10

expressly authorized this kind of restraint to be put on

11

the Board.

12

MR. KATZ;

It has not.

13

QUESTION*

What is the scope of the

14

Administrative Law Judge’s inquiry to determine whether

15

there is harassment that would interfere with the

16

Board’s jurisdiction?

17

MR. KATZ*

I think that if the civil suit on

18

its face were to allege a cause of action barred by the

19

National Labor Relations Act, then the Administrative

20

Law Judge arguably would have authority to take action

21

and perhaps that might include even the restraint of

22

that suit.

23

case and the 1972 Textile Workers case, in which unions

24

had allegedly violated the Act by seeking to impose

25

fines on employees who had engaged in conduct that was

I think, for example, of the 1970 Machinists

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

against the union constitution, but the conduct had been

2

engaged in after the employees had resigned from the

3

union.

4

Such a complaint may well state a cause of

5

action barred by the National Labor Relations Act, and

6

in those cases the Board held an unfair labor practice

7

had occurred, and the Board enjoined the state court

8

action to enforce the fines.

9

our case, because the state court complaint filed in

That, of course, is not

10

this case did not allege a cause of action barred by the

11

National Labor Relations Act or pre-empted by the

12

National Labor Relations Act.

13

QUESTION*

Counsel, I think you mentioned that

14

the regional director filed a petition with the Federal

15

District Court seeking to enjoin the entire state

16

action.

17

MR. KATZ*

Yes, Justice Powell.

18

QUESTION;

I don't think you have stated the

19

result of that.
MR. KATZ:

20

The result of it was that the

21

Federal District Court refused to issue the order

22

requested by the Board.

as Appendix C are the findings of fact and conclusions

5

of law of the District Court.

6

Your Honor will refer to Exhibit B attached to our

7

brief, which is a selection from the transcript of

8

proceedings before the District Court, District Judge

9

Crane did suggest to the Board that he would be willing

I might point out, if

10

to consider an order enjoining the respondent from

11

interfering with proceedings before the Board, but the

12

Board did not pick up on that suggestion, and did not

13

ask for any more limited injunction.

14

only for the complete restraining order against the —

Powell asked?

QUESTION:

So what was his reason for denying

MR. KATZ:

produced by the Board to indicate that the state court

occurred in the filing of the state suit.

He found no basis for

QUESTION:

Was any appeal taken from that?

5

MR. KATZ:

There was an appeal initially

6

taken.

That is not part of the record before the

7

Court.

It was later withdrawn.

8
9

QUESTION:

Could I ask you, how do you read

the National Labor Relations Board views in this case?

10

In order to make out the unfair labor practice which

11

they found, according to them, is it necessary to prove

12

not only an anti-union bias or a harassment, but also

13

that the action have no basis?

14
15
16

MR. KATZ:

It is difficult to read the

National Labor Relations Board, because —
QUESTION:

I know what the Administrative Law

17

Judge said, but I don't read the Board as relying on

18

that other factor at all, just a finding that the suit

19

was motivated by an anti-union bias or by retaliation.

20

MR. KATZ:

I read the Board's papers filed in

21

this Court as taking the position that if the suit is

22

motivated by the desire to retaliate, it is an unfair

23

labor practice.

24

QUESTION:

That is the end of it.

25

MR. KATZ:

Yes, sir.

QUESTION;

Whether the suit has any foundation

or not.

to determine whether it has a foundation in fact —

that it does have a foundation in fact.

still find an unfair labor practice.

9
10

MR. KATZ;

The Board would

I think that's a fair conclusion

from the position the Board has taken.

11

QUESTION;

I don't think that’s true of what

12

the Court of Appeals said in reviewing the Board

13

though.

14

MR. KATZs

The Court of Appeals indicated that

15

even in the absence of an unlawful motivation, a suit

10

which had a coercive impact on employees might well be a

17

violation of Section 81.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

I know, but they would require that

the suit have no basis.
MR. KATZ:

That’s not — well, yes, I think

21

I'd have to concede that.

The Court of Appeals would

22

require the suit have no basis.

23

Board would do that.

It is not clear the

24

The Ninth Circuit held that the restaurants

25

also had a lawful objective on its face, and then the

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Ninth Circuit went on to say that the proper test of the

2

legitimacy of a state cause of action is whether the

3

plaintiff has evidence to support his allegations.

4

we agree with that holding, but we disagree with the

5

Ninth Circuit as to the appropriate forum in which such

6

evidence should be tested.

7

Now,

Simply put, our position is that the NLRB is

8

not entitled to adjudicate or to restrain a pending

9

state court lawsuit which has a lawful objective on its

10

face and its properly subject to state court

11

jurisdiction.

12

might be some situations in which the state court suit

13

asks for relief barred by the National Labor Relations

14

Act.

15

right to restraint that suit, but in so considering, the

16

Board might take into account the motive for filing the

17

suit.

I pointed out a moment ago that there

In such a case, the Board might arguably have the

18

For example, there have been a number of suits

19

where employers have sought injunctions against activity

20

that was clearly protected, such as picketing.

21

cases, it has been the Board's habit to evaluate the

22

motive for such suit, and if the Board determines that

23

the motive is one of good faith, the Board has typically

24

not restrained the state court suit.

25

QUESTIONS

In such

Well, Mr. Katz, in this instance,

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

unless I am mistaken, your client was founi by the Board

2

to have committed an unfair labor practice by

3

prosecuting the suit.

4

HR. KATZ;

Yes, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION*

And you are not challenging that?

6
7

That is not an issue you raised in your cert petition?
MR. KATZ*

Well, we are certainly challenging

8

that an unfair labor practice has occurred in the filing

9

of the suit, and more importantly, we are challenging

10

the process by which the Board reached its conclusion

11

that an unfair labor practice had existed.

12
13
14

QUESTION;

The Board --

But that issue really wasn't raised

in your petition, was it?
MR. KATZ;

The only issue that I think you may

15

be referring to that is missing from the petition is a

16

challenge to the specific findings that the leaflet was

17

truthful and did not constitute defamation.

18

challenge the —

19

QUESTION*

We did not

I read your petition as challenging

20

the power of the Board to order you to cease and desist

21

from the state court action.

22

MR. KATZ;

And the ability of the Board to

23

find that a suit filed in state court which has a lawful

24

puprose on its face and is subject to state court

25

jurisdiction is an unfair labor practice.

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

The Board now asserts the right, and it is a

2

very broad right, to conduct a threshold scrutiny of

3

litigation involving labor disputes in order to

4

determine whether the plaintiff’s motivation is to use

5

an apparently lawful suit in order to retaliate against

6

the defendant for conduct protected by the National

7

Labor Relations Act.

8
9

We believe the Board has no such power.

When

a civil suit has a lawful objective on its face, and is

10

subject to state court jurisdiction, the state court

11

interest is superior.

12

balancing of interests, when we are involved with a

13

labor dispute, when there are some federal rights at

14

issue, and when there are some state rights to be

15

protected, but when the suit has a lawful objective, it

16

is properly subject to state court jurisdiction, that

17

balancing test requires that the state court interest be

18

superior, and that the state court bears responsibility

19

for trial on the merits and for all appropriate relief.

20

We recognize that there is a

Concern that the litigation may be motivated

21

by improper considerations should not allow the Board to

22

subject the plaintiff in the suit to an administrative

23

trial of the civil complaint in order to assess his

24

motive by evaluating the factual and the legal support

25

for his civil claims.

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

If the Board does intend to determine that the

2

weakness in a plaintiff's suit justifies an inference

3

that the suit was brought for retaliatory purposes and

4

is therefore an unfair labor practice, then the Board

5

must await the decision of the state court, and to the

6

extent that the state court fails to provide sufficient

7

relief to accommodate the interests of the National

8

Labor Relations Act, the Board still has the ability to

9

step in and to award the proper relief.

All you would say is, the Board

MR. KATZ:

I think that the Board cannot

interfere with a pending state suit.

15

cannot go forward because there are procedures that the

16

employer will be required to go through in the Board

17

that will adversely impact on his ability to go forward

18

in the state case.

19

QUESTION:

I think the Board

Mr. Katz, what do you mean by the

20

Board going forward?

21

of the possible proceedings against the employer, or do

22

you mean just going forward in making a determination as

23

to the merits of the employer's state court suit?

24
25

MR. KATZ:

Do you mean going forward with any

I mean the latter.

If the employer

were alleged to have committed a series of unfair labor

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

practices, one of which was the filing of a civil suit

2

which is alleged to be retaliatory, I would certainly

3

concede that the Board can go forward to adjudicate the

4

other unfair labor practices, and perhaps to look at the

5

entire pattern and say, this employer is engaged in a

6

course of conduct which constitutes an unfair labor

7

practice and must be stopped, but even in such

8

circumstances, the Board could not restrain the pending

9

state court suit.

10

Once the state court suit had run its course,

11

and informed by the decision and the findings in the

12

state court, the Board might then decide to supplement

13

the relief it had provided by a further order enjoining

14

the commencement perhaps of subsequent state court

15

proceedings which might be a part of that same pattern

16

and practice of coercive conduct.

17

QUESTION;

What if the action of the Board was

18

initiated before the state court suit, on allegations of

19

unfair labor practice, and then it develops that the

20

suit is filed and they expand the case?

21

have to stop?

22

MR. KRTZs

No, Your Honor.

You say they

The Board's

23

authority to find an unfair labor practice based on a

24

threat to file a lawsuit is not challenged here, nor is

25

evidence to indicate that the employee is going to

engage in some conduct, including perhaps a suit which

would be a violation of the National Labor Relations

Our case is

Your position would be that if what

8

had happened here was that Bill Johnson's had threatened

9

a lawsuit, that the National Labor Relations Board could

10

go ahead and process a complaint.

11

HR. KATZ;

That is correct. Justice O'Connor.

12

QUESTION;

But if the suit is filed by Bill

13

Johnson's, then it must stop what it is doing.

14

MR. KATZ;

That is not only my contention,

15

Justice O'Connor.

It is what the Board has held for

16

many, many years.

One year before our civil suit was

17

filed, the Board decided the case of Essie Nichols

18

Marcey, in 1977, cited in our papers.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

first case decided by the Board was in which the

2

conducting of a state lawsuit was found to be an unfair

3

labor practice?

4

MR. KATZ:

The first case that comes to mind.

5

Your Honor, is the 1960 case, I believe it is, of Clyde

6

Taylor, although I remember the Clyde Taylor overruled a

7

case called W.T. Carter, which may have been on the same

8

issue.

9

are, of course, opposites.

The W.T. Carter case and the Clyde Taylor case
In Clyde Taylor there was a

10

finding that the employer had as part of a bad faith

11

effort to stop a union campaign filed a civil suit.

12

Nevertheless, the Board in that 1960 case, adopting the

13

dissent in W.T. Carter, decided many years before, held

14

that even -- without specifically saying so, the Court

15

held that even the bad faith motive which it had found

16

would not deprive the employer of the right to file a

17

civil action in court, because the right of an

18

individual to go to court, to seek judicial protection

19

of his claims, was too important to be declared an

20

unfair labor practice.

What the Board has done in the 23 years since

MR. KATZs

In order for the suit to be

18

coercive in such a manner that the National Labor

19

Relations Board can intervene, the suit has to ask for

20

relief which is a violation of the National Labor

21

procedure, for example, a specific abuse of process

Ms. Corwin, I am sure you will make

whether or not as a matter of labor law, national labor

law, the Board must find not only that the suit is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAROLYN F. CORWIN, ESQ.,

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

13

MS. CORWIN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

14

please the Court, Justice White, the response to that is

15

that the issue before the Board in an unfair labor

16

practice proceeding is whether there has been a

17

violation of the National Labor Relations Act, whether

18

there has, for example, been a coercive interference

19

with protection of rights, employee rights under Section

20

7.

21

QUESTION;

22

MS. CORWIN;

Yes.
The issue that the Board

23

considers in a situation like this one, in which the

prosecution of the civil suit itself is coercive

of different sorts of evidence that can be used.
QUESTION:

So that if ha wouldn't have — so

7

that if he has the unlawful motivation, that’s — the

8

unfair labor practice is complete at that point.

9

MS. CORWIN;

The unlawful motivation is the

10

central focus of the inquiry.

11

that the filing of a civil suit for the purpose of

12

retaliation has an inherently coercive effect, and to

13

that extent effect is part of the calculus, but the

14

Board’s essential inquiry in a charge like this is, what

15

is the employer's motivation.

16

QUESTION;

The Board has recognized

Right, and if they find that his

17

motivation is anti-union or whatever it takes to make an

18

unfair labor practice, it could be that the unfair labor

19

practice would be found even if, even if on any

20

objective basis the lawsuit had — wasn’t frivolous, or

21

that it had a foundation in fact.

would in all probability succeed, and that goes to the

Would they say that is an unfair labor practice?

It seems to me that what the

— to the extent he made that sort of a finding, would

have to know something about the law of the state.

I think that the judge may need

to know something about whether a particular statement

is true or false.

I think perhaps the broad outlines

MS. CORWIN;

Of the state — of the components

of libel law, for example, the truth or falsity of a

statement.

QUESTION;

Are you suggesting that libel law

is uniform throughout the 50 states?
MS. CORWIN;

I'm not suggesting that, but I'm

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

suggesting that the inquiry of the Administrative Law

2

Judge is very limited, and to the extent there is an

3

examination of this reasonable basis concept, it is

4

confined to the sorts of questions like, is the

5

statement true or false, is there any indication that

6

there was malice.

7

8

It is really a very —

QUESTION;

Well, how do you know when malice

is necessary, without turning to the state law?

9

MS. CORWIN;

Well, I think that if one gets

10

into the sort of questions that require further legal

11

analysis or further inquiry into state law, I simply

12

don't think that's the sort of thing the Administrative

13

Law Judge is going to do.
QUESTION;

14

It is a very basic inquiry.

But, Ms. Corwin, in his own

15

findings he did conclude that the respondent did not

16

have a reasonable basis for filing his lawsuit.

17

or three places, he says something similar to that.

18

he had to make that inquiry before he made that

19

finding.

20

MS. CORWIN;

In two
So

Well, I think the inquiry of

21

whether there is a reasonable basis for the lawsuit is

22

not the same inquiry as who is going to prevail under

the particular state law, and how the merits —

2

MS. CORWIN:

Well, I think in this case, for

3

example, you had the employer state that it had a

4

reasonable basis for the lawsuit because on the face of

5

it it simply — it simply stated state law claims, and

6

that was the end of that, and you had the employer

7

saying, I filed the lawsuit because I felt that I was

8

personally attacked for filthy restrooms and unwarranted

9

sexual advances.

10
11

QUESTION:

looked at the facts and said those attacks were true.

12

MS. CORWIN:

14

That's correct.
I mean, you can't say he didn't

look at the merits of the case, then.

And the Administrative Law Judge

Well, he looked at some very

basic facts of the case.

But I don't know how you can argue that he

MS. CORWIN:

No, I don't argue that he didn't

22

look at the merits.

I suggest he did not have the task

23

of deciding the merits, and in fact what he did in this

24

case was to see whether the employer had presented any

25

evidence that might support some sort of a reasonable

440 FIRST ST, N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

basis for bringing the suit.

2

QUESTION;

Well, is it your position that what

3

the Board has to do is to simply find whether the

4

employer had reasonable grounds for believing that the

5

alleged facts he is relying on occurred?

6

MS. CORWIN;

Or what?

Meli, I think that is one

7

possibility. I think it depends on what the employer

8

suggests.

9

thought such and such was true because people informed

10

The employer could come forward and say,

I

QUESTION;

Well, but what’s the Board's

12

standard in these cases?

14

MS. CORWIN:

That is what I think we are

Well, again, I would have to

15

reiterate that the Board is concerned with what the

16

employer's motive is.

17

labor practice proceeding is what sort of intent did an

18

employer have, what sort of effect does the conduct

19

have.

20

The Board inquiry in an unfair

Is this —
QUESTION;

Well, is the determination of

21

whether the lawsuit has a reasonable basis in fact just

22

a means of assessing whether it was filed for a

23

retaliatory purpose?

24

MS. CORWIN:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

It is an indicator.

And that is all?

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

MS. CORWIN;

It is an indication among many of

2

what the employer’s motive was, whether it was for the

3

purpose of coercing employees in the exercise of their

4

protected activity.

5

QUESTION;

Well, it now sounds like you have

6

answered the question you were very reluctant to answer

7

a while ago, if you answered yes to Justice O’Connor’s

8

question, that it is only relevant to determination of

9

motive, and it is not an independent factor required to

If the basic inquiry is motive,

Yes, that’s correct.
Then a conclusion of bad motive is

Do you agree that the complaint in the state

MS. CORWIN*

We have not questioned that.

I

think I can say that we would accept that.

5

QUESTION*

And the end result of the Board's

6

decision that was enforced by the Court of Appeals for

7

the Ninth Circuit is to enjoin the prosecution of that

8

suit, is it not?

9

MS. CORWIN*

That is correct.

At least to

10

enforce the Court's cease and desist order requiring

11

dismissal of that suit.

12

QUESTION*

Yes.

So the effect of all of it is

13

that the libel suit cannot go forward in the state

14

court, so that the Labor Board where a federal court

15

enforces its order may enjoin a libel suit bona fide on

16

its face?

17

MS. CORWIN*

That is the result only after the

18

Board has found that the filing and prosecution of the

suit is an unfair labor practice because it was for the

20

purpose of harassing the employees for the exercise of

21

their protected rights.

QUESTION;

There were

Suppose it had gone to trial and a

verdict and judgment entered on it for the plaintiff

11

obligated to respect that, or what would have happened

12

then?
MS. CORWIN;

13

Would it have been

Well, I think the Board's

14

reaction to that development, had it occurred, which it

15

did not in this case, but had it occurred, I think would

16

depend on the circumstances in which that judgment were

17

entered.

18

because the waitresses here couldn't afford to hire a

19

lawyer and to pursue the suit to that extent, I don't

20

think the Board would feel constrained by any default

21

judgment, for example.

If it were, for example, a default judgment

22

If it were a judgment on the merits, I think

23

again it would depend on what the Board could identify

24

in the decision as relevant to its inquiry into motive.

25

I think obviously the Board would think twice about what

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

a state court had found on the merits, but again, it's

2

conceivable that a trial court would err in the state

3

and that the employee wouldn't have the money to pursue

4

an appeal. The waitresses in this case may not be able

5

to pursue this sort of litigation through to the state

situation like that.

QUESTION:

Ms. Corwin, would you agree that

2

your theory as you have given it to us in response to

Justice White's questions is quite different from the

4

theory of the Court of Appeals, which did rely squarely

5

on the absence of any reasonable basis in fact, and on

6

that finding?

7

MS. CORWIN*

Well, I think the Court of

8

Appeals relied not only on the lack of reasonable basis

9

in fact, but I think it recognized that there were other

10

indications, other significant indications, such as the

11

statement about getting even, the statement by a —

12

QUESTION:

There is additional evidence of

13

improper motive, but I think it was critical to their

14

holding that there was a finding that has not been

15

challenged, as I understand it, in the cert petition,

16

that there was no reasonable basis in fact, which is

17

quite different from your theory.

18

understand it, is that if there is improper motive, no

19

matter how good the lawsuit is, there is still an unfair

20

labor practice.

21

MS. CORWIN:

Your theory, as I

I have tried to suggest that the

conclusion as to whether the —

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

that’s a very different theory than the Court of Appeals

2

theory.

3

MS. CORWIN:

Well, I think the Court of

4

Appeals spent considerable time on the reasonable basis

point, but I think it, too, recognized that it goes to

whether the motive of the employer is one that violates

7

the federal labor laws.

QUESTION:

Well, if we agree with you on that,

that that is what the — it seems to me we really ought

10

to remand to the Court of Appeals, because I thought

11

they had relied on — I agree with Justice Stevens, they

12

had relied on the lack of reasonable basis as an

13

independent required element in the proof of the unfair

labor practice.

MS. CORWIN:

In a case like that,

I think the

evidence was close, and that the motivation was not as

16

clear as it was in a case such as this one.

conclusion that a particular sort of coercive conduct

that may be analogous to other sorts of coercive conduct

that employers use,

conduct that this employer chose somehow ought to be

immunized from the coverage of the federal labor laws.

In this

that that — the particular form of

suspect that there were not, but I really don't know.

14

The rule that the Board follows and has followed since

15

1960 is the one referred to as the Clyde Taylor rule,

16

and that is that the general practice of the Board is to

17

not find an unfair labor practice in the case of good

18

faith litigation. That is the general rule, and that

19

continues to be applied today.

20

However, the Board has recognized that in a

21

case like this, when you have employees who are just

22

faced with the devastating effect of a retaliatory suit,

23

a suit for half a million dollars in punitive damages,

24

that that can provide such a coerceve effect that at

25

least in the case where you have clear proof of

1

retaliation, that the suit was brought for the purpose

2

of harassment, that here you have an unfair labor

3

practice, here you have to step apart from the general

4

rule of Clyde Taylor and conclude that this sort of

5

retaliatory suit is an unfair labor practice.

QUESTION*

I think —

Is there any way to accommodate the

7

parallel interests here short of ordering a cease and

8

desist of the state suit?

9

12

MS. CORWIN;

Well —

QUESTION;

Is there any middle ground or other

means of accommodating these interests?
MS. CORWIN;

Well, to some extent, they have

13

been accommodated already in the general rule that good

14

faith litigation will not be the basis for an unfair

15

labor practice.

16

In the narrow class of cases we are talking

17

about here, where the Board has found that the suit is

18

brought for the purpose of harassment, it doesn’t seem

19

to me that you can vindicate the federal right, that you

20

can protect the employee rights that the Act guarantees

21

and that you can deter the sort of coercive employer

22

conduct you have here without issuing a cease and desist

23

order as you would against any unfair labor practice,

24

telling the employer to stop.

25

And I think that there simply isn’t another

remedy that is going to be very effective.
QUESTIOHi

You don't think payment of fees and

3

expenses and letting the state court determine the

4

merits of the action would be an accommodation?

5

US. CORWINs

Well, I think reimbursement of

6

legal expenses may get you part of the way there, but it

7

doesn't do anything to solve the question of the

8

employees, these waitresses, who are forced to engage

9

legal counsel, to pay out a lot of expenses on things

10

like depositions and trials and so on.

11

of coercive conduct the Act was designed to deter and to

12

prevent, and to provide a remedy for.

13

That is the sort

It doesn't seem to me that one can provide

14

that sort of remedy by simply saying, all right, we will

15

let this unfair labor practice proceed.

16

not the sort of remedy that Congress intended in the

17

case of coercive conduct of a particularly devastating

18

type like the suit you have here.

19

QUESTIONS

That is simply

Of course, I wonder if the suit can

20

really be characterized as that devastating if it is

21

frivolous on its face.

22

MS. CORWINi

Well, I think that the -- what

23

occurred in this case is an example of what can happen.

24

Even with a suit like that, the employees were notified

25

on Monday morning that a temporary restraining order
