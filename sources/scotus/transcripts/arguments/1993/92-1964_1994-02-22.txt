ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case involves the rule adopted by the
National Labor Relations Board for determining when nurses

3

are supervisors within the meaning of the National Labor

4

Relations Act.

5

direction of less-skilled employees, as a matter of

6

professional judgment incidental to the treatment of

7

patients, does not make the nurse into a statutory

8

supervisor.

9

Now, the Board's rule is that a nurse's

In this case, the Board applied that rule to the

20

nurses employed in respondent's nursing home.

The Board

21

found that the nurses employed by respondent in that

22

facility engaged in direct patient care, making rounds,

23

administering medicines, talking to physicians, and

24

maintaining records.

25

care of patients, the nurses give some direction to the

As an incidental function of taking

1

nurse's aides who work with the nurses to bathe, dress,

2

and feed the residents in the home.

3

that the nurses' use of the aides in that fashion to carryÂ­

4

out their nursing responsibilities did not make the nurses

5

statutory supervisors.

6

QUESTION:

The Board concluded

Mr. Dreeben, does the Board's rule or

7

decisions in this area of nurses and who is a supervisor

8

and who isn't,

9

other areas of employment?

10

are there analogous rules or principles in

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

The

11

Board's rule in this case is really a particularized

12

application of a general principle that has found

13

expression in two different areas under the statute.

14

first is that the Board has crafted a rule to deal with

15

the problem of minor supervisory personnel; those persons

16

who are characterized by Congress as being below the level

17

of foreman and not exercising the kind of supervision that

18

aligns them with management.

19

And in cases of that character,

The

the Board has

20

found that when direction is given by leaders of groups

21

that work together or by journeymen to apprentice,

22

when that direction is a function of superior skill or

23

greater experience and not the sort of supervision that

24

aligns the employee with management,

25

is not treated as a supervisor.

that

that kind of employee

QUESTION:

1

Well, in looking at the language of

2

the statute, it appears that the Board relies, primarily

3

at least in this context, on the language that it is --

4

that the nurses are not acting in the interests of the

5

employer, but rather in the interests of the patient.
MR. DREEBEN:

6

That is one of the three means by

7

which the Board reaches the route that it does under the

8

statute.

9
10

QUESTION:
reliance.

MR. DREEBEN:

11
12

But that seems to be the primary

I think, Justice O'Connor, it's --

it is equally important with two other provisions of the

3

statute.

4

requirement that a supervisor exercise one of the

5

functions listed in the statute, and the relevant one

6

here, the most important one here, is -- are the words

7

"responsibly to direct."
QUESTION:

8
9

The one that is most relevant here is the

I read the opinions below the same

way Justice O'Connor did, that the Board seemed to be

20

principally relying on the idea that the claimed

21

supervisors acted in the patient's interest and not in

22

management's interest, which I frankly find quite a weak

23

read.

24
25

MR. DREEBEN:

Chief Justice Rehnquist, that is

one of the ways that the Board has used to articulate the

1

point that it's trying to get across.

The point that it's

2

trying to accomplish here is to distinguish and draw lines

3

between the kind of supervision that Congress intended

4

would disqualify a person from the protection of the Act

5

from the sort of direction that goes on a day-to-day basis

6

in a variety of workplace settings when minor supervisors,

7

who have greater skill or familiarity with the working

8

situation, are -- give some direction to people who work

9

on a team with them.

10

QUESTION:

But, yes --

11

QUESTION:

How does that, in any way, relate to

12

the distinction between acting in the client's interest or

13

the patient's interest and acting in the employer's

14

interest?

15

MR. DREEBEN:

The Board is not taking the

16

position that the nurses are working contrary to the

17

employer's interest, but the words "in the interest of the

18

employer" have to have some meaning, because all

19

employees, as the Board has recognized, from the board of

20

directors right down to the maintenance staff, the lowest

21

levels, all work to further the employer's business

22

interests.

23

Those words were not put into the statute to be

24

a superfluous reiteration of that principle.

25

put in, as the original draftsman of the language

They were

explained, to express the view that these are the type of

2

employees who are really expressing managerial authority

3

in their work.

4

attempting to say that these nurses are somehow working

5

contrary to the employer's interest.

6

defining and interpreting the language "in the interest of

7

the employer" to give it the kind of meaning that Congress

8

had originally intended.

9

And the Board is not, in this case,

QUESTION:

It is simply

Are you saying that the nurses fall

10

into the same category as what your adversary calls the

11

straw boss?

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, the Board has said that.

13

And, in fact, in this very case at page 40a of the

14

petition appendix, the ALJ explicitly drew the analogy

15

between the kind of work direction that these nurses do

16

and the kind that is done in this minor supervisor line of

17

case that the Board has had under the statute for many,

18

many years.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, I always envisioned the

20

so-called lead man or straw boss as someone who supervises

21

a single team.

But these nurses are doing much more.

I'll

And if

1

nothing more were at issue here than a nurse directing the

2

nurse's aide with respect to the particular patient that

3

that nurse is working with at that moment, I would say

4

yes, the nurse -- you know, when she tells the nurse's

5

aide, you know, bring this, bring that, bring the other,

6

that's acting as a straw boss, that's acting as a lead

7

man.

8

aides from one patient to another, from perhaps one wing

9

of the hospital to another; when she authorizes overtime;

But not when she shifts, it seems to me, nurse's

10

when she does all sorts of things that relate not to the

11

particular team that is working on a particular patient,

isn't -- I don't know any other way to distinguish the

cases do involve kinds -- the kinds of cases that you've
described, Justice Scalia, but they also involve cases

7

where you have the most skilled person, say, at a print

8

shop supervising a variety of lesser-skilled employees and

9

telling them what to do, telling them where to go, what --

20

when to do their various assignments in order to make sure

21

that the whole puzzle fits together.

22

But I think it's very important to focus on what

23

these nurses did at the nursing home in question, because

24

the ALJ made fact findings on it and the record supports

25

those fact findings.

I don't think there's any question

here of substantial evidence.
The ALJ found that to the extent that the nurses

2

3

had any function at all to assign the aides, that was

4

purely a matter of routine that involved no independent

judgment.

nursing described it as being "pretty well cut and dried";

And as she put it, it was just a sort

of formula to be followed.
And the ALJ found, again at page 40a of the

12

appendix, that the assignment that these nurses did during

13

the relevant period in time was purely --

QUESTION:

Whereabouts on -- whereabouts on page

40a are you referring to, Mr. Dreeben?
MR. DREEBEN:

On page 40a of the petition

17

appendix, Chief Justice, that's at the top of the page.

18

It's a carry-over from the prior paragraph.

19

QUESTION:

Thank you.

20

MR. DREEBEN:

The ALJ says:

"The eight

21

assignment duties of the nurses seem to me to fall well

22

short of requiring the use of independent judgment."

23

that is an independent requirement for being a supervisor

24

under Section 2(11) of the Act.

25

independent judgment in the tasks that are described,

Without a showing of

And

1

there is no supervisory status.
QUESTION:

2

3

Is that a factual determination or a

legal determination?
MR. DREEBEN:

4

I think it's a factual

5

determination which is subject to review under the

6

substantial evidence standard.

8

QUESTION:

He surely doesn't put it that way,

does he?
MR. DREEBEN:

Board cases and to a court of appeals case that make that

clear.

13

within the context of reviewing the application of the act

14

to specific circumstances.

15

The Board certainly has latitude under Chevron to

And in this case that's what these nurses did.

16

They did it as a matter of routine.

17

functions were not nearly as sophisticated as Your Honor

18

has implied.

19

in the record where the director of nursing decided I want

20

things done in a different way, I want them -- I want you

21

to use much more judgment in the way you do it.

22

nurses who do those sorts of things might be exercising

23

independent judgment, but these nurses with respect to

24

assignment were not doing that.

25

The assignment

MR. DREEBEN:

They did not authorize overtime.

3

The ALJ again explicitly found that they did not have

4

authority to authorize overtime.

5

QUESTION:

Where is that, Mr. Dreeben?

6

MR. DREEBEN:

That's in the petition appendix.

7

I do not have the exact page at this moment.

8

again, specifically found they do not have the authority

9

to authorize overtime.

10

QUESTION:

But the ALJ,

They initialed time cards.

Look at page 41a of the petitioner's

11

appendix where the opinion says:

"The second way the duty

12

nurse may attempt to deal with an aide's failure to show

13

up for work is to ask the aides who are scheduled to go

14

off duty if one of them is willing to remain at the

15

facility on overtime."

16

MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct.

But the nurse

17

herself did not make any decision about whether the aide

18

would be authorized to obtain overtime.

19

decision that was reserved by the director of nursing.

20

QUESTION:

Oh, really?

That was a

She -- you mean she can

21

ask the nurse's aide if she's willing to serve on

22

overtime -- and I assume this means at a time when there's

23

no one else around.

25

nurses were not supervisors, there was no supervisor --

9

QUESTION:

10

-- There was nobody at the nursing

11

home who was a supervisor during 75 percent of the working

12

day.

13

That's the position that the Board is taking, right?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, yes, that is the position

14

that we're taking, and a large component of that time

15

consists of the night shift at which there is very little

16

staff at the hospital other than what is necessary and

17

nurses on duty at each --

Where was this, in Alaska, you have a

MR. DREEBEN:

20

No, I said a large component of

21

that.

Obviously, Justice Scalia, there were times when

22

the director of nursing or the administrator were not

there.

again found that the director of nursing is available on

appendix.

Since the administrator and the DON are always

2

on call and since the nurses do, in fact, call the

3

administrator and the DON at their homes when nonroutine

4

matters arise, that was an indication that, indeed, this

5

nursing home had a mechanism of supervising its aides.
QUESTION:

6

Well, Mr. Dreeben, looking at the

7

language of this statute today, and in an attempt to

justify the Board's rule, what do you think the strongest

There's another very important consideration in

QUESTION:

Uh-hum.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Another major category of

17

employees treated analogously are professional employees.

18

Now, the Act in Section 2(11) excludes supervisors from

19

coverage.

20

QUESTION:

Well, do you --do you take the

21

position that these nurses are professional employees

22

within the definition of the statute?

23

MR. DREEBEN:

No, in this case they are not.

skill and knowledge to be covered by the Act, and that

creates some tension between Sections 2 (11), which exclude

QUESTION:

So a registered nurse would be

MR. DREEBEN:

No question,

a registered nurse

15

would be considered a professional.

16

significance of that distinction I think would simply be

17

that the nurses who are registered nurses would have the

18

right to a unit that did not include nonprofessionals.

19

But for purpose of interpreting the Act and looking at the

20

interplay between the professional exemption and the

21

exclusion for supervisors,

22

Board has to make an accommodation.

2

the fact that architects have draftsmen, engineers have

machine operators, and the like.

5

Lawyers have paralegals

And if Congress had not intended to accord

protection to the Act to these people because they engage

in such minor supervisory activities, the entire coverage

of professionals would have made very little sense.

should be deemed to fall on the supervisor side of the

line.

QUESTION:

Can you tell us an opinion in which

14

the Board has done just that, has shown that it is playing

15

off the tension between these two sections?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, first of all, the Board

17

issued a decision in Northcrest Nursing Home which we cite

18

in our reply brief, which occurred after we filed our

19

opening brief in this case, that represents a

20

comprehensive review of the legal principles in this area

21

and explicitly draws the connections both to the straw

boss/lead man line of cases that I referred to earlier, as

well as the tension to the professional line of work.

Correct.

the nurse could say that and authorize that overtime,

with -- any way with the Board's ultimate conclusion that

Now, again, we think that the Court's opinion in

approach in this case, its general legal approach,

12

regardless of how any particular fact situation may be

approach.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, I don't read that

18

to say is that hospital policy is if somebody doesn't show

19

up for work and if you have to divide it up, the other --

20

the aides can decide among themselves which one shall work

21

overtime, and the nurse can let them do that.

22

MR. DREEBEN:

23

QUESTION:

But what I understand it

Well --

It's this hospital policy that says

MR. DREEBEN:

Certainly all of this flows from

the hospital policies.

3

really, one way or the other, this point is dispositive of

4

the validity of the Board's legal role, which is the issue

5

that we're presenting for decision to this Court.

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12

13
14

MS. MAHONEY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to start out by saying that I really

15

did think that the issue in this case was not whether the

16

court of appeals had erred in its application of the

17

substantial evidence test under the traditional statutory

18

criteria for finding supervisory status, but rather that

19

the question that was presented in the petition was

20

whether the court of appeals had erred by rejecting the

21

Board's interpretation of the statute, not the application

22

of the evidence.

23

And, in fact, there is -- under Universal Camera

24

this Court has said, and repeatedly held, that the

25

application of substantial evidence to a settled statutory
26

1

meaning is something that's placed in the charge of the

2

court of appeals and it would rarely be disturbed by this

3

Court absent some indication that it was grossly

4

misapplied or misapprehended.

5

now come in today and suddenly start citing all these

6

transcript cites about how these people really didn't --

7

these nurses really didn't have any independent judgment

8

or meet the traditional statutory criteria seems not to

9

be, to me, the issue in this case.

So for the Government to

10

And in fact, as the court of appeals found, if

11

you evaluate the activity that these nurses performed on

12

behalf of the nursing home under the traditional criteria,

13

look at the structure of the operations, look at what the

14

higher levels of management were expecting them to do, you

15

would find that they were, in fact, charged with the

16

overall direction, assignment, with the use of independent

17

judgment for the operation of the facility.

18

In fact, the findings of the ALJ specifically

19

say that these nurses were in charge of a wing of the

20

nursing home for much of the time.

21

to emphasize here that there's only one floor nurse on the

22

floor on the wing of a hospital overseeing the care that's

23

being given to 50 residents at any time, and that the

24

director of nursing and the assistant director of nursing

25

are absent from the facility 75 percent of the time.

I think it's important

Similarly, to say that the ALJ found that they

1

2

didn't exercise independent judgment in connection with

3

the exercise of their responsibilities is not supported by

4

the -- either the findings of the judge or what he said at

5

page 40a.

6

exercise independent judgment in connection with the

7

direction of the work of the aides.

8

what they do doesn't equate to responsibly directing the

9

aides in the interests of the employer.

10

He finds --he does not say they do not

He says he finds that

He never goes on to make some separate finding

11

that they didn't use independent judgment, and the

12

question, the way it's posed, seems to presume that they

13

did, by saying whether the Board reasonably determined

14

that employees, in the exercise of professional judgment,

15

were properly denied supervisory status.

16

QUESTION:

So --

Ms. Mahoney, may I just ask you a

17

question about the assumption you're making about the

18

statute, and I think I'll understand your argument better.

19

Do you agree that in each of the three categories covered

20

by the statute, the sort of assignment responsibility, the

21

direction responsibility when they're working, and the

22

grievance responsibility, that the statute seems to make a

23

distinction between levels of responsibility?

24
25

It seems to assume that a given professional,
for example, could do any of these three things

conceivably, but there are different levels of

speaks of responsibly directing them.

sort of opaque adjectives, but they seem to be -- at least

6

to be getting to the -- to make the point that there are

two different levels, and only if you meet the sort of

whatever the standards are for the highest level do you

9

fall into the supervisory category.

For example -- and just as an example, it

Now, those may be

Do you accept that basic view of the statute?

That there is a?

That there's kind of a two -- there's

14

of these three categories?

MS. MAHONEY:

I think so.

Let me see if I

and agree that in order to be found to have engaged in

activity that could be called responsibly to direct the

3

MS. MAHONEY:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

In fact,

4

what the courts and the Board has traditionally done

5

outside of the health care area and some other

6

professional contexts, is they have looked at the

7

structure of the employer's operation and tried to locate

8

where that -- the person who's alleged to be a supervisor

9

falls on the hierarchy, and whether that person has

10

overall day-to-day responsibility for overseeing the

activities of other subordinate employees.

could not have -- suppose we had a legal aid unit that was

operating that way,- the lawyers would not be protected

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, Your Honor, if the lawyer in

13

that assignment process also had the authority to

14

effectively recommend, for instance, whether that

MS. MAHONEY:

I think that -- you mean have they

In the -- since 1974 -- you pointed

out, quite correctly, that the Board seemed to be shifting

haven't noticed that they have, and correct me if I'm

wrong.

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, the shift, Your Honor,

that's occurred is they've been finding more and more and

more nurses to be supervise -- not to be supervisors even

if they disciplined -- for instance, in the Riverchase

connection with patient care.

Because the Board took its

2

rationale to sort of its logical conclusion, which is that

3

anything done incidental to patient care is going to

4

disqualify them from supervisory status.

5

And, again, if we just look at the structure of

6

this nursing home and compare it to the structure of many

7

of the industries and facilities that the Board has

8

traditionally looked at, the Dale Operating case; Ohio

9

Power; Maine, Vermont and Yankee; what they do is they say

10

if the person who's in charge of the floor or the

11

facility -- even if they don't have the power to decide

12

whether to give someone a raise or whether to fire them or

13

hire them, if they really are responsible for the safety

14

of the operations and for ensuring that those people do

15

their work and keep to it and do it in a safe manner, that

16

an employer has got to be able to demand the undivided

17

loyalty of its representative on the floor of the plant or

18

on -- in this case, on the floor of the nursing home.

19

That's really what these cases are designed to

20

find, is whether the employer has a legitimate need in

21

order to rely upon the undivided loyalty.

22

back up and look at what Taft-Hartley was all about to

begin with, it was a reaction to the fact that the Board

has interpreted its authority to permit foreman to

unionize.

But, Your Honor, it doesn't.

That's not the way that this particular statutory

10

provision is written.

And if I could just turn to the

11

language, the reason I think it's necessary is because it

12

doesn't define supervisor in terms of any employee that

3

works for a particular employer.

4

there -- they might have an argument that the additional

5

phrase "in the interest of the employer" was superfluous.

Instead it says the term "supervisor" means, "any

individual having authority."

QUESTION:

6

So you're saying that "interest of

the employer" is inserted to make sure that we're covering

8

employees?
MS. MAHONEY:

9

QUESTION:

10

Excuse me?

I'm sorry.

You're saying that the function of

11

including the phrase "interest of the employer" in the

12

statute is to ensure that what we are dealing with are

3

employees, as opposed to independent contractors?

4

MS. MAHONEY:

No.

I'm saying that it draws a

5

number of lines.

6

activities are being performed on behalf of the employer,

7

as opposed to on behalf of the employee in his personal

interests or in the collective interests of the union.

Second, it also makes sure that, for instance, with

respect to third parties who may be supervising the

21

employees of the employer, that they -- because it says

contradict the rather common sense observation that all

employees to some extent are working for the interest of

the employer.

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, Your Honor, in the -- if I

could just mention also the third place where it's

significant, is that if an employer -- I mean if an

employee works for two different employers and is a

supervisor for one and not a supervisor for the other, if

you don't have that phrase in there they actually would be

11

deemed a supervisor for all employers.

employer who is alleged to have engaged in the wrongful

activity or denying the Section 7 right.

Because this is

So, are you saying that the phrase,

then, has rather little to do with this case, or that it

has everything to do with this case?

18

MS. MAHONEY:

It has all -- it has little to do

19

with this case in that it is -- it's -- in the situation

20

where you're dealing with employees, this phrase, prior to

21

the 1970's in the health care context, was never a

dispositive factor in the cases.

is really trying to do here is to regain, reclaim

in 1947 Congress adopted the position of the dissenting

And

MS. MAHONEY:

No, Your Honor, I don't think so.

8

First of all, as this Court recently said in Betts, that

9

unless Congress -- when this Court has interpreted a

phrase in a statute and said that it's unambiguous, the

11

fact that Congress changes the result in the case doesn't

mean that it disavowed the interpretation of the plain

And, in fact, if you go through the Board's

cases from 1947 forward outside the health care area, on

analogous facts there are many cases without any reference

to "the interest of the employer," of course, where they

have found that precisely this kind of activity is

20

supervisory in character and that an employer is entitled

21

to demand the undivided loyalty of those people.

And one of the things, too, that the Board

And there the Board's decision -- the Board's

here is that the Board stopped applying that test after

What do you make of footnote 30 in

Yeshiva which seems to say that nurses fall in this group

responsibility and authority to direct and evaluate

others?

16

MS. MAHONEY:

I think what Yeshiva is talking

17

about is they were asking the question that the court --

18

is consistent with the court of appeals, and that is to

19

say do these -- do the university professors only do those

20

things that all university professors do, or do they do

21

something beyond that.

22

And I think that what the Court was really

saying is that when they exercise decisionmaking authority

In other words, you said --

MS. MAHONEY:

You'd have to take away the

responsibility to be the senior personnel who's got the

oversight of all of the performance of their functions.

If you've got another hierarchical structure, I think that

that's the main distinction among the cases.

to more than one interpretation.

This is a Chevron case.

The terms that

The Board has examined

5

the facts of various industries in light of its power to

6

apply the Act to particular situations, and it has arrived

7

at an interpretation designed to draw the very distinction

8

that Congress intended between those with supervisory

9

authority that aligns them with management and those with

10
11

minor supervisory duties.
QUESTION:

Has the Board found that any other

12

character of individual, in attending to the needs of the

13

customer of the employer, is not acting in the interest of

14

the employer but rather in the interest of the customer?

15

It is uniquely nurses that when they take care of

16

nursing-home customers, are not acting in the interest of

17

the employer?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

No, it is not uniquely nurses.

What other fields has the Board

applied that theory to?
MR. DREEBEN:

The Board has not applied a theory

22

that's phrased in the same terms to other categories of

professionals, but --
