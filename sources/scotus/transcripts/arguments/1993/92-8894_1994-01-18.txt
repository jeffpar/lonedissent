ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. WEBER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER CLARENCE VICTOR
MR. WEBER:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The issue presented in this case is whether the

12

13

Nebraska supreme court failed to properly apply the

14

constitutional principles set forth in Cage v. Louisiana

15

to a jury instruction in Nebraska containing virtually

16

identical language.

17

The facts of this case specific to the issue of

18

the reasonable doubt instruction are whether or not the

19

defendant, Clarence Victor, the petitioner, was properly

20

convicted of first degree murder, and whether or not it

21

was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Victor

22

killed purposely and with deliberate and premeditated

23

malice.

24

this case is not at issue.

25

The responsibility for the death of the victim in

With respect to the specific instruction, I feel

it is most simple to break it down into two basic parts.

2

The instruction given in Mr. Victor's trial, NJI 14.08, is

3

found at the Joint Appendix at page 11.

4

QUESTION:

As I see it --

Mr. -- why -- ordinarily we say

5

instructions should be considered as a whole.

6

feel you should break this down into two parts?

7
8

MR. WEBER:

Why do you

Well, I do believe the prior

decisions of this Court do warrant looking at the
instruction as a whole, but I think the plain meaning of

10

the instruction, also consistent with the prior decisions

11

of this Court, would be to see two basic parts, one being

12

the burden for conviction, the other being the burden for

13

acquittal, and in this particular instruction I see those

14

two parts coming out in the plain meaning given to it.

15

With respect to that instruction, I would draw a

16

line after the sentence,

17

upon the strong probabilities of the case provided such

18

probabilities are strong enough to exclude any doubt of

1

his guilt that is reasonable," and I believe the following

20

sentence to the end of that instruction is the burden in

21

order to acquit, and as I've said, I believe the burden to

22

convict in this case similar to in Cage is too low, and

23

the burden to acquit too high.

24
25

"You may find the accused guilty

In this particular instance, with this
instruction, a conviction is allowed on the strong

1

probabilities of the case and to a moral certainty, as

2

determined by prior decisions of this Court, of strong

3

probabilities, and I believe the plain meaning of the

4

instruction, that initial part with respect to conviction,

5

the strong probability as read with the other portions of

6

the conviction-related portion of the instruction, allow

7

conviction on something that is tantamount to a civil

8

preponderance of the evidence standard.
QUESTION:

9
10

You say you do agree that this

instruction should be read as a whole.

11

MR. WEBER:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, I do.
And do you think that our decision in

13

Holland v. United States lays down the same standard as

14

was laid down in Cage?
MR. WEBER:

15

Well, as recognized, the standard

16

has changed somewhat, and specifically with respect to

17

Boyde --

18

QUESTION:

Well, but I mean the standard as to

19

the context of the instruction.

20

them, but Boyde dealt with reasonable understandings.

21

MR. WEBER:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Maybe you can't separate

Yes.
And other than that, do you think

that Holland and Cage lay down the same test?
MR. WEBER:

I believe so, in the sense that as

recognized I believe in Estelle, if not also in -6

recognized previously in Franklin, there might be a new
test when it comes to interpretation of jury instructions
and particularly in this case with respect to reasonable
doubt.
QUESTION:

Why would there be a new test in

interpreting an instruction on reasonable doubt?
MR. WEBER:

Well, as you found in -- taking

Winship in conjunction with Sullivan, just decided by the
Court last year,the concept of reasonable doubt and the
burden of the Government to prove reasonable doubt, to
prove conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, is so
fundamental that I believe it would be a recognized
exception to basic rules of interpretation.
QUESTION:

What authority do you have for that

proposition?
MR. WEBER:

Well, again I refer only to Sullivan

in the sense that it's such a fundamental guarantee with
respect to due process, the fundamental right of trial by
jury, and relieving the State of its burden.

I believe

you recognized in Sandstrom and in Franklin that relief of
the State's burden is a fundamental violation of due
process.
QUESTION:

Yes, but why does it follow from that

that a different standard should be applied to judging a
jury instruction on that subject than a jury instruction

on some other subject.

MR. WEBER:

2

No, I don't believe so, and I spoke

3

in error with respect to interpretation of other

instructions.

the plain meaning standard which would be equally

6

applicable to all instructions.

I believe that if there is a standard it is

QUESTION:

We do have the strong --

Mr. Weber, is this instruction

routinely used in the courts in Nebraska?

9

•k.

Have we ever suggested that?

MR. WEBER:

It is not, Your Honor.

Following

10

the decision in Cage, the -- specifically with my own

11

experience the Douglas County District Court in Omaha,

12

Nebraska, that county ceased using the instruction for the

13

most part.

14

There were subsequent decisions by certain

15

courts, specifically the supreme court of the State of

16

Nebraska, distinguishing the objectionable instruction

17

from that given in Cage, and I can note in all candor that

18

some district judges then did recommence using the

19

instructions, the instruction that is objectionable here.

20

I think it is fairly safe to say that because of

21

the state of the uncertainty with respect to the United

22

States District Court for the District of Nebraska holding

23

the distinction by the Nebraska supreme court invalid that

24

most, if not all of the courts in the State of Nebraska no

25

longer use the defective instruction and rather use the

instruction that is referred to as -- it's contained
within the appendix to counsel for Sandoval's brief at
page B-23, NJI second criminal instruction 2.0, which was
passed in 1992.
QUESTION:

Was the instruction in this case

routinely given before our decision in Cage?
MR. WEBER:
it was.

Yes, I think it would be safe to say

However, there is some authority from the Eighth

Circuit specifically with respect to using strong
probabilities language up to approximately 20 years ago
questioning that language.
I understand that the strong probabilities of
the case language has been approved in and of itself in
other decisions -- I believe in Dunbar.

However, it is

not my argument that this instruction is to be looked at
under a microscope.
In looking at Poison Pills I understand that is
not the test, but with respect to the instruction taken as
a whole in allowing conviction in this case based upon the
strong probabilities of the case, that is basically
allowing a jury to convict on a possibility of guilt,
which of course is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, I
think taking again the entire portion of the instruction
that I believe relates to conviction in context, it
reaffirms the jury's ability to find guilt on a civil -9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

what is more akin to a civil preponderance standard.
And that specifically is the sentence that
follows, "Excuse me,

" but precedes the strong

probabilities language, and that, and I quote,
find an accused guilty" -- excuse me.

"You may

"You may be

convinced of the truth of a fact beyond a reasonable doubt
and yet be fully aware that possibly you may be mistaken."
In my mind, that reaffirms -- in the plain
meaning reaffirms a jury's ability to convict on a civil
preponderance standard.

You take that hand-in-hand with

the moral certainty language contained in Cage, it even
allows the worst possible of scenarios that a jury can
convict, in this case find first degree murder,

in spite

of or on evidence other than that presented at trial.
The respondent adheres to the distinction drawn
by the Nebraska supreme court.

It adheres to a rationale

that I believe the Federal Court for the District of
Nebraska indicated called for an exercise in mental
gymnastics.

It belies logic that a juror reading this

instruction would not be reasonably likely to misapply
constitutional principles and allow conviction on
something more akin to the civil preponderance standard.
With respect to the second portion of the
instruction, acquittal is not permitted and perhaps this
is the most heinous violation of the instruction, unless

1

reasonable doubt is equivalent to a substantial doubt, and

2

I submit that very first sentence of what I have carved

3

out to be the second portion, or the acquittal portion of

4

the instruction, defines is the only real and true

5

definition of reasonable doubt.

6

QUESTION:

Well, counsel, that would, if it

7

stood alone, certainly come pretty close to Cage, but the

8

balance of the sentence explains that the reasonable doubt

9

has to be as distinguished from a doubt arising from a

10

mere possibility, bare imagination, or fanciful

11

conjecture, and viewed with that, perhaps it isn't a

12

misstatement.

13

MR. WEBER:

I understand what you're saying,

14

Justice O'Connor, with respect to reading the entire

15

sentence, but I think what we're looking at here is a

16

continuum, with mere possibility or fanciful conjecture at

17

one end, and we can't ignore the language that I believe

18

you omitted in your question, and that is the substantial

19

doubt.

20

violative of Cage.

21

substantial doubt on the other --

22

The substantial doubt, as you noted, is concededly

QUESTION:

We have mere possibility at one end,

Well, I'm not sure it is.

It was

23

included in Cage, but it isn't clear to me that that

24

standing alone would have been found to be a violation of

25

Cage.

1

MR. WEBER:

I tend to agree with you.

2

think we look at these in a vacuum, and we do not look at

3

these standing alone, much as the Respondent has attempted

4

to do, as well as the amici in this case, looking at each

5

particular term, but when you take all the terms standing

6

as a whole, the graver and more important transactions of

7

life, the moral certainty language, the strong

8

probabilities of the case language, and the actual and

9

substantial doubt, I don't think there's any question that

10

it was reasonably likely that the jury in this particular

11

case misapplied constitutional principles and deprived the

12

petitioner of due process.

13

I had anticipated your question to be that

14

perhaps the fact that the substantial doubt language

15

refers to the evidence that that somehow salvages this

16

instruction.

17

have you believe.

Indeed, that's what the Respondent would

18

The simple response is that it's irrelevant

19

whether or not the basis is the evidence or, as moral

20

certainty would suggest, something other than the evidence

21

and independent of the evidence.

22

to acquit a particular defendant, it is still

23

unconstitutional.

24
25

If the doubt is too high

I believe, again with respect to the substantial
doubt language, you take in conjunction the sentence that

1

allows the jury to consider the fact that they can convict

2

and still be aware that they're possibly mistaken

3

reaffirms in the jury's mind that the standard is not as

4

high, they may convict on a strong probability and not on

5

a reasonable doubt.

6

I feel it necessary, because it was addressed

7

within the briefs, to respond to allegations made with

8

respect to procedural bar and retroactivity in this case.

9

Indeed, the issue of retroactivity was presented in the

10
11

issue that certiorari was granted.
With respect to procedural bar, I think there

12

are several reasons why we are properly before this Court.

13

The merits were indeed addressed by the Nebraska supreme

14

court, and under Michigan v. Long I believe were properly

15

before this Court.

■v

16

Also, with respect to a distinction found in

17

Teague with respect to Harris v. Reid,

I don't believe

18

there's any ambiguity in the opinion of the Nebraska

19

supreme court concerning the merits of this case.

20

Indeed, the most recent opinion on this

21

particular instruction, State v. Cook, a Westlaw cite out

22

of Nebraska from last month, indicates that in spite of

23

this Court granting certiorari in this case, and in spite

24

of the Federal District Court for the District of Nebraska

25

holding the distinction drawn by the State of Nebraska,

the supreme court of the State of Nebraska, they would

2

adhere to their distinction drawn between this defective

3

instruction and the defective instruction in Louisiana,

4

and I believe again properly before this Court.

QUESTION:

In this case we just didn't have the

6

use of the phrase, moral certainty, by itself.

also specifically opposed to and absolute or a

8

mathematical certainty.

What kind of a

16

which is the only certainty that can be had pertaining to

MR. WEBER:

problem, Your Honor, is today moral certainty doesn't mean

today what it did at the time that the instruction was

passed, and as Sandoval counsel --

have only that meaning.

2

and indeed, quite contrary meaning, but at least when it's

3

used in a charge that opposes it to mathematical

4

certainty.

5

can understand the argument, but if it says, you know, it

6

must be to a moral certainty, not a mathematical

7

certainty, what other possible meaning could it have than

8

the old meaning of moral certainty?

9

Maybe it has acquired another,

I mean, if I just said moral certainty, then I

MR. WEBER:

That's the problem, Justice Scalia,

10

it has several different meanings.

11

possible that someone will properly interpret the term,

12

moral certainty, in and of itself to mean something that

13

it is supposed to mean, but is it reasonably likely,

14

taking that instruction in context, the meaning moral

15

certainty is the same as a civil preponderance standard,

16

which is almost what the instruction says?

17

QUESTION:

It is certainly

It's your burden to show that it has

18

to be reasonably likely that it would be misunderstood,

19

isn't it?

20

MR. WEBER:

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, it is.

Well then, what line of reasoning

22

would say that moral certainty means roughly like the

civil preponderance standard?

1

as the prior decisions of this Court have noted, we are

2

not necessarily to parse language and view the particular

3

terms under a microscope, and I'm saying it is certainly

4

possible, indeed, reasonably likely, that a jury looking

5

at the moral certainty language and noting that they can

6

convict on the strong probabilities of the case that those

7

are tantamount to similar or same meanings, and it's

8

reasonably likely that they will be given that meaning by

9

a j ury.

10

QUESTION:

So you say that because of the

11

juxtaposition of moral certainty and strong probabilities

12

that that gives meaning to moral certainty?

13

MR. WEBER:

To me I believe it does, and I

14

believe it does to the common juror, and I believe that's

15

what we need to focus upon here.

16

noted in the briefs, the Court and certainly counsel have

17

focused upon these terms ad nauseam.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. WEBER:

Obviously, as I think is

Inordinately.
Yes, and the problem is that we

20

maybe have removed ourselves too far from what the common

21

juror on the street is going to think when they look at

22

this instruction, and if we're to do the best we can and

23

look at the instruction as a whole, I don't think there's

24

any question when you look at what I submit is the

25

conviction language, and that takes the graver more

1

important transactions of life language, the moral

2

certainty language, and the strong probability language

3

taken together.

4

It certainly on a continuum pushes the standard

5

much, much closer to what would be the same as a civil

6

greater weight of the evidence -- the reaffirmation that

7

you can find the defendant guilty by the greater weight of

8

the evidence, read greater weight of the evidence and

9

still be aware of the possibility that you may be

10

mistaken, I think is consistent with what a reasonable

11

juror would look at.

12

\

QUESTION:

Well, wait, I certainly don't agree

13

with that as to the first sentence, as to the "such a

14

doubt as would cause a reasonable and prudent person in

15

one of the graver, more important transactions of life to

16

pause and hesitate before taking the representative facts

17

as true."

18

Are you saying you only pause or hesitate when

19

the fact is -- you only pause or hesitate when the fact is

20

true by a bare preponderance of the evidence?

21

MR. WEBER:

22

QUESTION:

No, that's not what I'm saying.
I don't think so.

I think it takes

23

much more certainty than that to eliminate any hesitation

24

on my part.

MR. WEBER:

Certainly, but another reading of

that instruction would be that possibly the decision to

2

acquit in this case could be grave and thus, again,

3

raising the burden of the defendant unconstitutionally.

4
5

QUESTION:

I don't understand what you're

saying.

6

MR. WEBER:

7

QUESTION:

If -I take that first sentence to define

8

reasonable doubt in such a way to say the kind of doubt

9

that would cause you to pause.

10

Well, boy, I pause

somewhat well short of preponderance.
MR. WEBER:

11

But I also think the more clear

12

definition of reasonable doubt provided in the instruction

13

is the one at the conclusion of the instruction, that

14

being a reasonable doubt is an actual and substantial

15

doubt.

Regarding the Sandoval instruction, the first

point I would like to emphasize is that this instruction

MR. MULTHAUP:

That's certainly true, Your

as law-trained people hear this phrase as reiterating what

understands it in a very different manner, and they're --

the defendants, and might it not be that the defendants'

What I would recommend as the simplest solution

2

to the California quandary would be to take the rendition

3

given by Professor Shapiro in her article in the thirtieth

4

Hastings Law Review, where she took -- set forth in full

5

in the petitioner's brief at a footnote on approximately

6

page 35, where she took the Webster instruction -- she's a

7

historian and rhetoricist at Cal, and immersed herself in

8

the history of what reasonable doubt was supposed to mean,

9

and then rendered the Webster instruction into

10

contemporary English, and it starts off with some of the

11

exact phrases that Your Honor uses.
QUESTION:

12

3

I agree with you that that would be a

better idea.

MR. MULTHAUP:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

whether it was likely that not doing that -- likely that

7

not doing that misled the jury.
Now, in this instruction the word, moral, was

9

used a couple of times, not just used in the phrase, moral

certainty.

Earlier the judge said, "It is not a mere

possible doubt, because everything related to human

possible or imaginary doubt."

We

10

standard of certainty has to be way up there at the top of

the ladder of evidentiary certainty.

12

QUESTION:

I agree with you, but you're making

3

the argument that the only meaning this jury could have

taken, or it is more likely than not that the jury took

-- and I say that it is very likely

that they took it to mean that, since earlier the judge

refers to moral evidence, and in that context the only

thing it could have meant to the jury is evidence relating

to human action, and moral certainty means that certainty

going -- is it going to resound in their minds as

Indeed,

that is illustrated by the reply brief of the petitioner.

Well, I think on the record

4

here it's a little unclear as to whether we're on direct

5

review or not, Your Honor, but I would note that the

6

petitioner in his reply brief -- Petitioner Victor in his

7

reply brief argues that even under the Teague standard,

8

because this is so fundamental, because the reasonable

9

doubt jury instruction is so fundamental, it is part of

20

the concept of ordered liberty, that if the instruction is

21

invalid, that we would have to go back under a Teague test

22

as well, and that, of course, is not the position of the

State of Nebraska.

1

you don't have to reach that issue.

2

the Teague problem, isn't the answer to that that the law

3

as announced in Cage had been announced prior to the

4

exhaustion of direct review in this case?

5

GENERAL STENBERG:

If somebody raises

Well, I guess my response,

6

Your Honor, would be that there's no question that we're

7

looking at several -- that obviously retroactivity affects

8

exactly how many cases are affected, but I don't think

9

there's any question that we're looking at several years'

10

worth of retrials if these jury instructions are broadly

11

rejected by this Court.

12

QUESTION:

Has the defense bar been regularly

13

objecting to all these instructions?

14

GENERAL STENBERG:

I think since Cage there has

15

been a pretty general -- it's been a fairly standard

16

objection to object to reasonable doubt jury instructions,

17

Your Honor.

18

QUESTION:

Of course, prior to Cage, at least

19

with respect to cases prior to Cage in which there were

20

not objections, for example, as I understand it we don't

21

know and we couldn't possibly tell on this record whether

22

the supreme court of Nebraska will find a complete

23

procedural bar.

24
25

They simply skipped over that issue because they
thought it was easier to decide it on the merits, but if

1

we reverse on the merits, that tells you nothing one way

2

or the other about the existence of procedural bars with

3

respect, for example, to those who may not have been

4

obj ecting.

5

GENERAL STENBERG:

Well, that, of course, is

6

exactly the argument we make on retroactivity in our

7

brief, Your Honor.

8

9

Turning, I guess, to some of the phrases, and I
remind myself as I do this that we're not supposed to do

10

this -- we're not supposed to look at these in isolation,

11

but I guess there's no other way to talk about it.
Now, I'll start with the term, substantial

12

13

doubt.

14

substantial has more than one meaning.

15

certainly can mean a large amount of something, such as

16

"the rich woman has a substantial amount of money," but

17

substantial has other meanings as well.

18

Like many words in the English language,
Substantial

For example, a Nebraskan might say, "My great­

19

grandfather and grandmother homesteaded Nebraska and they

20

built a small, one-room sod house, but it was a

21

substantial structure able to withstand the strong winds

22

of the prairies."

23

So substantial has more than one meaning.

24

can mean something solid, and in fact, to turn to our

25

dictionary, Webster's Third International Dictionary
44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

It

1

defines substantial as "consisting of or constituting

2

substance, not seeming or imaginative, not illusive," and

3

it is that meaning which is used in the Nebraska jury

4

instruction, and if we look at the entire sentence in

5

which the term, substantial doubt, is used in our

6

instruction, it is clear that that is what is meant.

7

In the Joint Appendix on page 11, that part of

8

the instruction reads as follows:

"A reasonable doubt is

9

an actual and substantial doubt reasonably arising from

10

the evidence, from the facts or circumstances shown by the

11

evidence, or from the lack of evidence on the part of the

12

State, as distinguished from a doubt arising from mere

13

possibility, from bare imagination, or from fanciful

14

conj ecture."

15

So substantial doesn't always mean a large

16

quantity.

17

simply imaginary, and that is the way it is used in the

18

Nebraska jury instruction, and I think it is clear from

19

the context.

20

It can mean, solid, something that is not

Strong probabilities language is also objected

21

to, and I think a mere reading of the sentence in which

22

that language appears answers the objection.

23

sentence reads as follows:

25

such probabilities are strong enough to exclude any doubt

and it certainly would be a great disservice to those

2

States to now invalidate carefully written instructions

3

based on this Court's own sentences, and certainly that

4

should not be done for any light reason, and great

5

deference should be given to the States in their decision

6

to employ this language.

QUESTION:

Do you acknowledge that the meaning

of the phrase, moral certainty, has changed over time?
GENERAL STENBERG:

9

I do not believe so, Your

what moral certainty means.

abortion was wrong, morally certain as used in that

The juror has to be as sure as the juror can

the review done by the CALJIC committee in 1987 pursuant

9

to a request by the legislature to look at this

10

instruction and to judge whether or not we should maintain

11

that instruction, give no instruction whatsoever, or give

12

another instruction.

13

The committee was made up of both prosecutors

14

and defense counsel and judges, including a Federal

15

appellate justice, and the consensus at that time was that

16

no change ought to be made, and of the minority report --

17

a small minority, but in the minority report there was no

18

consensus as what ought to be done in its place.
And the reason I bring this up is that we all

agree there can be no perfect way of defining reasonable

Rather, this Court, by not prescribing or

judgment as long as they meet the standard of reasonable

doubt, or unreasonable doubt -- or reasonable doubt has

13

been suggested constitutionally in the context of the Due

14

Process Clause, and I would suggest that we might look at

15

In Re Winship to see what, in fact, this Court believed

16

what was so essential to the beyond a reasonable doubt

17

instruction or concept that it was incorporated into our

18

belief of due process.

19

In Re Winship, in quoting Davis, a previous U.S.

20

Supreme Court case, said that no man should be deprived of

21

life under the forums of law unless the jurors are able

22

upon their consciences to say that the evidence before

23

them is sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt the

24

existence of every fact necessary to constitute the crime

charged.

The essential connection there is that the

1

2

beyond a reasonable doubt standard protects the defendant

3

and enforces or reinforces the obligation or burden on the

4

State for proof, to carry the burden of proof of one's

5

guilt.

6

Further, referring to In Re Winship on page 364,

7

the Court referred to two -- I would say two definitions

8

that I find virtually synonymous with moral certainty.

9

That is, they talked about the subjective state of

10

certitude, and they also spoke of the utmost certainty.

11

I believe that if you interjected those words

12

into, to a moral certainty, found in the California

13

instruction, they would mean virtually the same thing.

GENERAL LUNGREN:

Some have suggested that it is

better not to have any instruction whatsoever, and to just

that doubt which is not reasonable, and leave it at that,

A grave uncertainty in Cage implicates to the
juror that that manner, that amount of doubt necessary to
acquit, is more than what is constitutionally permissible,
or in many ways -- you can look at it either from that
standpoint or say, by virtue of so changing the amount of
doubt necessary to acquit, you basically have shifted the
burden of proof from the State to the defendant, and
obviously that is -- does not meet constitutional standard
in any regard.
At the very least we can say that Cage thereby
exaggerated or overstated the doubt necessary to acquit.
There is no problem like that in the California
instruction whatsoever.

There is no -- as our California

supreme court said in viewing this in People v. Jennings,
there is no transformation of true, reasonable doubt as it
has been traditionally defined into a higher degree of
doubt.
We also do not have the words, actual or
substantial, although I think the real problem in Cage is
the context in which actual, substantial were found, and
again it gave an equivalency, a rough equivalency to the
notion of reasonable doubt, unadorned whatsoever.

there is any difficulty in them understanding it.

7

legions of individuals are going to be affected, in

8

essence, the doors of the prisons left wide open in the

9

State of Nebraska because of the throwing out of this

invalid instruction, but I believe Justice Souter

recognized that this fear, as I've said before, is a gross

exaggeration.

all, individuals similarly situated to the petitioner in

May I ask on that point, is the

I

believe that just the mere fact that that language happens

number 1, that's not the issue in this case, but number 2,
it's directly addressed by the Nebraska supreme court in
the case of the State v. Van Akron, in which, similar to
Cage, the Court recognized the plain error analysis
ability to review the instruction, and quite frankly, as
the Court noted in that opinion, the raising of that issue
at trial, much for the same reason it wasn't raised at
trial in this case, was due to the futility of raising it
in light of its prior decisions distinguishing the
instruction given in Nebraska from the defective
instruction in Cage.
Finally, I find it very interesting that the
Attorney General concedes at the beginning that we're not
supposed to parse language and look at the individual
terms, and yet he spends a great deal of his time arguing
about -- I see my time is up.
