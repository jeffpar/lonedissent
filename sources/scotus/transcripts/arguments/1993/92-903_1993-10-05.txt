ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALFREDO PARRISH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. PARRISH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We're here today discussing 21 U.S.C. 857, which

12

is referred to and I will refer to it as the drug

13

paraphernalia statute.

14

contains a subjective scienter, and when the trial judge

15

applied 857 without a subjective scienter in his

16

instructions 37 and 39, did he deny the petitioner her due

17

process rights?

18

The question is whether or not it

The court, we believe, erroneously applied 857,

19

because when it instructed the jury it instructed the jury

20

without any intent requirement.

21

this statute does not contain any intent requirement, as

22

the trial judge found and the Eighth Circuit affirmed,

23

then the statute is unconstitutional and the conviction

24

cannot stand.

25

QUESTION:

On the other hand, if

What is your authority for that

latter proposition, Mr. Parrish?

2

MR. PARRISH:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. PARRISH:

That is cannot stand?

That it's unconstitutional.
If it's un -- it's based upon the

5

concept that a mens rea requirement is read into a

6

statute.

7

to look at the legislative history to try to find it.

8

9
10
11

If it's not read into a statute, then you have

QUESTION:

But I thought you said if there's no

mens rea requirement it's unconstitutional, and I asked
you what your authority is for that proposition.
MR. PARRISH:

The authority that we have for

12

that proposition is the Morissette v. -- the Morissette

13

case is what we use for that.

14

QUESTION:

I reread the Morissette case because

15

you cite it in your brief, and I didn't read that as

16

saying anything about a lack of intent making a statute

17

unconstitutional.

18

MR. PARRISH:

Well, the Morissette case dealt

19

with the fact of whether or not you should look to other

20

instances to determine whether or not a statute should be

21

declared unconstitutional.

22

it, if no mens rea requirement is in it, then we believe

23

you have to look at the intent of the legislature.

24
25

QUESTION:

If no mens rea statute is in

Well, how does that get you to any

constitutional proposition?

MR. PARRISH:

1

We don't believe you have to reach

2

the constitutional proposition in order to remand this

3

case to the Eighth Circuit.
QUESTION:

4

Well, then your principal -- the

5

principal authority on which you rely for the proposition

6

that if the statute does not have an intent requirement,

7

it is unconstitutional, is Morissette.
MR. PARRISH:

8

9

The Morissette case.

Also it

seems to be indicated in the Hoffman's Estates case also,

10

because in that decision the Court indicates that -- in

11

their questioning to counsel and also in the decision,

12

that some intent must be found in the statute to save its

13

vagueness.

14

So we talk about that over and over again in the

15

line of cases that follow the Hoffman Estates case.

16

look for some intent.

17

cases and in preenforcement challenges to the facial

18

constitutionality of the statute, the Court seems to save

19

it solely because there is some intent requirement in the

20

statute.

21

22

QUESTION:

However, those were preenforcement

Are you referring to this Court or

other courts?

MR. PARRISH:

You take the position that the

instructions didn't require proof of any mental element.

What do you make of the language of the charge that the

2

jury must find that the Government had proven that the

3

defendants understood they -- or knew the nature and

4

character of the items?
MR. PARRISH:

5

Well, in their approach on that

6

issue, that's not the case that was tried by the district

7

court judge.

most of the courts have used to determine where the intent

is in this case --as used in these instructions does not

9

MR. PARRISH:
QUESTION:

10

Now that's a mens rea

It is a mens rea component.

And so the defendant had to know the

11

nature and character of the item.

12

the later instructions they said that there's no intent of

13

any person that's required, but that simply means that the

14

item itself is what the court and the jury should focus

15

on.

The

term is defined as items either designed for or intended

for us in connection with drug use.

certain items that are designed for drug use and that have

2

little other purpose?

3

and someone knows what the object is, as the instructions

4

require, that that's sufficient.

5

MR. PARRISH:

6

It's not sufficient because these

statutes have -- these items have dual purposes.

7
8

And if they're designed for that

QUESTION:

Well, I thought there were an array

of items here, some of them being such things as are
defined by the statute itself as being designed for drug

10

use.

11

bongs and other items that apparently have little other

12

purpose.

13

I don't know the names for all these things, but

MR. PARRISH:

Well, designed for use goes to the

14

intent of the manufacturer.

15

primarily intended, it goes to the person who uses the

16

item.

17
18

The seller, in this case, has nothing.
QUESTION:

Well, we may have two separate

categories of items here.

instructions deficient?

MR. PARRISH:

In designed for use it goes to the

manufacturer.

5

she can't be held liable or the jury find her intent based

upon who designed it.

She was not the designer, so consequently

QUESTION:
use

If you go to primary intent --

Well

if the item is designed for that

andno other and the statute says if you sell such

items you're guilty of this offense, why isn't that
10
11

sufficient?
MR. PARRISH:

You're convicting the item.

It

12

would be insufficient because the jury has no idea on

13

dual-purpose items unless you tell them that it goes to

14

the intent of the person who does, in fact, use the item.

15

QUESTION:

Well

I'm not going to belabor it, but

16

it seems to me there are two types of items.

17

dual purpose at all.

MR. PARRISH:

Some are

Some are not, that is correct.

Maybe some are.
But you can't tell by the way the

21

court instructed the jury in 37 and 3 .

You can't tell

And

1

Government had the benefit and the defendant had no

2

opportunity at all to make any determination as to whether

3

or not the jury could determine whether or not they were

dual-purpose items.
And that's the problem with statutes like this,

because you have dual-purpose items and you don't tell the

jury -QUESTION:

Mr. Parrish, the judge in his charge

three times told the jury that the defendant whose case

the jury was considering had to know the nature and

11

character of the items.

12

repeated in instruction 21, 22, and was it 18?

13

MR. PARRISH:

14

QUESTION:

So you say even though that was

That's correct.

You say that although he repeated

15

that the defendant must know the nature and character of

16

the items, that that's wiped out?

It was clearly an objective law of the case that

the Government did prove that the defendant knew the

nature and character of the items that were sold in her

shop,

use - - that their primary use was in connection with

10

that she knew that they were primarily designed for

illegal drugs?
MR. PARRISH:

11

If you consider proof what the

12

jury reached a verdict on without proper instructions, you

13

would have to say yes,

14

QUESTION:

they did prove it.

Proof is what is adequate to go to

15

the jury,

16

proof for the jury to find that the defendant knew that

17

the primary use of these items was in connection with

18

illegal drugs?

19

not what the jury finds.

MR. PARRISH:

Was there sufficient

We don't agree with that.

We

20

think the evidence was conflicting.

21

witnesses who testified in the record on this case all

22

indicated that all of these items had dual purposes.

23

consequently when they had dual purposes,

24

direct the jury someplace to find the subjective intent of

the person.

the court had to

So where did they direct them?

So

They have to

1

direct them to primarily intended.
As a matter of fact, Congressman Levine, the

2

3

principal author of this statute, indicated --

4

QUESTION:

I'm not sure I understand your

5

question -- your response.

6

specifically enumerated in the statute.

7

MR. PARRISH:

8

QUESTION:

9

Some of these items were

That's correct.

Justice O'Connor mentioned those.

Are you saying that the Government did not prove, so that

10

a jury could not find the defendant knew the primary use

11

of bongs and roach clips was in connection with illegal

12

drugs?

13

MR. PARRISH:

We believe that the Government did

14

not prove that; that there was not substantial evidence,

15

due to the conflicting nature of it without some

16

indication to this jury that the subjective intent, what

17

Ms. Acty intended that these items go for, was given to

18

the jury.

19

The jury had no direction with regard to that.

20

Sure enough, the Government now wants to come back and

21

claim a knowledge standard, but that's after the fact, the

22

knowledge standard.

23

to the Court --we believe a fatal flaw exists in their

24

argument, if you'll turn to page 19 of their brief.

25

In their knowledge standard argument

In their argument they say:

"Consistent with

this view, the district court instructed the jury that the

2

term primarily intended was not limited to the intent of

3

the defendant or any particular person or persons."

4

they had given that instruction, we wouldn't be here

5

today.
They didn't give that instruction.

6

If

They didn't

say it was not limited to.

8

instruction that was given, the court said on page 31 of

the Joint Appendix:

that the judge's instruction was that the so-called

3

QUESTION:

All right.

All right.

If you're

wrong on that, do you lose the case?
MR. PARRISH:

Well, we don't lose the case

4

because the Government argues a knowledge instruction.

5

However, the court never gave a sufficient knowledge

6

instruction to alert the jury to the difficulty that

7

existed when they went back into the jury room to

8

deliberate.
QUESTION:

Well, you don't deny, as Justice

10

Ginsburg pointed out, do you, that on three separate

11

occasions the judge gave this understanding of nature and

12

character instruction?

13

MR. PARRISH:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. PARRISH:

16

QUESTION:

You don't deny that.
But nature and character --

Well, do you?
I don't deny that.

Okay.

So that your argument is, I

17

take it, that the jury instruction was confusing and that

18

even though there was a mens rea element required, in the

1

context of the whole instruction the jury wouldn't have

20

understood it.

21

Is that your argument?

MR. PARRISH:

That's correct.

But also our

22

argument is that when you're talking about -- we're maybe

23

arguing over general and specific intent.

24

about a punishment here where an individual is going to

25

prison up to 20 years and facing a $500,000 fine.

We're talking

So when

1

you're talking about that, you don't talk about using the

2

same standards as we've used here for public welfare-type

3

crimes or the crimes where knowledge has just been the

4

type of thing that we allow people to be convicted on.

QUESTION:

MR. PARRISH:

9

You -We're talking about sending people

away for a long time.
QUESTION:

You then are -- and I didn't get this

from your brief, but are you arguing that instead of

10

knowledge, which the Government concedes must -- knowledge

11

in the sense the Government described it must be proven,

12

that this must be a purposeful crime?

13

MR. PARRISH:

It should be purposeful, based

14

upon -- and getting back to Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist's

15

question of the standard that has been utilized, this

16

Court has never actually confronted the mens rea standard

17

at the constitutional level.

18

QUESTION:

Is that true with respect to both

19

kinds of items?

We have here the listed items, the items

20

set forth in the statute, and then the catchall

21

classification of items.

22

MR. PARRISH:

And is your answer the same with

Mr. Parrish, there are all sorts of

If they say it's -- they can.

very clear that the Government must prove this defendant

knew that the primary use -- not the exclusive use, the

primary use of this substance is in connection with

construction of the statute?

The statute -- now we have -- we're eliminating

entirely the element of confusion.

the requirement is that the defendant must know that the

I think we certainly changed

17

our approach to the case in this respect,

defendants was that a subjective intent was required.

20

That is -- and this was the basis for the objections that

were made in the district court -- that the defendant

herself had to have designed or intended the drug use.

the district court proceeding.

3

the argument was made - - the principal argument made by

the defendants was that this statute has no scienter

requirement at all and therefore is unconstitutional.

4

I think that's the gist of it.

Do you think the jury understood it

that way?
MR. BRYSON:

Well, I think so.

Because the jury

was fully apprised of the fact that the goods had to be

designed or intended for use with drugs, and that the

defendant had to know that, had to know of the nature and

character and use of the goods.

that the defendant must know that the goods are -- the

goods in question are primarily used with drugs.

just three, but I think five different places in the

13

instructions that the reference to nature and character or

nature and character and use -- nature, character, and use

15

of the goods is explained as the basis for the knowledge

The court -- the
The

1

use of the items being sold or offered for sale at the

2

store."

3

Again, instruction 18, where the court is

4

discussing the evidence which has been offered on the good

5

faith defense, the court says that you can consider the

6

good faith if it's "inconsistent with the elements in the

7

charges of the indictment concerning the alleged knowledge

8

of the defendants as to the nature, character, and use of

9

the items being sold or offered for sale at the store."

10

That's at page 20 of the Joint Appendix.

11

Then in the two instructions on counts 20 --

12

excuse me, on counts 1 and 2 at pages 21 and 22 of the

13

Joint Appendix, the court not only instructs that the

14

defendant whose case you are considering must know the

15

nature and character of the items, but also adds that

16

there must be proof that the use of the interstate

17

conveyance was, quote, part of a scheme to sell drug

18

paraphernalia.

19

Now, we think that the term "scheme" there is

20

important, not only in establishing a mens rea requirement

21

in section 857(a), but also in informing the jury that

22

this is something that they had to know was --

1

QUESTION:

So you don't want to - - even though

2

it was in effect at the time of this trial, it seems by

3

putting any heavy weight on that you're making this an

4

extremely narrow case.

5

MR. BRYSON:

Your Honor, we don't think the

6

existence of the word "scheme" in the 857 -- the prior

7

statute is critical, but we think it's illuminating,

8

particularly because there's no indication that when the

9

1990 change was made in the statute and the word "scheme"

10

was dropped in the course of jumbling up the section (a),

11

that there was any -- there's no indication there was any

12

intention to remove a mens rea requirement.

13

So what we make of the word "scheme" in section

14

857(a) is that it reflects a congressional understanding

15

that there would be a knowledge requirement, that there

16

would be awareness on the part of the defendant that the

17

defendant was doing something unlawful, and that there was

18

no indication in 1990 that that fundamental change --

19

excuse me - - change in the statute was intended.

20

So, yes, we don't put principal weight on the

21

word "scheme," but we certainly think it's illuminating in

22

telling us what Congress had in mind.

23

light of the fact that we're dealing here with what

24

amounts to a presumption in the construction of Federal

25

statutes that you find mens rea unless there's some clear

indication to the contrary, or unless you're in an area

2

involving particular kinds of products.

3

we think that assumption, that rule of construction

4

applies.

5

that that rule is applicable here.

And the word "scheme" is a further indication

QUESTION:

6

Now, in this area

Mr. Bryson, can I just ask, is your

7

acceptance of the view that there is some knowledge

8

requirement in the statute based on your view that this is

9

a strong canon of presumption under the canons of

10

statutory construction, or are you of the view that if you

11

didn't do that it might be a serious constitutional

12

question?

13
14
15

Well, maybe that's also a presumption.

Why do

you make the concession is what I'm asking you?
MR. BRYSON:

Well, we make the concession

16

because we think that -- I would say it's the first,

17

principally, of your --of the two options.

18

if you read the Court's cases such as Gypsum, Bailey,

19

Liparota, and Morissette, what you find is there is this

20

canon of construction.

21

We think that

And in a sense it's just like the rule that this

22

court has recognized, that you read into Federal statutes

23

the defense of entrapment.

24

of entrapment, but we understand Congress to legislate

25

against a background in which Federal criminal statutes

contrary.

This is just one of

Now, one of the reasons for that, of course,

8

is

9

that there are constitutional concerns with statutes that

10

have absolutely no mens rea except where certain kinds of

11

items are at issue, and the International Minerals case

12

discusses that concern.

construction.

Mr. Bryson,

this may be just

11

repeating what Justice Stevens was asking, but I take it

12

it is your position that the statute is covered if all

13

that the seller knows is that the individual to whom he's

14

selling the dual-purpose item in fact intends to use it

15

for one of the prohibited purposes?

16

So that if -- you know,

if I'm a clerk in a drug

17

store and I have a friend who I know is a drug addict and

18

he comes in - - and I know that he doesn't use this type of

19

razor when he shaves, and he comes in and asks for a pack

20

of razors and I just give him a pack over the counter.

21

know very well what he's going to use them for.

22

would violate the statute.

23

MR. BRYSON:

Your Honor,

I

That

I have to give you the

24

same answer I gave to Justice Stevens.

25

that is right at the edge of what the statute covers and

that, yes, I think it probably would cover that.
QUESTION:

And that's why we have prosecutorial

discretion, is what you're saying.
MR. BRYSON:

Well, Your Honor, I'm always

5

worried to give the answer trust us, we won't prosecute

6

those kinds of cases, because I find that those cases show

7

up in my office when I get back.

QUESTION:

(Laughter.)

10

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Bryson, I don't mean to - -

My example was the kit where you

11

don't assemble all the items except for that purpose.

12

I'm not sure if you have a dual-purpose item, the primary

13

intent of which is taking it and shaving yourself, the

14

fact that a particular individual uses it for a drug

15

purpose would make it covered by the statute.

16

MR. BRYSON:

It might not, Your Honor.

But

But my

17

argument -- my analysis of that point would be as follows,

18

that if you have a primary use for razor blades, being to

19

use them to shave as you obviously do, but in your

20

particular store you put a display out on the counter

21

which says these razor blades are really well suited for

22

cocaine use -- let's just make it easy.

23

And there's -- let's assume there isn't even

24

anything all that special about these, but you've

25

advertised them for cocaine use and you say these are

great cocaine razors, and you put a little picture on

then I think you have defined a little

QUESTION:

No, but if I come in and say I'm sure

6

they are,

be clean shaven, please sell me a package, there's no

violation of the statute in that sale,

9

indeed, suitable for that purpose, but I want to

MR. BRYSON:

is there?

Well, actually, I think there would

10

be, Your Honor.

11

would be doing as a clerk is that I would be selling

12

something which is intended for - - primarily intended for

13

use with cocaine - -

QUESTION:

MR. BRYSON:

16

Because what you would be doing -- I

Intended by whom?
To somebody who just happens not to

have intended to use it for that purpose.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. BRYSON:

Not by me, not by me?
But that doesn't exonerate me.

And

19

let me give you the example that seems to me to

20

demonstrate that.

21

and you come in - - and I know you're not going to use this

22

for drug purposes,

officer.

24

25

personally may not be intending to use it for that

purpose.
QUESTION:

Then, your -- and I -- this is

3

implicit in what you said before -- your reference to

primarily intended by the customer to whom you address

MR. BRYSON:

QUESTION:

10

No, no, Your Honor.

It's the --

I mean to the class of customers to

whom you address your offer.
MR. BRYSON:

Yes, that's correct.

That,

in

11

other words, the intent may be reflected in the way the

12

product is marketed.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BRYSON:

15

QUESTION:

Uh-hum.
That's right.
I thought you said - - I thought you

16

agreed with the instruction that it doesn't have to be the

17

intent of any particular person.

18

the manufacturer's intent,

19

it can be the purchaser's intent.

20

MR. BRYSON:

21

QUESTION:

It seems to me it can be

it can be the seller's intent,

Exactly.
So that if I come -- that's why you

22

had trouble with my hypothetical.

23

who's just a druggist and I say sell me a - - sell me some

24

razor blades because I want to use it to cut drugs.

25

that would be the necessary intent, wouldn't it, on the

And

1

part of the purchaser?
MR. BRYSON:

2

Well, the argument you would have

3

to make to bring that example within the coverage of the

4

statute, I think, is that the good becomes intended to be

5

used with drugs at the point at which you walk in, pick it

6

up, and announce that you intend to use it for that

7

purpose. I think that's stretching what the statute was

8

designed to reach, but I think it does come within the

9

plain language of the statute.
If there are no further questions, I have

10
11

nothing further.

we would, in fact, have accepted in this trial.

Unfortunately, it was not the instruction that was given.

these goods are primarily used with drugs, you would have

that's correct.
QUESTION:

I know that's your -- your view is

that that confuses things, but I just wanted to know that

you are in agreement with Mr. Bryson that the model charge

would be that the defendant knows the goods are primarily
