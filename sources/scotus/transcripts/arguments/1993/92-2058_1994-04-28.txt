CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Hipp.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH B. HIPP

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HIPP:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case is about the scope of the minor

10
11

dispute resolution procedure of the Railway Labor Act, and

12

whether an airline employee can abandon that procedure and

13

go to State court with a State tort claim of wrongful

14

discharge.

15

This Court has repeatedly recognized that

16

Congress, in establishing the Railway Labor Act, set up a

17

comprehensive, indeed, pioneering alternative dispute

18

resolution procedure for adjusting minor disputes between

19

employees and employers without lawsuits and without

20

strikes.

21

Furthermore, as all the parties in this case

22

accept, the minor dispute resolution procedure within the

23

Railway Labor Act, section 204, must go through the

24

mandatory arbitration procedures of the adjustment board

25

in the absence of concurrent jurisdiction pursuant to

2

congressional act.
Where we part company with the Hawaii court,

3

with the respondent, and with the Solicitor General is in

4

defining the scope of the jurisdictional language of

5

section 204.

6

in our brief, our opponent's positions concerning the

7

scope of section 204 are flawed because they attempt to

8

rewrite the plain language of section 204 and other

9

provisions of the Railway Labor Act, and they misconstrue

In our view, and as we have argued at length

10

the Railway Labor Act's legislative history and this

11

Court's decisions interpreting the RLA.

12

If this Court were to accept our opponent's

13

views, the result would greatly undermine Congress' scheme

14

for resolving employment disputes, and it would do that by

15

undercutting the historic legislative tradeoff that took

16

place in 1934, whereby unions and employees achieved the

17

mandatory arbitration procedures of the Railway Labor Act

18

in return for giving up their right to go to court and

19

their right to strike.

20

As this Court recognized in the Chicago River

21

and Indiana Railroad case, that tradeoff was fundamental

22

to the 1934 amendments to the RLA prior to the enactment

23

in 1936 of section 204.

QUESTION:

Mr. Hipp, you seem to be arguing for

a different standard under the RLA than that under Lingle

and under the National Labor Relations Act.

2

sure -- how do you justify application of such a different

3

standard?
MR. HIPP:

4

I'm not

Your Honor, the touchstone for

5

preemption, as in fact the Court recognized in Lingle, is

6

not to apply some procrustean approach, but instead to

7

look at the purposes of Congress in each scheme.
What was the purpose of Congress in section 301?

8

9

The purpose of Congress was to assure common

10

interpretation of collective bargaining agreements

11

pursuant to Federal common law.

12

alternative dispute resolution there.

13

of any arbitral forum there.

14

There's no mention of
There's no mention

What is the purpose of the Railway Labor Act?

15

The purpose of the Railway Labor Act is to provide a

16

method, a comprehensive method for resolving disputes

17

between employers and employees.

18

2 First of the Railway Labor act, Congress has made the

19

determination that it is these kinds of disputes between

20

employers and employees that leads to disruption of

21

interstate commerce, therefore Congress set up, in section

22

3 First (i) for the railroad industry and in section 204

23

for the airline industry, a method for resolving those

24

disputes.

25

If you look at section

The method is an arbitral or adjustment board

1

method, and a scope of jurisdiction is stated there.

2

is a congressional scope of jurisdiction.

3

unlike Lingle, which addresses Congress' concerns related

4

to interpretation of the collective bargaining agreements,

5

Congress had a different agenda in 204 and 3 First (i).
QUESTION:

6

It

Therefore,

But I suppose Congress didn't intend

7

to entirely preempt ordinary State laws, even in the

8

transportation industry, having -- I guess we've upheld

9

State requirements that the train have a caboose, and one

10

thing and another, and so obviously we have said there is

11

room for application of State law --

12

MR. HIPP:

That's correct.

13

QUESTION:

-- even under the RLA.

14

MR. HIPP:

That's correct, Your Honor, and that

15

is because you must address the congressional purposes of

16

the RLA.

17

The RLA was designed to deal with disputes

18

between employees and employers.

19

deal with whether or not a State established a minimum

20

substantive standard such as a caboose.

It was not designed to

21

If you have a regulatory agency in a State that

22

says -- and the State makes the determination through its

23

legislative process that State may have a caboose law, it

24

doesn't have anything to do with the Railway Labor Act.

25

QUESTION:

Well, the State perhaps could

1

arguably have made a conscious decision, by the passage of

2

whistleblower statutes, that this is a means of assuring

3

public safety.
MR. HIPP:

4

They can make that determination, but

5

what they cannot do, Your Honor -- and this is what the

6

Andrews case in essence holds -- is that they cannot take

7

a dispute between an employee and an employer in the

8

airline or railroad industry and convert that dispute into

9

a State law claim, taking it out of the adjustment board

10

process.
Why not?

11
12

Because

Congress recognized --

13
14

Why can't they do that?

QUESTION:

Well, they haven't taken it out.

They've added, perhaps.

15

MR. HIPP:

Well, this raises the specter, again,

16

of what happened when this Court in the Moore case years

17

ago established this concurrent jurisdiction concept,

18

whereby you could go both to State court, and you could go

19

to the adjustment board procedure.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Buell, as I understand your

21

argument, you're not arguing that the RLA preempts State

22

law at all.

23

all.

24

State law applies, but it has to be applied through the

25

arbitration procedure of the RLA, isn't that correct?

It's not a preemption claim you're making at

It's an exclusive jurisdiction claim.

You're saying

MR. HIPP:

No, Your Honor, that's not correct.

2

QUESTION:

That's not correct.

3

You're saying

State law is preempted, so the State law does not exist.
MR. HIPP:

4

The State law does not exist in the

5

situation where there's a dispute between the employer and

6

the employee covered by these mandatory adjustment

Where the dispute concerns an issue

of State law, there no longer is a dispute, so you don't

have to go to arbitration, then.

11

ineffective, is that what you're saying?

You say the State law is

12

MR. HIPP:

No, I'm not saying that, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION:

It is effective.

14

MR. HIPP:

It is effective, correct.

15

QUESTION:

Then it's not preempted.

16

MR. HIPP:

No, I'm sorry, Your Honor.

It is

17

preempted.

substance --

If your question, Your Honor, is directed at

Does State law apply?

Is the State

law applicable --

MR. HIPP:

-- to the employment relationship?

Can the State law govern it?

Yes, Your Honor, it can, depending

1

upon whether or not it is regulating a dispute between the

2

employer and the employee, on the one hand, or if it is

3

establishing substantive minimum standards.
Perhaps I can give you an example that would

4
5

clear this up.
QUESTION:

6

I'm really confused.

I had thought

7

you were making an exclusive jurisdiction claim, that you

8

apply the State law but it's to be applied by the board

9

through the arbitration.

10

the State law is preempted.
MR. HIPP:

11
12

Now you're telling me no, that
That's a quite different --

Well, Your Honor, let's make this

clear, because it is --

13

QUESTION:

Maybe you can make your example

14

specific to this case, and this would be my question:

15

suppose the board finds that Norris was indeed improperly

16

discharged.

17

give?

18

whistleblower's statute in the remedy that the board could

19

give?

Would there be any room for the State

MR. HIPP:

20
21

At that point, what remedy could the board

The board would be free to fashion a

remedy to deal with the finding that it made.
QUESTION:

22

The finding is that a discharge was

improper.

do, detecting a condition that might make flights unsafe

1

did.

Indeed, the board concludes,

2

disciplined, he should have gotten a medal.

3

the remedy is -- and what could the remedy be, and how

4

would it differ from a State law remedy under the

5

whistleblower act?
MR. HIPP:

6

instead of being
Therefore,

The remedy would be left open to the

7

adjustment board to establish, and that remedy would take

8

into account the State public policies in establishing

9

whatever remedy the adjustment board wanted.
QUESTION:

10

But as a practical matter, could

11

the -- in the absence of a State law, couldn't the board

12

do exactly the same thing?

13

State law for the source of its public policy, but it

14

could come up with basically the same standard, couldn't

15

it?

16
17
18

MR. HIPP:

It would simply not look to

That's exactly correct, Your Honor,

and in fact that is a -QUESTION:

Why, then, did Congress add -- if I'm

19

correct, why did Congress add a whistleblower provision to

20

the substantive law governing rail employees but not

21

airline employees?

22

MR. HIPP:

Well, it was only addressing the

railroad side of the equation in the -QUESTION:

redundant, equally unnecessary with respect to the rail

employees?
MR. HIPP:

2

Yes, Your Honor, except for one

3

thing.

4

a specific punitive damage remedy is included under that

5

of $20,000.

6

What is clear under the Federal Rail Safety Act is

Therefore, there is a direction by Congress as

7

to how you should be formulating your remedy, and it's

8

important that you understand, particularly in dealing

9

with the arguments by my opponents here, that under the

10

Federal Rail Safety Act, nonunion employees are committed

11

to adjustment board jurisdiction.

12

So that even in the absence of a collective

13

bargaining agreement, those employees go through the

14

adjustment board procedure for resolution of their claim,

15

and this is why I need to address, if you don't mind,

16

Justice Scalia's point, because I think it's a fundamental

17

point here, and that is, what is the source of the law,

18

the substantive law that an adjustment board looks at?

19

What did Congress intend about that, because it deals with

20

the complex questions, including the Seventh Amendment

21

question that is presented here.

22

If all Congress had said was, you take State law

23

claims, and you move them over to an adjustment board

24

process, then you would have a problem with regard to a

25

right to jury trial, but that is not what Congress said.

Congress said, we want disputes, grievances, if you will,

2

which are identified to include discharges, to be resolved

3

by an adjustment board, and the adjustment board -- and

this Court recognized this in Burley, by the way, and I

will refer to footnote 36 of Burley, for exactly the

problem that you presented, Justice Scalia, and that is -QUESTION:

What does he have to grieve about?

State law does not apply.

There is a State whistleblower

The employee is dismissed, claims it's in

You're telling me

Okay, in that particular grievance he

17

has been disciplined in some way, as you've just

18

described.

QUESTION:

Yes, and he says, this disciplining

is in violation of State law, isn't he saying?

MR. HIPP:

Correct, and now --

QUESTION:

If it's not in violation of State

23

law, it's okay.
MR. HIPP:

So now the question is that there's a

dispute between the employee and the employer.

you tell me State law doesn't govern, there's no dispute.

exactly -- this is my point, and that is, the adjustment

board was established by Congress, and you'll see this in

3

Representative Crosser's statements at the time of the

passage of the act:

kinds of judgments based upon a range of policy

considerations.

Well, and I take it from what you've

just said that among those policy considerations is not

the State law.

MR. HIPP:

The State law may be taken into

Is it just totally arbitrary, then,

account.

on the part of the adjustment board?

14

it could do lots of different things, but it doesn't have

15

to do any?

It may, it may not,

16

MR. HIPP:

It is not arbitrary, Your Honor.

be, but it doesn't have to.

in violation of Federal or State safety laws, to provide a

3

floor at whatever the State safety law mandated, but it

4

would be up to -- and there could be inconsistencies.
Let's give you an example.

This was one of the

things Congress addressed when it was looking at the right

to work laws.

then you have another State law that says, no, you have a

What if you have a State law that said, you

10

right to work here, and you cannot require somebody to

11

become a union member.

There's a conflict there.

Well, Congress dealt with that in an explicit

12

13

fashion by saying we're not going to apply these

14

particular kinds of laws across State lines, but when you

15

look, and in particular you look at Burley, when it talks

16

about what the nature of the substantive considerations

17

are at the adjustment board level, here's what they say in

agreement or otherwise, and other factors, that that will

determine how the adjustment board comes out.

MR. HIPP:

Hawaii has a statute and Nevada doesn't.

MR. HIPP:

That's correct.

8

QUESTION:

So then, the State law must be

virtually nonexistent.
MR. HIPP:

10

It must be entirely preemptive.

Well, in the context of a dispute

11

between an employer and an employee, that is absolutely

12

correct.

QUESTION:

Then you're withdrawing what you said

earlier about -- you said State law provides a floor,

I believe the Chief Justice

asked me if those cases would come out the same.

believe that the cases would come out the same, and

MR. HIPP:

The source comes from four different

Because in one you have provided a

there would be a conflict.

That is correct, Your Honor.

1

That just doesn't make any sense.

Congress passes a law saying, here's a -- we want this law

3

to apply to railroads, and the board says well, we'll

4

apply it not only to railroads, we'll apply it to

5

MR. HIPP:

6

My response is that the policies

7

would carry over because Congress, in the legislative

history which we cited for you, states very specifically

9

that it understands that this same protection is provided

10

through the adjustment board process.
QUESTION:

to an earlier question by identifying four sources of law.

QUESTION:

how does that reconcile the Chief Justice's hypothetical,

if the two States have different policies?

As long as they don't have

decides upon, it would take into account the policies

involved and establish a floor for the employees.

This, of course, is nothing new.

I would like to make two final points here, and

Aren't you doing away with it too,

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

5

Petitioners have lost sight of what the RLA is.

The RLA provides for airlines and railroads to enter into

agreements, and provides procedures for enforcing those

agreements.

Nothing in the RLA sets terms and conditions of

setting those terms and conditions of employment by

providing minimum protections for all workers, including

workers covered by the RLA.

into an RLA forum these minimum protections.

Well, if you were to prevail in this

cutback -- if Your Honor is referring to construction of

the omitted case language --

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. MOLLWAY:

9

Yes.
Insofar as the omitted case

language might have been earlier construed to include

10

independent claims, I believe that cutback has already

11

come.

12

specifically involved a personal injury brought under the

13

FELA.

14

I believe it came in Buell in 1987.

That case

Personal injuries were the only specific example

15

of omitted case in the Burley decision, and to the extent

16

that that decision was referring to a personal injury

17

covered by the FELA, I believe that omitted case did come,

18

has now been either eliminated or at least rejected

19

insofar as it might earlier have been interpreted in that

20

way.

21

A lot of the problem here I believe has been

recognized by the panel in that petitioners are unclear as

23

to what they are really asking for.

24

25

minimum protections disappear totally -- or are they

asking for forum preemption?

2

independent claims are funneled into the RLA forum.

3

That is, that these kinds of

They say, in their briefs, that they are arguing

4

for forum preemption, but they shift continually back and

5

forth, as in fact has just occurred in the oral argument,

6

and even in their briefs, in their reply brief in

7

footnote 5, they refer to what is in essence substantive

8

preemption, wiping out these rights.

9

Obviously, the analysis that will be applied to

10

petitioner's case will differ depending on which kind of

11

preemption they are seeking, but in either case, we

12

submit, preemption is inappropriate, and that is because

13

these independent laws were never intended by Congress to

14

be wiped out either in terms of --

15

QUESTION:

-- something else between the two,

16

for exclusive jurisdiction but applying both State and

17

Federal law and substantive preemption -- that is, to the

18

extent that there would be questions and comments in a

19

wrongful discharge before the board, that the question

20

whether Norris was wrongfully discharged has to be

21

determined by the board, and then the State forum can take

22

over, so it's kind of a deference until the board decides

23

the preliminary question.

24

a way of harmonizing State and Federal law?

1

Federal law only refers to contract disputes, and in the

2

case of Mr. Norris' common law dispute, that is not based

3

on the contract.

4

We are looking at the distinction as being the

5

source of the right that Mr. Norris is pursuing, so

6

insofar as Mr. Norris is pursuing a right independent of

7

the collective bargaining agreement, even if there were

8

some question that were to arise under a contract because

9

the source of the right is independent of the contract,

10

that particular right remains adjudicable in a court and

11

need not go through the RLA procedure.

12

QUESTION:

Well if a State is willing to take

13

the trouble to do it, can a State enact, therefore, an

14

extremely detailed code of labor management relations

15

basically covering everything that is normally covered in

16

CBA's and therefore, in each case, simply be enforcing a

17

substantive State -- the employee who might sue under it

18

would in each case simply be enforcing a substantive State

19

law right and therefore ignore the CBA entirely?

20

MS. MOLLWAY:

Well, the State obviously could

21

not come into conflict with direct Federal law, but the

agreements and one that is entirely in harmony, can it

therefore, in effect, provide on each really serious issue

3

an alternate forum if it has a sufficiently detailed law

4

to address each issue?

5

MS. MOLLWAY:

I believe, Your Honor, that it

6

could, but it would at that point have to also refer to

7

the collective bargaining agreement if there was one that

8

applied to that particular provision.

9

QUESTION:

10

Well, for example, if there were a

seniority provision in the collective bargaining

1

Mining and similar precedent the normal rules of

administrative res judicata would apply.
The second point I would like to make is related

3

“■

4

to that, which is, we believe that what an arbitrator, or

5

what the National Railroad Adjustment Board can decide

6

under the RLA are grievances, and we believe that the term

7

grievances, by and large, includes claims based on the

8

collective bargaining agreement.

9

Now, to the extent the collective bargaining

10

agreement actually incorporates State law, then it may

11

well be that the arbitrator can look to State law, but his

12

or her authority to do so is solely bounded by the terms

13

of the contract, and that is because, again, the term

14

grievances really embraces claims based on the employment

1

contract.
16

The third point I would like to make has to do

17

with the hypothetical that arose with respect to whether a

18

State could effectively enact a comprehensive labor code

19

that would address virtually all of the subjects that

20

would be covered under a collective bargaining agreement.

21

We think the answer to that to a large extent

22

depends on whether the State was attempting to regulate

23

the collective bargaining process on the one hand, in

24

which case we think that it would severely limited by

25

doing so, because that is what the RLA deals with.

process for arriving at an agreement rather than the

QUESTION:

10

MR. SEAMON:

11

QUESTION:

Why just safety?

Why not wages?

It can cover wages as well.
Well, all terms of employment.

You're saying that States can control the mandatory terms

13

of an employment agreement under the RLA.
MR. SEAMON:

There may be other Federal statutes

w

14

^

15

and Supremacy Clause problems at the margins, but as far

16

as the RLA is concerned, the answer is yes, substantive

17

matters such as wages.

18

The next point is also related to the question

19

about what a State can regulate without running afoul of

20

the RLA and the process for arbitrating minor grievances,

21

and that is that our opponents try to make a distinction

22

between disputes that arise in the employment setting and

23

safety issues, but in fact the two are often related.

determined that there were a minimal number of cabooses

that had to be added to trains even though the collective

try to draw between safety matters on the one hand and

employment disputes on the other hand doesn't really

exist.

In that case, the State had

And the last point I'd like to make with respect

to issues that arose prior in the argument has to do with

16

don't know the answer to the question of whether the

17

Seventh Amendment applies.

18

20

that even if a person doesn't have a constitutional right

to a jury trial in a State court, it's nonetheless an

16

important and valuable right, and so in interpreting the

obligation to do so, although we would certainly think

that in certain cases it would be prudent, and that the

Does the State have any

Could the State court be bound by

factual findings in the arbitration?

MR. SEAMON:

QUESTION:

Yes.
And would the arbitration panel be

bound by factual findings in the State proceeding if that

terminated first?
MR. SEAMON:

I believe that's so, and there --

18

and that is where the problem of deferral becomes

19

important, and we think that -- but we don't believe that

20

the RLA itself, of its own force, would require a State

21

court to basically defer or stay proceedings pending the

22

outcome of arbitration, at least as long as the

23

plaintiff's claim does not depend on an interpretation of

24

the collective bargaining agreement.

Either the claim can be brought in State court, and we

think that respondent's claim here can be brought in State

court because it doesn't depend on an interpretation of

the collective bargaining agreement, or it has to be

MR. SEAMON:

Well, in this case that issue

doesn't arise because the respondent was very clearly

discharged after the step 1 hearing, but in general the

question of whether a discharge occurs under -- for Hawaii

law.

If it's independent -QUESTION:

So that would mean that if an

arbitrator determined there was a discharge within the

meaning of the collective bargaining agreement, that would

not necessarily preclude a different holding in the State
