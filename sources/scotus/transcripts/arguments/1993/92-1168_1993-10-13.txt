Mr. Venick, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRWIN VENICK

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. VENICK:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case calls upon this Court to determine

10
11

whether psychological injury is a necessary requirement

12

for a finding of hostile environment liability under title

13

VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

14

The district court found that Teresa Harris was

15

subjected to a continuing pattern of sex-based derogatory

16

conduct that was not imposed upon men by the president of

17

Forklift.

18

offensive to Mrs. Harris, and would have offended a

19

reasonable person in her position.

20

were dismissed in the trial court and summarily affirmed

21

on appeal based upon the Sixth Circuit rule requiring

22

psychological injury.

23

The conduct was found to be unwelcome,

Ms. Harris' claims

In Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, this Court

24

stated that a hostile work environment exists if conduct

25

is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the

conditions of employment and create an abusive working

2

environment.

3

was limited to tangible or economic discrimination, and

4

further observed that title VII affords employees the

5

right to work free from sex-based discriminatory insult

6

and ridicule.

7

This Court rejected the view that title VII

The psychological injury test should be rejected

8

because it conditions liability in a title VII case upon

9

the reaction of the victim of discriminatory conduct in

10

the workplace, rather than the effect of that conduct on

11

the terms and conditions of employment.

12

not further the equal employment opportunity goals of

13

title VII.

14

It therefore does

Because the district court's findings satisfy

15

the Meritor standard, Ms. Harris requests reversal of the

16

judgment below.

17

19

QUESTION:

Do you take the position that there

should be no requirement of proof of subjective effect?
MR. VENICK:

Your Honor, it's our position that

20

there is a subjective element in the unwelcomeness

21

requirement.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. VENICK:

Yes.
But beyond that, in this particular

24

case, Your Honor, there were findings that there was both

25

subjective harm, and that Ms. Harris was also subjected to

1

conduct that would have offended a reasonable person in

2

her position, so that's not a question that this Court

3

needs to reach in this case.
But with respect to clarifying the Meritor

4
5

decision, it's our position that the Meritor test should

6

be clarified to the extent that existing societal

7

stereotypes should not be the standard against which

8

hostile environment claims are evaluated.

9

In my argument, I will first turn to the

10

specific conduct that was found by the district court.

11

will then discuss why the psychological injury test should

12

not be required for a finding of a hostile work

13

environment, and finally, I will argue that Forklift's

14

test neither concedes the psychological injury

15

requirement, nor comports with the test announced by this

16

Court in Meritor.

17

I

The magistrate below found that Charles Hardy

18

was a crude and vulgar man who demeans female employees in

19

his workplace.

20

questioned the competence of Teresa Harris because she was

21

a woman.

22

Through his conduct, Charles Hardy

He made statements to her in the midst of

23

meetings of her fellow employees,

25

Mr. Venick --

MR. VENICK:

6

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor?
-- with respect to those comments

7

that you just quoted, does the sexual harassment caption

8

really fit those?

9

not quite right, to describe the comments that you just

10
11

That has a connotation that perhaps is

referred to.
MR. VENICK:

Your Honor, those comments may be

12

characterized more properly as sex-based comments, but

13

still we believe fall within the sexual harassment --

14

QUESTION:

Hasn't the EEOC picked up on the word

15

gender to try to distinguish that kind of comment from the

16

sexual harassment?

17

MR. VENICK:

They have, Your Honor, and in

18

addition, in their 1990 guidelines, the EEOC sets forth a

19

separate category which it characterizes as sex-based

20

comments, but does not remove them from its general rules

21

regarding the analysis of a sexual harassment case.

22

Mr. Hardy also directed --

Mr. Venick, suppose I'm a male

MR. VENICK:

Now, if there

their employment because of their sex.

15

conduct that Mr. Hardy conducted and which was found by

16

the trial court in our view exposed Teresa Harris to

17

conduct that discriminated against her because of her sex.

18

All these comments, all this conduct, was directed only at

19

women, only at Teresa Harris, not at men, and therefore we

20

believe it falls squarely within title VII.

21

QUESTION:

In this case, the

So it would be different if Charles

22

Hardy had been equally scathing and offensive to men,

23

calling them dumb-ass men?

MR. VENICK:

I believe in that case, Your Honor,

He wouldn't discriminate on the basis

MR. VENICK:

That's right, because he's not

discriminating on the basis of sex.

Some of these are hard to transpose

in that way.

11

MR. VENICK:

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. VENICK:

That's correct, Your Honor.

But again, Your Honor, if Mr. Hardy

14

perhaps directed all these comments towards men, then the

15

males at the workplace may have had a claim, and not

16

Teresa Harris.

But Mr. -- in getting back to your question --

3

MR. VENICK:

Going back to your comment, Justice

4

Ginsburg, there were comments and conduct directed by

5

Mr. Hardy that had a sexual connotation.

only female employees to remove coins from his front pants

pocket.

8

coins on the floor and then make comments about their

9

physical attributes.

He would only ask female employees to pick up

QUESTION:

He would ask

Just before we leave this point,

11

suppose there are sex-based comments in the workplace

12

generally among men.

They talk about sex all the time.
They talk about male sex,

It's not directed at

What result?
MR. VENICK:

Your Honor, I don't believe in that

18

case that specific factual situation would fall within the

19

sex-based criterion under Meritor.

20

discrimination on the basis of sex, we have comments or

21

conduct and discussions that involve sex.

QUESTION:

We don't have

Well, you certainly could have a

hostile working environment that makes it very difficult

24

for the female employee to continue to work there,

couldn't you, under those circumstances?

MR. VENICK:

directed towards the female employee - QUESTION:

4

If the conduct, Your Honor, is

No, that wasn't the assumption, but

it nonetheless creates a hostile working environment.

5

MR. VENICK:

If the conduct is found under

6

Meritor to be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter

7

the conditions of that employee's work environment, yes,

8

that would be a hostile work environment.
QUESTION:

What is the reasonable person

10

standard that we employ?

11

reasonable victim, or what is it?

12

in the views of different courts about what the reasonable

13

person standard is, isn't there?

14

MR. VENICK:

Is it a reasonable woman, or a
There's some difference

Well, Justice O'Connor, there is a

15

great deal of confusion in the lower courts about that

16

standard.

17

perhaps don't need to get to that point in this case, but

18

in our brief we've characterized it as a reasonable person

1

in the position of the plaintiff, recognizing that hostile

20

environment claims can be brought by both men or women.

21

In our brief -- again, we don't really --

It is our view, though, that if the Court

22

decides to address that question and wants to fashion a

23

test, that what the Court needs to bear in mind is, what

24

is the goal that we're trying to achieve, and I think that

25

goal can be perceived in two ways.

1

First, it is essential that existing societal

2

stereotypes be eliminated from consideration of workplace

3

conduct, and secondly, we have to look towards the goals

4

and objectives of title VII, which is to eliminate

5

discrimination in the workplace, and I think if the Court

6

is the address that point, I would suggest that it look at

7

it from those two principles.

8

QUESTION:

9
10
11

Well, I don't see why it should

necessarily be the reasonable woman, reasonable victim, as
you put it, rather than the reasonable employer.
MR. VENICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, the reasonable

12

employer is the person who is perpetrating the conduct.

13

In our view - -

14

QUESTION:

Well, that's what we're trying to

15

find out, and one way we will find out differently,

16

depending on what test is applied, is whether you say, is

17

it a reasonable employer or a reasonable victim?

18

MR. VENICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, title VII is

19

intended by its very language to protect employees from

20

discriminatory conduct in the workplace.

21

therefore be our view that - -

QUESTION:

23
24
25

It would

It doesn't define from whose focus

discrimination is to be considered.
MR. VENICK:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice,

but the focus of the statute is to protect employees, and

1

it would therefore seem in our view that the perspective

2

should be from the perspective of the plaintiff or the

3

victim.

4

QUESTION:

Well, you have any number of personal

5

injury statutes -- that are designed to protect employees,

6

but the standard of negligence is not the standard of a

7

reasonable employee but the standard of a reasonable

8

person.
MR. VENICK:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice,

10

and a number of the amici that have filed briefs have

11

pointed out one of the problems with the reasonableness

12

standard, and that is that it's not found expressly in the

13

language of title VII.

14

Court's attention to its language in Meritor that -- to

15

the effect that a mere insult would not give rise to title

16

VII liability, and in our view some of the lower courts

17

have imported and implied a reasonableness standard to

18

take into consideration that limiting factor that this

1

Court announced in Meritor.

20

QUESTION:

However, I would direct the

Of course, I have trouble with this

21

whole debate.

It's hard for me to imagine something that

22

a reasonable employer could do that a reasonable employee

23

could object to.

24

to me that if the reasonable employee could object to it,

25

a reasonable employer couldn't do it.

It just seems to me circular.

It seems

the case.
I have great difficulty with this problem, and I

2

3

agree with the suggestion of the Chief Justice that we

4

look upon the actor whom we are attempting to control, and

5

require that that actor be reasonable in his or her

6

conduct in the workplace.
MR. VENICK:

7

Your Honor, that would create a

8

problem in the context of this case, because Mr. Hardy

9

believed that he was acting reasonably.

10

his conduct was - QUESTION:

11
12

Well, but he might have been very

wrong.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. VENICK:

15

He believed that

We would hope he might be found to

have been very wrong, but -QUESTION:

16

And it's not his subjective belief,

17

is it?

If an employer thinks he's being reasonable and

18

he's coarse and vulgar and creates a hostile working

19

environment, he's liable under the law.
MR. VENICK:

20

That's correct,

if his conduct is

21

found to be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the

22

working environment, and it's our view that that

23

perspective needs to be from the perspective of the

24

employee, because it's the employee who's subjected to the

25

conduct.

The employer is the one who is causing the

1

conduct, and it's the employee who is the one who is going

2

to be complaining about it.

3

It's our view that any test --

4

QUESTION:

You're positing a reasonable employer

5

who has been educated and made aware, not -- for example,

6

a reasonable employer in the old days might have thought

7

it was perfectly fine to say all kinds of unpleasant

8

things to women.

9

Ladies Day, and in their day they were considered entirely

Even great professors had such things as

10

reasonable, so we're positing a reasonable employer who

11

knows the law, knows the command, thou shalt not

12

discriminate.

13

MR. VENICK:

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg,

14

but even in the situation where all employers are presumed

15

to know the law, as Charles Hardy was presumed to know the

16

law, they ofttimes, or sometimes don't act in accordance

17

with the law, and that's why, from our perspective, it's

18

the employee who has the interest in bringing forth

19

actions under title VII to enforce the law, and that's why

20

from our view that is the employee's perspective, if the

21

Court's going to reach that point, that should be utilized

22

in analyzing these facts.

23

It's our view that any test that requires

24

psychological injury as a necessary element of proof to

25

establish a sexually hostile work environment does not

1

further the objectives of title VII to eliminate

2

discriminatory conduct because of an employee's sex.

3

The psychological injury test requires such an

4

employer - - or employee to endure discriminatory conduct

5

without a remedy, and that results for two reasons:

6

first, because employment conditions can be altered by

7

severe or pervasive workplace conduct before any kind of

8

psychological injury manifests itself, and secondly
because the psychological injury threshold itself may

10

insulate unlawful activity if employees leave their

11

employment rather than suffer continued workplace

12

harassment because of their sex.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Venick, you were going to tell us

14

why the respondent, although purporting to concede the

15

psychological injury point, in fact does not concede it.

16

I hope you'll do that before your --

17

MR. VENICK:

18

Forklift suggests a test in its brief, that the

I'll do that right now, Your Honor.

1

test that satisfies Meritor, the only test that satisfies

20

Meritor, is that the plaintiff must show interference with

21

his or her work performance, and that test can only be

22

satisfied in one of two ways:

23

injury, or an inability to do the job.

2

for us to concede how, or conceive of how a worker may be

unable to do their job without manifesting some degree of

psychological injury.

saying one and the same thing, and therefore, in our view,

they basically back-door the psychological injury

requirement and put it in new garb.
QUESTION:

9

It is hard

It seems to be a circular argument

How do you define interfere with work

performance?
MR. VENICK:

10

Your Honor, we don't believe that

11

that test is necessary for a finding of hostile work

12

environment.

13

Meritor set forth a proper standard, and that is that the

14

conduct should be evaluated to determine whether it is

15

sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions

16

of the workplace, and that can involve a whole range of

17

effects, and to try to categorize them --

It's our belief that this Court under

QUESTION:

How about just saying it makes the

job more difficult for the person?
MR. VENICK:

20

Again, we would need to, in that

21

case, Your Honor, try to quantify what that difficulty is,

22

and we harken back to the language in Meritor that

MR. MINEAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court held in Meritor Savings Bank v.

Vinson that sexual harassment can result in title VII

23

discrimination if the conduct is gender-based, unwelcome,

24

and sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the

25

conditions of the victim's employment.

1

There's no question in this case the conduct at

2

issue was gender-based and unwelcome.

3

question is whether it was sufficiently severe or

4

pervasive to satisfy the Vinson test.

5

plaintiff can satisfy that requirement by showing that the

6

gender-based conduct made it more difficult for the person

to do the job.

QUESTION:

Do you have both an objective and a

subjective component to "make more difficult"?
MR. MINEAR:

For that standard, Your Honor, we

have only an objective component.

The question is whether

Why isn't that predicating liability

No.

just like negligence in the act.
MR. MINEAR:

Yes, that is correct, and -- but

9

the issue in this case is the question of severity or

10

pervasiveness, trying to understand what that concept

11

means in the workplace.

12

QUESTION:

And the remedy could be simply, stop

it, without any -- talking about somebody who says the job

is more difficult for me to perform than the next guy --

not asking for any money, and just says, the remedy is an

injunctive order to stop it.

MR. MINEAR:

That is exactly correct.

Now, this

is not the only way to prove that conduct might be severe

20

in a case like this, because it helps to focus the inquiry

We

2

look to what a reasonable person in her situation, whether

3

or not that person is disadvantaged, vis-a-vis people who

4

are not subject to that treatment.
Now, if the conduct is gender-based, and is

5
6

unwelcome, then we move on to that question of whether it

7

makes it more difficult for a reasonable person in her

situation to do the job.

9

QUESTION:

Even if it's only mildly offensive,

10

so it's not severe enough -- it's just mildly offensive,

11

but it's offensive.
MR. MINEAR:

12

Well, that's captured by our notion

13

of a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff.

14

Now, we accept that in the workplace there's a

15

certain amount of unpleasantness in any workplace, and

16

that people become accustomed to that one way or another.

17

We're expected as a matter -- society expects us to accept

So if that's the law of the Sixth

QUESTION:

Where do you find a clear statement

that there's an alternative ruling in this case?
MR. CHERNAU:

I don't believe that he used the

18

word, alternative, but in reading at A-34 and A-35,

19

particularly I think at A-35, where he says, "Although

20

Hardy may at times have genuinely offended plaintiff, I do

21

not believe that he created a working environment so

22

poisoned as to be intimidating or abusive to plaintiff,"

23

and I believe that he was trying to apply the exact

24

language out of Meritor, so I think that he applied

Rabidue, and then went beyond Rabidue.

Now, if -- if we agree that psychological injury

should not have to be proven, I again state to you that I

believe that in this case the magistrate applied every

test that he could have applied, including what the EEOC

says to apply, which is interfere with a reasonable

person's work performance or victim's performance, the

Meritor, which I just recited that he said, and that the

psychological injury doesn't tie in and that his thought

thought process was infected by the Rabidue case, and I

say that it wasn't.

If he regards it as a close case,

of certiorari, he says,

"Although Hardy may at times have

under Meritor, that is the conjunctive part where Meritor

The confines of that paragraph, I

I do think, if I could quickly make this point,

that the proper test is the reasonable person test,

because what we're looking at under this law is the effect

I don't think that we're looking into the
