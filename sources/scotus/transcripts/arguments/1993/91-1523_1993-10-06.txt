CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Ayer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. AYER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. AYER:

Thank

you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief

Justice and may it please the Court:

10

In the Burlington decision, this Court

11

recognized that one of the judicial remedies available for

12

a school district's failure to provide an education

13

meeting the requirements of the Individuals with

14

Disabilities Education Act is reimbursement of the child's

15

parents for the cost of removing their child from the

16

public school and putting he or she into a private school

17

that provides an education that is proper under the act.

18

The Court in Burlington explained that

19

conclusion in part on the ground that where parents select

20

a private school placement that is found to be "proper

21

under the act" the award of such reimbursement does

22

nothing more than pay the parents the cost that should

23

have been paid initially by the public school for the

24

placement that should have been provided in the first

25

place.

the court below.held, this right to reimbursement under

3

Burlington arises wherever the private placement selected

4

by the parents ultimately proves to be beneficial to the

5

child, or rather, whether such placements are constrained,

6

as are all other placements under the Individuals with

7

Disabilities Education Act by the obligation to provide a

8

free appropriate public education, which is defined

9

precisely and specifically in the act.

10
11

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Ayers, the -- it's defined,

I guess, in section 1401?

12

MR. AYER:

1401(a)(18), Your Honor.

13

QUESTION:

Do you think that that provision is

The issue presented in this case is whether, as

applicable at all to private placements?

MR. AYER:

Well, Your Honor --

16

QUESTION:

-- cover, really, State placements --

17

MR. AYER:

I think the place --

18

QUESTION:

-- or State provision of --

19

MR. AYER:

The place to begin in thinking about

20

it is with the initial section of the act, which states

21

the purpose of the act, and it states that purpose very

22

explicitly in terms of assuring that all children with

23

disabilities will have available to them a free,

24

appropriate public education.

25

That is the overriding, the primary purpose.

)

The Court recognized that in Burlington.
QUESTION:

2

Well, okay.

I recognize that, and

3

I'd like you to tell us, if you will, where in the statute

4

specifically it covers private placement, or whether this

5

is just something by way of a remedy that the courts have

6

developed under the act.
MR. AYER:

7

Well, the statute does not explicitly

8

provide for the Burlington remedy, either, and so the fact

9

that there is a remedy there is something that is

10

recognized as necessary to accomplish the purposes of the

11

act, so I can't point to something specifically that

12

limits a remedy that is not explicitly dealt with in the

13

statute.

What I think I can do --

14

QUESTION:

-- than that.

If you insist upon

£
15

free, appropriate public education, there's no private

16

placement.

17

MR. AYER:

Well, I would disagree with that.

18

QUESTION:

The only thing you can do is to send

19

the person to a public school. Wouldn't that have to be

20

your position?

21

MR. AYER:

Well, the public aspect I think has

22

two parts within the definition, one is that it be a

23

public expense, and that is certainly possible, and the

24

other -- well, there's three, I guess.

25

it -- one other is that it meets State standards.

The other is that

That's

1

at dispute in this case.

2

under public supervision.

3

QUESTION:

And then the third is that it be

Well, you're willing to acknowledge

4

that it doesn't have to be under public supervision, that

5

that's not --

6

MR. AYER:

Well, I --

7

QUESTION:

-- what free appropriate -- what an

8

9

appropriate public education means, right?
MR. AYER:

Justice Scalia, I think it depends

10

how you define public supervision.

11

plainly contemplates and placements go forward I think on

12

a regular basis in private schools where the public school

13

authorities nonetheless are involved in that process.

14

They're involved in helping to prepare an individual

15

education program, and that I think fairly satisfies the

16

requirement of public supervision.

17

QUESTION:

I think the act

Mr. Ayer, you made, I think, a very

18

helpful and candid concession in your reply brief in which

19

you say there are situations that would be an exception to

20

this strict Burlington requirement that it must be a place

21

that is approved by the district, and I'd like to call

22

your attention to page 9 of your reply brief where you

23

said, in the second full paragraph, that the Court should

24

not allow FAPE's educational standards and IEP requirement

25

to foreclose unreasonably the pursuit of educational

1

opportunity through the unilateral parent placement

2

process recognized in Burlington.

3

So you seem in that passage to be recognizing

4

that there are cases where there can be deviations from

5

both the IEP requirement, the FAPE educational standards,

6

so doesn't this controversy, then, boil down to whether

7

this case fits that description?

8

MR. AYER:

Correct, Your Honor.

9

QUESTION:

And in this case there was no list

10

supplied by the public school authorities as there was in

11

Burlington, so why isn't that enough to make it

12

exceptional?

13

MR. AYER:

Well --

14

QUESTION:

Why shouldn't there be a burden on

15

the public system to say to the parents, here is a list of

16

approved private facilities?

17

MR. AYER:

Your Honor, there's certainly nothing

18

in the statute that dictates in what manner the public

19

school authorities are required to be cooperative with the

20

parents.

21

some States they do.

22

likelihood, it's going to be necessary for the parents to

23

go to somebody and ask for it.

24
25

It might be that they have a list prepared.

In

If they have such a list, in all

If there is no list, it is in the same way
necessary for the parents to go to someone, perhaps, and

1

ask the question, here's what I'd like to do under my

2

Burlington rights, I want to put the child in a private

3

school, can you tell me whether this facility meets

4

standards?
We would have a different case here if what had

6

happened was the parents had done that and been given

7

either no answer, or been given an answer which is, we

8

won't cooperate with you, we won't help you.

9

be a case where you could say that the realization of the

That might

10

free appropriate public education simply couldn't

11

realistically be accomplished here even though the parents

12

tried to do it.

13

The fundamental --

14

QUESTION:

So it comes down to who has the

15

burden of inquiry, or it's a question of whether the

16

public authority has to supply either a list or a

17

procedure, and you say no, the parent has to ask, and if

18

the parent doesn't ask, then there is effectively no

19

recourse for the parent even though the very first step in

20

this case is a given -- that is, the public authority has

21

not been able to provide the education that the statute

22

requires.

23

MR. AYER:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'd like to

24

take a couple of steps back, because I think you only get

25

to the issue that you are raising, which is whether or not

1

it is essentially not possible to accomplish, not possible

2

for the parents and the private school to accomplish the

3

objective of the statute.

4

You only get to that point after you impose an

5

initial requirement, presumptively at least, that a free

6

appropriate public education is an objective to which the

7

parents must make some efforts to achieve, and I want to

8

just talk briefly to this question of how the statute

9

operates, and the fact, first of all, what I mentioned

10

earlier, that this is a statute that, perhaps unusually,

11

has as its stated primary purpose not the elevation of

12

educational quality for disabled students, not some

13

general objective like that, the primary purpose of this

14

statute, as it states in its own language, is the

15

assurance that all children with disabilities will have

16

available a free, appropriate public education.

17

is --

18

QUESTION:

What

May I just interrupt you there?

19

Isn't the point that the statute or the conditions that

20

we're concerned with here are all conditions which are

21

intended to be for the benefit of the students.

22

make sure that the kids with disabilities do not get stuck

23

down in some -- some second-rate status, and if the

24

purpose of the various conditions that are in question

25

here are for the benefit of the students, then under

It's to

Burlington, isn't it at least possible for the students,
or the parents of the students, to waive those or to, you
might say, ignore them so that that waiver or ignoring of
them would not be a per se disqualification to
reimbursement.
MR. AYER:

Well, I have not heard -- I have not

seen or heard of that notion in the cases, Justice Souter.
It is the case, I think, that parents can take their child
out of the public system and pay for a private school
education on their own.
QUESTION:

Let me -- if I may interrupt you, do

you claim that either of the conditions in question here
are that the requirement of IEP, or the requirement of
teacher certification, is for the benefit of anyone other
than the students?
MR. AYER:
the students.

No.

I think it is for the benefit of

It is --

QUESTION:

So that if, then, the students or

their parents say well, we'll waive those so long as we
can get, in fact, an adequate education elsewhere, why
shouldn't they be allowed to waive them and why should
their waiver be a bar to reimbursement?
MR. AYER:

Well, I think this goes directly to

the question of whether State educational authorities were
intended under the act to be. left in the primary role with
10

1

2

regard to the making of educational policy.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

Exactly, or to put it

3

differently, whether the IEP and the FAPE requirements

4

were put tnere out of mistrust of the parents, or out of

5

mistrust of school authorities.

6

put there to make sure that the school authorities did not

7

give the disabled child second-rate treatment.

8

think Congress was worried about the parents giving their

9

disabled child second-rate treatment, putting him in a

10
11

It seems to me they were

You really

private placement that would be no good for him?
MR. AYER:

Your Honor, I think that what

12

Congress intended to do was to create a mechanism that

13

relied on essentially three different factors to assure

14

the quality of education, and I don't think that they

15

assumed that; parents were in many -- in most instances the

16

best judges of what would be a quality education.

17

QUESTION:

Ah, the best judge is going to be the

18

judge in a contested case for reimbursement afterwards, or

19

if not the best judge, an adequate judge.

20

scheme that the other side is claiming does not leave them

21

in the unreviewable driver's seat.

22

MR. AYER:

I mean, the

Well, it -- the standard that is

23

applied, as I was saying just now, there are three

24

elements, essentially that the statute puts in place, and

25

I would submit they work like the legs of a stool to

1

elevate together the quality of education.

2

the requirement that State educational standards be met in

3

the educations provided to disabled students, and I think

4

that's very important, because what was happening before

5

was that disabled students were in many instances simply

6

being pushed aside or being given a clearly inferior

7

education, so the notion is not that we're going to tell

8

the States what policies to put in place, but that we're

9

going to require that they treat disabled students no less

10
11

One of them is

favorably than they treat nondisabled students.
The second is the IEP process, which in this

12

statute was very explicitly spelled out.

13

you read through the language of it, a general reference

14

to the notion that, and there should be some sort of

15

discussion between the parents and the school officials.

16

This is a very explicit set of requirements which Congress

17

believed was necessary in conjunction with the other

18

factors that it was putting into the statute in order to

19

accomplish the result.

20

QUESTION:

This is not, if

Are you contending that the -- that

21

what went on at this Trident School -- it wasn't an IEP,

22

but there were, what was it, goal-settings, and I think

23

more frequent reviews -- that that wasn't a reasonable

24

substitute?

25

Is the IEP so much more intense?

MR. AYER:

Well, Your Honor, I think -- I think

1

it is perfectly clear from the court of appeals decision

2

that the court of appeals did not view what went on at

3

Trident as complying with the act, because it says

4

explicitly that.

5

QUESTION:

It wasn't an IEP, but --

6

MR. AYER:

It wasn't an IEP.

7

QUESTION:

-- there was a setting of goals for

8

this student to achieve, and an evaluation whether the

9

student --of the student's progress periodically, was

10

i

there not?

11

MR. AYER:

That's correct.

12

QUESTION:

And I'm asking you, in terms of

13

quality, was it substantially less effective in measuring

14

the child's progress than the IEP?

15

MR. AYER:

Well, what is missing from that, from

16

what you've described, and I think, Your Honor, you have

17

accurately described what is in the decisions in terms of

18

what kind of process there is.

discussion of the critical part of the IEP process, which

20

is a cooperative interaction, a give-and-take between the

what the statute requires, but there happens to be no

2

alternative school around that works via an IEP, and the

parent finds the best school available, saying, you know,

the school district has failed me, has violated the

statute, I'm going to do the best I can for my kid --

MR. AYER:

Well --

QUESTION:

-- and there happens to be no private

school who is willing to go through all of the folderol of

an IEP, or they think an IEP is really not the best way to

do it?

That parent has no remedy.
MR. AYER:

No, I don't think that's necessarily

12

the case, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Mr. Ayer, did I take it that your

17

answer to the question I asked you before was that if

18

these parents had inquired, if they had only inquired,

19

tell us a school, and they got no answer, then you would

20

say, yes, then they would be entitled to reimbursement?

21

MR. AYER:

Well --

22

QUESTION:

So does the whole thing come down to

23

whether the State has to provide them with a list, or a

24

process, to find out what would be an acceptable school,

25

or whether the parents have to initiate the inquiry in the

MR. AYER:

I don't think it comes down to that,

3

Your Honor, I think the first issue must be whether the

holding of the court of appeals decision, which is that

the free appropriate public education requirement is

entirely inapplicable in the Burlington context, with the

one exception of the requirement that the education

QUESTION:

And that's what these parents did.

2

MR. AYER:

The issue here is whether the

parents, in doing so, the parents nonetheless are governed

by the requirement of the act and the primary purpose of

5

the act, which was to -- is to achieve a free appropriate

public education.

QUESTION:

Well, let's go back to the purpose

8

again, because I don't think you've answered one of the

9

questions that we keep asking, and that is, for whose

10

benefit are these conditions which collectively make up

11

the purpose?

12

Burlington was supposedly, or was treated as being -- the

13

object of the stay-put provision was being to serve the

children so that they did not get side-tracked into some

inappropriate class while the fight was going on about

Now, this Court in Rowley, in considering what

that there are other procedural and other requirements

fair reading is a fairly low level standard.

argument with respect to the stay-put provision, wouldn't
you?

Wouldn't that be essential to, for example, the

maintenance of control over public education and assuring
that the public educational authorities would see that the
kid did not get sidetracked into a second-rate classroom
while they were fighting over what to do?

be making the same argument.

Burlington consistently with the Burlington logic that

nonmalleable, and as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, I

QUESTION:

-- if the school district is in

will have an effective remedy?

12

MR. AYER:

Well, I think -- this is a case where

what occurred was that, while the review process under the

14

statute was going forward, the parents, completely on

15

thedr own and without any conversation with the school,

16

and without telling the school district authorities that

17

they were doing it before they did it, they took the --

they applied to the Trident School, they took the child

Cnee the school district has failed to meet its

to take the chance, to send the kid to any school at all.

If the school doesn't meet up to fulfill the obligation

seems to me it falls back into the lap of the parent.

MR. AYER:

Your Honor, I think that's -- I think

16

it's a bit of an oversimplification to say that they

decided not to provide the services.

there's been a finding that what they offered wasn't

QUESTION:

But in fairness, Mr. Wright, at that

10

hearing the issue between the school board and these

parents was still whether 3 hours a week is enough or not,

12

whether you need a self-contained program, or whether 3

13

hours a week would be enough.

14

assuming you have to go somewhere else and out of this

public school, what other schools wouLd you recommend.

That was not the issue at the hearing.

whether 3 hours is enough.

MR. WRIGHT:

The issue was not, well,

The issue was

Well, no, it did go beyond that.

19

The parents -- the school system's position was 3 hours

20

was enough.

21

The parents said, no.

QUESTION:

But the school district said, none of

22

these schools is any good, not because the schools are not

23

qualified, but simply because we insist that 3 hours a

24

week is enough.

25

Wasn't that their position?

You don't need a self-contained program.

-- to accept the recommendations of

11

people who already thought that 3 hours a week for this

child was enough.

13

that question was never put to them.

What other schools would you recommend?

can't daughter go down the road to District 1 and why

can't you simply pay District 1, what you --

If they concluded that the school -- none of the

after the fact on judicial review to be correct, your

That's a difficult question, as

you're perhaps aware, the Second Circuit has wrestled

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Under the broad remedial provision of this

21

statute, a judge is allowed to award any remedy that he

deems appropriate, and as this Court said in the

23

Burlington case, appropriate means appropriate in light of

24

the purpose of this statute.

)

1

answer to many of the questions that the justices have

2

posed today comes in asking the right question, and that

3

question is, what is the purpose of this statute?

4

its aim?

5

^

Why did Congress enact the IDEA?
Congress enacted IDEA to provide a basic floor

6

of educational opportunity for disabled children, to

7

ensure that those children received an education that was

8

calculated to enable them to receive benefit, and in

9

deciding what remedies are appropriate, we believe that

10

basic equitable principles dictate that the legal standard

11

should be no more onerous and no more complicated than are

12

absolutely necessary to effectuate the statutory purpose.

13

Now, with respect to the questions that Justice

14

Ginsburg have raised about whether parents have to make

15

reasonable inquiries or reasonable efforts to comply with

16

the particulars of section 1401, or whether they have to

17

choose a school from a list, the position of the United

18

States is that no such per se requirements should be

19

imposed as a rigid matter.

20

There should be no requirement as such that

21

parents make inquiries, and the reason for this, first of

22

all, is that the statute contains no such requirement.

23

There is no explicit mandate that parents make inquiries,

24

seek information, confer and consult endlessly before they

25

may challenge the IEP proposed and received a remedy.

lost to the education of that child, and it also produces

2

uncertainty, because the parents ask themselves, how much

3

of an effort is enough, how much of an official response

4

is sufficient, when can we cut our losses and move our

5

child, and all of those uncertainties get played out at

6

the remedial phase of the statute, when the judge is asked

7

to consider how much effort is enough, whether what the

8

school district did is equitably sufficient.
QUESTION:

9

Ms. Wax, we're going back now to the

10

setting in the school system and not when we're in court

11

talking about the parents' choice.

12

isn't the thrust of the act that the parents and the

13

school authority should be trying to work with each other

14

to the maximum extent possible, rather than an incentive

15

for the parents to pull that child out of the public

16

school system quickly and put it in some superior private

17

school?

18

MS. WAX:

In the school system,

Your Honor, that overstates the

19

statutory interest in having parents and school districts

20

consult and confer.

21

is fully exhausted by coming together to try and formulate

22

an IEP in the first instance.

23

Once that proposal is signed and sealed and

proposed, then under the statute parents have no open-

1

fact as this Court recognized in Burlington, to

2

incorporate such a requirement would be very much to the

3

disadvantage of parents, because the school district

4

always has the upper hand in this situation.
On the contrary, under section 1415 of the act,

5
6

the parents have an immediate right to challenge the

7

adequacy of the IEP, to challenge any aspect of the school

8

district's proposal at the administrative level, first by

9

directing the challenge to the school district itself,

10

then with appeal to the State, and finally, judicial

their proposal was adopted, it would work to the detriment

of the parents and the children.

So the point is that the requirement that

the question is, the equitable question is, do those added

That is, it accomplished the purpose

And if the education lives up to that standard,

6

then consideration of whether the school's on a list, or

whether inquiries were made, or whether certain

formalities were complied with, really becomes

superfluous.

They become beside the point, and in that

then the judge might look at things such as how well-

None of those considerations would come in in

this case, because here there was clear benefit to the

I didn't --

MR. AYER:

Well, that list would not, and you

could have another list that would.
But three points I'd like to make very quickly,

17

and one is that I must take exception to the proposition

18

that the purpose of the act is to provide an appropriate

19

education as that word is defined in Rowley.

20

of the act is to provide a FAPE, a free appropriate public

21

education, which is, I think, a good bit more than an

22

appropriate education, which is one that simply confers

23

some benefit.
