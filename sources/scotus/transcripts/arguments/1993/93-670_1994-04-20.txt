ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES SOVEL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. SOVEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

In Scindia Steam Navigation Company v. De Los

12

Santos, this Court held that a shipowner's duty of care

13

owed to longshoremen extended to unsafe conditions

14

existing at the start of cargo operations and that, as to

15

such conditions, the shipowner had a duty of inspection.

16

The Scindia decision did not specifically

17

address the issue of whether this duty applied to unsafe

18

conditions existing in a cargo stow.

19

distinction based on who may have created a particular

20

unsafe condition.

21

decision was on the shipowner's knowledge of an unsafe

22

condition, with the principle issue in Scindia being the

23

ship -- on the shipowner's duty of inspection.

24
25

Nor did it make any

Rather, the focus of the Scindia

Thus, in Scindia, this Court held that, as to
unsafe conditions existing at the start of cargo

1

operations, the shipowner had a duty of inspection and was

2

charged with knowledge of those conditions, which would

3

have been discovered by a reasonable inspection, but that

4

once cargo operations began, the shipowner had no ongoing

5

or continuing duty of inspection to discover unsafe

6

conditions which might arise within the confines of those

7

cargo operations.
In Derr v. Kawasaki Risen K.K., the Third

8

9

Circuit erroneously interpreted Scindia as relieving a

10

shipowner from any duty of inspection with respect to

11

unsafe conditions in a cargo stow, no matter when or by

12

whom that condition was created, and without regard to

13

whether a particular unsafe condition may have existed at

14

the start of cargo operations.

15
16

QUESTION:

Is a cargo stow an object or a

function?

17

MR. SOVEL:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. SOVEL:

I -Or a -- or a task or a place?
I consider it a condition of the

20

vessel.

21

It's a -- a -- it becomes part of the stow.

22

stow becomes part of the ship because it is what the ship

23

is being carried.

24
25

I consider it essentially -- it's -- it's a fact.

QUESTION:

Part of the

So, when we're talking about a cargo

stow, we're talking about a certain place on the ship,

1

plus the functions that were necessary in order to put the

2

cargo in that place?

3

MR. SOVEL:

Plus the functions and the

4

operations and how that cargo is held in place or stored

5

in place in the ship.

6

is to functions, but longshoremen would place -- take the

7

cargo from the cargo hook, move it into the stow, and

8

place it in the position -- and, presumably, in some

9

manner, that cargo would be secured in place and you'd end

I'm not clear on what the reference

10

up with a cargo stow that would be presented to the

11

discharging longshoreman.

12

factual, physical condition that exists at the time the

13

unloading longshoremen go aboard the ship.

14

QUESTION:

And that is -- then becomes a

Well, do you argue that the shipowner

15

has a duty to go into the cargo stow area after it has

16

been loaded on board to see the condition of it and to try

17

to determine if there are any hidden defects or problems?

18

MR. SOVEL:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SOVEL:

No.

As a - -

Is that your argument?
No.

As a general proposition, no.

21

Although factually there might be certain types of cargo

22

stows where that might in fact be done.

23

only that the shipowner should be held responsible for

24

that which the shipowners already do in the manner in

25

which they observe the way cargo is being stowed, the

My argument is

conditions that would be disclosed by such inspections -QUESTION:

Well, are you arguing that the

3

shipowner only has a duty of care as to conditions that

4

are open and obvious in the stow?

5

MR. SOVEL:

To the extent that that phrase might

6

be tantamount to something that is discoverable by a

7

reasonable inspection, I would plead the answer is yes.

8

It's a question -- is it something that can be seen and be

9

determined by the crew of the ship conducting the normal

10
11

type of inspection that they would be?
QUESTION:

So, your theory is, if it's an open

12

and obvious problem in the cargo stow area, then the

13

shipowner is liable if in the unloading process someone is

14

injured by virtue of that condition?

15

MR. SOVEL:

If it was open and obvious -- and

16

they have become somewhat words of art and I want to use

17

them carefully if I may -- if it was open and obvious

18

sufficiently to be observed at the time of loading, even

19

though it may subsequently, in the course of loading, be

20

concealed, it is a condition that the shipowner should be

21

responsible, because it is the type of condition which

22

would -- he would have knowledge of if he made the

23

observation.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, what if it's open and obvious

before, during and after the original loading, and it is

2

open and obvious at the time of the unloading?
MR. SOVEL:

If it's open and obvious at the time

3

of the unloading, insofar as there might be any duty to

4

warn of that condition, the fact that it is open and

5

obvious constitutes the warning.

6

would still remain as to whether, assuming we have an open

7

and obvious condition that is unsafe -- which is what you

8

had in the Woods decision from the Fifth Circuit and in

9

the Riggs decision from the Ninth Circuit -- there -- the

However, the question

10

-- the -- the condition of that stow may still be such

11

that it cannot be discharged with reasonable safety, and

12

then the shipowner's negligence would survive the fact

13

that it is open and obvious and would still be --

14

QUESTION:

Was -- was there a finding by the

15

District Court here that the plastic that was laid under

16

the cargo was an open and obvious condition?

17

MR. SOVEL:

Not in -- not in that sense.

What

18

the trial judge here stated, that based on the argument

19

that the presence of the plastic would have been open and

20

obvious to the loading longshoremen, that therefore, since

21

it was open and obvious, the -- under Scindia, the

22

shipowner wasn't liable.

23

it wasn't open and obvious to the discharging

24

longshoremen.

25

total non sequitur.

But that ignores the fact that

It was concealed by that.

And it was a

QUESTION:

1

Well, I just thought -- I just

2

thought that the District Court had made a finding that it

3

was open and obvious.
MR. SOVEL:

4

No.

The District Court, in essence,

5

made an argument that if we were arguing that it could

6

have been observed by the loading stevedore and was open

7

and obvious to them, then, by definition, it had to be

8

open and obvious to the discharging longshoremen or to the

9

discharging stevedore.

If there's no finding in the sense of

it being in a bench trial?

22

There was no

That is correct.
Now, are you saying that the

shipowner had a duty to inspect here?
MR. SOVEL:

I -- I'm saying that the shipowner

24

has a duty to conduct reasonable inspections of the manner

25

in which the cargo is stowed, yes.

QUESTION:

Well, what's your authority for that

proposition?
MR. SOVEL:

My -- my authority for that

4

proposition is the general negligence duty created by

5

Scindia, which it would be no different than inspecting

6

for other conditions which exist on a ship when the ship

7

comes in and is presented to the discharging longshoremen.

say, by the shipowner, but there is undoubtedly negligence

by the person providing stevedoring services.

2

MR. SOVEL:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, by the -- but -And the statute reads, it seems to

4

me, very clearly, that if the injured person was employed

10

That clause is
It was not applicable

in Scindia.
MR. SOVEL:

11

No -- that cause, which also was

employer stevedore.

It's -- it's flat -- it's a flat

It doesn't limit it the way you say it.
MR. SOVEL:

Okay.

But the decision of this

19

Court in Kopke v. Cooper Steve -- Cooper Stevedoring v.

20

Kopke made the decision between the employer stevedore and

21

the nonemployer stevedore for purposes of section 5, in

22

which it held that just because you had an employer

23

stevedore who was -- because that employer -- that

24

stevedore, who was not the employer, was subject to suit

by the -- an injured longshoreman and by the shipowner as

1

well, who stood in the sues -- in the shoes of the

2

longshoreman in that situation.

3

The consistent decision has always been that the

4

employer term refers to the employers of the injured

5

longshoreman -- even though you could have -- the Act

6

itself defines employer as any employer of longshoremen or

7

any stevedore -- the language has always been that the

8

exclusive remedy provisions of section 5, which limit the

9

remedy of the longshoreman against his employer, against

10

the stevedore, only apply to the employer stevedore.

So, the -- but coming back to Kopke, Kopke is a

And they -- this Court, in Kopke, specifically

they were saying that the shipowner would not be liable

for a negligence of the stevedore in the context that

they're referring to the employer stevedore.

Essentially, that's the same argument that --

If you were to take that language totally,

Justice Scalia, then you would be eliminating liability

based on joint negligence.

And suppose you have a situation where you had

Under the interpretation of that language --

QUESTION:

MR. SOVEL:

Which is what we have here.
Yes -- well -- and therefore -- but

10

that was specifically rejected in the Edmonds case.

11

was the specific argument that was made and the specific

12

-- it was rejected -- that the shipowner cannot excuse its

own negligence by saying that the stevedore was also

negligent.

QUESTION:

That

negligence was -- was independent, separate negligence,

crushes the longshoreman, kills him, and the box of cargo

5

The cargo owner could then sue the ship, but the

I don't think Congress ever had any idea that

that's what this statute would intent to result in.
QUESTION:

9

Maybe it should have written

something else then if it didn't have such an idea.
MR. SOVEL:

10

Well, I think it did when it said

11

that they have negligence based on State law.

12

addressing the issue of the fact that we're not -- we

13

wanted to make sure that the exclusive remedy provisions

14

of the statute would not be interpreted in such a way as

15

to make the employer longshoreman liable for any more than

16

its compensation liability.

going to say the legislative history prevails over the

inconsistent between the phrase that the shipowner shall

MR. SOVEL:

QUESTION:

2

MR. SOVEL:

Isn't that fair to say?
Yes.

And I think that they have a

duty, under Scindia, to provide a ship which is in such

condition that it can be discharged with reasonable

safety.

how that cargo stow then becomes unsafe is really

irrelevant.

How does one discharge that duty?

To

what extent is there an obligation to supervise the

10

stowing of the cargo to make sure that the ship is in safe

condition to be unloaded when it gets to the unloading

12

port?

13

MR. SOVEL:

To the extent that the term

14

"supervising" implies anything more than the observations

that they would make of the normal stowage, I'm not

claiming that there's a duty to supervise.

I am claiming

Right.
So, can you be as precise as you can

in telling me how one discharges that duty?
MR. SOVEL:

Okay.

It would, in various cases,

24

depend upon the type of cargo that is being handled.

whatever it is that they're supplying, when they admit

that they have to make sure that something is under the

stow of cocoa beans, that they would be observing to see

4

that is present -- they've admitted that.

5

In the case where you have improperly stowed

steel, such as Woods or Riggs or those cases, just looking

at the cargo is all they have to do.

bring in testimony that they looked and observed the cargo

and saw it.

QUESTION:

10

In fact, you can

Well, what is it that -- what is the

relevant thing that they've admitted here?
MR. SOVEL:

12

Here they admitted, first of all,

13

that they -- they inspected; that they would have seen the

14

plastic if it was placed under it; that they required that

15

something be placed under the cocoa beans so that, to that

16

extent -- by the way, they're supervising what the

stevedore does, they are giving them the material -- the

Basically, that case -- and I always maintained

a prima facie case of vessel liability because you have

the part of the shipowner of the condition and that the

Based on Derr, in preparing this case and

And the testimony of

The District Court stated in the opinion, in a

part of the opinion -- which I have to say very

11

respectfully to the District judge -- makes no sense.

12

Because he said was, well, if this condition was capable

of being discovered by the loading longshoremen in

Guayaquil, Ecuador, then, by definition, it was an open

and obvious condition.

the way, is contrary to the holding in Scindia -- and from

that he says, therefore, it had to be open and obvious to

the plaintiff in this case, when there clearly was

evidence it was not open and obvious to him.

21

And under Scindia, the shipowner

I mean, the decision -- the statement that if it

was open and obvious to the loading longshoremen at the

time it was created, by definition, it has to be open and

3

Now, in the Edmonds situation --

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Buchholz, I can see what you're

5

saying if we were dealing with the typical triad -- that

6

is, this certainly meant to exonerate the shipowner from

7

liability to the employer of the longshore worker.

8

the things that stem from Ryan and the -- the usual dance

of suing the shipowner, the shipowner turning and making a

claim over against the stevedoring company.

what's involved here.

12

So,

That's not

Why does it follow that because Congress

certainly meant to do that and did that, that there would

be no liability where the injured worker is not employed

by the -- where we have an unloading longshore worker, and

he is injured because of the -- of negligence attributed

7

to the loading stevedore?

8
9

MR. BUCHHOLZ:
Your Honor.

There are two answers to that,

One is there is no basis to, as a matter of

20

law or a matter of fact -- essentially, you get into a

21

distinction between perhaps a foreign-loading stevedore

22

and a domestic stevedore, who is covered under this Act.

23

And there is no distinction to create separate duties on

24

what the shipowner's duty is vis-a-vis the cargo, as to

25

whether it's a foreign stevedore that's loading it or a

as Justice O'Connor said -- the ship in fact had supplied

1

matter of fact -- and that's what you've been debating now

2

-- there was actual knowledge and therefore you were

3

negligent.

4

that's purely factual.

5

as I understand it, is regardless of what they did or did

6

not know or anything else, they had a duty to supervise or

7

inspect the loading operation.

10

to see things there, but if you didn't have any duty you
wouldn't have been doing it negligently.
So, the legal issue is -- am I not correct -- I

11
12

And the other alternative theory,

And they -- you -- you can admit that you failed

8

9

But that's not really much of a legal issue;

mean, is it just whether you had that duty at that time?
MR. BUCHHOLZ:

13

Well, again, the legal duty, as

14

Justice Kennedy referred to throughout, the difference

15

between the Ninth and the Fifth in the Circuit is whether

16

there is a legal duty to do inspections or supervisions of

17

the cargo stow during the loading by the stevedore.
QUESTION:

18

And if there is such a duty, the fact

19

that you don't know about it, you would lose under this?

20

But --

21

MR. BUCHHOLZ:

QUESTION:

1

And what this boils down to also is

2

that your real defense is, you're not negligent, period?

3

You don't rely on the fact that the loading stevedore was

4

negligent?

MR. BUCHHOLZ:

6

I mean -Well, somebody -- if there was

negligence --

7

QUESTION:

What I'm saying is that, going back

8

to that argument -- the debate between -- or your

9

opponent's colloquy with Justice Scalia earlier -- the

10

fact that the -- the loading stevedore was negligent would

11

not exonerate you if you were also negligent?

12

MR. BUCHHOLZ:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Yes.

But you say you were not

14

negligent because (a) you had no duty to inspect or

15

supervise the loading operation and (b) as a matter of

16

fact, your people didn't realize that this plastic stuff

17

was there?

18

MR. BUCHHOLZ:

19

QUESTION:

Exactly.

Okay.

And why do you assert you had

20

no duty to supervise -- or -- the unloading -- the loading

21

22

MR. BUCHHOLZ:

That is a duty that has -- that

23

the genesis is the Ninth Circuit's case in Turner.

felt -- was faced with a situation in which an injured

25

longshoreman was hurt.

the situation and realized that the negligence had been

2

that of a foreign stevedore, and decided that the

3

longshoreman didn't have anyone to sue.

4

around and said, well, we're going to create a -- a

5

liability on the shipowner to have had supervised the

6

loading of the foreign stevedore to prevent any defects in

7

the stow.

8

9
10
11

So, they turned

And, again, that doesn't reconcile with your
holding Scindia that you don't have a duty to supervise
the minute details of the loading operation.
And the fact of the matter is, if you put any

12

duty other than the duty I discussed with Justice Scalia,

13

where you have actual knowledge of a dangerous hazard

14

which you knew or should have known would create an

15

unreasonable risk of harm, if you put any duty of

16

reasonable inspection it will essentially open up every

17

one of these cases to a third-party lav/suit.

18

Any stevedoring expert can come in after an

19

accident and say, a reasonable inspection would have

disclosed this.

if it was sufficiently obvious that any competent vessel

Well, of course, that's still true in

MR. BUCHHOLZ:

8

QUESTION:

10

Excuse me?

That's still true in an actual

knowledge case.
MR. BUCHHOLZ:

In an actual case, there's a

11

basis to impose liability on the shipowner for that

12

situation, though.

13

QUESTION:

Is it possible that a condition could

14

be open and obvious at the time that the owner starts the

15

voyage, after the cargo has been loaded, but during the

16

course of the -- the trip, the cargo shifts around so that

17

on arrival it is not open and obvious and, yet, the owner

18

would have been aware because it was open and obvious?

19

MR. BUCHHOLZ:

In that situation, again, you --

20

you have actual knowledge of a -- of a -- a -- if you have

21

actual knowledge, which --

22

QUESTION:

No, I didn't say that there was, but

23

just that it was an open and obvious condition initially,

24

and it changed later.

MR. BUCHHOLZ:

Well, if -- if it's an open and

1

obvious condition -- if the shipowner does not have actual

2

knowledge of it, no, there is -- there is no such duty.

3

Because, again, then you'll get into a factual question in

4

every one of these cases as to what the shipowner should

5

have seen at the time of loading.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Buchholz, I'm -- you know, I'm

7

really not sure that your -- your -- your alarmist

8

prediction of what's going to happen is -- is true to

9

life.

If -- if, indeed, the shipowner should have known,

10

there will always be available the argument that he did

11

know.

12

suspect expert witnesses that you're worried about.

13

And so, you'll have the same parade of -- of these

The -- the only question we're arguing about is

14

whether these suspect expert witnesses are going to say,

15

yes, he must have known, and therefore he knew, or whether

16

they're just going to say, well, he should have known.

17

that -- is that that big a deal?

18

MR. BUCHHOLZ:

Is

I mean --

Yes, Your Honor.

I -- I think

19

you don't get to court as you see in this case unless you

20

prove actual knowledge -- unless you can prove there were

21

long -- crew members --

22

QUESTION:

As we've established in Justice

23

Stevens' question, you're going to win this case under

24

either approach.

MR. BUCHHOLZ:

Right.

1

Whether you're liable for should have

2

known or not.

But you're worried about other cases.

And

3

you say, well, gee, if -- if you make "should have known"

4

enough for liability, we're going to have this parade of

suspect expert witnesses.

MR. BUCHHOLZ:

I don't think there's -- there

has been a very limited number of cases in the Third

Circuit where this duty has been imposed for -- for

10

exactly that reason -- that the standard under the Derr

case is admittedly extremely limited.
QUESTION:

If you should have known, it's

question, doesn't it?

MR. BUCHHOLZ:

And so it becomes a jury

QUESTION:

Well, the typical case is -- is the

one that Justice Stevens gave -- gave of the cargo

shiftings.

have warned.

You know, any idiot would have -- should have

no good; you have to show that he knew.

That's not a subject of expert

testimony, whether someone knew or not.

QUESTION:

No, but -- but the point he's making

is if you have this theory, you -- you would -- you would

open the case so that experts could be -- could be brought

in.

I don't see the difference between should have

MR. BUCHHOLZ:

I don't see that making a

Having tried cases since 1970 and

11

seen what changes the Derr situation made in the Third

12

Circuit, I -- I have to respectfully differ with you.

13

made a considerable difference.

14

Rehnquist pointed out, actual knowledge is far different

than should have, or would have, or could have, that an

expert may be able to testify.

The courts just don't permit -- they take a very

close scrutiny as to what actual testimony -- what actual

19

knowledge is in the record, if there is any.

not there, there -- there is no cause of action.
QUESTION:

And if it's

Is there -- are there occasions when

You're taking something out of the hold and -- and putting

it in at the same -- and putting another cargo in at the

1

Yes.

It's not necessarily the

loading one hatch, taking it out at another hatch.

Usually, it's not in the -- vis-a-vis the same hatch, it's

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

Unless there is any additional questions, I have

nothing further, but would request this Court to affirm

the decision of the Third Circuit and the lower court in

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES SOVEL

17

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

18

MR. SOVEL:

If the Court please:

1

First of all, one of the problems in the record

20

in this case is that the District Court judge did resolve

21

issues of -- where there really are factual issues.

22

Because there is a factual issue here as to knowledge of

23

the shipowner and the captain of this condition.

24

we presented the testimony that the ship supplied it; that

25

the -- required something to be placed under it.

Because

1

That alone is sufficient to at least raise a

factual issue to be determined by a factfinder as to

whether they would have actual knowledge of its presence.

It's an inference to be drawn from those facts alone.

Well, I thought there was also

And that's a very

that, well, it could have been used for other things.

11

The only other evidence in this record as to

another use of the plastic was to the -- in connection

13

with the loading of corrosive drums -- drums containing

14

corrosive materials.

which are not corrosive.

argument, as to that being a permissible purpose.

There was never

did this, we observed the cargo, and if he says, I didn't

QUESTION:

Because unless he

contend that.

though he doesn't admit to seeing it, we infer from other

evidence that he did see it.

MR. SOVEL:

And if there isn't, then the jury

That's right.

But in -- in this

case, there was evidence on which they could find that.

5

But under Mr. Buchholz's test, if he brings in somebody to
