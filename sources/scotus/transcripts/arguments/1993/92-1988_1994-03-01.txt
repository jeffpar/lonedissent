ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. TARANTO

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. TARANTO:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case presents the question whether it is

11

constitutionally permissible to insist that certain claims

12

be litigated all at once in a single Federal class action,

13

rather than through numerous repetitive and possibly

14

inconsistent lawsuits.

15

Our position is, first, that there is no due

16

process bar to this useful procedure where, as is no

17

longer disputed in this case, the class action court has

18

jurisdiction over the class and the interests of the class

19

members were fairly represented.

20

Where those conditions are met, the choice

21

whether to have a mandatory class action for particular

22

kinds of claim should remain only a matter of policy,

23

including where monetary claims are at stake, and second,

24

even if the Constitution requires more than the interest

25

in avoiding multiple suits to justify mandatory class

1

action, such as the interest reflected in (b)(1) and

2

(b)(2) of current Rule 23, those additional interests are

3
4

present in this case.
Now, if I can put aside the question of personal

5

jurisdiction, which is now conceded here, I want to begin

6

with the relevant history as to class actions.

7

history has two aspects, the first --

8

9

QUESTION:

That

Mr. Taranto, I hope in your history

you will cover whether you think (b)(2) and (b)(3)

10

classifications are interchangeable so that if you have a

11

group where some might prefer the (b)(3) class, that is,

12

making compensatory damages the thing, and others are

13

content with the (b)(2) classification, a court can

14

nonetheless force on the people who might prefer the

15

(b)(3) class the one in which you cannot opt out.

16

MR. TARANTO:

I think that as a constitutional

17

matter, it is permissible for the rulemakers or for

18

Congress to decide that once the conditions of numerosity

19

and adequate representation are fully guaranteed, that the

20

interests in having a single mandatory class and therefore

21

denying opt-out rights are constitutionally sufficient,

22

necessarily notwithstanding the desire of certain

23

individuals to pursue their own litigation, and I think,

24

as a constitutional matter, that is in fact consistent

25

with the history of this Court's treatment and the

1

2

evolution of the rules.
This Court has, beginning in the 1854 case of

3

Smith, on through the insurance benefit cases in the early

4

decades of this century, then on through Hansberry v. Lee

5

and later cases, always identified adequacy of

6

representation as the constitutional benchmark, and some

7

of those cases, notably the insurance cases, specifically

8

involve monetary claims where in some sense (b)(3) in

9

current terms might have been available for certain people

10
11

who wanted to opt out.
What the Court has never done is to declare the

12

particular circumstances where mandatory class actions

13

have been permitted are the only ones where that is

14

constitutionally so, and in particular, the one sentence

15

in Shutts, Phillips Petroleum v. Shutts, that the Ninth

16

Circuit relied on, doesn't do that, because Shutts is only

17

about the prerequisites for personal jurisdiction.

18

The second aspect of the history that I think is

19

important here is precisely the evolution of choices about

20

when mandatory classes are appropriate.

21

choices is, of course, embodied in the current Rule 23.

22

Another set of choices is currently under consideration by

23

the advisory committee.

24
25

One set of

An earlier set of choices was embodied in the
original 1938 rules, and still before that, before the

1

rules in 1938, there was a wide variety of opinion among

2

all sorts of courts about when mandatory class actions

3

were appropriate with -- and the important point about

4

that variety of opinion and the evolution of choices is

5

that the debate has always been on nonconstitutional

6

grounds, insofar as relevant today.

7

trial issue, but that's not any longer a live issue after

8

the merger of law and equity.

9

There was once a jury

So what the history I think stands for is

10

precisely flexibility as a policy matter about when the

11

interests in consolidating all actions in a single

12

proceeding override any remaining individual interest, and

13

that flexibility I think is perfectly correct under the

14

prevailing due process analysis of Mathews v. Eldridge.

15

The reasons for mandatory class actions derive

16

from the basic defining characteristic of numerosity.

17

Where that is present, there are strong interests in

18

avoiding costly, repetitive, possibly inconsistent

19

results, and these interests have a number of overlapping

20

aspects that can appear in different mixes in different

21

kinds of cases.

22

QUESTION:

May I ask if it's your view that if

23

the district judge here had determined that (b)(3) was the

24

appropriate mode for this, that that would also be all

25

right, that this is totally a matter of discretion for the

2

initial trier?
If he styles this a (b)(2) class, then that's

3

okay, but equally, it wouldn't have been wrong, would it,

4

for the trial judge to have said, this case I think

5

belongs under the (b)(3) mold, and there should be notice

6

and an opportunity to opt out, because some people might

7

prefer compensatory relief?

8

9

MR. TARANTO:

I think it is a matter of

discretion in the sense that courts of appeals review

10

certification decisions under a fairly deferential abuse

11

of discretion standard.

12

(b)(3) rather than under (b)(1) or (b)(2) where those

13

conditions are met can in fact be an abuse of discretion.

14

I think a certification under

One of the points that has been made by many

15

courts is that (b)(3) is a kind of catch-all provision,

16

and most cases that would properly fall under(b)(1) and

17

(b)(2) could also come within (b)(3), and the structure of

18

the rules therefore suggest that there will be some cases

19

that really should be categorized under (b)(1) and (b)(2).

20

There are cases, and I think this is properly

21

one, in which at a minimum it was proper to certify the

22

case under (b)(1) and (b)(2).

23

was so clearly proper under those standards that

24

certifying it under (b)(3) instead would have been an

25

abuse of discretion,

Whether the certification

I don't know.

Of course, if this had been certified under

1

2

(b)(3), this whole constitutional issue would not in fact

3

have arisen, because then opt-out rights would have been

4

provided in the original lawsuit.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Taranto, can --do you think a

6

State or Congress could establish a system in which you no

7

longer have the choice of your own lawyer to prosecute

8

causes of action, saying, you know, lawyers have gotten

9

too expensive, we're going to establish a career attorney

10

system, and you simply get assigned your lawyer when you

11

want to vindicate some civil right?
MR. TARANTO:

12

Well, I think that the analysis

13

that would have to be followed would be a Mathews v.

14

Eldridge analysis, and I'm, as I'm standing here,

15

uncertain what kind of weighty State interest there might

16

be in saying that any particular individual has no right

17

to choose an individual's own lawyer.
QUESTION:

18

Well, it should just be expense of

19

attorneys.

20

despite the fact that we've had a tradition that you can

21

pick your own lawyer in the past, it's an open question,

22

and you simply balance -MR. TARANTO:

right against -- against the utility to the State.
MR. TARANTO:

2

Well, I think that what the

3

Mathews v. Eldridge analysis does provide for is the

4

change from earlier, the traditionally established ways of

5

proceeding.
QUESTION:

6

So does what you're proposing.

7

mean, the cases that you've mentioned are cases that

8

involve either equity or limited funds, the historic

9

cases, so this is really a new proposal.
MR. TARANTO:

10

I

Well, the kinds of cases that have

11

been permitted as mandatory class actions under (b)(1) and

12

(b)(2) since 1966 have extended beyond --

Well, I consider --

QUESTION:

175 years too late.

MR. TARANTO:

But the history in particular of

22

monetary claims, and it does go back to 1854, it's a

little --

QUESTION:

It goes back to that date in a very

different context, where you have a limited fund.

1

Everybody can't possibly get it, and maybe you could

2

extend that to the situation where defendant is likely to

3

be bankrupted by too many private claims, and I suppose

4

that would be analogous, but where that isn't -- where

5

that isn't in the cards, or there's no indication of that,

6

and the only problem is there are a lot of lawsuits, I

7

think that's pretty new.
MR. TARANTO:

8

9

Well, I don' think so, Justice

Scalia.
QUESTION:

10

How about a mass tort -- a plane

11

crash, a railroad disaster?

12

mandatory (b)(2), and then after you settle the liability,

13

just have individual hearings on damages?

14

MR. TARANTO:

Could you bring that as a

Well, if the question is as a

15

constitutional matter, I think that the answer is yes.

16

think that rulemakers or Congress could determine that, if

17

the issues are truly common, so that any particular

18

interest is in fact adequately being represented, then a

19

mass tort case could constitutionally be consolidated in a

20

single proceeding.
QUESTION:

21

And a mass tort case in fact isn't,

22

so it remains an academic question.

23

might get a (b)(3) but you would not get a (b)(2) class

24

certified?

MR. TARANTO:

Is it not so that you

1

commonly treated under (b)(3), not under (b)(2).

2

an increasing development to treat at least some aspects

3

of mass tort cases, maybe even all of them, under (b)(1),

4

under (b)(1)(B), which is roughly speaking about limited

5

funds, where the assets of the defendant would -- might

6

well be exhausted by tens of thousands of tort suits, and

7

then the traditional limited fund justification comes in.

8

9

There is

But let me return if I may for 1 minute, it is
true that this Court has not -- had not had to deal with a

10

class action, a mandatory class action outside some broad

11

view of what a limited fund is, but other courts did in

12

fact deal with such cases, and if one looks at some of the

13

prior history, prior to 1938, some of the cases discussed

14

in the influential articles by Professor Chafee, I think

15

what that shows is that various courts were in fact

16

treating the avoidance of multiple litigation as, by

17

itself, a sufficient interest to have a single, mandatory

18

proceeding.

19
20
21

So there is, in fact, some historical precedent
for this, though admittedly not in this Court.
QUESTION:

Congress could repeal outright any

22

private claim of antitrust for antitrust liability against

23

a defendant, couldn't it?

24

MR. TARANTO:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

I think in --

So why couldn't it do this lesser

1

thing of requiring a certain degree of consolidation take

2

place?

3

MR. TARANTO:

I think with respect to a Federal

4

statutory claim, there probably is an additional

5

congressional power to, in effect, condition the kinds of

6

proceedings in which certain kinds of claims created by

7

Congress can be brought.
This case, of course, is one in which we do have

8

9

a Federal statutory claim, but I do think that as a

10

constitutional due process matter the point extends

11

further, and the basic reason is, aside from the fact that

12

I think the history is relatively open on the subject and

13

precisely allows flexibility of choice, is that what's on

14

the individual side of the balance is an interest in

15

controlling one's own litigation to ensure against

16

incorrect adjudication or unfair compromise.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Taranto, your response to the

18

Chief Justice surely doesn't suggest that simply because

19

Congress can eliminate a claim entirely it can provide for

20

that claim to be tried with any process whatever?
MR. TARANTO:

22

No, I don't think that's right.

I

2

nonetheless.
MR. TARANTO:

Yes, I think that's right, but

3

what Congress has done in a number of contexts is to say,

4

in particular when an administrative agency makes a

5

ruling, sets prices, for example, under the price

6

administration regime of World War II, that there shall be

7

one forum at one time in which that can be challenged, and

8

if -- I assume there are hundreds of such challenges

9

brought within the 30 days in the D.C. circuit or the

10

Emergency Court of Appeals.

11

necessarily, some kind of consolidated, representative

12

proceeding in which that claim will be heard.

13

There is going to be,

What the mandatory class action device does is

14

essentially mirror that kind of consolidated proceeding

15

where the justification of numerosity calls for it.

16

Now, many different choices, I think are

17

permissible about when that can -- that ought to be done,

18

and the current rules clearly do weigh different interests

19

somewhat differently.

20

(b)(1) and (b)(2) are interests that the rulemakers deem

21

somewhat greater of greater weight than the interest

22

present in what -- in the residual (b)(3) category.

23

addition to the shear burden of multiple litigation, there

24

are the additional interests of avoiding inconsistent

25

obligations or the so-called cohesion interests that

In

1

respondents refer to.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Taranto, given the reflection of

3

those interests, if you're right on due process, does a

4

court have any discretion in applying preclusion rules?

5

In other words if we were to say, sure, there's no due

6

process problem in your position, does that -- does that

7

leave a court with any opportunity to hear a claim simply

8

based on the inappropriateness of applying preclusion in a

9

given case, given the fact that the preclusion rules

10

themselves embody a -- ultimately a flexible, a kind of an

11

equitable circuit breaker standard?
MR. TARANTO:

12

I think so.

I mean, the --

13

Rule 23 does not itself determine the preclusive effect of

14

judgments.

15

everybody included within the judgment shall be bound by

16

the judgment but does not itself lay down the preclusion

17

rules.

18

a matter of Federal common law, and those rules, if one

19

looks at the Restatement or this Court's cases, basically

20

say that a representative action where adequacy of

21

representation is guaranteed shall have preclusive effect.

22

It plainly was intended to provide that

The preclusion rules continue, by and large, to be

There are certain elements of discretion

23

embodied in those rules, but in general the finality and

24

efficiency purposes that preclusion rules are designed to

25

serve do in fact require a certain measure of clarity as

1

to those standards as well, and therefore the discretion

2

as to preclusion is relatively minimal, though there is a

3

genuine important judgment to be made about when the

4

representation was truly adequate.
Now, that judgment, of course, was made in this

5
6

case.

7

the Philadelphia class action in this case was a challenge

8

based on adequate representation.

9

The principal challenge to the binding effect of

QUESTION:

But would it make any sense to

10

conclude here that the representation was adequate, again

11

so far as any due process standard might be concerned.

12

was certainly adequate in the sense of competence, but

13

that there was in fact at least a sufficient disparity of

14

interest between, we'll say, the intending Arizona

15

plaintiffs here, so that for res judicata purposes we

16

would not apply preclusion against them.

17

there any way that would make sense?

18

MR. TARANTO:

Would that -- is

Well, let me say two things about

19

that.

20

a question about adequacy of representation that is not

21

presented in his Court, but second, I think in this

22

particular case that would not make sense.

First, I think that that would necessarily present

If one puts oneself back in the framework of

24

1985 and 1986, and looks in particular at the dispute over

1

were different in relevant respects from the other States

2

affected by the class, I think it is very hard to question

3

the judgment of not only adequate but in fact quite

4

vigorous representation.

5

Recall, back in '85, within 3 months of the

6

filing of this lawsuit, this Court decided the Southern

7

Motor Carriers case, suddenly creating a much more

8

substantial -- indeed, what the district court in

9

Philadelphia thought, a pretty clearly winning State

10

action defense on antitrust grounds.

11

There is also the McCarran-Ferguson question,

12

which has still not been finally resolved in this case.

13

Those are questions that, of course, have taken the FTC

14

9 years to litigate, and the judgment is still not final

15

as to them.

16

Beyond those two questions there is at least the

17

question, not present in the FTC case, of seeking damages,

18

and where damages are alleged, there would be the

19

additional burden of establishing that, even if the

20

participation in the rating bureaus was illegal under the

21

antitrust laws, that the resulting rates were higher than

22

what they would have been in a purely competitive system.

23

And with respect to all of those factors, what

24

Judge Van Artsdellon decided, and what the lower courts in

25

this case decided, was that there really were no concrete

1

appreciable differences between Arizona and Wisconsin on

2

the one hand, and the other States on the other.

3

And whatever differences there may have been

4

were so outweighed by the prospect of 9 years of

5

additional litigation, all for the prospect of possibly no

6

damages at the end of the day, that it was a perfectly

7

reasonable, responsible choice of a vigorous advocate to

8

say, we will settle for the following sorts of injunctive

9

relief, some of which is retrospective, in the sense that

10

11

of the class, and so I think in this particular case there

12

really is no ground for deciding that some higher level of

13

representative adequacy is necessary.

14

QUESTION:

I suppose it would follow from what

15

you say that it would at least be constitutionally open to

16

provide a trial regime in which a Court could conclude

17

that one were -- that a given plaintiff was not subject to

18

a summary judgment motion, and was not subject to a

19

dismissal motion, but on grounds of unlikelihood of

20

success, in effect could suffer a dismissal, because that

21

in effect is the standard by which you are judging, or I

22

think you were judging the reasonableness of the decision

23

that was made about the adequate representation of those

24

who wanted to go all the way for damages, or at least

25

claimed they did.

MR. TARANTO:

Well, I think it is important to

2

separate the question of adequacy of representation

3

leading to an adjudicated decision and adequacy of

4

representation leading to a settlement, although the two

5

are necessarily, in practical terms, interlinked.

6

Here, I think, in fact both of those that the

7

representation was perfectly adequate as to both, just as

8

I think it was perfectly reasonable to certify this

9

particular class under both (b)(1) and (b)(2), and (b)(1),

10

the critical point is -- what (b)(1) says is that we

11

should certify a class if there's a risk of varying

12

inconsistent or varying adjudications.

13

And what that has been used for time and again

14

are cases not simply in which the defendant might be told

15

by one court to do something and another court to do

16

precisely the opposite, but rather for a whole range of

17

circumstances involving Government benefits and other

18

kinds of situations where the defendant has some kind of

19

legal obligation to act consistently toward all the

20

plaintiff class.

21

Here, the defendants do have that obligation,

22

and they have that obligation not only prospectively in

23

terms of the rates that they would charge or their

24

behavior in establishing insurance rates within a

25

particular State, but retrospectively as well, because any

wasn't there a question in the complaint originally for

MR. TARANTO:

Well, there were a dozen

complaints, eventually reduced to, I think, nine.

Some of

10

them asked for (b)(3), some of them did not specify.

11

simply said, under Rule 23.

12

complaints did not specify what subsection they were

seeking to proceed under.

That would, though, however, have been quite

15

dramatically changed by this Court's decision in Southern

16

Motor Carriers, because by the time the FTC brought its

17

action in early 1985, and these actions were then filed

18

literally within days of the FTC action, the participation

19

in the rating bureaus was by and large over, so in that

20

sense, at that time, they were mostly looking for

21

retrospective relief.

22

What Southern Motor Carriers did was suddenly,

23

in a very real sense, to raise the prospect of future

24

participation in rating bureaus being permitted.

25

was now something very much forward-looking to think

MR. TARANTO:

At what

Well, I think that if the question

11

of certification is not a constitutional one, then I think

12

the question of certification is not open in a separate

13

collateral suit.

14

the various attorneys general who pursued this interest in

15

the Philadelphia action, were entitled to, and did, press

16

the question of certification in that action and took an

17

appeal and eventually cert was denied.

only be in (b)(3) but not in those circumstances where

QUESTION:

But any time before final judgment.

13

MR. TARANTO:

Yes, I think so, and indeed, that

14

issue was taken up to the Third Circuit eventually on

15

certiorari, but one reason I think that, aside from the

16

fact that this is a case in which (b)(1) and (b)(2) were

17

found to be present and have not been challenged in this

18

Court, and I think were quite proper because of the need

19

for uniformity in the treatment by defendants of all of

20

their consumers, even aside from that,

21

important reason why the current Rule 23 categories

22

shouldn't be constitutionalized any more than the original

one of the other side is claiming that it was wrong to

2

make this a mandatory class as distinguished from a

3

class -- from a (b)(3) class in which people can opt out?

4

I thought that was what the case was about on the other

5

side, that there was a constitutional right here to

6

notice, and an opportunity to opt out, and that was -- it

7

was wrong for the district judge in Philadelphia to

8

preclude that, and it remains wrong, and that it's a

matter of due process.

10

I thought that was the very

argument the other side was making.
MR. TARANTO:

11

I agree that the argument the

other side is making is that due process requires an opt-

monetary claimants.

claims have always -QUESTION:

But if we interpret the current rule

right along that the certification, as Justice Ginsburg

2

suggested, is only good for equitable relief?

3

MR. TARANTO:

As a constitutional matter they

4

have made an argument that adequate representation is not

5

present, and that due process under Shutts always requires

6

monetary claims to be separated out, which it plainly

7

cannot do in (b)(1), and I don't think it needs to in

8

(b)(2) either, and even if it were -- that were true under

9

(b)(2) as a matter of interpreting the rule, I don't think

10
11

it's true as a constitutional matter.
QUESTION:

If it follows that for the monetary

12

claims the people who would like to press such claims

13

can't be taken out, then the label that you put on it,

14

then you say well, to that extent it belongs under (b)(3),

15

but the claims don't come into court with some kind of

16

magic label ahead of time.

17

If you decide that there is -- that the damage

18

claim is something that can't be cut out because some

19

people in the group like it that way better than others,

20

then the classification is under (b)(3).

21

MR. TARANTO:

I think that that is an argument

22

that was made in the Philadelphia proceeding, can be made

23

under the rules, but the constitutional question is

MR. NORTH:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
I think there is a nonconstitutional basis for

9
10

deciding this case, and it has been asserted, it was

11

argued in the Ninth Circuit, and it's been argued here.

12

It stems, however, not from whether the certification in

13

MDL 633 was itself proper, but whether the judgment below,

14

in determining the preclusive effect of the judgment, was

15

proper.

record is quite clear, is the cases both as individually

No proceeding

MR. NORTH:

We were absent parties in the case,

2

so we never really had an opportunity to object, and

never accepted by the MDL 633 court in a parens patriae

11

capacity, only in their capacity as representing the State

12

and its subdivisions, which also had a damage interest.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. North, the question which we

14

granted certiorari is whether a Federal court may refuse

15

to enforce the judgment in Nationwide class actions

16

certified under Rule 23 on the ground that unnamed class

17

members have a constitutional right to opt out of any

18

class action asserting monetary claims.

21

Now, your argument here is directed to really
what is an alternate ground for affirmance, I take it.
MR. NORTH:

It is, although that we do argue

22

that the answer to the certified question is that yes, the

23

district court most certainly can refuse to give

24

preclusive effect, and we believe this Court's decision in

25

Shutts establishes that.

MR. NORTH:

Shutts has been argued, and we were guilty of

this below as well, to some extent, in terms of personal

6

jurisdiction by many, many courts and many parties, but

7

when it is read in light of its predecessor decision,

8

Hansberry v. Lee, it can't mean that.

9

The basic principle that's at issue here is the

10

principle that parties that are not -- persons who are not

11

party to a lawsuit may not be bound by a judgment entered

12

in that litigation, and that an attempt to enforce such a

13

judgment against such a person is violative of both the

14

Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments, and that is in the

15

critical paragraph spanning pages 40 to 41 of Hansberry v.

16

Lee.

17

So we already know that there is a principle

18

that is equally applicable under the Fifth and Fourteenth

19

Amendment.

principle, which is what our opponents urge.

the exception which is the class case.

22

and subsequently this Court's decision in Shutts, sets out

required for that exception for class representation type

litigation to overcome the more basic principle.

QUESTION:

3

There was no right to

Certainly reasonable people could

4

disagree,

5

opinion as to whether it's dealing with personal

6

jurisdiction or procedural due process.

7

I think, about your reading of the Shutts

MR. NORTH:

Reasonable people have disagreed, so

8

the answer must be that they could, but the truth is --

9

the truth is that it doesn't stand analysis, because the

10

due process protections accorded absent class members

11

stems from the Due Process Clause, not from Article 3, so

12

all of the arguments that are made by our opponents about

13

the greater sovereignty of the United States v. that of

14

individual States has nothing to do with the right that is

15

being asserted, which stems from the Due Process Clause,

16

the same clause that appears both in the Fifth and

17

Fourteenth Amendments.

18

In fact, this Court, when dealing with foreign

19

nationals, has treated their right to protection from

20

jurisdiction of any United States court as stemming also

21

from the Due Process Clause, not from Article 3, so

22

arguments about greater sovereignty of a Federal court

23

potentially, had Congress granted that, versus a State

court, really can't be what Shutts is about.

1

jurisdictional requirements for State courts dealing with

2

these sort of things as opposed to Federal courts.

3

MR. NORTH:

Well, it could, but it doesn't seem

4

that it is, because the pattern of thinking and the

5

pattern of argument reflected in Shutts is the same as is

6

reflected in Hansberry v. Lee and Mullane.

7

In each case, this Court addressed first the

8

territorial jurisdictional issue and concluded that State

9

courts did have territorial jurisdiction to entertain

10

class actions in which some of the class members were

11

nonresident.

12

Having disposed of that issue, as this Court did

13

in Shutts by concluding that there was no requirement for

14

minimum contacts by absent class members, the Court then

15

went on and described what was required as a matter of

16

minimal due process, and it does so in terms of a host of

17

protections that are traditionally thought of in terms of

18

procedural due process equally owed by a Federal court.

19

There is nothing in the opinion, other than in

20

responding to the personal jurisdiction arguments that had

21

been raised below, that suggests that the decision should

22

not apply to a Federal court.

23

If Shutts has not resolved this issue, however,

24

and if a Mathews analysis is appropriate for the first

25

time in this case, then we submit that the absent class

members win hands down, and they do because there is no --

2

no competing governmental interest to weigh in the

3

balance.

4

The argument that has been asserted here is that

5

if we allow opt-outs we will have multiple suits.

6

(b)(3) actions avoid multiple suits just as readily as

7

(b)(2) actions, with the exception --

QUESTION:

Well,

You concede that there are class

actions that would fit in the (b)(1) or the (b)(2)

category where it is not necessary to give individual

notice and an opportunity to opt out.

MR. NORTH:

Well, we concede that the rules so

provide, and that this Court has allowed such actions in

14

the past, yes.

That's certainly true.

15

QUESTION:

For example, for injunctive relief.

16

MR. NORTH:

But typically in those cases the

17

individual interest and the value of having an opt-out

The damage case presents some peculiar problems

That is why there is a greater need for opt-out.

That is why (b)(3) has typically been

efficacious in cases involving monetary damages.

QUESTION:

Mr. Taranto brought up the limited

14

15

could force -- you could have a mandatory class, force

16

everyone into the forum to get pieces of this very limited

17

pie.

18

MR. NORTH:

Well, the constitutional issues, if

19

there are any, in a (b)(1)(B) class action have perhaps

20

more to do with Article 3 and the interrelationship of

21

sitting Federal judges and bankruptcy judges than any of

22

the issues that have been presented in this case.

23

those issues really haven't been joined in this case, we

24

would have to concede that in that situation a mandatory

25

class is appropriate.

Since

The governmental interest in avoiding multiple

1

2

suits, we contend, is equally protected in (b)(3) actions

3

with one exception, and the one exception is where, in the

4

case of a settlement class, the settlement is not fair to

5

all of the claimants, and where the settlement is not

6

fair, the governmental interest in avoiding multiple cases

7

must give way to the fairness that is owed to the

8

adversely affected class members.

9

Few people opt out of settlements that are fair,

10

particularly where they need to then go fund the

11

litigation, and particularly in class action situations

12

where the amount of damages typically is not as large as a

13

normal private suit might involve.

14

So the reason for attempting to avoid opt-out

15

can't be because there's a strong governmental interest in

16

avoiding multiple suits.

17

defendants seek to avoid all future litigation in the

18

settlement, seek to use it as a way to cut off any future

19

claims.

20

The principal reason is because

Well, allowing that to occur certainly does

21

foster greater efficiency in the sense that it ends

22

litigation, but it doesn't foster greater fairness.

23

opt-out is allowed, those who opt out are opting out

24

because they believe their claims will be adversely

25

affected by the settlement that is proposed, or in the

about this, that you had to be given a right to opt out,

12

Why didn't you have to assert that right in

MR. NORTH:

Two reasons.

First, I believe

13

Hansberry v. Lee and its progeny established that

14

collateral attacks of the kind brought here are the

15

appropriate vehicle for testing the preclusive effect of

16

such a judgment, but more importantly, as I think I

17

mentioned a few moments ago, there was no first class mail

18

notice in this case, so that most, if not all the affected

19

class, did not know there was anything to object to.

20

It is true that a handful of States attorneys

21

general knew about the case, and one way or the other, a

22

handful of individuals learned about the case through

23

notice by publication, but most of the class, most of the

people whose claims were foreclosed, purportedly, never

25

knew that that was happening.

QUESTION:

Mr. North, am I not correct that you

argued that the notice was not only inadequate as a

MR. NORTH:

1

It depends on how you look at what

2

actually transpired in MDL 633, because technically the

3

complaints never were amended to drop the damage claims,

4

but as a practical matter and by judicial decision, they

5

were.

6

The class lawyers who had brought these treble

7

damage claims, clearly (b)(3) type cases, decided they

8

would not pursue those claims because they didn't think

9

they'd win, so they brought, in effect, another case, and

10

then traded the claims they were no longer going to pursue

11

for the claims they now wished to pursue, the net result

12

being the payment of substantial attorneys fees and no

13

recovery for the class.

14

That's what we object to.

We think there's two

15

ways of looking at that.

16

itself was okay under (b)(1) and (b)(2), but what was

17

improper was the attempt by the trial court in 633 to

18

foreclose damage claims that were never really litigated.

19

QUESTION:

One is that the certification

What would the class -- assuming the

20

class loses here, would they have a cause of action
