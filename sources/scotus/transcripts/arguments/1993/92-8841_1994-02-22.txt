ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL PESCETTA

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. PESCETTA:

9

QUESTION:

10

Is that an accurate pronunciation of

the name?
MR. PESCETTA:

11
12

Thank you, Your Honor.

Yes, very accurate, Your Honor,

thank you.

13

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:

14

The issue upon which this Court granted

15

certiorari in this case is a very narrow one, and I submit

16

it becomes even narrower in light of the questions that

17

are not contested by respondent or any party in this case.

18

And I'd like to begin, if I may, by emphasizing what is

19

not an issue, as we understand it.

20

First, no one before the Court, as I understand

21

it, is asking this Court to reconsider Griffith v.

22

Kentucky, and therefore I would submit that it is conceded

23

before this Court that any Federal constitutional decision

24

which is currently in effect must be applied to any

25

decision on the merits of Mr. Powell's case, since his

1

case is not yet final on direct appeal.

2

I submit it is further not contested before this

3

Court that there was a presumptive McLaughlin violation in

4

this case, because the 48 -- the petitioner did not

5

receive a judicial determination of probable cause within

6

the 48-hour time limit in which that is presumptively

7

reasonable under McLaughlin.
And so third I would submit it is not contested

8

9

that under McLaughlin if it is applied pursuant to

10

Griffith v. Kentucky, the Nevada Supreme Court erred in

11

failing to give Mr. Powell the benefit of that decision.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Pescetta, do I understand

3

correctly that if the Nevada Supreme Court had not on its

4

own brought up McLaughlin, it would not be in this case.

5

You would have forfeited it because the only thing that

6

was raised by Powell was arraignment and not probable

7

cause?
MR. PESCETTA:

8
9

I submit that we possibly could

have raised it in the context of an ineffective assistance

20

claim, imposed conviction, though that's not entirely

21

clear.

22

QUESTION:

But it wasn't in this case until the

23

Nevada Supreme Court put it there.

24

MR. PESCETTA:

25

Exactly, Your Honor, I agree.

acknowledge it was not raised.

We

The Nevada Supreme Court,

1

which does so periodically, reached out sua sponte and

2

drew this issue out of the case, and it decided it

3

correctly with respect to the substance but incorrectly

4

with respect to its retroactive effect.

5

QUESTION:

Wouldn't it be possible for the

6

Nevada Supreme Court to say on remand, sorry, we certainly

7

made a mistake; had we realized that McLaughlin had to be

8

retroactive, we never would have brought it up, and so now

9

we're deleting it?

10

MR. PESCETTA:

That would be a terribly

11

result-oriented result in the case, Your Honor, but I

12

submit that until the Nevada Supreme Court decides to do

13

that, that question is premature at this point.

14

conceivably raise a law of the case argument in the Nevada

15

Supreme Court since there is a very strong law of the case

16

doctrine in Nevada.

17

some way to wriggle off the McLaughlin hook, I think

18

that's a situation we would -- we should address if it, in

19

fact, does so.

20

We might

If the Nevada Supreme Court found

But they certainly have the power, and that has not

21

been contested by any party to this case, to reach out and

22

decide this Federal constitutional question.

23

done so, under Cohen v. Cowles Media and all of this

24

Court's precedents having reached the issue on the merits,

25

the jurisdiction is properly in this Court.

And having

I submit it's

1

for another day if the Nevada Supreme Court -- as are many

2

of these issues in this case, are for consideration

3

another day if the Nevada Supreme Court acts on remand in

4

a manner that denies petitioner relief.

5

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Pescetta, unless McLaughlin

6

carries with it an exclusionary rule, what difference is

7

it going to make in the judgment below, a conviction?
MR. PESCETTA:

8

9

Your Honor, it's our position

that the existence or nonexistence of a Federal

10

exclusionary remedy for a McLaughlin violation is

11

unnecessary to the disposition of this case because Nevada

12

has its own State law remedy, essentially a State law

13

McNabb-Mallory rule, which on remand, once it is -- once

14

it is required to properly apply McLaughlin to this case,

15

will kick in.

16

And that's why we've cited a number of --

QUESTION:

And you say that under Nevada State

17

law alone the statement would have to be excluded from

18

evidence?

19

MR. PESCETTA:

We submit that it would have to

20

be excluded under Federal and State law, because we submit

21

on the merits that there should be a Federal exclusionary

22

remedy.

23

to the disposition of the case because of the existence of

24

a State law remedy for that violation.

25

We submit that that issue also is not necessary

That's why we have cited Welsh v. Wisconsin and

1

other cases in our reply brief in which very similar

2

situations have arisen in which a Federal constitutional

3

violation implicates a State law remedy in which this

4

Court has not proceeded to the Federal exclusionary remedy

5

that would be required, if any, but remands for

6

consideration under the State law remedy.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Pescetta, I'm sure that is one of

8

our options, and I guess in my mind whether it's an option

9

we should take or not depends on the probability that

10

Nevada will decide the exclusionary issue in a way which

11

is, number one, dispositive of the case and, B, strictly

12

on State law grounds.

13

likelihood of decision on Federal grounds, then it seems

14

to me it might be prudent for us to go further here.

15

If there were a reasonable

Can you -- can you tell me categorically that in

16

fact Nevada's State law rule, as distinct from Nevada's

17

readiness to follow any Federal exclusionary rule, would

18

be, so far as you understand it, dispositive in this case?
MR. PESCETTA:

19

I believe so, Your Honor, and I

20

believe that the terms of the Nevada Supreme Court's

21

opinion --

22

QUESTION:

But you've just told me in answer to

23

the first question that the Nevada Supreme Court might,

24

you said, wriggle out of it.

25

with a question about arraignment under Nevada law, and

Or to say we started out

1

then we picked up McLaughlin on our own and made a mistake

2

in failing to understand that it is retroactive, and then

3

we returned and, in fact, our decision was about the

4

arraignment Nevada State law ground.

5

Couldn't this case go back and the Nevada

6

Supreme Court could say thank you for the instruction

7

about McLaughlin, we now understand that it's retroactive,

8

it was never raised by Powell, our decision on arraignment

9

stands just the way we wrote it?

Just take out those

10

paragraphs about McLaughlin and we've got a decision based

11

solely on State law.

12

MR. PESCETTA:

But, Your Honor, I don't think

13

this Court should pretermit that analysis by the Nevada

14

Supreme Court.

15

properly invested with jurisdiction over the Federal

16

question, which it is, this Court's responsibility is to

17

decide the Federal question.

18

I would submit that once this Court is

QUESTION:

Justice Souter asked you what could

19

the Nevada Supreme Court do on remand and would you

20

represent that, indeed, they would exclude this evidence.

21

You have already, I think, quite candidly said the Nevada

22

Supreme Court could nonetheless decide this case on the

23

State ground that they started and ended with, that is the

24

arraignment point.

25

MR. PESCETTA:

Your Honor, what I was suggesting

1

in answer to Justice O'Connor's question was that since

2

there is a State law remedy available for the Federal law

3

violation, that this Court need not proceed to delineate

4

the scope of the Federal exclusionary remedy.

5

that -- what I believed Justice Souter's question was was

6

that if this is remanded and if the Nevada Supreme Court

7

decides the McLaughlin issue on the merits, as I believe

8

it must, the availability of the State law remedy will

9

result in reversal.

I submit

That's our position.

10

Now if their -- if the Nevada Supreme -- I would

11

agree that the Nevada Supreme Court could do any number of

12

things.

13

different ground and never reach this issue.

14

question before this Court is whether having reached this

15

issue, they decided it correctly.

16

It could reverse on remand on an entirely

QUESTION:

But the

Well, the question, as you said in

17

the beginning, Mr. Pescetta, is narrow.

18

continue to discuss it, it's narrow indeed.

19

we would not ordinarily grant -- if it's as narrow as you

20

say -- an hour's argument on it.

21

Supreme Court of Nevada was wrong in deciding that

22

McLaughlin would not be given retroactive effect.

23

say we can't possibly go any further than that.

24
25

MR. PESCETTA:
Your Honor.

And as you

It's simply whether the

I'm not saying that you can't,

disposition of the case.

Court that in our petition for certiorari all we asked for

was for this judgment to be vacated and the case remanded

for proper consideration in light of Griffith.

actually more than we asked for.
QUESTION:

I'd just like to remind the

Well, maybe we think we need the full

(Laughter.)

11

QUESTION:

Let me -- may I just go back to the

12

Nevada law question?

13

that when relief can be granted as requested by a

14

prisoner, Nevada will always take up the State law issue

15

first?

16
17
18

Does Nevada have an announced rule

MR. PESCETTA:

I don't believe there is such a

rule.
QUESTION:

In other words what I'm getting at is

1

what is the probability that if we rule as narrowly as you

20

submit we should do, that in fact we will simply -- that

21

we will have done anything more than perhaps engage in a

22

summary reversal which will turn out to be of no

23

significance?

MR. PESCETTA:

I disagree, Your Honor.

which accept the prejudicial effect of the statement that

2

was elicited from the defendant as a result of this delay-

disposition of this issue.

5

reverses and remands for further proceedings in the Nevada

Supreme Court, that the Nevada Supreme Court will properly

apply its State law remedy which it has traditionally

8

adhered to, and it will reverse this case.

9

I submit that if this Court

And I don't -- you know, although it is

10

difficult for me to stand up for the Nevada Supreme Court,

11

until they do something that is unfair to us in that

12

regard, I submit --

13

QUESTION:

But would it be unfair to say that

14

this is a defense that you forfeited and therefore we're

15

going to make it clear that all we were trying to do was

16

to tell the troops in Nevada from now on you've got to

17

adhere to the 45 -- 48-hour standard?

18

passant in a case that was about arraignment.

19

MR. PESCETTA:

We said that en

I disagree Your Honor, first

20

because under this Court's consistent jurisprudence, most

21

recently Ylst v. Nunnemaker, a Federal law claim can be

22

forfeited all the way through a State system, and if it is

23

revived by being considered on the merits by the highest

24

court of the State, it's revived.

the State court is subject to review.
On the question of whether this was dealt with

2

3

en passant, I'd like to get to what I think is the thrust

4

of respondent's contention and really respondent's only

5

contention, which is that the Nevada Supreme Court did

not, in fact, decide the Fourth Amendment Question.

QUESTION:

Just before you get to that, just one
What concerns me, Mr. Pescetta, is

that this is a capital case.

Even if we assume that we

10

need not reach the Federal question, even if we intend to

11

remand it to the State to give the State a chance of

12

applying State law if it wishes, why shouldn't we

13

nonetheless resolve the Federal question just to prevent

14

this thing from ping-ponging back and forth forever?

15

It's obviously in your interest to have this

16

case decided in as piecemeal a fashion as possible.

17

is to say if the Federal issue is going to be decided, you

18

would -- because it might be decided against you, you'd

1

rather have it decided later.

completely as possible now by deciding the Federal issue

2

so just in case the Nevada court doesn't hold the way you

3

think it will on the State ground, we will spare you the

4

trouble of another appeal to this Court?

5

MR. PESCETTA:

Without being overly disingenuous

6

about it, Your Honor, I would say that ever since

7

Ashwander this Court has not decided Federal

8

constitutional questions just in case.

9

consistently adhered to the practice that if there is a

It has

10

State law remedy or if there is a Federal constitutional

11

question which is presented but which is not necessary to

12

the decision, that it will not reach that question.

13

Now, we are fairly confident, perhaps overly

14

confident, that our analysis of the Federal exclusionary

15

rule is accurate and that there should be a Federal

16

exclusionary remedy consistent with Justice Blackmun's

17

opinion in Brown v. Illinois.

18

have to focus on before this Court is obtaining relief for

19

my client, and as I see it, remanding this case to the

20

Nevada Supreme Court will result in that relief.

QUESTION:

But I think that what I

Although it's not in the question

22

presented, do you think that it's also necessary, even

23

under your minimum suggested approach, that we reach the

question of whether the Nevada Supreme Court was correct

in saying that a right to seasonable arraignment is waived

when you waive your Miranda rights?

MR. PESCETTA:

QUESTION:

MR. PESCETTA:

I submit that --

Or was that a matter of State law?
I submit, Your Honor, that that

is correctly not within the question presented.

additionally submit that that is also a question of State

7

law which this Court need not reach.

8

the Nevada Supreme Court's decision -QUESTION:

Cannot reach.

But I

And their decision,

If it's a pure

10

question of State law, which Nevada seems to have treated

11

it.

12

it, as a question of State law, it was resolved as a

13

question of State law, then this Court has no business

14

with it.

The arraignment question was raised, as I understand

15

MR. PESCETTA:

16

QUESTION:

17

I agree, Your Honor.

As I was --

But do you -- is it clear to you that

it's a question of State law --

MR. PESCETTA:

QUESTION:

20

MR. PESCETTA:

I believe with respect --

--As the Nevada court treated it?
I submit with respect to the

21

22

that is a question of State law.

24

Court in resolving the question of waiver referred

25

explicitly to the defendant's waiver of, quote, his right

And if you look at page

1

to an appearance before a magistrate within 72 hours,

2

which is the State law ground, the State statute which it

3

had just found unconstitutional on McLaughlin grounds,

4

makes it absolutely clear that that waiver point was

5

decided purely as a question of State law and does not

6

impact the disposition of the Fourth Amendment.

7

QUESTION:

And we'll just footnote the fact that

8

I don't understand how a State law waiver controls the

9

existence of a Federal law.

10

MR. PESCETTA:

My point exactly, Your Honor.

11

If, as the State urges, that there has been a waiver, our

12

response to that is Your Honor's response to that; there

3

has been no waiver of the Federal constitutional right.

4

And the discussion of the waiver issue in the Nevada

5

Supreme Court's opinion is directed entirely at the State

6

statutory right because having found the McLaughlin

7

violation, the Nevada Supreme Court then tripped in this

8

footnote and said, but we are not going to apply it to

9

petitioner's case.

20
21

And I would just like to repeat for

emphasis, we cite -QUESTION:

But just to make sure I understand it

22

correctly, everything that they said about waiver because

23

of the Miranda warnings, that all tied into the

24

arraignment State ground and they were not dealing with

25

any Federal right anymore because they thought incorrectly

1

that McLaughlin wasn't retroactive.
MR. PESCETTA:

2

Absolutely, Your Honor.

That

3

portion of the opinion deals solely with the arraignment

4

and first appearance statute, not with the Fourth

5

Amendment ground.

6

recognizes, the Nevada Supreme Court, having found the

7

Fourth Amendment violation, then did not apply that rule

8

to petitioner's case despite the fact that it was before

9

it on direct appeal.
QUESTION:

10

Because, as I think the Court

Now -So this is an opinion that starts

11

with State law arraignment, shifts to Federal probable

12

cause, says Federal probable cause is not retroactive,

13

goes back to arraignment and continues down the line with

14

State law?

15

MR. PESCETTA:

Yes, Your Honor.

I agree that

16

there are shards sticking up in various places on

17

different issues, but what they get to and what I submit

18

renders the respondent's argument completely indefensible

19

is the language that appears on page 6 of the joint

20

appendix when they finally get to the McLaughlin issue and

21

they say, quote, the McLaughlin case renders NRS 171.1783

22

unconstitutional.

23

that a suspect must come before a magistrate within 48

24

hours, including nonjudicial days, for a probable cause

25

determination.

Based on McLaughlin we hold --we hold

Now, we've cited a number of cases in our brief

2

on independent and adequate State grounds, and I submit

10

QUESTION:

Delay is delay, as I see it.

We -- of course this Court has

11

followed a McNabb-Mallory type of rule, and yet surely

12

it's an open question here whether an exclusionary rule

13

accompanies the violation of the McLaughlin rule.

14

wouldn't the Nevada court take the same position; yes, in

15

Huebner we have a McNabb-Mallory rule, but that doesn't

necessarily answer the question as to the remedy for a

17

violation of the 48-hour arraignment right?

18

MR. PESCETTA:

Why

I submit that the terms of those

19

previous decisions do indicate that a delay, which is

20

concededly -- concededly does not invoke a Federal

21

exclusionary rule under McNabb-Mallory because

22

McNabb-Mallory is not a Federal constitutional rule,

23

nonetheless results in inadmissability.

Now, to turn briefly to the question of the

Federal exclusionary rule, I submit that this is purely a

4

rule that would follow all of the principles enunciated by

5

numerous decisions in this Court, that the purpose of an

exclusionary rule is to deter the wrongful conduct.

we have a situation where it is within the power of the

granted because of the posture in which this case comes to

this Court, the record is not pellucid on many issues.

That is why we submit that this case has to go back to the

15

Now,

In fact, many of the respondent's arguments,

reversing this judgment and not for affirming it.

elsewhere in its opinion that the probable cause

No, not to my recollection, and

that is what I think befuddles some of us.

talking about it as though it applied to the statutory

MR. SEATON:

That could not happen.
It does not happen.

It could

It seems to me that what the Nevada

happen in the future, that he must -- the defendant must

be present at the probable cause determination in less

20

than 48 hours, even though he doesn't have to be arraigned

MR. SEATON:

That's correct.

With the very short remaining time that I have left,
10

I would simply like to go on past these aspects of the

11

case and suggest to the Court that are -- there are two

12

reasons, which have been fairly fully briefed in our

13

briefs, why the exclusionary rule in this particular case,

14

or cases like it, should not occur.

15

And one of them clearly is that in this

16

particular case the statement, the confession, if you

17

will, of the defendant, was clearly not the fruit of the

18

delay in the finding of probable cause that occurred in

1

this particular case.

should not work.

MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I would like to start by answering the question

that was posed at the outset concerning the possibility of

24

State remedies, and by saying that there is no reason to

25

think in this case that there is any State remedy.

In

1

Powell's view, the State court in this case, A, found that

2

the Fourth Amendment was blatantly violated but, B,

3

refused to give a Federal remedy based on what everyone

4

now says is a wrong view of Federal retroactivity rule --

5

rules.

6

If there were indeed -- if there were indeed a

7

separate and independent State remedy, the Supreme Court

8

of Nevada, by hypothesis having found that the Fourth
Amendment was violated, surely would have granted it.

And

10

indeed it is a little bit strange that the principle

11

authority cited for the claim that there is an independent

12

State remedy in this court is the opinion of the Supreme

13

Court of Nevada in this case which, if it stands for

14

anything, is that there is no State remedy for --

15

QUESTION:

Well, why would it give a State

16

remedy for a statute which it found was inapplicable

17

because of its misunderstanding of retroactivity?

18

MR. ESTRADA:

It did not -- there are two

1

different issues, Justice Souter. The Supreme Court of

20

Nevada stated in its opinion that there is a remedy, much

21

like the McNabb-Mallory remedy, for the violation of its

22

statute.

23

that right is waiveable.

statements have anything to do with the error of Federal

law that the court made, which is to say that as a matter

of Federal law there is no Federal remedy available in

2

this case.

3

If we concede the premise for this Court's

4

having jurisdiction, which is the claim that the Supreme

5

Court of Nevada necessarily found a Fourth Amendment

6

violation in this case, then it must follow that there can

7

be no independent State remedy for that since if there

8

were, the court surely would have given it.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Estrada, I don't follow that line

10

of reasoning, because I thought the Nevada Supreme Court

11

was saying there was a violation of a Federal

12

constitutional right, but it's not retroactive, and are we

13

glad it isn't retroactive because if it were we would have

14

to release this man from incarceration totally, not simply

15

exclude the statement.

16

MR. ESTRADA:

What they said was it is not

17

retroactive as a matter of Federal law, Justice Ginsburg,

18

which if -- which is a statement --

19

QUESTION:

So why should it be retroactive as a

20

matter of State law, but they -- wouldn't they think that

the State law, at least in that respect, would be the same

as the Federal?

Estrada, correct me if you

MR. ESTRADA:

11

The court did find by hypothesis a

violation of the Fourth Amendment.

Federal remedy based on an error of Federal law, but that

14

didn't keep the State from granting a State remedy if

15

there were one.

16

remedy that there is is a McNabb-Mallory remedy, which the

court stated is tailored to Fifth Amendment interests and

which, as a matter of State law, is waiveable.

The problem with the argument is that the

MR. ESTRADA:

Well,

I -- we don't read the --

3

what the court said as indicating that the court felt

compelled to deny a State remedy based on Federal law.

And unless the court can be read to have said so, the

judgment it rendered in this very case is evidence for the

view that there is no independent State remedy, and

QUESTION:

Mr. Estrada, excuse me for

10

interrupting, but I -- maybe I'm not following you, but

11

you're saying that the court said there was a violation of

the Fourth Amendment.

And you mean the McLaughlin rule.

13

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes.

But they say it is important to note

15

that the 48-hour requirement mandated in McLaughlin does

they mistakenly thought it was not retroactive.

Those are the

very words the court used, it does not apply to the case
at hand.

Now why do you say that a rule that doesn't

apply was found to have been violated?
MR. ESTRADA:

Well, I was taking not our

statement of what they did, but their statement as to why
this Court has jurisdiction, which is that the highest
State court chose to notice a plain error and to waive a
bar.

If the State court didn't do that, then there is a

bar to this Court's jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

If we take their --

But that Federal rule that they

misapplied is not McLaughlin, it's Griffith.

Well, the State has made an

I understand they've made arguments.
-- The opposite effect.

But you don't subscribe to those

arguments, do you?

10

MR. ESTRADA:

We have not subscribed one way or

11

the other to any view, and we're happy to go forward on

12

the view that the Court does have jurisdiction.

13

saying is that from what the court did in this case, there

14

is nothing that would lead one to think that there is an

15

independent State remedy, because the court stated the

16

State rule as being one designed to protect the Fifth

Amendment right and one, in that light, which is waiveable

under State law, and it found it waived.

nothing wrong with the judgment as a matter of Federal

law, and we say there is not despite the error in the

3

statement, then the judgment should not be overturned.

4

In our view, there is nothing wrong with the

5

judgment as a matter of Federal law because, as a matter

6

of Federal law, the statement is not a fruit of the timing

7

violation on which the petitioner relies, and the good

faith exception would apply to bar suppression even if the

statement is deemed a fruit in the circumstances of this

case.

QUESTION:

But all that assumes that Hawaii --

12

that Nevada will not apply its Huebner rule to a

Harris and Motalvo, we think that it is reasonably clear

2

that as a matter of Federal law there is no Federal remedy

3

if there's --

QUESTION:

But wouldn't it be -- wouldn't it

5

have been appropriate for the -- to -- instead of asking

6

the Court to decide what is a fairly weighty question,

7

what are the consequences of a McLaughlin violation, to

8

say this is a very poor case in which to make any such

9

decision; there are two paragraphs thrown into an opinion

10

that's all about State law.

11

to make a significant decision in a case where this issue

12

just crept into the case, was in and out before anybody

13

could notice it?

14

MR. ESTRADA:

Why are you urging the Court

Because we also --we only learned

15

of the existence of the case after the case had been

16

granted, which we take to be an indication that the Court

17

is interested in dealing with the Federal issues that

18

there may be in the case.

19

assumption, we thought that we would come into the case

20

and give the Court our views as to the Federal issues,

21

which are as we have stated in our brief.

And in light of that

22

And I thank the Court.

23

QUESTION:

24

Mr. Pescetta, you have 2 minutes remaining.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

2
3

MR. PESCETTA:

I will try to talk fast, Your

Honor.

4

The answer to Justice Ginsburg's question about

5

what happens if the Nevada Supreme Court says we are not

6

going to decide this issue, is that would then not be an

7

adequate State ground for the decision.

8

the Nevada Supreme Court adopts a procedural bar rule that

9

says we will forgive procedural bars so long as we don't

We submit that if

10

have to reverse, but we will invoke procedural bars so

11

long as we can affirm, that's not an independent and

12

adequate State ground.

13

answer to your concern about what happens if the case goes

14

back.

15
16

And that I submit is the short

I submit that the McLaughlin violation, contrary
to what counsel said, means --

17

QUESTION:

In other words, are you arguing that

18

the Nevada Supreme Court is estopped?

19

raise this issue.

20

saying that now having raised it, the court is estopped

21

from withdrawing it?

22

Powell didn't

The court did on it's own.

MR. PESCETTA:

And you're

Then we have to litigate the

23

procedural bar issue in the Nevada Supreme Court, and

24

ultimately in this Court, but that's not ripe for decision

25

today.

1

QUESTION:

Why would that be a Federal question?

2

MR. PESCETTA:

Because the adequacy of a State

y

3

procedural bar is always a question of Federal law, to bar

4

review of a Federal constitutional issue.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. PESCETTA:

7

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

It

reviewed the issue; that's the end of the question.

8
9

Which the court itself injected.

Now, as to good faith, the State is relying on
the statute which it says has nothing to do with the

10

probable cause determination, the first appearance

11

statute, to say they could, in good faith, rely on that in

12

allowing the 72 hour time limit.

13

anomalous to say on the one hand it has nothing to do with

14

the probable cause determination, but on the other hand

15

that's the good faith reliance on the statute that invokes

16

Illinois v. Krull.

17

I submit that's entirely

With respect to Harris and the illegality of

18

custody, illegal custody under McLaughlin is illegal

19

custody.

20

The difference between Harris is the manner of arresting

21

him was the constitutional violation; the custody was

22

legal.

23

the custody became illegal.

24

custody, under the Fourth Amendment, at that point.

25

He shouldn't be in custody because it's illegal.

Here, once the McLaughlin time limit was passed,
He should not have been in

I thank the Court.
