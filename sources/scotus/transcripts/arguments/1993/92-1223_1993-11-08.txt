ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. WRIGHT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. WRIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether Federal

12

agencies must disclose the home addresses of Federal

13

employees to unions.

14

Federal labor relations statute provides that, to the

15

extent not prohibited by law, unions are entitled to

16

information that's necessary for collective bargaining.

17

Three statutes are involved.

The

The parties agree that "to the extent not

18

prohibited by law" references the Privacy Act, and the

19

parties further agree that in the absence of an applicable

20

exception to the Privacy Act, the home addresses are not

21

discloseable.

22

exception to the Privacy Act authorizes the disclosure of

23

home addresses.

So the legal issue here is whether an

24

The parties further agree that the only arguably

25

relevant exception here is exception (b)(2) to the Privacy

1

Act.

That exception says that information that has to be

2

disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act may be

3

disclosed under the Privacy Act.

4

agree that when analyzed under FOIA, the question is

5

whether FOIA Exemption 6 applies.

6

information should not be disclosed when that would

7

constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal

8

privacy.

And the parties also

It states that

Now, at this point the agreement between the

10

parties ceases.

takes the position that home addresses must be disclosed

12

to unions.

13

its contention that in deciding what gets weighed under

14

FOIA Exemption 6, that collective bargaining interests get

15

weighed in that FOIA balance.

16

The Federal Labor Relations Authority

Critical to its conclusion in that regard is

We disagree.

We agree with the D.C. Circuit,

17

which analyzed this case and said that all that gets

18

weighed on the FOIA side of the balance is the interest in

19

disclosing what the Government's up to.

20

the D.C. Circuit that it would, in fact, require an

21

imaginative reconstruction of the statutes at issue to

22

read them the way the FLRA has read them.

23

QUESTION:

And we agree with

And yet it's true that every circuit

24

so construed this complex of statutes until this Court's

25

decision in Reporters Committee, is that not right?

MR. WRIGHT:

1

That's correct, Your Honor, and the

2

Fifth Circuit noted that in its decision in this case.

3

would say that really what that shows is that prior to

4

this Court's decision in Reporters Committee, a handful of

5

courts of appeals had misconstrued FOIA.

6

courts had concluded that collective bargaining

7

agreements -- or, excuse me, collective bargaining

8

interests could be weighed on the FOIA side of the

9

balance.
QUESTION:

10

I

Each of those

It was -- it was more than collective

11

bargaining interests in itself.

12

MR. WRIGHT:

It was another statute.

That's correct.

Those courts had

13

held that the interests that can be weighed on the FOIA

14

side of the balance are not limited to those interests

15

that tell you what the Government's up to or that open the

16

light of agency action to public scrutiny, the interests

17

that this Court identified in Reporters Committee as the

18

sole --as the sole interest that may be weighed on the

19

FOIA side of the balance.
QUESTION:

20

So do I take it that your position is

21

that the labor management relations statute counts for

22

nothing?

24

any member of the public, that we should regard this

25

situation precisely the same way.

It seems that it's no different, in your

it's a union making the request.

2

the request emanates initially from the labor management

relations statute.

Is that correct?

MR. WRIGHT:

It doesn't matter that

That's how we read the -- that's

5

how we read the statutes.

The Federal -- the case starts

6

with the Federal labor relations statute.

7

the Privacy Act.

8

there, home addresses would not be discloseable.

9

arguable exception is this FOIA exception, and once placed

10

wholly within FOIA's domain, in our view, the union stands

11

in no different position than any member of the general

12

public.

It references

We all agree that if the case ended
The only

And the further point follows that if -- if, in

13

fact, home addresses are discloseable to unions, then

15

under Reporters Committee they're discloseable to

16

everyone, thus magnifying --

Why does that -- why does that

follow?

it's because the weighing process is giving effect to

But in Reporters Committee there was

no other Federal statute that came into play, was there?
MR. WRIGHT:

6

Well, Your Honor, in Reporters

7

Committee the Court -- the Court emphasized that there's a

8

very strong public interest in learning about anyone's

9

criminal history.

Rap sheets were an issue there.

QUESTION:

10

There was nothing comparable to

11

the -- that was a straight FOIA request by the Reporters

12

Committee.

13

FOIA, but under the labor management relations statute.

14

And that's -- the presence of another statute was not a

15

factor in Reporters Committee.

16

MR. WRIGHT:

Here we have a request that is made not under

Let me - - let me make two responses

17

there.

18

the way the statutes read with the Federal labor relations

19

statute and the Privacy Act interaction, then passing it

20

wholly off to the FOIA area, we don't think the fact that

21

another statute could be referenced makes a difference.

22

First -- first, of course, you're correct.

But

But as I was saying, there is a legitimate

23

public interest in identifying -- in learning about

24

people's criminal histories.

1

various other sorts of statutes as showing that there's a

2

public interest that's on the books, that shows that

3

there's interest in finding out whether people are

4

convicted felons or not.
QUESTION:

5

I took it to be one of the bases of

6

our decision in Reporters Committee that the personnel at

7

agencies who have to deal with FOIA requests cannot be

8

expected to inquire into the individuated needs of each

9

requester.

10

And so you have to decide it on an in gross

basis, should the public at large.
Now, assuming -- assuming that that's correct,

11
12

would it make an enormous exception from that to say,

13

well, we won't consider the individuated needs of the

14

public at large, but we will consider policies that are

15

set forth in Federal statutes.

16

exception would that be to the policy we were trying to

17

further in Reporters Committee?

18

MR. WRIGHT:

How much of a big

Well, I -- the U.S. Code is pretty

19

big these days.

20

with statutes that arguably supported their position.

21

mean, obviously what the -- the exception the union's

22

trying to create here is somewhat narrower, certainly,

23

than - -

I assume lots of people could come up

called into play, for example?

QUESTION:

MR. WRIGHT:

If some
Are there many?

I haven't --

If someone made a FOIA request, I'm

4

sure they could -- since the Federal Government is

5

involved in so many things these days, I'm sure that they

6

could -- they could -- people could make claims.

certainly willing to concede that it would be a narrower

exception.

important infringement of privacy interests, as all -- as

10

all concede, even if -- even if the union, the collective

11

bargaining area were the only exception that would be

12

open.

It would still be - - there would still be

QUESTION:

13

But I'm

Well, I suppose that the -- that the

14

inconvenience or the impracticality for the -- for the

15

FOIA processor is not simply the number of statutes, but

16

rather the necessity of figuring out who the requestor is.

17

MR. WRIGHT:

18

QUESTION:

Well that -Even if there are only a few

19

statutes, you would add to the FOIA process the necessity

20

of determining that this is, indeed, a labor union or a

21

labor union officer, or whatever other individual is the

22

beneficiary of one particular Federal statute or another,

23

whereas currently you don't have to know who the requestor

24

is.

25

It doesn't matter what his name is, right?
MR. WRIGHT:

Well, you know, we look at this as

a Privacy Act case.

I mean, our focus isn't so much on

2

people in agencies who are trying to process FOIA

3

requests.

4

agree protects this sort of information in the absence of

5

an applicable exception, and we don't see one.

Our focus is on the Privacy Act, which all

There are -- there are, in fact, 12 exceptions

6

7

to the Privacy Act.

Not one of them mentions collective

8

bargaining interest.

And in our view, what the FLRA is

9

trying to do is write a thirteenth exception.

The

10

exception that they're arguing for talks about FOIA, and

11

in Reporters Committee this Court went on at some length,

12

correctly concluding that Congress did not intend to turn

13

the Federal Government into a clearing house for personal

14

information.

the light of public scrutiny.

It -- it intended to open agency action to

16

And it's conceded here -- the Fifth Circuit

17

ruled against us here, but the Fifth Circuit candidly

18

acknowledged that if -- if what gets weighed on the

19

disclosure side of the FOIA balance here is what this

20

information tells about what the Government's doing, we

21

win.

22

QUESTION:

I don't find it very appealing as a

23

Privacy Act case, to tell you the truth, Mr. Wright.

24

you know -- I've been talking about it as a FOIA case only

25

because the Privacy Act exception refers you to FOIA.

I,

And

1

so thereafter you analyze it like a FOIA case.

2

it's -- if you're just appealing to privacy interests,

3

find it really very strange that the Federal Government

4

should not allow to be obtained from Federal employees

5

what it requires to be provided from non-Federal

6

employees.

7
8

I mean,

But if
I

if anything, you would think that

Federal employees would be - - certainly in other areas
Federal employees have less privacy than private citizens,

10

and you're telling us that we have a statute here which

11

gives more privacy to Federal employees than to private

12

citizens, because a private citizen, his address is

13

obtainable by a labor union.

14

MR. WRIGHT:

Well,

if I can make both a legal

15

and an equitable argument to that point.

16

argument is that the Privacy Act applies here and it

17

doesn't apply in the private sector, and that seems to us

18

to be a very important difference and indicates that

1

Federal employees have privacy rights that private

20

employees don't.

21

The legal

Turning to the equitable point, I think that

22

there are some very important differences between the

23

private sector and the Federal sector, and the chief of

24

which is that it's clear that Federal unions can arrange

25

to get adequate contact with employees at the workplace.

1

One key difference is that there's a Federal Service

2

Impasses Panel that can impose proposals on agency

3

management over their objection.

4

So if unions want more contact with employees at

5

work -- and there's no real issue here that unions have

6

plenty of - - Federal unions have plenty of contact at

7

work.

8

certainly get enough contact to ask the employees for

9

their home address.

10

They can -- they can get more contact.

They can

I mean, as a practical matter, what's at issue

11

here is whether we're going to override the choices of

12

Federal employees who have not made their home addresses

13

available to unions, and hold that those home addresses

14

have to be disclosed anyway, even though the employees

15

don't want their home addresses disclosed.

16

in the Riverside case where there were -- there were 34

17

members of the bargaining unit.

18

want their home addresses disclosed to the union; the FLRA

19

disclosed them anyway.

20

QUESTION:

That happened

22 said that they didn't

On your -- on your first argument,

21

the Privacy Act applies to the public sector and not the

22

private sector, but the -- the union, it applies to the

23

public sector, but in the interests of private people as

24

well as public employees, right, the Privacy Act?

25

MR. WRIGHT:

That's true.

1

QUESTION:

So it's, as far as the employee is

2

concerned, a little hard to distinguish the situation of

3

the employee.

4

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, Federal employees are

5

protected by the Privacy Act and private employees, as

6

employees, are not.

7

QUESTION:

You know, we think that's -Because they happen to work for a

8

Federal agency, not because there's something about their

9

employee status that would require - - that indicates a

10
11

congressional policy to give them greater protection.
MR. WRIGHT:

Well, the -- the Privacy Act

12

applies in the -- to Federal employees.

13

we think that that indicates a congressional policy.

14

QUESTION:

I mean, you know,

And so does the labor management

information --at least that's a given in this case, isn't

17

it, that were it not for the reference to the Privacy Act,

that this information would be relevant to the collective

right about that, but that's the point at which deference

And, of course, that's assuming that you can

MR. SMITH:

3

We get around it by remembering

where this case emanates.

This case is first and foremost

5

a Federal sector labor relations case.

6

the world can make a request for information under the

7

Federal sector labor relations statute.

8

that request, the statute admittedly does direct you to

whether or not the information is prohibited by law.

must at all times keep in mind that the request emanated

14

under the Federal sector labor relations statute.
QUESTION:

15

Well, why is that so, Mr. Smith?

You

I

16

presume that almost every sort of request for information

17

to which the privacy applies -- Privacy Act applies comes

18

under some other statute or some other interest.

19

should this particular source be more important than other

20

sources?

21

MR. SMITH:

Why

Several reasons, Mr. Chief Justice.

22

To begin with, research has revealed no other statute

23

comparable to the Federal sector labor relations statute

24

which directs you through the Privacy Act to the Freedom

25

of Information Act.

Secondly, within the four corners of the Federal

Well, you can bargain collectively

who don't want to give their names to the union.

12

MR. SMITH:

We take exception to the notion --

13

and, indeed, there's no evidence in the record to support

14

the conclusion that the only addresses that the Federal

15

sector unions do not have are those of employees who have

16

chosen not to provide them.

of reasons why a Federal sector union might not have the

name and address of a Federal sector employee.

might not yet have provided their name to the union.

except the Privacy Act has to be complied with.

And the

2

Privacy Act says there's an exception for anything that

3

has to be disclosed under FOIA.
So it is a Federal case, labor relations case,

4
5

but the issue is what has Congress provided for in this

6

area.

7

they've provided that Federal employees have a privacy

8

interest except to the extent there's an exception from

FOIA, because of FOIA.

And if you -- if you walk that progression through,

MR. SMITH:

10

Justice Scalia, we agree that

11

Federal employees have a privacy interest.

that Federal employees would be able to prevent

does not lead inescapably to the conclusion that you

the Federal Labor Relations Act, as this Court found in

Mr. Smith, isn't the difference, and

what makes this a hard case, is under the Freedom of

But you're kind of claiming here that since

your -- since your original request is not made under

union uniquely can have access to this information.

12

the weighing -- the public interest to be weighed is the

13

union's special interest in collective bargaining, so that

14

you could screen out other requesters if you can attribute

this collective bargaining purpose as something to be

Mr. Smith, you had said earlier, I

that the courts had not been giving it to you under FOIA.

They had - - they had denied your - - the requests under

So when you properly balance collective

Excuse me.

Also,

I'm talking about routine

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

With respect -You're quite right.

You have an

uphill battle to get it declared a routine-use of

15

employees' addresses that they be given out.

16

far as prosecuting grievances is concerned, you could not

have it declared a routine-use of personnel information to

give it to a union prosecuting a grievance?

19

MR. SMITH:

But just as

It already has been declared a

However, it is up to the agency of

of determining what it is the unions get.
I would point out that there is already a

routine-use which authorizes the release of names and home

addresses to Federal sector collective bargaining units.

However, as with the wording in the other routine-use,

it's up to the agencies of Government to determine whether

You're just saying you don't get it if the

So you can get it whenever

4

Admittedly, that's a bit broader than a

agencies have used the routine-use to deny information to

And Mr. Smith went on at some length about how it can be

2

difficult to get a hold of new employees' addresses.

3

Let me make clear that there are many collective

4

bargaining agreements that require management four times a

5

year, for example, to provide to the union a list of the

6

names and worksite mailing addresses of all employees in

7

the unit, highlighting those hired during the prior

quarter.

and work addresses of Federal employees, and it's done all

QUESTION:

Well, I understand that.

I'm just --

I'm just trying to think through whether even assuming

it's wholly within FOIA's domain and even assuming the

6

one hand and "could reasonably be expected to constitute

MR. WRIGHT:

It's the difference between

identity of the requester goes hand in hand with the

purpose for which the requester wants the information.

So this is just as though it was an

Yeah.

Is the -- is the result going to be

Would you agree that they're

In addition, you can make an argument that --

that some of the information unions request tells you

There -- there are two arguments being made
One is that the statute does
That it -- it

And the other argument is that even under FOIA, they --

yes, we owe them deference but this goes beyond the scope

MR. WRIGHT:

That -- well, they get

deference under -- under section 7114 of the federal labor

relations statute, but that leads you right to the Privacy

Act.

Act, which is what directs you to FOIA, or under FOIA.
