ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. OLIVER KOPPELL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

GENERAL KOPPELL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case is of enormous importance to the State

12

of New York, indeed, to other States, and also to people

13

in private business.

14

court of appeals which found our system for taxing

15

cigarette sales by Indian traders to non-Indians preempted

16

by Federal law.

17

ask this Court to protect our State's fisc by reversing

18

the determination of our court of appeals.

19

Court's prior decision in Moe, Colville, and Potawatomi,

20

sustained the State system as consistent with Federal law,

21

and that is what the court of appeals said was not so.

I urge this Court to reverse our own

It is indeed somewhat ironic that I must

However, this

22

Indeed, when this Court remanded this very case

23

to our State courts 2 years ago, I believe that it did so

24

because you recognized that States may require both retail

25

and wholesale Indian traders to assist in collecting taxes

due on sales to non-Indians at reservation stores.
QUESTION:

2

General Koppell, may I ask you if

3

this case was litigated below at all on the notion that

4

the New York statute is severable, that there are a

5

variety of provisions in it, and that some of them should

6

survive even if others do not?

7
8

GENERAL KOPPELL:

Your Honor, the case before us

narrowly focuses on the regulation of wholesalers, and not
retailers, and what we are looking here is merely those

10

aspects of the regulation that regulate the sale, or sales

11

by wholesalers.

12

they are very limited, and the Court should look at the

13

regulatory scheme only as it affects the respondents here,

14

who are cigarette wholesalers.

15

QUESTION:

16

In my opinion, those are very narrow,

And is the statute severable, in your

view?

17

GENERAL KOPPELL:

Yes, I think it's severable.

18

I think the Court could indeed uphold even portions of the

1

regulations on wholesalers and not others, and certainly

20

this Court should only deal with wholesalers.
The Solicitor General brings into his brief

21

22

before this Court the way the regulations affect the

23

retailers.

record with respect to how the regulations affect

That's really not before this Court.

It was

There's really no evidence in the

1

retailers.
With respect to wholesalers, again,

2

I think this

3

Court could sever and find some of the regulations

4

applicable, but I do want to emphasize that the

5

regulations on the cigarette wholesalers are quite

6

limited, and really only require a limited amount of

7

record-keeping and in fact are quite consistent with the

8

regulation of Indian traders that has been upheld by this

9

Court in the Moe case and in the Colville.
QUESTION:

Does the provision requiring

licensing of --

QUESTION:

GENERAL KOPPELL:

Of the wholesalers?

-- the wholesaler,

is that before us?

The wholesalers only have to

there were a wholesaler -- and in fact Elias Attea, who is

one of the respondents here,

to Indians, and not to non-Indians, and that he would only

20

meet Indian demand on the reservation, he would not have

21

to be licensed.

sells only on Indian

If he contended that he wanted to sell only

However, we believe that virtually all Indian

22

23

stores sell both to Indians and to non-Indians.

To the

24

extent that cigarettes go from the wholesalers to non-

25

Indians,

they would have to be licensed, as are all

QUESTION:

GENERAL KOPPELL:

No --

They would not?
That is not so, Your Honor.

8

They would have to register under the system that the

State established --

GENERAL KOPPELL:

there is no fee.

GENERAL KOPPELL:

QUESTION:

Mr. Koppell.
Yes.

Let me ask you the same question, I

23

think perhaps, or get to the same point that Justice

24

O'Connor has in mind.

Can we decide this case strictly on the question

1

of whether there is an impermissible limitation on

2

quantities that may be sold, or is it impossible to

3

determine -- to resolve that issue without getting into

4

questions of registration, licensing, and so on?

5

GENERAL KOPPELL:

Well, the -- as I indicated

6

earlier, the question of registration is really not before

7

this Court, shouldn't be before this Court.

8

General --

9

QUESTION:

Well, then your answer is no.

10

GENERAL KOPPELL:

11

QUESTION:

12

The Solicitor

No, my answer is yes.

We can decide it strictly on the

issue of quantity.

13

GENERAL KOPPELL:

You can decide -- you can

14

decide the -- you can decide that issue.

15

whether it is in fact permissible to limit the quantity of

16

nontaxable cigarettes.

17

QUESTION:

18

GENERAL KOPPELL:

19

22

And that's all we have to decide.
No, I think there is more for

you to decide.
QUESTION:

20
21

You can decide

What is the more that we have to

reach?
GENERAL KOPPELL:

I think you also have to reach

23

the issue of whether the record-keeping requirements can

24

be imposed on the wholesalers, the limited record-keeping

25

requirements.

1

QUESTION:

Okay.

2

GENERAL KOPPELL:

As I indicated before, if I

3

may, the court of appeals makes two basic mistakes in its

4

reading of this Court's teachings in the Moe and Colville

5

and Potawatomi cases, two basic flaws which are

6

fundamental to the court of appeals decision which is

7

before Your Honors.
If you look at A12 in the appendix to our

8

9

petition, I will read from there, and they say the

10

following.

11

Supreme Court approved the imposition of precollection and

12

record-keeping requirements on Indian retailers in those

13

cases, the State can lawfully impose them on wholesalers,

14

who are just one step further back on the distribution

15

chain.

16

They say -- they contend that inasmuch as the

Moe and Colville involved burdens placed on

17

Indian retailers dealing with non-Indians rather than on

18

wholesalers dealing with Indians, a significant

19

difference, and that is the major difference why they hold

20

that in fact the regulations here are impermissible with

21

respect to the respondents, the wholesalers, but there is

22

no distinction.

23

They make a distinction between retailers and

24

wholesalers for purposes of the Indian Traders Act, but if

25

you go to the Indian Traders Act, you see that that is not

2

a distinction made.
Now, it is clear in Colville, for instance, that

3

in fact the Indian retailers in that case were, in fact,

4

Indian traders under the Federal law.

5

same category as the wholesalers here.

6

They were in the

This distinction the court of appeals makes that

7

you can, in fact, burden retailers but you cannot burden

8

wholesalers, otherwise you are preempted by the Federal

9

law, that distinction is not found in the Federal law and

10

should not be made.

11

have record-keeping requirements for the retailers, you

12

can have those very same record-keeping requirements on

13

the wholesalers.

14

If you can regulate the retailers and

The distinction they make is simply not found in

15

Federal law, and it is nowhere found in the precedents of

16

this Court, and again, I would suggest that the reason

17

that this Court sent the case back to New York suggesting

18

that the court look at Potawatomi, is that this Court

19

recognized that that distinction between retailers and

20

wholesalers really makes no sense.

21

Federal law.

We are talking about --

2

GENERAL KOPPELL:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- and that there were then some

4

provisions for refunds of taxes paid by Indian consumers,

5

would that statute pass muster under this court's -- this

6

lower court's opinion?

7

GENERAL KOPPELL:

I think that a system that

8

required precollection of all taxes and then refund might

9

well not pass muster, but this is not the system here.
What is attempted to be done by the system is

10

11

very simple:

12

cigarettes which are required on the reservation and then

13

allocate those, and then say the remainder of the

14

inventory has to be taxable, so that with respect to the

15

Indian sales, the sales to Indians on the reservation, no

16

tax is precollected, there's no requirement of

17

precollection of the tax and request for refund.

18

to estimate the number of tax-free

QUESTION:

But why isn't the estimation of the

19

quantity in advance -- why isn't that in conflict with the

20

Federal statute that says it's the Federal authority and

21

not the State that is to specify the kind and quality of

22

goods?

23

GENERAL KOPPELL:

That -- I'm -- thank -- it is

24

not the same, Your Honor, and I'm glad you asked the

25

question, because that's the second flaw in the court of

2

appeals' argument.
The fact of the matter is that we are not

3

regulating the number of cigarettes.

4

send as many cigarettes -- the wholesalers can send as

5

many cigarettes as they want onto the reservation.

6

Indian retailers can sell as many cigarettes as they want.

7

In no way.

You can

The

All we are saying is that with respect to

8

untaxed cigarettes, that there, no precollection.

We are

9

limiting the number of those to the legitimate demand of

10

the Indians on the reservation, and if that demand

11

changes, the allocation will be increased by the tax

12

department.

13

in a vacuum.

14

It's not a fixed number, and it's not created

First of all, the regulations specifically talk

15

about an agreement between the tribes and the State with

16

respect to the number of tax-free cigarettes that will be

17

required on the reservation.

18

agreement does the State come in and make an estimate of

19

the number of tax-free cigarettes that are required to

20

meet legitimate Indian demand, so that the system has

21

integrity and is flexible, and if by chance not enough

22

tax-free cigarettes are brought to the reservation and

23

brought to the reservation retailers, they can, under our

24

tax law, specifically apply for a refund.

refund worked, both as a matter of -- would there be

2

interest on the prepayment, if there's a refund, and how

3

long is the process to get a refund?

4

GENERAL KOPPELL:

I don't know -- I don't know,

5

to tell you the truth, Your Honor, the details of that,

6

but the fact of the matter is that there is a process.

7

You just show that you made a tax-free sale, and that you

8

prepaid the tax, and then you get the money back.

9

QUESTION:

Yes, but if it's a prolonged process

10

and there's no interest, then you are also making an

11

interest-free loan to the State of New York, are you not?
GENERAL KOPPELL:

12

Well, if it's a prolonged

3

process, which we do not believe it would be -- it has not

4

been implemented yet.

5

would be a prolonged process, and in fact the tax

6

department regulations contemplate a very generous supply

7

of tax-free cigarettes to the reservation.

We don't see any reason why it

It's costing the State $ 00 million a

The tax department's not looking to make sure

23

that every single package of cigarettes that's untaxed is

not -- that no package of cigarettes untaxed is sold to a

sales even 6 years ago -- even 6 years ago was over 30

2

times the estimated demand by Native Americans on the

3

reservation.

4

the State over $100 million.

5

We're talking about massive evasion costing

So once these estimates are made, it is

6

anticipated that there will be more than enough tax-free

7

cigarettes flowing from the wholesalers like the

8

respondents here onto the reservation, and it will not be

9

necessary to go down and check each sale.

10

Furthermore, the alternative to this system

11

would be far more intrusive, because if you had an

12

alternative of only collecting the tax from the Indian

13

retailers and leaving the wholesalers alone, think of what

14

that would require.

15

auditing all of these retailers -- and you know how much

16

the Indians resent intrusion by outsiders on the

17

reservation -- coming into each of the Indian smoke shops,

18

checking all of their books and sales to see how many tax-

19

free cigarettes they sold --

20

QUESTION:

That would require going in and

But didn't we uphold some sort of

21

procedure like that in either Moe or Colville, and wasn't

22

that done at the retail level?

23

GENERAL KOPPELL:

Yes, it -- yes, Your Honor, it

24

was upheld that one could do that.

1

case ensued, and you will recall, Your Honor, that in the

2

Potawatomi decision, you indicated that if there were

3

problems collecting from the retailers, or going after the

4

retailers, you suggested you can well go after the

5

wholesalers, and I think that was a recognition that going

6

after the retailers is a difficult thing to do and is a

7

very intrusive thing to do.

8

9

And I am not suggesting here that in fact that
if the burden was placed on the retailers it would

10

necessarily violate the Indian Traders Act.

11

suggesting, however, that this is a much less intrusive

12

way of dealing with this problem -- creating a realistic

13

assessment, or allotment of tax-free cigarettes to go into

14

the reservation, then providing for the wholesalers to be

15

able to sell that inventory without tax stamp.

16

What I am

The remainder of the inventory that the

17

wholesalers have would bear the tax stamps, would have the

18

prepayment of taxes attached to them, and by -- and then

19

having a system down the line that allows for the

20

wholesalers to distribute the tax-free cigarettes to the

21

retailers based on these coupons that the Department of

22

Taxation would issue to the retailers, who would then

23

present them to the wholesalers.

24
25

We are looking now at how much this burdens the
wholesalers.

All they have to do is get sufficient

1

inventory to meet the tax-free demand, wait for the

2

retailers to come to them with the coupons, and then

3

record the tax-free transactions and the taxable

4

transactions, and obviously on the taxable transactions

5

remit the advance payment of the tax.

6

From the point of view of the Attea Brothers,

7

this is not a complicated or burdensome system, and the

8

court of appeals was simply wrong when it suggested that

9

there were significant burdens imposed on respondents by

10

this system, and again, as I mentioned when I answered

11

Justice Ginsburg's questions, the court of appeals was

12

certainly wrong when they said that this somehow limits

13

the number or quantity of goods available on the Indian

14

reservations.

15
16

QUESTION:

19
20
21

General Koppell, are there Federal

taxes imposed on the cigarettes?

17
18

In no way does it do that.

GENERAL KOPPELL:

I believe there are, Your Honor.

Is that handled by any kind of a

stamp mechanism?

haven't really studied that.

with cigarettes.
GENERAL KOPPELL:

7

QUESTION:

9

Yes.

That's why the problem only arises

6

8

Yes.

Yes, that is correct.

But it could happen for sales of

other goods as well.
GENERAL KOPPELL:

Yes, and there have been very

10

serious problems when New York has attempted to collect

11

sales taxes on reservation sales, and we're trying to get

12

at it without creating, if you will a -- it wouldn't be a

13

civil war, because these are sovereign nations, but

14

without creating a war with the Indian nations, or with

15

individuals on the Indian reservations, and that's why

16

this allocation system, that allocates a certain number of

17

tax-free cigarettes, is the most efficient way and easiest

18

way and least intrusive way of solving the problem and

19

still retaining to the State the ability to tax.

20

Again, I say that there are tens of thousands if

21

you will, maybe hundreds of thousands of individuals, who

22

are evading their tax obligation.

23

remembered, and this Court has recognized in the Colville

24

case and in the Moe case particularly, that the tax

25

obligation is not on the wholesaler or the retailer.

It should be

1

The tax obligation is on the ultimate purchaser

2

or consumer of the cigarettes, and the current system

3

which has allowed these tax-free cigarettes to flow on the

4

reservation without control has allowed thousands and tens

5

of thousands, indeed, probably hundreds of thousands of

6

New Yorkers, to violate the law.

you speak of the huge amount of evasion.

Do you accept

the figure that was in the -- I guess the Tobacco

Retailers and Candy Distributors brief that the -- at the

11

present time the average number of packs supposedly sold

12

to every man, woman, or consumed by every man, woman and

13

child on the reservations is 12,800 a year?

14

figure right?

15

GENERAL KOPPELL:

Is that

12,000 -- I think that the

16

estimate that we were given by the Tax Department was that

17

if the consumption in 1988 was really only by Indians,

18

they would be smoking 15 packs a day, every man, woman,

19

and child, so that the evasion is obviously substantial.

20

I think this Court can take some judicial notice

21

of the fact that with the introduction now of gaming on

22

the reservations, the number of non-Indians who will be

23

coming on the reservations will increase exponentially,

24

and we will only have a greater problem with respect to

GENERAL KOPPELL:

You -- well, as you know, Your

taxation on both cigarettes and gasoline is in the other

direction.
QUESTION:

I don't have a precise hypothetical

12

for you, but if the State were attempting to impose this

sort of regulation on some other State, like Baldwin v.

Seilig, we would have a metaphysical problem because you

would be regulating an interstate transaction, and that's

beyond your authority.

In our cases, do we ever make parallels between

GENERAL KOPPELL:

Well, I don't recall, but I do

know that there are severe limitations on our ability to

actually impact on the sovereign State itself.

I don't believe that the

I don't think that -- in fact, it would be in some

that goes down to the Indian, so in my opinion, though I'm

It seems to me the appropriate -- we are permitted

2

to provide for minimal burdens without violating the

Indian Trader Act.

4

The minimal burden here is not dissimilar to the

5

burden placed on retailers which has been approved by this

Court on a number of occasions, and it seems to me if we

7

provided for the prepayment of taxes on sales to Indians,

8

and then required them to go for a refund in every case,

9

we would be doing more than we're doing here.

We wouldn't

be doing less, we'd be doing more to invade an area that

11

arguably has been preempted by the Indian Traders Act.

12

I think we're trying to stay away from -- after

to the extent we can stay away from burdening trade

I also suggest that the Solicitor General's

with respect to this matter in Colville, where the Indians

I don't think that they can,

at that system, and I call to your attention,

incidentally, with respect to that a particular affidavit

which is in the record on appeal, pages 244 to 246, which

describes the system as respects the retailers, and I

don't believe that that is impermissible or violates

preemption, because I think it's a logical system that

allocates the tax-free cigarettes among the retailers, and

as I indicated earlier, they don't have to be licensed,

they merely have to register, and so again, Your Honors, I

1

Indians is preempted by the Federal Indian trader laws,

2

and that there is no room whatsoever for any additional or

3

supplementary State burdens on trade with Indians.

4

One factual matter that is important to stress

5

is that the respondents are wholesale distributors whose

6

only sales on reservations in New York are to Indians --

7

Indian retail vendors that purchase from us pursuant to

8

the Indian trader laws and regulations which we must

9

comply with with respect to all of those transactions.

10
11

It is a separate and distinct transaction from
the subsequent retail sales of which my learned colleague

2

complains, and it is our view that this Court has

3

sustained in the Moe, Colville, and Potawatomi cases,

4

reasonable, minimal burdens on retail transactions between

5

an Indian vendor and a non-Indian customer who comes on

6

the reservation, but that the Court has made it very clear

7

in Warren Trading Post and Central Machinery that no

8

burdens whatsoever may be imposed on the sale to an

9

Indian, and that's the business we have.

You're suggesting that wholesalers can be less burdened by

MR. ZDARSKY:

No, sir.

Your Honor, what I am

10

suggesting is that regulation of the wholesale Indian

11

trader, his Indian customer who purchases goods from him,

12

both of those parties and that transaction are regulated

13

by Federal law, and that the Federal law does not provide

14

for the addition of State taxes at the time goods are sold

15

by an Indian trader to another Indian.

1

MR. ZDARSKY:

I think -- well, Your Honor, I

2

would trust your recollection, but my belief is that in

3

Moe or Colville the Court specifically noted that the

4

Indian trader laws and regulations did not preempt the

5

enforcement of the tax at the retail level because it was

6

a sale to a non-Indian, and that there was an important

7

distinction between Congress' intention to comprehensively

8

regulate sales to Indians and sales to non-Indians where

9

there is no such intent.

10

I think that was set forth in the Colville case

11

which followed Moe, so the Indian trader laws, insofar as

12

Moe was concerned, I can't recall whether they were

13

raised, but I believe that the Court made the observation

14

in both cases that these were sales to non-Indians, and

15

the problem with counsel's argument is that he would have

16

this Court ignore the fact that there is an intervening

17

transaction between the respondents and the Indians and

18

the non-Indians who purchase on the reservation.

19

That intervening transaction is a sale to an

20

Indian, and the regulation which New York has adopted

21

imposed significant burdensome requirements on both

22

parties to that regulation -- to that sale.

QUESTION:

Why?

12

MR. ZDARSKY:

Because this Court has recognized

13

that regulating trade with Indians is a Federal matter.

14

It is so because there should be consistency, because the

15

Federal Government has a responsibility to Indians,

16

because the Federal Government has experience in

17

regulating these matters, and therefore there is a uniform

scheme that applies to regulating people who sell to

Indians.

does not include the right of a State to impose a tax and

about, we refused to do it in Moe.

6

to do it.

8

MR. ZDARSKY:

We expressly refused

Your Honor, I would respectfully

disagree with that reading of the case.

9

Our view of that case was that the rationale for

10

excluding the Warren Trading Post holding was that the

11

sales that were being regulated were simply the retail

12

sales, and what the Court held in Moe was that the State

13

could require the retail vendor to simply add the price,

14

add the tax to the price that he charges his retail

15

customer, and collect the tax at the time of the retail

16

sale.

17

The Court was careful to stop short of endorsing

18

a scheme that required the Indian to pay that tax, or that

19

endorsed any procedure where the Indian would be required

20

to front that tax to the wholesaler, or anything that

21

would require that the Indian otherwise be burdened.

22

It was a very minimal thing that only applied at

the retail level, and it is important to note in this

QUESTION:

10

Well --

I understand your argument about

11

preemption, but the question I really was leading up to

12

is, why isn't your -- why wasn't your preemption position

13

totally controlling of the sale by an Indian retailer to

14

either a non-Indian or an Indian, because it's still

15

governed by the statute, the Federal statute, isn't it?

16
17

MR. ZDARSKY:

We are not involved in that

subsequent transaction.

18

QUESTION:

No, I understand, but your argument,

19

it seems to me, would have required a different result in

20

the portion of the opinion that the Chief Justice read to

21

you.

22

That's where I don't quite follow your logic.
MR. ZDARSKY:

Mr. Justice Stevens, our position

23

is that the sales to the retail customer do not determine

24

the preemptive effect of the Indian trader laws on the

25

wholesale transaction.

Therefore -33

QUESTION:

1

Yes, but wouldn't your 100 percent

2

preemption argument require that there be no regulation of

3

the retail sales by the State, no impact on that at all?

4

MR. ZDARSKY:

No, because as I understand it,

5

insofar as retailers are selling to non-Indians, by

6

electing to sell to both Indians and non-Indians, this

7

Court has found that those sales that to non-Indians,

8

since they are not covered by the Indian trader laws, that

9

permits the State to impose a minimal burden on that

10

retail seller.

Whereas you sell only to Indians.

14

MR. ZDARSKY:

QUESTION:

That's -- that's --

That's the principal distinction.
That's right, Your Honor.

But in assessing the burdens that are

16

placed on the wholesalers in connection with that sale, it

17

seems to me that we should look only at the burden on the

18

wholesaler, not any subsequent downstream burden imposed

19

on the subsequent Indian retail sale.

MR. ZDARSKY:

QUESTION:

I agree.

Let me ask another hypothetical about

your position.

3

State couldn't impose that requirement if the wholesaler

is dealing with Indian retailers to sell milk?

MR. ZDARSKY:

I think that that's true, Your

Honor, because Congress has not authorized the States --

QUESTION:

MR. ZDARSKY:

Right.
-- to enforce those laws.

9

However, Congress has authorized States to enforce its own

10

liquor laws with respect to liquor sales, certain sanitary

11

codes which may have application on the reservation, and

12

in numerous other cases.

13

has come to the wrong place with its problem.

QUESTION:

Our view here is that the State

Are you saying that it's only

Congress that can provide the cure, that the Commissioner

could not say, well, this is a pretty good scheme that New

York has, so I'm going to adopt a regulation that says all

18

States can do this?

19

MR. ZDARSKY:

I think that the Commissioner

could adopt a regulation, Justice Ginsburg, that provides

21

for a scheme that would affect trade with Indians.

22

don't think the Commissioner could delegate to the States

23

some power that they would have to adopt a scheme on their

24

own, but a scheme that the Commissioner found proper might

well be imposed as a regulation, because the Commissioner

Yes.
You would not be.

You sell onto the reservation, to a

Indian.

13

MR. ZDARSKY:

You would not be an Indian trader

That transaction is the same as if we sold it --

QUESTION:

Even though the resale -- even though

the sale is onto the reservation and it's known that the

resale will be made to Indians, among others.

20

MR. ZDARSKY:

That's correct, Your Honor,

21

because the Indian trader laws and regulations don't

22

provide that the coverage at the wholesale level is

determined by something that happens at a subsequent event

QUESTION:

MR. ZDARSKY:

Yes, because every dollar that our

sell goods to that customer.

Are you saying that the State is

to the rescue?

10

MR. ZDARSKY:

No, I do not, Justice Ginsburg.

11

The State is not helpless, but they have taken no action,

12

as suggested by this Court, since the injunction was

13

granted in 1989, to try to collect these taxes.

14

They haven't tried to impose a scheme at the

retail level that might be possible, although the Indians

claim some treaty rights.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

9

MS. BRINKMANN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
We submit that the New York tax regulations are

10

invalid for at least three reasons.

11

preempted by Federal Indian trader statutes which occupy

12

the field; second, the State regulations are preempted

13

because they conflict with the Indian trader statutes in

14

the implementing regulations; and third, the State

15

regulations are invalid under the Court's reasoning in Moe

and Colville.

17

First, they're

Although we believe that pursuant to those cases

18

the State can require wholesalers to collect and remit

19

State taxes on valid sales to Indians and maintain sales

records, we believe that the New York regulations go far

beyond the requirements that were upheld in those cases.

narrowly as he said.

Will you explain why that's --

2

MS. BRINKMANN:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Would you just -- did I hear you

4

right, you can require the wholesaler with respect to

5

sales to Indians, did you say, or did you mean non-

6

Indians?

7

MS. BRINKMANN:

We believe under the reasoning

8

of Moe and Colville the State can impose on the wholesaler

simple collection and remittance requirements and record­

Indian retailers to non-Indian.

Collection, remittance, and what

MS. BRINKMANN:

Of the tax and record-keeping,

QUESTION:

Ms. Brinkmann, a fair amount of your

7

brief here was devoted to the effect of the New York

8

regulations on Indian retailers, and yet as I read the New

9

York Court of Appeals opinion, there weren't any Indian

20

retailers involved.

21

The New York Court of Appeals didn't base any of its

22

reasoning on the fact that there were retailers involved.

23

They weren't plaintiffs in this case.

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, I think that's

24

similar to the question that was just asked of me also

25

about the question of what's before the Court.

1

We believe that, as this Court in earlier

2

cases -- for example, Potawatomi and elsewhere -- has

3

recognized that the Indian trader statutes go to

4

regulating trade, commerce -- there are two ends to those

5

transactions, and in assessing the burdens on that

6

commerce or trade, it's necessary to look at both ends.

7
8

9
10

Also, the New York Court of Appeals did look to
some of the burdens on retailers.
QUESTION:

But in fact there were no retailers

who were parties to this case.

11

MS. BRINKMANN:

12

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

So one has to decide it only in terms

13

of the wholesalers' claims, and perhaps wholesalers can

14

claim that they are protected by the Indian trader

15

statutes in their dealing with retailers, but you agree

16

there are no retailers parties here.

17

MS. BRINKMANN:

There are no retailers parties,

18

Your Honor, but I think the New York Court of Appeals

19

recognized the inherent connection between the two ends of

20

commerce and trade.

21

QUESTION:

Well, in effect you're saying that

22

the wholesalers have standing to raise the burdens that

23

are imposed on the retailer.

24
25

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, for example, the

burden that retailers register with the State, that

necessarily is a burden on the wholesalers.

2

their customers if the retailers don't register, so that's

3

the most blatant burden there can be on wholesalers.

4

They'll have no one to trade with.

5
6

7

QUESTION:

It eliminates

What do you say to the respondents'

position that there's nothing derivative about his rights?
MS. BRINKMANN:

We disagree, Your Honor.

We

8

believe that under the reasoning of the Court in Moe and

9

Colville, that because there is a validly taxed

10

transaction on non-Indians, that there can be a minimal

11

burden of collection on the retailer, that that same

12

minimal burden can be passed through to the wholesaler

3

under the Court's reasoning, they determined that that

4

wasn't a transaction protected by the Indian trader

5

statutes, and absent some showing that it wasn't

6

necessary, that that was permitted so that the State could

7

recoup a valid tax.

8

QUESTION:

9
20
21

Well, do you think the tax can be

collected in advance of the sale by the State, if it's a
sale to a non-Indian?
MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think under

22

the Court's reasoning in Moe and Colville it could be,

23

unless, of course, the Indian traders could show that it's

24

more than a minimum burden, it's unduly burdensome, or

25

that it's not necessary to avoid -43

QUESTION:

1

But the mere fact that it's collected

2

in advance and is in turn transmitted by an Indian

3

retailer does not invalidate the State scheme?

4

MS. BRINKMANN:

We believe that the Court's

5

analysis in its early opinions in which it permitted the

6

retailers to be required to collect the tax, from that it

7

flows that that can be passed on to the wholesaler.
In Moe, in fact, that was the underlying factual

8

9

situation.

The retailer would -QUESTION:

10

The argument being made by

11

Mr. Zdarsky is that the difference is it can only be

12

collected at the time of sale, and no advance payment of

13

the tax can be levied, but I don't understand you to be

14

supporting that argument.

15

MS. BRINKMANN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

16

Under Colville, in fact, the factual situation was that

17

the retailers had to prepurchase tax stamps from the

18

State, and then they put it on the pack at the time of the

19

retail sale.
QUESTION:

that the statutory -- the regulatory scheme set up here

9

I could see how you can say that if

not an impermissible burden to make them prepay taxes that

are really owed by somebody else, but that they cannot be

forced to comply with relatively minimal record-keeping

requirements.

15

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, I think it's the

How does it know how many stamps it has to buy per period?
MS. BRINKMANN:

For example, in Colville, the

11

Court upheld the record-keeping requirement on the

12

retailers for both sales to Indians and non-Indians.

13

simple requirement can also be imposed on the retailer and

14

wholesaler to have a knowledge of where the cigarettes

That record-keeping would inform the wholesaler

saying, wholesaler, you prepay.

Now, you prepay, how is

3

MS. BRINKMANN:

Once the Court makes clear that

these taxes are applicable in the State of New York to the

retailers and wholesalers, there's no reason to expect

6

that there would be this type of wholesale evasion that's

7

alleged here.

8

9

Right now, it's based on good faith belief that
these are invalid taxes.

As happened after the Court's

tribe went back and entered into a compact.

Yes, but if it doesn't want to, it

seems to me it can stonewall the whole thing by saying

16

yes, you can precollect, but we're simply not going to

17

give you the figures upon which you can base a

precollection, and because the other aspects of the scheme

19

have been held to be unduly onerous, that's the end of the

precollection scheme.

Ms. Brinkmann.

GENERAL KOPPELL:

To be very brief, Mr. Chief

6

Justice,

7

cases relied on by respondents specifically related to

8

taxes on sellers,

9

machinery,

10
11

the Central Machinery and Warren Trading Post

in the case of Central Machinery of farm

to Indian tribes and Indians on the

reservation.
The Warren case dealt with tax,

State tax on

12

gross income of a corporation selling goods at retail to

13

Indians on an Indian reservation.

14

That's completely different, and not related to

15

what's happening here, and what illustrates that best,

16

Mr. Chief Justice is -- and I quote from the Moe

17

decision -- "The State's requirement that an Indian tribal

18

seller collect a tax validly imposed on non-Indians is a

19

minimal burden designed to avoid the likelihood that in

20

its absence non-Indians purchasing from the tribal seller

21

will avoid payment of a concededly lawful tax,

22

burden is not,

23

since this

strictly speaking, a tax at all."

The argument that we are here taxing the Indian

24

trader is simply not so, and it's -- the Warren case and

25

the Central Michigan case are completely different.

The tax also is not -- it's not part of the

price.

3

that the tax has to be added to the price, but it's not

4

part of the price and we're therefore not affecting the

5

price of goods, which is the province of the Federal

6

Government.

7

price on the non-Indian purchaser, which is concededly

8

valid under the Moe decision and the Colville decisions.

9

If you look in the appendix at page A46 you'll see

We are simply having the tax added to the

Furthermore, if the non-Indian -- if there was a

10

non-Indian who was in fact on the reservation and sold to

11

Indians, I believe that that transaction would not be any

12

different from a transaction between the Indian trader

13

wholesaler and the Indian retailers, in answer, I believe

14

it was to your question, Judge -- Justice Scalia.

15
16

So as I indicated before, the issue here is very
narrow.

1

There's no distinction in Federal law between a retail

Indian trader and a wholesale Indian trader, and the very

same burdens as have been approved in Colville and Moe and

by indirection in Potawatomi are placed upon the

wholesalers here and should be upheld.
