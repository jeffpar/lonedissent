ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MR. PINCUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case requires the Court once again to

13

assess the validity under the Commerce Clause of a State

14

law pertaining to interstate commerce in waste, in

15

particular, a State tax on waste disposal.

16

disposal of waste generated outside its borders at the

17

rate of $2.25 per ton.

18

hand, is taxed at only 85 cents per ton.

19

Oregon taxes

Waste within Oregon, on the other

Less than 2 years ago in Chemical Waste

20

Management v. Hunt, the Court invalidated an Alabama law

21

that taxed disposal of interstate waste more heavily than

22

disposal of Alabama waste.

23

tax facially discriminated against interstate commerce and

24

that Alabama had failed to carry its burden, which the

25

Court said was to justify the measure both in terms of the

The Court observed that the

1

local benefits flowing from the statute and the

2

unavailability of nondiscriminatory alternatives adequate

3

to preserve the local interest at stake.

4

accordingly held the tax unconstitutional.

5

The Court

Oregon advances three basic reasons why this

6

case is different from Chemical Waste Management.

7

withstand scrutiny.
First, Oregon claims that its $2.25 tax should

8

9

None

be upheld because it is cost-based.

The sum purportedly

10

is derived from costs borne by Oregon and its political

11

subdivisions from the disposal of a ton of waste, but the

12

Court repeatedly has stated that cost-based fees, like

13

other forms of State exactions, may not discriminate

14

against interstate commerce.

15

The legal rule that Oregon advocates would

16

permit the very sorts of burdens on interstate commerce

17

that the court has repeatedly condemned.

18

could be collected from vehicles engaged in interstate

19

commerce but not from vehicles engaged in intrastate

20

commerce.

21

out-of-State goods.

22

QUESTION:

Highway tolls

Inspection fees could be levied exclusively on

Well, Mr. Pincus, now, in Chemical

23

Waste Management v. Hunt, I thought we noted that in that

24

case the State had made no argument that the additional

25

fee was justified as a compensatory tax of some kind, or

1

that there were other justifications.
MR. PINCUS:

2

You did, Your Honor.

You noted

3

that the State had abandoned the arguments on that issue

4

that it had raised in the State courts.

5

QUESTION:

Yes, and so I'm not sure that that

6

case resolved this question, where the State comes in and

7

says, well, we're charging our in-State citizens these

8

costs by way of income taxes and so forth.

9

MR. PINCUS:

No, Your Honor, I don't think

10

Chemical Waste Management resolved that question, but I

11

think that several other decisions of this Court did

12

resolve that question, specifically --

13

QUESTION:

But do you think that we have said

14

there can't be any compensating tax of a different type by

15

the State on the in-State people?

16

MR. PINCUS:

No.

The Court has said there may

17

be a compensating tax, and in fact the Court has said that

18

it is improper to look only at the particular tax if there

19

is a compensating tax solely on intrastate commerce that

20

equalizes the burden on intrastate and interstate

21

commerce.

22

a compensatory tax doctrine that sets forth two

23

requirements that must be satisfied in order for taxes to

24

be balanced in this way.

25

and they have to be imposed on what the Court has termed

The Court has said that, and it has elaborated

The burdens have to be equal,

substantially equivalent events.
QUESTION:

2

Well, certainly the events are

3

equivalent here, the disposal of solid waste, whether it's

4

in-State or out-of-State.
MR. PINCUS:

5

But, Your Honor, the taxes that the

6

State points to are not levied on substantially equivalent

7

events.

8

they don't even attempt to come within the terms of the

9

compensatory tax doctrine, because they recognize that

10

That's the flaw in their argument, and that's why

they can't meet that test.
In income tax, the tax on out-of-State waste is

11
12

levied on the disposal of waste.

13

on income.

14

equivalent, so there's no way that they can bring

15

themselves within that doctrine.

16

The income tax is levied

Those two events clearly are not substantially

And what they're really arguing, making here is

17

an argument that the Court squarely rejected in the

18

Scheiner case, which is that the compensatory tax doctrine

19

should be broadened tremendously, really, and that a State

20

should be able to point to any kind of tax, whether it's

21

on a different group of people, or occasioned by a

22

different event, and sort of in some way point to those

23

taxes and say they balance out this tax and everything

24

sort of comes out in the end, with no real way to be sure

25

that the burdens on interstate commerce and the burdens on

1

intrastate commerce are the same, and that's the reason

2

that the compensatory tax doctrine cases have that

3

requirement in it, is precisely to be sure that the

4

burdens are the same.
QUESTION:

5

But Mr. Pincus, we are not so

6

demanding in other areas.

7

Immunities Clause, for example, it's certainly perfectly

8

okay for a State to charge more for hunting licenses to

9

out-of-States residents, is it not, and the theory is,

10

Under the Privileges and

well, they pay income taxes and what-not.
MR. PINCUS:

11

Well, Your Honor, I don't think the

12

Court has said one way or another.

13

Privileges and Immunities cases that Oregon relies on are

14

cases that struck down disparate fees.

15

never said, and in those cases the Court said, disparate

16

fees are not permissible, at least fees with that

17

disparity.

18

smaller disparity --

The Court has

I don't think the Court has ever said that a

MR. PINCUS:

The cases -- the

You think they cannot charge --- may be okay.

I'm not sure, Your

Honor.

tuitions,

2

being considerably lower for out - of - Staters on the theory

3

that the in-Staters pay State income tax and are

4

supporting --

5

tuitions for in-Staters of State universities

MR. PINCUS:

Well,

in the State university

6

context, Your Honor, I think the State there,

7

of disparities I think would fall within the market

8

participant doctrine that the Court has elaborated under

9

the Commerce Clause, which is where the State has entered

those types

10

into the marketplace, where it's not acting as a regulator

11

but it is acting -- providing services or goods in

12

competition,

13

discriminate in favor of its own citizens, and I think the

14

colleges and university examples would fit squarely within

15

that rubric.

16
17
18

really, with the private sector.

QUESTION:

You think hunting,

It can

too, maybe -- it's

providing wild beasts - MR. PINCUS:

No,

I don't think that hunting

19

would fit within that.

20

think the Court has ever said that the Commerce Clause is

21

in all respects - - provides protections equivalent to the

22

Privileges and Immunities Clause or vice versa.

23

I'm not -- first of all,

I don't

I think the Court has been very clear in its

24

Commerce Clause cases, where it's grappled with this very

25

precise question,

to say that taxes must be equal.

It

1

hasn't had to deal with that question in a Privileges and

2

Immunities context, and it may be that they're different.

3

But in the Commerce Clause context, where the

4

question is possible competitive disadvantages to out-of -

5

Staters simply because they're out-of-Staters, and that --

6

with the very, very significant interest that the Court

7

has found in maintaining a national economy, I think there

8

the Court has come down squarely in favor of absolute

9

equality.

10

And I think it would be a very significant

11

departure from the Court's Commerce Clause cases, again

12

where it has specifically addressed this question, to say

13

that oh, we didn't really mean it, rough equality is okay,

14

and I think the problem with the argument here is there's

15

really no way to know how rough the equality is, how

16

rough -- or whether there's any real equality in what

17

Oregon has proposed.

18

QUESTION:

But if you're going to insist on

19

absolute equality, that's a test that can never be met.

20

mean, you say rough equality is no good at one end of the

21

spectrum, but certainly absolute equality is just an

22

impossible standard to meet.

23

MR. PINCUS:

I

I don't think so, Your Honor,

24

because I think if there was a $2.25 -- the same $2.25 tax

25

on disposal of Oregon-generated waste there would be

2

equality here.
QUESTION:

Well, yes, but that's the kind of

3

equality that lets the State do nothing.

4

were talking about possible alternates, and that there has

5

to be equality between the alternate and the tax imposed

6

on interstate commerce.

7

MR. PINCUS:

I thought we

Well, although, in the compensatory

8

tax doctrine cases, that's really what the Court has

9

insisted on, and that's why the issue has come up in four

10

or five cases.

11

The Court has only found one situation, the

12

sales and use tax, where there really is -- where the

13

taxes are so interlocking, and the rates are the same,

14

that that test is satisfied.

15

But in a case like the Court's Armco case, for

16

example, where there was an out-of-State tax on

17

wholesale -- sales at wholesale of goods within the State,

18

and an in-State tax solely on manufacturing, which was at

19

a higher level, the Court said we're not going to balance

20

these two taxes, because we just don't know how much of

21

the in-State tax, although it's higher, is to make up for

22

wholesaling, and whether or not it in fact balances the

23

out-of-State tax, and we're going to insist, because we

24

want to safeguard this important value of the Commerce

25

Clause on equality, and the Court has done that -11

QUESTION:

1

Well, it's one thing to say we just

2

don't know.

3

we know, absolute equality is required, rather than

4

something pretty close to it.
MR. PINCUS:

5
6

It's another thing to say that based on what

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

this case requires the Court to come to the sort of
QUESTION:

7

But isn't it your position -- I think

8

you were candid before when you said, Oregon's got a

9

charge, $2.25.

They want to give everybody a break, they

10

could charge .85, but isn't your argument that it's got to

11

be the same charge for the out-of-Staters --

-- out-of-State garbage as for the

15

Yes.

QUESTION:

We think that is the appropriate
We think that's -Is there anything in between that you

think is compatible with the Commerce Clause?
MR. PINCUS:

Well, as we suggest in our reply

20

brief, if Oregon wants to re-allocate the tax burdens

21

among in-State people, it can do so through the use of a

22

subsidy to the people who are paying the $2.25 tax.

23

The Court made clear, it's made clear in a

24

number of cases, most recently in the New Energy case,

25

that subsidies are not reached by the Commerce Clause and

1

States may do things that may have very, very similar

2

economic effects to discriminatory taxes when they act

3

through subsidies rather than through taxation.

4

So in this case we think that Oregon could have

5

an even-handed tax, and to the extent it wanted to

6

distribute the tax i- the part of the in-State tax among

7

groups other than the generators of waste, it can do so by

8

use of a subsidy, and that preserves the value of the

9

Commerce Clause because the taxes are equal, and it allows

1

2

rational basis for State benefit, doesn't it?

3

MR. PINCUS:

That almost suffices for a

But I think the virtue of that is

4

that it forces -- one of the values that the Court has

5

recognized underlying the Commerce Clause is the

6

protection of out-of-State interests who are not

7

represented within the State's political process, and

8

that's one of the reasons why the Court has been so strong

9

in requiring equality.

10

In the subsidy situation, the people whose ox is

11

being gored, as it were, are the people who are going to

12

be financing the subsidy, and to the extent those are in­

13

state interests that have a voice in the political

14

process, the State will have to face up to the fact -- to

15

what it's doing, which is reallocating the tax burden away

16

from generators and to another group of taxpayers, some of

17

whom will probably be within the State, and that battle

18

will be fought out in the political process.

19

The problem with allowing the discriminatory tax

20

is that the people whose ox is gored there are people who

21

are not -- have no voice in the political process.

22

QUESTION:

I would have thought that you'd make

23

the same argument to invalidate the subsidy. It treats

24

out-of-Staters unconstitutionally.

25

against them.

It discriminates

MR. PINCUS:

1

Well, it does, Your Honor, but the

2

Court --we are faced with the Court's precedents, which

3

say that subsidies are different, that the Commerce Clause

4

speaks to the State's exercise of its regulatory

5

authority, and the Court most recently -QUESTION:

6

But the theory doesn't hold water

7

very well, it seems to me.

8

out-of-State students more tuition than in-State students?

9

Is that invalid under your theory, under the Commerce

10

What about States that charge

Clause?
MR. PINCUS:

11

No, Your Honor. I think that that

12

is a situation where the State is not acting as a

13

regulator.

14

market participant, and the Court has recognized that when

15

the State acts as a market participant and not as a

16

regulator, it may discriminate in favor of its own

17

citizens, and so I think in that situation, that lesser

18

charge is completely permissible under the Court's cases

19

and wouldn't be affected at all by overturning Oregon's

20

tax in this case, but here Oregon is acting as a

21

regulator.
QUESTION:

No.

nondiscrimination requirement was satisfied.
QUESTION:

participation theory.

4

MR. PINCUS:

It didn't rely on the market

It didn't, but that was not -- I

5

think that the university situation is a clearer

6

situation, where the State is in the market, competing

7

with private providers of the same service, and I think

8

it's quite clear that in that situation the Court has said
the State can discriminate, but when it's acting as a

10

regulator, it can't.
QUESTION:

Mr. Pincus, I'm going to ask you a

Well, Your Honor, exactly -- the

5

Court has another case, the Westland Creamery case, which

deals with some questions about the linking of taxes and

7

subsidies, but I think in this case what would happen is

8

we would -- there would be an even-handed tax to protect

9

the values of the Commerce Clause -- yes, then the State

10

could, from its general Treasury, rebate some of that

11

money.

is to look at Oregon's fall-back position in this case,

because its statute contains sort of a fall-back provision

21

has done is not to raise everybody up to $2.25, and have

some kind of a subsidy, it's to lower everybody's -- lower

MR. PINCUS:

1

That's why the political system, I

2

think, will take care of the question.

I don't think -- I

3

don't think it's easy to say this will all come out in the

4

wash, because one of the things the Commerce Clause

5

recognizes is that when in-State interests are squarely

6

confronted with shouldering the burden that is being

7

imposed on out-of-State interests, that burden may not be

8

as high as it might otherwise be, and I think that's the

9

process point that will be accomplished if Oregon is

10

required to act through even-handed taxes, and that's

11

something the Court has recognized repeatedly in its

12

cases.

13

QUESTION:

So if the tax just went into a

14

special fund, the waste disposal fund, and went right

15

back, it never goes into the general Treasury, everybody

16

that's in the waste disposing business pays the tax, but

17

if you're in-State, you get it back.

18

as a special fund.

Would that be valid?

MR. PINCUS:

QUESTION:

Well, that's -And they call it a subsidy.

call it a rebate-subsidy.
MR. PINCUS:

I think one question that the Court

23

is going to grapple with in Westland Creamery is whether,

24

in fact, there can be such a tight linkage between an

25

even-handed tax and a subsidy, or whether in a scheme like

that, where the general revenue funds aren't involved,

2

what you'll have -- what you'll end up with is something

3

where you netted out that's very close to a discriminatory

4

tax.

5

But even if that's true, I think there are -- as

6

Justice Scalia pointed out, it's not that clear that it

7

would work that way, and second of all, I think another

8

thing that has to be considered is what Oregon has done

9

here is to create a tax that recovers "costs," and I think

10

as it explains in the last footnote of its brief, it

11

defines costs very broadly.

12

out-of-pocket costs.

13

that might happen if certain events come to pass, it's

14

talking about social costs - -

15

QUESTION:

It's not talking simply about

It's talking about potential costs

Well, didn't the supreme court of

16

Oregon say that some of that material simply couldn't be

looked into in this particular proceeding because of the

18

nature of the proceeding?

19

MR. PINCUS:

It did, Your Honor.

It reserved

20

the excessiveness point, but I think this point also

21

relates to the possibilities of discrimination if the

22

Court were to establish a different rule for something

23

that could be denominated as a user's fee.

24
25

It puts tremendous pressure on the concept of
costs, because a State if it wants to engage in imposing

1

discriminatory exactions has a tremendous incentive to put

2

its levy into the user fee box and then to cast its net

3

very broadly in terms of the costs that it's seeking to

4

recover.

5

And I think not only the excessiveness prong of

6

the Court's Commerce Clause doctrine but also the

7

antidiscrimination prong worked to protect that, because

8

if the legislature has to impose the same cost recovery

9

burden on in-Staters as out-of-Staters, it may be a little

10

reluctant to inflate or cast its net very broadly in

11

looking for the kinds of costs that can be covered, and I

12

think exactly the opposite will happen if user fees are

13

granted some kind of an exemption from the discrimination

14

prong and the rule simply is you can do whatever you want.

15

Then the problem's going to be that there will

16

be great pressure to put more fees into that box to avoid

17

precisely the legal rule that Oregon is seeking to avoid

18

here, and the legal rule that has tripped up a number of

19

user fees that the Court has considered.

20

QUESTION:

Would it really be appropriate for us

21

to get into the compensatory tax issue here, because that

22

isn't the basis for the Oregon ruling.

23

Oregon ruling was simply that there was a relationship

24

between the tax or the fee charged and State costs, and do

we have any broader issue than simply the sufficiency of

that reasoning?
MR. PINCUS:

2

Well, as a threshold matter, I

3

think the question that we raised in the petition is

4

whether there is this exemption from the discrimination --

5

antidiscrimination rule for cost-based fees.

6

you're right, Your Honor, and I think that is the question

7

the Court has to resolve.

8

number of alternative arguments -- arguments that I guess

9

are in the nature of alternative arguments supporting the

Oregon I think has raised a

judgment.
QUESTION:

But of course, by the nature of the

12

record we have, we really couldn't come to any decision on

13

that, could we?

14

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I think you could, Your

15

Honor, because I think that the compensatory tax argument

16

that they're making here is a legal argument.

17

they're basically saying is, the rules that the Court has

18

elaborated in the compensatory tax doctrine don't apply,

the legal standard they are proposing, but I think under

2

the existing precedent, which is quite clear, they don't

3

meet that test, and I think the Court can hold that.

4

QUESTION:

Your answer, then, to the question

5

reserved in the footnote in Chemical Waste, your answer

6

is, no there can't be a cost-justified --

7

MR. PINCUS:

No, Your Honor, our answer is that

8

interstate commerce can be made to pay its way, but the

9

State can't at the same time allow intrastate commerce to

10

escape from that burden, that it's a two-way street, and

11

our answer to the footnote is yes, certainly cost-based

12

fees can be recovered, as long as they're recovered even-

13

handedly, but what Oregon has chosen to do here is to

14

recover the costs only from interstate commerce and to

15

give -- not to recover them fully from intrastate

16

commerce, and that we say it can't do.

17

QUESTION:

But in this picture it's got to be

18

initially a uniform fee and then you're reserving the

19

question of a subsidy, whether the subsidy might be a

20

subterfuge for the discrimination or whether it was a

21

legitimate subsidy.

22

MR. PINCUS:

Exactly, Your Honor.

We think that

really, unless the Court is going to rework significantly

24

the jurisprudence in this area that the Court has laid

25

down the clear principle the taxes have to be even-handed.

There is an exception to that, the compensatory tax

11

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS A. BALMER

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

13
14
15

MR. BALMER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
If Oregon is to recover its actual costs of

16

regulating its disposal of out-of-State waste that comes

17

into Oregon, a clearly legitimate State objective, it can

18

only do so in one way, by imposing a user fee on that

19

waste when it is dumped.

20

The question in this case is whether Oregon must

21

recover the costs of in-State waste by imposing an

22

identical user fee on in-State waste, or whether Oregon

23

has the flexibility to pay some of those in-State costs

24

with general fund revenues.

25

In answering this question, I'd like to address

1

three points:

first, the way Oregon recovers the cost of

2

its solid waste program, and why that method is not

3

facially discriminatory, and second, the reasons Oregon

4

uses some general funds to pay in-State waste costs, and

5

third, the absence in this cost-recovery structure of any

6

economic protectionism or any other impermissible effect

7

on interstate commerce.
First, Oregon's system for recovering the cost

8

9

of its solid waste program is not facially discriminatory.

10

This is a facial challenge, and Oregon's statute says that

11

"costs to the State of disposing of solid waste generated

12

out of State which aren't otherwise paid for can be

13

recovered through a fee, a surcharge on that out-of-State

14

waste."

15

Thus, the costs paid by out-of-State waste are

16

limited by statute and that has to be accepted, given the

17

nature of this proceeding, to the regulatory costs that

18

are attributable to out-of-State garbage.

19

waste does not subsidize the costs attributable to Oregon

20

waste.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. BALMER:

Out-of-State

How do we know that?
On this record, Your Honor, which

23

they have expressly said is purely a facial challenge, the

24

statute says they have to pay their costs.

QUESTION:

2

Right, but ultimately, a court would

have to examine the calculations that have been made to be

15

They've done it -- they do it and the

QUESTION:

MR. BALMER:

is transportation is a little bit different, frankly.

11

think this Court has always recognized that modes of

12

transportation, because they by definition move in

14

particularly susceptible to discriminatory State fees.

10

suggested exactly what Oregon does here.

They said, as an

11

alternative to keeping out out-of-State milk that isn't

12

pasteurized within 5 miles of Madison, you could inspect

13

the out-of-State milk and charge the out-of-State milk

producers the cost of that regulatory program.

Isn't that fair to say?
MR. BALMER:

I think that when -- if you are

ilooking just at the fee, that is true, there is a

difference.

They brought this challenge in a facial

6

manner where they had to assume the costs we were

7

recovering from out-of-State interests are the same as the

8

costs that are being from in-State interests, and that was

9

the basis on which the case was reviewed in the Oregon

courts, and the Oregon courts said, we can't tell on this

record that the fee is disproportionate to the services

the State provides.

QUESTION:

Now, if -There are two different notions of

MR. BALMER:

But this Court has always held that

1

the in-State waste generator, the person that produces the

2

garbage, there is a difference, but the benefit to the in­

state waste generator is simply an incidental benefit to

4

Oregon's efforts to 1) collect the costs of out-of-State

garbage, because there's no question on this record that

those are legitimate costs, and 2) to spread the costs of

Oregon's waste reduction efforts over all its citizens.

It's certainly a legitimate objective for the

of the cost.

It seems to me that would be clearly

MR. BALMER:

I think that example raises some

7

right-to-travel and other questions, but I think that if

8

Oregon wanted to impose a cost-based charge on out-of-

9

State garbage coming in, students coming in - - actually,

10

when you think about the student example as an individual

11

coming to the State I think it's a much more complicated

12

example than we've got here, but if we keep it at the

13

level of commodities, particularly commodities that don't

14

compete with each other in the same way, we think that

given the Commerce Clause analysis that ought to be

applied here, which is the more flexible Pike v. Bruce

12

No.

No, it's just that the material

13

that goes through has two different sources, one in-State

come from out-of-State have to pay higher fees.

recover the cost to Oregon of dealing with out-of-State

If some of those costs are not properly

recoverable, and in the first instance that would be a

matter of State law - - what did the legislature mean when

out-of-State commerce, then those costs would probably be

struck down by a trial court at some point after hearing

4

evidence on the issue.

5

QUESTION:

Wasn't there one of our cases -- was

6

it the Scheiner case? -- there was a concern about

7

plunging the courts into this morass of checking -- if

8

you're right that you can - - as a facial matter, this can

9

go on, and then you reserve the judgment of whether it was

10

cost-justified or not, that is kind of a morass to put the

11

courts into, isn't it?

12

MR. BALMER:

Well, I think that the question of

13

what costs are appropriately recovered is the kind of

14

question the trial courts deal with all the time.

15

In Chemical Waste Management, there was a trial,

16

and the -- over whether -- over the out-of-State fee that

17

Alabama imposed on hazardous waste coming in, and the

QUESTION:

Then let's go back to the larger

question, and then I think your answer is -- let's take

what Judge Ripple said in the Seventh Circuit Indiana

time an entity is involved in interstate commerce, any

24

1

the specific example of highways and bridges, but one

2

could conceive of many others.

3

The notion that your theory would apply would

4

allow the State to tax interstate commerce more heavily

5

any time there is a facility supported by general tax

6

funds.

7

MR. BALMER:

That is basically our position.

As

8

I said, I think in the transportation area it's a little

9

bit more difficult, but theoretically the States ought to

10

be able to recover.

11

commerce, as this Court has said, can be made to pay its

12

own way, and as long as it's not paying more than its own

13

way, the State has the option, should have the option, of

14

financing its appropriate share of the cost through a

15

combination of user fees or general taxes or all general

16

taxes.

17

Our position is that out-of-State

Now, again, this case is easier than a case

18

where you actually have competing goods that are - - that

19

are competing with one another right in the marketplace

20

there and the State is giving a benefit, as in the New

21

Energy Co. case where you give a tax exemption to Ohio-

22

produced ethanol but not to the Indiana-produced ethanol

23

that comes right into the State and competes there.

24
25

Now, in that case, Justice Scalia said Indiana's
subsidy for Indiana ethanol producers is okay.

There's no

1

problem with that, but the exemption that Ohio gave for

2

in-State produced ethanol but not out-of-State produced

3

ethanol was invalid under the Commerce Clause, and all

4

that we're doing here is giving a subsidy, if you will, to

5

in-State garbage producers that is funded not by out-of-

State interests but other in-State interests.

There

I think that in each case the court

14

would -- and in fact the court does look pretty carefully

15

at what's really happening out there.

16

has not taken a really mechanistic approach to these

cases.

here, and I think in this case, as you -- in your colloquy

the in-State people $1.40?

I think the court

The court says, where are the economic forces

go through that administrative process in order to further

a -- sort of a hypothetical or a Commerce Clause interest

3

that I think is somewhat difficult to define.

4

QUESTION:

But it seems to me that the change in

5

our prior Commerce Clause jurisprudence that you're

6

proposing is a massive one, and frankly, if we're going to

7

change that much, I think it might be easier to simply

8

change and say, you can't subsidize, even out of general

9

revenues.

10

That would be a lot easier to administer than

11

what you're proposing to us, which will really be terribly

12

hard if New York State starts charging every truck that

13

comes through the State for police protection on the basis

14

of some percentages that's calculated in Albany and we

15

have to figure out whether it's true or not.

16

MR. BALMER:

But Your Honor, I -- and this is

17

the point I'd like to close with.

18

suggesting is also extremely sweeping.

19

really is that whenever a State uses general funds to pay

20

for a State program or service, out-of-State business can

come into the State and reap the benefits of that program

22

without being required to pay their fair share of the

and to the States that's a very difficult choice.

choice, they say, is either eliminate the use of general

funds and finance it entirely through user fees, or you

allow all out-of-State interests to come in and pay less

than the full cost, forcing State taxpayers to foot the

each out-of-State truck of the highways, and could charge

3

each out-of-State truck just that amount of use, that you

could charge out-of-State truckers a fee without charging

5

in-State truckers a fee.

6

cases.

7

That's my recollection of those

We at least speak in those terms, that the

8

problem with the taxes is if you're an out-of-State

9

trucker you have to pay this flat fee no matter how much

10

you use the highways.

11

could compute how much each out-of-State truck used the

12

highways, a fee for just that use would be okay, even

13

though you don't charge in-State truckers, as truckers,

14

any particular amount.

15
16

Now, if that's true, how does that apply?

Are

highways different from garbage disposal sites?

The implication is, well, if we

No, Your Honor.

I think I'm going

to have to disagree with your premise.

MR. PINCUS:

All right.
What the Court has focused on in

those cases -- the Commerce Clause has two of its four

antidiscrimination.

discussing is the apportionment problem.

What's an example of a tax that's

fairly apportioned but is discriminatory?

(Laughter.)

QUESTION:

13

MR. PINCUS:

This one is an example.

Take a preceding case, a prior case.
I don't -- I think the Court has

14

found that taxes are also unfairly -- are both unfairly

15

apportioned and discriminatory.

that we cited - -

QUESTION:

I think in the Guy case

But I'm asking you for a case to

18

illustrate the example you just gave in your answer to

19

Justice Scalia, where the apportionment is fair, but the

20

Court nonetheless found it discriminatory.

21

MR. PINCUS:

In the Guy case, Guy v. City of

22

Baltimore, which is an 1880 case that we cite in our

23

briefs, the question was whether Baltimore's

24

discriminatory wharfage fee, which was imposed only on

25

non-Maryland ships, was constitutional, and there was

1

conceded in the case that it was not an excessive fee,

2

which I think would be a proxy for it was fairly

3

apportioned and not excessive, but the Court nonetheless

4

held that because it was imposed only on non-Maryland

5

ships it was discriminatory.
QUESTION:

6

7

Any other case between 1880 and the

present time?

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. PINCUS:

No, Your Honor.

I think this has

10

not come up that often because I think States have

11

recognized that the kinds of hypotheticals that have been

12

discussed here are out-of-bounds under the Commerce

13

Clause.

14

don't enact them.

They're so blatantly discriminatory that States

I think in the Seventh Circuit case that struck

15
16

down the Indiana statute similar to the one at issue here,

17

the Court said of course this is unconstitutional, so I

18

just don't think it's something that has come up very

19

often.
Let me make a couple of points.

20

I think

21

Mr. Balmer's argument that this statute is not facially

22

discriminatory assumes the outcome of the compensatory tax

23

inquiry.

24

intrastate commerce is the same, but here no one knows,

25

because the general taxes that Oregon relies on are paid

He's assuming that the burden on interstate and

1

both by in-State interests and out-of-state interests.

2

Oregon taxes non-Oregonians.

3

QUESTION:

I guess your clients chose this kind

4

of limited administrative proceeding to follow, where the

5

proof was strictly limited.

6

entitled to prevail?

7

the State could defend its scheme?

8

9

MR. PINCUS:

Now, in that setting, who's

Is there no circumstance under which

Well, Your Honor, I think if the

Court were to agree that legally Oregon -- the rules of

10

the compensatory tax doctrine don't apply, and as the

11

Court said in Scheiner and as Justice Ginsburg note the

12

Court can just balance any kind of taxes in deciding

13

whether there's equality, then I think the case would go

14

back and Oregon would try and prove it - - maybe not in

15

this proceeding but in another one, whether or not that's

16

true, but I think the Court can, based on its precedents,

17

rule here that it doesn't even -- that inquiry, factual

18

inquiry is out of bounds at the outset.

19

QUESTION:

That was the case you brought.

20

brought a strictly legal case.

21

how cost-justified it is.

MR. PINCUS:

You can't do it no matter

Exactly, Your Honor, and we think

23

that the options here are either the tax can be struck

24

down, or the Court can say there are factual questions

Well, you lose this case and then you

Yes, Your Honor.

The excessiveness

issue is open.

5

Let me just add one other point, which is I

6

think Mr. Balmer conceded that if this case involved

7

apples or other kinds of commerce it would be a different

8

case, and this would not be appropriate.

9

that conclusion, but he certainly said it's different, and

He didn't reach

10

I think the trash-is-different argument is one that the

11

Court has rejected three times now and squarely rejected

12

in Fort Gratiot and it seems to me that disposes of their

13

case.

14

They admit that if this was apples, and the

15

question was an apple inspection tax, and Oregon was here

16

saying our apple industry is so great for our State we'd

17

like to share the cost of inspection and not impose it

18

solely on the growers but have other taxpayers, which may

19

include taxpayers engaged in interstate commerce, pick up

20

the tab, that would be inappropriate.

21

same result is inappropriate here, because the Court has

22

repeatedly that the same Commerce Clause rules are going

23

to apply in the trash context.

24
25

Well, we think the

One last point, in terms of what costs are
covered by this fee, the statute says that the fee can't
