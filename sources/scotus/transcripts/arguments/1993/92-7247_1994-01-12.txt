MS. ALEXANDER:

QUESTION:

6

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, where -- where would the

Government be free to move her if she gets her injunction?

7

MS. ALEXANDER:

She -- where she is is not

8

inconsistent with -- with the injunctive relief she seeks,

9

because it's -- this would, again, become relevant on

10

remand should the Government seek to -- again, to transfer

11

her to a penitentiary.
QUESTION:

12

Well, she was sentenced to a term

13

that would ordinarily end her up in a penitentiary, was

14

she not?

15

MS. ALEXANDER:

Your Honor, after sentencing she

16

was -- she was eligible for confinement either in a

17

penitentiary or in a Federal correctional institution,

18

within that -- the whole range of Bureau of Prisons

facilities.
QUESTION:

20

And so her -- would -- her injunction

21

would request that she be confined only in an FCI and not

QUESTION:

Government's view of the standard, I suppose, because the

13

So it's only with respect to the -- the damage action for

the past harm that the standard might make a difference,

isn't that so?

16

MS. ALEXANDER:

I'm not certain that's true.

17

What I can -- what I can imagine is a situation in which

18

the petitioner would be able to prove that the -- the risk

19

was obvious that placement, again in Terre Haute or in

20

Leavenworth or in another penitentiary, would place her at

21

reasonable risk, and yet the Government's position was --

QUESTION:

What is a

In terms of the injunctive relief

8

that you're seeking, though, I don't comprehend why Farmer

9

is more at risk in a maximum security facility than at a

10

medium security facility.
MS. ALEXANDER:

11

The allegation in this case is

12

that the primary risk came from the fact that violent

13

individuals were allowed to have access to her in the

14

general population at Terre Haute.

15

confinement of violent other prisoners that she pointed to

16

as a risk to her, and that within 10 days of her placement

in general population at Terre Haute materialized in her

rape.

QUESTION:

It is -- it is -- the

And yet she did -- did want to be in

didn't she object to being in administrative detention?

in that case, with the prison officials that the only safe

placement was in segregation, not in general population at

QUESTION:

She has a

The Federal court agreed,

Well, isn't it a part of your case,

8

just to follow this line of questioning, that the maximum

9

security prisons are the most dangerous because they have

10

the most dangerous people, or is that not your case?
MS. ALEXANDER:

11

Is it not the argument.

The

12

argument is what is a dangerous facility has to do with a

13

number of factors, the characteristics of the

14

prisoner -- in this case this was a prisoner who was at

15

extraordinarily unusual risk -- and the characteristics of

16

the facility, the particular facility.

17

If in a facility with very violent offenders,

18

inappropriate and inadequate steps are taken to protect

19

the prisoners, that is a facility in which there is

extraordinarily high risk of what happened to this

MS. ALEXANDER:

There -- one could easily

imagine a number of facilities in which a person as

3

described by Your Honor would be at obvious and

4

unreasonable risk in general population.

5

On the basis of the statements of the

respondents in the trial court denying actual knowledge,

the trial court threw out this complaint on summary

judgment without allowing petitioner an opportunity to

conduct discovery.

QUESTION:

This -But at least as far as the

11

transferring officials are concerned, they didn't know,

12

did they, what the placement would be inside Terre Haute,

13

whether it was going to be to administrative segregation

14

or general population?

15

MS. ALEXANDER:

Well, they knew this much.

16

First of all, two of them filed declarations in which they

17

said they had knowledge about conditions at Terre Haute,

18

in the trial court.

19

that the transfer documents were in the process of

20

classification in the Bureau of Prisons, things that

21

ordinarily are -- their function is to determine

placement, their function is have -- to have to do with

Well, do you --do you agree that

you -- that you have to show that the prison officials

But the Government's standard is that we -- a

was obvious, that can be circumstantial evidence of actual

knowledge, and that's a reasonable concession on the

Government's part.

QUESTION:

But the -In other words, the Government has --

on the Government's theory, the official has got to draw

whereas under your standard you don't have to prove that

19

the conclusion was actually drawn, you simply have to

20

prove knowledge of the facts that made it obvious.
MS. ALEXANDER:

21

That's right.

And -- and

because of the Government's concession in this case,

1

Petitioner argues that deliberate indifference

2

exists when a risk of serious and likely harm was either

3

known or obvious to the defendants, defendants had the

4

ability to forestall the harm but defendants nonetheless

5

failed to act.

6

clarify -- this standard requires a demonstration that the

7

defendants knew the underlying facts that rendered the

8

risk obvious.

9

require proof that the defendants recognized an obvious

11

And like respondent's standard -- again to

Unlike respondent's standard, it does not

risk when they saw it.
This is a rights standard because inherent in

12

the affirmative duty that prison officials owe to protect

13

the safety of those in their care is at least, at least a

14

duty to know what is obvious to anyone in their position.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't your standard come

pretty close to being just negligence?
MS. ALEXANDER:

No, Your Honor.

This is a

18

deliberate indifference standard, word for word, that

19

comes from the City of Canton v. Harris case.

20

QUESTION:

Yes, but you really water it down, it

21

seems to me, in your application.

You say that simply

22

awareness of an obvious risk is enough, that one -- the

23

fact finder need not further infer that their -- that the

24

person was deliberately indifferent to the risk.

25

why is that any different from negligence?

1

Your Honor, it's not simply

4

situation did not fix.

5

Indeed, Canton says we don't -- we don't apply negligence,

6

we don't apply gross negligence, it's only deliberate

7

indifference.
QUESTION:

8

9

It is when an obvious risk exists that the

This is not a negligence standard.

But we're -- we're talking about a

very aspect of liability, or state of mind basically.

And

10

the Government says you may infer deliberate indifference

11

from the obviousness of a risk.

12

have to do that; simply knowledge of the obviousness of

13

risk, without any inference by the fact finder, is enough.

14

And I honestly don't see why that's much different than

15

negligent -- than the state of mind required for negligent

16

injury.

Not necessarily.

They're just

grossly negligent.

3

MS. ALEXANDER:

4

QUESTION:

I don't think that's grossly --

It seems to me that we do -- we have

5

used the phrase "deliberate indifference" rather

6

consistently, and it seems to me what you're describing is

7

not deliberate indifference.

3

indifference, perhaps, grossly negligent indifference, but

9

not deliberate indifference.

10

MS. ALEXANDER:

11

QUESTION:

It is negligent

I agree --

Isn't there a subjective element to

12

deliberate indifference?

13

MS. ALEXANDER:

Yes.

And the subjective element

14

has to -- has to do with the fact that always the facts

15

are viewed from the perspective of the defendant.

16

do agree with the first part of Justice Scalia's question.

17

I agree that the Court has always treated deliberate

13

indifference as one standard, the same standard.

19

standard in Wilson says "deliberate indifference as

20

articulated in Estelle."

But I

And that

When one looks at deliberate indifference as

cases, in turn, use as their standard, those cases are

2

consistent with -- with the obvious standard, they're not

3

consistent with the Seventh Circuit standard.

4

And also -- that's also true of Canton.

Canton

5

is a case in this Court that gives the most substantial

6

guidance as to what deliberate indifference means.

7

is a case that speaks of obvious risk.

8

never speaks of actual knowledge.

10
11

QUESTION:

Canton

It is a case that

Canton was not an Eighth Amendment

case, though, was it?
MS. ALEXANDER:

That is correct.

There is no

12

question that -- that the Court was addressing a statutory

13

question, not the question of deliberate indifference.

14

However, it would seem odd if the Court were, without

15

telling anyone, to 2 years after it had announced --

16

defined deliberate indifference in Canton, to without

17

saying it announce a different -- adopt a different

18

deliberate indifference standard in the Wilson case.

19

And moreover, there's another reason why the

20

deliberate indifference standards appear to the be same

21

standards, and that is if one looks side by side at the

22

Wilson case and the Canton case, there are passages that

23

are essentially parallel in the two cases.

24

passages have to do with why the Court decides that the

25

deliberate indifference standard is the applicable

MS. ALEXANDER:

possible that in this case this standard wouldn't make a

claim here is that they lacked actual knowledge of an

MS. ALEXANDER:

Yes, Your Honor.

There might be

2

some circumstances in which the fact that the plaintiff

essentially represented that there wasn't an unreasonable

the prison officials know -- knew far more about what

of taking from the prison officials, who have the

that I also need to clarify is something that I think

reflects a misunderstanding on our part in our brief.

7

the end of our brief in talking about the possibility of

injunctive relief, we said that we thought that injunctive

9

relief was no longer -- would no longer be appropriate in

detention status because of his HIV-positive status and

12

the fact that he had been involved in consensual sexual

activity at Oxford.

At

HIV-positive inmates that if they are either predators or

them in administrative detention status.

understanding at the time we wrote the brief that the

petitioner would remain in that kind of -- either in that

What's going on there is that putting

that the Bureau of Prisons does but they don't do that

already decided -- and if it hadn't it should decide
now -- that it is a subjective standard.

You cannot be

deliberately indifferent to a risk unless you know about
the risk.

And that is the position that we urge you

to adopt.

Yes, if I can put my hands on it,

because I thought it was of some interest.

It says: "When

element of the offense, such knowledge is established if a
person is aware of a high probability of its existence,
unless he actually believes it does not exist."
MR. BENDER:

code definition is referring to is what's often called the

3

ostrich situation, the head-in-the-sand situation, that if

4

there's a -- if there is a high probability and you stop

5

yourself from making a conclusion, you turn away from it,

6

that that can also be dealt with as actual knowledge.

7

otherwise, I think you need to have actual knowledge.

Just the fact --

Well, then I'm not sure you do then

agree with the -- with the model penal code.

from knowledge of the risk that you knew about it, or that

13

you had the necessary subjective standard.

MR. BENDER:

Then you have to be deliberately

indifferent to the risk, which means that there has to be

something that you could do readily to avoid the risk, and

you have to have made a decision not to do that even

7

though it was something that could easily have been done.

8

That's the indifferent part of it, and the -- and the

deliberate indifferent part of it is that you are aware

that there's something you could do and that you don't do

anything to deal with it.

Now that's very hard to quantify, and I think

when he got to Terre Haute he would be put in a segregated

the situation was in Terre Haute at the time, and would

know about his transsexualism and his history in prison
