CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Woolsey, you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY B. WOOLSEY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WOOLSEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, Justices, may

In this case, the Ninth Circuit court ruled that

10
11

in the cases where there is no fraud or collusion in a

12

foreclosure sale, the high bid irrebuttably presumes -- is

13

presumed to be, irrebuttably, the reasonably equivalent

14

value.

15

We must look at actual values and compare them.

This proposition, Your Honors, is preposterous.

Now, counsel have agreed with me on

16
17

interpretation of statutes that we first look to the

18

statute.

19

on, we disagree violently.

20

There, our agreement ends, however.

From there

I say that section 548(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy

21

Code, which uses the language, and I quote, omitting a few

22

irrelevant words,

23

an interest of debtor in property if the debtor

24

voluntarily or involuntarily received less than the

25

reasonably equivalent value and the transfer occurred in

Now, equivalent value has got to mean equal

QUESTION:

Mr. Woolsey --

8

MR. WOOLSEY:

9

QUESTION:

Pardon me.

-- may I deflect you for a moment

10

just to clarify for me, what is the end result that you're

11

seeking?

12

transfer, but you are seeking what and from whom?

Now, you're not seeking any more to avoid this

MR. WOOLSEY:

13

Oh, under 550 of the United States

14

Code, under the Bankruptcy Code we are entitled either to

15

rescind, which we can't do because it's gone to innocent

16

third-party transferees, or recover the value of the

17

property.

18

limited to the difference between what the buyers put into

19

the property and what they got out of it on their resale.

20

If they hadn't resold and we were to avoid the transfer

21

and get it back into the estate of the bankruptcy, then,

22

of course, they would have a lien for their expenditures

23

on the property.

25

In this case, the recovery I think would be

Osborne, or who are you seeking it from?

MR. WOOLSEY:

Well, from Osborne and the other

buyers we are entitled to that.

matter of fact the judge sustained their motion for

9

failure to state a cause of action, so there was no fact

Now, from the Imperial
They were

We didn't go into the

hearing on the measure of damages.

11

The judge in the bankruptcy case that we take

12

the appeals from and this cert is from held that he was

13

bound by the then, he thought in effect, bankruptcy

14

appellate panel decision in Madrid, the 1981 or '2 case,

15

and he felt that controlled him.

16

decision cited by my opponents in that Kachanizadeh case

17

where he said if he had this to decide initially he would

18

come to a different result, but he felt bound by the

19

bankruptcy appellate panel and on that basis and one other

20

basis affirmed -- I mean --

MR. WOOLSEY:

The Federal Respondent would only

be to the extent of the benefits to the Federal Respondent

under section 550.

fee that they got part of.
QUESTION:

6

They might be limited to the trustee's
There might be other benefits.

But you're not sure about what relief

7

you're seeking, other than the difference between what the

8

buyer put in and what it got on resale?
MR. WOOLSEY:

9

I'm sure of that against the

10

buyers, and of course if that makes us whole, maybe we

11

couldn't get anything against the Imperial Savings.

12

QUESTION:

Okay.

13

MR. WOOLSEY:

Thank you.

Thank you.

Now, in statute -- in

14

this case where the code says that he can avoid any

15

transfer, it doesn't have to do with the type of transfer.

16

It doesn't go into whether it's a foreclosure transfer or

17

some other type of transfer.

18

comparing value, and equivalent value has got to mean

19

equal value.

The question is one of

The word "reasonably" before it has to change

20
21

that.

22

approximately, or nearly equivalent value, but surely we

23

have to have that, or else the sale can be set aside.

24
25

It modifies "equivalent," so perhaps it means

QUESTION:

Well, that depends on how you define

the property, doesn't it?

What is your proposal?

Would

1

you accept a rule that says if it's 70 percent of what it

2

would have received in an ordinary real estate

3

transaction, that that's close enough?
MR. WOOLSEY:

4

I would think that it would be and

5

that guidelines such as that might be appropriate for this

6

Court.
QUESTION:

7

Well, now that means that you're

8

willing to accept some individuation of the property in

9

order to determine what its reasonably equivalent value

10

is.

That is, you're willing to say, this is property that

11

is being sold at a foreclosure sale, right?

12

MR. WOOLSEY:

13

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm.

And property that's being sold at a

14

foreclosure sale is only worth 70 percent of what other

15

property is, is that not right, why you're willing to say

16

70 percent?

17

MR. WOOLSEY:

Well, no, I wouldn't say that it

18

has to do with the type of sale, I would say that the word

19

"reasonably" has modified "equivalent," and the only thing

20

I could think of is Congress meant something like

21

approximately, or nearly, rather than absolutely

22

equivalent value.

23

QUESTION:

If you're willing to individuate it

24

to that extent, why not go all the way and say, this is

25

not only property of a sort that's being sold at a

1

foreclosure sale, but it is property that's being sold on

2

a rainy Tuesday when some of the best buyers in town are

3

on summer vacation?

4

don't you individuate all the way, and so whatever --

Once you agree to individuate, why

MR. WOOLSEY:

5

That would defeat Congress'

6

intent.

Congress didn't intend to let a sale, no matter

7

how small - - there are some foreclosure sales have gone

8

for 5 percent of value.

9

such a sale meets the standard set forth in section 548.
QUESTION:

10

It seems to me we cannot say that

Suppose I say, I'm going to give you

11

a gift.

I am the creditor, foreclosing on a piece of

12

property.

13

to be sold tomorrow morning at 10:00, and I'm making you a

14

gift of that.

15

pay gift tax on?

I've already foreclosed.

16

The property is going

How much is that gift worth that I have to
How much is it worth?

MR. WOOLSEY:

Now, I don't understand the

17

question.

The Court is asking if the creditor is going to

QUESTION:

No, no, no, no.

I'm making you a

20

gift of property that is going to be -- of the income from

21

property that is going to be sold at a foreclosure sale

22

tomorrow at 10:00.

23

that gift?

How would you evaluate the value of

1

and if the sale under these State conditions which are

2

prescribed by law derives $10,000, you'd say the gift was

3

worth $10,000, wouldn't you?

4

MR. WOOLSEY:

5

QUESTION:

6

It is property that is subject to

foreclosure under certain State rules - -

7

MR. WOOLSEY:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well --

Well, of course --

-- and whatever it fetches under

those rules has to be the fair value of that particularly

10

individuated property.

11

MR. WOOLSEY:

No, I don't think that's the case.

12

That argument would destroy the application of 548 to any

13

transaction, it seems to me.

14

QUESTION:

Oh, no, if you didn't follow the

15

State rules, if it were a collusive sale, then 548 would

16

continue to apply, wouldn't it?

17

MR. WOOLSEY:

Well, I think 548 applies to

18

foreclosures as it does any other sale, because the

19

foreclosure market is not a market that is designed to

20

determine accurate value, and some of the cases we cited

21

say it doesn't evidence value.

22

be any price.

23

Congress has said, if it doesn't -- if it isn't at least

24

the reasonably equivalent value, it can be set aside.

25

Reasonably equivalent can't be based on the transaction

The foreclosure price may

It doesn't relate to value, and the

1

following State law.

2

that has set forth a Federal statute and a Federal

3

standard.

4

This is based on an act of Congress

As said in the Butner case in the footnotes, and

5

said in some of the other cases, 547, on prepetition

6

preferences, 548 on prepetition sales, 549 on postpetition

7

sales, all have to meet a standard, and it's a Federal

8

standard, and the State standard doesn't deterir.ine it.

9

don't think the State standard here, the fact that you

10

comply with the State standard doesn't determine value.

11

The State has a foreclosure system in order to protect a

12

creditor who can foreclose.

13

QUESTION:

I

Of course, your answer, I take it,

14

would be different if the State system imposed a fiduciary

15

duty on the foreclosing mortgagee, because in that case

16

the mortgagee would be bound to take whatever steps would

17

be necessary to realize the highest possible value, and I

18

think your argument is that the State systems

19

characteristically don't impose any such requirement.

20

MR. WOOLSEY:

That is true of State systems

21

characteristically.

I must confess, there's one case

22

cited by my adversary, the Bank of Seoul v. Marcione,

23

which held that the trustee does have some duties in that

24

respect, and for violation of that duty a sale could be

25

set aside under State law, but I don't think the State law

is the test here.

The test here is Federal law and what

2

happened in this particular transaction, and in this

3

particular transaction, a sale of less than 70 percent was

4

not a reasonably equivalent value, is our position.
QUESTION:

5

But if you had a -- we'll call it a

6

fiduciary State, and the fiduciary standard was in fact

7

satisfied, then it would be odd to construe the Federal

8

statute to require any different obligation.

9

that be fair to say?
MR. WOOLSEY:

10

Wouldn't

I don't think that is, Your Honor.

11

I think the Federal Government has set forth a standard

12

that applies in bankruptcy.
QUESTION:

3
4

No, but the is reasonably equivalent

value - -

5

MR. WOOLSEY:

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- and I take it that you're ready to

7

admit that what is reasonably equivalent takes into

8

consideration the circumstances of the sale, not only the

9

fact that it's a foreclosure sale, but the fact that the

20

foreclosing party may or may not make efforts to get in

21

real buyers, there may or may not be a real market for

22

this property, and so on.

23

All I was suggesting was that given the scope of

24

what the term reasonable implies here, if we were dealing

25

with a State that did impose a fiduciary duty, an

1

obligation to get top dollar and to take whatever steps

2

were necessary to take top dollar, isn't it likely to be

3

the case that satisfying that standard would also satisfy

4

the standard in the Federal act of obtaining what is

5

reasonably equivalent?

6

MR. WOOLSEY:

No.

I think the answer to that is

7

no.

8

equivalent value -- we're comparing.

9

value, not the circumstances.

10
11
12

13

The primary consideration here is comparing this,
We're comparing the

The circumstances are

secondary to comparing the value.
It is true that cases do dwell on the
circumstances -- the Bundles case, the -QUESTION:

Well, if you're going to -- if you're

14

going to construe the statute as implying simply a

15

comparison of values, why do you accept 70 percent?

16

MR. WOOLSEY:

17

QUESTION:

Well, I don't know that --

If I lend Justice Scalia $1 and he

18

says I'll give you 70 cents back, I'm going to squawk.

19

I'm going to say, that's not reasonably equivalent.

20

are you willing to take 70 percent if you're not willing

21

to lose your 30 percent in view of the circumstances that

22

as a practical matter would prevent you from ever

23

realizing the 30 percent.

24
25

MR. WOOLSEY:

Why

Well, I would rather the standard

be higher than the 70 percent.

I think the words do mean

that.

2

QUESTION:

Are you willing to take 70?

3

MR. WOOLSEY:

70 percent will cover us in this

4

case.

We're wiling to take 70.

But I don't think that

5

means that 70 percent is what Congress meant, particularly

6

when you take into account other circumstances such as

7

that in these sales we have advertising in compliance with

8

the State law about a little notice, not advertising the

9

type of property - -

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Woolsey, do you agree that

11

interpreting the phrase, reasonably equivalent value, the

2

circumstances of the sale can be taken into consideration,

3

a foreclosure sale on the one had as opposed to an arm's

2

Certainly the reasonably equivalent value is affected by

the economic law of supply and demand, but I don't think

4

it is affected by the type of sale.

5

is a foreclosure sale and the cases -QUESTION:

6

I think if the sale

Why isn't it effective?

You have to

7

put the thing together rather quickly.

It doesn't --

8

isn't it common knowledge that if you can hold a property

9

on the market for several years and wait for a buyer,

10

you're going to get a much better price than if you have

11

to sell it quite rapidly at what is in effect a forced

12

sale?

3
4
5

MR. WOOLSEY:

That is certainly true, Your

Honor, yes.

take that into consideration in determining reasonably

equivalent?

8
9
20
21

MR. WOOLSEY:

Well, it seems to me that that

violates reasonably equivalent if the value has to be low.
We have a situation here -QUESTION:

But then you are disagreeing even

22

with the Seventh Circuit, with Judge Ripple, who rejected

23

the Ninth Circuit's view but did seem to think the

circumstances of the sale, including the foreclosure sale,

25

was a relevant factor.

MR. WOOLSEY:

1

I've got to admit that it might be

2

relevant, but how persuasive can it be when the sale price

3

is less than 70 percent?
QUESTION:

4

I think that's my distinction.

In response to Justice Scalia before,

/

5

you were making the point that unless "reasonably

6

equivalent value" means something more than whatever you

7

get at a foreclosure sale that meets the State law

8

requirements, 458(a)(2) would be meaningless.

Is that

because other provisions of the Bankruptcy Act - - not
10

simply State law, but the Bankruptcy Act, will take care

11

of the collusive sale and the sale that does not meet the

12

formalities and the procedures required under State law?
MR. WOOLSEY:

13

That is certainly true.

In

14

548(a)(1) the -- if there's actual fraud we can set it

15

aside, and the other section is a way of setting it aside

16

based on the objective standard of reasonably equivalent

17

price rather than having to go into whether or not there

18

was collusion or fraud.

1

QUESTION:

And the irregularities under State

20

law, there was another section under the Bankruptcy Code

21

itself, I think, that would address that, so your point is

22

that this has to have a different office than to deal with

23

those situations.

24
25

MR. WOOLSEY:

I didn't hear Your Honor's last

comment.

QUESTION:

1

Your point about 548(a)(2) is that it

2

would be meaningless unless it had to do with something

3

other than the formalities of State law and whether it was

4

collusive.

5
6
7

MR. WOOLSEY:

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.

That's true.
Now, in this matter, my adversaries have gone

8

into the purposes of the statute, policies, and

9

legislative history.

I think where a statute is clear, we

10

look at the statute.

We don't need to go into the purpose

11

of the statute.

12

got to consider this:

13

property back into the estate so that it will be there to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. MANN

14

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT

15
16
17

MR. MANN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether a bankruptcy

13

court may invalidate a real property foreclosure sale that

19

was properly conducted under State law and held before the

20

bankruptcy proceeding began on the tneory that the

21

consideration received at that sale was not a reasonably

22

equivalent value for purposes of section 548.

23

I would like to focus here on two points.

24

First, that the language of the statute, taken in context,

25

does not require the result petitioner seeks, and second,
19

that a rule permitting invalidation of such a sale is
inconsistent with the principles this Court has
articulated for construing the Bankruptcy Code.
First, the language.

The key statutory phrase

is the reference to reasonably equivalent value in section
548, and in our view the key consideration in interpreting
that phrase is the difference between that phrase and the
phrases that Congress used in other places where it
confronted valuation questions in the Bankruptcy Code.
Most commonly, it used the unqualified term, value.

In

several places it referred to fair market value.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Mann, I think, you know,

it's pretty easy to conclude that reasonably equivalent
value means something other than market value, but does it
also mean, we accept as a per se rule that a foreclosure
sale yields reasonably equivalent value, or is it a
case -- is it open to a case-by-case inquiry, or is it
only a presumption?

The cases are all over the ball park

in how to deal with this.
MR. MANN:

Yes, they are, Justice O'Connor, and

I think the way to go about it is to try and ascertain why
Congress would have chosen the particular words that they
used and then look at them through the lens that the Court
has used for evaluating other similar problems the Court
has faced under the Bankruptcy Code where you could

1

interpret language in a way that would disrupt systems

2

that the States have carefully put together for dealing

3

with difficult policy questions.
When Congress said the value needed only to be

4
5

reasonably equivalent, as you noted, it must mean that it

6

could be something less than market value, but it seems to

7

me that it also must have meant that the set of

8

considerations that are relevant are going to be different

9

than the ones that would have been relevant if you were

10

just trying to ascertain fair market value.

11

Along those lines, it seems to me you have to

12

realize that the question of value is not an objective,

3

perfect question.

Everyone talks about how, well,, he

4

should just bid 70 percent of the fair market value.

5

person bidding at a foreclosure sale can't know exactly

6

what the value will be determined by a judge several years

7

later.

task later is to determine - - try to recreate a market

A

He's going to bid the amount that he believes the

20

transaction and to ascertain what would have happened if

21

the property had been sold in a market transaction.

22

In our view, when the property, as it has at a

23

foreclosure sale, has already been sold at a market

24

transaction, there's no reason to believe, absent Congress

25

telling us that the Court should do that, that Congress

the indebtedness and that's about what the price normally

is, or at least, very frequently is?

It was in this case,

for example, just a few thousand dollars over the
indebtedness.
MR. MANN:

Well, actually, this case is --

suggests something contrary to what you're suggesting,
because the mortgagor -- the foreclosing lender actually
bid more than the amount of the indebtedness, which it
certainly had no reason to do.
QUESTION:

$11,000 more on a $500,000 house, or

something like that?
MR. MANN:

Well, the question remains whether

it's a $500,000 house, but the point I guess I would make
is that the redemption period would chill the bidding a
little bit, but a redemption period at least has a
specific period of time that once it passes, everything is
over.

The rule that is sought in this case would not work

that way, because it would be a much longer period of
time.
QUESTION:

How much longer?

MR.. MANN:

Well, any bankruptcy proceeding

that's filed within 1 year of the sale, then, anytime
within the bankruptcy period proceeding until a trustee is
appointed -- in this case, for example, a trustee was
never appointed, then 2 years beyond that.

This can even

go beyond the confirmation of a plan in a Chapter 11

2

proceeding.
Until all the payments have been made someone

3

can come back in and file such an action, and then the

4

worst thing, from the perspective of a person who's trying

5

to purchase, is that if the transaction is invalidated,

6

unlike a redemption period, the person doesn't get their

7

money back.

8

9

When a redemption thing happens, the borrower
comes in, he pays off the loan, and the person has their

10

money and they can walk away.

What happens here is, all

11

you have to get is a lien on the property of indefinite

12

duration, and if the property has increased in value,

3

whether because the market has changed or because you have

4

improved it, you cannot profit from this investment, so

5

it's a powerful incentive not to purchase property and not

6

to develop the property after you've purchased it.

7

In a redemption period, we really have none of

8

those truly severe and constrictive effects, and I think

9

that's what makes this type of thing so troubling to

20

commerce in land.

2

heard anything in any of the briefs about the destruction

3

of the market for mortgages in the fifth Circuit.

4

MR. MANN:

The Fifth Circuit has had Durrett for

5

quite some time, and it is -- it's my personal experience

6

that third parties very rarely bid at foreclosure sales

7

that are conducted in the States.

8

9

I've practiced in Texas.

I haven't conducted

foreclosure sales on other sales in the Fifth Circuit, but

10

at least in Texas, third parties rarely bid, and one of

11

the main problems is they cannot, under any circumstances,

12

acquire title insurance because of the effect of Durrett.

13

Absent Durrett, you would be able to purchase a

14

title insurance policy, the title insurance company would

15

carefully peruse the foreclosure documents, make sure the

16

lawyers had filed everything in the right place and said

17

the magic words, and then if you bought it at the sale,

18

you could have a title policy and you would know you would

19

own the property, but you can't -- you get a policy that

20

has an exception, so you really can't buy the property,

21

and no one would be willing to make a significant

22

commercial investment because of the risk of it being

23

overturned, and I would submit that --

MR. MANN:

The information of the people that

10

have conducted empirical studies, there are articles that

go both ways on that particular point.

12

There's a very good article that we cite in our

13

brief -- I think it's by Professor Schill -- that points

out the fact that the relation between mortgagee

MR. MANN:

No, but it's also by its nature the

20

type of thing that you can't really have empirical data

Some States have made judgments about fiduciary

that that in fact is not even the majority rule, so that a

State that requires nothing more than the printing of a

As we cite in the

Why isn't your response, Mr. Mann,

that a State that has such a law that does not impose

fiduciary duty is a State that has by its laws reduced the

11

value of property that is brought into foreclosure, and

12

just as State zoning laws can reduce the value of property

and cause the property to fetch less on the market, so

also States that have such foreclosure laws have reduced

the value of that property, and so you are getting

necessarily, that imposition of a fiduciary duty in this

context is a good thing in the sense that it will increase

and look at section 548 as a whole it becomes clear what's

going on.
Section 548 is designed to recover fraudulent

2
3

conveyances, and the reason that we're worried about

4

fraudulent conveyances is that when borrowers become

5

insolvent,

6

reasonably equivalent value for their property because

7

it's all going to go to their creditors anyway, and so

8

Congress passed a statute,

9

of the States,

they don't have any incentive to seek a

like the overwhelming majority

that would allow a representative of the

10

creditors to recover the property if it was transferred

11

for less than a reasonably equivalent value.

12

Now,

in order to do that,

someone is going to

13

have to look and determine what the actual value of the

14

property is, because you can't tell if you didn't get

15

enough until you determine what the value is, and if the

16

property has been transferred in a voluntary sale such as

17

the one to which Justice O'Connor referred,

18

that the judge can evaluate the sale is by attempting to

19

recreate a market transaction.

20

the only way

But if the transaction that has already occurred

21

was one in which anyone who wished to purchase the

22

property was free to show up and purchase it and the

23

highest bidder purchased the property,

24

unlikely that a judge would be systemically placed to make

25

a better determination of value after the fact than the

it would seem

2

point and add to it the point that this is area in which

3

the States have traditionally been responsible for, the

4

Court has been reluctant to interfere with the --

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Mann, but the Seventh Circuit in

6

the Bundles case, in dealing with that issue, said that

7

the State has one concern, and that's the security of

8

these mortgage foreclosures, the procedure has occurred,

9

it's done and finished, where the bankruptcy law is

10

designed to preserve the assets of the State and to see

11

that what -- the debtor receives something fairly

12

equivalent to what he surrendered.

13

So the notion of the Seventh Circuit at least

14

was that the Bankruptcy Code provisions must be

15

interpreted in light of what is a driving force of the

16

Bankruptcy Code, which is different from the driving force

17

of the State law provisions dealing with foreclosure.

18

MR. MANN:

I think there's three points I'd like

19

to make in response to that, if I have time.

20

point is not necessarily in response to your question, but

21

I want to mention the Seventh Circuit rule.

22

initially attractive to have some sort of rebuttable

23

presumption to allow things to be considered, but from our

24

view the real problem with such rule is that it doesn't

25

really do much better than a 70 percent rule, because it

The first

It may seem

1

leads people who would wish to purchase at a foreclosure

2

sale in the predicament of not knowing for sure that they

3

actually are purchasing anything.
With respect to your question, I think that the

4
5

purpose of section 548, as I was trying to explain to

6

Justice Souter, it really hinges on the notion that the

7

debtor doesn't have any incentive to secure an appropriate

8

value for the property.

9

sale, the debtor is not in a position to be attempting to

When it's sold by a foreclosure

10

dissipate the assets of the State.

11

the matter.

He has no choice in

The creditor is doing it.

And moreover, at least in this case, and I think

12

3

that under State law it's generally true, although it's

4

not that clear, the sale is conducted by a third party who

5

is charged under State law with a fiduciary duty to obtain

6

the highest possible price for the property, and I think

7

in those circumstance it's quite difficult to see that

8

there really is a separate bankruptcy policy to which the

9

State has not attended.
QUESTION:

20

Well, if you were correct that every

21

State was a fiduciary State, you'd have a stronger

22

argument, but every State isn't, and I suspect most are

23

not.

this statute made it clear that Congress wanted some way

to subject this person to a higher duty than merely

9

10

MR. MANN:

Well, for one thing, obviously the

11

statute in California does impose considerably more

12

obligations than that, but I don't think it's clear that

13

Congress intended to have judges attempt to recreate the

14

market and get a better value than the market did, and I

15

guess that's the point I would make on that.

Any fraud that would have occurred in a sale

like this would be if the lender was doing something

wrong, and it would not be addressed by any provision

If this provision were not here, and if the

amendments were not there, then a completely collusive

with your argument is that if the phrase in question,

say it dees and imposes no more of a duty than you say it

11

imposes, it would have been infinitely simpler for

12

Congress simply to say that a bona fide sale conducted in

requirements, that's the end of the issue.
MR. SMENT:

I disagree in part, Justice Souter,

and only because I think in the analysis for determining
the reasonable equivalent value, the Court has to consider
the State law.

I mean, it has to consider the effect of

that and whether Congress could have - QUESTION:

But there's one Bankruptcy Code and

there's a variety of State laws, and some are more
protective, some have -- require more in the way of
advertising -- do some require an appraisal before there's
a sale, and some don't.

So there'd be such a lack of

uniformity, if your position is correct, whereas if you
take the position of the Seventh Circuit, the foreclosure
sale price means quite a lot, but it's not the be-all and
end-all because of the tremendous varieties in what the
State law requires.
MR. SMENT:

And it's the very fact of that

variety that precludes an application of the Bundles
decision.

For example, Bundles talks about appraisals of

the property.

That is not required in most States.

It's

not required in California for foreclosure.
Bundles talks about additional advertising or
broker involvement.

That is not only not required under

California law, it's assumably not permitted by the
California statutes.

I think that again, in considering

12

MR. SMENT:

I disagree in part, Your Honor.

I

3

think that a collusive sale could possibly be attacked

4

under Section 548, but when you have an elaborate,

5

statutory scheme like you have in California, and a sale

6

is conducted pursuant to that scheme, if you then step in

and allow a bankruptcy to create a collateral attack on

that sale that would not be available in State court, then

you're undoing the State foreclosure laws.

asking you what 548(a)(2) then does.

But you don't

you're not collusive.
MR. SMENT:

Section 548 is not limited to

foreclosure sales, so if we had a nonjudicial - - or a
nonforeclosure sale sale, the Court would have to look at
all of those circumstances under section 548.
I think that the Ninth Circuit's point of view,
and the reason for their opinion, is we need a rule of
certainty here, and at least in the context of a
foreclosure sale that has intricate statutory provisions,
that provides sufficient notice not only to the borrower
but to the public, and under a scheme that we've indicated
is intended to protect not just the borrower but he
lender, third-party purchasers like my clients, and the
public at large, those are the interests that are balanced
by the foreclosure statute.
And Congress hasn't said that in interpreting or
looking at a case under the term "reasonably" you can't
consider all those factors, nor that you can't have a
conclusive presumption.

This Court made it quite clear in

the Arizona v. Maricopa County case that a per se rule
could be valid to provide certainty, to reduce complex
litigation, to provide some business reasons here for why
opportunities ought to go forward.

That's why the Ninth

Circuit ruled the way it did.
We have a complex sale.

If we had a sale that

wasn't a foreclosure sale and didn't have to comply with
all of this checklist of noticing, published notices,
recorded notices, actual bidding, auctioning, all these
different requirements, then there might not be a basis to
establish a conclusive presumption because you haven't
jumped through all the hurdles to get to that sale, and
keep in mind - QUESTION:

Why isn't the better rule, even under

your own argument, simply that there is no conclusive
presumption, but that in California -- and I don't know
whether this is true or not.

I'll just accept this.

But

in California, you have done all, in fact --by complying
with State law you have done all that would be
commercially reasonable, and that when this case in fact
goes to trial, you ought to win it, and we'll assume you
will win it.
But in a State which requires nothing but, in
effect, legal publication for a certain number of weeks,
you wouldn't win it, and that's why we should not have an
across-the-board conclusive presumption.
MR. SMENT:

there is a law, you do need that presumption.

That --

Mr. Woolsey, suppose you have someone

who's on the verge of bankruptcy and, realizing that, has

a going-out-of-business sale, sells all the stuff in the

store not at 70 percent but at 20 percent of what it's

really worth.

Is he getting fair value, or reasonably

MR. WOOLSEY:

1
1

Your Honor, that comes down the

2

wholesale question.

3

to close out, he's selling on a liquidation basis for what

4

he can get.
QUESTION:

5

Where a retailer is selling in bulk

It's sort of a distressed basis, and

6

he only gets -- you know, he says 20 percent is the only

7

thing that will clear it, so he asks 20 percent.
MR. WOOLSEY:

8
9

Well, he -- at least it's a

voluntary sale and it's not taken from him, and he makes

10

the decision that it's best to sell it, and he can sell it

11

at a wholesale price.
Now, we have one case I cited in the brief, and

12
13

I forget the name of it, where someone failed to get a

14

markup.

15

should be a 20 or 30 percent markup, and the court of

16

appeals said it could be a little less than that, but set

17

aside the sale unless the difference in value is paid by

18

the transferee.

19

He got a -- the Bankruptcy Court held there

So we can have situations where we could set

20

aside sales that are liquidation sales, or sales that

21

are -- that are below retail value but above wholesale

22

value.

23

I think that Congress wanted us to look at the

24

foreclosure situation and especially said so after the

25

Durrett decision was rendered and the Congress has an

amendment to the statute proposed that will adopt the

Madrid conclusive presumption rule.

3

that, they didn't adopt that amendment, and they did put

4

in section 101 of the Bankruptcy Act, in the definition of

5

transfers, specifically the foreclosure of an equity of

6

redemption is a transfer.
Now, what does that mean?

7

Instead of adopting

That's the

foreclosure situation.

Congress wants this to apply to a

foreclosure situation.

That was a clear --

QUESTION:

10

Don't you think Congress had some

11

obligation to be clearer about that point if it expects us

12

to set aside the foreclosure laws of 50 States, which

13

until now have been assumed to transfer good title, and in

14

the future they won't?

15

obligation to be clear about that?
MR. WOOLSEY:

16

Don't you think Congress had some

Well, Congress -- of course, the

17

Court would find it -- the clearer the language of

18

Congress, the easier the ~ob for the Court, and the more

19

consistent throughout the country --

I'm just asking, where do you think

extent, but where's the burden of clarity?

I think both sides acknowledge that to some

Where it's unclear, of course the

Court can take into account extraneous things other than

the face of the statute to try to interpret them.

The

2

Court has to make a determination where Congress has made

3

a statute that's not clear.
But I think they've said, reasonably equivalent

5

value, which means something like market value -- it's a

comparison, a relationship.
QUESTION:

7
8

It doesn't mean anything at all.

Doesn't mean anything for sure at all, does it?
MR. WOOLSEY:

9

Well, I think it does.

I think

10

the words "equivalent value" are very clear, and

11

"reasonably" makes it a little uncertain and puts the

12

burden on the Court to make some decision about it, but

13

certainly not as the type of sale.

comparison of value.

It could mean something different in

outside the bankruptcy context.

Outside the foreclosure.

I'm

sorry -- outside the foreclosure sale.

MR. WOOLSEY:

QUESTION:

Well, there may be a difference.

Oh, yes.

So that in answer my question, what

other than foreclosure sales, I believe.
MR. WOOLSEY:

Well, I think that it applies to

foreclosures as well as other transactions, yes, and what
would it do if it doesn't apply to foreclosure, it could
apply to other transactions, that's clear, but here we
have, in 101, the Congress specifically saying the
foreclosure of an equity of redemption is a transfer, so
it seems to me that we've got to say that foreclosures can
be reviewed by the Court.
QUESTION:

And if under State law a bid simply

for the amount of the debt is always going to be
conclusively deemed to be sufficient, the equity of
redemption is always going to be worth zero, right?
MR. WOOLSEY:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

That's correct.

Presumably Congress didn't mean that.

MR. WOOLSEY:

I don't think so.

Thank you, Your

Honor.
Are there any other questions?

Thank you, Mr.

Woolsey.

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
