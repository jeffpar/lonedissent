ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN S. WAXMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WAXMAN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case calls upon this Court to make clear

11
12

what it has indicated in every case on this issue in the

13

past 30 years, and that is that a postarrest statement of

14

an uncross-examined alleged accomplice, made in the

15

throngs of custodial interrogation, which implicates a

16

defendant, is inadmissible.

17

This Court has repeatedly recognized the

18

inherent and unique untrustworthiness of these statements.

19

They are made in the coercive atmosphere of police

20

interrogation.

21

declarant has every motive to speak without regard to the

22

truth.

23

They are made under circumstances when the

These are desperate people in desperate times.
People that are arrested, their lives pass

24

before their eyes, and they were motivated to speak in

order to curry favor, in order to assist their own

1

situation, and for the same reason that is why they

2

attempt to shift blame to someone else, to put the light

3

on a different person, and to divert the attention from

4

themselves.

5

The Government in this case recognized the

6

inadmissibility of these statements, of Harris'

7

statements, when it took the extraordinary measure of

8

moving to sever Harris, the declarant in this case, from

9

Williamson, the defendant.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. WAXMAN:

12

statement we're concerned with.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WAXMAN:

15

QUESTION:

The declarant is what you're -Harris, which was the person whose

You pronounced it declarant.
The declarant.
Well, just so I understand what

16

you're talking about.

17

MR. WAXMAN:

18

Harris' statements in this case graphically

I'm sorry.

19

demonstrate the validity of this presumption that this

20

Court has repeatedly recognized, and why today this Court

21

should make these statements categorically inadmissible.

22

He was explained -- in custody he was told that

23

he would be advised what benefit he would receive for

24

making statements, cooperative statements.

25

the thing he needed to do was to finger someone else.

He knew that

1

That's what he could do to relieve the burden that was

2

placed on him at this moment.

3

everyone his shoes knows they need to do in order to get

4

out from under the criminal justice system at that time.

5

That's something that

They don't need to be promised.

They know it

6

instinctively.

7

benefit might inure if he cooperated was enough to effect

8

his state of mind so that he would speak, regardless of

9

the truth of what he said.

10
11

12

The mere suggestion in this case that some

QUESTION:

But the declarant did admit his own

criminal liability, at least to something in this area.
MR. WAXMAN:

He admitted very minimally that he

13

was a courier, that he was someone who was following

14

directions, he was a mule.

15

QUESTION:

He was found in position, and he knew

16

what it was, and he was transporting it, so that would be

17

enough to convict the declarant of several offenses, I --

18

MR. WAXMAN:

That's correct, and even without

19

his statements the courts have sustained conviction after

20

conviction based on an individual's presence in a vehicle

21

under these statements without even the incriminating

22

statements.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Were there conspiracy charges brought

against the two defendants?
MR. WAXMAN:

There was a conspiracy charge.

QUESTION:

1

Well, are you saying this entire

2

class of statements can't be admitted, Mr. Waxman?

3

Government seems to argue that it is a case-by-case

4

analysis under our decision in Lee and cases like that.

5

Are you saying that there is a broad exclusionary

6

principle, and if so, what is it?

7

MR. WAXMAN:

The

The broad exclusionary principle

8

would be that these types of statements -- in other words,

9

statements of uncross-examined, alleged accomplices such

10

as Harris, which are made in the throngs of custodial

11

interrogation which implicate in a self-serving way a

12

defendant such as Williamson, should categorically be

13

excluded.

14

QUESTION:

Well, you put so many qualifications

15

on it, though, that it's hard to know how general your

16

principle is.

17

All of this is technically hearsay, I take it.

18

These are people who don't testify at trial, and you're

19

trying to get it in as an exception to the hearsay rule,

20

and traditionally the declaration against penal interest

21

is contended by the Government, I think with some reason,

22

that it's a well-established exception to the hearsay,

23

rooted in history.

24
25

Do you disagree with that?

MR. WAXMAN:

We do disagree with that, but I

think the focus of this Court should be on this peculiar

1

narrow category of statements that falls within the

2

general category, and this is what the Court discussed in

3

Lee.

4

QUESTION:

Well --

5

QUESTION:

So - - you're not arguing here that

6

the declaration against penal interest is not a firmly

7

rooted principle of hearsay?
MR. WAXMAN:

8

9

I believe that it is, but I don't

believe the Court needs to get to that issue.
QUESTION:

10

In Lee, and in a subsequent case

11

coming out of New Mexico, didn't we really describe a

12

presumption against admitting the evidence, rather than

13

making it a categorical rule?

14

MR. WAXMAN:

15

QUESTION:

16

That's correct.
And do you -- can you prevail here

only if the Court adopts a categorical rule?

17

MR. WAXMAN:

No.

I think under -- certainly

18

under the facts of our case, the statement failed to not

19

only meet the requirements of the rule, 804(b)(3), they

20

certainly failed to meet the requirements of the

21

Confrontation Clause, and we should indeed prevail, but

22

I --

23

QUESTION:

But you don't want us to just stick

24

by Lee and the other cases that we've decided.

25

something more.

You want

MR. WAXMAN:

1

I think in - - today, with 3 0 years

2

of experience of these types of statements, and seeing the

3

validity of the presumption and, indeed, that these

4

statements are categorically, inherently, and uniquely

5

untrustworthy -- any person in this position instinctively

6

will seek to curry favor and to lay blame elsewhere.
QUESTION:

7

Why shouldn't - - as a matter of

8

general principle, why shouldn't we leave it to the jury

9

to figure this out and maybe give them some instructions?
MR. WAXMAN:

10

Because the jury was never

11

presented with the facts and the circumstances to be able

12

to fairly evaluate this statement.

15

was unable to show why Harris was motivated to falsely

implicate Williamson.

kept from the jury, and the judge could only speculate on

18

the state of mind of Harris and why he would make a

19

statement implicating Williamson.

By denying the defendant the ability to cross-

QUESTION:

20

That's precisely the

The jury was -- this evidence was

Well, you're giving us a lot of facts

21

here about why Harris' declaration wasn't trustworthy.

22

Couldn't those have been brought to the attention of the

23

jury?

24

MR. WAXMAN:

25

For instance, certainly the jury was made aware

Some of them could be.

1

that the agents advised him that any cooperation he gave

2

would be reported to the prosecutor, but do we know that

3

that's really what happened in this circumstance?

4

Don't we really need Harris to find out whether

5

a firm promise had been made, or what impact that

6

statement had on his mind, and how it motivated him to

7

make this statement?
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, you've certainly got the

ability to bring some of the facts before the jury, as you

10

indicate.

11

Harris, and that's what hearsay exceptions are all about.

12

You don't have the opportunity to cross-examine

MR. WAXMAN:

That's correct, but under this set

13

of circumstances, we're presented with a situation that in

14

every case is going to bring before the Court statements

15

that are inherently untrustworthy.

16

QUESTION:

What about -- is it untrustworthy to

17

the extent that they incriminated Harris himself?

18

about letting in that much of his statement?

19

MR. WAXMAN:

How

I think that that's a way that the

20

Court could go.

21

Justice Cavanaugh took in Michigan, recognizing that,

22

while a statement implicating the declarant -- the

23

declarant, excuse me - - Harris in this case, may indeed

24

satisfy the requirements of the rule.

25

Williamson was not against his penal interest, but indeed

2

was self-serving.

3

statement that Harris could make at that time to serve his

4

own selfish interests, and so the Court could certainly

5

allow statements such as those that Harris made which

incriminated himself, while excluding statements,

7

collateral statements which incriminate third parties,

which is --

On the ground that those are not

Correct, and indeed --- and on the contrary they tend to

make him a lesser actor in this criminal affair.

14

MR. WAXMAN:

Correct, and particularly on the

15

facts of this case.

Again, we have Harris saying that he

16

was a mere courier.

He was following the directions of

17

another.

18

was the one who procured the cocaine, who arranged for it

19

to be transported and was ultimately going to be the

20

recipient.

Williamson, he claims, was the principal.

He

21

He laid the bulk of the blame on Williamson, and

22

we're left to speculate why, and the reason is, is because

23

he had every incentive to lay the blame on someone else,

24

and Williamson was denied the ability to probe his mind,

25

his state of existence, and why he made these kinds of

statements.
QUESTION:

What would your rule be if the

3

statement which inculpated the defendant also included

4

admissions against the declarant which went beyond

5

anything the police might have known at that point?

6

your broad principle apply then?

7

MR. WAXMAN:

Would

I think the broad principle, and

8

the primary factor, is that we are in the context of

9

custodial interrogation, a context that this Court has

10

recognized in numerous cases is fraught with the

11

possibility of coercion, is fraught with the concern of

12

what the state --

13

QUESTION:

Well, if we're worried about that, we

14

won't let anything in.

15

out the statement or the portion of the statement that you

16

object to is that it's too much in the declarant's

17

interest to make it, and to make it falsely, but if that

18

is in fact part of the -- if that occurs in a context in

19

which the declarant is also making it worse for himself by

20

admitting more than the police would have had against him

21

at that point, doesn't that lend a note of probity to the

22

statement, and therefore shouldn't your broad principle of

23

exclusion fall in that case?

24

MR. WAXMAN:

I mean, the argument for keeping

I would urge that the Court should

adopt a broad principle that would be protective of

circumstances such as this, where the danger that the

statement may be not true and untrustworthy is great

3

enough that we may indeed have - QUESTION:

4
5

But the danger is less -- I take it

you would agree the danger is less in the case that I put.

6

MR. WAXMAN:

Absolutely.

7

For instance, I think Lee is a case much more

similar to yours, where the arrested person whose

10

that they had murdered Aunt Beattie.

They had committed

person who is not present, who has no opportunity to

I think that there's definitely a variant

MR. WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

So it's not as if you can't bring

this to the attention of the factfinder.
MR. WAXMAN:

Some of the facts and circumstances

15

can be brought to the attention of the factfinder, but the

16

concern is that they do not get the full flavor that

17

they're entitled to when dealing with this witness who,

18

whether present or absent, was the most crucial witness in

the entire case.

MR. WAXMAN:

11

Correct.
And the witness said no, and then

what happened?
MR. WAXMAN:

12

Ultimately, the witness was held in

contempt, and that was the end of Harris' position in

14

court, and at that point the Government went behind its

15

severance motion and put on the agent to testify about

16

what Harris said out of court, not under oath, about what

17

he claims Williamson did.

18

I would submit that the hearsay in this case in

19

those statements was even worse than that which was

brought in against Sir Walter Raleigh in that case in the

That's

It's a 1993 decision in which that court

repeatedly stated, have unique and inherent indicia of

unreliability because they are taken in the throngs of

motivated to speak without regard to the truth.

QUESTION:

It's sort of surprising that there

isn't more authority for the meaning of the rule in terms

19

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, quite frankly I think that

20

there has been some confusion under the rule, and the

21

courts have adopted numerous different ways of approaching

22

these issues.

23

Some courts have found that while these types of

person would not have made them unless believing them to

be true, they've said that a statement has satisfied that

portion of the rule, but has failed to satisfy the part

5

that most courts have read into it, which is that these

statements have to be supported by a particularized

showing of guarantees of trustworthiness, so you have

8

cases that have dealt with it in that way.
You have cases that have found, notwithstanding

similar to those recognized in Lee, that have said we're

State is trying to say someone else made the arrangements

MR. WAXMAN:

Why, it would certainly

I think Your Honor is correct.

There was reference to an unidentified --

Right.

Is all that you're arguing -- are you just

I take back what I said.
I think it would get in.

arguing before us a question of fact, that rule 804(b)(3)

24

was applied incorrectly?

MR. WAXMAN:

I think the Court could find that

1

it was applied incorrectly, and I would be satisfied with

2

a ruling to that extent.

3

QUESTION:

4

I mean, really what you're saying is that the

5

statement there that a reasonable person in declarant's

6

position would not have made the statement unless

7

believing it to be true, what you're telling us is, there

8

are a lot of reasons why somebody in this position would

9

make it without believing it to be true, therefore

10

Why would we want to go beyond that?

804(b)(3) was not met.
MR. WAXMAN:

11

Because I think what the Court

12

needs to do is to give guidance to the lower courts on how

13

to deal with these type of statements which are often the

14

most strong and possibly the only evidence that the

15

Government has to convict a defendant, and in cases that

16

have been decided by this Court - -

17

QUESTION:

Why should the guidance be anything

18

more than, take that line seriously, and you can say, to

19

the extent that the statement is purely self-serving, that

20

it doesn't satisfy that requirement.

21

it incriminates the speaker himself, it does fit the rule.
MR. WAXMAN:

22

To the extent that

Again, with that kind of a ruling

23

the petitioner would prevail, and we would certainly be

24

satisfied.

25

But what I think this case does is present an

1

opportunity to evaluate this presumption that the Court

2

has recognized for 30 years and has repeatedly dwelled

3

upon, and to say, what we are now saying is that these

4

circumstances are so fraught with the possibility of

5

deceiving the factfinder and concealing the truth that we

6

are going to categorically make any of these statements

7

admissible to prevent a violation of confrontation rights,

8

such as the one that occurred in this particular case.

9
10

This is not the only case in which the rule has
been inappropriately applied to this factual circumstance.
QUESTION:

11

But you conceded earlier, and I think

12

you're sticking to it, that to the extent it incriminated

13

Harris, it could come in.

14

Williamson together with Harris and connecting them both

15

to that vehicle, was there not?

16

MR. WAXMAN:

17

QUESTION:

There was evidence placing

Yes, there was.
So there would be some relevance to

18

having Harris say, yes, I was the courier, and then there

19

were at least three items of evidence that connected

20

Williamson to the car.

21

MR. WAXMAN:

What was that evidence, just his name

3

truck bore initials matching Williamson's sister's name.

4

There were no fingerprints of Williamson found --

5
6

There were, I believe, one or two receipts

QUESTION:

Is that the extent of the evidence

that connected him with the vehicle?

7

MR. WAXMAN:

8

QUESTION:

That was the extent of it.
Was there some correspondence,

something with -- or am I confusing this with another
10

11

situation, something with a girlfriend?
MR. WAXMAN:

The girl -- the connection with the

12

girlfriend, I believe, was the initials on the luggage in

13

which the cocaine was found.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. WAXMAN:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. WAXMAN:

I thought that was a relative.
No, that was his sister.
Yes.

She was not his girlfriend.

I'm sorry, I apologize.

It was --

18

the sister's name matched the initials on the luggage, and

1

I believe you're right, I believe there was a piece of

20

correspondence with the name of his girlfriend on it.

21

Again, what the Court should do is look at these

22

statements as being very distinct, ones that are self-

23

serving, and ones that are not.

24
25

While the statement against Harris may have been
against his penal interest, certainly the ones against

Williamson were not.
QUESTION:

2

What if they're inextricably

3

intertwined, that in two or three sentences, each sentence

4

has some declaration against penal interest, but also some

5

inculpation of third parties?
MR. WAXMAN:

6

I think, for instance -- the

7

example that comes to my mind is Lee, where there were

8

references to "we did this," and "we did that," and I

9

would urge the Court that -- the Court conceivably could

10

separate that situation out and suggest that those

11

circumstances be separately analyzed, but again, what I

12

believe is the crucial factor here is the fact that these

13

statements again are made in the coercive atmosphere of

14

custodial interrogation, and even those --

15

QUESTION:

Of course, if they're coercive

16

statements, custodial atmosphere, that's a -- presumably

17

the Miranda warnings take care of that, so I mean, we're

18

not -- I would think we wouldn't be arguing that point

19

here.

20

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I think this Court's cases

21

have recognized that even given Miranda warnings, it could

22

still be determined that a statement was involuntary due

23

to the coercive circumstances of the custodial

24

interrogation, but yes, that conceivably could address

25

these circumstances.

1

QUESTION:

So you don't agree that the parts

2

that incriminated Harris and the parts that incriminated

3

Williamson were inextricably intertwined here.

4

MR. WAXMAN:

Absolutely not, and again I think

5

the contrast here would be Lee, where there's a much

6

better argument that these statements were inextricably

7

intertwined.

8

9

Unless the Court has any further questions, I
would reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Waxman.

11

Mr. Manning, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. MANNING

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14
15
16

MR. MANNING:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Petitioner argues that an inculpatory confession

17

made by an accomplice to the police while he's in custody

18

should be excluded per se under the rules of evidence and

19

under the Confrontation Clause.

20

finds no support either in the rules or in this Court's

21

Confrontation Clause cases.

22

That contention, however,

As to the rules, petitioner's argument would

23

mean that no matter how overwhelmingly all of the other

24

circumstances of the case pointed to the admissibility of

25

a statement under the rule, the district court would be
23

1

required to exclude any such statement as long as it was

2

made by an accomplice to the police while the declarant

3

was in custody.

4

So if you think about this situation, if someone

5

went to the police and was in custody and said, I murdered

6

Fred, took the watch off of his wrist, and sold it to Joe,

7

that statement would have to be excluded in Joe's trial

8

for possession of stolen goods.

9

In other words under petitioner's view, no

10

district court could find that a reasonable person in the

11

declarant's position would not have made the statement

12

admitting to a capital crime, and at the same time

13

implicating someone else in a misdemeanor.

14

believe that that can be sustained under the plain

15

language of the rule.

16

QUESTION:

We do not

Well, Mr. Manning, under the plain

17

language of the rule, how much of this statement can the

18

Government get in, or is there some requirement that we

19

analyze the statement and each part of it to see whether a

20

reasonable person in the declarant's shoes would have made

21

it and thought it - - wouldn't have made it unless he

22

thought it were true, because there is some concern here

23

that insofar as the statement implicates Williamson,

24

perhaps it doesn't meet that requirement.

25

MR. MANNING:

Well, there are two distinct

cited on page 23 of our brief, the advisory committee

4

explained that a third party confession may include

statements implicating the accused, and under the general

theory of declarations against interest, they would be

admissible as related statements.

with the common law tradition of statements against

9

interest which, although --

requirement of the rule itself to be admitted?

MR. MANNING:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Now, that is consistent

Oh, absolutely, Your Honor.

And can it, insofar as Williamson is

concerned?
MR. MANNING:

Well, yes, we think it absolutely

16

can, for a couple of reasons.

17

when somebody is making a statement against penal interest

18

and describing his role in an offense, in describing that

19

role, he says more than just the core, I robbed the bank.

20

If you just think about

He will say, I robbed the Riggs National Bank,

21

Georgetown Branch, on Tuesday at 11:00 a.m., and there are

22

lots of facts that are part of that statement against

23

interest that if you took them in isolation might not be

24

strictly against the declarant's interest, but in the --

Yes, but insofar as the declarant is

seemingly trying, or could be seen as trying to minimize

2

the declarant's own role when caught red-handed and have

3

the major offender be somebody else, maybe it doesn't meet

4

that test.
MR. MANNING:

5

Well, we think that the Court

6

absolutely has to look at the statement as a whole and

7

make a determination of whether the entire statement is

8

actually in the declarant's penal interest.
QUESTION:

9

Do you say that if portions of the

10

statement don't meet that requirement of the rule,

11

the statement can be redacted and offered,

12

lesser version, or redacted version?

MR. MANNING:

No,

-- what the Court can do?
It would certainly be appropriate

kind of case would be a case where the other statement

25

would not be related, or would not be against the

1

declarant's penal interest, and let me give you an

2

example, if I may, of the distinction that we would draw

3

in this situation.

4

If the declarant says, Joe and I robbed the

5

bank, then that statement, the entire statement is against

6

the declarant's penal interest, because he has not only

7

admitted that he robbed a bank, he has admitted that he

8

has committed a conspiracy with Joe to rob the bank and
the entire statement would come in as being against his

10

11

penal interest.
Now, if he says, it's ironic, I robbed a bank

12

today, and Joe robbed a bank yesterday, well, the second

13

part of that statement would be excluded because it

14

wouldn't be related, it wouldn't be integral to his

15

description of his own offense, and that statement would

16

be redacted when the statement against penal interest was

17

submitted to the jury.

18

QUESTION:

Well, you -- I'm not sure I follow

1

you in your answer to Justice O'Connor's question about

20

the proper use of a redacted statement.

21

Williamson's trial, and you have a declaration from

22

Harris, and Harris says, in effect, what he said in this

23

case about Williamson, and the judge is supposed to admit

24

that on the issue of Williamson's guilt, although all

references to Williamson's name are stricken?

there is a statement that includes parts, some of which

have no relationship to the declarant's description of the

9

QUESTION:

Justice O'Connor I thought early

asked you -- earlier -- whether there would be some

MR. MANNING:

issue under the rule in this case, but we think there are

for this Court, and the reason --

Mr. Manning, isn't the most logical

would anyone say that there are reasonable assurances that

This

This is a situation where the declarant admitted

11

his full participation in a conspiracy to transport

12

approximately $10 million worth of cocaine from Florida to

13

Georgia for distribution.

14

Now, to be sure, he said that Williamson

15

arranged the acquisition, and that the delivery was to

16

Williamson, but he did not portray himself as a bit player

17

in this conspiracy, and the statements he made not only

conceded knowledge that the cocaine was in his trunk, and

than petitioner suggests.

is that against Harris' penal interest?

18

MR. MANNING:

Well, certainly in a case like

19

this, where you're describing your role in a conspiracy,

20

every detail that you give to the police helps to sink you

21

further. It is rare that you find a case where the

22

Government prosecutes somebody on the basis of a naked

23

confession.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. MANNING:

May I just ask one question?
Sure.

1

QUESTION:

In determining whether it's against

2

penal interest, it is not merely a kind of a schoolroom

3

textbook analysis of whether there's an additional element

4

of criminal liability, but also on the other side of the

5

balance is maybe he thought this would give him more

6

lenient treatment from the prosecutor because he was

7

cooperating with the police, and shouldn't that be

8

evaluated in determining whether the net value was against

9

his penal interest?

10

MR. MANNING:

That is certainly a factor for the

11

district court to consider in considering the totality of

12

the circumstances.

13

QUESTION:

And so if we have a case in which the

14

substantial motive for making the statement is to obtain

15

more lenient treatment, what ought the result to be?

16

MR. MANNING:

Well, again, it depends on what

17

other circumstances obtain.

If you take the example that

18

I gave of the guy admitting to a murder and implicating

19

someone else in the receipt of stolen goods, then that's a

20

situation where, even if the motive of the person was to

21

seek lenient treatment, you would have to think that his

22

self -incrimination in a capital crime of murder would

23

overcome any doubt about the accuracy of his statement

24

arising from his desire to curry favor by handing over the

25

person to whom he gave the stolen watch that he took off

1

of the murder victim.
Now, the most important point, though, that we

2

3

would like to make is that in any of these situations the

4

district court should be trusted to weigh the

5

circumstances.

6

evidence that the declarant made the statement with the

7

idea of currying favor or getting leniency from the

8

authorities in exchange for giving up a cohort.

It is absolutely relevant if there is

QUESTION:

But if the substantial motive is to

10

obtain leniency, it seems to me that that undercuts the

11

rationale of the rule.
The rationale of the rule is that you wouldn't

12

13

make this statement unless it were true if it's against

14

penal interest, but we're hypothesizing now a situation in

15

which the penal interest is irrelevant.

16

trying to do is to better your condition, is to obtain

17

leniency.

18

MR. MANNING:

What you are

If the district court finds, based

1

upon a preponderance of the evidence, that the statement

20

that the declarant made was in his penal interest in the

21

sense that he inculpated someone else in an effort to gain

22

leniency, then that certainly would be a finding that

23

should be sustained and it would be a proper application

24

of the rule.

25

Our point is that in making that determination,

1

the Court should not adopt a per se rule that places

2

talismanic significance on questions of custody or of

3

whether the declarant made the statement to the police.

4
5

QUESTION:

Well, I just want to make clear what

your position is.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Manning --

7

QUESTION:

If the predominant motive in making

8

the statement is to obtain leniency, is that a statement
against penal interest and therefore admissible?
MR. MANNING:

10

Again, I think that it's very

11

difficult to answer that question without knowing all of

12

the facts that surround the statement, but it would be a

13

factor - -

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Well, why is it against penal

interest if the dominant motive is to obtain leniency?
MR. MANNING:

Well, because if the dominant

17

motive is to obtain leniency, but the declarant makes a

18

statement that is very, very strongly against his penal

1

interest and the district court concludes that no one in

20

the declarant's position under all of the circumstances of

21

the case -- for example, he has admitted to a murder, and

22

his quest for leniency will gain him very little -- if the

23

district court in those circumstances makes the

24

determination that no reasonable person in the declarant's

25

circumstances would have made the statement unless

1

believing it to be true,

2

appropriately admit that sta-tement under Rule 804(b) (3) .

3

QUESTION:

then the district court would

Is the district court always well-

4

situated to determine what a person's dominant motive or

5

prevailing motive was in making a statement?

6

MR. MANNING:

Well,

the district court has to

7

consider all of the evidence that is submitted by the

8

Government and by the defendant in making the

9

determination.

We think that the district court is among

10

the various actors who could make that determination, the

11

best-situated.

12

QUESTION:

Why should we ask any factfinder

13

involved in this evidentiary -- to make a finding as to

14

what someone's dominant motive was?

15

MR. MANNING:

Well, because what the district

16

court has to -- the determination that the district court

17

has to make is whether a reasonable person in the

18

declarant's position would have a motive to fabricate his

19

confession, and in that sense the district court

20

inevitably is making an inquiry into what a reasonable

21

person in the declarant's position would be motivated by.

22

Now, one other point I would like to make is

23

that the chief justice had mentioned earlier the

24

possibility that the jury would be able to weigh the

25

various circumstances that surround the making of the
37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

statement, and I would like to reinforce that point by-

2

noting that under Rule 806 of the Federal Rules of

3

Evidence a declarant can be impeached as to a hearsay --

4

the credibility of a declarant can be impeached with

5

respect to a hearsay statement to the same extent as a

6

person making the same statement in court in live

7

testimony.
So not only is it possible for the jury to weigh

8

9

the evidence that is submitted pursuant to a hearsay

10

statement admitted under Rule 804(b)(3), but it's also

11

possible for the defense to impeach the declarant's

12

testimony under Rule 806, and bring out any bias or motive

13

or interest that the declarant might have had in making

14

this statement, including --

15

QUESTION:

16

But that's true with respect to any

hearsay, isn't it?
MR. MANNING:

17

That's true about any hearsay, and

18

the Court has relied on Rule 806 in holding that, for

19

example, coconspirator's statements can be admitted

20

pursuant to a firmly rooted hearsay exception, because it

21

mitigates the concern that surrounds the admission of

22

hearsay.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Manning, at least getting away

24

from the question of motive, you would at least -- I take

25

it you would admit that it would be a correct statement to

1

say that if the trial court reasonably reads the statement

2

as conferring a net benefit on its face as conferring a

3

net benefit upon the declarant, that it would be

4

inadmissible.

You agree to that, I take it.

MR. MANNING:

5

Well, I think we would, prefer to

6

put it in terms of the rule itself, that the district

7

court found that a reasonable person in the declarant's

8

position would make the statement even though he did not

9

believe it was true, that is, if he had some benefit,

10

something to gain by fabricating a statement, then

11

absolutely the district court would properly exclude that

12

evidence.

13

QUESTION:

Well, don't you always have something

14

to be gained by making a statement which is in effect net

15

in your favor?

16

MR. MANNING:

Well, I suppose if you put it that

17

way you would have something to gain if the statement were

18

net in your favor.

19

If the declarant gained a great deal by

20

inculpating someone else -- for example, a situation might

21

be if you had a defendant and the police said, we will cut

22

your sentence in half if you roll over on your cohort, and

23

the declarant said, fine, you know, I'll -- you know, I'll

24

give a statement, and then he refuses to testify, that

25

would be a situation -39

1

QUESTION:

But there, there --

2

MR. MANNING:

-- where it would be appropriate

3

for the district court to make the finding that a

4

reasonable person in those circumstances would have

5

fabricated the statement.
QUESTION:

6

There are certainly limits, though,

7

to which a reasonable person would go and simply casting

8

blame on someone else, if, you know, the police are going

9

to look into it and say, gee, this is just a bunch of bunk

10

you told us, I mean, a reasonable person isn't just going

11

to make perfectly wild statements in hope of getting some

12

sort of deal.

13

MR. MANNING:

Well, that's right, Your Honor,

14

and that's why it's important to give the district court

15

the latitude it needs to look at all the circumstances of

16

the case.

17

In fact, in this case, we think that a situation

18

like that occurred when Harris revised his statement at

19

6:00 p.m. in response to agent Walton's setting up a

20

controlled delivery.

21

As petitioner mentioned, earlier in the day,

22

Harris had made the statement that he had gotten the drugs

23

from a Cuban and that he was going to make a controlled

24

delivery to a dumpster in Atlanta at 10:30 p.m.

25

And then when Agent Walton questioned Harris at
40

SUITE 400

1

6:00 p.m. that evening, he finished his questioning, he

2

stood up to go make a controlled delivery, and Harris

3

stood up and said, I can't let you go through with it,

4

it's not true, what I told you is false, and he revised

5

his story, giving details about -- that petitioner was

6

driving in front of him in a rented Lincoln Continental

7

and he saw the arrest, and therefore there could be no

8

controlled delivery because petitioner knew that he --

9

that Harris had been arrested.

10

Now, those circumstances vouch for the

11

reliability of the statement that Harris made at that

12

point, because he would have been in much greater trouble

13

if he had fabricated them at that point.

14

The DEA could certainly have verified if

15

petitioner had a rented Lincoln Continental on the day

16

that Ha'rris said he did, and certainly if Harris was

17

fabricating there was a chance that petitioner would have

18

a credible alibi, and the Government could have gone

19

through with the controlled delivery, and if Harris had

20

been lying at that point he would have opened himself up

21

to charges of obstruction of justice, so --

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Manning, I assume that the

23

reasonable person referred to in the rule is a reasonable

24

person who has no compunction about lying, is that right?

MR. MANNING:

A reasonable person who doesn't mind

that a reasonable person calculating the advantage of

telling a lie would tell a lie in these circumstances.

But he's not under oath.

I don't like the implication anyway.

10

MR. MANNING:

11

QUESTION:

Neither do I.

Mr. Manning, could these statements

12

have come in anyway under the coconspirator exception, or

13

were they no longer made in furtherance of the conspiracy?

14

MR. MANNING:

Well, the district court initially

15

suggested that they would come in under the coconspirator

16

exception, but made no - -

17
18

QUESTION:

The prosecutor talked him out of

MR. MANNING:

The prosecutor did talk him out of

it, and we believe the conspiracy had probably terminated

21

at the time of the arrest, although in connection with

22

that, I'd like to use that to illustrate the fact that

it's important in all of these cases that in a variety of

the Federal Rules of Evidence and trust the district

courts to evaluate the totality of the circumstances.

In most cases, when someone is --

4

QUESTION:

Well, you do, but there has been a

lot of strong language in a number of this Court's cases,

6

a recent one being Lee v. Illinois, about the

7

untrustworthiness of this kind of statement.

8

to acknowledge that and deal with it.

9

MR. MANNING:

You do have

We do acknowledge that, and we

10

agree that in making an evaluation about the totality of

11

the circumstances and what a reasonable person in the

12

declarant's position would do when you're dealing with

13

somebody who is in police custody, the district court must

14

be sensitive to the pressures and to the circumstances

15

that would indicate whether the declarant in the

16

particular case had given up someone else in order to make

17

a deal or to get leniency.

18

QUESTION:

Don't you think that most of the time

19

the defendant -- or, pardon me, the declarant makes the

20

statement because he thinks it's in his net benefit?

21

MR. MANNING:

No, I don't think so.

I think

that often you have people who are confronted with having

been caught in a crime who make statements that are very

much against their penal interest.

2

traffic, and he asked Harris, may I search your trunk, and

3

Harris said yes, knowing that there were 19 kilograms of

4

cocaine in the trunk.

5

to the authorities that are against their penal interest,

6

and if they didn't we would very rarely catch criminals.

7

QUESTION:

People all the time make statements

Well, let me put it this way, then.

8

The penal interest rule that you're advocating rests on

9

the assumption that most of the time these statements are

10

made even though it is not to the defendant's net benefit,

11

as he understands it, to make them.
MR. MANNING:

12

And that's the very premise of the

13

longstanding exception for declarations against interest.

14

Almost as early as the hearsay rule itself developed, the

15

courts developed an exception for statements against

16

interest.

17

Statements against pecuniary interest and

18

proprietary interest were the first ones to develop, and

19

the supposition is that people don't say things against

20

their own interest if they are lying, and that gives --

21

23

QUESTION:

But doesn't the calculus change when

there are multiple defendants?
MR. MANNING:

The calculus may very well change

24

when there are multiple defendants, but the district court

25

is perfectly situated to evaluate all of the factors and

circumstances in determining whether the calculus has

2

changed in a way such that a reasonable person in the

3

declarant's position would fabricate his story in order to

4

gain advantage from the authorities.

5

I mean, our basic -- in all sorts of contexts,

6

we trust the district court to assess the probativeness of

7

evidence, and this Court has been very reluctant to

8

shackle district courts in the context of admitting

9

hearsay with per se rules that restrict their ability to

10

consider the whole picture in deciding whether something

11

fits within a hearsay exception.

12

In Bourjaily, the Court rejected a per se rule

13

forbidding district courts from considering hearsay

14

evidence in determining the admissibility of statements

15

pursuant to the coconspirator exception.

16

In Idaho v. Wright, the Court rejected a per se

17

rule that would prevent district courts from allowing the

18

introduction of hearsay that was made by a witness who was

19

unavailable because she was determined to be incompetent.

20

One of the purposes of the Confrontation Clause

21

and the principal purpose, we would submit, is to further

22

the truth-seeking function of the trial, and if

23

petitioner's view is accepted, a district court looking at

24

an array of circumstances, if confronted with the fact of

25

custody, will have to ignore every other fact, put on

We think that's contrary to the general approach
of this courts and the lower courts, the Federal Rules of
