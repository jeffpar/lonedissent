CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE ANN JONES PETERS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. PETERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this capital case, the State succeeded in

11

introducing evidence, over the defendant's objection, that

12

the defendant had already been sentenced to die by another

13

jury in an unrelated case.

14

The issue before this Court is whether that

15

evidence undermined the jury's sense of responsibility in

16

violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.

17

Capital juries are asked to decide on behalf of

18

the community whether a defendant should live or die at

19

the hands of the State.

20

decision, and one that this Court has recognized jurors

21

may seek to avoid.

22

in this case to discover that the decision had already

23

been made, that the community had already decided that

24

John Romano should die.

25

QUESTION:

This is a most agonizing

How relieved the jurors must have been

Do you think, Mrs. Peters, that would

make the jury in this case more likely or less likely to

2

itself impose the death sentence?
MS. PETERS:

3

I think that it would make it more

4

likely.

5

has argued, that one jury may give life because it felt

6

that its decision did not matter, a man can only be killed

7

one time.

8

the factor that he's already been sentenced to death, and

9

other juries give death because of that same factor, that

10

I think that there is a possibility, as the State

If a jury -- if one jury gives life because of

shows how arbitrary factor this is.
QUESTION:

11

That's not a --

You're not saying that the jury was

12

more likely to convict because of this second -- you're

13

saying it might have been more likely to convict, it might

14

have been less likely -- it was just kind of an aberrant

15

factor?
MS. PETERS:

16

To sentence to death, I think it

17

was more likely that it would affect its judgment to

18

sentence him to death.

19

the other jury had done.
QUESTION:

20

It would be more likely to do what

Well, why wouldn't it be just as

21

logical to say, if, as you say, juries shy away from this

22

responsibility, to say well, he's already been sentenced

23

to death?

24

give him life.

25

He's going to be executed anyway, we'll just

likely to do, it is not a principled distinction --

2

principled guiding factor to determine when death is

3

appropriate in a case and when it is not, whether the jury

4

returned life, or whether the jury returned death.

5

way, it's an unreliable verdict, because it was based on

6

an arbitrary factor rather than a determination that death

7

was appropriate for this case.

8

9

Either

Although the jury was not explicitly told in
this case that their decision did not matter, that message

10

was clearly communicated by the piece of evidence that

11

showed that he had already been sentenced to die.

12

the jury to believe that its decision does not matter

13

falsely deflates the solemnity of the decision-making

14

process and reduces the proceeding to a mere formality

15

both as to the defendant's eligibility for death as well

16

as the appropriateness of that decision.

17

QUESTION:

Leading

Ms. Peters, may I ask you the state

18

of the law in Oklahoma in this situation?

19

Oklahoma law, is the sentence in a previous case relevant

20

for the jury in the subsequent proceeding to be aware of?

That is correct.
But nevertheless felt it was not a

constitutional violation that the error was not harmful in

a constitutional sense?
MS. PETERS:

10

The Court of Criminal Appeals

recognized that it might have undermined the jury's sense

12

of responsibility, but then went on to say that it was

highly unlikely that it did so.

2

As I understand your reading of the Oklahoma, it

3

is that they found there was error, but that there was not

Federal constitutional error, is that correct?
In other words, the information shouldn't have

5
6

been conveyed, but it simply was not a due process

7

violation.
MS. PETERS:

8

9

I think that the court looked at it

as an Eighth Amendment error initially --

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. PETERS:

It did.
-- and said that it might undermine

12

the jury's sense of responsibility, and then analyzed it

13

in the Fourteenth Amendment instead.

14

had to review it with a heightened sense of scrutiny,

15

which is, of course, Eighth Amendment language, and then

16

they said that it did not deny him due process, which is

17

Fourth Amendment, so I'm not really clear what it was the

18

court - -

19

QUESTION:

They said that they

Do you -- but you also view their

20

opinion as not engaging in harmless error analysis in the

21

strict sense, at least with respect to the Eighth

22

Amendment violation.

23

MS. PETERS:

That's correct.

They did not say

24

that they were applying a harmless error analysis, and

25

they certainly did not use language that would indicate

QUESTION:

Highly unlikely does not exclude

What case or cases from our Court are

you relying on for your submission, Ms. Peters?
MS. PETERS:

Several cases.

Of course, all the

cases on reliability of evidence in this Court,

principally Caldwell, because --

9

QUESTION:

Caldwell requires, though, doesn't

it, if one takes the concurring opinion which made the

11

Court -- that the information be misleading or false?

MS. PETERS:

information was misleading and inaccurate.

In this case, I believe the

The person had not previously been

He had been previously sentenced to

death, and as a historical fact it was correct.

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. PETERS:

Then what was false about it?
What was false about it was that it

20

was an invalid conviction.

21

of death was presented to the jury, the State had only

22

recently obtained the conviction and it had not yet been

23

subjected to appellate review.

2

that both had to vacated, and it was remanded for a new

3

trial, so the sentence of death that they heard about,

4

although it was true as a historical fact, it was not a

5

valid conviction.
QUESTION:

6

Well, what if it had been a valid --

7

what if the sentence had been upheld on appeal, would you

8

still be making the same arguments here?
MS. PETERS:

I would, because I also believe

10

that the evidence was misleading.

of the Court subscribed to that view.

You're saying it's not limited to being

reasons.

You don't challenge the factual

accuracy of that transcript, do you?
MS. PETERS:

I think a juror could have read this

The factual accuracy of that

document?
QUESTION:

12

Yeah.

Did it purport to be a

13

recitation of something that had happened at the

14

sentencing proceeding?

16

MS. PETERS:
in the document.

17
18
19

I think it was mere formal language

QUESTION:

It didn't purport to be a recitation,

then?
MS. PETERS:

No.

Even if the evidence was not

20

misleading or inaccurate, which I believe it was both, it

21

still was irrelevant to any State valid penalogical

22

concern that the defendant had --

23

QUESTION:

So you're saying that a State could

24

not conclude that the sentencing process is enhanced by

having this information, that as a matter of law it can

I think it would have the opposite

I think that it would -QUESTION:

So you're saying that as a matter of

law a State may not conclude that under any circumstances?
MS. PETERS:

Yes, unless the State can show a

valid State penalogical interest.
QUESTION:

I cannot think of one.

Unless the State -- I didn't hear

that last remark.
MS. PETERS:

Unless the State can show that

11

there's a valid State penalogical interest in showing the

12

death penalty, that I cannot think of one at the moment.

13

QUESTION:

So you are really arguing for a clear

14

position that the jury may not be informed of an

15

outstanding death sentence.

16

MS. PETERS:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

That is correct.
Well, can't a jury be informed in the

sentencing proceeding of a prior conviction?
MS. PETERS:

Certainly.

Prior convictions are

20

relevant to a concern of the jury, whether he is a threat

21

to society, for example, but --

22

QUESTION:

But you're saying that then the jury

23

could have been informed if this sentence had not -- had

24

been upheld, it could have been informed that he had been

25

convicted, but he couldn't have been informed of the

sentence which was imposed on him?

2

MS. PETERS:

3

QUESTION:

That is correct.
What if the crime had been convicted

4

after the prior sentence had been imposed, and it was

5

relevant under the law of, say, an aggravating factor, or

6

what-not, that the individual had committed the later

7

felony following receipt of a sentence of death?

8

the fact of the sentence be introduced under those

Could

circumstances?
MS. PETERS:

10
11

I think that would certainly

present a much closer question that we have here.

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. PETERS:

What would the answer be?
I'm not sure what the answer would

14

be.

15

that would -- the State would have an arguably valid State

16

penalogical interest.

There would be competing interests there, because

17

QUESTION:

I think the important thing -I thought your position in answer to

18

my question was, your theory is it will give the jury a

1

diminished sense of responsibility in every case to know

20

that another jury has already returned a death sentence,

21

and that there are no circumstances in which it would be

22

proper?

23

MS. PETERS:

I said that I could think of none,

24

and maybe this would present a circumstance that would be

25

proper, but there would be the competing interest of

1

which -- is it more probative, or is it more prejudicial,

2

and that I think is a much closer question than we have

3

presented in this case.

4

QUESTION:

How would that affect your earlier

5

argument that a jury is going to have a diminished sense

6

of responsibility?

7

MS. PETERS:

That's the prejudicial impact of

8

that evidence, is that it would diminish the jury's sense

9

of responsibility.

They would believe that their decision

10

did not matter.

11

they would believe --

12

A man can only be killed one time, so

QUESTION:

Why is your answer different in

13

response to Justice Souter's hypothetical?

14

difference does it make what order the crimes -- the order

15

in which the crimes were committed?

16

MS. PETERS:

What

What I was about to say in this

17

case the crime that he got the death penalty for was

18

committed 9 months or so after the crime that he was on

19

trial for at this time.

20

If a defendant kills in prison, that, I think,

21

is the heart of that aggravating circumstance if the State

22

elected to have one, that he killed while in prison or

23

under a sentence of death.

24

that society cannot be protected by the man.

The important thing there is

He has been

1

I think there is certainly a way to get that

2

concern before the jury without the prejudicial impact of

3

undermining their sense of responsibility by telling them

4

that he's already been sentenced to death.

5

QUESTION:

Ms. Peters, in Caldwell, as I recall,

6

it wasn't only inaccurate, what was told to the jury, but

7

it was intentionally inaccurate.

8

misleading.

9

prosecutor, isn't that right?

It was a misleading statement by the

10

MS. PETERS:

11

QUESTION:

12

That's correct.
And there's no contention of any

misleading in this trial, is there?

13
14

I mean, it was

MS. PETERS:

I believe it was misleading,

because it --

15

QUESTION:

Well, you say it turned out that the

16

perfectly accurate statement later became inaccurate,

17

because the conviction was set aside, but at the time it

18

was said it was perfectly accurate.

19

MS. PETERS:

Accurate, but misleading, because

20

it led the jury to believe that its decision did not

21

matter.

22

QUESTION:

Well, let's talk about that.

Suppose

23

evidence comes out during a trial that is misleading.

24

that a basis for reversing even the conviction, never mind

MS. PETERS:

2

QUESTION:

If it
Where the prosecutor hasn't been

3

responsible for it, but the defendant can come in and

4

show, what this witness testified to was misleading, and

5

indeed it was misleading, is that a basis for setting

6

aside a conviction?

7

MS. PETERS:

If it did not mislead the -- I

8

mean, if it did not undermine the sense of responsibility,

9

possibly not, but if we have both of those factors, yes, I

10
11

believe it is.
QUESTION:

Never mind the sense of

12

responsibility for what the sentence is, it could have

13

misled the jury as to the conviction, as to whether the

14

person's guilty or not, but if the prosecutor has not been

15

responsible for that, is that a basis for reversing the

16

conviction?

MS. PETERS:

If it renders the verdict

unreliable, yes, it would be, even -QUESTION:

Do you have a case for that?

That's

20

extraordinary.

21

than we do now, if any misleading evidence is a basis for

22

overturning a conviction.

23

We would have many more appeals up here

MS. PETERS:

Not if any misleading, but if

24

there's a reasonable likelihood that the verdict was so

25

infected that it's unreliable, I think that it would be.

QUESTION:

What case supports that proposition?

2

QUESTION:

Well --

3

MS. PETERS:

4

QUESTION:

I do not have a case on that.
I don't think it's true.

We would

5

have endless appeals if that were the case, and if that's

6

not the case with respect to guilt or innocence, I find it

7

hard to understand why perfectly innocent misleading

8

should provide an automatic appeal with respect to the

9

sentence, either.
MS. PETERS:

10

In this case, I do not think it was

11

perfectly innocent on the part of the prosecutor.

12

prosecutor did need to show the jury that John Romano had

13

been previously convicted of a murder, that defense

14

counsel stipulated to that fact.
To get the document in was of no help.

15

The

Once it

16

was stipulated to, there was no question for the jury.

17

The only reason that the State introduced the document as

18

well would be to get this inflammatory information before

19

the jury.

20

The Court of Criminal Appeals held that the

21

sentence of death was not relevant to the jury's

22

consideration, and all lower courts that have considered

23

this have agreed, with one exception, that being

Even the

relevant to a State concern.

argued in their brief is that it is arguably relevant to

show the seriousness of the crime.

4

QUESTION:

The most that the State has

Ms. Peters, the way misleading

5

evidence is usually entered in these other contexts, in

6

the context of a trial, is that counsel is supposed to be

7

able to counteract it.

8

jury, this is misleading.

9

have said that.

If it's misleading, he tells the
I assume counsel here could

Did counsel try to tell the jury, yes,

10

there is a conviction -- the jury was told it was on

11

appeal, wasn't it?

12

MS. PETERS:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct.
The jury knew that.

Counsel was free

14

to say, as you've been told, it's on appeal.

15

reversed on appeal, so you should not assume that this

16

individual will be put to death.

17

MS. PETERS:

It may be

It prevents the arbitrary factor,

only two possible punishments for first degree murder, and

that was life imprisonment, or a death sentence.

MS. BLALOCK:

That's the way they reasoned.
That was exactly their reasoning

as to the Eighth Amendment, the Caldwell violation.

That was - -

It's a fairly narrow reading of

Caldwell.
MS. BLALOCK:

9

Well, in this case I believe that

10

they were correct in holding that Caldwell didn't apply.

11

The jury --no one ever indicated or hinted to the jury

12

that they were not the final decisionmakers as to the

13

defendant's death sentence in this case.

14

never told them that, the trial court certainly never told

15

them that, in fact they did the opposite.

16

The jury instructions emphasized to the jury

17

that the decision was up to them, there was certainly no

18

prosecutorial misconduct or any bad faith action on behalf

19

of the State or the trial court in seeking to undermine

20

the jury's responsibility in rendering a sentence in this

21

case.

22

Although I believe that the Court of Criminal

23

Appeals was certainly correct in their analysis under the

24

Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment and held that this was not

25

a Federal constitutional violation, going back to my

earlier point, I don't think that they had to determine

2

that the evidence was irrelevant, I think that they could

have determined that the evidence was relevant.

4

that another State could find under their evidentiary

rules that this sort of evidence was relevant.
QUESTION:

7

Is there any --do you have any cases

that have found this kind of evidence relevant?
MS. BLALOCK:

I think

The ones that we've cited in our

brief, and I believe there is -- the primary one is out of

10

Pennsylvania.

Most of the cases that have dealt with this

11

type of evidence have been cases in which the jury not

12

through the admission of evidence but through the

13

newspapers, the media, or through their own common

14

knowledge had some knowledge that the defendant had a

15

prior death sentence.

16

defendant had a prior death sentence that had been vacated

17

or had a valid outstanding prior death sentence.
QUESTION:

18

Some of them knew that the

I was going to ask about that.

I

19

take it that under the petitioner's submission, if a juror

20

had such knowledge that would be a ground to excuse for

cause?

petitioner's position.

MS. BLALOCK:

I would take it that would have to be the

Yes, I would think so.

Accepting

petitioner's argument at face value, I don't think I'm

stretching petitioner's argument in saying that any time a

juror has knowledge defendant has a prior death sentence,

2

then a fair trial is not possible and a reversal will have

3

to result.

4

QUESTION:

Of course, here the instruction came

5

from the court, which gives it added importance, I

6

suppose, and added -- courts don't usually instruct on

7

irrelevant matters.

8
9

MS. BLALOCK:

The evidence came in the -- the

knowledge of the prior death sentence came in the form of

10

evidence in the judgment and sentence.

11

didn't refer to it except to emphasize to the jury that it

12

was not final and that it was on appeal.

13

The trial court

Pardon me.

If there are no further questions, then in

14

conclusion, I would like to reiterate to this Court our

15

position that the Court of Criminal Appeals was correct in

16

their determination of whether or not there is a Federal

17

constitutional violation, and they were correct in their

18

analysis of the effect of the prior death sentence in the

19

context of this case.

20

I would also like to remind you that in this

21

particular case, I realize that what we're primarily

22

concerned with is setting down guidelines or determining

23

for future cases what the effect of this evidence is, or

24

if this evidence should be admitted at all, but in this

25

case, the Court of Criminal Appeals had to engage in a

reweighing analysis because the prior violent felony
conviction aggravating circumstance fell.
They then considered, as this Court has held
that they may, the remaining aggravating circumstances,
and considered all the mitigating evidence that was
presented on behalf of the defendant and held that the
best sentence was still the appropriate sentence.

Their

decision is on page 66 of the Joint Appendix.
So certainly in this case there's absolutely no
question that that judgment and sentence that reflected
that the defendant already had a death sentence could have
affected his verdict, could have affected the sentence of
death in this case at all, based on what the Court of
Criminal Appeals had to do.
Thank you.

MS. PETERS:

May it please the Court:

Mrs. Blalock has argued that - - said that the
jury was never told that the verdict was not up to them.
I would submit that this piece of evidence, like a
picture, was worth a thousand words.

be explicitly told that their decision did not matter.
There's reason in this record, as well as the

Well, that makes me - -

QUESTION:

-- they're not relevant but they're

highly prejudicial, that's what you're --

MS. PETERS:

I'm saying that the death sentence

was highly prejudicial, and that that evidences what might

have happened in this case.

10

The Court of Criminal

Appeals --

11

QUESTION:

Of course, that third conviction

12

might have been the only one that was on a Tuesday, too.

13

That might have been the reason.

MS. PETERS:

QUESTION:

Also, on - You really don't know.

saying that post hoc, therefore, right, that was the

17

reason.

18

Maybe not.

19

You don't know that that's the reason.

MS. PETERS:

Maybe.

Certainly, but we know that the

20

only difference in what the jury heard was evidence of the

21

death sentence.

22

When the Court of Criminal Appeals reviewed this

23

case and reweighed, as I said before, they relied on an

24

instruction that was not given, and they presumed the

jury's verdict to be correct, so they gave -- they relied

on findings made by this jury, but if this jury's

sentencing responsibility was undermined, its findings of

aggravating factors were also affected and could not be

It's difficult to imagine what evidence could be

more prejudicial to a capital defendant than the fact that
