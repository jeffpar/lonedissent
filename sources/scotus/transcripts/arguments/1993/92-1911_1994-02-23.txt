ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD E. SHAPIRO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the

20

supreme court of Washington.

21

quantities for fish habitat at the proposed Elkhorn

22

hydroelectric project on the Dosewallips River.

23

project is subject to licensing under part 1 of the

24

Federal Power Act.

25

It concerns streamflow

1

of water in cubic feet per second that may be diverted by

2

the hydroelectric project, and the quantity that must

3

continue to flow in the stream.

4

Now, the use of streamflow to generate

5

electricity is at the core of the licensing scheme for

6

hydroelectric projects in part 1 of the Federal Power Act.

7

The question here is whether streamflow quantities at the

8

proposed project are to be determined by the Federal

9

Energy Regulatory Commission under the broadly balanced

10

public interest considerations in part 1 of the Federal

11

Power Act, or by conditions imposed in State

12

certifications under section 401 of the Federal Clean

13

Water Act.

14

If Washington had attempted to impose the

15

challenged streamflow conditions independently of the

16

Federal statute, its action would have been preempted by

17

the Federal Power Act under this Court's decisions in

18

California v. FERC, decided in 1990, and in First Iowa

19

Hydroelectric Cooperative v. FPC, decided in 1946.

20

So another way of stating the question here is

21

whether section 401 of the Clean Water Act shields a

22

State's attempt to regulate streamflow quantities at a

23

hydroelectric project from preemption by part 1 of the

24

Federal Power Act.

25

State section 401 certification are outside of the scope

If the certification conditions in the

1

2

of section 401, then there is no shielding effect.
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, wouldn't a decision as

3

to preemption be premature here, since the Commission

4

hasn't yet acted on the application for a license?

5

MR. SHAPIRO:

No, Your Honor, it would not.

The

6

reason is that the process here calls for the

7

certification to be issued as a condition precedent to the

8

issuance of a license.

9

Water Act, the conditions in the certification become

10
11

Under section 401(d) of the Clean

conditions in the license, so that -QUESTION:

The Commission is not capable, then,

12

of saying that the amount of water set aside in the

13

certificate is not consistent with the project we have in

14

mind and therefore we're going to change it?

15

MR. SHAPIRO:

That is correct, Your Honor, and

16

this point was quite correctly recognized by the supreme

17

court of Washington at petitioner's appendix page 16a,

18

where it pointed out the very thing I have said, that FERC

19

has to comply with the certification condition regardless

20

of its legality.

21

Now, the case they relied on -- U.S. Department

22

of Interior v. FERC -- was a case that involved a

23

challenge by the State of West Virginia to licenses issued

24

on the Ohio River, and in that case West Virginia said

25

that the State of Washing -- the State of West Virginia

1

said that FERC was encroaching on its section 401

2

conditions.

3

In its decision, FERC said no, we cannot impose

4

different conditions, we will comply with what the State

5

says in its certification, and that case was -- the D.C.

6

Circuit's decision in that case was based upon an

7

acceptance of the FERC's representations that it was

8

bound.

9

Now, the United States in its amicus brief has

10

suggested the possibility of a conflict, but I don't see

11

how that can happen under the law as it is structured,

12

since neither FERC nor any Federal court can review an

13

initial section 401 certification.

14

to come up under the Federal statute, to be sure, but

15

through the State court system.

16

QUESTION:

The entire process has

And certainly the consultation

17

process that the Federal Power Commission, now FERC, is

18

supposed to engage in with the State authorities before

19

determining -- before issuing the license and before

20

determining what the proper flow is in order to preserve

21

fish habitat and so forth, that consultation process

22

becomes rather superfluous if the State has a trump card.

23

MR. SHAPIRO:

That is exactly right, and that is

24

really the essence of our argument that in effect we have

25

a kind of a reversal of the preemption process.

If a State puts in a condition that's outside of

1
2

its 401 authority, that condition still must be included

3

in the license.

4

gets to the point of undertaking its responsibilities

5

under section 10(j) of the Federal Power Act.

FERC cannot review it, and FERC never

Section 10 (j) was enacted in 1 46, and it said

6

7

that the State -- recommendations of State fish and

8

wildlife agencies as well as Federal fish and wildlife
agencies must be accepted as the basis for any conditions

10

to protect fish and wildlife that the FERC includes in its

11

license, unless it makes very specific findings after

12

attempting to reconcile its differences with the State's

13

or Federal wildlife agencies that the conditions are

14

inconsistent with the purposes and requirements of the

15

Federal Power Act.

16

So what we have here is a situation in which the

17

States can completely circumvent that process simply by

18

imposing conditions in the 401 certification.

1

that happened in this case, in a related case as one of

20

the amici have pointed out at some length.

In fact,

Having - - I think we should turn immediately to

21
22

the language of section 401 of the act, because it's

23

fairly forthright.

24

page 134a.

25

It appears in petitioner's appendix at

There are two things that are quite apparent

1

from that language.

First, the certification process,

2

which is a delegation of Federal authority to the State,

3

is one that not only makes the certification a condition

4

precedent to the Federal license, but it also -- under

5

section 401, the statute clearly distinguishes between

6

certifications by the States and the licensing process.

7

It doesn't transfer the licensing process to the State.

8

Thus, the fundamental balancing process FERC is supposed

9

to undertake remains in effect.
Now, the second -- and this is an important

10
11

point about section 401 -- is that the State's delegated

12

authority is limited by the text to certifying whether any

13

discharge from the licensed activity complies with the

14

applicable water quality provisions that are specifically

15

enumerated in section 401(a).

16

So States aren't authorized to regulate the

17

activity itself -- that is, to regulate the hydropower

18

project.

19

hydropower project.

20

They are to regulate discharges from the

Now, among the enumerated provisions

21

specifically listed is section 303 of the Clean Water Act.

22

Section 303 relates to water quality standards.

MR. SHAPIRO:

25

What's the code number?
I believe it is 1313, Your Honor.

We have set it out in the appendix.

QUESTION:

1

You experts in the area always use

2

the statute number, which makes those of us who only

3

occasionally visit the field confused.

4

MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, Your Honor, and it is 1313 of

5

33 U.S. Code, and you will find the beginning at page

6

114a.

7

about to turn to specifically is section c on page 116a

8

and 117a, and what I would say very briefly about that is

It's a very long section, but the section which I'm

that that defines what constitutes a water quality
10

standard.

A water quality standard, according to section

11

303(c) (2)

on page 117a of the petition -- it's 2a - - says

12

that "A revised or new water quality standard shall

13

consist of the designated uses..."

Mr. Shapiro?

1

water quality criteria for such waters based upon such

2

uses."

3

That requirement for both a designation of uses

4

and water quality criteria to protect those uses becomes

5

quite significant to the first basis for the holding of

6

the Washington supreme court.

7

the court below and in this Court, that water quality

8

standards applied in a 401 certification are limited to

9

pollution and discharges as opposed to streamflow levels.

1

State include certain upstream flow requirements because

2

they believe, or they have taken the position that they

3

are necessary to preserve, among other things, the

4

fisheries, and therefore that's the reason that they may

5

object and hence fail to certify the discharge, because

6

the discharge is being made at the expense of the

7

violation of an upstream standard that this State is

8

entitled under this section, subsection (C), to establish.

9

Is that an unsound argument?
MR. SHAPIRO:

10

Yes, Your Honor, for this reason.

11

Your Honor has stated quite correctly that the discharge

12

must comply with the State's water quality standards as

13

approved by EPA, but the water quality standard has two

14

elements.

15

this case happens to include fish habitat.

It must consist of the designated use, which in

Yes.

17

MR. SHAPIRO:

criteria to protect that use.

use alone is insufficient.

one in which all that's necessary to make a water quality

standard is a designated use.

3

the statute referring to criteria to protect that use

drops out of the statute.

to enact it, they could simply say, just designate a use

At that point the phrase in

the statute would not -- is not being properly applied

here.

Your Honor mentioned in your hypothetical a

12

kinds of water allocations, proprietary and

13

nonproprietary.

14

California was a nonproprietary allocation of water

15

designed to - - the allocation was intended to preserve

16

fish and wildlife habitat.

17

but that nonappropriated allocation is still a water -- is

18

still an allocation of water quantity.

1

If we accept a use designation, or I

suppose if we accept a nondegradation requirement as being

a water quality standard sufficient to justify a

argument, is that correct?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Honor.

Our contention is that this statute, and section

provides that water quality allocations are outside the

11

scope of the act.

QUESTION:

Could you give me the code number?

13

QUESTION:

Well, is it 1370?

14

MR. SHAPIRO:

I believe it is 1370, Your Honor.

We have reproduced it in our brief at -- I'm sorry to

refer you to so many documents --at page 7, footnote 3.

17

It's in the blue brief at page 7, footnote 3, and we've

18

set out two provisions, section 510, which is 33 U.S.C.

19

1370, and section 101(g).

20

The history of that water quality -- water

21

quantity exclusion is that when water quantity issues were

22

first raised in the Congress, when the first water quality

standards act was considered by Congress in 1965, Senator

24

Muskie said expressly to the western delegations who had

That line was reconfirmed in 1972, when section

to the act in 1977 because of concerns that the line was

being broken.

9

that is being federalized under this statute.

10

Senator Wallops proposed an amendment that

That was

the purpose of it.
Because the statute requires State water quality

11
12

standards to meet EPA requirements -- the EPA administers

13

substantial portions of it, the Corps of Engineers

14

administers substantial portions of it -- the effect of

15

these provisions was to leave the State's authority over

water quality -- water quantity allocations exactly where

they would have been had there been no Clean Water Act.

The central question before this Court then is, can

2

Washington State enforce all of its water quality-

3

standards including its antidegradation policy by

4

protecting those existing uses by setting a minimum

5

instream flow or is Washington State limited only to its

criteria and the amount of water that may be in that

stream at the end of the construction of the project.
QUESTION:

it has been long held to have meant an antidegradation

policy.

4

QUESTION:

Well, it certainly means

5

antidegradation insofar as the quality of the water may

6

cause a degradation of the use, but does it include

7

degradation where the quality of the water is constant, or

8

even higher?

10

But the volume of the water, being lesser,

GENERAL GREGOIRE:

Your Honor, very clearly EPA

11

has said that antidegradation policy is intended to

12

protect the existing use -- here, salmon and steelhead.

13

QUESTION:

Well, of course it is, but does it do

14

so only by regulating quality?

15

whether it does so only by regulating quality, or also by

16

regulating, or permitting the State to regulate volume?

What we have --

What's the textual basis for the

GENERAL GREGOIRE:

10

Well, again, if you look at

11

1987 amendments by Congress, what they said very clearly

12

there in amending section 303 of the Clean Water Act is

13

that they had long meant "maintain" to mean the

consistent with the antidegradation policy.

QUESTION:

Well, what do you mean when you say,

in a sense you agree?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, because this Court's

11

decision in Escondido points out that whilst FERC must

12

recite such a condition in the license that it issues, it

13

can also explain any basis it has for disagreeing with

14

that condition, and in a lengthy footnote explain that

15

FERC could then take the position in court that that

condition is not a proper one in light of its statutory

responsibilities under the Federal Power Act, and I'm

18

referring to footnote 20 on page --at 466 U.S., page 778.

19

In the Escondido case which we cite toward the

20

end of our brief, this Court dealt with a similar

21

certification required from the Secretary of the Interior

22

when the hydropower project was to go on an Indian

disagrees with the substance of the condition, but

When the case was before the Pollution

It wasn't until we got to the supreme court of

Washington that we got to antidegradation policy, which

came back into the case as a part of the water quality

Now, antidegradation policy -- it's all

15

what the 1987 amendments refer to, the antidegradation

16

policy established under this section.

17

quite simply, that if it's established under section 303,

18

it has to comply with the requirements of section 303, and

It's the --

-- that the uses are just the means

of determining what the criteria ought to be.

That's correct.

If you concede that both uses and

because you're not allowing this use to continue,

MR. SHAPIRO:

I think that is an accurate

statement of the State's position.

18

the phrase in section 303(c) about uses and criteria is

conjunctive, and Congress didn't intend there to be uses

it also says in the second sentence of section 101(a) that

these goals are to be achieved consistent with the

provisions of this act.

6

The implementation of that goal is what the

fight has been about for nearly 20 years in shaping the

Water Act has to be read, particularly when you're dealing

10

with the delegations to the States in section 401, in

accordance with the limitations that Congress has

provided, otherwise the act turns into something
