CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. FARR:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The Government defends the must-carry law

11
12

primarily by analogy to the antitrust laws, saying that it

13

protects the broadcast system from anticompetitive actions

14

by cable operators, but there is a critical flaw in this

15

argument.

The law does not just prohibit anticompetitive

16

activity.

It prohibits all decisions not to carry

17

broadcast stations for whatever reason the cable operator

18

may choose.

19

Thus, we submit, the Government must put forth

20

an interest to justify what the law actually does, which

21

is to override all editorial discretion with regard to

22

carriage of broadcast stations, and we further submit that

23

neither interest put forward by the Government can meet

24

that burden.

25

First, an interest in promoting particular

1

programming does not meet the burden, because Government

2

can't generally promote speech that it favors by the means

3

of ordering others to carry it, or by discriminating

4

against disfavored speech, and the interest in protecting

5

the economic viability of the broadcast system as a whole

6

does not support the law, because even without must-carry,

7

cable systems carry the vast majority of broadcast

8

stations, and the broadcast system is concededly thriving.
QUESTION:

9

Well, Mr. Farr, there is -- we have a

10

situation where one medium has a limited number of

11

channels, and does the Government have no interest at all

12

in seeing that those channels are opened up - -

13

MR. FARR:

I think the Government --

14

QUESTION:

-- to others on a neutral basis, for

MR. FARR:

Justice O'Connor, I think the

15
16

example?

17

Government has an interest in seeing that cable operators

18

like other businesses, including like other members of the

19

press, do not make decisions about what to carry on an

20

anticompetitive basis, and if the law was narrowly

21

directed to that problem, then it seems to me the case

22

would be different, but the law is not.

23

QUESTION:

For instance, the dissenting judge on

24

the panel below suggested an alternative way that the

25

Government might proceed.

Would you like to comment on

1

that suggestion?
MR. FARR:

2

Justice O'Connor, I don't completely

3

agree with Judge Williams on the idea that least access

4

channels are a less restrictive alternative for two

5

reasons, even though, quite frankly, it is in one sense a

6

helpful argument to us.
The first is that even least access doesn't

7
8

require any showing of anticompetitive behavior by the

9

cable operators.

It is again a law that is directed to

10

all cable operators and simply removes discretion from

11

those operators to program particular channels, whether

12

they've ever engaged in any economic misconduct or not.

13

QUESTION:

What if a municipality chose or

14

perhaps, if the Federal Government had the power, the

15

Federal Government chose to say that all cable operators

16

must be merely carriers?

17

to put copper under our streets in order to carry their

18

own programs.

We're not going to allow anybody

MR. FARR:

Although I wouldn't concede it, I

23

suppose it is possible that at one time that is something

24

that could have been considered, but now we have a system

25

with operating cable systems which -5

But why is that any different from

Justice O'Connor's least access proposal?

is unconstitutional there?
MR. FARR:

It is not unconstitutional for

14

telephone companies, because they are not essentially

15

engaged in the business of providing news, information,

16

speech of that nature to the public.

17

It

QUESTION:

But does that sort of define the

18

problem in a way that makes it easier for you?

19

illegitimate to look at the operating companies simply as

20

carriers as opposed to originators, and say that in one

21

respect, i.e. their respect as carriers, they are subject

22

to obligations the way the phone company might be?

23

MR. FARR:

Why is it

What -- it seems to me that the

24

particular activity that the must-carry law is aimed at is

25

choice of material to be carried on a cable system.

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

The

1

cable operator has a choice of a number of different

2

sources from which it can obtain programming, including,

3

as you suggest, Justice Souter, creating its own

4

programming, and what the must-carry law deliberately aims

5

at doing is saying when you make that choice you must make

6

it in a way that the Government directly controls, and not

7

because the Government is saying you're engaging in some

8

anticompetitive behavior, simply because the Government

9

wants you to make a different choice.

10

QUESTION:

Of course, the significance of that,

11

in a way, is easy if we use the terms like editorial

12

discretion, which have taken on a meaning from the

13

newspaper context, but this doesn't quite fit the

14

newspaper context.

15

I suppose the position that the carrier is in

16

here, the operating company is in here, is somewhere in

17

between that of the newspaper and the telephone company,

18

and how should we decide whether the significance of a

19

limitation on editorial discretion should be analyzed as

20

if it were a newspaper, or on the other hand as if we were

21

looking at it as an analogue to the phone company?

22

MR. FARR:

Well, it seems to me that 1) the term

23

editorial discretion means a particular thing.

24

that a business which is engaged in providing speech to

25

the public, and the Court has recognized that that's what

It means

cable systems do, is in fact making decisions about what
material it would be, whether it is public television
stations, alternative to public television stations -QUESTION:

But Mr. Farr, they're not making

particular decisions.

If they're carrying a program or

they're carrying a broadcaster, they're not deciding what
that broadcaster -- each individual program.

They're

making a gross decision.
MR. FARR:

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg,

they are not deciding each moment of the day what is put
on a particular channel.

That is something that the

programmer itself does.
QUESTION:

I think one of the briefs suggested a

better term would be an entrepreneurial decision rather
than an editorial - MR. FARR:

Well, Your Honor, to begin with, the

term "editorial discretion" is a term that this Court has
used in Preferred and other cases with respect to what the
cable operators are doing, so I'm not simply creating it
out of thin air, but I think it is an entrepreneurial
decision in the sense that any member of the media who is
choosing speech is choosing it in part, at least, for
entrepreneurial reasons.
The question is, what, in fact, do the
subscribers to a cable system, the readers to a newspaper,

the patrons of a bookstore or a movie theater -- what will

2

interest them?

3

pay money to see or hear?

4

w

What will they come to see, what will they

QUESTION:

But that's essentially an economic

decision, not a literary or choice one.
MR. FARR:

Well, it's a combination of the two.

7

It seems to me that any member of the media can make

8

decisions, and to say, for example, that we are simply

9

going to say that you are making a decision for an

10

economic reason, if a newspaper decides that it's going to

11

carry a particular political cartoonist because that

12

political cartoonist is popular and that will increase

13

circulation, that may be entirely a business decision, but

14

that's certainly something we don't think the Government

15

can step in a preempt.

16

So the -- indeed, this goes very much to the

17

point that I'm trying to make, which is it seems to me

18

that Government does have a legitimate interest in saying,

19

when you are acting in a way that we typically prohibit

20

under the antitrust laws, the laws that regulate

21

competition, then when we tell you that you can't exercise

22

your discretion for that reason in order to injure

23

somebody anticompetitively, then we have the power to

24

impose some regulation.

25

But when Government goes further and says, we're

1

going to control all of your decision-making with respect

2

to a particular subject, whether you're acting

3

anticompetitively or not, then it seems to me to have

4

crossed a very important line.
QUESTION:

5

Well, of course, I guess we can argue

6

about Judge Williams' solution if and when it's ever

7

adopted.

8

that's feasible or not, do you.

I suppose you really don't have to fight whether
I mean, what's happened

here is that the Government has not said you must make
10

your channels available to everybody.

They've said, you

11

must make your channels available to this person.

12

MR. FARR:

Well, that's correct.

13

QUESTION:

So it isn't really the same thing as

14

what's done with the telephone company.

15

MR. FARR:

That is correct.

16

QUESTION:

I think Justice O'Connor's question

17

was whether, in your -- based on your argument, least

18

access -- least access would be equally unconstitutional.

1

You're arguing that must-carry is unconstitutional.

20

least access, as a substitute for it, also be

21

unconstitutional?

22

MR. FARR:

Would

I think that is a closer question,

23

and let me explain why.

The difficulty that I have with

24

least access from the standpoint of cable systems is that,

25

like the must-carry law, it does take away the discretion
10

to program particular channels, and as I mentioned before,
it doesn't do that based on any determination that there
is anticompetitive activity.

It simply makes the decision

that we are going to preempt the programming for those
channels.
What it does not have is the element of pure
discrimination against particular programmers and in favor
of other programmers, so in that sense it does not have
one of the evils that the must-carry law has.
QUESTION:

Can you explain one thing to me,

because I think it was the nub of the answer that you just
gave, and that is, Judge Williams relied very heavily in
his opinion on the fact that the FCC requires certain
elements of content in local programming, and therefore a
fortiori it is required by must-carry.
Would your argument then equate must-carry with
least access if the Government stopped regulating -through the FCC stopped regulating the content of local
programming?

Would they then be on par?

MR. FARR:

I would not put them specifically on

a par, because I think it still is a particular
discrimination in favor of identified speakers, and I
think it would be illusory, frankly, to assume that
Government is not generally aware of what speech on
broadcast station consists of.

Indeed, even apart from

1

particular regulation by the FCC, there are specific laws

2

that Congress has enacted that deal with programming on

3

broadcast stations, so I would still have concern --

4

QUESTION:

But they deal with programming on all

5

broadcast stations, so that your identification of the

6

speaker would be purely geographic at that point, wouldn't

7

it?

8

MR. FARR:

In the sense that --

9

QUESTION:

I mean, i.e., locally.

The only way

10

you would identify them would be their point of origin

11

rather than anything to do with their content, let alone

12

their prescribed content.

13

MR. FARR:

Well, for example, if I understand

14

the question, Justice Souter, a law that says that a

15

broadcast station cannot have indecent material, let's

16

say, that is a law that applies to broadcast stations

17

throughout the country, so Congress could know that if

18

it's expressing a preference for broadcast stations, that

19

it is therefore at the same time really expressing a

20

preference for stations that are subject to that law and

21

that restriction on their speech in ways that other

22

possible programmers would not be.

23

QUESTION:

That would distinguish -- I guess

24

this is my point of ignorance.

25

between cable and broadcast, the cable operators could be

indecent?
MR. FARR:

They are not subject to some of the

3

same restrictions on their speech that broadcast stations

4

are, and I think that is because they do not share the

5

physical -- the spectrum and the physical scarcity

6

rationale has not been applied to them.

7

not done that.

8

9

QUESTION:

The Congress has

Mr. Farr, if a municipality is

reviewing bids for a cable company, and let's assume

10

economically there can probably be only one cable company,

11

I take it it's entitled to assess the cultural offerings

12

of the different programs from the different bidders?

13

MR. FARR:

Well, I am not sure that I would give

14

them much leeway in that regard, quite honestly.

15

I think if what Government is doing is essentially trying

16

to use a franchising process where there is perfectly

17

adequate room for other cable operators to function,

18

because there's plenty of space on the rights of way for

19

additional lines or additional cable, if Government is

20

using that process as a way to start to press for

21

distinctions in speech, then I find that troubling.

22

I mean,

Now, I think it's probably unrealistic to assume

23

that when local governments are considering applications,

24

that they don't take into account something on the grounds

25

of content, but my general feeling is that that should be
13

1

at a very, very attenuated level if it's permitted at all.
QUESTION:

2

Well, Mr. Farr, let's suppose that a

3

municipality decides, we don't want our telephone poles

4

cluttered with a lot of things, so we're only going to be

5

able to have one cable television within the -- and there

6

are three or four applicants.

7

to make some judgment as to at least which the majority of

8

the people in the municipality might prefer?

9
10

MR. FARR:

Now, aren't they entitled

Assuming the premise, I think it is

possible that there is some very modest leeway for that.

11

QUESTION:

Well, why should it be modest?

12

MR. FARR:

Well, because -- first of all because

13

I do quarrel with the premise, quite honestly.

When --

14

QUESTION:

Well, accept the premise, though.

15

MR. FARR:

But I think the premise is important,

16

too, and I mean -- I will accept it, but I think the

17

premise is important to it, because the question that one

18

is always asking when one is extending Government leeway

19

to get into content is, why are we allowing Government to

20

do this?

21

Typically, Government is not allowed to do it,

22

so if the answer is, because we have no choice,

23

essentially Government is in a position, as it is in the

24

broadcasting situation, where there is a spectrum which

25

can only accommodate so many speakers, and the Government

w?

1

therefore has to shut down other speakers, has to silence

2

particular speech, then the Government has been accorded

3

some greater leeway with respect to the speech that gets

4

on.

5

That really doesn't exist with cable operators,

6

and therefore it seems to me if the local government says,

7

we're only going to have one cable system, something which

8

I point out Congress has now prohibited in the 1992 act,

9

but if they say that, really they're using one power, the

10

power to grant rights of way, to essentially leverage

11

themselves into a second power to control content, and I

12

do find that troubling.

13

QUESTION:

So you say if there are 10 cable

14

companies that apply, and the municipality says, we only

15

want one, the First Amendment says no, you have to take

16

all 10, no matter how cluttered the streets get?

17

MR. FARR:

No, no, I would not suggest that

18

cities have that obligation to allow all-comers to come

19

in.

20

Court - -

I mean, essentially that's the issue that the

21

QUESTION:

Yes, but okay, well --

22

MR. FARR:

-- had before it in Preferred.

23

QUESTION:

-- you have a number of observations

24

around the fringe, but how about the actual situation

25

where you have several applicants, the city says we're

only going to take one?
MR. FARR:

When the city says that, and there is

no absolute requirement that the city has to take one in
the sense that it could easily accommodate others, then it
seems to me the city's power to discriminate on the basis
of content is very limited, if it exists at all.
QUESTION:

So 10 applicants, the city says we're

only going to take one, the applicants could make out a
case that physically with a lot of cluttering you might be
able to take three or four, the city can do nothing, it
has to take all 10?
MR. FARR:
take all 10.

No, no, I'm not saying that it has to

I'm saying that its basis for choosing among

them cannot be dictated by its views about the content of
programming.
If, for example, they say, we will accept -- we
will give preference in the application process to cable
operators who agree that they will not show the following
25 cable networks, they will go into an upper tier if they
agree not to show these, I think that would be
impermissible.
QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, to what extent is the

scarcity rationale undercut by current technology?

I

guess we have now coming on line satellite services that
will provide hundreds of channels with a tiny dish - 16

scarcity.

MR. FARR:

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.

QUESTION:

-- available so there would be no

We have fiberoptics coming on line, and they

have virtually unlimited capacity.

Does this undercut the

scarcity rationale, in your view?
MR. FARR:

Well, I think it changes part of it.

I think what clearly is happening in the communications
world is there are a number of new technologies, which
means that the opportunities for those who want to reach
the public are greatly increasing, and I think they're
going to accelerate in the next 10 or 15 years.
In the particular scarcity rationale, really the
only scarcity rationale that this Court has recognized,
deals with one specific thing, which is the
electromagnetic spectrum, and the limitations on assigning
licenses based on frequencies in the spectrum, that
spectrum is not really changing, so in that sense there
still is physical scarcity.
It would seem to me that the difficult question
in the broadcast context, none of which, I hasten to point
out, applies to cable, is, even if you still have scarcity
of the spectrum, given all the other ways that people can
reach the public through other technologies, is the
regulation that has been premised on the scarcity still
justified, and it seems to me that is the question that

argument that many cable companies have, say, only 30-odd

5

channels now, and one of the reasons you say you don't

6

want to be forced to carry is that you then have to give

7

up something.

8

favored position that you're required to give to

9

broadcasters, but if there's not going to be any limit on

Now, I can understand your point about the

10

the number of channels that you can have, doesn't that

11

dilute your objection?

12

MR. FARR:

It's possible in the future, Justice

13

Ginsburg, there may be a situation where essentially the

14

ability of all programmers to reach the public through a

15

cable system is essentially not foreclosed by a law like

16

the must-carry law, but I would have a couple of comments.

17

First of all, obviously we're not at that position now.

18

The must-carry law applies today, and nobody disputes the

19

fact that most cable systems have a definitely defined

20

capacity which is already filled up, and therefore any

21

inclusion of broadcast stations necessarily means the

22

exclusion of some other programmer.

23

Secondly, of course, the hard thing to speculate

24

about is, if at a time when the average cable system has

25

200 channels, it may be that there are 400 programming

1

services, because programming services have expanded to

2

meet the expansion in channel capacity of cable systems as

3

that has occurred, so I think it's hard to say, even in

4

the abstract, that in the future when there are more

5

channels, that a preference for a particular kind of

6

programming imposed on operators will not be troublesome,

7

because there still may be the same need to make

8

choices --

9

QUESTION:

How many - -

10

MR. FARR:

-- just in larger numbers.

11

QUESTION:

What is the maximum number of local

12

channels that realistically a cable company might be

13

compelled to carry?

14

MR. FARR:

I don't have a precise answer to

that.

17

I think we're talking somewhere in the 15 to 20

QUESTION:

If there are that many local stations

that want to be -- that would request access.

19

MR. FARR:

That's correct.

20

QUESTION:

Because in most markets there

21
22

wouldn't be that many.
MR. FARR:

That many stations total?

You have

23

VHF stations, you have UHF stations, if that doesn't fill

24

up your number, then you have low power which you're

25

required to carry as well, so the number actually does

1

fill up fairly quickly, so I think it is basically

2

correct, although I can't say this with absolute

3

assurance, that most cable systems subject to must-carry

4

are finding that, through the combination of stations that

5

are being carried through retransmission consent, and

6

those carried pursuant to must-carry, they are filling up

7

their limit.
QUESTION:

8

9

Based on what we've said so far, I

assume that the must-carry provision for public

10

broadcasting is the most vulnerable based on the content

11

argument, is that correct?
MR. FARR:

12

I think that -- certainly there are

13

specific findings, Justice Kennedy, about the public

14

television station's content, although there are still

15

findings of a slightly less specific nature about the

16

commercial stations, so frankly I don't make much

17

distinction between the two.
QUESTION:

18

Well, if we assume for the moment

19

that it's the most vulnerable, and if we assume also for

20

the moment -- there can be a debate about it, but if you

21

assume that that's the most justifiable provision from the

22

standpoint of improving our young people's intellectual

23

life, does that mean there's something wrong with our

24

doctrine?

25

MR. FARR:

Well, I don't think so.

It seems to

1

me that the doctrine permits choices by cable operators,

2

and there is no reason to expect, based on history, that

3

in fact cable operators aren't interested in providing

4

programming that people want to see anyway.

5

operators voluntarily, without must-carry, since 1986,

6

when the rules were struck down, have carried the vast

7

majority of stations.

8

9

Most cable

I mean, 95 to 98 percent -- as an affidavit that
we submitted in the Joint Appendix at page 305 suggests,

10

98 percent of the stations have been voluntarily carried,

11

including public television stations.

12

is in fact a demand.

13

programming on public television stations that the public

14

wants and the one thing it seems to me that is clear is

15

that cable systems have the primary incentive to provide

16

programming that the subscribers want, rather than

17

incentives to drop broadcast stations for other reasons.

18

QUESTION:

Why?

Because there

There is a certain kind of

To the extent that's true, aren't you

19

saying the must-carry rules just -- largely just make the

20

cable companies carry what they'd carry anyway?

MR. FARR:

I think that's correct, in a sense,

QUESTION:

So maybe the fight isn't quite as

serious as it sounds on the surface.
MR. FARR:

Well, it's serious in one sense.

I

mean, if we're saying that this is going to dramatically
change the face of television, whether must-carry stands
or doesn't stand, I don't think it will, for exactly the
reason that I'm saying.
On the other hands, I do think there is a very
real difference between a voluntary decision to utter
speech, to use the term in First Amendment language, and
being compelled to do so, and I assume that, for example,
most people voluntarily say the Pledge of Allegiance, but
I think then when Government says, even if you would
voluntarily say it, or even if most people would
voluntarily say it, we're going to make it a matter of
compulsion, then they have crossed over into an area of
unconstitutionality.
QUESTION:

Mr. Farr, as I understand your

argument this morning, you pretty much are saying that
even if we accept all the congressional findings, you
should prevail on the theory you've been advancing.
MR. FARR:

That would be true, that this law is

not tailored to anticompetitive activity, and it is based
specifically on discrimination among different
programmers, and that itself is enough to make the law
invalid.
QUESTION:

What if we agree with you, Congress

goes back, drops all the findings about content and the

value of local origination, and simply sticks to findings

2

about the threat to competition?

3

MR. FARR:

Well, the problem is, simply making

4

findings about the threat to competition, even if they

5

were better substantiated than these findings, which show

6

that in fact the stations are being carried, they're not

7

being dropped in order to get advertising revenues, more

8

broadcast stations are in fact carried on cable systems

9

now than when there was must-carry.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

Congress just says, look, we want to

lock the door before the horse has gone.
MR. FARR:

But the difficulty that they would

13

not cure by simply going back and simply reenacting the

14

same law with anticompetitive findings is the point that I

15

made precisely at the outset.

16

specifically at anticompetitive conduct.

17

tailored to that problem.

This is not a law directed

18

So as long as the law reaches all decision­

19

making with respect to broadcast stations, not simply

20

decision-making for anticompetitive reasons, it doesn't

21

make any difference what findings Congress makes, it is

22

not justifying the law on that basis.

23

I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

GENERAL DAYS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
What Mr. Farr wants the Court to do is basically

6

ignore significant elements of the congressional decision

7

to enact the 1992 law.

8

with conviction about the regulation of electronic media

9

in the United States.

At least two things can be said

First, the Federal Government made

10

a promise to the American public in 1934 that it would

11

make available so far as possible to all the people of the

12

United States a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide and

13

worldwide wire and radio communications service, and it

14

expected that the administrative agency charged with

15

promoting that policy would do so consistent with public

16

interest, convenience, or necessity, and do so in a way

17

that was fair, efficient, and equitable.

-“V.

^

18

Second, the electronic media field has been from

19

its beginning, to quote Justice Frankfurter in the 1943

20

National Broadcasting Company case, "a field of enterprise

21

the dominant characteristic of which was the rapid pace of

22

its unfolding."

electronic media and increased outlets for expression

while on the other assuring the growth of the electronic

We respectfully submit that the lower court

correctly upheld the constitutionality of the must-carry

12

provisions of the 1992 act, finding it essentially

economic regulation designed to create competitive balance

in the video industry as a whole.

Do you acknowledge the legal

principle that to be valid it must be content-neutral?
GENERAL DAYS:

I think that if it is not

that this Court has set out, but our position is that this

7

regulation is not content-based.

It is not focused --

I was just trying to ascertain

whether you take the position or acknowledge that it must

that the regulation meet a higher standard of

19

why it was our argument on this particular legislation

20

that the existing tools for evaluating it were really not

21

adequate to the task, and that it was more productive not

22

to look at the so-called content related cases or

doctrines, but rather to look at those regulations, or

GENERAL DAYS:

Are you saying, based on your

there really is no difference in the authority of the

Government vis-a-vis cable and, on the other hand, radio

broadcasting, radio and television broadcasters?

GENERAL DAYS:

QUESTION:

We are not - -

In other words, could the Government,

if it wished, have a fairness doctrine, have an equal time

doctrine, have a decent speech regulation with respect to

cable operators and programmers as it does for radio and

15

television broadcasting?

16

GENERAL DAYS:

That is not our position, Justice

Ginsburg.

18

to suggest that Congress necessarily has the power to

19

regulate cable television in the same way that it does

implicate but do not transgress First Amendment

3

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, certainly that argument was

made.

6

were other ways in which Tornillo could express his views

and be heard.

8

I don't think the Court actually resolved the

QUESTION:

Well, do you think the case would

have come out differently if he could have shown as a

10

matter of fact that there was nothing nearly as adequate

11

as publishing his letter to the editor in the Miami Herald

12

to express his views to the public?

13

GENERAL DAYS:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think that

14

saying that there was nothing quite so adequate is not

15

analogous to this situation.

16

was basically a bottleneck, a control, a gatekeeper

17

function that cable was performing with respect to the

18

development of broadcast television.

19

What Congress was looking at

I think that in the Tornillo case what we would

20

have to have is a situation where the only way in which

21

Tornillo could express himself was through the Miami

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, Justice Scalia, certainly

11

that argument can be made.

12

again, to divorce the history of Congress' consideration

of cable television from what it did in 1992 is to miss

as we're talking about Congress' commitment that I just

mentioned to the American people to ensure that they were

able to get free television service.

It has nothing to do with the

content, then?

11

GENERAL DAYS:

12

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Well, that's a difficult argument to

13

make in light of the findings that place such stress on

14

the desirability of public television and local

15

broadcasting and discussing local issues and so forth.

16

think it's very difficult to sustain that argument.

17

GENERAL DAYS:

I

Justice O'Connor, it in our view

18

is not difficult.

19

in the sense that there is nothing, in our estimation,

20

constitutionally improper or inappropriate for Congress to

21

express its views on the importance of local

22

broadcasting -- it's something that it's been doing since

23

1934 -- or to talk about educational television.

It may be different, but not difficult,

basis, then, and set aside a third of a whole medium for

the benefit of a favored class of speakers, so it's a

2

little difficult to justify that --

3

GENERAL DAYS:

4

QUESTION:

5

GENERAL DAYS:

Well, Your Honor --

-- on existing doctrine.
I think the point is that it's

6

not favoring the broadcast industry in the sense of

7

promoting it plain and simple.
The idea is to make broadcast television

8

9

available to 40 percent of those households that do not

10

have cable, and also to make certain that people who have

11

cable get the quality of programming that they deserve,

12

and to the extent that the cable industry, with its

13

tremendous horizontal concentration, vertical

14

concentration, tremendous control over the market present,

15

what Congress envisioned was, down the line before long,

16

there would not be that availability, and that's why

17

Congress responded.

18

QUESTION:

Yes, but Congress responded -- I

19

mean, it seems to me the point of Justice O'Connor's

20

question is, Congress responded by explaining why the

21

content of local programming and educational television

22

programming was more desirable, or was in itself

23

desirable.

24
25

They were putting a content justification on it,
and I don't know how you get over that hurdle except

1

perhaps by saying, look, the motives were mixed, or on the

2

other hand we have a justification that will avail us even

3

though there is a content basis, but it's still the case

4

that they have made the decision and have explained the

5

decision on a content basis, haven't they?

6

GENERAL DAYS:

Justice Souter, certainly there

7

were all kinds of statements and findings, but I think

8

they go to the point of diversity.

9

saying, now, we're going to allow local stations on cable,

10

It was not Congress

we're going to allow educational stations on cable --

QUESTION:

Sure, but whenever --

12

GENERAL DAYS:

-- and we're going to watch to

13

make certain that you do precisely what you expected.

14

That was not what Congress had in mind.

15

QUESTION:

But whenever you get a particular

16

content which is not otherwise being broadcast, your

17

justification is always diversity.

18

it, or push someone else aside to allow it in, we will not

19

have diversity to that extent.

If we don't require

20

I don't see the difference between a diversity

21

argument and a content argument here, and in any event I

22

don't see how you could make that distinction so long as

23

the Government through the FCC does regulate the content

24

to some degree of the broadcast medium.

1

this was perhaps a way in which Congress could control the

2

cable TV industry, but I think this Court's decisions have

3

made very clear that the editorial discretion of even

broadcasters is fairly broad, and the FCC and the Congress

are restricted in the way they go about regulating that

about this administration's views on the so-called super

highway, information super highway, and the position of

this administration has been that there be open access and

of the questions that were put to Mr. Farr.

about the capacity of stations, how many local stations

I think that's

very high.

11

12

there are 15 stations, there's bound to be some

13

duplication.

14

For one thing, the act recognizes that there

Congress also found that 9,000 of the 11,000

15

cable operators had unused capacity, and just to pick up

16

in closing on the questions about a municipality and

17

whether it could make decisions about which cable operator

18

to carry, based in part on programming, Mr. Farr gave a

19

very modest response by suggesting modest regulations, but

20

I think the fact is that what this case presents, as do

21

those hypotheticals, is a situation where economic

22

regulation, where the need to ensure that the best service

23

is provided to a community, comes into the decision-making

24

process.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR, III

4

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

5

MR. FARR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

6

I would just like to briefly address, if I may,

7

a few of the points of the economic theory on which the

8

Government is relying.
First of all, I could not emphasize more

10

strongly that this is not a law that is tailored to the

11

economic problem that the Government is talking about.

12

It's the problem set out at findings 15 and 16 at 6 and 7

13

of the Joint Appendix, which is that cable operators will

14

drop popular programming in order to divert advertising

15

revenues.

16

That's the theory on which it is based.
But the law does not prohibit cable operators

17

from dropping broadcast stations for that reason.

18

prohibits them from dropping them for any reason, however

1

protected that might be in First Amendment Terms.

20

It

But second, if one looks at this practice which

21

the Government has identified and the supposed threat to

22

the local broadcast system, which is what is predicted in

23

finding 16, there are two immediate problems *with it.

24
25

First of all, as I have said, 7 years of
experience without must carry show that in fact cable

1

operators drop very few broadcast stations, and of course,

2

even the numbers that are shown by the Government don't

3

reflect the fact that cable operators also drop cable

4

stations.

5

on, so many cable programmers have been dropped during

6

this period, too, from particular stations.

7

They're changing their programming as time goes

But in addition to that they carry virtually all

8

stations.

They carry the most popular stations, which are

9

their greatest competitors for advertising revenues.

The

10

FTC staff study that we lodged with the Court last week

11

shows that, of the stations that are dropped, they either

12

don't compete for advertising because they're public TV

13

stations, or in fact they are very little watched, so they

14

are very weak competitors for advertising.

15

And overall the number of stations carried on

16

broadcast systems has gone up, and Congress clearly

17

expects this to continue, because in section 6, the

18

retransmission consent provision, it gave broadcast

19

stations the right to demand payment for carriage, so

20

obviously the incentive to carry popular programming for

21

subscribers, where most of the money comes from, is much

22

greater than any incentive to drop stations in order to

23

get advertising revenues.

24
25

I'd like to make two other brief points.

First

of all, there has been discussion about the term, content47
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

related, and I would simply like to say, I think it's

2

important to recognize that this has two different

3

meanings, both of which are implicated in this case.

4

This law is content - related in one sense because

5

it specifically dictates the kind of programming, or at

6

least who provides the programming that is seen on

7

somebody's television screen, so it is putting this

8

programming on instead of this programming, the programmer

9

who is knocked off.

10

Second, the reason it's doing that is also

11

content-based, because Congress, as the findings suggest,

12

has a preference for local programming, for the kind of

13

programming seen on public TV stations specifically.
