ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD C. DuMONT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. DuMONT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In adjudications under the Black Lung Benefits

12

Act and the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation

13

Act, the Department of Labor and the courts have long

14

applied an evidentiary tie breaker known as the "true

15

doubt" rule.

16

understanding the proper outcome of this case:

17

"true doubt" rule is, where it comes from, and why its

18

application does not contravene the Administrative

19

Procedure Act.

20

There are three points fundamental to
what the

First, it's important to understand what the

21

"true doubt" rule does and does not say.

the adjudication of contested benefit claims.

24

prior conditions are met.

employer, must have adduced substantial, competent

2

evidence to support the position that that party is taking

3

in the adjudication.

4

have evaluated the evidence and concluded that the

5

evidence produced on each side is equally probative.

6

those rare circumstances of evidentiary equipoise, the

7

"true doubt" rule intervenes to direct that judgment be

8

rendered for the claimant.

QUESTION:

And second, the trier of fact must

How rare is rare, Mr. DuMont?

In

One of

the amicus briefs says it seems to happen all the time.
MR. DuMONT:

11

Well, I think that we can see that

12

it doesn't happen all the time from the fact that, as the

13

statistics quoted in our brief point out, under current

14

law, black lung claimants are successful in achieving

15

benefits only in about 7 percent of the cases.

16

the "true doubt" rule were being applied all the time, one

17

would assume that it would be somewhere between 50 and 100

18

percent.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

Now, if

What percentage of those 7 percent

are "true doubt" cases, do you know?
MR. DuMONT:

Those are the cases -- well, we

22

don't know.

Presumably, less than all of them, so that in

23

even a smaller percentage is the "true doubt" rule

24

determinative of the outcome.

25

cases the rule is recited, or it may be in some cases that

1

the rule determines one issue but it does not determine

2

the outcome, because there are various cases where a

3

claimant prevails on one issue because of the "true doubt"

4

rule but another issue goes in favor of the employer.

5

QUESTION:

Was --go ahead.

6

QUESTION:

Well, I'm just pursuing that.

One

7

ALJ seems to have found "true doubt" in four cases in one

8

year, complete equipoise of the evidence, which one would

9

think would be extraordinary.

10

MR. DuMONT:

Well, we think that in some of

11

these cases there are reasons why the ALJ -- particular

12

reasons why the ALJ's may find equipoise more commonly

13

than normal, particularly because you often have cases

14

such as the early cases under the Longshore Act or the

15

Maher case here, where there's a complicated question of

16

medical causation, you have respectable medical opinions

17

on both sides of the issue.

18

QUESTION:

In some cases the ALJ --

Do you have figures for the rarity

19

under the Longshore Workers' Act comparable to the Black

20

Lung Benefits?

Is it the same?

21

MR. DuMONT:

There are no comparable compiled or

22

published statistics.

23

that the "true doubt" rule is involved in approximately 7

24

or 8 percent of Longshore cases, so the figure would be

25

comparable to that extent.

The Department of Labor informs us

3

QUESTION:

Well, and that is your definition of

very rare, 7 or 8 percent of the cases.
MR. DuMONT:

Well, we would simply point out

4

that it's not being applied across the board and

5

indiscriminately by ALJ's to avoid their responsibility to

6

evaluate the evidence and to reach conclusions as to which

7

party has produced preponderance, where one party or the

8

other has produced a preponderance.

9

We think that the evidence is generally to the

10

effect that the ALJ's take their responsibility very

11

seriously, and that the Benefits Review Board and the

12

courts of appeals, in turn, take their responsibility

13

seriously to review those judgments and to make sure that

14

in cases where this rule is applied, one can fairly say

15

that the fact finder was not able to determine that one

16

side had produced a preponderance.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. DuMont, what is the standard of

18

review of the ALJ on whether or not it was correct to say

19

the evidence was in equipoise?

20

MR. DuMONT:

Both the Benefits Review Board and

21

the court of appeals apply a substantial evidence standard

22

of review, in general, to ALJ decisions.

23

they would apply the same standard of review that a court

24

would normally apply on any ultimate finding of fact,

25

which is to say they will be deferential to the resolution

And in this case

1

2

of factual issues by the fact finder.
QUESTION:

Does that mean that, as a practical

3

matter, if the ALJ says there's equipoise and there is

4

some evidence on both sides, that that will be accepted?

5

MR. DuMONT:

Not always.

It does mean that in

6

many cases -- in a case where it's appropriate to apply

7

the rule, it is probable that any one of three decisions

8

would be upheld;

9

decision that the evidence is in equipoise and therefore

10
11

decision in favor of either party or

that the doubt goes to the claimant.
But it's important to point out that both the

12

Benefits Review Board and the courts of appeals have

13

reversed decisions below applying the "true doubt" rule,

14

on the ground that as in any other ultimate finding of

15

fact, the trier of fact was simply out of line in

16

concluding that the evidence was in equipoise or favored

17

one party or the other.

18

Now, the last thing I'd like to point out about

19

the "true doubt" rule and how it applies is that it

20

never - it's important to understand this.

21

permits a claimant to be awarded benefits without having

22

produced evidence, substantial evidence to support his

23

entitlement under the statute in the regulations.

24

never denies the employer a full and fair opportunity to

25

meet that evidence and to establish that benefits should

under the statutory criteria.

The "true doubt" rule grows out of a long

3

tradition of adjudication by the courts primarily under

4

the Longshore Act.

5

passed in 1927, with the district courts primarily the

6

forum for litigation.

7

Circuit, in the F. H. McGraw v. Lowe case, upheld an

8

administrative decision on facts remarkably similar to

9

those in the Maher Terminals case.

You will recall that that Act was

As long ago as 1944, the Second

In other words, in

10

that case a worker had sustained a head injury at work,

11

developed Parkinson's disease, and the question was

12

whether causation could be shown or inferred.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

And there was no reliance there, I

take it, on any administrative regulation.
MR. DuMONT:

There was no regulation.

But what

16

there was was an administrative finding by the agency, by

17

the deputy commissioner, that the evidence was essentially

18

in equipoise, that he couldn't tell from the respectable

19

medical opinions in front of him which was the better

20

scientific answer, and that therefore, as a matter of

21

administrative policy, the doubt should be resolved in

22

favor of the claimant because of the remedial purposes of

23

the Act and because the risk of error should be placed on

24

the party best able to bear it.

So the court of appeals simply upheld

MR. DuMONT:

QUESTION:

MR. DuMONT:

QUESTION:

6

That's correct.
Under what legislation was this?
That was under the Longshore Act.
And who was the suit against,

it was

against an employer?

7

MR. DuMONT:

The suit was by an employer against

8

the deputy commissioner who had rendered the decision

9

granting benefits.

10

The controversy was between an

employee and the employer.
QUESTION:

11

But the pocket was not the

12

Government's pocket; it was an employer's pocket in that

case.

1

I know there's a wide variety of

State rules on these issues, and I'm not aware of whether

any State imposes a rule comparable to the "true doubt"

rule.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. DuMONT:

Thank you.
The decision announced in -- or the

7

principle announced in F. H. McGraw v. Lowe, this tieÂ­

8

breaking principle resolving doubts in favor of a claimant

9

in doubtful cases, continued to be announced consistently

10

by the courts of appeals in reviewing Longshore Act cases,

11

and it continues to be applied in such cases today.
QUESTION:

12

Excuse me.

Was it court of appeal?

13

I thought you said the Secretary had established the

14

principle.

15

simply accept the Secretary's enunciation of it?

16

Did the court of appeal establish it or did it

MR. DuMONT:

In F. H. McGraw v. Lowe there was

17

an administrative enunciation that was accepted by the

18

court of appeals and ratified by the court of appeals.

19

QUESTION:

Right, okay.

So the courts didn't

develop this.

21

telling us that the courts had accepted it.

22

It was developed by the Agency, and you're

MR. DuMONT:

It's not entirely clear where

announced that there -- it was principle frequently

1

articulated by the courts, is the way they put it, that

2

doubt shall be resolved in favor of the claimant.

3

that was partly a statutory principle in the early cases

4

interpreting the statute, that the statute should be

5

construed favorably to the award of benefits, but it was

6

naturally adapted to the context of resolving factual

7

disputes when those made a difference to the outcome.

8

10

QUESTION:

Now,

Don't some people attribute it to the

D.C. Circuit back in 1932?
MR. DuMONT:

Well, there's the Burris case back

11

in 1932, and that was certainly one of the early cases

12

that announced the principle that, in terms of statutory

13

interpretation, benefits should -- the benefit of the

14

doubt should go to the claimant, that's correct.

15

In the early 1970's the Congress changed the

16

adjudication structure and brought in the Benefits Review

17

Board as a part of the Department of Labor, to do the

18

initial level of review of these cases.

19

Review Board continued the courts' general policy and they

20

refined it into the narrow and clearly articulated rule

21

that was applied in these cases and is before the Court

22

today, that in cases of evidentiary equipoise, the

23

claimant should receive the benefit of the doubt on

24

factual issues.

The Benefits

718.403 of 20 CFR, which says that the burden of proving a

2

fact alleged in connection with any provision of this part

3

shall rest with the party making the allegation?

4

theory that that is a general statement and that's

5

superseded by the more specific provisions of 718.3(c)?
MR. DuMONT:

6

Is your

Well, that is one way of reading

7

it.

But, in fact, the Secretary interprets the burden of

8

proving language in the 403 regulation as imposing only a

9

burden of going forward, not a burden of persuasion.

In

10

much the same way, this Court has interpreted the same or

11

closely similar language in the Administrative Procedure

12

Act, in section 7(c), to refer only to a burden of

13

production and not a burden of persuasion.

14

QUESTION:

It's odd to talk about the burden of

15

going forward in the context of burden of proving effect.

16

That's a very odd use for a phrase that's intended to

17

apply simply to the burden of going forward.

18

MR. DuMONT:

I will admit that it seems a little

19

odd until, frankly, you start reading some of the cases in

20

this area and the legislative history of the

21

Administrative Procedure Act, and you realize that the

22

terms "burden of proving" and "burden of proof" are used

23

quite loosely, and they quite often are used in contexts

24

where it's not clear or not necessary to distinguish

25

whether one is talking about the burden of persuasion or

the burden of production.

2

The APA is probably the best example.

3

uses the term "burden of proof" in section 7(c), but this

4

Court has clearly held, and held correctly, that in light

5

of the legislative history of section 7(c), that term

6

refers only to a burden of going forward.

7

9

QUESTION:

We didn't hold that.

The APA

We said it in a

footnote in a dictum, didn't we?
MR. DuMONT:

Well, respectfully, I would say

10

it's not dictum, because if it were -- if the Court had

11

not held that, it would have had to go on to consider the

12

issue raised by the employer in that case, that regardless

13

of the administrative policies under the Labor Board's

14

interpretation, the Administrative Procedure Act, of its

15

own force, required that the general counsel bear the

16

burden on all issues in adjudication.

17

QUESTION:

You don't think we could follow a

18

rule of general application that law is not made in

19

footnotes, that holdings are not stated in footnotes?

20

MR. DuMONT:

Well, I can say that I think we

21

would feel very reluctant to ignore a flat statement, even

22

in a footnote, in one of this Court's opinion.

23

QUESTION:

But if it's so important, why is it

essential -- the reason it's important is because the

2

Court decided that it was not essential to reach that

3

issue in Transportation Management.

4

QUESTION:

Well, then -- but then doesn't your

5

argument that it was a holding fall apart, if it wasn't

6

essential?

7

MR. DuMONT:

No.

Because the reason it was not

8

necessary to reach that issue in Transportation Management

9

was because the term "burden of proof" in section 7(c) was

10

construed to mean burden of production, and not

11

persuasion.

12

of persuasion, or thought that there was a serious issue

13

there, it would have really had to evaluate -- give it a

14

full-dress evaluation, because otherwise the employer

15

would have had quite a substantial claim.

QUESTION:

It seems to me that to draw something

out of what is the third sentence in a footnote and say

20

simply the fact that the Court has said that before.

2

party initiating the proceeding has the general burden of

coming forward, but that other parties who are proponents

of some different result also, for that purpose, have a

burden to maintain."
And we think that that makes it quite clear that

what Congress had in mind in using this language was a

burden of coming forward, and a burden of coming forward

9

that applies to every party, including an agency in a case

where there's only an agency and, say, someone seeking a

license.
QUESTION:

12

But does that language suggest that

13

that's all that it means?

14

when you speak of who has the burden of proof, that the

15

normal meaning of that is not burden of persuasion?

MR. DuMONT:

1

Well, I will simply point out that

2

if you interpret -- if one interprets it to mean burden of

3

production, as the D.C. Circuit did -- and this is

4

something the D.C. Circuit pointed out -- then it is

5

perfectly consistent to say that both parties, all parties

6

in the litigation have the same burden, which is what the

legislative history says.

burden of persuasion, that's incoherent, because only one

party in any proceeding can have the burden of persuasion

2

What kind of a restriction is that on the agencies?

3

none at all.

4

MR. DuMONT:

5

QUESTION:

It's

Well -I find that so extraordinary, to

think that Congress is going to go to the trouble of

establishing a preponderance rule and say anybody in the

8

world can be given the burden of carrying the

9

preponderance.
MR. DuMONT:

10

Well, with respect, I don't think

11

that's correct.

12

what Congress was particularly getting at when they passed

13

the APA, in the substantial evidence portions, was to try

14

to make sure that there was substantial evidence in the

15

record to support any decision that was rendered by an

16

Agency, to get away from a sort of scintilla standard that

17

some courts had applied before in upholding agency

decisions.

If you look at the legislative history,

Now, they did that by saying, look, there must

This Court, in Steadman, did say that no

22

external consideration of equity could supervene to

23

require an agency to carry a higher burden of proof than

24

the preponderance of the evidence under section 7(c).

25

That's what Steadman really stands for.

But even taking

1

it to say that section 7(c) in the third sentence imposes

2

a preponderance standard as the norm in all APA-governed

3

litigation, the important thing to realize about a

standard of evidence like preponderance is that it tells

us absolutely nothing about what to do when the evidence

The burden -- the party upon whom

the burden of persuasion is placed fails, that's exactly

right, but that's why you need a burden of persuasion rule

which is different from the standard of proof.

Now, the

I mean, it doesn't seem to me it comes out

MR. DuMONT:

Well, I think if you look at the

19

first and third sentences of section 7(c), you can see

20

that there is a distinction between talking about burdens

21

of going forward and burdens of persuasion, which is

22

really covered by the first sentence, and talking about

the standard of evidence that whoever bears the burden of

persuasion on a particular point has to meet.

MR. DuMONT:

Right.
And what does that say?
That says that -- it says two

things.

First of all, that in enacting the Black Lung

7

Act, Congress intended that claimants be given the benefit

8

of all reasonable doubt as to the existence of total or

that, of course, is taken straight out of several

believe that when it goes on to say,

I don't think that it --

When you say they've taken it out of

The "true doubt" notion, that is

I think it probably first emerged in a Department of

Labor brief within the last year.

11

It is certainly true that for many years there

12

was a principle, and it's a principle that still exists,

13

that when interpreting these remedial statutes where there

is an ambiguity in the statute that cannot be resolved in

some natural way, that you may resolve it in favor of the

claimant.

Well, that's -- in other words, on an

issue of statutory interpretation?
MR. SOLOMONS:

Yes.

And I believe that in the

early cases that the Department is referring to, you will

21

never see -- certainly never see the words "true doubt."

22

You will never see an analysis from those courts that

looks anything like what you have in the briefs here.

What practical difference is there

between the kind of standard you say the courts did apply

and the "true doubt" rule?

that the courts did apply in those other cases has nothing

to do with tied evidence.

Certainly, in our experience it has

Well, how is it applied and

interpreted?

I mean, if the claimant puts on a minimum

amount of evidence and there is substantial evidence on

the other side, is deference given on appellate review to

13

the initial fact finder's determination that the evidence

is in equipoise, even though the appellate reviewer might

not have thought it could be in equipoise?

MR. SOLOMONS:

MR. SOLOMONS:

Almost always what?
Almost always, deference is given

to the finder of fact by the appellate reviewer.

bring out and say, well, this time some control was

QUESTION:

How, how could a reviewing court

determine that the evidence was, in fact, in equipoise,

when it is not even permitted to determine whether there

11

the agency is applying a preponderance standard, the

1

the Department of Labor's regulations way back in

2

718.300's and 400's, and then there's a published

3

commentary in the Federal Register where the Department of

4

Labor says the burden of proving these things is on the

5

claimant, and where this presumption doesn't apply, the

6

burden of proving is going to be on the claimant, two

7

separate provisions.

8

9

And then they even went so far as to publish
commentary in the Federal Register -- when the statute was

10

amended and all of these burden-shifting presumptions in

11

Black Lung were repealed in 1981, they published new

12

provisions in the Federal Register and there they said

13

that we want facts now to be decided for the claimants in

14

accordance with the weight of the evidence.

15

Now, they've said that that doesn't mean

16

anything, but it seems to me that when you have a complex

17

of regulations over here that seem to very specifically

18

address these kinds of questions in a way that is fully

19

consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act and the

QUESTION:

What about the narrow argument under

the Black Lung Act that -- under 718.403, the issue is an

9

issue of the administer --of the Secretary's

10

interpretation of the Department's own regulations.

11

if they may reasonably interpret the reg as being simply a

12

production reg, rather than a burden of persuasion reg,

13

that there certainly isn't any conflict between that and

14

the "true doubt" rule, and that therefore that ought to

15

dispose of the Black Lung case which is before us here.

16

MR. SOLOMONS:

And

Well, first, I think you have to

17

deal with the Administrative Procedure Act there, and in

18

the cases that deal with efforts by agencies to alter the

19

Administrative Procedure Act, some very recent ones on the

20

D.C. Circuit and some older ones by this Court, the

21

holdings have uniformly been that the agency may not write

invalidity of the regulation as the Secretary construes

2

it, in other words.

3

MR. SOLOMONS:

As it is construed, yes, it does.

4

But it's not necessary to construe it that way because I

5

think the regulation still serves a useful purpose.

6

have been cases where there is - - there are in those

7

regulations -- we've cited one, and it's a good case for

8

this; it's called Max Coal v. Anderson, I believe.

9

There

And there there was a - - the Department of Labor

10

has prescribed standards for total disability, some very

11

complex medical standards, and there was just kind of a

12

gap.

13

this gap in favor of the claimant because that's an

14

appropriate method of construction for these statutes.

15

And I don't dispute that.

16

And the Court said, well, we're going to resolve

QUESTION:

Mr. Solomons, can I go back to the

regulation?

18

either you or Justice Scalia's comment.

19

that all reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of

the claimant; it doesn't have any requirement of proof

Well, the hearing officer has got

a job to do, and his job is to conduct these proceedings

in accordance with the normal rules and the APA rules.

Court that this has been going for 60 some years.

This is

Now, if this reflects 60 years of jurisprudence,

16

then I don't see it.

but I think it's a very hard read, and it becomes a more

difficult read if you look at the rest of the regulations.

And, of course, in Longshore, then, they have to give up

on the case entirely because there's nothing.

Now, maybe it could be read into it,

The rest of the regulations require

22

to read burden of proof to mean burden of persuasion

that the third sentence of 718.3(c)

itself contradicts

that reading of the first sentence,

then the administrative law judge is going to be required

2

to carefully review the record.

I don't think there has ever been a close enough --a real

close case, a tie, where an administrative law judge, or

5

any judge, couldn't find a reason to rule in whatever

6

direction the judge thought was appropriate.

7

Sure, in a close case --

That's why this rule is so problematic for us,

8

because the cases where the rule is ordinarily applied are

9

cases where it isn't that close, and then we have to take

10

it up on appeal.

11

increases the volume of litigation in these cases very

12

substantially, because the defense is so mad at having

13

been treated this way and having had the evidence, that it

14

often has painstakingly developed, thrown out the window

15

or discounted just because they don't like them, they

16

don't like the party.

QUESTION:

May I ask, just to be sure I

understand your position before you sit down, on the

5

section 7(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act, do you

6

disagree with the interpretation of the Administrative

7

Procedure Act in the footnote?
MR. SOLOMONS:

8

9

I think that the footnote is

incomplete, and therefore I disagree with it.
QUESTION:

10

But, now, do you take the position

11

that in any administrative proceeding in which the

12

defendant or respondent has an affirmative defense, that

13

the agency has the burden of persuasion that the

14

affirmative defense is insufficient?

15

MR. SOLOMONS:

No, I don't think that's the way

16

it works.

17

by alleging an affirmative defense that's supported by

18

facts, then the administrative law judge, in the ordinary

19

course of things, is going to have to find those facts or

20

not find them.

21

I think that if somebody puts facts into play

MR. DuMONT:

No, it does not use the same words,

but I really think that's irrelevant.

MR. DuMONT:

2

Well,

it puts a label on it.

And,

frankly,

I think all you could say about this is the

Department of Labor and the Benefits Review Board have

5

narrowed and made this concept much more specific to the

6

rule that's in front of the Court today.

7

hardly to be faulted for having taken something that was

8

more general and more vague and made it more specific and

confined its application.

QUESTION:

2

Didn't an earlier version of section

3

7(c) read "the proponent of a rule or order shall have the

4

burden of proceeding except as statutes otherwise

5

provide," and that was changed in the final version to

6

"burden of proof?"
MR. DuMONT:

7

That was changed, and I think the

8

legislative history makes quite clear that change did not

9

import any substantive change.
QUESTION:

11

Did not eliminate the burden of

proceeding.
MR. DuMONT:

12

It did not eliminate it.

But I

13

think it would be a bit difficult, again, to have a

14

situation where you have burdens of persuasion on two

15

different parties, where that's clearly what Congress

16

contemplated, was that whatever burden they were talking

17

about was going to be on more than one party in the case.

18

Finally, I'd like to point out that there's

19

really nothing -- there's nothing necessary about calling

20

something an affirmative defense.

21

Justice Scalia, saying that something's an affirmative

22

defense states a conclusion, not some sort of natural

23

fact.

put a burden of proof on one issue involved in deciding

4

that on the employer, and the Court upheld that as a

matter of policy, deferring to the Board's judgment and

finding that it was reasonable for the Board to take that

The Labor Board had decided, as a

have to look, in every statutory context, at the

particular context involved.
