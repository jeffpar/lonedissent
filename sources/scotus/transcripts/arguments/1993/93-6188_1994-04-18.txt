ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES ROTHFELD

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROTHFELD:

8

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The principal question in this case is whether a

10
11

State prisoner who wants to bring a section 1983 damages

12

action in Federal court challenging assorted

13

constitutional violations that took place during the

14

course of a criminal investigation must first exhaust

15

State postconviction remedies.

16

QUESTION:

Let me ask you, if I may, Mr.

17

Rothfeld, about the theory under which your case was

18

brought under 1983.

19

things which happened at the respondent's --or the

20

petitioner's trial violated the Constitution?

Did it involve -- did it claim that

MR. ROTHFELD:

21

It is focused on acts that took

22

place during the course of the investigation leading up to

23

the trial, so it does not focus on any particular trial

24

event.

25

for example.

It doesn't focus on the introduction of evidence,

QUESTION:

And is it logical to say that if your

2

client were to win his case, that still would not, under

3

some sort of collateral estoppel doctrine, vitiate the

4

judgment of conviction?

5

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think, Your Honor, it

6

quite clearly would not vitiate the judgment of conviction

7

for a number of reasons.

8

problem in this case, and one of the fundamental questions

9

in this case, involves the court of appeals test, which is

First of all, part of the

10

does a damages claim involve an attack on the validity of

11

the conviction.

12

not meaningful in a case like this.

13

And we think that that question is simply

Petitioner, and prisoners in his situation, are

14

not attacking the validity of their convictions.

15

attacking particular constitutional violations that they

16

assert occurred at the hands of particular individual

17

defendants.

18

a challenge that calls into question the validity of the

19

conviction in any sense, because --

They're

And there is nothing, necessarily, about such

20

QUESTION:

Is this --

21

QUESTION:

What would be an example of one of

22

23

their claims, and the constitutional basis for it?
MR. ROTHFELD:

One claim that's made in this

24

case is that exculpatory evidence or potentially

25

exculpatory evidence was destroyed by law enforcement

It's possible that that occurred -- that

on the trial, doesn't it?

claiming the destruction of evidence if you weren't

9

interested in that evidence being used at the trial.

10

MR. ROTHFELD:

I mean, you wouldn't be

Well, there are a variety of ways

11

in which a damages claim can proceed, apart from the use

12

of the evidence of trial.

13

for nominal damages for the violation of the

14

constitutional right.

15

damages because of reckless disregard of constitutional

16

rights by particular law enforcement officers.

17

could be a whole host of --

19

QUESTION:

Prisoner could simply be asking

He could be asking for punitive

Could it be asking for consequential

damages for false imprisonment?

20

MR. ROTHFELD:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well --

Wrongful imprisonment?
There are, I suppose, two types

23

of other damages that could be involved, Justice Souter.

24

One is the one that you're suggesting.

25

mention it, is the sort of ancillary damages that you and

Well, let's just stick to the first

Could they claim them?
MR. ROTHFELD:

I think they could claim that,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, if they did claim them, then it

10

really would go to the heart of the lawfulness of the

11

imprisonment and conviction.

12

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, there are several

13

observations, I think, to make in response to that.

14

true that that particular aspect of the prisoner's claim,

15

and only that aspect of the prisoner's claim, in a sense

16

turns on sort of a but-for question:

17

have occurred but for the constitutional violation?

18

It is

Would the conviction

But even answering that question in the

19

affirmative and saying that the prisoner would not have

20

been convicted had the constitutional violation not

21

occurred does not, in any sense, sort void the conviction

22

or say that it is voidable now.

23

QUESTION:

No, but in -- if that's the -- if the

24

answer turns out to be that there would have been no

25

conviction and there is being a claim -- and a claim is

1

being made for consequential damages, then the State, in

2

that case, is faced with the possibility of sitting back

3

and doing nothing and letting the damages pile up or

4

letting the person go.

5

MR. ROTHFELD:

6

QUESTION:

Well --

And I suppose if the damages amount

7

to anything in substance, the State is going to say we'd

8

better get this guy out of here before he costs us any

9

more money.
MR. ROTHFELD:

10

Well, that would be a practical

11

decision that the State would have to make, Your Honor,

12

but in terms of whether or not exhaustion is required,

13

which is the question here, I think that the Court has to

14

look at the principles that are served, the policies that

15

are served by the habeas exhaustion requirement.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Rothfeld, what about just looking

17

to normal tort principles.

18

statute.

19

such as causality.

20

standard requirements, if you're bringing a cause of

21

action which depends upon the unlawfulness of a

22

conviction, is that the conviction have been set aside.

23

You cannot bring a tort action for malicious prosecution,

24

for example, unless you've been acquitted.

25

This is an old Federal tort

I assume it incorporates normal tort principles
It seems to me that one of the

1

for those constitutional violations that hinge upon

2

innocence without first getting the conviction set aside

3

or having been declared innocent?

4

violations, for example unreasonable searches and

5

seizures, I suppose you can sue on, no matter what, but

6

your damages from being unlawfully detained, you're

7

entitled to them only if you're unlawfully convicted.

8

why shouldn't we apply normal tort principles saying

9

you're not -- you're considered to be lawfully convicted

10

I mean, other

And

unless and until that's set aside.

11

MR. ROTHFELD:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well --

That's just normal tort law.
I think, Your Honor -- and, first

14

of all, that argument has not been suggested at any point

15

during the course of this litigation, but I think, in any

16

event, that suggestion goes to the merits of the claim.

17

All that we're concerned with here is whether or not a

18

1983 action can be brought, whether this district court

19

has jurisdiction to entertain the action.

20

QUESTION:

It may be - -

Well, it goes -- but it goes also to

21

just standard questions of respect for the validity of

22

outstanding judgments.

23

deemed correct and it has not been set aside.

24

MR. ROTHFELD:

25

QUESTION:

You have a judgment here that is

Well, I think --

And yet you're contending that you

1

can ask for damages for the enforcement of that judgment.

2

And I think the underlying concern is whether this suit

3

should just be dismissed on its merits at the outset.

4

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, let me give you two

5

responses to that, Justice Kennedy.

6

that is a question relating to the merits.

7

that, on remand, that aspect and only that aspect of the

8

petitioner's claim could be dismissed on such a theory

9

which, as I say, has not been propounded at any point

10

First of all, I think
And it may be

during the course of the litigation now.
I don't think the Court needs to concern itself

11
12

with that.

It needs to concern itself only with whether

13

the action can proceed to a disposition on the merits.

14

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose -- excuse me.

15

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

16

QUESTION:

I suppose we do, when one of the

17

issues is whether or not we should stay this suit or allow

18

it to be dismissed.

19

damages are going to be foreclosed by the existence of the

20

criminal judgment, then it seems to me that you have a

21

very, very weak case for saying that the suit and this

22

action should remain in the docket of the district court.

23

If most of these cases, most of your

MR. ROTHFELD:

No, I understand that suggestion,

24

Justice Kennedy, but I think, first of all, there are

25

other claims which are presented in this case, claims

1

for -- as we read the complaint, and it is a pro se

2

complaint which is not written artfully, but as we

3

understand it, it asks for nominal damages and punitive

4

damages, as well as this aspect of compensatory damages.

5

In addition, as a matter of the law of issue

6

preclusion or claim preclusion, which is what I think your

7

question goes to, it is not the case that a petitioner --

8

even a petitioner asking for these kinds of consequential

9

damages is attacking the validity of his conviction or

10

calling the validity of the judgment into question.

11

Petitioner -- it may be that if a claim has been

12

adjudicated in the course of the return of the conviction,

13

that that question has been adjudicated and it may be that

14

there would be issue preclusion in that case.

15

QUESTION:

16

could have been adjudicated?

17

What if it wasn't adjudicated but

MR. ROTHFELD:

If it was not adjudicated, Your

18

Honor, the question would be one of collateral estoppel

19

rather than res judicata or the new more fashionable

20

terminology of issue preclusion rather than claim

21

preclusion, because there are actually different parties

22

involved in the litigation.

23

involved in the criminal conviction.

24

brought against individual named defendants acting in

25

their individual capacities.

The State, of course, was

And, in addition, there are different claims

1

involved.

Obviously, the State's claim involved its

3

criminal prosecution --

4

QUESTION:

Yes, but surely if you claim that

5

there was a destruction of evidence by the State and which

6

violated the Constitution, that could have been raised at

7

trial.
MR. ROTHFELD:

8

9

That could have been raised at

trial, Your Honor, that's true, but if the question is one

10

of issue preclusion, the rule to be followed is -- in a

11

case like this, because it's a State judgment which is at

12

issue, one would look to the preclusion law of the State.

13

And Indiana's preclusion law provides that an issue that

14

could have been raised but was not raised is not precluded

15

in subsequent litigation, and therefore it would be open

16

to review.

17
18

QUESTION:

And why do you say the parties are

different here?

19

MR. ROTHFELD:

The State of Indiana was, of

20

course, the party adverse to petitioner in the criminal

21

case.

22

couldn't sue the State of Indiana, which is not a person

23

under section 1983.

acting in their individual capacities.

25

Petitioner has not sued the State of Indiana, and

wouldn't -- that that wouldn't be treated as the same

2

parties, for issue preclusion?
MR. ROTHFELD:

3

I think this is an issue which is

debated in the briefs, Your Honor.

5

reasonably clear that they would not be treated as the

same parties for purposes of issue preclusion.

MR. ROTHFELD:

to that question, Justice O'Connor.

Ginsburg.
Oh, excuse me, Justice Ginsburg.

16

I'm sort used to looking at the other end of the Court,

17

Justice O'Connor.

18

I think that as a black letter rule, individual

19

parties sued in their individual capacities and parties

20

sued in their official capacities are treated as distinct.

21

As to the question you raise specifically, the Court has

22

set out -- has considered this question in the case of

23

Montana v. United States and has listed a number of

24

factors that could come into play in determining whether

25

or not a party that in some sense sponsors the litigation

terminology, in privity with the party who is actually

facing judgment in the case.

QUESTION:

MR. ROTHFELD:

In control of the litigation.
In control of the litigation is

6

one of the factors that the Court has indicated is

7

relevant.

8

to find collateral estoppel in such a case, or to cite the

Court to Sherlock Holmes and the dog that didn't bark,

I think as to whether or not a court is likely

10

there has never been such a case that either the State of

11

Indiana or that we have found, in which an individual who

12

is sued in his individual capacity and receives an adverse

13

judgment, that judgment is then used to bind the State.

think that - -

12

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think, Your Honor, that

13

is, again, a question that would go to the merits that

14

would govern this type of litigation.

15

QUESTION:

Well, I don't think, Mr. Rothfeld,

16

you can separate - - you can have this very narrow

17

jurisdictional analysis that you're trying to limit it to,

18

as opposed to the merits.

19

concerned with how this affects traditional notions of res

judicata and tort actions and that sort of thing.

21

MR. ROTHFELD:

I mean, we've got to be

Well, I think there are several

22

points, Justice -- Chief Justice Rehnquist.

Well, the

23

Court certainly can take into account traditional notions

24

of res judicata.

25

essentially, an identical question in Preiser v. Rodriguez

The Court has already addressed,

and Wolff v. McDonnell, in which prisoners were bringing

2

actions attempting to shorten their sentences.

3

Court held quite clearly in Wolff v. McDonnell and

4

indicated quite expressly in Preiser v. Rodriguez that if

5

a prisoner is suing for money damages, he can proceed

6

immediately in Federal courts while --

8

QUESTION:

And the

Neither of those cases involved

attacks or what could be attacks on judgments of
conviction.

10

MR. ROTHFELD:

That's true, Your Honor, but for

11

purposes of the habeas policies, the Court held quite

12

expressly in Preiser --

13

QUESTION:

It didn't -- it couldn't have held

14

with respect to judgments of convictions since those were

15

not involved in either of them.

16

MR. ROTHFELD:

No, that is true, Your Honor, but

17

the Court did hold in Preiser that -- in response to the

18

argument that actually had been made by the prisoners in

1

that case, that habeas policies were concerned only with

20

judgments of conviction rather than with the length of a

21

sentence, that both concerns were equally close to what

22

the Court called the core of habeas corpus and that that

23

was the basis for the Court's conclusion that exhaustion

24

was necessary, in Preiser.

25

Applying that same conclusion here and

1

determining whether or not exhaustion is necessary here,

2

the Court's conclusion there that a damages action could

3

proceed simultaneously with a State action asking for

4

earlier release, I think is dispositive here.

5

QUESTION:

Well, hasn't every court of appeals

6

that's considered this decided that the State prisoner

7

cannot bring a section 1983 damages action to challenge

8

the constitutionality of the conviction, in effect?

MR. ROTHFELD:
Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

I don't think that's quite true,

There -They seem to be pretty uniform, and I

12

thought in Tower against Glover, which I don't believe you

13

cited, we reserved the question.

14

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, the Court reserved the

15

question in Tower, Your Honor, and said it had -- didn't

16

have to express an opinion on the subject, which was quite

17

clearly true in Tower.

18

Wolff v. McDonnell, which is a case which we think is

19

actually dispositive here, and I think clearly cannot be

20

read as a sub silentio overruling of Wolff v. McDonnell.

21

The Court in Tower did not cite

As to the question of what the courts of appeals

22

have done, I think at least one court of appeals we cite

23

in our brief and in the petition -- it's a case called

24

Mack v. Varelas, a relatively recent Second Circuit

25

decision which has, we think, indicated that petitioners

need not exhaust their damages action in a case such as

this.

There actually was a Second Circuit case called

4

Ray v. Fritz which the Court cited to in Preiser as a

5

illustration of the type of damages action that it thought

6

could proceed, which also involved a claim by prisoners

7

who were seeking earlier release and I think indicates

8

clearly what the Court had in mind in saying that when a
prisoner means to pursue a damages action, that does not

10

call into question - - that is not going to lead to his

11

release.

He cannot do that.

QUESTION:

Mr. Rothfeld, may I leave theory for

14

a moment and ask you a question about practical effect.

15

Is it fair to say that at least in most States, the effect

16

of the exhaustion rule, which is -- which you are

17

protesting, would really simply require you to complete

18

the direct appeal?

1

Because I'm assuming that most States would

20

require a Fourth Amendment issue to be raised at trial or

21

before trial, and if it were not, would not allow it --

22

would find it barred or waived on State habeas, so that as

23

a practical --if that is true as a practical matter,

24

would the rule that you object to in effect require you to

25

do anything more, in practice, than simply complete the

direct appeal?
MR. ROTHFELD:

2

As you indicate, Justice Souter,

3

it would turn on the content of the State postconviction

4

rules.

5

QUESTION:

Yeah.

6

MR. ROTHFELD:

Clearly, in this case the Seventh

7

Circuit thought that there was a postconviction proceeding

8

that could provide relief of some sort to the petitioner

9

in this case.

In many cases it will certainly be true

10

that a prisoner is not going to have any additional avenue

11

available beyond that that's presented on direct appeal.
QUESTION:

12

13

most cases?

14

It'll be -- won't that be true in

I mean, isn't that generally the State rule?

MR. ROTHFELD:

That probably is the general

15

rule.

16

call cases involving fundamental unfairness, and I think

17

that what this suggests is that our rule is - - as a matter

18

of judicial administration, is a much simpler matter,

19

because the State -- the Federal court presented with a

20

damages action is not going to have to determine whether

21

or not there is a State proceeding available.

22

simply adjudicate the 1983 claim on the merits.

23

Now, most State rules have exceptions for what they

QUESTION:

What was the -- what was the

proceeding in this case that was thought to be available

MR. ROTHFELD:

1

Well, the Seventh Circuit didn't

2

identify what it had in mind.

3

mind Indiana's postconviction remedy statute, which, as

4

Justice Souter suggests is true in most cases, would have,

5

as a general matter, require a prisoner to raise -- would

6

bar a prisoner from raising in postconviction proceedings,

7

a claim that either he had raised in his direct appeal or

8

a claim that he could have raised but did not raise.

9

there is an exception in that Indiana statute for claims

10

going to the fundamental fairness of the proceeding, and

11

it may be that the Seventh Circuit had that in mind.
QUESTION:

12

We presume that it had in

-But

Is there anything that could come up

13

in habeas.

14

that you couldn't convert into a 1983 damage claim that

15

you could bring for specific relief, let me out.

16

not so that every habeas claim could be stated alternately

17

as a 1983 damage claim?

18

MR. ROTHFELD:

I was trying to think if there was anything

Is it

That certainly would be true in

19

most cases, because whenever there has been a

20

constitutional violation, there will be at least nominal

21

damages available as a remedy.

22

always going to have to be a set of proceedings, because

23

the State proceedings do not provide for damages, State

24

postconviction remedies, and Federal -- and the section

25

1983 proceeding, of course, concededly does not provide

But the fact is, there is

for release.

So there was always going to have to be a

set of postconviction -QUESTION:

3

But if you're right, then wouldn't

4

this make a massive change.

5

would rather go into Federal court and in damage format,

6

you could always do that, bypass any State postconviction

7

remedy, and skip Federal habeas as the first step.
MR. ROTHFELD:

8

9

You could always -- if you

It would permit a prisoner to go

immediately into Federal court.

I suggest that's not a

10

change so far as this Court's jurisprudence is concerned

11

because, as I said, in Wolff v.

12

v. Rodriguez, this Court indicated quite clearly that a

13

prisoner damages action can proceed immediately,

14

simultaneously with the prisoner's postconviction relief

15

proceedings in the State court.

16

McDonnell and in Preiser

I mean, the Court, it said -- and this is the

17

Court's language from Preiser, that if a prisoner is

18

seeking damages, he is not asking for immediate or early

19

release, and he is not attacking the length of his

20

sentence or the validity of his sentence.

21

case, damages are not an appropriate or available remedy

22

in habeas.

23

conclusion in Preiser, which was applied in Wolff, that

24

exhaustion is not necessary in damages claims.

25

is a logical --

And in such a

That was the rationale for the Court's

1

Well, Mr. Rothfeld, in Tower, which

2

Justice O'Connor referred to, there is an express

3

statement that we have not decided this point yet, and it

also refers to Preiser.

5

written in ignorance of Preiser, the Tower statement.
MR. ROTHFELD:

6

I mean it's not as if it were

That's true, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

But, again, Tower simply indicated that the Court was not

8

going to express an opinion on that, and Tower did not

9

cite to Wolff, which we think is a clear holding of this

10

Court that damages actions can proceed -- damages actions

11

that involve the validity of procedures used to establish

12

the length of a sentence, those actions can proceed

13

simultaneously with an action in State court.

14

QUESTION:

So that insofar as holdings are

15

concerned, we really haven't decided this question, that

16

is whether a 1983 damages action which would amount to a

17

collateral challenge to judgment of conviction could

18

proceed?
MR. ROTHFELD:

19

Well, I think that in terms --

20

the question should be separated into two parts, Mr. Chief

21

Justice.

actions that can proceed in habeas - - clearly the actions

23

in Preiser and in Wolff could proceed in habeas so far as

the length of the sentence was concerned, could proceed

It is true that the Court has not applied that

QUESTION:

Well, you don't agree, then, with the

7

statement in Tower that we have never decided whether 1 83

could proceed without exhaustion?
MR. ROTHFELD:

I think that -- I will have to

10

say that I think that that does not take into account the

11

decision in Wolff, which was not cited --

12

13
14

QUESTION:

Well, why didn't you cite Tower in

your brief?
MR. ROTHFELD:

I think that all that Tower does,

Your Honor, is indicate that the Court is not going to

16

express an opinion on the subject, which was clearly what

17

the Court meant to do in Tower.

18

presented in Tower, not briefed in Tower.

1

that -- indeed, the respondents don't rely on Tower.

20

cite to Tower for some collateral question or issue, but

21

don't say that Tower is dispositive of the question here

22

or that Tower indicates a clear opinion of the Court on

23

the question here.

I think it does not.

obviously the Court will have to determine what it meant

in Wolff.

Wolff opinion that the Court concluded that exhaustion is

4

not necessary in these circumstances, whether or not a

5

petitioner can prevail on the merits of his challenge

suggested, I don't really think the challenge here does

implicate the conviction.

But we think it is clear from the face of the

QUESTION:

And, as I've

Mr. Roth, under your theory, if you

10

can proceed first in section 1983 suit for damages, I

11

assume the petitioner would not then have any issue

12

preclusion against him if he subsequently sought habeas?

13

MR. ROTHFELD:

That is correct.

If he -- well,

if he prevails, obviously, in his 1983 action.

MR. ROTHFELD:

QUESTION:

Well, even if he lost that 1983 -If he loses --

He can go right into Federal habeas

and make claims all over again, based on the same facts, I

19

assume.
MR. ROTHFELD:

20

Well, he would have to - - before

21

he could go into Federal habeas, he would have to exhaust

his State remedies, if any are available, and at that

point he would go into Federal court and litigate the

that there isn't any issue preclusion there.

MR. ROTHFELD:

You think he's estopped?

In a subsequent habeas.

Uh-hum.

MR. ROTHFELD:

In a subsequent Federal habeas

action he would, yes, but in a subsequent State

post-conviction proceeding -- maybe I -- I misunderstood

13

your question.

He could well be estopped in a subsequent

State proceed.

In fact --

15

QUESTION:

I've lost the exchange here.

You

16

were talking about his being estopped after he exhausts

and then he comes back with a 1983 action.

MR. ROTHFELD:

If he exhausts the State

Yes, and loses.

MR. ROTHFELD:

estopped -- and he litigates the question, he would be

estopped in a subsequent 1983 action.

24

that is the very reason that the Court indicated that a

25

1983 action should proceed immediately.

In fact, in Preiser

The prisoners in

1

Preiser had argued that if they were obligated to exhaust

2

their claims first in State proceedings, that if they lost

3

they would be estopped in a subsequent 1983 action.

4

the Court's response was that may well be true, but your

5

solution is to bring your 1983 action now.
QUESTION:

6

And

Why shouldn't it work the other way,

7

that if you litigate and lose in 1983 on the same issue,

8

you should lose it -- I mean why isn't that Federal

9

adjudication just as good as the State adjudication would

10

have been, if you -MR. ROTHFELD:

11
12

13

It is, Your Honor.

And if you --

So then you're changing the answer

14

you just gave to Justice O'Connor saying you would be

subject to issue preclusion.

16

MR. ROTHFELD:

You would be subject to issue --

17

my answer to Justice O'Connor -- maybe I've confused the

point, but my answer to Justice O'Connor is that in the

19

State proceeding you are subject to issue preclusion.

you lose -- if you bring your 1983 action first and lose,

21

the prisoner is then subject to preclusion in the State

that your one -- one habeas petitioner dismissal doesn't

nonpreclusive effect of a State court judgment.

Petitioner's

1

rule in this case is a very simple one, it's very easy to

apply, very easy to understand, but it creates a new order

and one that is very different than the order that

Congress considered was appropriate in enacting the

that this Court has generally deemed appropriate in its

comity jurisprudence such as Younger, which --

QUESTION:

Well, that may be true as a general

rule, but why should it be true in a Fourth Amendment case

10

when there is a practical matter?

11

any Federal habeas so that there's no - - there's no

12

Federal policy of exhaustion that needs to be served.

13

don't we have a separate rule for Fourth Amendment issues?

14

MR. GUTWEIN:

Under Stone there isn't

Why

We believe that Fourth Amendment

15

issues, assuming that they actually attack the legality of

16

the conviction, should require exhaustion.

17

because the rule of comity is that State courts should

18

have the initial opportunity to decide the issues, both

19

factual and legal, of whether a State prisoner's

20

conviction is lawful.

21

QUESTION:

And that is

So in Fourth Amendment cases you're

22

resting it not on the habeas exhaustion requirement, but

23

on an independent rule of comity.

24
25

MR. GUTWEIN:

Exactly.

In the Fourth Amendment

context, this Court has held, under Stone v. Powell, that
27

1

the comity interests there are supreme.

2

so long as there's been a full and fair opportunity to

3

review the matter, will defer completely to the State

4

court's judgment.

5

suggest that in the habeas context where the comity is at

6

its greatest, that that should be a justification in the

7

1983 context to short circuit, at that point, the State's

8

opportunity to initially decide that question.

9

QUESTION:

That this Court,

And I believe it is backwards to

But the rule of comity, in effect,

10

would enact an exhaustion requirement for 1983 which is

11

not required by habeas policy?
MR. GUTWEIN:

12

That is correct.

But let me mind

13

you that some States may not follow Stone v. Powell.

14

Indeed, Indiana does not follow Stone v. Powell.

15

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not concerned about what

16

the States may do, but, I mean, it seems to me that your

17

strongest argument is, as a general rule leaving aside the

18

particular claim involved, that if you don't, in effect,

19

have the rule that you want, you in effect are allowing an

20

end run to be made in the habeas exhaustion rules.

21

you concede that that argument doesn't apply when the

22

claim is a Fourth Amendment claim because under Stone v.

23

Powell there isn't going to be a Federal relitigation

24

anyway.

25

MR. GUTWEIN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And

1

QUESTION:

Okay.

And as a practical matter,

2

then, it seems to me that your argument for comity is

3

really an argument for an exhaustion requirement under

4

1983 which is independent of Federal habeas policy.

5

MR. GUTWEIN:

That is correct.

But we win under

6

your first theory, and we'd be perfectly happy with that,

7

but we have a second theory that is, as you suggest --

8

QUESTION:

9

(Laughter.)

10

What was my first theory?

MR. GUTWEIN:

That if a State prisoner can do an

11

end run around section 2254, that that ought not be

12

allowed, and therefore to the extent that 2254 --

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Yeah, but that doesn't apply here

because of Stone.
MR. GUTWEIN:

We believe it does apply here,

16

because -- and this is a matter in the record.

17

petitioner is not making a Fourth Amendment claim, and we

18

believe that that's quite clear in the record.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. GUTWEIN:

This

I thought he was.
He is not, and let me refer to you

21

to his complaint.

And I'm now looking at page 4 of the

22

Joint Appendix, at the very bottom of page 4 it says

23

between May and July of 1987, and that is the conduct

24

about which he complains after that, conduct that occurred

25

between May and July of 1987.

Now, he refers to a search on page 5 of the

2

Joint Appendix that occurred in 1986, and that's the only

3

search he refers to.

4

1986 search, and there -- indeed, there is good reason for

5

him not to complain about that, and that is because he

6

filed -- the search in this case, as we indicated in our

7

statement of facts, occurred in October of 1986.

8

this action in December of 1988, and therefore that search

9

would have been barred by the statute of limitations, and

10

therefore there was an awfully good reason for him to not

11

complain about that search.

QUESTION:

He is not complaining about that

Well, that doesn't mean he wouldn't

complain about it.

He filed

Maybe he didn't know it was barred by

That's possible too, but we

believe the plain language of this complaint, where he

says between July -- May and July of 1987, and then he

goes on to complain about conduct.

19

complaining about a search here.

20

out that in the Seventh Circuit he also did not complain

21

about a search there also.

So he's not

does that cut with respect to the question of whether one

2

should stay the proceeding or dismiss it?

3

MR. GUTWEIN:

Justice Stevens, in this case

4

Indiana's tolling rule is really quite clear, that where

5

the initiation of an action cannot proceed until another

6

action is completed, that first action is tolled.

7

QUESTION:

Well, then -- then you've given us an

8

incorrect answer with respect to these allegations because

9

these are not barred by the limitations.
MR. GUTWEIN:

10
11

correct.

No, I don't believe that's

His --

12

QUESTION:

You can't have it both ways.

13

MR. GUTWEIN:

No, we -- his section 1983 action

would not be tolled.

by the statute of limitations.

MR. GUTWEIN:

Because it would be tolled.
This action would be tolled --

Because -This action, the 1983 action would

20

be tolled.

But once, now, this action can be brought,

21

then there would be a question of whether the allegations

22

contained within that action were actually timely.

23

think that those are two quite separate issues of

24

whether -- when he initially brought the 1983 action,

25

whether it would be tolled.

And it would not, the

properly pled allegations.
QUESTION:

So he has -- I'm a little puzzled.

It would be barred because at the time he filed the

complaint 2 years had run between the time of the search

and the time of the filing of the complaint.

No.

Because if later he had filed

effects that allowing this kind of short circuiting around

MR. GUTWEIN:

I believe the harm is this, and

that is that if the 1983 court would decide an issue that

consequences of the rule that they propose here.

That result would

Let's take -- and the fact that he has limited

his request to damages and not expressly asked for release

12

does not, in any way, militate the serious comity

13

considerations that are at issue in these kinds of cases.

14

QUESTION:

May I ask a question on that relief.

15

In this case his damages all seem to flow from his

16

confinement, as you read the complaint, but he has this

allegation about destroying his wife's clothing and so

forth.

MR. GUTWEIN:

Sure, yeah.

No.

In that case, if

a determination by the 1983 court would also be a

10

determination that in subsequent proceeding the State

court, or possibly even the Federal habeas court, would

have to make, we believe that comity requires that that

prisoner exhaust.

QUESTION:

Even though he has one count in his

complaint for damages that are totally unrelated to his

conviction.

17

MR. GUTWEIN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

But,

let me emphasize that this is merely a timing question.

19

As I began the argument, this involves the orderly

20

disposition of these claims, and if there is no statute of

claims diligently, then he can later come back and bring

QUESTION:

could use the money.

be very useful to him if he had to wait till his kids

MR. GUTWEIN:

8

9

I mean, there could be cases in

That is true.

But both Congress

and this Court have consistently recognized that when a

10

prisoner is seeking the restoration of their liberty,

11

something that surely has a far greater value than mere

12

damages, that delay is appropriate so that we may allow

13

the State the opportunity, initially, to decide those

14

questions.

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

But as Justice Souter pointed

16

out, you may be talking about -- this is a kind of

17

confused complaint, but you could have a complaint that is

18

totally Fourth Amendment based, so there's no Federal

19

habeas relief later on, and in which one of the claims is

20

for property damage that doesn't affect his conviction,

21

even though it might also establish the conviction is bad.

22

23

should he wait in that case?

case; that the value, the comity values that both Congress

2

and this Court have repeatedly emphasized, that it is

3

critical in our judicial system that State courts have the

4

initial opportunity to decide these issues.

5

under your hypothesis, a necessary element of a later

6

State claim would have been decided by the Federal court,

7

and therefore the State court would have been denied the

8

opportunity to decide that issue.

9

And in that,

Now, I admit that that's a -- that's a difficult

10

question, and luckily -- I'm glad that that question is

11

not at issue in this case.

This is a square attack on the

12

legality of the conviction.

This is a petitioner who says

13

all of my damages flow from the fact that I am wrongfully

14

confined.

15

more difficult cases, as a general matter, in these types

16

of cases when a State prisoner says I should have never

17

been in jail, those types of claims, if decided by a 1983

18

court, will inevitably lead to a State prisoner hopping

across the street, going over to the State courthouse, and

seeking his relief.

that's right.

Because if he establishes that and it's no

harmless error when a confession has been beat out of an

What if he said, nevertheless the

That is correct, Justice Kennedy.

This Court - - this case presents a relatively narrow

QUESTION:

I thought you agreed that that would

be all right, that you would stipulate to a dismissal

court after exhaustion.

correct, we have a right to that dismissal.

The mere fact

that this Court has a quote, virtually unflagging

resolve the stay versus dismissal issue, and that is

really the vast majority of petitioner's argument.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES ROTHFELD

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13
14
15

MR. ROTHFELD:

A couple of points, Mr. Chief

Justice.
First of all, I think that the central question

16

in this case is one that has been identified by Justices

17

Scalia and Stevens in some of their questions.

18

is that petitioner in this case, and petitioners in cases

19

like this, are not necessarily attacking the validity of

20

their conviction.

21

The fact

Respondents have focused entirely on the element

22

of petitioner's claim which asks for damages for the

23

period of his confinement.

24

understand to be nominal damages and for punitive damages

25

which could be awarded notwithstanding any determination

He also asks for what we

1

regarding whether or not that conviction was properly-

2

returned at the time that it was returned.

3

And respondents don't really offer this Court

4

any test at all for resolving these cases.

5

whenever a petitioner -- whenever a prisoner advances a

6

claim that there was a Fourth Amendment violation, or any

7

sort of violation as to which harmless error might apply,

8

there is no way of determining, on the face of that

9

complaint, whether or not that calls into question the

10
11

In fact,

validity of the conviction.
I mean Judge Coffin wrote, I think, a very

12

thoughtful opinion for the First Circuit on precisely this

13

point in a case called Guerro v. Mulhearn, which is

14

discussed in the briefs, in which he noted that it's

15

impossible to determine, without going through the entire

16

line of analysis, if the search was unconstitutional.

QUESTION:

Well, why not apply kind of an

analogy of Rose against Lundy and say that if there's

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think there's no

23

justification for that, Chief Justice Rehnquist-

24

general matter, of course, the Court has held repeatedly

25

that Congress intended that 1983 claims not be exhausted.

Now, there's a specific reason for the exception

recognized for that in Preiser.

that the Court found that it was the intent of Congress

4

that section 2254 (b), the Federal habeas exhaustion

requirement, applied when the petitioner actually filed

what was a habeas petition, an action seeking an

7

injunction that would lead to his release.
The Court said that is a habeas petition and you

The specific exemption is

But the Court went on to

10

say -- and I think it's clear from the face of the habeas

11

statute, that a petitioner who is asking for something

12

other than release is not filing a habeas claim, and as

13

respondents -- I think as my colleague from Indiana

14

conceded, they are not saying that the section 2254(b)

15

exception applies.

16

to create a much more far-reaching comity exception to the

17

general 1983 rule that does not provide for exhaustion.

to hold off doing it now because there are some general

clearly articulated for the Court as to precisely what

24

they are.

Federal court to issue a writ of habeas corpus is an

extraordinarily intrusive thing.

It's also an equitable proceeding so

that we have -- I mean it's a prerogative writ, so we have

MR. ROTHFELD:

That is also true, Justice

Scalia, which is a reason why habeas should be

differentiated from section 1983.

importance of exhaustion; none of them are present here.

And that is particularly important when, as I emphasized,

2

it is the case that for many of these claims it's not

going to be apparent, on the face of the complaint,

4

whether or not the validity of the conviction is in any

manner called into question.

of the 1983 no exhaustion rule repeatedly applied by the

Court, that should be dispositive here.

is just like the old days when you had a claim at law or a

claim for specific relief in equity, you could pick which

one you want?
MR. ROTHFELD:

12

Well, I think that's right,

13

Justice Ginsburg -- and I'll get the name right this time.

plaintiff, as a general matter, is the master of his

not be any such preclusion, I think that that would be

fine with the prisoner.
