CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JORDAN B. CHERRICK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. CHERRICK:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case presents the question of whether the

11

City of Ladue, a small, 8-1/2 square mile residential

12

community, has the right to protect its residents from the

13

proliferation of signs that causes visual blight, harm to

14

the landscape, safety problems, and a deterioration of

15

real estate values.

16

We submit that the sign ordinance at issue here

17

today is constitutional under this Court's time, place, or

18

manner jurisprudence, and we start the analysis with the

19

governmental interests, because under the Court's opinion

20

in Frisby, the Court noted that the governmental interest,

21

the strength of those interests, informs the application

22

of the test and, indeed, those interests are very strong

23

in this case.

24

The City of Ladue has, since its very inception

25

in 1936, made a comprehensive and longstanding commitment

1

to the preservation of its beautiful, aesthetic community.

2

It retained a renowned urban planner, one of the fathers

3

of urban planning in this country, Harland Bartholomew, to

4

devise the city plan which it has consistently followed.

5

The sign ordinance is an essential part of the

6

zoning plan and the comprehensive plan.

7

maintain this unique aesthetic ambience of this community,

8

and it has done so on a consistent basis not only with

9

respect to sign regulation but with respect to

10
11

It is designed to

beautification projects and other issues as well.
QUESTION:

Mr. Cherrick, your ordinance has some

12

exemptions.

13

exemptions, and those exemptions would appear to be

14

content-based as we have used that term in prior cases

15

and, under our existing doctrine, how can you defend those

16

content-based exceptions or exemptions?

17

Not all signs are banned.

MR. CHERRICK:

There's a list of

Justice O'Connor, we think that

18

the exemptions are neutral in the sense that under Ward

19

the controlling test for content neutrality was, what is

20

the Government's controlling purpose, and here, the narrow

21

exceptions that we required are safety-related and those

22

that, in fact, are required by this Court's jurisprudence

23

in the sense that there are no ample alternative modes of

24

expression, such as an onsite sign.

25

QUESTION:

Well, but you have exemptions for

1

sale or for lease signs, which certainly aren't safety-

2

related, and for church signs and so forth, so surely some

3

of those are content-based?

4

MR. CHERRICK:

We think that under this Court's

5

jurisprudence -- for example in the Linmark case the Court

6

held that real estate signs must be allowed because there

7

are no ample alternative modes of expression.

8

Ladue is doing in this context is not targeting the

9

message, it's targeting the medium of signs, and it is

10

also attempting to allow those signs where there is no

11

alternative onsite -QUESTION:

12

So what

Well, do you think we have to apply

13

our usual strict scrutiny test here, and under that test,

14

do you think that the exemptions survive strict scrutiny,

15

that there is a compelling State interest, that there's no

16

other alternative that would be less burdensome, and so

17

forth?

18

MR. CHERRICK:

Justice O'Connor, we think the

19

ordinance does survive the strict scrutiny test, but we do

20

not think the Court needs to reach that test, because what

21

is at issue here today is, in the lower courts what

22

actually happened is that the courts held that if Ladue

23

allows any exceptions whatsoever, the ordinance is

24

content-based, subject to strict scrutiny, and therefore

25

unconstitutional.

We think that that places cities in a classic

1

2

catch-22 position, because on the one hand, under the

3

Court's jurisprudence, for example, in Linmark, certain

4

signs must be allowed when there are no ample

5

alternatives.

A safety --

QUESTION:

6

Is it your position that you cannot

7

draft an adequate time, place, and manner ordinance that

8

would allow some signs of this character?

9

MR. CHERRICK:

Well, Justice Kennedy, under the

10

Ward case the Court has, of course, rejected the least

11

restrictive alternative, and the issue is --

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Cherrick, tell me if I'm wrong,

13

but I thought the Ward case was about the decibel level.

14

It was turning down the volume, not excluding the

15

expression, and here, it seems if you're going to use the

16

Ward case the natural application would be to say you can

17

regulate the size of the sign, you could regulate the

18

number of signs, but how can you use Ward, which is

19

turning down the volume but not excluding expression, as a

20

justification for saying you cannot have any sign of this

21

variety?

22

MR. CHERRICK:

Justice Ginsburg, proliferation

23

is to signs what volume is to loud music, and what Ladue

24

is doing here is focusing and targeting the medium of

25

expression.

The Court pointed out in the Vincent case

1

that signs have a unique problem.

2

creates the problem, and therefore the only way to

3

eliminate this problem of visual blight is to eliminate

4

the medium.

5

here today.

6

It is the medium that

We think the logic of Vincent is compelling

QUESTION:

Is there anything in this record that

7

shows there's a greater danger of proliferation for "Peace

8

in the Gulf" than "House for Sale"?

9

MR. CHERRICK:

The record is undisputed that

10

signs proliferate in neighboring communities, and Ladue

11

does not target any particular message, it is focused on

12

the medium, so that this ordinance applies and prohibits

13

in a particular place signs on the landscape,

14

controversial signs, noncontroversial, political,

15

commercial, noncommercial -- it is focused on this medium.

16

But I would like to address the question that

17

you asked about the alternatives, and we -- even though

18

the least restrictive alternative test has been rejected,

19

we cannot achieve the Government's interest here, Ladue's

20

unique interest, with the alternatives, and let me explain

21

if we look at some of these alternatives.

22

If we limit the size, for example, we still have

23

the proliferation problem.

There is still the

24

multiplicity of these signs under this uncontested record

25

that are displayed and clutter up the windows and the

1

2

yards and the trees throughout the neighborhood.
Now, it has been suggested that we could limit

3

the number of signs.

4

right up against this Court's content-based doctrine which

5

prohibits that, because if we limited the signs to a

6

minimum of one per household, we'd still have over 3,000

7

potential signs.

8

9

Well, if we did that, we would come

But in addition to that, we would have the
problem of Government selecting the speaker and the

10

message, because there could be multiple political races,

11

multiple people living in a home, yet the Government would

12

say that a particular house, there could only be one sign,

13

and in another house a single person would be allowed to

14

speak, and that would offend this Court's jurisprudence,

15

and what we have tried to do is to comply with this

16

Court's First Amendment --

17

QUESTION:

So nothing is better than something.

18

That's essentially your argument, that it's more

19

compatible with the First Amendment to allow nothing than

20

to have a regulation that specifies a uniform size.

21

MR. CHERRICK:

No, Justice Ginsburg, because

22

under this ordinance numerous modes of expression, ample

23

modes of expression are left open for Respondent to speak.

24

For example, a bumper sticker, a button -- those are

25

inexpensive personal expressions which would have achieved

1

a much larger audience than these signs placed on the

2

landscape that could be seen from the street.

3

In fact, the respondent did not even contest the

4

issue in this case in the summary judgment proceedings

5

that there were, in fact, ample alternative methods,

6

which -- we have affidavits that listed over 20.

7

Handbills are allowed.

8

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Cherrick, why would a rule

of one sign per house -- why would that violate this
Court's precedents?
MR. CHERRICK:

We think that would create a

12

content-based problem, because in that instance the

13

Government in effect would be imposing a decision to be

14

made by individuals that in a -- for example, the multiple

15

issues that face -- people want to speak on, they would

16

have to put a sign on one issue, and there may be --

17

QUESTION:

Well, they would presumably choose

18

the right to speak on one issue rather than the right to

19

speak on no issues.

20

MR. CHERRICK:

Well, the problem would be is

21

that you would have -- you would have neighboring people

22

who -- who, for example, would be allowed to speak on a

23

specific issue because they would have the one sign, and

24

there may be just one person living in that house.

25

But I think this goes back to the rationale of

the content-based doctrine that Government should not

2

force people to pick and choose the topics for public

3

debate, and in fact there would be an advantage given to

4

certain households over the others where this is -QUESTION:

You should just prohibit the debate

entirely.

QUESTION:

10

Well, Mr. --

Do you -- excuse me.

No, please

answer his question.
MR. CHERRICK:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

11

the debate is preserved completely, because there are all

12

these uncontested ample alternative modes of expression --

13

handbills and pickets and fliers and bumper stickers and

14

buttons -- and all of this is protected.

15
16

QUESTION:

Don't you have a handbill ordinance?

Do you allow handbills all over the place?

17

MR. CHERRICK:

18

QUESTION:

19

Well, that -- those -- those --

You do?

You allow handbills to be

distributed?

20

MR. CHERRICK:

21

QUESTION:

Well, they do --

It seems to me that would be

22

inconsistent with this very -- very fine neighborhood to

23

have handbills scattered all over the place.

You have to wear colonial costumes

when you hand them out.

(Laughter.)
MR. CHERRICK:

Justice Stevens, as the Court

3

pointed out in Vincent, the problem of handbills can be

4

dealt with in different ways.

5

You have a littering problem.

That is the

6

governmental problem here, but as the Court pointed out in

7

the Vincent case, and as your dissenting opinion in the

8

Metromedia case points out, this is the medium that causes

9

the problem, and therefore the only direct and effective

10

way to eliminate the problem is to eliminate the medium.

11

It's a unique type of situation.

12

QUESTION:

Would you confirm one thing I really

13

want to be sure about?

14

election campaigns, "Vote for Ike" in the window, or "Vote

15

for Adlai," or something like that?

16

permitted in an election campaign?

MR. CHERRICK:

Do you actually prohibit, during

That's not even

No, Justice Stevens, because if

we permitted that we would be favoring that speech over -QUESTION:

And is that ordinance completely

20

enforced and obeyed, that they've never even put election

21

signs up in the windows?

22

there's complete compliance with that?

MR. CHERRICK:

Does the record tell us whether

Well, the record is clear that

24

for 55 years that this ordinance has been consistently

25

enforced and applied in a constitutional -11

QUESTION:

1

Although didn't this come to light

2

because of a complaint that the sign had been vandalized,

3

so it hadn't been -- this wasn't a case of initial

4

enforcement.

5

because the homeowner complained that her sign had been

vandalized?

7

Didn't this come to the town's attention

MR. CHERRICK:

consistently.

nonpolitical signs.

10

QUESTION:

Yes, and the town enforced this

It does not allow any political or

But there's no indication that if she

11

hadn't made the complaint, or the sign hadn't been

12

disturbed, anything would have happened.

13

MR. CHERRICK:

Well, the record is clear that

14

whenever there have been signs and the police have been on

15

notice of it they have applied this across the board to

16

whatever the message -- whatever sign there was that was

17

causing the problem, and I stress here, too, that this

18

Court in the Ward case pointed out that deference must be

19

given to local judgment of city officials to deal with

20

these types of problems, and here we have -QUESTION:

21

22

Was Ward a time, place, and manner

case?

QUESTION:

1

2

Is this a time, place, and manner

case?
MR. CHERRICK:

3

Yes, Justice Kennedy, because it

4

is focused on the medium, the manner of expression --

5

signs -- at a particular place, signs on the landscape

6

that can be seen from the street.
QUESTION:

7

You are also interpreting time,

8

place, and manner as I understand it to authorize you to

9

make a complete prohibition of, I gather, all signs, if

10

you wanted to go that far, is that correct?

11

you to be alluding to Vincent a moment ago as authority

12

for the proposition that you could have gone further than

13

you did, is that correct?

14

you so read Vincent?
MR. CHERRICK:

I understood

Is that your position, and do

If I understand your question,

16

Justice Souter, Vincent and --

17

QUESTION:

Could you have -- in your view, would

18

Vincent have authorized the town to prohibit not only the

19

signs prohibited here, but also the -- at least the

20

private signs allowed here, commercial signs in front of

21

stores, for sale signs, identification signs -- could you

22

have gone the whole hog, as you read Vincent?

Oh, I'm sorry.

No, in this

respect --

QUESTION:

Okay.

MR. CHERRICK:

-- and let me explain.

Signs

6

where there is no ample alternative mode of expression,

7

this Court in Vincent and Ward and the other time, place,

8

and manner cases has held that those signs must be

9

allowed, and that's -- what Ladue is doing here is

10

allowing those signs that for neutral governmental reasons

11

it must allow, such as an onsite sign.

12

those types of signs to get to a particular place.

under the Linmark case, must be allowed.

You must have

A real estate sign,
But the --

Is that also your view on the

16

religious sign that the red brief referred to?

would be allowed to display a sign saying,

reasoning for allowing it what you've just stated?

MR. CHERRICK:

A church would only be allowed to

have a sign identifying the church and what is going on at

would not be allowed, but that is an onsite sign where as

2

a matter of public necessity and convenience people must

3

know what's happening at the church, where it is -QUESTION:

4

And I assume you think, Mr. Cherrick,

5

also, that one of the other reasons why you don't think it

6

would be satisfactory simply to say everybody can have one

sign of any sort is, you think that would be too many

signs.

neighborhood, do you?

You don't want a sign up in every house in this

10

MR. CHERRICK:

11

QUESTION:

Well, that's absolutely correct.

Even one.

Now, theoretically that

12

could happen under your scheme, but it's not likely to

13

happen.

14

neighborhood's not going to be up for sale.

15

It's not likely to happen.

MR. CHERRICK:

Every house in the

Well, those signs are not,

16

naturally, limited in number, and there are many types of

17

signs that can be placed here, and the record is

18

undisputed that this city has followed the counsel of some

19

of the most expert land-use planners to -- who have

20

advised the city that this -- based on this city's unique

21

interest, the comprehensive city plan and the zoning

22

interest, this is necessary.

You consider that a visual blight to

have a sign up in every house -- you walk down the street,

25

every house has a sign, vote for him, vote for the other.

2

You don't want that, right?
MR. CHERRICK:

Well, that's correct, and it's in

3

the reasonable judgment of city officials, as this Court

4

has said, to make the decision about what is beautiful and

5

what is ugly and whether sign proliferation should be

6

allowed, and that is what this city has done, and has done

7

so in a constitutional fashion by only allowing the

8

limited safety and onsite signs.

9

QUESTION:

Why is it that rectangular flags can

10

say anything at all?

Rectangular flags can say "Vote for

11

Ike," isn't that right?

12

MR. CHERRICK:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

That's how you interpret the

14

exception for flags which is contained in the ordinance.

15

You say that means so long as it's a rectangular banner,

16

you can put anything on that banner you want.

17

involved here could have been flown on a flag, right?

MR. CHERRICK:

QUESTION:

MR. CHERRICK:

(Laughter.)

That's correct.

But not a pennant.

Not a pennant?

That was a land-use judgment --

-- a judgment made by --

A pretty stupid judgment.

understand any sense behind that at all.

MR. CHERRICK:

The judgment of the city was --

is that there's certain types of signs that proliferate,

problems than flags.

Flags have never presented the

MR. CHERRICK:

Yes, Justice Souter, and the

based justification?

3

MR. CHERRICK:

No, Justice Souter, because in

4

that situation the city was making a judgment that flags

5

have not created the problem of proliferation and visual

blight, and so therefore it permitted that unique mode.

QUESTION:

Well then, you're going to a

different rationale, then.

9

rationales.

You're saying there are two

One is, some of these exceptions are required

10

by the Court.

The other one is, some of these exceptions

11

do not present risks of blight.

MR. CHERRICK:

QUESTION:

Is that it?

Yes, and --

And they can be identified without

any content base.
MR. CHERRICK:

That's correct, and the Court in

the -- the lower courts have created this very difficult

17

problem that applies not only for a city like Ladue, but

18

would apply, frankly, in other contexts.

19

The Highway Beautification Act follows the very

analogous structure of the Ladue ordinance.

No, and that would be another

It would be very easy for

What about a child's wagon sitting

MR. CHERRICK:

I suppose that

Yes, but it is important to

consider the overall land-use plan, not the individual

If she had a wheelbarrow that she

rolled onto her front lawn and propped up the sign on

16

MR. CHERRICK:

No, but that -- again, we think

it is not appropriate to look at the individual case.
As the Ward court pointed out, one must look at

17

the overall governmental purpose, and here we're dealing

18

with a land-use plan, a comprehensive zoning plan, and you

have to look at all of -- what would happen if Ladue

allowed one sign, it would allow all of these signs, and

it is when those signs that are attached to the land, that

is when the visual blight and the proliferation problem

Ladue has enforced its ordinance in a number of instances

against cars parked in driveways or in front of houses

MR. GREIMAN:

That's part of our position, Your

Honor, but here we're talking about a particular mode of

expression, and we're talking about whether there's some

9

alternative to that mode of expression that is of equal --

QUESTION:

No, but as I understand what you were

just saying, if the city said, we're going to set aside

two acres on one of the downtown streets, and anyone can

put up a sign down there, this particular woman can go

14

down and put up a sign about the Gulf War, you would not

find that an adequate alternative, isn't that correct?

16

MR. GREIMAN:

17

That's correct, Justice Souter.

And the reason you wouldn't is that

18

you believe the speech has got to be allowed from one's

that if the city can prohibit the signs in the manner in

MR. GREIMAN:

I don't believe that the City of

Ladue may ban that mode of expression entirely.
QUESTION:

4

Well, that may be, but if they can

ban what they're purporting to ban here, can they ban that

6

as well?

7

MR. GREIMAN:

If you accept that they can ban

8

what they ban here, I believe the implication of that

9

position is yes, they can ban her from standing on a

10
11

soapbox at her property.
I believe the implication is that they could ban

12

private conversation on the sidewalks on the notion that

13

that interferes with the ability to hear birds chirping.

14

Or I believe that they could ban gatherings on public

15

sidewalks on the notion that clumps of people impair the

visual beauty of the natural landscape.

QUESTION:

Well, except the problem there is

19

you'd suddenly find yourself in the public forum doctrine,

20

and the city's claim here is there's no public forum.

They're simply using private property to create clutter.

So I think your argument's got to be that they couldn't

MR. GREIMAN:

Justice Souter, on the continuum

of nonpublic forum,

Ms. Gilleo's private home here has to ne viewed as either

the equivalent of a public forum for protected purposes,

QUESTION:

But I just want to make one thing

clear.

Do you agree that there is no ordinance which

5

MR. GREIMAN:

6

QUESTION:

I'm not aware of any, Your Honor.

Mr. Greiman, would it be a reasonable

7

alternative if at some public and prominent site within

8

the community -- for instance, city hall -- there were a

9

space or a big bulletin board allowed where the homeowners

10

could place signs of any type, and could identify

11

themselves as being homeowners within the city, so that

12

everyone who saw it would know, this is the expression of

13

the view of the homeowner who put it up?

14

MR. GREIMAN:

I don't believe so, Justice

15

O'Connor, for this reason.

16

rather than at your own home, you lose the special

17

communicative impact that you gain from your own home.
QUESTION:

18

By speaking in that manner

Well, how is that if the sign itself

19

allows you to identify yourself as a homeowner in the

20

community?

21

MR. GREIMAN:

Well, for example, a "Tax the

Rich" sign posted in front of an affluent home carries a

different communicative impact than would the exact same

24

2

Mr. Cherrick, if you reject the

9

of cloth, and hang it outside.

10
11

Now, that's just a manner.

All you have to do is

It's all right.

That's

manner.
MR. GREIMAN:

Well, Justice Scalia, that gets

12

into arbitrariness, and perhaps viewpoint discrimination.

13

American flags are readily and easily available --

14

QUESTION:

Not American flags, any flag.

Any

15

piece of cloth qualifies as a flag under this ordinance.

16

You can have a cloth that says, "Oppose the Gulf War," and

17

hang that outside, and that's okay.

18

MR. GREIMAN:

That suggests that if one wants to

19

display an American flag at one's home, one can very

20

easily go down to the corner store, buy one, and put it

21

up, but if you want to display a custom-made flag message

you have to go to a great deal of trouble, perhaps, or a

great deal of expense to have your own sign custom-made.

the arbitrariness and the content-discriminatory nature of

has no lesser impact on so-called visual blight than does

Perhaps the major flaw in Ladue's position

throughout this case is that it largely ignores the

interest that somebody might also have.

18

there is that -- and I think this is the central factor

that one needs to look at in analyzing this case, is that

20

with the Highway Beautification Act there is a strong

21

reason for prohibiting that kind of a sign, because if you

22

had every house that an interstate highway went by with a

prohibiting this sign is that the proliferation of an

2

unlimited number of signs in the community is an evil.

3

They do not say, I don't think they mean, and I

4

don't think they could possibly say that single signs, or

5

very small numbers of signs, are a problem.

6

QUESTION:

I'm not sure I follow the argument.

7

I thought that you began with the premise that the Highway

8

Beautification Act is sustainable because there will be --

9

there is a real danger of proliferation, and then you say,

10

and the only thing that Ladue says to justify its

11

ordinance is proliferation.

12

between the two and not a distinction between the two.

13

MR. BENDER:

I see there a parallel

I think you have to look first at

14

the reason why the governmental unit is trying to impose

15

the regulation.

16

In the case of the Highway Beautification Act, I

17

think it's a feeling that insofar as possible, when people

18

drive down highways they should see the scenery and

19

shouldn't see signs.

20

people look out of their window they shouldn't see a sign.

21

What Ladue is worried about is the unlimited proliferation

22

of signs, and I think what they've done wrong here is that

23

to assert the interest in unlimited proliferation they

24

have just stopped all signs altogether.

fact that doesn't work, if in fact there is a problem,

then perhaps sometime they might be able to do this, but

Even if you talk about real

I think you can't just look at

What we're asking is whether or not there's a

MR. BENDER:

Right.
And you say that there's less of an

MR. BENDER:

2

When those interests come into

collision in that way, I think you have to give the

decision to the governmental interest if it's reasonable,

but there is a situation, if the only place the homeowner

can put a sign is facing on the highway, then there the

overwhelms that.

2

Normally, unless the house is right next to the road, and

The Highway

I think the city's the same.

I think

10

signs that can't be seen from the street would not violate

11

the city's ordinance.

12

MR. BENDER:

It's exactly like the Government.
Except that with the Highway

13

Beautification Act, that limitation means that people can

14

preserve the right to communicate with their neighbors who

15

might walk in front of the house, between the highway and

16

the house and see the sign, without injuring the Federal

17

interest of cluttering up the landscape for people driving

18

by.

19

This prevents people from using that traditional

20

means of expression to communicate with their neighbors

21

entirely, and there's no basis that we know of for doing

22

that.

23

There is no indication --

24
25

There's never been a clutter problem in Ladue.

Does the city have to wait until

there is a clutter problem before dealing with it?

think we said in City of Renton that a city doesn't have

to wait until the evils materialize before dealing with
