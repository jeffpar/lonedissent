CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

the Town of CLarkstown, New York.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETTY JO CHRISTIAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The issue in this case is whether the Commerce

12

Clause prohibits a municipal ordinance that requires all

13

trash, including trash that originated in other towns and

14

other States, to be sent to a designated local facility

15

for processing before it can be shipped to other States

16

for disposal.

17

Petitioners operate a recycling facility in

18

Clarkstown, New York.

19

and from points in New York outside of Clarkstown,

20

separate it into recyclable and nonrecyclable components,

21

process and bale or package both components, and then ship

22

them to users or disposers in other States.

23

They receive trash from New Jersey

The Clarkstown ordinance permits them to ship

24

the recyclables directly to users in other States.

25

However, it prohibits petitioners from shipping the

1

nonrecyclable trash directly to waste energy plants or

2

landfills in other States, and requires instead that they

3

be sent to a designated transfer station in Clarkstown,

4

which levies --

5

QUESTION:

Ms. Christian, what sections of the

6

ordinance are you attacking?
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

7

We are primarily attacking

8

section 5.

The respondents have taken the position that

9

this case is governed instead by section 3.

To the extent

10

that section 3 has any bearing on trash that originated

11

outside of Clarkstown, we are attacking that section as

12

well.

13

originated in towns outside of Clarkstown.

But our challenge is limited to the trash that

14

QUESTION:

15

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

16

QUESTION:

Thank you.
The designated --

Excuse me.

Why don't you have any

17

objection to trash that's generated within Clark -- you

18

don't have any objection to trash generated within

19

Clarkstown?

20

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

I think, from the standpoint of

21

constitutional analysis, Justice Scalia, it is also

22

invalid under this Court's prior decisions.

business matter in the lower courts --

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

You don't care.

(Laughter.)

2

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

The petitioners chose to

3

challenge only the out-of-town trash, because that's what

4

their business really consists of.
QUESTION:

5

Well, now, Ms. Christian, you started

6

to tell us how the ordinance applies.

7

prohibit you from shipping the waste on out --

8

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

9

QUESTION:

10

Now, does the city

Yes --

-- Or is it a matter of requiring

you to pay the charge before you ship it out?
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

11

The city prohibits petitioners

12

from shipping the trash directly to out-of-State users or

13

landfills.

14

QUESTION:

But after it's sorted and in the

15

city's facility, or processed in the city's facility, and

16

if you pay the charge to the city, then can you ship what

17

remains out?

18

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

As -- as we understand the

19

ordinance as it has been interpreted by the city, the

20

petitioners are required, after they have processed and

21

baled the trash, to deliver it to the designated transfer

22

facility.

23

a ton, and then the transfer facility itself ships the

24

trash to landfills in other States.

25

That transfer facility levies the charge of $81

instead of taking the trash directly to an out-of-State

2

destination, petitioners are required to take it to the

designated facility.

5

The designated facility then

And the petitioners are in the

6

business of disposing of waste and they can do it more

7

cheaply if they don't have to submit it to the town

8

processing.

Is that --

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

It is less expensive for the

10

out-of-State customers of petitioners, and with respect to

11

petitioners the Clarkstown ordinance, in effect, adds an

12

expense of $81 for every ton of nonrecyclable trash.
QUESTION:

13

Now, does the town impose that if you

14

pick up waste from another -- from outside the town and

15

simply transport it through the town without any further

16

treatment?

17

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

18

QUESTION:

1

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

Well, petitioners --

Does it apply to that?
It apparently does not apply to

20

that, but, in fact, petitioners do not do that.

21

Petitioners are in the business of operating a recycling

22

facility.

QUESTION:

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

In the town.
In the town.

picking up trash in the other towns or States.

3

brought to them by private trucking companies, which bring

the trash to petitioners.

bale the trash, and then load it onto the trucks of

6

independent trucking companies.

QUESTION:

Petitioners themselves are not
It is

Petitioners then process and

Okay, all right.

Well, now the town

8

treats everyone alike, whether you're inside or outside

9

the town, I take it?

10

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

But the -- that is correct, but

11

the constitutional flaw is the export ban itself, the

12

local processing requirement.

13

that there was no discrimination against interstate

14

commerce because it applied the local processing

15

requirement to local as well as out-of-town trash.

16

QUESTION:

The lower courts reasoned

Well, are there some municipal

17

functions that the municipality can undertake as a

18

monopoly and impose its will on everyone, like sewage

19

disposal or something of that kind?

20

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

Certainly, Justice O'Connor,

Can a municipality have a monopoly?
Well, a municipality certainly,

23

if it wished to take on the job of trash collection

24

itself, could take the trash wherever it wants to take it.

25

And the municipality certainly can impose reasonable

health and safety and environmental requirements with

2

respect to the handling of trash.

3

substantial power under the zoning laws to determine

4

whether and to what extent trash facilities will be

5

permitted in the town.

They also have

Now, in this particular case the town had

6

7

initially denied petitioners' request for a permit to

8

operate the recycling facility.

9

the New York State courts.

That was appealed within

The courts ruled that the town

10

had acted improperly in denying the permit, and directed

11

the town to issue the permit, and the permit has now been

12

issued.

13

QUESTION:

In your view, if the city engaged in

14

the hypothetical function that you were just discussing

15

with Justice O'Connor, so that it owned the trash facility

16

and collected it, could it enforce its monopoly by a

17

criminal sanction?

18

approaching the Springfield ordinance.

19

I mean like something like --

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

I think we have to draw a

20

distinction between a city that merely operates the

21

transfer station itself as a municipal facility, and a

22

city that also collects the trash.

23

QUESTION:

24

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

25

Assume the latter.
If the city itself collects the

trash, then it can take the trash wherever it wants.

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

We

1

don't think that the city could prohibit petitioner, who

2

holds a license to operate a recycling facility, from

3

transporting trash outside the State.

4

QUESTION:

Well, what if New York law changed

5

the provision that allowed the petitioner to have a

6

license, and New York law said that individual

7

municipalities can operate monopoly trash disposal, or

8

organizations?

9

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

I think the issue there, Mr.

10

Chief Justice, would be whether or not that is an

11

appropriate subject for public utility regulation as a

12

monopoly, and that would bring into play a totally

13

different set of requirements.

14

15
16

QUESTION:

But that --

Well, that's not a constitutional

question, is it?
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

That would primarily be a

17

question of State law.

18

might involve some constitutional issues with respect to

19

its effect on a facility such as petitioners', that

20

previously held a license, but those would be entirely

21

different issues and that's not this case.

22

QUESTION:

It conceivably, I would think,

Suppose in this case the city had

23

advertised widely for bids for a transfer facility and

24

awarded the transfer facility to an out-of-State company

25

at an out-of-State site?

So you have roughly this case,

1

except the transfer facility is out of State, would you

2

then have a constitutional argument?
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

3

I think that you would for this

4

reason, because it would still prohibit the export of

5

trash out of the State to any other point in interstate

6

commerce, to any point other than the designated transfer

7

facility.
QUESTION:

8

9

Would you call that protectionism or

simply the State exceeding its appropriate jurisdiction?
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

10

I think I would call that

11

protectionism, because it -- at least if, as in this case,

12

the result is to confer a direct benefit on the town and

13

its residents.

14

benefit to the town.

15

facility was constructed, the town entered into a

16

take-or-pay agreement under which it guarantees the

17

transfer facility a certain volume of trash.

18

guarantee is not met, then it has to pay for the lost

19

revenues.

20

In this case there is clearly a direct
At the time that the designated

And if that

So that every ton of out-of-town trash that

21

petitioners can be forced to send to the designated

22

facility, instead of directly out of State, results in a

23

reduction of the town's liability under the guarantee of

24

$81 a ton, and a direct benefit to the town's residents, a

25

direct burden on interstate commerce.

And I would think

it would make no difference if the facility happened to be

2

located across the line in another State, as long as

3

that --

4

QUESTION:

Ms. Christian, I don't gather that

5

the Commerce Clause permits a State to favor commerce with

6

one State over commerce with other States.

7
8

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

That would be our point

exactly.
QUESTION:

9

It's just a matter of favoring your

10

own.

You also can't say New York favors New Jersey, and

11

we don't favor shipping to other States, you can't do

12

that.

13

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

I believe that this Court has

14

struck down reciprocity requirements in the past that were

15

limited in such a way that they are, in effect,

16

prohibiting the export to any States other than the

17

favored State.

18

QUESTION:

Ms. Christian, did I understand your

19

answer to Justice O'Connor was essentially that the town

20

isn't doing enough to escape from this Commerce Clause

21

check?

22

you would have no complaint, but it's only because they

23

don't haul the trash themselves that you can make this

24

argument.

25

That is if they handled the entire trash business

Is that -- do I have it right?
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

I don't think that's quite

it.

Let me see if I can clarify

Under the market participant doctrine, the town

3
4

would be entitled to enter into the trash collection

5

business as a participant in the market.

that, it would be permitted, like any private business, to

that it collected to a private facility.
Now if, in addition to collecting trash itself,

10
11

it also permitted the operation of petitioners' recycling

12

facility, which is licensed by both the town and the State

13

to conduct a recycling operation, then we do not believe

14

that the town could compel petitioners to make use of the

15

designated transfer facility.

16

if the town wished to take on the function of collecting

17

trash itself, then under the market participant doctrine

18

it could take the trash that it collected wherever it

1

wants to take it.

20

deal with.

I was only suggesting that

It can deal with whoever it wants to

We believe that this case is essentially

21
22

governed by the prior decisions of this Court in City of

23

Philadelphia v. New Jersey and in Fort Gratiot Landfill v.

24

Michigan.

25

barring the import of trash into a State.

Those cases, of course, struck down laws

There are basically only two fundamental

1

differences between those cases and this case.

3

of course, is that this involves a restriction on the

4

export of trash; those cases involved restrictions on

import.

QUESTION:

And second --

Because there was a discrimination in

those cases too, wasn't there?
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

There was a different treatment

12

in those cases of local and out-of-town trash.

13

this case, and in the -- as -- this case is like the local

14

processing cases or the export ban decisions previously

15

decided by this Court, in which you have a -- an overt

restriction on the flow of interstate commerce itself.

making a burden argument, period.

Certainly it is a burden

14

Do you think it's discrimination against interstate

commerce?

16

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

I think it's probably a

17

discrimination against petitioners' out-of-State customers

18

who are required to undergo additional processing after

19

their trash has already been processed and baled, at the

20

designated facility.

21

attack has been on the burden that this statute creates on

22

the free flow of interstate commerce.

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

1

I think it is a discrimination

2

against exporters.

3

you could say it is not a discrimination is that it

4

discriminates against the export of trash by both local

5

and out-of-town trash.

discriminates against the exporters of trash and also is a

burden on interstate commerce.

believe it's invalid.

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

Under either test, we

We think it falls within the

11

category of laws that overtly block the flow of interstate

commerce and therefore are virtually per se invalid.

You said a second ago as a factual

matter something that I just didn't understand.

that the -- the -- well, I may have you wrong.

to landfills or to waste energy plants.

2

is needed, and yet under this statute it is required to go

3

to the designated transfer facility for additional

4

processing at the transfer facility.
QUESTION:

5

Okay.

Nothing further

But the fact that your clients

6

do bale their residue is not a requirement of the town

7

ordinance.

8

separate the recyclables that they take out from what is

9

then going to be ultimately baled and exported, they could

In other words, as I understand it, after they

10

just bring that in bulk to the town transfer station, and

11

it would be processed and baled there, wouldn't it,

12

couldn't it?
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

13

I think two points.

First of

14

all, as a practical matter you're talking about 150 tons

15

of trash a week.

16

when it comes off the conveyor belts after the recyclables

17

have been separated out, it goes into the processing

18

machines where the processing and the baling occurs.

19

as a practical matter --

The way that the processing is handled,

QUESTION:

20

So

But isn't that simply a function of

21

the way your clients have set up their plant?

22

they set it up in such a way that they take out the

23

recyclables and what is left gets dumped into a truck and

24

the truck goes to the town transfer station where it's

25

baled?

Couldn't -- couldn't that happen?

Couldn't

1

I'm not sure that that would be

2

consistent with the permit under which they operate by New

3

York State, or by the town itself.

4

example, the handling of trash is strictly regulated.

5

requirement, for example, is that all nonrecyclable trash

6

that goes through petitioners' facility must be moved out

within 24 hours.

Uh-huh.

In any case, I take it your

case does not depend on -- really on the answer to my

question.

One

So you can't have trash piling up

QUESTION:

9

Under the permit, for

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

No, it does not, because even

13

if under -- under this Court's local processing decisions,

14

even if there were no local -- duplicate processing

15

involved, it would still be an overt restriction on the

16

flow of interstate commerce.

May I ask, to be sure I'm clear on-

one question -- do I correctly understand, you do not

challenge the scheme insofar as it gives the town a total

monopoly of the processing and distribution of trash

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

In the lower courts,

petitioners limited their Commerce Clause challenge to

trash that originated outside the town, that is correct.

Because then the ordinance wouldn't hurt you at all, if

you were outside the city limits, would it?
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

3

If we were not in Clarkstown,

then the ordinance would not apply, because it only

applies within the confines of Clarkstown.
QUESTION:

It still would have an impact on you

because you couldn't get any locally generated trash, but

you don't object to that.

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

We did not raise a Commerce

Clause challenge.

Quite candidly, we believe that as a

matter of constitutional analysis, the ordinance also

violates the Commerce Clause with respect to locally

generated trash.

That is not at issue in this

The only thing that's as issue is

whether you can be compelled to move outside the city

you're going to stay in business, you just have to move

that that factor can't adequate serve --be served by

justifications that the town has sought to offer.

We believe that the out-of-town

As far as health and safety or environmental

5

justifications are concerned, petitioners are subject to

7

exactly the same requirements as the designated facility,

8

and the town can certainly add more stringent requirements

if it thinks that's necessary.

10

There is no danger that this facility will be

shut down in the absence of the flow control ordinance.

12

The only danger is that the town might have to make good

under its guarantee, and that is, by definition, economic

it's the House committee report on that statute, they did

We don't think that you need to reach the issue

2

of nondiscriminatory alternatives at all, because there is

3

nothing here other than economic protectionism.

4

simply to complete our point, it is apparent that even if

5

there were some valid nonprotectionist purpose, those

6

purposes could be met adequately by means that do not

7

impose a burden on interstate commerce.

8

But

To begin with, there is the simple expediency of
the transfer station, the designated facility, competing

10

in the marketplace for trash.

11

think it's important to observe that, in the absence of

flow control laws, there's no apparent reason why the

designated facility would not be able to compete

14

successfully for trash in neighboring towns and States.

And in this connection, I

protectionism means the allocation of economic benefits

among private parties engaged in commerce on the basis of

political geography.

protectionism is discrimination.

It means that those who

I would like to -- I make that statement because

First of all, since there is no discrimination, we are

outside of the universe of economic protectionism.

It has to do with the discrimination between the

I mean,

1

if I am not getting anything personally out of -- out of

2

discriminating against interstate commerce, it is not

protectionism and therefore it's okay.

MR. BRASHARES:

Well, Your Honor, I think this

5

is what the Maine against Taylor case is probably all

about.

7

presumption that when a State or local law discriminates

8

on the basis of geography, that there is a protectionist

9

purpose.

I think there is certainly a very strong

I think what the Court has said is that that is

10

rebuttable if you can show that there is not -- there is,

11

in fact, a rational basis for the discrimination.

12

think in Maine against Taylor, what the Court, in effect,

13

did was to say, yes, there is a rational basis here.

And I

But I think the absence of benefit does not
necessarily make the discrimination condoned.

Well, but it has to be reasonable.

protectionist, but that it is reasonable, right?

MR. BRASHARES:

protectionism and discrimination on a geographic basis.

2

What I am saying is that it is almost impossible,

3

unthinkable to find a State or local law which allocates

or regulates, on the basis of geography, those who are

5

within the political process being treated one way and

6

those outside another way, without there being some

7

element of protectionism.

8

9

I would grant that there could be cases where
discrimination did not have those benefits, but I

10

think --or allocation.

11

this case, first of all, we do not have a law which has a

suppose every law which regulates locally and has the

effect of preventing a product from going out of the

jurisdiction, in the same sense is an export ban.

But I think here, if I can get to

We do not have a law which classifies on

that is moving in interstate commerce?
Well, to suggest that there is a capturing

and the town is reaching out for its greedy purposes,

capturing the truck and making them pay a fee to pass

through.

That is not at all what's going on.
I need to remind -- I need to state that the

interstate commerce from local commerce.

10

As I said, the

material which is regulated -QUESTION:

11

If you took California Reduction on

QUESTION:

Well, we'll agree with you that you

had to close down the landfill for environmental purposes,

thought you said a moment ago that you could.
MR. BRASHARES:

submit that those are relevant questions to raise in the

we're going back and reevaluating under the -- under the

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not sure we are.

Every

I think the next -- the

QUESTION:

Uh-hum.

2

MR. BRASHARES:

We have the unprotected

interests, and they are not participating in the political

process that produced that regulation, and therefore they

should not be bound by the substantive due process

6

determination that the Court has made in that case.

7

when the same parties who are protected then claim the

8

burden -- which is this case, of course; Carbone is, of

9

course, a local Clarkstown interest who is within the

protected interest -- then there's no basis for the claim

11

that we should now go back and reevaluate the burden on

commerce in comparison to the local benefits.
QUESTION:

13

I don't understand.

You say because

14

Carbone is in Clarksburg itself, this restriction can be

imposed on Carbone.

Does that mean you can --

-- You can prohibit your local

MR. BRASHARES:

No, no, Your Honor, I'm not

It would have to be some kind of a

QUESTION:

What the Clarkstown --

Every local person has to buy at the

that is the label that the petitioners attempted to put on

That's not what this law does.

I don't think -- I think if that judgment is made under

the Fourteenth Amendment that there is a rational basis

for the city to use that method to advance a legitimate

12

interest in the environment, the local environment, then I

13

don't -- I don't believe we go back and reevaluate that

under the Commerce Clause.

responsibility, then we will know that the waste is being

QUESTION:

4

It's very -Well, but our civilization has

advanced to the point where garbage is valuable -

5

MR. BRASHARES:

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. BRASHARES:

Your Honor --

That is a major point that the

8

petitioners make, but it's wrong.

Some garbage is

9

valuable if it's the part of the garbage that can be

10

pulled out and sold for recycling.

11

about it, the waste that is left over after the valuables

12

are removed, as they are allowed to be removed and shipped

13

out anywhere under the Clarkstown ordinance, that garbage

14

is worth less today than it's ever been worth, because the

15

cost of getting rid of it is higher than it's ever been.
QUESTION:

16

But make no mistake

Well, do you rest your argument in

17

part, then, on the notion that what is left, and what is

18

at issue here, has no value and is not an article of

19

commerce?

20

MR. BRASHARES:

Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't

21

rest on that, because I think that the economic

22

protectionism analysis that I've been through I think

23

suffices for an affirmance of this case.

24

that those points need to be considered, about whether it

25

is an article of commerce.

But I do think

1

What I have suggested in the brief is that there

2

are three doctrines which converge on that.

3

of basically is it in commerce when the local jurisdiction

4

essentially has a separate transaction between the place

5

where it's discarded and the place where it is -- comes to

6

the transfer station

7

The doctrine

The second, I think the quarantine cases have

8

application here, because the idea of the quarantine

9

cases -- and it's a nondiscriminatory quarantine -- is

10

basically to say this is something we consider dangerous

11

to the local community.

12

if it's not properly attended to, and therefore we are

13

going to take it out of the process of commerce.

14

Certainly, garbage is dangerous

And the third is from the Sporhase case, the

15

argument that the Court has recognized, as it did in that

16

case, that you will take into consideration what private

17

rights the State has given to engage in a particular

18

business such as the removal of groundwater.

19

For those reasons, I do urge the Court to

20

consider whether one approach to this case is to consider

21

that the effect of the city's monopolizing this business,

22

taking over in effect, requiring the waste to be treated

23

in this way is, in effect, removing it or withholding it,

24

if you would, from commerce.

matter?

I want to be sure I understand you correctly.

2

it correct that there would be no violation of the

3

ordinance if the petitioner separated out the recyclable

4

garbage and shipped that out of State and made money out

5

of that, so long as it took the nonrecyclable and shipped

6

it over to your facility and paid $81 a ton for that

7

portion of it?

8

MR. BRASHARES:

9

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And they say there's some practical

10

reason why they can't do it, some 24-hour limit and so

11

forth.

12

just pay a little more for that portion of the business?

Is it practically feasible for them to do it and

MR. BRASHARES:

13

Your Honor, there's nothing in

14

the record which suggests it's not practically feasible.

15

Indeed --

16

QUESTION:

And as far as you're concerned,

17

representing the town, that would be perfectly lawful if

18

they were willing to do it?

19

MR. BRASHARES:

20

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

And then do you draw the conclusion

21

for that -- for that reason, after the garbage is

22

separated you are entitled to look at the nonrecyclable

23

residue as locally generated because it was generated

24

within the town?

another is Carbone's recycling center, and each one of

17

them is required to recycle and each one of them is

required to put out the residues.

that when that happens, those residues will be handled in

20

a particular way that we had determined to be

environmentally appropriate. And that way is that it will

be brought to a designated transfer station and that it

based upon the fact that it originated out of the town of

requiring the city to do what it has struck down time and

In the absolute sense, virtually all State

Where the burden

on competing in-State interests, however, it is a burden

12

In such cases, nothing in Commerce Clause jurisprudence

entitles out-of-State interests to more strict judicial

review than that to which the in-State interests are

entitled, i.e. arbitrary and capricious review under the

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it

please the Court:
Respondents,

in response to a question,

required that trash must be processed within 5 miles of

There is no difference,

Because that transfer station is

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

It is within Clarkstown.

But may I ask a question?
I believe there was a question

18

to respondents if it would be valid if it -- if the law

19

required processing within 5 miles of Clarkstown.

20

this falls within that description.

21

QUESTION:

I think

But is it correct that there -- that

the processing itself violates the ordinance?

23

it was what you do with the residue after the processing

24

that preempts the -- creates the problem.

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

That's right, and pay them $81

QUESTION:

So you're not objecting to -- you're

not objecting to any restriction on process.
MRS. CHRISTIAN:

No.

We're objecting to the

13

restriction that requires what they require -- regard as

local processing at the designated transfer facility, for

15

which they charge the $81 a ton.

They why isn't the residue locally

place within the community?

12

MRS. CHRISTIAN:

For one specific reason.

We do

not discard the revenue -- the residue.

14

business consists of the handling of trash.

15

separate out the recyclables petitioners themselves

16

process and bale the trash, and themselves ship it to

17

landfills or waste energy plants which they pay to accept

disposal of the nonrecyclables.

19

difference is that petitioners never discard anything.

They're in the business of handling the trash.

We do not discard trash, but the ordinance nevertheless
