ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD W. GILLINGHAM

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER TUILAEPA

14
15

MR. GILLINGHAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

16

We come here today relying upon our record and

17

the clear, firm, unequivocal mandate of this Court.

18

State chooses to use aggravating factors in the penalty

19

determination phase and they play a critical role, they're

20

subject to vagueness analysis under the Eighth Amendment,

21

because vague, aggravating circumstances -- vague,

22

aggravating circumstance increases the risk of arbitrary

23

and capricious sentencing, and therefore it gives no

24

guidance.

25

Did California choose to use an aggravating

And we know by those factors what happened here.

We look to the record.

substantially outweigh the mitigating circumstances, and

the penalty should be death.

There was one other, the opposite conclusion coming to

That was the death verdict.

12

The instructions from the court -- as, Justice

13

Kennedy, you just referred to how important they are when

14

they come from the court -- told the jury to weigh the

aggravating and mitigating circumstances, to assign a

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Gillingham, how could the

21

vagueness of one of those factors produce any more random

decisions than not giving the jury any factors at all and

MR. GILLINGHAM:

QUESTION:

MR. GILLINGHAM:

QUESTION:

On the contrary, Your Honor.

You think it's more random.
On the contrary.

The vague factor is more random than

10

saying do what you like, we won't tell you any factors at

11

all.

12

MR. GILLINGHAM:

Your Honor is referring

13

basically to Georgia, in the sense of the jury is allowed,

14

after the aggravating circumstance is found, to rely on

15

their own common understanding, deliberations,

16

discussions.

17

though not required, but California has chosen to give the

18

jury a menu, a shopping list perhaps, a lens to evaluate

19

the evidence through.

20

vagueness, it distorts the process.

21

But what happens in California -- again

QUESTION:

And when that lens is distorted by

But isn't there a significant

22

difference between the use that California makes of the

23

factors and the use that we have -- the uses that we have

24

been concerned with in past cases when we have said that

2

the weighing process.
And isn't -- in our prior cases, wasn't our

3

rationale that the fact that the State had identified a

4

certain kind of propositional aggravating circumstance,

5

like it was cruel, there was torture in the commission and

6

so on -- the fact that the State has weighed -- has

7

identified a statement like that, when found to be true as

8

an aggravating factor, and that statement is also vague so

9

that, in fact, it's kind of a wild card, we really never

10

can tell whether it's really true or not, it is the use of

11

that factor which the State has given emphasis to by its

12

identification in the narrowing stage which is what skews

13

the weighing process.

14

But here the aggravating factors that are being

15

used at the weighing stage are not the aggravating factors

16

which have been used at the narrowing stage.

17

entirely different set of propositions.

18

MR. GILLINGHAM:

It's an

And it's exactly what was

19

argued in Stringer, Your Honor, and that is not the

20

distinguishing point because if that were the case,

21

basically Stringer would have overruled Zant.

22

Zant, as in Stringer, there were otherwise two valid

23

aggravating factors.

25

QUESTION:

Because in

No, but the point in Stringer was --

there was no problem at the --by the use of an

2

because you had a nongrave -- nonvague aggravator, that's

3

all.

4

using an aggravator which the State had identified as

5

being especially important despite its vagueness, that

6

skewed the weighing process.

7

The problem in Stringer, as I recall it, was that by

Here you're not using the same aggravator to

8

weigh that you did to narrow, and you're not using an

9

aggravator which states a proposition like "it was cruel."

10

Instead, you're using an aggravator that simply looks to

11

subject matter, and aren't those the two distinguishing

12

factors between this case and Stringer?

13

MR. GILLINGHAM:

They are distinguishing without

14

a difference, Your Honor, in this -- in some ways, but in

15

other ways, to use Justice Kennedy's description in

16

Stringer, it's worse in the penalty phase determination,

17

it's absolutely worse.

18

sitting there needing the guidance, just about ready to

19

decide life or death, and we give them not a narrow -- not

20

a narrow aggravator, as all the States have, we give them

not even a singly directed aggravator such as in Maynard,

the "heinous, cruel, and atrocious" or the "outrageously

vile," and those are vague.

1

In other words, we identify a subject

2

matter which it is relevant for them to consider, and that

3

is exactly the same thing that the jury in a State like

4

Georgia, which does not go through a formal weighing

5

process, can do.

the jury in effect can consider everything it knows in

deciding whether or not, at the penalty phase, to impose

that penalty.

QUESTION:

Once the narrowing is done in Georgia,

And what California, it seems to me, is doing is

10

to say you may consider the following subjects:

circumstances, and so on.

13

to be unconstitutional too, which I think is the

implication of Justice Scalia's question.

It seems to me that if we

Georgia -- what happens is those States that choose --

17

those States that choose to give the jury additional

18

direction, additional guidance, have a responsibility to

19

give guidance that's not illusory.

20

For example, in this case --

21

QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't it be more precise to

22

say that if they are going to identify certain subject

23

matters which ought to be considered at the weighing

24

stage, they at least ought to be relevant subject matters.

this -- isn't the instruction to the jury basically,

MR. GILLINGHAM:

12

But to weigh factors -- what we

13

have to keep in mind, Your Honor, is the difference

14

between the evidence, the data base, and the fact that

15

these factors are a lens through which the jury is told to

16

look at this evidence.

17

QUESTION:

In juror -- in Georgia --

what you mean.

that it is obviously relevant to the decision that they

They view

age as -- the age of 19 at the commission of crime as

aggravating or as mitigating.

3

identification of that subject as something to be

considered or in the instructions given here that make it

aggravating or mitigating.

is that you can't tell from the instructions whether

you're supposed to treat it as aggravating or mitigating.

I don't see anything in the

In fact, one of the arguments

All the State is doing is saying

MR. GILLINGHAM:

Your Honor, factor (k) tells

12

the jury to consider the mitigating or extenuating

13

circumstances of the crime.

14

QUESTION:

Uh-hum.

15

MR. GILLINGHAM:

If there's going to be any

16

mitigation element to the factors in California, it's

17

going to be in factor (k), which is the fifth factor in

18

our case, in Tuilaepa.

19

QUESTION:

Uh-hum.

20

MR. GILLINGHAM:

That's where the entrance of

21

mitigation is.

There's no question that (a) is the

22

aggravation from a common sense understanding, but the

23

difference between jury -- from Georgia and California is

California has taken upon itself to give additional

illusory fashion so that it's not inconsistent with

2

Georgia; Georgia is different.

3

QUESTION:

So you agree that California could

4

have dispensed entirely with the list of factors, since it

5

narrows it in a different way.

6

MR. GILLINGHAM:

7

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

You have -- I want to be clear on

8

that point.

You are not challenging in any way the

9

determination of the death-eligible category, that is the

10

factors that go into determining who then gets to the

11

penalty stage.

12

MR. GILLINGHAM:

I'm not, Your Honor.

If I

13

understand, we're talking about the special circumstances,

14

what we call special circumstances.

15
16

QUESTION:

Yes.

Do you think that's an adequate

way of defining the death-eligible category?

17

MR. GILLINGHAM:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. GILLINGHAM:

Absolutely.

Okay.
And, in fact, many of those

20

factors are actually taken to the penalty phase in many of

the weighing States and called aggravating circumstances

in the weighing phase.

circumstances of the crime, that is heinous, atrocious,

QUESTION:

Yeah, and what was wrong with it is

8

that it gave the illusion that you were stating a

proposition about that case which was capable of being

10

shown to be true or false, and because of the vagueness of

11

the statement that really wasn't true.

not presenting the jury with a statement which they can

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD W. GILLINGHAM

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER TUILAEPA (RESUMED)

8

MR. GILLINGHAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

9

Justice Souter, in California there simply is no

10

way, given the verdict, given the instructions, that this

11

jury didn't believe that as a general absolute principal,

12

that the aggravating factors were critical.
Two, they had to know.

13

That's one.

Indeed, they couldn't

14

know anything else, but they had to put some value on

15

those factors and they had to weigh them.

16

fact -- to the extent that they had to weigh --

17

QUESTION:

And, in the

Well, they had -- it's clear that

18

they had to weigh the subjects which the so-called factors

19

referred to, no question about that, but isn't it true

20

that the factors were different from the kinds of factors

21

which are expressed in just propositions of fact like it

22

was cruel?

23

MR. GILLINGHAM:

I think not, Your Honor, other

24

than to the extent that they're much more vague and

25

illusory.

QUESTION:

1

They're much more vague in the sense

2

that they, generally speaking at least, do not state

3

propositions which the jury has to find in order to

4

address those subjects.
MR. GILLINGHAM:

I don't understand.

says you may or should consider the age of the defendant

10

As it stands now, the California scheme

in the process of doing your weighing.

11

MR. GILLINGHAM:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

It doesn't tell you whether that age

13

should be regarded as mitigating or as aggravating.

14

might have said you may determine whether the defendant

15

was at an age of youthful indiscretion, or you should

16

determine whether the defendant was at an age of youthful

17

indiscretion.

have required the jury to make what seemed like, at least,

a finding of fact; he was young and indiscreet or he

wasn't young and indiscreet.

aggravating factors; he was young and indiscreet.

it's worth.

2

so far as the California statute is concerned, and it

3

seems to me that that is a distinction from the Stringer

4

cases.

5

It may be aggravating, it may be mitigating,

MR. GILLINGHAM:

Practically speaking, what

6

happens in the court is that each and every one of those

7

factors are aggravating or argued aggravating, as you've

8

seen in the amicus briefs, I'm sure.

9

QUESTION:

And --

And argued mitigating too.

I mean,

10

the defendant can get up and say, okay, consider his age,

11

whatever it was, 19.

12

he was young and he's going to get older and wiser as he

13

gets older.

14

aggravating affect as that side saw fit.

That's a mitigating factor, because

Each side could argue the mitigating or

15

MR. GILLINGHAM:

16

I have made it time and time again.

17

if he was old enough to do this crime, for me to stand up

18

and successfully argue -- I have men on death row who can

19

testify to the efficacy of my argument in those regards.

20

Each and every time, Your Honor, there's only one factor

21

really that is mitigating for the defendant, and that's

22

(k) .

And the argument that

And that's (k) .

QUESTION:

MR. GILLINGHAM:

And I have made that argument.

Which is (k)?

QUESTION:

I see.

MR. GILLINGHAM:

-- And now added through common

law with the other background record, et cetera, to

satisfy Lockett.
QUESTION:

6

So you're saying if they consider the

7

subjects of everything up to (k) as a practical matter,

8

they're going to be considering aggravating factors.

9

MR. GILLINGHAM:
QUESTION:

10

Absolutely.

All right.

What then -- let me ask

11

you another question.

Does the list from (a) through (j)

12

pretty much exhaust the possibility -- the field of

13

relevant considerations except for mitigation?

14

MR. GILLINGHAM:

15

QUESTION:

MR. GILLINGHAM:

17

Do they single anything out?

MR. GILLINGHAM:

QUESTION:
those factors,

Yeah, in the list of factors --

(a) through (j).

Yes.

If the jury really considers all of

Yes.

Will it have considered pretty much

not my case.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Gillingham, your comment about

15

age being only an aggravating factor, or at least not

16

being a good mitigating factor, certainly would contradict

17

a couple of our cases where we've said that -- like

18

Edmunds, where the court has said that the jury has to be

19

permitted to consider age as a mitigating factor in the

20

sense of youth.

MR. GILLINGHAM:

7

it is an uphill battle in each and every case, given the

8

fact that when you get there you have a first-degree

9

murder with a special circumstance.

It's one thing for me

10

to argue that, especially without the age factor being

11

there at all, and it seems to me that's fair game and a

12

jury on their own can consider that and do with it what

13

they will.

MS. LASCHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
I'd like to return to the subject of the process

17

the jury in California is directed to go through, because

18

I think the process that is involved in these cases may

19

answer some of Justice Souter's concerns.

20

The jury is told that it must weigh 11

21

enumerated factors.

And, indeed, in Mr. Proctor's case it

22

was told that the result of its weighing process would

23

produce a mandatory result.

24

numerating factors leads us into the constitutional

25

difficulty .that existed both in the Tuilaepa case and even

And so the very nature of the

1

more so in the Proctor case, because now you're not merely

2

telling the jury to look at the wealth of evidence it's

3

already heard and make a determination about that and see

4

if anything mitigating outweighs it, which is what you

5

would have in a Georgia scheme.
But you're telling the jury to put the factor --

6

7

factors -- as it were, the evidence into little boxes and

8

to look at each one separately and to give independent

9

weight to each of those boxes, however much or little

10

weight the jury chooses, but still to give them weight,

11

put them on the balance.
And so the jury has to go through a tangible

12

13

process.

We know that happened in the Proctor case

14

because the prosecutor told the jury it was going to do

15

that, the defense lawyer told the jury it was going to do

16

that.

17

that, but it said to the jury, here are the written

MS. LASCHER:

All right, the Proctor case.

I

3

think I would choose Georgia, and this is why.

4

where the jury is not given any kind of direction except

5

that it's given mitigating evidence to weigh, when the

6

jury goes into the jury room there's a collective process.

7

That's what we count on, that's why we have all this

8

litigation about jury instructions in death penalty cases.

In Georgia

The jurors have to negotiate with each other, they have to
10

look one another in the eye, they have to decide, okay,

11

now we're really at the crunch, what are we going to do,

12

is this murder a serious enough one to impose a death

13

penalty and not another.

14

If you give the jury a list of factors or any

15

other kind of instructions that guide them through a

giving them a yardstick gives them a sense of confidence.

2

should consider the following subject matters, factors,

3

whatever they might call them, as being relevant when you

go through the weighing process.

5

MS. LASCHER:

I think the key to the answer,

6

Your Honor, is the phrase "the weighing process."

7

as soon as you direct the jury to do something with those

subject matters or factors or whatever you call them,

that's where you'll get into trouble.

If you say consider --

Georgia says you're supposed to weigh

all -- in effect, all the evidence that you deem to be

relevant.

same thing, except that California would identify the

16

particular subjects of that relevant evidence which pretty

much canvass the universe of relevance.

18

And on my hypo, California would be saying the

MS. LASCHER:

Well, actually, I disagree

somewhat because what Georgia does is it says you shall

20

weigh these subject matters, but it doesn't say the thing

that California says, which is if you find that

22

aggravating outweigh mitigating, that you shall impose the

juries are not going to say we find the mitigating

2

evidence overwhelming here, but we think we'll impose the

3

death penalty anyway.

4

MS. LASCHER:

No, I think the jury can decide in

5

Georgia for whatever reason, because it is exercising this

6

negotiating function, this conscience function, not to

7

impose the death penalty because at the end of the process

8

there's no consequence attached to the weighing.

what juries will, in fact, do as a matter of common sense,

10

Your Honor may be right, and there may be many cases where

they will come to the end of the process and they'11 say

notion of the illusory factor on death's side of the

Because if you have, let's say, 20 juries

conclude the defendant should not be put to death.

14

And it is inevitable in our constitutional

coming to totally opposite conclusions, 10 one way and 10

circumstances do you think it would be true that they

14

would come to their disparate conclusions based on the way

15

the factor was treated by the statute as opposed to their

16

view of the facts?

17

Now, some jurors may consider it

MS. LASCHER:

Well, I think we have two perfect

18

cases to illustrate that, Your Honor, because Mr. Proctor

1

was 20 and Mr. Tuilaepa was 21 at the times of their

20

respective crime, and in the Proctor case the jury was --

21

the prosecutor stipulated that age was mitigating, and in

the Tuilaepa case the prosecutor argued it was

23

aggravating, and their prior records were not that

dissimilar.

of the way the California statute is written or the way

the factors are described for the jury, as distinct from

the way the jury, and before them counsel in the case,

view the facts?
MS. LASCHER:

6

Because -- I think -- actually, I

think the State does need to take a position, even on age,

but certainly on some other factors such as accomplice

status.

Well, and that may be -- I don't mean

to cut you off from that.

concerned, you really can't say, can you, that the

articulation of the so-called age factor, as distinct from

14

the way the jury views age in a given case, is going to

15

tip the jury's view of age one way or another?

MS. LASCHER:

But I -- so far as facts are

You can't say it in an abstract

fashion.

almost universally in California murder trials, you can,

I -- prosecutors do argue that and

MS. LASCHER:

Yes, they try.

of the circumstances of the crime, touchy as that is,

because apart from the failure to label the fact -- let me

Let me talk about labeling the factors for a

we should do with age.

would be to eliminate factor (a) and then to label the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM GEORGE PRAHL

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. PRAHL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The key to a resolution of the issue before this

7

Court was explored during a series of questions to Mr.

8

Gillingham posed by Justice Souter dealing with the

9

differences between the Cal -- between California's unique

10

death penalty statute and that of the Mississippi statute

11

at issue in this Court's Stringer case.

12

It's critical to an understanding of the case

13

before you that you understand -- that the fundamental

14

difference between these two statutes is examined.

15

Mississippi, the narrowing factor is found at the penalty

16

trial and plays a dual role.

17

18

propositional aggravating circumstance not only narrows,

19

but it also plays a role within the jury's sentencing

determination.

These are the

2

penalty trial.

This is at the start of the

This is a significant difference.

Like the aggravating circumstances, as they're

3
4

called, in Georgia, the special circumstances in

5

California, these narrowing factors virtually disappear at

6

the sentencing phase, and instead the jury is told at the

7

sentencing phase to consider, take into account, and be

8

guided by a number of relevant factors on the issue that's

9

before the jury at that time, whether death is the

10

appropriate punishment.
QUESTION:

11

General Prahl, perhaps I shouldn't

12

take your time with this, but I do want you -- at the end

13

of the guilt phase these become death-eligible if any one

14

of the circumstances have been found.

15

MR. PRAHL:

16

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Am I -- do I read correctly

17

circumstance 3, that if he's found guilty of two second

18

degree murder offenses, he's death eligible?

19

MR. PRAHL:

No, Your Honor, that would not be

20

correct.

That's one point we did want to clarify.

21

notion about the -- while it's not at issue here, I think

22

it deserves a comment, and that is, for example, ordinary

23

premeditated deliberate first degree murder, premeditation

So what a lot of people would regard as the

most -- one of the more serious forms of first degree

4

murder, premeditation and deliberation, in the absence of

the commission of a felony, in absence of one of the other

7

alone is not enough to make a defendant death-eligible.

11

So, given that explanation, could

California add to one of the factors for the jury to

MR. PRAHL:

homicidal conduct or consented to the homicidal act?

What would be a prototypical example of a case

MR. PRAHL:

Oh, that's probably a situation

where there's some type of drug deal where there's two or

10

more people involved in some sort of criminal activity and

11

something goes wrong. It's -- all of these factors are

12

anticipatory in the sense that they -- what they have

13

tried to do is anticipate the circumstances that may arise

14

in a capital case, to give the jury some kind of guidance.

15

When California's -- the legislative history of

16

the California statute is interesting in that California

17

basically adopted this format in 1977 as a result of this

Court's 1976 -- the five cases decided in 1976.

19

California's statutory scheme is basically a hybrid.

20

you want to have to -- if you have to give it a name, we'd

look through -- and you can best characterize California

not as a weighing State, not as a special issue State like

There are comparisons all through both this Court's prior

California tried to draw on what this Court had
said were the constitutional aspects of a death penalty-

places the special circumstance determination, the

eligibility determination in the guilt phrase, begins with

13

a penalty phase where the defendant is completely

death-eligible, and then gives the jury something to look

at in arriving at that decision.

The Court has specifically addressed the issues

that California is not a weighing State within the meaning

sentencing factors, as the California Supreme Court

2

announced them, are much closer to this Court's Fourteenth

Delaware v. Dawson basically held, that when you look at

right down to relevance is a question of Fourteenth

feel is unwarranted since that is basically covered
