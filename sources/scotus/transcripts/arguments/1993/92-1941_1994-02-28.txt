ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case concerns whether Congress may promptly

and retroactively correct a palpable drafting defect in

12

tax legislation.

Respondent is the executor of Willametta

section 2057 of the Internal Revenue Code, established a

estate's sale of stock to the corporate issuer's employee

proceeds of the sale.

$2-and-a-half-million estate tax savings.

5

The claimed deduction resulted in a

Now, applied as Respondent did in this case,

6

section 2057 would permit the executor of any estate to

7

entirely eliminate its estate tax obligation simply by

8

purchasing and reselling corporate securities after the

9

decedent's death.

As contemporary financial commentators

10

noted, this application of the statute would, and I quote,

11

"be the tax loophole you could drive a truck through."

12

Congress obviously did not intend in 1986 to

13

eliminate the Federal estate tax.

14

section 2057, interpreted in this manner, could have that

15

effect, the Internal Revenue Service promptly proposed an

16

amendment to the statute --

that the statute should have been more explicit.

9

Mr. Jones, do you have many cases

There are I believe three other --

if cases like this you are talking about cases under

10

section 2057 -- I believe there are three other cases, out

11

of the thousands of estate tax returns that were filed

12

during this period, three other instances where executors

13

sought to take what we would regard as this aggressive

14

interpretation of the statute.
QUESTION:

15

Do you think it was a mistake in

16

interpretation of the statute?

17

MR. JONES:

Chief Justice Rehnquist, our

18

position is not that it was unreasonable to take this tax

19

position.

20

Eustis said, a lawyer's passion for technical analysis of

21

the statutory language should always be diluted by

22

distrust of a result that appears too good to be true.

23

Our position is that, as Professors Bitker and

We think that this executor, in seeking this tax

24

windfall, should have known and probably did believe that

25

his hoped-for windfall should be diluted by distrust of

QUESTION:

result if that were a proper construction of the statute?

MR. JONES:

He should look at this as -- as the

on it until it was corrected?

You would be embarking on a new

1

constitutional approach to these cases.

20

we really need to focus in on what -- what was the issue

21

that Congress had to address, and what's the

22

constitutional issue for this Court to address?
The court -- the

And I think that

th Circuit held that this

briefly retroactive amendment violated the due process

clause.

Under the due process clause, legislation must

It must reflect a genuine

exercise of a valid legislative power.
In the Pension Benefit and the General Motors

cases, this Court held specifically that retroactive

MR. JONES:

Well, that's -- that's a question

21

that I don't think that can be answered better than the

Court did in Welch v. Henry.

23

v. Henry was, assuming a tax could go so far back to make

24

that objection valid.

reasons why that kind of hypothetical really shouldn't be

answered in the abstract.

in Welch, where -- where the tax was imposed retroactively

QUESTION:

The Court declined to do that

But Welch -- Welch was a different

6

case from this.

The Court observed, as I recall, that the

7

taxpayer would not have changed his conduct.

8

different would have happened.

9

MR. JONES:

Nothing

Well, actually, in Welch, Chief

10

Justice Rehnquist, the taxpayer contended that he

11

purchased and held Wisconsin dividend stock in reliance on

12

the economic inducement of the deduction.

13

Court held was that a taxpayer should be prepared for the

14

possibility of a retroactive change in the tax laws.

15

QUESTION:

And what the

But didn't the Court also observe the

16

fact that the receipt of income would have gone on

17

regardless of what the statutory provision was?

18

MR. JONES:

I think the -- the Court did make

19

the point that the dividends weren't going to be returned

20

just because taxes were owed on them.

21

really address the fact that what the Court -- that the

22

issue -- an issue in Welch was the taxpayer's claim of

23

reliance on the statute.

QUESTION:

observation, you can say it's dicta, but you can argue

1

that it wouldn't have made that observation if it didn't

2

think it was of some importance.

3

MR. JONES:

Well, what wasn't dicta in -- in --

4

clearly in Welch was its statement that taxpayers must be

5

prepared for the possibility of retroactive changes, and

6

that there is no injustice in Congress, upon first

7

learning of the effect of the tax, making a retroactive

8

revision.

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. JONES:

Then there's no reliance rule ever?
There is no prior notice rule, and

11

there is no reliance rule, nor is there a detrimental

12

reliance rule or a reasonable reliance rule.

13

Appeals --

14

QUESTION:

The Court of

But they -- they were talking about

15

taxpayers generally, and not taxpayers -- it does seem to

16

me that there is something quite different about a

17

provision that is written as an incentive

to induce

18

taxpayers to do something that is against

their economic

19

interest; namely, in these cases, to sell

stock to these

20

employee stock ownership plans, which will be sold at less

21

than what you could get elsewhere, obviously, because the

22

plan knows that

23

has a real incentive

24
25

it's -to

it's buying it from someone who
sell it tothem.

Now, you dangle this in front of the taxpayer
and say, take a loss in order to get the tax benefit.

And

then, later, you take away the tax benefit.

possibilities are wonderful for achieving all sorts of

3

governmental program.

4

these other cases I think.
MR. JONES:

5

The

That's quite different from any of

Well, it's not really different from

6

Welch, because in Welch, the State of Wisconsin had

7

adopted a -- an incentive for ownership of Wisconsin

8

corporate stock by exempting only Wisconsin dividends from

9

the tax.

Frankly,'the constitutional justifications for

10

the retroactive revision of the -- of section 2057 are

11

much stronger than they were in Welch.

12

Wisconsin had simply changed its law because it decided it

13

wanted more revenues and that this was a good way to do

14

it.

15

Because, in Welch,

In this case, Congress made the retroactive

16

revision of a tax to avoid a glaring loophole that was a

17

matter of some public discussion, and was designed to

18

avoid misuse of public legislation.

19

this Court's opinion in Heinssen and Graham and Goodcell,

20

it was designed to cure a defect in the administration of

21

the tax laws.

capricious.

And there is --

QUESTION:

2

Mr. Jones, that's what I'm trying to

3

determine, is how far you carry that.

You have given us

4

so far the "too good to be true" test.

5

this and you said, oh, my goodness, I'm going to get

6

two-and-a-half million in the deduction in exchange for a

7

$600,000 loss -- too good to be true.

If you looked at

Suppose, to take this very situation, Congress

8

9

had said, ESOP's have had it good enough, and we're going

10

to even take away the decedent who owns this share, we're

11

going to take that away six months later and make that

12

retroactive.

And let's -- and we have the same

3

constitutional question.

4

originally -- as you say, it should have been all along --

5

to qualify the decedent must own the share.

into the new year, Congress decides it's given away too

much.

And so, that's one of the things it's going to

Would there be a constitutional problem?
MR. JONES:

Well, I think that there would be a

21

constitutional issue.

And, again, what this Court has

22

said in several of these cases is that you look to the

23

facts and circumstances of the particular case to

24

determine whether the statute, the amending or repealing

25

or retroactive statute, was a rational means of addressing

Well, was it in that case?
In which case?

In the hypothetical?

The case that Justice Ginsburg just

put to you.
MR. JONES:

Well, I'm -- I would like to be able

to tell you that there is a clear answer to that.

view, there is a clear answer to that.

would be no different than Wisconsin retroactively, for

11

income tax law.

12

QUESTION:

Then isn't the -- isn't the answer

13

simply that you can't seem to think of -- of an example,

14

or maybe we can't seem to think of an example which would

15

ever run afoul of the rule.

16

arguing for really is that so long as Congress at least

17

has some public purpose in mind, there's no limit on what

18

Congress can do.

19

MR. JONES:

And the rule that you're

I -- I think that so long as what is

20

-- what Congress has enacted is either within the power to

21

raise and levy taxes, or within the necessary and proper

22

clause under Article I of the Constitution, that that

23

resolves the question of whether this was a rational means

24

of furthering a legitimate public interest.

feature never, as such, combines with any other set of

2

facts to invalidate the retroactive exercise?
MR. JONES:

4

QUESTION:

It seems to me that that's the

implication of what you're saying.

MR. JONES:

that.

mentioned, which is there are good reasons for the Court

I

don't think --

I would not say that, personally.

And the first is -- is the one I've already

not to try to answer that question in the abstract.
QUESTION:

Yes, but the answer to that is there

are good reasons not to adopt a test, the meaning of which

we do not understand.

14

of your test.

15

MR. JONES:

And I do not understand the limit

Well, the test that I'm proposing,

16

if you will, for the Court to adopt is a test that the

17

Court has adopted in a string of maybe 20 cases in this

18

century in which it has upheld retroactive tax cases as

19

not being arbitrary or capricious.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Even -- even with that pedigree, I

still do not understand.
MR. JONES:

Right.

Well, there -- there is a --

23

there is a way to think about this that even in describing

25

to nail down the theory, if you will, on this subject.

1

But there is a way to think about this issue, about the

2

limits of retroactivity.

3

One way would be to say that the power that

4

Congress draws upon is the power to raise and levy taxes,

5

and that a -- the concept of a tax may itself have some

6

substance that avoids an unduly retroactive result.

7

is to say, there may be some type of contemporaneity

8

within the very concept of a tax to distinguish it from a

9

-- from what the Court described in -- in Unt -- rather in

10

Nichols -- as a taking.
But there is no jurisprudence within this

11
12

That

Court's decisions on that subject.

And there is a good

reason for that.'

4

Congress doesn't go around, willy-nilly, doing these kind

of hypothetical things.

can retroactively delete any deduction it gives as long as

MR. ALLEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

9

The fundamental issue is the one that the Court

10

has been questioning, and that is, whether there is a due

11

process constraint on the retroactive application of the

12

taxing power.

13

the case before you is one with very unusual facts, which

14

clearly demonstrate that the limit can be exceeded.

15
16
17
18

I will suggest that there is a limit; that

The critical element here is the element of
specific inducement.
I will close by addressing the Government's
siren song that it was simply too good to be true.

19

As Justice O'Connor reminded us two years ago in

20

the Romein decision, retroactive legislation presents more

21

serious problems of unfairness than prospective

22

legislation, because it can deprive citizens of legitimate

23

expectations and upset settled transactions.
