ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH I. SIDLE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. SIDLE:

9

We'll hear argument

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

10

The application of the dual standard for the

11

award of attorney's fees to petitioner Fogerty in this

12

case results in a perversion of the policies of the

13

Copyright Act.

14

an implicit assumption about the nature of the parties to

15

a Copyright Act, to wit, that the plaintiff is a copyright

16

author who is seeking to sue a business enterprise that

17

has copied his work, but in this case, we have only one

18

author.

The Ninth Circuit standard is based upon

That's John Fogerty.
He had a copyright, a work that he said was an

19
20

original creation, that was not copied.

21

that copyright by being the prevailing party in a

22

copyright case.

23

was authorized in section 505, and the court denied those

24

fees.

justifies the distinction against this author based upon

2

his status as a defendant.

3

there be under the copyright laws that the plaintiff in

4

the case, a copyright owner, had Fantasy won the case,

5

would be awarded its fees, but Fogerty, the author in the

6

case, would not be awarded his fees even though he had

7

done exactly what the copyright laws asked him to do,

8

which is create a new original work?
QUESTION:

9

What possible policy could

Mr. Sidle, of course, this Court has

10

to face up the Christiansburg case, where virtually

11

identical language on attorney's fees was interpreted to

12

suggest that we don't grant attorney's fees under it as

13

respondents --

14

MR. SIDLE:

15

QUESTION:

But the Christiansburg --- so I think really we need to face

16

up to what differences there are that would compel a

17

different result here.

18

MR. SIDLE:

Well, I think there's dramatic

19

differences between civil rights cases and copyright

20

cases.

21

issues, different types of parties, and different

22

policies.

recognition on the part of Congress to a dual standard.

The legislative history of this act is virtually silent as

4

QUESTION:

Well, do you think Christiansburg was

correctly decided?

5

MR. SIDLE:

Christiansburg was correctly decided

6

in the civil rights context, but I don't think this Court

7

can carry over from the civil rights context to the

8

commercial context of the copyright law area.

9

QUESTION:

Well, you say civil rights context.

10

What does that mean?

11

statutes are considered something special?
MR. SIDLE:

QUESTION:

MR. SIDLE:

I think

What's your authority for that?
I think just a general principle

What's your authority from this

MR. SIDLE:

Well, I don't know that I can say

it hasn't faced that issue.

attorney's fees.

It then has a whole line of cases in the

2

civil rights area, but the civil rights area is a concept

3

of a private attorney general bringing an action for

4

remedying social problems and class-wide problems.
The copyright area is typically a dispute

5
6

between two owners of property.

The typical copyright

7

case is two copyright proprietors, one trying to stop the

8

other from marketing their product, and that kind of

9

property dispute should not use the analogy from a civil

10

rights case where you're invoking principles of class

11

discrimination and concepts of private attorney generals.

12

There's no concept of a private attorney general.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Sidle, will you remind us where

14

the language showed up first, because it is identical

15

language?

16

MR. SIDLE:

The language showed up first in the

17

Copyright Act.

18

'64 act, and then this Court had its Alyeska decision, and

19

then there was the '76 Civil Rights Attorney's Fee Act

20

that Congress enacted in response to that.

21

I believe the first Civil Rights Act was a

It's only in the very recent past that there's

22

been any suggestion from even the courts that have the

23

dual standard, and I think they're just make-weight,

24

drawing an analogy to the civil rights statute.

There's

1

plaintiffs in a copyright case as being like private

2

attorney generals.
And I can just point to cases -- and there's

3
4

also a happenstance nature to this.

Who happens to be the

5

plaintiff in a copyright case can be any one of a number

6

of parties.

7

example, Mills Music.

8

music copyright royalties interpleaded the funds.

9

contesting parties were both defendants in an interpleader

This Court has had cases before it -- for

10

action.

11

prevail and there's a dispute there over whether the

12

termination of a copyright under the '76 act terminated

13

the music publishing company's right to royalties?

14

How do you decide who's the plaintiff if they

You also had the statute case, Community of Non-

15

Violence v. Reid, which was a declaratory relief action.

16

It was a question of who owned the statue, and it involved

17

the question of a work for hire.

18

could have filed that action.

19

QUESTION:

Either of those parties

Mr. Sidle, isn't it true that in

20

190 -- this statute was enacted in 1909. Isn't that when

21

the language got in?

22

MR. SIDLE:

23

QUESTION:

Yes.
And at that time, isn't it fair to

24

assume that the typical case Congress was thinking about

25

was sort of a garden variety infringement suit, or

something?
MR. SIDLE:

2

I think if we're looking back to

3

1909, the proper thing -- the proper motive to project on

4

Congress was that it was adopting the British Rule.

5

have an American Rule that parties bear their own fees,

6

and every first-year lawyer knows that the alternative to

7

that is the British Rule.

8

unusual to have statutes awarding attorney's fees.

9

Congress decided --

10

QUESTION:

At that time it was somewhat

But to argue for the British Rule,

11

that statute has been on the books for 87 years, or

12

whatever it is, and nobody's ever adopted the British

13

Rule.

14

MR. SIDLE:

We

When you say, nobody's ever adopted

15

the British Rule, we cite the Lewys case in our brief

16

which says that that's what Congress did, and that's one

17

of the pre-1976 act cases that Fantasy relies upon as

18

authority that there was a dual standard.

19

fact, there are judges who interpreted Congress as doing

20

that.

MR. SIDLE:

generally awards attorney's fees as costs just as a matter

of course to the prevailing party.

3

some other circuits, do we not, that would say there is no

presumption of the award of attorney's fees to a

MR. SIDLE:

What is it,

we have to the Copyright Act.

pursue is whether you take the position that we should

course, the British Rule
QUESTION:

-- or do you approach it without any

such presumption?

4

MR. SIDLE:

I believe that as a matter of

5

general course -- there would be exceptions, but generally

the prevailing party should be awarded their fees.

7

believe that's what Congress intended.

8

consistent with the policy of the Copyright Act.

think -QUESTION:

10

I believe that's

in 1909, why did it use such neutrally permissive

12

language?
MR. SIDLE:

14

QUESTION:

15

I

If that was the intention of Congress

11

13

I

Well, I think that's -I mean, the British Rule is a lot

stronger than "may also award."

16

MR. SIDLE:

Well, I think that when we talk

17

about generally award, or usually award, it's a bit

18

slippery.

19
20
21

We're not talking about an open -QUESTION:

Well, it's less slippery than leaving

it in an entirely permissive posture.
MR. SIDLE:

Well, but that's also in the context

22

of granting an authority where there's very few statutes

23

that give that authority.

somewhat greater precision, if that's what they intended

to do.
MR. SIDLE:

2

Well, I think that what this -- this

3

Court is writing on a clean slate as far as what it should

4

do in guiding the lower district courts, and I think --

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Sidle, in addition to the "may"

6

language, it's a double -- it's in its discretion.

If you

7

just had "may," then your argument of the British Rule

8

might be stronger, but "the Court in its discretion
may" --

10

MR. SIDLE:

Well then, what's the rationale for

11

the Ninth Circuit adopting the British Rule with respect

12

to plaintiffs?

13

at the Lanham Act and the Patent Act, where it says,

14

"under exceptional circumstances the court may award

15

fees," intended that to be the standard there.

16

I submit to you that Congress, in looking

What has happened in the Ninth Circuit is, it's

17

done two things.

18

adopted the British Rule, and with respect to defendants

1

they've adopted the Lanham Act and the Patent Act standard

20

for defendants.

21

With respect to plaintiffs they have

QUESTION:

Well, maybe you have a strong

22

argument that whatever rule they adopted ought to be -- it

23

ought to be even-handed, but I don't see how you have an

24

argument that it ought to be the British Rule.

25

MR. SIDLE:

I think -- I think that the

(800) FOR DEPO

1

strongest argument for that comes from the language in the

2

Strauss Report that was submitted to Congress, and I

3

believe it's cited in our reply brief.

4

There were only really two reports given to

5

Congress, the Brown Report and the Strauss Report, and

6

what they say about attorney's fees is very limited, but

7

if the Court reads that language on page 17, I think you

8

come away with basically an idea that at least what was

9

presented to Congress was to award -- a rule that was an

10
11

economic award of making the prevailing party whole.
QUESTION:

But suppose I agree with you that

12

what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, but I

13

don't agree with you that the British Rule was necessarily

14

adopted, I just think that Congress meant to leave it to

15

the trial judge, and the trial judge had a lot of

16

discretion, but he shouldn't load it for one side rather

17

than the other?

18

How do I dispose of this case then?

MR. SIDLE:

Well, I think that you should maybe

19

do a bit more than that and enlighten the district court

20

judges that they should look to the policies of the

21

Copyright Act in determining how to exercise their

22

discretion.

23

QUESTION:

No, but assume -- assume that the

24

only thing I think that the court of appeals has done

25

wrong is to apply a different standard to defendants than

it applies to plaintiffs.

MR. SIDLE:

3

QUESTION:

How do I decide this case?

Well, you reverse this case -Why?

They -- I don't know which

4

standard -- they should apply to both.

5

don't I just affirm and say but, you know, but in the

6

future be sure that you treat plaintiffs and defendants

7

alike?

8

thing I'm sure about is that they shouldn't treat you

9

differently from plaintiffs.

10

I just -- why

I'm not sure they've treated you wrong.

MR. SIDLE:

The only

Well, I think that then the Court

11

will have cases in the future that -- they're all over the

12

place, and I think that you would --

13

QUESTION:

Well, that's how the statute reads --

14

in its discretion. I think the statute meant to leave it

15

to the judge to decide.

16

MR. SIDLE:

Yes, in the context of a Copyright

17

Act that has policies that it's trying to promote.

18

think that in the case where you have a def --

19

QUESTION:

I

Well, is your point that the district

20

judge did not exercise discretion because the district

21

judge didn't believe that he had discretion with respect

22

to a successful defendant?

23

MR. SIDLE:

24

QUESTION:

25

Correct.
So -- but -- am I correct in

understanding that at one time the patent fee-shifting

1

statute had identical words, and then Congress added the

2

qualification,

"in exceptional cases"?

3

MR. SIDLE:

That I don't know.

4

QUESTION:

Of course, the --

5

QUESTION:

In any event, the Lanham Act and the

6

Patent Act are the same except for the addition of the

7

words,

8

9

"in exceptional cases."
MR. SIDLE:

Correct, and the Lanham Act also has

the additional gloss that they put -- shift the burden --

10

normally they award fees to defendants, and not to

11

plaintiffs, so they have a somewhat dual standard.

12

QUESTION:

Of course, the argument is made that

13

even under the present dispensation in the Ninth Circuit,

14

what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,

15

because each of the awards rests upon a fault theory.

16

MR. SIDLE:

17

QUESTION:

That's -Why is that unsound?

I mean, your

18

argu -- your response to that, as I understand it, is

19

well, there may indeed be a fault justifying the award in

20

each of the two sets of circumstances, but that rule

21

should be avoided here because a defendant like my

22

defendant is basically conveying a benefit upon society,

23

but I take it you don't find anything analytically wrong

24

with the theory that there is fault justifying both the

25

plaintiff rule and the defendant rule.

MR. SIDLE:

1

Well, the existing Ninth Circuit

standard has a different standard of fault, if you want to

3

look at it that way.

that you've got to show is either frivolousness or bad

If you're a defendant, the fault

That's a very heavy standard.

QUESTION:

Plaintiff

That's all the fault he has

Because if the plaintiff wins, the

plaintiff has shown that there is a violation of a Federal
statutory policy.

That's the fault.

MR. SIDLE:

Yes, but I think that again gets off

into the concept of wrongdoing in a business statute.

The

statute -- in the copyright area you have defendants -QUESTION:

Well, they're not saying that

5

you're -- you know, that you're morally reprehensible, or

6

that you're going to be dammed for eternity.

7

simply saying that the -- that the defendant who loses has

8

violated a statutory policy, and that's important.

9

just as important as avoiding frivolity by plaintiffs.

20

MR. SIDLE:

They're

It's

Okay, I accept all that, but then

21

that finding of civil liability is a sufficient finding of

22

wrongdoing to award fees to a prevailing plaintiff.

23

You posited some degree of fault.

All he has to

24

do is win, whereas the defendant, who may be promoting

having works in the public domain -- I dare say that over

2

the last 20 years, every new technology case that has come

3

before this Court, this Court has allowed the new

technology to go forward rather than finding a copyright

monopoly.

6

Now, are all of those defendants -- they've done

a public benefit.

They're creating works, they're

8

prevailing parties, they should be entitled to their fees

on the same standards as the plaintiffs, not based on a

disbalanced fault scale, which is what happens right now

11

in the Ninth Circuit.

12

We would suggest that this Court advise the

district courts that in exercising their discretion they

should look to the policies of the Copyright Act, and it's

15

not a question of wrongdoing.

counterclaims, they were successful on those, and there

was much more attorney time and effort spent on those.

Could the net recovery go the other way?
MR. SIDLE:

No, I don't believe so.

I believe

that we're the prevailing party in this case entitled to

our fees, and the fact that there may have been some

motions or other things that they prevailed on along the

way does not turn them into a prevailing party.

Certainly, the Ninth Circuit opinion

of the lower court opinion.

It was interpreted with, I think,

no tilt at all, but interpreted with respect to prevailing

of the patent law, this case with respect to the

The present version of section 505 is

The

1

Fogerty is this morning, that language was construed in

dozens of cases.

3

Case after case, circuit after circuit, the

4

courts grappled with what that language meant, and in

5

every single case of a prevailing defendant, without

6

exception, a prevailing defendant got his attorney's fees

7

if, but only if, the plaintiff's case was objectively

unreasonable, and that is the standard that the Ninth

is here today asking for his attorney's fees.

Is it not true that before '76 costs

MR. ROBBINS:

All of it is discretionary, but

10

what I think that tells you is that the doctrine, the

presumption of ratification -- this goes back, Justice

12

Ginsburg, to your question.

13

ratification is as compelling as you can imagine, because

14

in contrast to many of the Court's other ratification

cases -- and they're as recent as last year's opinion for

the Court in the Keene case, where the presumption that

Congress knows of and ratifies a prevailing construction

of identical language when it reenacts that language, that

Which of the two were they ratifying?

generous pro-plaintiff circuits, so that the premise of

3

the British Rule that petitioner asked for this morning in

fact rests on a false premise even about what's true for

prevailing plaintiffs.

6

But Justice Stevens, to get back to the

7

Register's report, what the Register of Copyrights said in

'61 is that the courts have generally denied award of

attorney's fees where the losing party had solid grounds

10

for litigating his claim or defense, and that is a correct

MR. ROBBINS:

They tended to get them under different

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, let me address that

directly, Justice O'Connor.

It seems to me, first of all,

10

that whatever -- even if it's an even-handed standard, and

11

I dislike the metaphor, because it suggests that the other

12

view is a somehow underhanded -- underhanded standard, and

13

one certainly doesn't want to be called not even-handed --

14

I actually believe -- and this harkens back, Justice

15

Souter, to a point that you made earlier.

16

I actually believe that what is called a dual

17

standard, or what I would prefer to call a standard that

18

says, in essence, that the plaintiff will generally

1

receive its fees unless certain factors are met, whereas a

20

prevailing defendant gets its fees only when the

21

plaintiff's lawsuit is objectively unreasonable or

22

litigated in bad faith, is in fact even-handed in the

23

sense that matters, and let me turn to what I take to be,

24

I submit this morning, the controlling decision of this

25

Court after which one needs, I think, to look no further,

and that is this Court's decision in Zipes.

2

Zipes is a case in which you have a prevailing

3

civil rights plaintiff, a plaintiff that by petitioner's

4

view this morning is advancing a public policy of

5

surpassing, almost unequalled importance.

6

that prevailing plaintiff did not get its attorney's fees.

7

It didn't get it's attorney's fees because the losing

8

intervenor in that case was held not to have commit --be

9

a wrongdoer within the required sense of fee-shifting

Nevertheless,

provisions.
What the Court said in Zipes is that the rule

11
12

for a fee-shifting should respect -- and I'm quoting now

13

from the Court's language -- "the crucial connection

14

between liability for violation of Federal law and

15

liability for attorney's fees under Federal fee-shifting

16

statutes."

I think that is a rule that decides this case.
When a defendant loses a copyright infringement

17
18

case, that constitutes a finding that the defendant

19

violated statutory law, not that he's a bad person, and

20

that gets -- deals with the quibble in the reply brief

that unconscious copying doesn't make you a bad --a

wrongdoer.

Conversely, when a plaintiff acts unreasonably,

3

or litigates in bad faith, or brings a frivolous lawsuit,

4

he, too, is abusing the machinery of the copyright system.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Robbins, that would be a far more

6

impressive argument if that were the rule with respect to

7

patents and trademark, but you concede it isn't, and what

8

I find so difficult to understand is why the regimes for

9

patent and trademark are not the ones that we should look

10

to.
MR. ROBBINS:

11

Well, with respect to trademark,

12

I'd like to suggest, Justice Ginsburg, that this Court's

13

discussion in footnote 19 of the Sony case in which the

14

Court said that the trademark law lacks the necessary

15

kinship with the copyright law to be a workable

16

analogue --

17

QUESTION:

Then let's go to the patent law,

18

where you told me that before the change for exceptional

19

cases it was identical and it was interpreted the same way

20

for prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants.

21

MR. ROBBINS:

Right.

So why isn't that the closest model

for us?

can define some policies in the patent area, for example,

2

the greater ease with which you might innocently infringe

3

on a patent, and so there's a fear that, you know, fee-

4

shifting too readily would sweep up innocent --

QUESTION:

Why is that so?

6

MR. ROBBINS:

7

QUESTION:

-- defendants.

I'm sorry, I have difficulty

8

following that.

It seems in this very case we're talking

9

about the same composer, and a question of whether there

10

was an infringement of something that he himself created.

11

That would be -- I can't imagine anything that's more

12

difficult than that, to determine whether you've been

13

careful enough not to copy yourself too much.

14
15
16

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I'm not suggesting this

wasn't -- you know, a case without its difficulties.
QUESTION:

But is there anything to support your

17

notion that as a general matter it's easier to infringe a

18

patent than a copyright?

19

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I mean, I don't -- I'm not

20

insisting on those differences.

I mean, obviously in the

21

copyright area there is the notion of copying, which

22

obviously has a notion of deliberateness to it, and I

23

think -- I suspect that there is less reason to believe,

24

in the copyright area -- though this may not ultimately be

25

true if you looked at every individual litigation, I

suspect there may be a sense in which, in the copyright

area, you are less likely to sweep within your net

defendants who have acted completely by happenstance and

just happened upon the exact same text, or the exact same

But I think, Justice Ginsburg -- and I really do

6

7

need to recur to this basic point.

8

well, the standard for prevailing defendants is the same

9

as the standard that was applied to Mr. Fogerty.

10
11

In the patent area as

It's the

same.
Patent defendants do not get their fees unless

12

the patent claimed by the plaintiff was objectively

13

unreasonable or frivolous, or litigated in bad faith, and

14

that's the standard on which this case was decided, and

15

that's the standard on which we win, and if anything, the

16

patent law, I think, is good for the piece of the case

17

that I believe is truly before the Court.

18

At the end of the day, it may be that the

19

analogue to the patent cases suggests a closer harmony

20

between plaintiffs and defendants.

21

QUESTION:

That really is hemming in the

22

discretion.

If you just looked at the statute that says

isn't any discretion.

MR. ROBBINS:

That's true, Justice Ginsburg, but

3

truly that was equally the case in the Zipes -- in Zipes

4

as well, where the fee-shifting provision of title VII

5

was -- on its face conferred significant discretion and in

6

fact this Court -- the opinion --

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Robbins, wouldn't you say that it

8

may be not the typical, but in a large number of copyright

9

cases the standard would be met, because it's perfectly

10

obvious there was copying and they just didn't expect to

11

get caught, or something?

12

Aren't there a lot of very small-time suits in

13

this area where there really isn't a defense, and there

14

has to be a motive, but the amount involved isn't enough

15

to justify the recovery unless the copyright owner brings

16

a fee -- gets fees, so that even -- you could say even in

17

a large number of ordinary cases, fees are appropriate in

18

this area for the plaintiff?

19

MR. ROBBINS:

think that's right.

QUESTION:

Yes.

I mean, I think -- I mean, I

That's why it seems to me you might

But there might be more of a question

So it's one thing --

MR. ROBBINS:

-- knowledge of patent law.

11

I think the point, Justice Stevens, that you get

12

to, is that the greater readiness of some circuits to

shift fees towards prevailing plaintiffs reflects a view

14

that is sort of a matter of economic reality.

MR. ROBBINS:

9

The defendant who was saying,

this is fair use

I think that's right.

I think

when a defendant vindicates a fair use he is serving a

10

purpose that is plainly written into section 107 of the

11

act.
But I also think, Justice Ginsburg -- I also

12

13

think that the Ninth Circuit standard allows sufficient

14

adversarial play in the system for just exactly the

15

reasons that this Court in Christiansburg Garment thought

16

the fee-shifting provision of title VII gave defendants a

17

robust -- a sufficient incentive to litigate their

18

legitimate claims.
The fact of the matter is that a defendant in a

19
20

copyright infringement action within the Ninth Circuit

21

standard has all the incentive in the world to do a really

22

good job, and this lawsuit is ample proof of that.

1

MR. ROBBINS:

I think it is true of defendants

2

generally, but I also think that where you have a fee-

3

shifting provision that allows the defendant -- in the

4

event that he shows the plaintiff's case to be objectively

5

unreasonable, that gives him the incentive to fight that

6

much harder to make the requisite showing.

7

I think there's very little evidence that any

8

defendants in copyright infringement cases are hiding

9

their light under a bushel on the ground that they may not

10

have exactly the same fee-shifting standard that

11

prevailing plaintiffs do, and surely that is not true of

12

this petitioner.

13

The fact is that a defendant has the same

14

incentive that this Court thought in Christiansburg

15

Garment was sufficient to warrant the construction of the

16

identical language in section 706(k) of title VII that

17

this Court in Christiansburg Garment construed to have the

18

same standard that the Ninth Circuit applied for

19

prevailing defendants under section 505.

20

Let me just recur again to this Court's

21

admonition that similarly worded fee-shifting provisions

22

ought to be similarly construed, and the most similar fee-

23

shifting provision that this Court has construed is the

24

fee-shifting provision in title VII.

construe it till long after the copyright fee-shifting

2

statute was drafted, so Congress could -- you cannot say

3

Congress could have predicted we would have construed the

4

Civil Rights Act in the future the way we did.

5

MR. ROBBINS:

On the other hand, at the time

6

that the Copyright Act was enacted, they also enacted

7

section 1988, the same Congress, and both of those -- and

8

1988 has also been construed by this Court to have the

9

same standard for prevailing defendants.

10

QUESTION:

But not until after it was passed.

11

MR. ROBBINS:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. ROBBINS:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

But not until after it was enacted.
Well, I think that's right, but I

14

also think that the policies and purposes that this Court

15

identified in Christiansburg Garment, and that explained

16

why that identical language was given exactly the

17

construction that the Ninth Circuit applied to section 505

18

for prevailing defendants, those policies are ones that I

19

suggest transcend the particular statutory provision in

20

which the fee-shifting statute happens to be embedded.

QUESTION:

Oh, I don't know, we spoke in Zipes

22

and we spoke in a number of civil rights cases of private

MR. ROBBINS:

No, I think that's correct,

Justice Scalia, and I don't want to overstate the

similarities, but I also don't have to, because

Christiansburg Garment turns not simply on the metaphor of

private attorneys general, although to be -- not to put

You're going to do it anyway.

MR. ROBBINS:

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. ROBBINS:

I'm going to do it anyway.

I think, in fact, this Court's

13

copyright jurisprudence makes the central point that

14

copyright plaintiffs are suing not only, and for that

surely that's what they do, but also, and more

QUESTION:

Mr. Robbins, do you attribute any

significance to -- the image of the civil rights plaintiff

is the individual alone against the Government, against

the corporation, but that doesn't translate in the

22

copyright and patent area, where, as in this very case,

the plaintiff is a corporation, and the defendant is an

individual, so the two don't fit together very neatly, do

1

MR. ROBBINS:

In fact, Justice Ginsburg,

2

respectfully, I do not attribute much significance to that

3

distinction, and let's step out of the title VII context

4

and turn to 1988.

5

1988, which also has the same language, and also

6

gets construed exactly the way the Ninth Circuit construed

7

section 505 for prevailing defendants -- 1988 is the

8

attorney's fee provision that allows 1983 prevailing

9

plaintiffs to get their attorney's fees, and as Your Honor

10

knows, 1983 has been the engine for recovery for a number

11

of plaintiffs who don't look anything like the typical

12

civil rights individual struggling against the wealthy

13

corporation.

14

Golden State, you know, the Virginia Hospital

15

Association, these are wealthy corporate plaintiffs who

16

had the wherewithal to bring that lawsuit.

17

under 1988 -- 1983, and in some cases have gotten their

18

attorney's fees, and I don't think that the metaphor

translates very well, nor do I think that 505 should be

specially carved out for one type of plaintiff, another

type of defendant.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. SIDLE:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I would like

to respond to a couple of points.
The Zipes case is somewhat difficult to

11

conceptualize as a copyright case, but if we did, I think

12

it would be fairly easy to see that that's a good case

13

that illustrates what the rule should be in copyright

14

cases versus what the rule is in civil rights cases, and I

15

submit that because there's a dual standard in civil

16

rights cases, this Court had its problems in Zipes.

17

If you had had an even-handed standard, it

18

wouldn't have been that difficult, but if we have an

19

intervenor, let's say, in a copyright case that comes in

20

and says, hey, but I have a copyright, and that keeps the

21

plaintiff from bringing this case, and the plaintiff

22

prevails against that, on an even-handed standard he would

23

get his fees.

24

The problem in Zipes was, you in effect had two

25

people that were in the category of the favored plaintiff

1

in a civil rights case, and maybe Justice Blackmun's

2

dissent was correct that the defendant TWA should have won

3

the costs.

That at least would have been consistent with

4

the policy.

But I think that the Zipes case is a strong

5

argument for why, in the copyright area, where you just

6

have businesses fighting over control of literary

7

properties, that there should be an even-handed standard.

8

Now, opposing counsel says that from the patent

9

area we have the law applied that was applied to the

10

defendant in this case, and that's correct.

11

difference is that in the patent law it expressly says

12

that it will only be under exceptional circumstances that

13

fees are awarded, whereas in the copyright law, it just

14

says the court may, without any requirement of exceptional

circumstances.

It's even-handed, and that's what

21

we're asking for, is an even-handed standard, and I think

Justice Ginsburg's point is well-taken, that Congress

decided to change the patent law to make it only

No, but they argued it had been so

went in the statute.

5

MR. SIDLE:

But that, I submit, is -- and I also

6

submit, despite the analogy of patent law being closer to

7

copyright than civil rights cases, I think there are also

8

some unique considerations in copyright cases.

9

fact is that prior to 1976, the cases were all over the

10

board.

11

12

The simple

You couldn't say that there was certainly any dual

I would point out, the Senate report on the

13

Civil Rights Attorney's Fee Award Act in 1976, which we

14

cite in footnote 16 of our reply brief, the Senate report

15

goes on and recites the history of the '64 Civil Rights

16

Act, the Alyeska case, and then the dual standard, and

17

then it goes on to say that there are other statutes where

18

a similar dual standard has been interpreted by the

19

courts, and it cites the Water Pollution Control Act and

20

the Marine Protection Act as other places where there's a

21

dual standard.

22

It doesn't mention the Copyright Act, and that

23

was enacted the same year as the Copyright Act, so I don't

24

see how you can imply that Congress had in mind that there

the 1976 Copyright Act.
There is an argument that defendants have

sufficient incentives to litigate cases, and an example is

4

given that Fogerty defended this case.

5

that plaintiffs have a sufficient interest to litigate

cases whether they get preferential treatment in

Typically, plaintiffs in copyright cases are

trying to reap a substantial reward that the defendant is

12

Plaintiffs don't bother suing an unsuccessful writer, or

of gold, and you can make the same -- just turn the mirror
