ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. NAPIER MURPHY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. MURPHY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case involves a claim that section 2 of the

10
11

Voting Rights Act requires Bleckley County, Georgia, to

12

enlarge its current, single-member county commission to a

13

five-person commission.

14

Our position is that the act cannot be read as

15

authorizing Federal courts to alter the size of governing

16

bodies.

17

local governments, the number, and types of offices, must

18

be taken as a given, a basic assumption.

20

size of a government to prove a voting rights violation is

21

Instead, the existing structure of State and

member commission, you would say that, as in this case,

section 2 just doesn't cover it.
MR. MURPHY:

4

Your Honor, our position is not

that section 2 doesn't cover a claim.

6

that section 2 cannot be read as authorizing Federal

courts to change the size of the government.

Our argument is

The courts

11

county commission of five commissioners, and it was shrunk

12

to three, allegedly causing a dilution, would there be a

13

section 2 remedy for the court in that instance?

So that the overarching proposition

that section 2 does not apply to changes in the size of a

I put.

16

MR. MURPHY:

No, sir.

The county has not tried

17

to change the size of the local governing body here.

18

There has been a group of private plaintiffs who have

19

filed a lawsuit seeking to change the size of the local

20

governing body.

21

Our position is that the intent of Congress in

22

writing section 2 was not to guarantee election to office,

23

not to guarantee proportional representation, but simply

24

to question whether the existing size, or the existing

25

system dilutes minority -5

1

But I just want to make sure what

your proposition is.

3

outset that section 2 is not applicable to changes in the

4

size of governmental entities, and I put this hypothetical

5

designed to test that, and I'm still not sure of your

answer.
MR. MURPHY:

I thought that you'd stated at the

section 2 addresses the method of electing persons to
office.

If there were a change by the government from

10

five to three, and it could be proven that there was a

11

dilution of minority voting strength as a result of that,

12

then there would be a claim under section 2.

13

QUESTION:

All right, then the courts are, in

14

that instance, interfering with a governmental decision as

15

to what the size of the governing body ought to be.

That is because the governing body

MR. MURPHY:

No, sir, I don't agree with that.

22

I don't think an act of omission is the same as an act of

commission.

unit from which any elected person can -QUESTION:

Well, I grant you that, but if change

MR. MURPHY:

There's nothing magical about this
The question is --

Well, if there isn't, don't you lose?
No, sir.

The question here is

19

whether Congress intended, under section 2, to authorize

20

Federal courts to judge the governmental structure not as

21

it presently is constituted, but as it might be in a

22

hypothetical model, and if we have three, or five, or

electing to office, minority members could always come in

The distinction here is not that a

QUESTION:

1

Do you concede that it is essential

2

to make a legislative executive distinction in order to

3

support your position in this case?
MR. COATES:

4

Not for this particular case, but

5

in response to his question I was answering it in that

6

way.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Coates, you said, I thought, in

8

response to Justice Souter's question that you look all

9

around the country for a benchmark so that even if all of

10

the 250 or whatever it is counties they have in Georgia

11

all had single commissioners, you might find a benchmark

12

out in the State of Oregon, say, where perhaps they all

13

had -- the counties had five-member commissions?

14

MR. COATES:

No, sir.

I think that the first

15

place you would look to a benchmark would be to the State,

16

because that would determine the State's policy.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

So if you found all single

commissioners in Georgia, could you look any further?
MR. COATES:

I think that that would be a much

20

more difficult case, because if Georgia had a statute that

21

provided that every county would have a sole commissioner,

22

then there would be a strong argument in this case that

23

the State policy required the sole-commissioner form of

24

government, but I thought --

It wouldn't be conclusive?

MR. COATES:

It would not be

I think it would

2

be a much more difficult case.

3

counsel could construct an argument that would say that

4

you could look to Oregon, I just don't know, but in this

5

case 159 counties exist in Georgia.

commissioner form.

MR. COATES:

Whether or not some

Yes, sir.

There are only 11

MR. COATES:

QUESTION:

It's 11 -- the number's 11, not 14?
Yes, ma'am, I think it is.
The district court went with you, as

15

I understand it, the first two steps of the way.

16

the district court and the court of appeals divided was on

17

what has been called the second two Gingles factors.

18

Would you explain on what basis you think that your case

19

meets those second two requirements, the cohesiveness on

20

the part of the minority community and the bloc voting on

21

the part of the majority community?

22

MR. COATES:

Where

Well, the court of appeals held

23

that the analysis applied to the issue of racial bloc

24

voting by the district court judge was too narrow.

determination, that he was limited to statistical analysis

2

in determining the existence or nonexistence of racial

3

bloc voting.
The court of appeals held that you could look to

4
5

other, antidotal evidence in the case that addressed the

6

issue of racial polarization, such as the fact that when

7

black people go to vote in Bleckley County, that there

8

would be in an 8-year period 224 black -- white managers

9

and no black managers, for example.
The court of appeals said that one could look

QUESTION:

Well, you wouldn't have to look at

13

anything other than if you had a minority population that

would always be the case.

15

would be permissible.

There was no proof of any kind with respect to

17

the division of the votes at the time of the referendum

18

minority-majority votes for and against, was there?

19

MR. COATES:

That's correct, because in 1986,

20

the eight existing precincts that existed in 1984 had been

21

consolidated into one precinct, and under a one-precinct

22

situation regression analysis is not possible because you

23

need at least two or more precincts to compare to do the

24

regression analysis, so it was not a possibility for the

25

plaintiffs in this case to offer a statistical showing

concerning the 1986 referendum.

2

But the court of appeals pointed to footnote 25

3

of this Court's opinion in the Gingles case and read that

4

footnote to say that the district court was incorrect in

5

ruling that you looked at only statistical evidence, and

6

allowed a broader look, and on that basis came to the

7

conclusion that the district court had erred.

8

9

What is the broader look, other than that when
you have a unit that has a majority population and a

10

minority population, the chances are that you will have a

11

representative from the majority group?

12

MR. COATES:

The broader look was the continuing

13

racial segregation and polarization within the county

14

which created an impediment for black candidates to

15

solicit white voters, or for black voters to form

16

coalitions with white voters, and that continuing

17

polarization was evidence sufficient in addition to the

18

statistical evidence that the plaintiffs offered to

satisfy the racial polarization requirement in Gingles.

10-person commission?

2

MR. COATES:

No, sir.

First of all, our

3

position is that the increase in the number of

4

representatives on the governing authority would first be

5

determined by looking at the State law benchmark, and the

6

State law benchmark in this case I believe is 5, it would

7

not be 10.

8

9

Secondarily, this court held in 1972, in the
Beens case -- I think it's Sixty-seventh Minnesota v.

10

Beens -- that minor deviations are allowed from the State

11

choice concerning the number of representatives.

12

deviation from the State benchmark were more than minor,

13

then Beens would tend to teach that that alteration would

14

not be allowed.

15

QUESTION:

Well, let me put it this way.

If the

If

16

there were a benchmark that permitted a governing body of

a size which would give proportional representation to the

excluded race, then it is your position that they would

say -- the court of appeals did not say, in suggesting the
use of the five single-member district plan, that that was

done to effectuate proportional representation.

If I said there
I don't know what vote dilution

It's a meaningless term.

MR. COATES:

It's entirely relative,

Well, if I said that there wasn't

vote dilution under the single commissioner form in

Bleckley County, I did not intend to say that.

QUESTION:
there wouldn't be.

No, no, but you said in another State
If another State had all single-member

10

people, that wouldn't be vote dilution, even though the

11

votes would be diluted to the same degree, but that

12

wouldn't be "vote dilution" as you've been talking about,

13

isn't that right?

MR. COATES:

It would depend upon the particular

circumstances oi evidence in that particular jurisdiction.

Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. MURPHY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
We have a county of 10,000 people.

70 percent

of the registered voters, black and white, are registered.

Voter registration is equal for both blacks and whites.

In these other counties that went from one

to three -- one to three -- why didn't they go one to

five?

Because three guaranteed proportional

If five is the benchmark, these other

QUESTION:

Mr. Murphy, if we were to look at the

11

district court decision and go that far, reject your

12

argument as far as the district court did, what would your

13

argument be about what it would take to satisfy the

14

factors that the court of appeals found were not satisfied

15

in this case, the bloc voting and cohesiveness?

16

Let's say that you lose on your main argument,

17

and we're back in the district court, and the district

18

court says, in my view, this case fails for lack of proof

19

on those two items, what would be adequate proof?

20

MR. MURPHY:

Adequate proof of political

21

cohesion would be proof that minorities get together to

22

sponsor candidates, that they run a candidate.

23

No minority has ever run for any county-wide

office in the 81-year history with the exception of one
