ORAL ARGUMENT OF VIRGINIA L. LINDER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. LINDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case, like the one that precedes it, turns

11
12

on a question of statutory interpretation.

13

single statute.

14

certain state practices that Congress has decided

15

unreasonably burden and discriminate against the railroad

16

industry.

17

Oregon property tax system discriminates against them

18

because it exempts certain categories of property from its

19

general property tax system without giving the same

20

exemption to the property that they own.

21

It involves a

Section 11503 of the 4R Act prohibits

The plaintiffs in this case claim that the

The question here is whether Oregon's exemption

22

policies discriminate against railroads in any way that

23

Congress acted to prohibit.

24
25

QUESTION:

Now, Ms. Linder, we are concerned

here only with subsection (4), is that correct?

That's

1

the only issue before us, the meaning of that subsection

2

(4) ?
MS. LINDER:

3

Justice O'Connor, the precise

4

question is the meaning of subsection (4).

5

only subsection under which they proceeded.
QUESTION:

6

All right.

That is the

And it says that a state

7

may not impose another tax that discriminates against rail

8

carrier.
MS. LINDER:

9

QUESTION:

10

Yes, Your Honor.
All right, now, what other tax does

11

that mean?

12

other than an ad valorem property tax?
MS. LINDER:

13
14

I mean, what's the meaning of that?

QUESTION:

MS. LINDER:

QUESTION:

MS. LINDER:

QUESTION:

21

MS. LINDER:

23

That's how you read it?
Yes.
So it would cover sales taxes and

gross receipts taxes and income taxes?

19

22

Our position is that's exactly what

it means.

15

18

Is that

That, the question of -Yes?

Under your theory.

Your Honor, that's an open

question.
QUESTION:

Well, why wouldn't it?

I mean, if it

24

means any other tax other than ad valorem, why doesn't it

25

pick up all those other taxes?

QUESTION:

Taken as a matter of

But you agree that the plain language

would suggest it would cover all these other taxes?
MS. LINDER:

As a matter of pure plain language,

sitting along in that section, yes, Your Honor, we would

10

agree with that.

11

the statute as a whole, what you end up with with the any

12

other tax that discriminates are five words in the context

13

of a statute that is otherwise wholly dedicated to the

14

proposition or to tests on ad valorem property taxes.

15

When you look at it in the context of

QUESTION:

Well, but there was certainly some

16

indication in the legislative history that gross receipts

17

taxes and so forth were in the minds of the drafters of

18

that provision.

19

MS. LINDER:

And we believe that's exactly what

20

that provision was intended to reach.

21

would reach a gross receipts tax.

QUESTION:

We agree that it

reach sales and income and other taxes.
MS. LINDER:

The language would seem to sweep

more broadly in the provision itself.

QUESTION:

Well, if it did then how do you view
No exemptions allowed for these other

I believe that's our opponent's
It is certainly not ours.
But if it doesn't reach that far, if

7

the and other language is qualified, and if it's qualified

8

in terms of the statute, then doesn't that mean that it's

9

plausible that another tax means a property tax that is

10

equalized so far as assessment and rate but has

11

differential exemptions?

12

the point of the question was the minute you say that

13

another tax is more narrow than the language would suggest

14

and it's qualified by the rest of the act, it seems to me

15

that that is consistent with the proposal of the railroads

16

in this case.

17

MS. LINDER:

The minute you say another --

Justice Kennedy, if I understand

18

the point of the question correctly, I think my answer is

19

that if we were looking at some other tax on property,

20

other than a generally applicable ad valorem property tax,

21

that was reached under subsection (b)(4), you might, the

22

question then would be other exemptions from that tax, I

23

would think, and what Congress would mean in terms of

24

exemptions from that same tax.

25

create license to go back up and revisit the judgment that

I don't think that would

1

was made in the first three subsections of the act about

2

exempt property.

3

Our basic view of the statute is this.

It is a

4

statutory hole.

5

statute are addressed to a generally applicable ad valorem

6

property tax system, and what you get if you want to sue a

7

state for its application of that tax to your property, is

8

you get what those first three sections provide for.

9

Subsection (b)(4) does not go back up and revisit the

The first three subsections of the

10

grounds on which you may sue the state.

provides exactly what, it means what it says.

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. LINDER:

14

QUESTION:

Subsection (4)
You can --

That's because it says another tax.
That's right.
But then why do you shy away from the

15

logical, what seems to me logical definition of another

16

tax in your response to Justice O'Connor's question, which

17

was some other tax other than an ad valorem property tax?

18

MS. LINDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't mean to

19

shy away from that at all.

20

The question may be, and it's not a question you need to

21

answer in this case we don't believe, how much broader it

22

is, how far beyond an ad valorem property tax it goes.

23

For instance, would it extend to a corporate income tax?

24

That question has never been answered and lower courts

25

have divided somewhat on those things.

We think it does mean that.

QUESTION:

1

And you say we don't have to answer

2

it here because what you're talking about is an ad valorem

3

property tax?

4

MS. LINDER:

Precisely.

The tax that Oregon

5

levies on the railroad cars in this case is a tax derived

6

from our general ad valorem property tax system that

7

applies to everyone.

8

tested it needs to be tested under subsections (1) through

9

(3).

10
11

And for that reason, if it is to be

It is not a tax that can be tested under subsection

(b) (4) .
QUESTION:

Ms. Linder, you use the word general

12

ad valorem property tax.

13

word general?

14

MS. LINDER:

15

QUESTION:

Does the statute contain the

It does not.
What would the situation be in your

16

view if all other taxpayers in the state paid a gross

17

receipts tax, an income tax, a sales tax, several taxes,

18

but none of them paid an ad valorem tax except the

19

railroads, so it was a special ad valorem tax?

20

violate the statute or not?

21

MS. LINDER:

Would that

Justice Stevens, my first answer to

22

it is you could test it under subsection (b)(4).

Whether

23

it would violate the statute is a far more difficult

24

question, but we would agree you may challenge that under

25

subsection (b)(4).

The difficulty is for purposes of that

section we have absolutely no test to apply -QUESTION:

There would be no discrimination

because everybody who is assessed an ad valorem tax would

pay at the same rate and the same amount.

would pay the same tax.

MS. LINDER:

QUESTION:

All railroads

But at that point -But you don't know whether you think

that would violate the statute or not?
MS. LINDER:

I do not know whether it is a

10

discriminatory tax at that point.

11

not an ad valorem property tax in the sense that Congress

12

intended it.

13

QUESTION:

I believe that it is

You think Congress intended to

14

include the word general even though it doesn't appear in

15

the statute?

16

MS. LINDER:

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes.

But you say that that hypothetical

18

tax would not violate subsections (1) through (3) because

19

of the definition that allows exemptions?

20

MS. LINDER:

Justice O'Connor, that hypothetical

21

tax simply doesn't fit the model contained in subsections

22

(1) through (3).

23

granted one that does not have the word general in it, is,

we think the basic understanding there is a broad,

generally applied tax that extends to real and personal

1

property with a host of taxpayers in that group,

2

that's certainly consistent with the history if it's

3

necessary to resort to that to see what Congress was

4

thinking about when it used the terms.

5

and

It's also very much the kind of property tax

6

that is contained within the structure and the model that

7

is devised by virtue of the assumption that we are going

8

to test the rates and the assessments that are levied on

9

railroad property against some other group of comparisons

10

and seek an average.

property?

yes.
QUESTION:

And is it typical that these schemes

have exemptions?
MS. LINDER:

Justice O'Connor,

I know of no

state that does not.
Under our approach in that case what the

21

carlines must do is they must bring their challenge under

22

subsections

brought there then the immediate result is that they have

24

no cause of action.

argument that under your view you couldn't have property B

2

taxed at a lower rate than railroad property, that would

3

be barred, but you could have a total exemption of

4

property B, and that would be okay?

5

the statute I take it that that would follow, that you

6

couldn't tax property B a little less, but the state could

7

exempt it altogether.

8

MS. LINDER:

9

Under your reading of

Justice Ginsburg, that is exactly

our reading of the statute.

Our view of what Congress

10

both said and did and intended is that this was

11

essentially an equalization formula for railroad property.

12

Congress intended railroad property to get the benefit of

13

the average taxed property in the jurisdiction.

14

It is a very different proposition, states raise

15

and lower taxes on different taxpayers and different items

16

of property, as does the Federal Government, for a host of

17

reasons, drawing distinctions between types of property

18

and owners.

19

dealing with a very powerful policy choice on a

20

government's part that suggests that perhaps a very

21

different policy is at work, and that is exactly the kind

22

of policy choice that drove the wording of the comparison

23

class and caused it to be limited to property subject to a

24

property tax levy.

25

But when governments exempt you are usually

So it is not the illogical result in any sense

to say that if we want to equalize railroad property and
insure that they are not taxed higher than some average,
we will look to some comparison that consists of taxed
property.

Typically in equalization formulas, which were

expressly contemplated as Congress crafted the act, you do
not look to exempt property to equalize because as a
policy matter something different is going on when states
take the property out of its tax base altogether.
QUESTION:

And you say that's reflected in

11503(a)(4) which defines property to be only property
that is subject to a property tax?
MS. LINDER:

Justice Scalia, yes.

believe that's exactly what it means.

That, we

directly on that issue.

examined it has so concluded, and we think for sound
policy reasons or sound text-based reasons.

You said that every state has some

Tell me, what is the pattern so far as
Do most states have different

classifications of property so far as both assessment and
rate, or is that unusual?
MS. LINDER:

Justice Kennedy, my understanding

is that the more common model is that there is not a broad
classification system in most states.

There are some

1

States, I believe I have heard of one that has as many as

2

21 different classes of property, but my understanding is

3

that the common model in the states is to have a fairly

4

uniform system between real and personal property alike.

5

If we are correct that subsection (b)(4) has no

6

application to a general, to the levy of a generally

7

applicable property tax, and certainly even if there is

8

some application that you can bring for purposes of

9

subsection (b)(4), it should not be used to test a state's

10

exemption policies because those were expressly

11

contemplated in the first three sections and Congress

12

adopted an unqualified position on that matter.

13

think this case is emend.

14

not state a claim under the statute.

15

Then we

At that point the carlines do

There are other questions if we're wrong

16

concerning the remedy that would, the test that you would

17

apply and the remedy that you would attach, and those

18

questions become increasingly difficult once you begin to

19

try to take subsection (b)(4), which was not at all

20

tailored to the kind of challenge that they bring, and

21

determine how it is you would even challenge the very

22

thing that Congress contemplated in the first three

23

subsections.

24
25

The difficult with coming up with a test is
another reason that we think it demonstrates that neither

1

the language nor the structure nor anything Congress

2

intended, expected that we would be in subsection (b)(4).

3

QUESTION:

Ms. Linder, what is your view of the

4

district court, the district court held for Oregon but it

5

recognized the possibility of de facto discrimination,

6

which I took to mean if it turned out that they were

7

really exempting everything except railroad property?

8

9
10
11

MS. LINDER:

That is, Justice Ginsburg, that is

what the district court assumed was one of the possible
things it might have to test for under subsection (b)(4).
QUESTION:

But I take it that your reading of

12

subsection (b)(4) wouldn't even leave room for that

13

because you say it just has no office with respect to this

14

very same tax.

15

MS. LINDER:

That is correct to a point.

That

16

is our reading, and I have to say to a point.

17

clearly to be a point at which if you carve away

18

everything out of your tax system except the thing that

19

looks like a railroad, at that point you do not have the

20

broadly applicable tax system that Congress envisioned.

21

The problem with both what the district court

22

then examined, it found no violation even if it were to

23

use that kind of an inquiry, but the problem with the way

24

the examination gets made, and it's the problem with the

25

way the carlines want to make it in this case with their

There seems

1

persistent use of the number 67 percent of exempt

2

property, the point of talking about those kinds of

3

percentages is to suggest that the state is moving towards

4

a system that is no longer broadly applicable.

5

If you're going to test for that, you do not

look at the kinds of numbers certainly that the carlines

have used in this case.

point it will not, no longer be the general system that

18

Congress had in mind?

19

what Congress -- you come to us with a textual argument

20

and your textual argument is simply that by reason of

21

1105(a)(4) it is, you have simply not, there is no rate

22

applicable to commercial and industrial property that is

23

not taxed, and therefore you can't possibly be

24

discriminating against that property.

I know it's a feel good limitation, we all

But I don't see how you get to some

I do get it out of the text, but I

want to emphasize that we are talking about something so

10

different than what we were talking about in Oregon, that

11

it wouldn't look anything like what Oregon is.
QUESTION:

12

Let's concede that, but how do you

13

get it out of the text?

14

I exempt everything except railroads, an ad valorem

15

16

Don't you have to say under your theory of the statute

that that's okay, if the state wants to be that nutty and

collect no other money?

through (3), the very expectation of the language of those

sections and the model that is created in them is that you

3

are dealing with a property tax system that includes on

4

some basis multiple property tax owners and multiple kinds

of property.

that's exactly what Congress intended, and if you have a

MS. LINDER:

There are two.

The first is in the

comparison class itself which refers to real or personal

property and doesn't suggest that you have to draw a line

between them and not put them both together.

5

There is another base as well.

If you look to

subsection (c) which refers to the assessment methodology

7

that a state would use, there is a potential for the

8

assessment method to not have a sufficient number of

9

properties in the comparison so that you, if the district

court is dissatisfied that it is a reasonable sample of

11

properties from the comparison class, the district court

12

may then pull a new sample from the entire property tax

MR. PHILLIPS:

Not as the case comes to this

Court at this particular point.
In our view Oregon unquestionably treats the

4

railroad property worse than it treats the majority of the

5

other property within the state, and accordingly

6

respondents urge the Court to hold that Oregon imposes a

7

tax that results in discriminatory treatment against rail

8

carriers as that language appeared in the original version

9

of what is now 49 U.S.C. section 11503(b)(4), and

10
11

therefore the tax is unlawful.
In turn respondents urge the Court to hold that

12

the only appropriate remedy for that situation is to

13

enjoin the state from imposing that personal property tax

14

and thereby treat the railroad property just as it treats

15

the majority of other property within the state.

16

In doing that there are essentially three issues

17

in this case, although at this stage you might have lost

18

sight of a couple of them because the state for its part

19

focuses almost exclusively on the threshold question of

20

whether or not (b)(4) applies to anything at all, almost

in some respects, but certainly it raises the question of

Why did you say that was so in the

MR. PHILLIPS:

Because that is what Congress

13

change the substantive sweep of any of the language

Mr. Phillips, why isn't the most

16

natural reading of that language to refer to any tax other

17

than an ad valorem property tax?

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think the most natural reading

19

of that language is to refer to any other tax that

20

discriminates.

or means of discrimination in the first two provisions,

22

and the language at the end both deals with additional

23

discriminations and also deals more broadly than the

They deal much

more broadly with the question of discriminatory treatment

MR. PHILLIPS:

It is using that

I would have understood the way

7

you argued that, Justice Souter, for exactly the opposite

proposition, which is that it clearly must mean that the

9

state is not in a position where it can sit back and

10

exempt all of the other property of the state, leaving

11

only the railroads out there exposed to discrimination,

12

and find a way to argue that that's nevertheless not a

treatment that results in discrimination against the

14

railroads.

15

QUESTION:

Well, that's not the point.

you clearly could so argue and you would probably have a

very good policy ground for so arguing, but I don't see

that as being the easiest way to read this text.

2

defeating.

3

QUESTION:

Is it so odd when you start with the

4

proposition that the statute is to begin with an exception

5

to the Tax Injunction Act?

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it's interesting in that

7

regard because the states historically have now taken

8

diametrically opposed views of what this language means

9

precisely.

On the one hand when they have non-ad valorem

10

taxes they tell you that it only applies to ad valorem

11

taxes, and when they have ad valorem taxes they tell you

12

it applies to every other tax except ad valorem taxes.

13

And presumably if you were interpreting this with

14

reference to the canon of construction under the Anti-

15

Injunction Act, both of those positions would be equally

16

supported in exactly the same way.

17

It seems to me the language is not so very plain

18

on either side that you can tell what Congress precisely

19

meant, but what you can tell is what Congress' objective

20

was here which was to avoid allowing railroads to be

21

treated more harshly than the majority of other property

22

within the state.

23

adopt a view that guarantees that the state, excuse me,

24

that the railroads will have majority support, then it

25

seems to me the only way you can do that is to find that

QUESTION:

Do you agree with that?

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, no, I have some difficulty

11

with that, Justice Souter, because every court of appeals

12

that has addressed this issue, has read that language, has

13

inferred from that language that it is a catch-all

14

provision and that it really means any additional taxes

15

that discrimination over and above the ones that are

16

objectively identified in (b)(1) through (b)(3).

17

find it at least presumptuous of me to suggest that that's

18

not a very natural and reasonable interpretation of that

language because there are a whole host of very talented

jurists who have reached that exact conclusion, indeed all

of them have.

that exemption of more than 50 percent of the personal

And once the state

exempts more than 50 percent of other business' personal

you have discrimination that is per se invalid under

property be taxed at the lower rate, or whatever the
majority rate is.

It could be favorable or unfavorable,

but that 50 percent majority line is inherent in (b)(3)

And therefore that language doesn't necessarily

take you back up to the discrimination language of the
preamble, and it ought to be given the full effect.
QUESTION:

The carrier language doesn't, but the

discrimination language still may.
MR. PHILLIPS:

The difficulty I have with your

argument, Justice Souter, is you still are dealing -- I
don't see how you get to the point where you say I can
take all of the property of the state out of the personal
property tax base except the railroads, and that's not a
tax that results in discrimination against the railroads,
against the rail carriers.
QUESTION:

It depends on whether you're going to

redefine the word discrimination or not.

Your argument

assumes that discriminate in (d) means something other
than the discrimination exemplified in (a) through (c).
If you don't make that assumption, if you say based on the
text I am going to assume that discriminate has a common
usage throughout this section, then in fact it is no
objection to the argument to say that yes, you may indeed
leave the railroad as the only taxpayer with respect to a
certain class of property.

the answer.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

I have two thoughts about that.

4

First of all, the use of the term discriminate in the

5

preamble talks about discriminating against interstate

6

commerce, whereas the term discriminate in subsection

7

(b)(4) talks about discrimination against rail carriers.

8

So I'm not sure that it's fair to infer that those

necessarily reincorporate each other, and it's an odd

10

phraseology.

11

through (b)(3) and too narrow constrain them, what you do

is violence to the language differences between (b)(1) and

Now, assuming that the (b)(4) exemption applies

to the particular taxes here and that the exemption scheme

because what you've done is you have created three
