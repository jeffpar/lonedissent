ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. CARTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Kenneth Nichols, the petitioner in this case,

12

was convicted in 1990 in the Eastern District of Tennessee

13

with conspiracy to distribute cocaine.

14

under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.

15

presentence report was prepared, his prior criminal

16

history indicated that he was to receive three points for

17

a 1983 conviction that was late in 1983, in December, for

18

a drug-related offense.

19

He was sentenced
When the

In additional to that criminal history point, he

20

received one criminal history point for an uncounseled

21

prior misdemeanor conviction for DUI.

22

DUI sentence a sentence of a $250 fine, DUI school, and no

23

term of imprisonment.

24

imprisonment of up to 11 months and 29 days in jail.

He received in that

He faced in that case a term of

presented to the court and on which the district court

2

relied, indicated that there was no information available

3

from the court record in Georgia whether the defendant was

4

represented by an attorney.

5

Nichols, also told the presentence officer that he had

6

gone to see some lawyer.

7

you're just going to plead nolo contendere in that Georgia

8

misdemeanor case, you don't need a lawyer.

9

The defendant, or petitioner

The lawyer told him that if

The district judge found, as a matter of fact,

10

that there was no counsel at the 1983 DUI conviction,

11

noting that there was no evidence to the contrary other

12

than the testimony of Mr. Nichols.

13

that there was no counsel.

14

found on the basis of the evidence in the record, that is

15

the presentence report, that there was no valid waiver of

16

counsel shown on the Georgia DUI conviction.

17

of his experience with -- dealing with the presentence

18

officers and his confidence in him he, as a matter of

19

fact, found that this was an uncounseled DUI conviction

20

for which --

QUESTION:

It was not contested

The district judge further

On the basis

Well, assuming that is so, for the

22

original DWI conviction there was no jail sentence

imposed, right?

24

MR. CARTER:

25

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.
So that that sentence, under our

holding in the Scott case, is not unconstitutional.

MR. CARTER:

QUESTION:

That is -The conviction and sentence for the

DWI are not unconstitutional, right?
MR. CARTER:

Under the holding of Scott, Your

6

Honor, that DUI conviction was not unconstitutional at the

7

time it was imposed - -

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. CARTER:

Right, and you accept that.
And I accept that, but for the

10

limited reason that there was no fine, or rather no term

11

of imprisonment or incarceration.

12

QUESTION:

Now, I suppose that at most

13

sentencings it is possible for the sentencing authority to

14

consider even prior acts for which there is not even a

15

conviction in terms of determining a sentence?

16

MR. CARTER:

Your Honor, it is true that under

17

the Guidelines a judge is entitled --a district judge is

18

entitled and required to consider, to hear, and to weigh

19

such evidence to determine what impact it should have.

20

The thing that I believe is - -

21
22

23

QUESTION:

I mean, what makes this particular

prior conviction less reliable than that kind of evidence?
MR. CARTER:

Your Honor, I believe that the

24

thing that makes this conviction more unreliable -- it's

25

really not a question of making it quite more unreliable,

Well, but now it's not

It isn't initially.
There's nothing unlawful about it.
No, Your Honor, not initially for

the limited purpose of giving him a money fine.
QUESTION:

Well, you say -- you talk as though

10

there's some sort of a springing use concept, that the

11

conviction wasn't unconstitutional initially.

12

suggesting that it later becomes unconstitutional?

13

MR. CARTER:

I am, Your Honor.

Are you

And I recognize

14

that this Court in the dissent in Baldasar was concerned

15

that this was creating or might create or does create, and

16

I think it does, a hybrid conviction that might be valid

17

for some purposes and yet invalid for another.

18

what I want to try to convince the Court is - - is that

19

there is a very good reason, based on the Sixth Amendment

20

of the United States, why that is a very good and

21

appropriate rule.

And today

22

And not only a good and appropriate rule, but a

23

rule that will be easy for our Federal district courts to

24

apply, that will give the weight and deference the Sixth

25

Amendment deserves and yet not upset our system of law,

which I understand this Court is very concerned with, the

2

effect of holding that a conviction might be valid for one

purpose and not for another.

QUESTION:

Let me say --

May I just ask you those purposes for

no quarrel with that.

MR. CARTER:

QUESTION:

That's right, just criminal status,

he's got a record.

MR. CARTER:

So long as there is no term of

imprisonment, yes, Your Honor.

It's valid in giving the

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.

And it's valid for purposes of a

fine.

15

MR. CARTER:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
A substantial one.

It's valid, I

17

assume, a conviction like this, for purposes of license

18

revocation or declarations of ineligibility to drive?

19

MR. CARTER:

20

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Why isn't it valid -- why shouldn't

21

it be valid, why isn't it reliable enough to be used to

22

identify a class of individuals who are going to be

23

subject to a heavier penalty in the future?

24

Government's argument is that the use -- that the direct

25

use that's being made of the conviction is simply to

Because the

identify the class which is subject to a more onerous

sentencing scheme for later offenses.

unreliable for that purpose?

4

MR. CARTER:

Why is it

I think the reason why it is un --

it is improper is because of its unreliability.

history of - -

QUESTION:

The

Well, but where -- where -- where

does the relative unreliability -- how do you draw the
line on relative unreliability?

If it's reliable enough

10

to identify him as a criminal with certain consequences

11

short of incarceration, why is it unreliable enough to

12

identify him as a member of a class which is on notice

13

that the class members face a heavier penalty scheme if

14

they commit further offenses?

15

MR. CARTER:

Well, frankly, Your Honor, I think

16

that the distinction is -- is that of incarceration.

17

think they're all unreliable, I think we're just willing

18

to accept the unreliable -- unreliability in some

1

circumstances.

Here - -

QUESTION:

Well, would your answer -- would your

21

answer be different if the individual had an opportunity

22

before he was sentenced, as giving -- giving weight to the

23

first conviction, to prove that, in fact, he didn't do

24

what, on the record, he appears to have been convicted of?

25

Would your answer be different if he had that opportunity?

1

MR. CARTER:

Your Honor, if the judge had a

2

weighing and sentencing -- in the sentencing determination

3

was able to himself weigh something then yes, I think an

4

argument could be made that even though it's initially

5

unreliable, that the judge, since he has some discretion,

6

could decide how much weight to give.

7

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't -- doesn't the judge

8

have that discretion under the Guidelines, because he can

9

depart downward if the criminal -- if he is satisfied that

10

the criminal history does not give an adequate or accurate

11

indication of the --of the individual's past culpability?

12

MR. CARTER:

I think it is true that under the

13

Sentencing Guidelines the judge does -- if he finds a

14

reason which he articulates and which will stand on

15

appeal, that he can depart.

16

automatic --

17

QUESTION:

However, there is an

Well, you could -- you could give him

18

that reason, couldn't you, if you said, look, this was an

19

unreliable conviction because, in fact, I didn't do it?

20

MR. CARTER:

21

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor -And I'll -- I'll bring in a couple of

22

witnesses to show that I didn't.

23

the -- has the option to hear that evidence and to

24

consider that request, doesn't he?

25

MR. CARTER:

Now, the judge has

1

an option to determine what sentencing range it is within

2

which he is to be sentenced.

3

was an automatic increase from range two to range three

4

because of this one criminal history point, and that meant

5

Nichols was sentenced at the very top of category three

criminal history score for his offense.

7

months - QUESTION:

8

9

He automatically -- there

He got 25

Yeah, but the judge -- the judge can

then -- if the judge is satisfied that the -- that the

10

criminal history is not sufficient -- is not adequately

11

revealing of the facts, he can then depart downwards so

12

that a person in your client's position would come out the

13

same way as if it hadn't been considered in the first

14

place.

15
16
17

Isn't that correct?
MR. CARTER:

Only if there is an adequate

justification for that.
QUESTION:

Well, that's right.

And if there is

18

an adequate justification, the judge can do it.

19

isn't an adequate justification, there's no indication

20

that the original sentence is or the original conviction

21

is unreliable.

22

MR. CARTER:

If there

Well, I think it is true there can

23

be a downward departure.

I do think that there is a very

24

basic reason why these kinds of convictions are

25

unreliable, and I'd like to speak to it, if I could.

QUESTION:

1

But you --do you agree with me that

2

there is an opportunity to show the unreliability, and if

3

that unreliability is shown the judge has an opportunity

4

to consider that in a downward departure?

5

MR. CARTER:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. CARTER:

8

Yes, Your Honor, I do.
Okay.
Subject to, of course, being

reversed if he gave undue deference or weight to it.

But

I think that the important distinction in this case is
10

that the Sentencing Guidelines have brought a new

11

dimension to sentencing.

12

there is no discretion, and one of them is the Guideline

13

range.

14

when there is --

15

this prior uncounseled misdemeanor.

There are certain things where

The Guideline range does automatically increase
when there is the use, for instance, of

16

Now, why should the court be concerned about an

17

uncounseled misdemeanor where there is only a money fine?

18

The reason for that is, I think, found in the history of

1

Gideon v. Wainwright, Argersinger, where the Court found

20

first that, from its previous decisions, the right to

21

counsel is very important.

22

court is not able to follow all the rules of the court, is

23

not able to understand the processes of the court.

24
25

Even an educated person in a

Now, what happened was after Argersinger, the
Scott v. Illinois decision gave the line, the clear line

1

that if incarceration was involved, then the conviction

2

was unconstitutional if there was no counsel.

3

was incarceration, there simply had to be counsel.

If there

Now, that court -- in my view, the case

4
5

recognizes the fact that an uncounseled misdemeanor is

6

inherently unreliable.

7

where -- in the county where I practice, and I think all

8

over the country, the lower courts, the sessions courts,

Day in and day out in the counties

the municipal courts, hear thousands and thousands of
10

cases.

They have crowded dockets.

11

their cases along.

They're trying to move

12

What's happened with Scott v. Illinois is that

13

we have created a type of case where an individual faced

14

with an offense is likely to opt not to pay for a lawyer,

15

if they're able to hire one, because of the expense of

16

doing so, because all they've got to do to avoid this

17

problem is to enter a plea of guilty.

18
1
20

The initial conviction is constitutional.

There

aren't any rights waived.
QUESTION:

Well, they've have a right -- would

21

they have a right to appointed counsel if they chose to

22

contest the thing across the board and not simply agree to

23

pay a fine?

24
25

MR. CARTER:

If they were indigent, they would

have the right to find appointed counsel.

But even then,

1

Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that there are

2

people, because they fear the process, because they find

3

that there's an easy way to resolve this case just by

4

paying a little fine, will be lulled into believing that

5

there's no significance to it.

6

They won't have been read their rights, they

7

won't have been made to understand that what they're doing

8

is something significant.

9

think appears here is that we will be allowing, if we

Now, the grave danger that I

10

accept that once it's unconstitutional -- I mean rather

11

once it's constitutional because there's only a money

12

fine, if we do not say that it later becomes

13

unconstitutional if we're trying to impose incarceration,

14

is that we will be relying upon thousands of convictions

15

which are inherently unreliable because of the reality of

16

life out there in the court system.

17

QUESTION:

Well, you say they're unreliable and

18

therefore that the person not only chose to pay the fine,

19

but chose to pay the fine when he could have defended --

20

successfully defended the action?

21
22

23
24
25

MR. CARTER:

That's right, Your Honor, and that

can happen.
QUESTION:

Well, what reason do you have for

thinking that?
MR. CARTER:

Well, Your Honor, experience.

QUESTION:

in people in juvenile courts -Well, but anything -- anything other

than your own personal experience?
MR. CARTER:

4

Well, Your Honor, I think my

5

personal experience and I think the Court's decisions that

6

have -- in Gideon, in Argersinger, and in Scott that have

7

noted that the process -- we're all human with all of our

8

frailties in the system.

9

and we're always trying to make it as reliable as

We have to run it with humans,

10

possible.

11

enhanced reliability is needed if we're going to impose

imprisonment on someone.

things that the Court - -

Gideon and Argersinger and Scott was reliability?

1

essentially the key to why we want to have counsel, is

2

that counsel makes the system more reliable by making

3

certain that the accused is aware of the significance of

4

what they're doing.

5

QUESTION:

Suppose that the accused was advised

6

that one of the consequences of the conviction that could

7

be entered if he proceeded without counsel and entered a

8

plea of nolo contendere, was that the sentence could later
be escalated based on a previous conviction?

QUESTION:

16

If Your Honor -Would that resolve your problem?
Your Honor, I believe it would
And what I'm trying to do -Would that make the conviction more

reliable?
MR. CARTER:

If there is a facially valid waiver

17

of counsel indicating on the face of the document that the

18

rights were read, that the defendant waived the right,

1

then I think that that does enhance the reliability of the

20

conviction, yes.

QUESTION:

Why does it enhance reliability as

opposed simply to making it fair to stick the defendant

with the conviction?

hear
QUESTION:

2

I mean if -- you're saying that the

3

waiver of counsel makes the conviction without counsel

4

more reliable, and my question is why does it make it more

reliable as opposed merely to making it more fair to

6

charge him with it, reliable or not?
MR. CARTER:

7

Well,

it makes it more reliable --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. CARTER:

10

Isn't the only difference --- Because at least we know that

11

what has been explained to the man is that - - or the woman

12

who faced the lower court,

13

explain that they did have a right to a trial, that they

14

did have a right to confront the witnesses.

15

those things where we are - -

16

QUESTION:

that the judge took the time to

It's one of

No, but -- that goes to waiver, but

17

why does it make the resulting uncounseled conviction more

18

reliable as to -- I assume as to the facts which it

19

imports?
MR. CARTER:

20

Well,

I suppose the answer to that

21

is perhaps it doesn't, but because there was still no

22

counsel.

23

right, the Supreme Court has,

24

instance, to defend themselves.

25

once the individual - - it has been explained to the

individual that they have that right, if they chose to do

2

it then they have the right to do it.

3

And I suppose in that case Your Honor is

4

probably correct, that that is --since there's no counsel,

perhaps it isn't unreliable in a factual sense.

you're saying is what is needed here is something

the possible consequences?

That's correct, Your Honor.

What

I'm trying to do is espouse or advance a rule that will

determines there was no term of imprisonment given, that

And so what we're saying is that what we're

offering as a court system is to make it reliable.

you, a defendant, ultimately, after being advised of your

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BRYSON:

10
11

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Our position in this case is that a valid

12

uncounseled misdemeanor conviction can be used for

13

sentence enhancement even if it could not support a

14

sentence of imprisonment in its own right.

15

this contention on three positions.

16

And we base

First, a particular factor does not need to be

17

sufficient to support a criminal conviction and

18

imprisonment in order to be used at sentencing.

1

there is nothing so inherently unreliable about a valid

uncounseled misdemeanor conviction that would bar its use

in a later sentencing proceeding.

1

person has a criminal record.
Now, let me address each of these three points

2

3

in more detail.

First, it's a well-settled principle of

4

sentencing law that this Court has reiterated again and

5

again, that the Court in sentencing may consider a very

6

broad range of factors.

7

would not have supported, in itself, a sentence of

8

imprisonment, doesn't mean it can't be used at sentencing.

9

And this - QUESTION:

10

Just because a particular factor

Mr. Bryson, isn't there a difference

11

between using a factor at sentencing when the judge has

12

broad discretion, on the one hand, and having an automatic

13

enhancement by adding to the criminal history score and

14

making him -- perhaps making him eligible for imprisonment

15

for the first time?
MR. BRYSON:

16

Your Honor, constitutionally I

17

don't think it makes a difference.

And for this reason,

18

because it -- suppose a judge were to say I would have let

19

you -- I would have given you probation, but I see that

20

you have this on your record and therefore I'm going to

21

give you 2 years; that's a discretionary call by the

22

judge.

23

guidelines system or some other system of guided

24

discretion that tells the judge that for a first offense

25

you should give an extra 2 years.

It's exactly the same, we submit, as having a

QUESTION:

1

Yes, but you have to acknowledge that

2

here there's a difference that if you didn't have the

3

automatic addition of the point and the judge took

4

evidence and found that there was this bad conduct

5

committed in the form of a misdemeanor, whether a valid

6

conviction or not, he would have discretion as to whether

7

to enhance or not, but under the Guidelines he doesn't.
MR. BRYSON:

8

9
10

Well, he doesn't have discretion

under the Guidelines to do that, that's true.

But as this

Court said in Dunnigan - QUESTION:

11

And most of your cases where you talk

12

about using prior history have been in the discretionary

13

context.

14

MR. BRYSON:

Yes.

But, Your Honor, this is

15

precisely the point that the Court addressed in the

16

Dunnigan opinion, in which it said there can't be a

17

difference between a decision that's made within the

18

discretionary system and a decision that is made as a

19

result of a guided discretion direction to take a

20

particular factor into account.

was required by the Guidelines.

character, if the defendant came in and offered evidence

to the effect that this history of his conviction was not

in the downward departure, couldn't he?
MR. BRYSON:

8

9

The judge could take that into consideration

Your Honor, I'm doubtful that the

Guidelines' provision for departure, which is section

10

4A1.3, was designed to permit a hearing in every case over

11

whether the particular prior convictions were in fact

12

convictions that result -- that --

MR. BRYSON:

The Guidelines range is 25 months,

so the judge -- if the one impermissible misdemeanor

conviction throws you up by 25 months it's exactly the

same outcome that occurred here by changing the criminal

12

that ground.

QUESTION:

Just to make sure I understand your

answer to Justice Stevens, is it your position that it

attempt to introduce evidence of the underlying fact?

MR. BRYSON:

No, Your Honor.

It is -- the

answer is that it would be improper to introduce the

conviction if the conviction could result in an

But it would

So that's

Now, to go back to the points that I think

1

2

really point the way here for how an uncounseled by valid

3

misdemeanor conviction should be regarded, it is something

4

that this Court has said in a number of different

5

contexts, that there are a variety of considerations for

6

sentencing that are perfectly inbounds to be considered

7

and that can result in enhancement of sentence, even

8

though they could not possibly have supported a term of

9

imprisonment, or for that matter even a criminal

10

conviction, standing by themselves.
In this Court's own cases, in cases such as the

11
12

Williams case involving uncharged conduct, cases involving

13

the failure to cooperate with the authorities, cases

14

involving perjury that is found by a judge by a

15

preponderance of the evidence, and cases involving say the

16

use of a weapon during the course of the commission of a

17

felony, all -QUESTION:

1

with the particular conduct that's at issue in the case on

2

trial, so the answer would be in some cases yes, in other

3

cases no.

4

And we think it makes no difference, because

5

what we're looking here at constitutionally is the

6

authority of a judge to make a determination not only with

7

respect to the kind of offense, all the circumstances of

8

the offense, but the kind of person the judge has before

9

him.

And the -- that person may be someone who his a

10

first-time offender and therefore the kind of person that

11

we typically extend leniency to, or that person may be a

12

person who has been convicted on other occasions and as to

13

whom we don't extend leniency.

14

QUESTION:

But isn't there a difference between

related conduct -- conduct related to the offense that the

judge must take into account and that can throw you into a

Well, the theory, Your Honor, is

4

that you can't use it in a civil proceeding.

6

Georgia in these kinds of cases is because it can't be

7

used to revoke your driver's license, which is often a

matter of great concern.

in Georgia law that as liberal as Georgia is in granting

And, in

But there -- it is quite clear

10

relief to someone who has pled nolo contendere, the -- it

11

does not give them protection against the use for

Now, let me turn next to the reliability point.

13
14

We submit that there is nothing that is so unreliable

15

about a valid misdemeanor conviction that makes it

16

unusable at a sentencing proceeding.
QUESTION:

17

But, Mr. Bryson, what about the fair

18

notice consideration, the Rule 11 question, where judges

19

are cautioned to be meticulous when they take a plea that

20

the defendant is fully informed of consequences of that

21

plea?

22

And this is a pretty important consequence.
MR. BRYSON:

Your Honor, it is my understanding

that there is no requirement under Rule 11 that a

24

defendant be notified.

plea may be that down the line, if he should commit

another crime, he will be subject to a higher sentence

aggravation system such as the Sentencing Guidelines.

7

That is not in the Rule 11 colloquy requirements.

But there's no requirement that the

And there's a reason for that, Your Honor, and
this goes to notice.
QUESTION:

Not only -Mr. Bryson, I'm not talking about the

11

general -- the run of the mill case where the defendant

12

knows when he takes a plea that he is subject to a term of

13

imprisonment.

15

that there's going to be no incarceration.

But this is -- when the judge takes this

I would have given you probation for this criminal act,

this civil judgment for which the defendant did not have a

are effectively a second-time offender in this -- in this

activity and therefore I'm going to give you jail time.

even more to be said for the reliability, if you will, of

It's very different from admitting -Have actual notice.
Yes.
Well, Your Honor, it's not, we

submit, very different from admitting.
QUESTION:

No, I had notice, I just chose not to

appear and a default judgment was taken against me.
MR. BRYSON:

Well, in this case he had full

15

notice and we know from the presentence report, in fact,

16

on the facts of this case, that he actually consulted a

17

lawyer who suggested that since he really wasn't going to

18

contest the case and the arrangement sounded acceptable,

19

no reason to bring a lawyer with him.

20

Now, the final point that I think is worth

21

making on this score is that it has to be emphasized that

22

the penalty for -- in an enhanced setting, in an enhanced

23

sentence setting, the penalty is for the second offense,

24

not the first.

QUESTION:

MR. BRYSON:

In his concurrence in what case?
I'm sorry, in Baldasar.
In Baldasar.
I'm sorry, Your Honor -- made the

6

argument that the fact that you can't directly impose an

7

extra term of - - a term of imprisonment for a misdemeanor

8

conviction is inconsistent with allowing you indirectly to

9

impose it by using that misdemeanor conviction at

10

sentencing for another crime.

11

directly, you can't do it directly.

And if you can't do it

But that I think overlooks the fundamental

12

13

difference between sentencing somebody for a crime and

14

sentencing somebody for a later crime in which you are

15

using the fact of the prior conviction, not to give them

16

extra time because of -- as a means - - as a mode of

17

punishing them for the first conviction, but rather to use

18

as a fact the fact that this person has a criminal

19

history.
And let me just use another hypothetical, if I

20
21

may, to try to demonstrate that point.

Suppose you have

22

someone who is convicted of rape.

23

Georgia, that could not lead to a sentence of death, we

24

know that.

25

murder and the determination of the sentencer is based on

And under Coker against

Suppose that subsequently that person commits

1

the fact of the murder and, as an aggravating

2

circumstance, the fact of the rape, you are going to get

3

the death penalty.

4

Now, in that setting it could be said -- to

5

follow Justice Marshall's analysis, it could be said that

6

the rape, in effect, resulted in the death penalty.

7

yet we know that that isn't a punishment for the rape.

8

That is a punishment for the murder, which is

9

authorized -- the death penalty is authorized because the

person has a history of violent crime.
QUESTION:

Well, another way of looking at it is

12

that we don't really care whether it's for the first or

13

the second or some combination, because both have been

14

counseled convictions.

15

MR. BRYSON:

Well, Your Honor, I'm getting away

16

from the question of counsel here and just asking --

17

addressing right now the question of whether there is

18

force to the logic that was at the base of the concurring

19

opinions in -- of Justice Marshall and Justice --

20

QUESTION:

Well, I think you can argue about

21

whether or not you're being punished for some combination

of the first crime and the second.

12

Counsel suggests that this

But I think it's -- it's, in fact, very

13

important that the States be able to conduct recidivism

14

programs, and to the extent that we do, that the United

15

States be able to do that, in which you do give leniency

16

to someone who is a first-time offender, in which you do

take account of the fact that the person has a criminal

record when they come back and they do it again, and that

1

you do sentence those people much more harshly than you

20

would the first offenders.

21

What, in effect, the rule of Baldasar, if

22

extended to this case, would do is to say that everyone,

23

at least everyone who didn't bring a lawyer with them to a

24

misdemeanor -- a prior misdemeanor proceeding, or who

25

didn't have the State appoint them a lawyer for every

Your Honor, the structure of the Sentencing

I believe it was Lewis, Lewis v. United States,

That is an obvious example also of offenses being

I believe that in this case a rule that

recognizes that this offense is not reliable and perhaps

not fair, perhaps fairness is another -- another element

to believe that this is of little consequence.
