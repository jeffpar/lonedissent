ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. TANKERSLEY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. TANKERSLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents the question of whether the

11

qualified immunity issue in civil rights actions is

12

governed by a special rule that requires that appellate

13

courts treat legal authorities as if they were facts such

14

that the appellate court is required to blind itself to

15

relevant and potentially controlling legal authorities if

16

those authorities were not presented to or considered by

17

the district court below.

18

In the proceedings below the Ninth Circuit ruled

19

that the qualified immunity issue -- on appeal, the legal

20

authorities that are relevant to that must be treated as

21

if they are no other legal authorities other than those

22

that were cited to or discovered by the district court.

23

The appellate court, according to this ruling, may not

24

consider other legal authorities it is aware of even if

25

those authorities demonstrate that, contrary to the

1

district court's ruling, there is no qualified immunity

2

because at the time of the incident it was clearly

3

established that the officer's conduct violated the

4

plaintiff's civil rights.
This is a special rule established only for the

5
6

qualified immunity issue in civil rights cases.
QUESTION:

7

Why do you say that's a special rule?

8

I -- it's been a long time, but my recollection is that

9

foreign law, for example, is a question of fact in the

10

courts.

11

MR. TANKERSLEY:

12

QUESTION:

That is true.

And might not prior law also be --

13

certainly current law is

not -- is not a question of fact,

14

but what was the state of prior law at a particular point

15

in time, why can't that be a - - why isn't that a question

16

of fact?
MR. TANKERSLEY:

17

Well, it's a question of law

18

because in all of this -- this Court's cases dealing with

19

the qualified immunity issue, this Court has stated that

20

it's a pure question of law.

21

that is governed, as with any other question of law, by

22

have --by looking at decisions precedent, statutes, other

23

sources of legal authority.
QUESTION:

24
25

purpose.

That is to

And the ascertainment of

Foreign law --

But it is a question of

law for that

say you determine it by looking at

1

legal authorities.

But the issue of whether it's a

2

question of law for the purpose before us here, just as

3

the question of whether it's a question of law for

4

purposes of whether it's a jury or the judge, there are

5

all sorts of different contexts in which that issue could

6

come up.
And it seems to me that we're looking for an

7
8

essentially factual matter here, aren't we?

What was --

9

on the basis of legal authorities, what was the understood

10

nature -- not what was the real law, because the real law

11

hasn't changed, it's always been the same, but what was

12

the understood nature of the law at that time?

13

question of fact, it seems to me.
MR. TANKERSLEY:

14

That's a

No, I believe that's a question

15

of law, because it's a question which does not go to

16

trying to ascertain evidence in the sense of evidence that

17

may be impeached or contradicted or contradictory.

18

Proof - - burdens of proof ordinarily deal with that kind

19

of problem, dealing with the risk of uncertainty in trying

20

to ascertain from evidence whether or not a particular

21

fact occurred.
QUESTION:

22

23

a question of law, then.

24
25

So foreign law is a question of -- is

MR. TANKERSLEY:

Foreign law is a question that

QUESTION:

It's a question of law --

2

QUESTION:

Well --

3

QUESTION:

-- That's proved like a question of

4

fact, because the materials are often not accessible to

5

the decisionmaker because they're in a foreign language

6

and in a foreign legal culture.

7

witnesses --

8

MR. TANKERSLEY:

9

QUESTION:

So they're proved through

That's true --

-- So to that extent you can call

10

them -- but they're not questions of fact in that they're

11

submitted to a jury to decide.

12

MR. TANKERSLEY:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

That's correct.

And under Rule 44 they are questions

of law, aren't they?
MR. TANKERSLEY:

Foreign law is a question of

16

law, but this Court's decisions have also repeatedly

17

emphasized that certainly questions of Federal law are

18

questions of law, ascertaining what the legal authorities.

19

And, indeed, in Federal courts questions of ascertaining

20

what the State law is is also a question of law on which

21

principles of forfeiture or estoppel because a party

22

didn't introduce particular facts in the proceedings below

23

simply are inapplicable.

24
25

The Court has repeatedly said that in dealing
with deciding a question of law, courts are not limited to

merely selecting among what has been presented by the

2

parties or the contrasting interpretations of the

authorities that have been presented, but have an

4

independent obligation to ascertain what the correct rule

of law is.

And that applies equally in the context of the

QUESTION:

But -- excuse me, but this isn't --

8

we're not looking for what the correct rule of law is.

9

know what the correct rule of law is now.

We

There is a

10

constitutional right.

We are looking for a state of

11

understanding, a state of past understanding, not a state

12

of law.

13

is bear upon that question.

And I don't see how any analogies to what the law

MR. TANKERSLEY:

14

Because the process for

15

determining what the law was is essentially the same

16

process as a court now going to decide what the question

17

is.
QUESTION:

18
19

We're looking for what the law was

thought to be, not for what the law was.
MR. TANKERSLEY:

20

And the process is the same.

21

If the question was what is the law, the first question a

22

court would have to address is is there a prior precedent

23

or statute or other source of authority that clearly

24

establishes what the law in this particular is - - issue

25

is.

And in the qualified immunity context, the inquiry

3.

stops there, but it is the same inquiry as in addressing

2

any other question of law.

3

looks to are the same, the canons of construction that the

4

court uses are the same, the principles that apply are the

S

same.

6

distorts the appellate inquiry.

7

The sources that the court

What this rule does is it alters and, indeed,

QUESTION:

Well, let's -- let's assume that one

8

of the basic elements of the law at that time consisted of

.9

a documents, let's say records of the convention or

10

something, that showed that a particular right was a

11

constitutional right, but that document was -- had not yet

12

been discovered at the time this lawsuit was in action.

13

Now, the issue of when it was discovered is crucial to

14

what the understanding of the law was.

15

to what the law was, it's crucial to the understanding.

16

Do you deny that that's a matter of fact, when was the

17

document discovered?

18
19
20

MR. TANKERSLEY:

It's not crucial

That would -- I'm not sure that

that would necessarily go to a question of fact.
QUESTION:

That --

When -- when the decision was

21

pronounced, whether a Supreme Court decision came down

22

before -- before this litigation or after this, isn't that

23

a question of fact?

24
25

MR. TANKERSLEY:

The date that an authority

becomes known is a factual matter in the sense that it

1

happens on a particular date.

2

in the sense that rules of estoppel or preclusion apply to

3

prohibit an appellate court from considering that on

4

appeal.

5

It is not a factual matter

What was done in the Ninth Circuit here is to

6

translate the concept of burden of proof that applies to

7

fact, in the sense that parties should not be able to

8

introduce new facts into the record on -- in the appellate

9

process, a process that would introduce unfairness into

10

the proceedings because the new facts could not be cross-

11

examined, the other side would not have the same

12

opportunity to rebut those facts in the record.

13

The Ninth Circuit took those principles and

14

translated them to legal authorities where they are

15

inappropriate, whether authorities are equally accessible

16

to both the appellate and the district courts, and to both

17

sides in the litigation.

18

establishing a rule that says an appellate court must

19

announce and, indeed, affirm a legal ruling that is --

20

that is incorrect as a matter of law, demonstrably

21

incorrect, because the authorities necessary to identify

22

the error were not identified below.

QUESTION:

But will it be wrong as a matter of law or wrong

MR. TANKERSLEY:

4

I give you that it will be

It will be an incorrect

5

statement of what the law is, and resolution of what this

6

Court has said is a purely legal issue.
QUESTION:

7

Well, you're -- you're saying, I

8

think, that there may be more -- there may be several

9

questions involved as subsidiary questions in determining

10

whether ultimately a given proposition of law was clearly

11

understood at the time in question.

12

I understand it is, that when there is no question about

13

the availability of the legal materials on which this --

14

this question turns, when the legal materials are, in

15

fact, published law reports, that the only issue that has

16

-- the only question that has to be answered was was there

17

a clear statement of law at that time, and that is itself

18

a question of law.

And your argument, if

Is that your position?

Yes, it is.

3

MR. TANKERSLEY:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. TANKERSLEY:

No.

Okay.
There is no claim that it was

6

inaccessible, and what the Ninth Circuit did here is say

7

that you only look to the district court record, defining

8

the record as being the legal authorities that were also

9

cited.
QUESTION:

10

And I take it the test is an

11

objective test as to what a reasonable officer should

12

know.
MR. TANKERSLEY:

13

It is the same objective test

14

announced in all this Court's qualified immunity cases,

15

terms of what was the announced law at that time in the

16

reporters or other authorities that are accessible and

17

establish law.

established from those authorities that what -- that the

19

conduct violated the plaintiff's civil rights.

Was it reasonably anticipated -- clearly

QUESTION:

to for answering this question.

We agree that it's only-

authorities that are available in the reporters, in the

QUESTION:

do you have to wait for a Ninth Circuit case?

Do the cases talk much about what

circuit conflicts.

If there's a -- if it's the

They do not talk about inter­

The situation in this particular case

10

is that as of the time of the incident there were three

11

circuit court opinions addressing similar factual

12

situations, all of which came out the same way, saying

13

that in a situation where an individual is in a residence

14

and the officers go to arrest him at that residence and

15

effectuate the arrest by surrounding it and ordering him

16

to come out with a show of force, a warrant is required in

17

order to effectuate that arrest, absente exigent

18

circumstances.

19

Since that time there's been one additional

20

decision which also has come out the same way.

21

inter-circuit conflict on this.

25

QUESTION:

There's no

But what the Ninth --

The Ninth Circuit itself just relied

on one, didn't it, that Al-Azzawy opinion?
MR. TANKERSLEY:

Yes.

What was at issue here

was the fact that there was a Ninth Circuit opinion
12

1

directly addressing this issue which was not considered by

2

the district court and which the Ninth Circuit

3

acknowledged might control the outcome in this case.
QUESTION:

4

Well, it was not considered because

5

counsel didn't bring it to the court's attention, I

6

assume.

7

MR. TANKERSLEY:

8

QUESTION:

9

That's correct.

And one can understand a certain

degree of frustration when you have counsel that doesn't

10

call attention to the court an obvious controlling

11

precedent.
MR. TANKERSLEY:

12

That's correct, Your Honor.

13

But this is not about the court's frustration, but about

14

what the proper rule for ascertaining what the correct

15

resolution of the legal issue is here.

16

Circuit did was establish a special rule which essentially

17

says that every appellate court decision issued under this

18

rule only establishes a precedent and announces the rule

19

of law for those particular parties with respect to the

20

particular authorities that were cited in the district

21

court.

22

And what the Ninth

So in order to properly ascertain the

23

precedential effect of an appellate court decision under

24

this rule, you would have to have an appendix identifying

25

the precise authorities that were considered.
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

And as the

1

Ninth Circuit acknowledged, a subsequent case coming up

2

where other authorities were cited would not be governed

3

by that appellate court ruling.
The effect of this is that if two individuals

4
5

were arrested in this particular residence at the time

6

that the petitioner was arrested and the second individual

7

brought a separate 1 83 action for damages, assigned to a

8

separate district court judge who was aware of the
Al-Azzawy decision, and that judge also dismissed the case

10

on the grounds of qualified immunity, in review of that

11

case the Ninth Circuit would be compelled to consider the

12

Al-Azzawy decision and potentially reach a totally

13

different outcome, whereas in this case it was not

14

considered and not part of the legal -- the resolution of

15

the legal issue.
QUESTION:

16

Well, Mr. Tankersley, supposing we

17

agree with you on your main point, what can the district

18

courts or the Ninth Circuit do, if anything, about a

1

situation where a party simply doesn't -- fails to call

20

the district court's attention to what may be a

21

controlling case and raises it for the first time on

22

appeal?

23

Are they just stuck with that?
MR. TANKERSLEY:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

24

it's a big problem, because the incentives for plaintiffs

25

to cite every possible helpful authority are already
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

there.

There's no incentive for -- particularly a

2

plaintiff in this situation, to not cite helpful authority

3

that they're aware of in -QUESTION:

4

Well, but here -- here the district

5

court was really mousetrapped.

I mean, the -- surely a

6

district judge has a right to assume, just as you say,

7

that the parties will have submitted all the relevant

8

authorities.

9

and it turns out that there is an authority on the other

He rules on the basis of those authorities

10

side which was never even mentioned to him by -- by the

11

parties.

12

MR. TANKERSLEY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

13

But the only effect of this rule and the fact that you're

14

able to consider this additional authority on appeal is

15

that the appellate court may decide that the district

16

court's resolution of the legal issue was wrong.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. TANKERSLEY:

That --

Well -That is something which follows

19

from the fact that it is the role of appellate courts to

20

correct legal errors, even if they are due to an oversight

21

in the proceedings in the district court.

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well an oversight on the part of

counsel who have simply failed to do their job.
MR. TANKERSLEY:

It -- it was an oversight on

the part of counsel, but it was also a matter of fact that

1

this case was on the books and in opinions that the

2

district court also relied upon.
QUESTION:

3

The fact of the --

May I ask, Mr. Tankersley, do you

4

understand the Ninth Circuit's rule to apply only to the

5

qualified immunity defense, or is it a general rule that

6

applies to any kind of comparable situation?
MR. TANKERSLEY:

7

I understand this rule to

8

apply -- to be a interpretation of this Court's language

9

in Davis v. Scherer, and for that reason to apply only to

10

the qualified immunity defense on the basis that they

11

interpreted that language, which says that the plaintiff

12

must show that the law was clearly established, as

13

providing that legal authorities in this unique context

14

are to be treated as if they were matters of fact, legal

15

facts.

So it does not extend to other contexts.
Although the issue that Justice -- Justice

16
17

Rehnquist has -- or Mr. Chief Justice has raised has --

18

applies equally to other contexts where legal issues are

19

at stake.

20

a motion for summary judgment, it is also the case that

21

the parties, as a matter of persuading the court, have to

22

bring before the court whatever helpful legal authorities

23

they have.

1

claims by civil rights plaintiffs merely on the fact that

2

the authority was not cited below.

3

The effect of this is that an appellate court

4

will be required to affirm the dismissal of a civil rights

5

claim by a victim of a civil rights violation, not on the

6

basis that the official's conduct should be subject to an

7

immunity under the balance of the interests that this

8

Court has identified, but solely on the basis that the

9

necessary authorities were not cited in the court below.

10

This results in an unjust resolution of cases,

11

because it is - - it has to be accepted that the proper

12

application of these interests and the test established in

13

Harlow results in the proper disposition of civil rights

14

cases where the qualified immunity issue is presented.

15

But this rule provides that there will be a different

16

resolution in particular cases, depending upon what the

17

citations of authority in the district court were.

18

As enunciated by the Ninth Circuit, this rule

19

applies regardless of whether the party is represented or

20

not, regardless of how severe the official misconduct is,

21

and regardless of how serious the injury that the civil

22

rights plaintiff suffered.

1

harshly on pro se plaintiffs and individuals who have

2

limited access to legal representation, but what this rule

3

does is elevate that imperfection into a rule of law.

4

In summary, the rule that's been announced by

5

the Ninth Circuit is wrong precisely because it alters the

6

appellate process so that legal research during the

7

district court proceedings will alter the appellate

8

court's responsibility of correcting legal errors and

9

making sure that legal issues were determined based on all

10

the authorities that the appellate court is aware of.

11

is also wrong because there is no justification for

12

denying a meritorious civil rights claim or creating an

13

immunity for an officer based on what particular

14

authorities were cited in the district court.

relied upon for authority and the issue would then arise

11

whether or not an unpublished opinion is relevant for the

12

clearly established determination, which is one that,

13

thankfully, is not presented in this case, and as far as I

know has not been addressed by this Court or the courts of

issue of whether there can be any precedential value to

decisions under the Ninth Circuit's regime, as I

19

understand the Ninth Circuit it is not mandatory that

you -- that you not take account of opinions not cited,

21

it's simply optional.

22

could say we are conducting a thoroughgoing review of this

issue on our own, not simply relying upon the cases cited

MR. TANKERSLEY:

2

I disagree with that, in that,

as I read the Ninth Circuit opinion, at the appellate

level they read this Court's decision in Davis v. Scherer

as mandating that the appellate court is not to take into

account other decisions that it's aware of, that it

believes are relevant, that, in fact, it thinks may be

First, then, we would like to address the
qualified immunity issue.

7

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Davis, the question

8

presented in the petition for certiorari is basically the

9

one I believe Mr. Tankersley was arguing, that is whether

10

the appeals court should be able to disregard legal

11

authorities that were not cited to the district court.

12

presume you're going to deal with that question, are you

13

not?
MR. DAVIS:

To look at the

Mr. Davis -- I think I speak for my

7

colleagues as well -- if the Ninth Circuit had simply

8

decided this qualified immunity issue on the merits one

9

way or the other, we never would have granted certiorari.

10

The point we granted certiorari on was the Ninth Circuit's

11

rule that if a case wasn't cited to the district court on

12

the basis -- to show the existing state of the law at the

13

time, it couldn't be relied upon by the court of appeals.

14

That's what we want to try to decide here.

15

MR. DAVIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, I will -- I'm

16

familiar with the Washington Yakima Indian Nation case,

17

which would allow the party who was successful below to

18

rely on any grounds, but in deference to the Court I will

19

proceed to address the issue.
What petitioner would ask this Court to do is

20
21

decide the standard of review question in a vacuum.

22

23

resolved the burden of proof question, which it raised on

its own.

there were an identical case to yours in another district

had been cited, that the results should be different?

4

MR. DAVIS:

The answer to that is, yes, that can

happen, but it can happen any time a court of appeals

6

exercises the abuse of discretion standard or any time

7

that a counsel mistakenly doesn't present either a factual

basis or a legal basis for their claim.

And we would apply the same rule --

in this case defendant -- plaintiff was counseled, but

11

MR. DAVIS:

That's correct.

12

Again, I would like to go back and advise the

13

Court that this decision was not made in a vacuum. The

14

court of appeals first determined that the plaintiff has

15

the burden of proof or burden of persuasion as to what

16

clearly established law is.

17

which I believe is justified by this Court's decisions and

18

by the policy considerations cited in the brief, the issue

19

it had to address, and which this Court granted certiorari

20

on, is the standard of review to be applied.

21

of proof would be a meaningless decision placed on the

22

plaintiff if the plaintiff was allowed at some later time

23

to amend or add additional authorities.

I am not treating it as fact.

I

am - - as I understand this Court's precedents and as all

of the circuit courts, except for the Third, have

understood this Court's precedents, it is up to the

plaintiff to make some showing in response to a

7

defendant's motion for summary judgment that there was a

QUESTION:

9

And I am not likening --

But you've already said it's really

10

not up to the plaintiff because if the judge had found the

But the district judge doesn't have

MR. DAVIS:

19

The -- if this Court adopts the burden of proof

20

standard that the Ninth Circuit has put in place and that

21

all of the other circuits have put in place, that the

22

plaintiff must show the clearly established law, then the

24

a logical extension of that rule.

plaintiff's counsel to locate the case that was ultimately

result of the failure to cite case law which clearly

what prompted this decision.

QUESTION:

invited error really applies.

It was invited error.

The

That is

Well, I'm not sure whether the term
I'm just trying to think

the thing through.

I think of invited error as being

typically a -- when you yourself request an instruction to

a jury that you later -- that you later regret, and there

13

you have something quite different here, that it can't be

deliberations.
But here there was never any relinquishment, as

You do.

All right.

But the lawyer who did

argue it did not discharge a very elementary professional

obligation.

MR. DAVIS:

I would have to say, Your Honor,

that it is a case that - - if I had been there, I would

20

have provided to the district court judge.

21

believe that the Al-Azzawy decision is distinguishable

from the case that we presented, and that -- and the

ethical distinction --

MR. DAVIS:

That's

all of these cases have relied upon is that there was

What my officers did was they had the suspect's

12

case -- suspect's brother in this case get on the

13

telephone and call him and ask him to come out.

14

see how using the telephone and asking him to come out can

15

be any more intrusive than going and knocking on the door

16

and having the suspect come out.

Botero the law was not clearly established in the Ninth

Circuit that what my officer did did not -- would not

The one thing that I do want to caution this

petitioner's argument that the appellate court has a duty

Mr. Davis, just -- I want to go back

to one thing you said.

facts as the Ninth Circuit reported them, Holloway, that's

the defendant, advised him, him being Elder, that if he

was unable to walk out of the house, he should crawl.
MR. DAVIS:

6

That is correct.

But in the

The record

establishes that the initial telephone contact was made by

8

the brother, and it was after the brother had talked to

9

his -- to Mr. Elder, the suspect who was in the house,

10

that the officer got on the phone to ask him what the

11

problem was.

12

that he'd had a seizure and had been injured inside the

13

home.

Because at that point Mr. Elder was saying

QUESTION:

But the -- that -- that indicates it

16

was the officer who got him to come out of the house and

17

not the brother.

18

MR. DAVIS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

My

19

point was not who made the contact.

My point was in the

20

Ninth Circuit we had a case, U.S. v. Botero, where the

21

officers knocked on the door and the suspect came out and

22

he was arrested, and that was held to be an appropriate

23

arrest under the Fourth Amendment.

24

officers did was have the brother, or the officer, talk to

him and ask him to come out, and I don't see how that is

My point is what my

any more intrusive than the circumstance where the officer

knocks on the door.

And it's certainly consistent, at least

4

according to the Ninth Circuit, with United States v.

Santana, in which it was held that a person standing in

QUESTION:

You don't see a difference between an

8

officer knocking on the door and asking someone politely

9

to come out and an officer saying to someone inside of a

10

house if you can't stand up, crawl out?
MR. DAVIS:

11

At the time that statement was made

12

the man claimed that he had had a seizure, and the officer

13

was telling him to crawl out so that he didn't risk

14

injury.

15

so he was familiar with epilepsy and he was simply

16

advising him to come out in a safe manner.

17

In the record, Holloway's wife is an epileptic,

MR. DAVIS:

The Ninth Circuit does not let you

That is my understanding under the

circumstances of this case.

If you look at the way the

8

Ninth Circuit framed the issue, they framed it by saying

9

failed to cite to the district court and failed to cite to

1

us on appeal, and I think they were exasperated and

11

frustrated by the fact that at oral argument they said

So I think their

The panel decision does maintain the court as a
