ORAL ARGUMENT OF RALPH G. WELLINGTON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WELLINGTON:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
These two consolidated cases from the Third

10
11

Circuit arise from different factual circumstances, but

12

present a single fundamental issue from their holdings:

13

Do railroads have a broad duty, under the Federal

14

Employers Liability Act, to protect their employees from

15

all genuine and foreseeable emotional harm, even in the

16

absence of physical impact or reasonable fear of physical

17

impact?

18

This Court, in 1987, in its decision in the

19

Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe v. Buell case, discussed but

20

did not decide whether claims for emotional injury were

21

cognizable under the FELA.

22

and State courts around the country have wrestled with

23

that fundamental question, and with the legal principles

24

to be applied in answering it.

25

And since that time, Federal

Although different analyses have been applied by

1

different courts, most -- indeed, all, so far, until the

2

Third Circuit, have recognized the need to have reasonable

3

limits on recovery for such claims of emotional distress.

4

Only the Third Circuit, in the decisions below, has

5

expressly rejected the experience of the common law and

6

the limited tests of duty developed at common law with

7

respect to emotional harm.

8

the court determined that the duty of railroads under the

9

FELA, and I quote only a phrase from the appendix, page 52

And in its Gottshall decision,

10

of the writ -- appendix to the writ of certiorari, they

11

held that the duty under the FELA, quote, includes a duty

12

to guard against conditions in the work place that cause

13

emotional harm to employees, end quote.

14

This duty was then applied in the Carlisle

15

decision to hold for the first time that railroads can be

16

subjected to damages under the FELA for general work place

17

stress.

18

We believe those decisions to be error.
At the outset, I wish to make Conrail's position

19

on the issue clear.

20

circumstances the FELA may provide recovery for some

21

claims of emotional distress.

22

that the word "injury" in the statute precludes recovery

23

for all emotional harm.

24

inquiry is whether negligence in the statute imposes a

25

general duty to guard against conditions in the work place

We do not dispute that under some

In short, we do not argue

Rather, we believe the critical

2

that cause emotional harm.
Since there was no independent duty for --at

3

common law at the time the FELA was enacted to avoid

4

negligent infliction of emotional distress, and since

5

there is no evidence that Congress intended to include in

6

the FELA a duty under negligence that was not included at

7

common law at the time, we believe that no such general

8

duty exists and should not be imposed by the courts.

9

QUESTION:

So, you think the duty to guard

10

against emotional injury is a more limited one than the

11

duty imposed by the Act to guard against physical injury?

12

MR. WELLINGTON:

Yes, Your Honor, we do.

If - -

13

if one looks --as this Court recently, in Morgan

14

Monessen, observed, it's important to look at the

15

historical context of the FELA and the legislative history

16

at the time.

17

1908, there was no general duty at common law to avoid the

18

negligent infliction of emotional distress.

19

is no such general duty today.

20

And at the time the FELA was enacted in

Indeed, there

What the common law has done in the last 80

21

years or so is carve out certain limited exceptions,

22

defined by zone of danger test, bystander test, that

23

permit some limited recovery under some circumstances.

24

And we believe that if one begins with looking at the

25

statute and its historical context, that you cannot assume

1

that Congress, in 1 08, included -- intended to impose a

2

duty on the railroads that was not then recognized at

3

common law and, indeed -QUESTION:

4

Well, is it possible, though, that

5

the common law can change over time, and that a duty could

6

evolve, and that perhaps the Act is broad enough to

7

encompass those changing notions?

8

10

QUESTION:

Absolut --

QUESTION:

At least there's some suggestion to

that effect, I think, in some of this Court's language.
MR. WELLINGTON:

11

Absolutely, Justice O'Connor,

12

that's correct.

And we recognize that this Court has

13

interpreted the statute as evolving with common law.

14

within the statutory framework originally enacted, for

15

example, in the Urie decision, where this Court real --

16

held that injury in the statute includes injury over time

17

from a deleterious substance, not just impact injury.

18

That's, I think, an appropriate development with common

1

law.

But

But, in Morgan, as the Court indicated, and as

20
21

we believe here, where there was no -- in fact, where the

22

statute could not have included the duty at the outset,

23

and Congress has chosen not to include it through the next

24

80 years or so, we think it's inappropriate to include a

25

new duty.

MR. WELLINGTON:

I do not believe there is,

17

Justice Kennedy.

18

Gottshall, in a -- in reviewing the summary judgment,

19

analyzed Mr. Gottshall's claim on a traditional zone of

20

danger analysis.

And it determined that he was not within

21

a zone of danger.

In fact, in the Third Circuit, as the

22

record reflects, Mr. Gottshall argued that the zone of

23

danger was the inappropriate test to analyze his claim

24

because he recognizes he's not within the zone of danger.

that the FELA is frozen in a certain time or whether this

statute, which uses the words "injury," uses the word

"negligence," whether this is a charter to the courts to

courts are, and State courts, over time, have changed the

Is - - are the Federal courts in the same

It was supposed to take some sort of a

MR. WELLINGTON:

5

That's what

It is not just the common law

What we -- what we believe is

7

2

made another modification, by statute, to change basic

3

negligence principles that had been enacted in the

statute.

5

But at the time this statute was enacted, and

6

indeed, today, as I - - as I've mentioned, there is, at the

7

common law, no general duty to protect against emotional

harm.

1908 Congress intended that duty, without having reflected

For that duty to have -- for us to assume that in

on the date of this Act, or did Congress mean the Federal

And I -- I still haven't got a clear fix,

1

2

because you seem to be backtracking now, on whether you're

3

saying the Third Circuit didn't take the sensible position

4

for a common law court dealing with concepts of negligence

5

and injury to be taking, or there are additional

6

constraints that the FELA places on the Federal courts

7

that would not be placed on, say, the courts of

8

Pennsylvania in determining the extent of liability for

9

infliction of emotional distress.
MR. WELLINGTON:

Your Honor, what I am saying --

11

or - - and our position is that both of those things are

12

true.

MR. WELLINGTON:

8

9

Yes, it cannot result from a

working condition, whether that working condition be heat,

10

cold, heavy lifting, work, stress, because the result is,

11

if the plaintiff is permitted to recover, not because he's

12

been injured by that condition, but because he's -- he's

13

uncomfortable or afraid or concerned about working in that

condition, you now open up as potential plaintiffs under

dynamic statute that is meant to include causes of action

in specific injuries and specific classes of employees

3

that may not have been originally contemplated by

4

Congress.

5

QUESTION:

Why is that?

I mean, it is rather

6

extraordinary.

I'm not used to being a common law judge.

7

I usually have a statute in front of me, and I give it the

8

beginning it had when it was enacted.

9

colleagues look to the committee reports and the

Indeed, some of my

10

legislative history to see what Congress thought the

11

meaning was at the time it was enacted, and if that's what

12

they thought, that meaning doesn't change, even if, in

13

light of, you know, better knowledge, we -- it would

14

better have a different meaning.

What is different about FELA that -- that
converts us into common law courts?

MR. MYERS:

The -- this Court found in Kernan,

itself did not want the FELA to be limited to the specific

types of injuries or the specific class of employees --

QUESTION:

22

MR. MYERS:

Is that in the statute?
That's not in the statute.

And

23

that's -- and that's actually part of our position.

Congress deliberately worded this statute in broad

25

language.

It set up a flexible scheme.

That it's acquired a different meaning today?
MR. MYERS:

Not that it has acquired a different

meaning, but that some specific injuries are covered

10

today, and have been for many years, that are different

11

from the types of injuries Congress was thinking about.

12

QUESTION:

Is that different from what I said?

13

Are you or are you not saying that some injuries are

14

covered today which were not covered at the time the

15

statute was passed?

16

MR. MYERS:

No, Your Honor.

I'm saying that

some injuries today are covered that were not considered

You wouldn't argue that to a jury?

Gee, I'd argue that to a jury.

MR. MYERS:

Your Honor, I think that in any

there is physical discomfort, there may be some level of

MR. MYERS:

5

I think that Your Honor's point is

The

7

Federal statute isn't bound by State common law for those

reasons.

Additionally, the availability of the Railway

Labor Act as an alternative mechanism for dispute

resolution would tend to minimize these claims, where

11

people would come in to court and try to assert a claim

that their -- their supervisor annoys them, or their

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. MICHAEL FARRELL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT CARLISLE
MR. FARRELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I will frame the issue just a little bit

14

differently, because I think the issue that this Court is

15

presented with here is whether Conrail's distrust of the

16

twin pillars of the American justice system -- and that is

17

the jury and the adversarial system -- should persuade

18

this Court to ignore the text of the FELA and the broad

19

remedial purposes as - - as the commitments of this Court

20

over almost the last century have revealed, to ignore

21

genuine, severe and foreseeable injury resulting from the

22

negligence of the railroad.

MR. FARRELL:

Yes, Your Honor, I believe that is

correct.

11

lawyers approach common law, I believe the common law

would embody both -- and -- and I'll get to your question

in a little different way, contrasting whether --

it's not the brooding omnipresence, it's the law of a

MR. FARRELL:

Absolutely.

And let me go right

18

to -- to your -- to the answer to your question.

And

19

that's Spade v. Lynn and Massachusetts Railroad, which was

20

-- which was the American case that was specifically

21

addressed by Just -- Judge Kennedy -- excuse me -- of the

22

King's Bench in Dulieu, in which -- in Spade v. -- v. Lynn

Conrail ignored the 1929 studies that revealed the

dangerous medical consequences, bodily consequences, that

report of the FRA, which confirmed those results; they

12

ignored the 1987 assessment of the very office that found

13

the conditions there hazardous, that found the staff

14

inadequate, that found the work excessive, that found that

15

there was no visual assistance whatsoever to assist train

And that leads me

QUESTION:

21

That's a Workmen's Compensation case,

but why should it be a negligence case?
MR. FARRELL:

Good question, because that brings

me over to Justice O'Connor, who I think asked a question,

isn't there another remedy here?

And I might point out that they absolutely

misstate the law with respect to Workmen's Compensation in

the United States.

industry would have recovery for an emotional injury which

was foreseeable and was an essential consequence of their

The law of Workmen's Compensation in

But let's talk a little bit about the zone

of danger that I think - QUESTION:

I was going to ask that question.

I

12

guess you -- there's just a conflict on that, because, as

13

I recall the Petitioner's brief, the assertion is made

14

that -- that emotional injury is generally not

15

recoverable.

16

MR. FARRELL:

Judge, I -- I believe I've cited

QUESTION:

19

MR. FARRELL:

Under Workmen's Comp.
Goyden v. -- I forget the

20

defendant's name -- a New Jersey case, which essentially

holds that if in fact the emotional injury is causally

related to an essential aspect of that employee's work,

that emotional injury is fully compensable.

And it seems to me to undercut your case --

2

MR. FARRELL:

3

QUESTION:

That's why - -

If what you are saying is that this

4

statute must somehow be construed so that negligence in

5

this statute is parallel to Workmen's Compensation

6

standards for recovery in the States.

7

MR. FARRELL:

Judge -- Justice, let me please

8

comment on that.

Because, actually, if you look at the

9

law of Workmen's Compensation in this area -- for

10

instance, the case of Hammerle, which is the Pennsylvania

11

Workmen's Compensation that recognizes the compensability

12

of emotional injury, the test is:

13

illness a reasonable reaction to an abnormal working

14

circumstance?

Workmen's Compensation type of case in Pennsylvania that

16

actually requires proof of fault -- proof of showing that

17

the condition was abnormal.

Which, actually, it is the -- the only

18

So, it's very interesting in this area that in

19

-- in the emotional recovery area in Workmen's Comp, the

20

test does include the reasonable person test, which is a

21

negligence concept.

22

subjective reaction, it is an objective test in Workmen's

23

Compensation.

And that is, this is not a -- a

generally to the mention of Workmen's Compensation.

But I

2

mention it because of Justice O'Connor's question, so that

3

this Court understands that what Conrail is really arguing

4

here is that an entire class of genuine, foreseeable, real

5

and severe injuries go completely uncompensated in the

6

face of the clear language of the statute in 1908 that

7

every injury suffered at the hands of the negligence of

8

the railroad, in whole or in part, should be in fact

compensated.
And there's a couple of other points that I want

to make as a matter of proof.

13

its confidence in the American adversary system and in the

whether there is too much risk of -- of runaway awards,

whether the employer is going to be excessively burdened

MR. FARRELL:

If I might return to the initial

2

discussion that I had about the Dulieu case, Judge, I --

3

Justice, I believe that it was in fact a duty that existed

4

at common law that, at the time of the Spade v. Lynn and

5

Massachusetts decision, there were these concerns about

6

the administration -- that is, fraudulent claims and

7

unforeseeable liability or - - excuse me - - potential

8

liability -- caused the court to adopt certain crutches

9

that in fact were really examples of meritorious cases.

10

We have now developed medical science to such a

11

point -- and the adversarial system allows the medical

12

science -- the competing medical views of the causation,

13

of the seriousness of an emotional injury, under the

14

reasonable man standard, to compete in the marketplace of

15

the courtroom, and to allow the jury, with proper

16

instructions, to decide what, in fact, Spade v. Lynn kind

17

of threw up its hands and say, we'll use these crutches,

18

the physical impact doctrine.

19

Let me also make a point --

I don't think that - - I - - I think

wouldn't say yes, that was an injury.

It means physical injury, something that's -- that's

physically demonstrable.

It isn't an injury.

5

MR. FARRELL:

Let me - - let me make a point

under the Restatement.

7

actually Justice Ginsburg kind of hinted at.

8

that, frankly, under the Restatement, specifically, 313,

9

if in fact a reasonable person would foresee that their

And that is

10

conduct would result in emotional distress that would

11

result in bodily harm, that that is injury.
Our position, the petition of the Respondents in

12

13

this case, is that injury, as used in the statute, means

14

both mental and physical injury.

15

Court said in Urie, there is nothing in the statute that

16

would indicate an intention to exclude any class of

17

injuries or class of employees, and -- and any attempt to

18

read in such a limitation would be, quote, sheer

inference.

They are simply saying, do not provide for

compensation for those injuries until certain other

conditions have been met -- the conditions that are

to read emotional injury totally out of the statute.

They're not asking this Court or any Federal court

MR. FARRELL:

QUESTION:

Let me address that --

And -- and if -- if it is not read --

I guess the question should be, if it is not read totally

10

out of the statute, then how, even on your premise, can we

11

say that we, in effect, are defying the intention of

12

Congress?

13

MR. FARRELL:

Your Honor, the problem with zone

14

of danger tests -- and I think it was a question that --

15

that Justice Kennedy asked -- is that it is so fortuitous.

If in fact Mr. Gottshall --

we're not reading the entire class of emotional injuries

21

can it be said that we are defying the intention of

question, I believe, theoretically, that -- that this

remedy is a dynamic remedy, and this Court, consistent

with guidance from the common law or medical science,

could contract the remedy, as well as -- as expand it.
However, consistent with medical science as well

6

7

as the development of common law - - and common law courts

8

all across this country, with respect to recovery for

With respect to

10

the ability to identify, to measure, to scientifically

present and defend the existence of real emotional injury,

it has expanded.

So, Your Honor, I -- I believe he's not writing

it out of the statute.

he's picking the test which is the most -- the broadest

reject, and not be counseled by the fears that Conrail

interpreting.

to the common law.

What we must keep in mind is that the common

5

law, however, has -- does give us the experience of

6

dealing with these claims over several decades.

the basic justification that the Third -- that the FELA is

11

a broad remedial statute.

12

But that does not answer the question - - it is

13

not a justification for doing away with that experience.

Nor is it enough to say we'll, send everything to the

jury.

17

over its decades, has reviewed a number of cases and

But your position is there was no

MR. WELLINGTON:

QUESTION:

9

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.

Because there was no violation of a

particular duty to these two employees?
MR. WELLINGTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Yes, I want to be sure.

QUESTION:

Well, and on that point, it seems to

me that the duty that is being argued is the duty of the

employer not to avoid stress but to use necessary due care
