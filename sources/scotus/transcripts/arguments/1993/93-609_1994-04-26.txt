ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

We'll hear argument

MR. BENKARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
Petitioners contend that section 27A of the

15

Securities and Exchange Act violates the Constitution of

16

the United States insofar as section 27A permits the

17

reopening of final judgments granted to private parties in

18

actions that are entirely closed.

19

The issues before this Court are whether the

20

statute constitutes an impermissible infringement upon the

21

principle of the separation of powers and upon the powers

22

of the judiciary and upon the individual rights of those

23

litigants who appears before the courts.

The Courts of Appeals for the Sixth and the
Tenth Circuits, as well as seven District Courts who have

2

statute is in irreconcilable conflict with rules of law

handed down by venerable and respected precedents of this

4

Court.

5

violates the Constitution.

6

The Fifth Circuit, from whose order we appeal,

7

reached a contrary conclusion in large part on the basis

8

of their holding that it was quite permissible for

9

Congress to compel the courts to share parts of their

Consequently, they have held that the statute

We submit that that holding is unprecedented.
It is wrong.

And it should be reversed.

Now, as I have said, our challenge is based upon

14

two related grounds.

16

and authoritatively interpreted and implemented by this

17

Court in Hayburn's Case.

18

The first is the separation of

There is no question but that section 27A

19

constitutes such an intrusion or an interference.

20

Secondly, there is the point of the rights of the

21

individuals which we -- we contend that the judgment of

22

the District Court, in essence, terminating Federal

23

securities claims against the Petitioners constitutes a

24

divestment of our due process rights.

3

the legislation reactions -- some might say it was

4

overblown -- but, in any event, there was no discussion

that we can find, and Respondents, I don't believe, have

cited any, of the constitutional problems which bring us

here today.

Indeed, the Respondent set forth at some length

We do know that a statute was passed which
overruled Beam, in essence -- or at least the part of the
statute that we are here today on -QUESTION:

Why -- why did it overrule it?

It

12

simply provided a different statute of limitations, and

13

what Congress does is enact statutes, including those

14

involving limitations.

MR. BENKARD:

16
17

But they can't reverse undue final

judgments, Justice Souter.

Well, they -- they didn't -- you --

have been done by the Congress in Hayburn's Case.

MR. BENKARD:

This -- this was not an instance --

what I'm getting at is this is not an instance in which

there was an individualized action by Congress on a

which have interpreted Hayburn's Case in that way.

MR. BENKARD:

2

That -- there's no question, Your

Honor.

And this is an argument that Respondent, Pacific

Mutual, makes:

a party, as opposed to coming before.

7

that somehow it makes a difference that a

With all due respect, Your Honor, we say the

8

interference is worse when it comes in the latter

9

situation.

At least in the -- in the previous one, the

10

parties have some chance; they have some knowledge it's

11

coming.

divested the power of the judiciary even -- even more so.

When the statute comes afterwards, it -- it has

QUESTION:

Mr. Benkard, you're talking about the

timing of the legislation.

15

the substance of the legislation that is in Hayburn's

Case.

18

modifying whatever initial decision the judiciary made?

I would like you to consider

Is it not true that, effectively, the legislature

19

So, the judiciary was being considered as sort

20

of a first instance tribunal, and then came the

21

legislature or the executive -- I forgot which -- but,

22

anyway, the other branches, putting themselves over the

23

judiciary on the question of the substantive rights of the

claimant.

)

Here it's an actuality.
The -- but the actuality is what?

This case involves a statute of limitations.

4

MR. BENKARD:

5

QUESTION:

Correct.

Is it not so that as between the

6

judiciary and the legislature, statutes of limitations are

7

in the legislature -- legislature's court?

8

legislature doesn't act, then the Court has to make

9

something up, and feels intensely uncomfortable doing so

10

because statutes of limitations are, by their nature,

11

arbitrary.

MR. BENKARD:

If I may segue then, they have in

so, between deciding the merits of the a case -- does the

Congress can come here when they don't like a result and

say, all we're doing is remanding it back to have another

look at it, and if we have some kind of a sharing of

judicial authority, you get two things:

If

10

you get an erosion of the autonomy, it seems to me, of

this Court and the courts -- the other courts as well.

Not only that, you get institutional disharmony.

that it'd be a different matter if Congress simply passed

And the fundamental point I think about this

statute is that it is legislative equally, whether

3

Congress applied it to pending cases or to final cases.

4

The reason that this -- that there is no challenge in this

5

case to -- or in -- in any event, it is now conceded, as

6

seven Circuits have held -- that section 27A is fully

7

legislative, as applied to pending cases, is that the

8

relevant constitutional line has to do with the difference

9

between adjudication and legislation.

And that line is no

10

more crossed when Congress acts with respect to pending or

11

final cases.

12

Indeed, our submission is that if Congress -- to

13

take Justice Stewart -- Justice Souter's example --

14

undertook to consider the particular facts of a particular

15

case, and to apply the law itself to that case, that would

16

be equally unconstitutional in a pending case as it would

in a final case.

right.

But I -- I don't think that the separation of

of law is not the exercise of judicial, is dependent on

7

the fact that the United States is a party there, any more

kinds of challenges, legislation reopening Territorial

11

Court judgments, where there were private defendants.

I think the private defendant has to do with two

things -- one, the due process issue, and, two, the source

All right.

I think that --

changing the law to a whole class of cases that have been

we are now changing the law to provide for an affirmative

Can Congress do that?

the longstanding presumption against retroactive

legislation, including, I think, this kind, reflects

deep-seated fairness concerns that is what, over the

years, in fact, inhibits Congress or other legislatures

from doing this sort of thing on any kind of -- in any --

in any way that would have generated this precise case in

Congress would do this on -- on any number of occasions.

I think you're implying -- the judgment is --

And because not every interference with a

property right is a due process violation, the mere fact

that the judgment giving rise to the property right is

there should not, for separation purposes, be regarded as

you're saying?
MR. TARANTO:

Well, let me -- let me see if I

can respond this way.

purposes, there is no charismatic significance to a

tell, either reflect anything in the text -- unlike the

9

formal lines relined on in Chada and Bowsher and that line

of cases, or the underlying constitutional principle.

There are political judgments to be made in saying what

There are in -- politically independent fact

QUESTION:

Well, one of your broadest answers is

the line has got to be drawn somewhere.
MR. TARANTO:

I think that the line has to be

21

drawn by looking at whether what Congress has done is to

22

make a adjudicatory decision, whether it acts too

narrowly, whether it explicitly changes the law, whether

it makes very case specific kind of fact findings.

why there's no dispute any longer about the validity of

Now, on the due process side, it seems to me

important to keep in mind the two different roles

judgments can play.

6

a right in a judgment -- like a judgment lien.

don't understand that there's been any argument that that

kind of property right should somehow be treated as more

sacrosanct than the right of title to property or a

A judgment can create a new right --

contract right.

11

The other kind of right is what's talked about

12

in all the cases concerning rights vested by a judgment.

13

And the judgment there simply plays the role of confirming

14

the legal entitlement.

15

And it seems to me, again, upside-down to say

16

that if the legal entitlement was so clear and

indisputable that it never gave rise to litigation in the

18

first place, that is subject only to due process

rationality; whereas if it was sufficiently disputable and

ambiguous that litigation resulted, that somehow the

result -- again, the underlying right is the property

Congress cannot itself exercise judicial power that is

litigate their securities fraud cases on the merits after

think that it explains why there have been, particularly

since Chevron v. Huson has been decided, why there have

consider the need to frame what is, in essence, a

Whether there is a difference under any other

doctrine in the Constitution, such as the due process

clause or the takings clause, raises a more difficult

This case, I

1

There is no tradition or any source of law that the

2

Petitioners can point to that says that a judgment that

3

rests on a statute of limitations is somehow a species of

4

property.

5

is -- is not regarded as the kind of property that -- that

6

the Government would take.

7

The right not to litigate a claim on the merits

In any event, it's not clear how the Government

8

acquired this right, even if it is one.

And it's

9

certainly not a case where it would be unfair to require

10

Petitioners to assume the burden of litigating on the

11

merits their securities fraud case and paying a judgment

12

if in fact they -- they committed securities fraud under

13

what everybody acknowledges is preexisting liability.

14

This is not something that the public should

15

bear, rather than Petitioners.

16

as raising any takings problem either.

17

So, I don't see this case

Congress does act circumspectly in changing the

18

law with respect to cases that have gone final.

19

there is, of course, a well settled distinction in the law

20

between pending cases and final cases.

There are other settings in which what is, in

essence, the doctrine of res judicata; the doctrine of

24

repose is overridden by a congressional determination that

25

relitigation of a claim should go forward.

QUESTION:

The Sioux

Mr. Dreeben, does the Government have

6

any case other than Sioux Nation in -- in which Congress

7

has done this -- set aside an extant judgment?
MR. DREEBEN:

8

10

Well, the other cases that -- that

were the ones that Sioux Nation relied on, which are also
cases in which the Government was --

11

QUESTION:

The Government was a party?

12

MR. DREEBEN:

13

QUESTION:

So --

No case, in -- in which a private

14

party was a party to the judgment, has Congress ever tried

15

to set it aside?
MR. DREEBEN:

case.

But we rely --we don't rely --

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. DREEBEN:

20
21

I am not sure that there is no

But you don't know of any?
No.

We don't rely on any

precedent of this Court that says that.
I don't think, for separation of powers

22

purposes, it should make a difference.

In fact, if there

23

should be any litigant whose ability to require the

24

Federal courts to relitigate issues should be most suspect

25

it would probably be the United States.

Because the

1

United States would have the -- the greatest capacity to,

2

in some way, undermine the independence of the judiciary

3

by treating its cases in some sort of a favored way.
QUESTION:

way, as it did in Sioux Nation, there is certainly no

problem.

7

1

But when it treats it as a disfavored

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, no problem except to the

8

extent that the principle that is at issue is the

9

independent of the courts to render final judgments on

10

particular claims that shall never, under any

11

circumstances, be relitigated again.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W.B. BENKARD

16

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

Thank you, Mr. Dreeben.

MR. BENKARD:

18

Number one, the concept that this statute is not

19

an interference, and that the courts can do whatever they

20

want when they get back is belied by the language of the

21

statute itself, which states that upon such a motion --

22

excuse me -- upon such a showing, the case shall -- shall

23

--be reinstated on motion by the plaintiff.

24
25

There is no discretion left to the court.
Congress has told them what to do.

QUESTION:

1

2

Well, but the statute is not

self-executing.
MR. BENKARD:

3

That is correct, Your Honor.

But

4

anybody with a first year law student's education knows

5

what to do with that statute, sir.
Number two, Hayburn's Case is supposedly

6

7

irrelevant because there are no host judgment cases around

8

-- supposedly -- no cases where the judgment's effect has

9

been taken away, or no executive action.
I would ask the Court, in your leisure time, to

10
11

look at page 10 of our reply brief, where we have cited

12

three cases from this -- this Court, including the 0'Grady

13

decision, which was cited by Chief Justice Rehnquist, in

14

-- in Sioux Nation, as well as two others -- Jefferson and

15

Waters, as well as, I might add, Your Honors, many cases

16

from the Circuit Courts of Appeal and the State Supreme

17

Courts, on which my learned adversaries turn a Nelsonian

18

eye.

19
20
21

There is not a word addressed to a single one of
those decisions.
QUESTION:

Mr. Benkard, I wanted to get your

22

position clear on one question.

Suppose Congress, instead

23

of doing what it had done in this transition period, had

24

said this particular claim, this 10b-5 claim, has a life

25

of four years.

All claims that were initially brought

2

Congress had done that, there would be no preclusion

3

doctrine operating against the plaintiff, would there?

MR. BENKARD:

If

In -- in essence, Your Honor, even

though the claim was finally dismissed before the statute

6

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. BENKARD:

9

On the then-statute of limitations.
That's correct.

We would cleave

to our position, Your Honor, that that would be a

10

violation of the separation of powers.

11

an evasion of the doctrine by the Congress simply saying,

12

we know you had a final judgment on a two-year or three-

13

year statute, now it's four years.

14

QUESTION:

It would merely be

We --

So, you're saying that Congress

15

simply cannot prolong a statute of limitations once a

16

judgment has been rendered?

17

MR. BENKARD:

18

Mr. -- Justice Kennedy, to -- to respond to your

19

question as to what is the -- in the so-called flexibility

20

cases, what -- how far can you go before interfering with

21

the courts too much?

22

the phrase "potential disruption" is used.

23

isn't -- in other words, if there is a potential

24

disruption when branch A takes something from branch B,

25

then that does not pass muster.

That is our position, Your Honor.

From the Nixon decision at least,

And if this

1

I -- I commend to Your Honors that nothing could

2

be more disruptive than the ability of the other branch to

3

take from you perhaps your most precious attribute -- and

4

that is to terminate cases.

to just as much due process protection.

And those cases are entitled

The McCullough case lives.

6

It is just as valid

7

as it was when it was decided in 1898, and it's cited

8

every day -- not every day -- it is cited constantly by

9

courts.
Your Honors, we submit that indeed -- Justice

10
11

Souter, the two doctrines do merge, although I think

12

separation of powers is there.

13

essence, it is the reason we have a due process right, as

14

well.

15

And it actually, in

And for that reason it is our submission that

16

the holding of the Fifth Circuit poses the gravest

17

possible threat to this judicial system and to the persons

18

who rely upon it every day.

urge that the decision of the Fifth Circuit be reversed.

Therefore, we respectfully
