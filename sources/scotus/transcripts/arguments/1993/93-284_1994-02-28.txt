ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL 0. TAYLOR

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TAYLOR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
My client, Security Services, is a motor common

10
11

carrier.

It filed a tariff, a tariff called 501-B,

12

submitted it to the ICC, the ICC accepted this tariff, it

13

put their stamp on it,

14

shelf, and it was there for the public to use.

15

was never rejected, it wasn't cancelled, it wasn't

16

suspended, it wasn't set aside, it was never challenged

17

until my client exercised its statutory rights under

18

section 10761(a) to collect the filed tariff rates.

"Received," they put it on their

20

QUESTION:

The tariff

Well, it was never enforced during

21

the time that the actual carrier had it, whatever its

22

validity.

23

MR. TAYLOR:

I don't agree, Mr. Chief Justice,

24

that it wasn't enforced.

The fact was that it was on file

25

and gave notice to the public as to what the rate is.

This Court in Berwind, Berwind-White Coal Mining v.

2

Chicago and Erie Railroad in 1914 said that a tariff,

3

while arguably lacking some of the formalistic

4

requirements that the act requires and that the Interstate

5

Commerce Commission might require, is enforceable if it is

6

received with no objection as to form and if it is

7

adequate to give notice to the public of the rate.
This tariff disclosed a rate, the rates were not

stated in cents per mile, but they were determinative on

It contained everything essential to rate a

QUESTION:

But both the mileage guide itself and

15

the commission regulations, as I understand it, advised

16

whoever was going to check the tariff not to look to that

17

mileage guide after a certain date, namely, the date when

18

you were no longer listed as one of the people supporting

19

that mileage guide.

Well, Justice Scalia -Would that not confuse the public at

least?

elaborate.

First of all, the ICC's claimed voiding power

2

does not come from this failure to be listed in the

3

participating carrier's tariff.

4

You just have to call it putting the
The public reading the regs and reading

the guide itself, or the things attached to the guide,
10

would believe that you were no longer using that mileage

11

guide after a certain date.
MR. TAYLOR:

12

Your Honor, what the public reads

13

is a tariff, and the tariff discloses the rate.

14

statute does not require a mileage guide, the statute

15

requires disclosure of rates, and this tariff, this 501-B

16

tariff, very plainly disclosed what the rate would be for

17

Riss.

18

QUESTION:

The

Well, if the shipper had read the

1

guide and seen the asterisk, then he would have known that

20

the rate should not be enforced --

21

MR. TAYLOR:

I don't believe that's correct.

22

What happens is, there's lots of tariffs that are allowed

23

to go into effect with defects.

it in Davis v. Portland Seed, said its defects are

25

inevitable, and if there's a certain defect, what do you

4

QUESTION:

What you look

Well, this wasn't a defect in a

5

calculation, it was a failure of a condition that must

6

continue for the rate to be valid, and that condition

7

failed.

8

9

MR. TAYLOR:

I don't agree that the rate's not

valid, Justice Kennedy.

The rate is still contained in

10

the tariff, and let us assume for the sake of argument

11

that we were not permitted to use this distance guide.

12

You still have this rate sitting out there.

15

that is abstract, a mileage is finite.

or from Baltimore to Boston.

QUESTION:

You can

You certainly cannot apply the tariff

There is only one

If that's so, why is it so

19

complicated to have all these distances that you have to

20

have a bureau do it?

21

MR. TAYLOR:

I don't think that you have to have

22

a bureau do it.

As a matter of fact, during this time

23

period, the Interstate Commerce Commission was allowing

24

all sorts of methods of filing:

1

Is it in fact true that it's very-

2

obvious -- to Washington to Baltimore, that it's very

obvious there's one and only one shortest practical route?

4

MR. TAYLOR:

That's true.

I believe that to be

true.

occasions.

I'm more familiar with the distance from

Washington, but by the -QUESTION:

11

You don't take the position that

12

there was something unreasonable beyond the statutory

13

power on the ICC to require the filing of the mileage

14

guide, do you?

15
16

MR. TAYLOR:

No.

I don't think -- I don't

think --

17

QUESTION:

Don't we then have to take tariff as

18

meaning what the ICC has construed it to mean to require

19

both the mileage rate and the mileage distance

20

specification?
MR. TAYLOR:

21

No, Justice Souter, you take the

22

tariff as to what it discloses, and this tariff disclosed

23

the rate dependent upon mileage, the charge, the

24

derivative charge, and that said we're going to use these

25

mileages.

QUESTION:

1

You had one guide, and there were

2

other guides that gave different distances between the

3

same two points, were there not?

4

could have filed a map, you could have joined this guide,

5

you could have joined another guide, and they weren't

6

uniform, were they?

7

MR. TAYLOR:

No.

There was a choice.

You

No, they weren't, Justice

8

Ginsburg.

Mileage guides were not uniform, but there was

9

only one mileage guide disclosed by my client.

We didn't

10

say, we're using all sorts of other different mileage

11

guides.

12

to the public said we would use.

There was one mileage guide that our holding out

13

QUESTION:

Well, now, what if somebody else who

14

read the ICC's rules said, I'm going to use this mileage

15

guide to start off with, but after a certain date I'm

16

going to withdraw from it, after which that will not

17

govern me.

Now, couldn't a person do that?

18

MR. TAYLOR:

19

QUESTION:

Sure, absolutely they could.
Sure.

Now, how is the public to know

20

whether you're that kind of person or whether you are your

21

kind of person --

are going to open this tariff and they are going to see

QUESTION:

These are our mileage

And this is the mileage, but the

10

reader might think well, of course, they are doing that on

11

the assumption that they are following the ICC's rules,

12

which means they only mean it for so long as they continue

13

to subscribe to the mileage guide.

14

MR. TAYLOR:

Well, Justice Scalia, the fact is

15

that during this time period, the ICC rules, the ICC had

16

issued a rule in 1984 when it amended the tariff

17

publishing regulations.

18

they eliminated from that section of the notice of

19

proposed rulemaking -- it originally said, if you refer to

20

a distance guide, you have to also provide a power of

21

attorney or concurrence in that distance guide.

22

First of all, what they did was,

1) That was deleted.

2) The ICC issued an

23

opinion called,

24

they made a complete overhaul of its rules, and it said,

due to issues of copyright and general availability, we

3

This

3 2.4(d) voiding power at least to the

extent the commission attempts to retroactively apply it

to Riss' tariff which continued in effect is something

that is basically newfound.

It's not something that any

QUESTION:• How much were the dues involved that

11

weren't paid that led to Riss not being a party to the -MR. TAYLOR:

12

The dues I believe, Justice

3

Ginsburg -- and I'm only going from my personal knowledge

4

and not from the record -- were about $83 during this time

5

period.

6

QUESTION:

Is there anything that accounts for

7

how widespread this failure to continue to be members of

8

the guide were, because I think one figure in the record

9

was that between the years

20
21

984 and

988, 40 percent of

the common carriers weren't paying their dues.
MR. TAYLOR:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

That was in

22

the record in the Jasper Wyman case, a portion of which is

23

attached to amicus Overland's brief in this case.

24

fact, during this time period, aside from 40 percent not

25

participating, there were all sorts of other methods which

commission was made aware of actual violations, they did

nothing to strike the tariffs.

6

QUESTION:

Only --

Was this because everybody was really

making deals outside the tariff?
MR. TAYLOR:

No, I don't believe so.

I believe

7

it was because the commission had basically issued this

8

decision in revision of tariffs in 1984 that said, we are

9

no longer going to require filing of distance guides, and

10
11

we are not going to require participation in them.
The commission now says, well, that means

12

copyrighting or something like that, but I think the

13

unequivocal language of that decision is -- and I can

14

quote it almost verbatim -- is due to issues of copyright

15

and general availability, we will no longer mandate for

16

distance guides their filing with the commission or

17

participation in them.

18

similar to that, so I think --

19

QUESTION:

At least, it's language very

You didn't at the time Riss -- the

20

prebankruptcy Riss didn't have a whole lot of interest in

21

adherence to this tariff, because in fact you were making

22

deals for a price lower than the tariff.

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I don't

agree with that.

these bankruptcies, I know there's a lot of these cases

2

that have developed their way up through the system, this

3

Court having had several in the last 3 years.

4

majority of the cases, the carrier bills the tariff rate.

5

The other thing in this case, it's not a matter

In the vast

6

of protecting the Riss, it's a matter of protecting the

7

public and their ability to challenge rates that are on

8

file.

9

There's no way, if -- the core purpose of the

10

act that this court said in Maislin was to disclose the

11

rate and allow people to challenge them as discriminatory

12

and also to provide stability in the rate by allowing the

13

Commission's -- the circuit court's application of the

14

Commission rule, basically what the Court would be saying

15

in that case would be that well, you can negotiate

16

whatever you want, and if your tariff is somewhat

17

defective, it doesn't meet the proper form, then, well,

18

okay, you cannot collect it.

19

QUESTION:

I understand what your argument is

20

now in collecting from customers who paid less, but

21

suppose there had been no bankruptcy, could Riss have gone

22

after the people that it gave discount rates to, or would

23

there have been some kind of estoppel working

24

prebankruptcy?

QUESTION:

All of these cases seeking more from

MR. TAYLOR:

12

Would there have been some

No, I don't believe so.

First of

13

all, the application of the filed rate doctrine has never

14

been dependent on somebody being in bankruptcy.

15

just my client's right to collect its tariff charge, it's

16

my client's duty, whether bankrupt or not bankrupt, to

17

collect the tariff charges, so by that same token the

MR. TAYLOR:

Solvent carriers bring these types

of actions not as frequently as bankrupt carriers.

Do they bring any of them?

Are there

any solvent carriers in this whole family of cases?
MR. TAYLOR:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. TAYLOR:

Recently?
Yes.
Solvent carriers -- yes, I have

12

several carriers who I represent who have brought actions

13

for undercharges.

Yes, in that setting.
Are there any undercharged suits that

MR. TAYLOR:

Not that I'm aware -- not recently.

In the past, yes, but not recently that I'm aware of.
I think what happens in a case such as this is

24

that what the Interstate Commerce Commission advocates

25

through its rules and through its newfound interpretation

1

of its regulation is that somehow that there should be a

2

punishment upon Riss for not filing this power of attorney

3

and remembering that the voiding power does not come from

4

not being listed in the tariff, the voiding power comes

5

from not providing the power of attorney.

6

But the act is there to protect the public, and

7

it's there to protect the core purpose there, being able

8

to challenge a filed rate as discriminatory, as unduly

9

preferential and perhaps unreasonable under some of the

10

other criteria in the act, and it's really the public

11

interest that's being protected.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. TAYLOR:

14

QUESTION:

Can I ask another question -Yes, Justice --- about this general category?

Are

15

there any suits brought by competitors of shippers

16

claiming they were hurt by these discriminatory rates that

17

you know of?

18

MR. TAYLOR:

19

of fact, I think part of it --

20

QUESTION:

Not in recent years.

As a matter

That's surprising, if there's this

21

strong public interest supporting the full enforcement of

22

the tariff rate.

23

MR. TAYLOR:

Well, the fact is that the

24

Interstate Commerce Commission does not reach the issue of

25

reasonableness any more.

They have not yet that I'm aware

1

of actually issued a dispositive ruling ever determining

2

whether or not a rate is reasonable or -- unreasonable.

3

They basically have adopted a hands-off

4

approach, and in my opinion it would be futile for a

5

shipper to make a challenge to a rate as unduly

6

discriminatory because the Interstate Commerce Commission

7

has allowed all sorts of rates that are discriminatory and

8

it hasn't, that I'm aware of, actually issued an order

9

finding that a rate might be discriminatory.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Taylor, I assumed -- well, under

11

one of the regs of the Commerce Commission you can file a

12

rate that has an expiration date on it, can't you?

13

MR. TAYLOR:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.
And what happens to that rate when

15

the expiration date comes?

16

effective?

17

MR. TAYLOR:

18

QUESTION:

It automatically is no longer

It goes away.
Nqw, why isn't this simply the same

19

thing?

20

file a rate that refers to this extrinsic mileage chart,

21

your rate will automatically expire at the time that --

22

it's simply telling the public that -- it's just like

23

saying, in the regs, when you say, we will round off your

24

mileage to the nearest hundred so that if you say,

25

75 miles, that shall be deemed to be 100 miles.

MR. TAYLOR:

But in this case, Justice Scalia,

4

the Riss 501-B tariff continued to be on the shelf,

5

continued to be charged to people other than K Mart, and

6

it was there for the public to view to see and to

7

challenge if they wanted to.

8

QUESTION:

Yes, but the ICC had in effect said

Riss' tariff shall be deemed to expire when Riss'
10

membership expires.

11

say that the rule was unauthorized?

12

That's what the ICC -- now, do you

MR. TAYLOR:

No, the rule is authorized.

The

13

rule is proper, but the application of the rule to have an

14

effect saying this tariff that was on the shelf since

15

1 84, we should pretend does not exist and should give no

16

legal effect to it, that is contrary to law.

17

contrary to this Court's precedent in Maislin, it runs

18

contrary to this Court's precedent in Berwind.

It runs

A part of the problem is, frankly,

lack of oversight by the Commission, for whatever reason.

22

Part of the problem is the Commission has shortened the

time period for filing tariffs.

shorten it to less than 30 days, so you can decrease a

2

to go through it and say, hey, there's something wrong

3

with your tariff.

4

That certainly doesn't give the Commission time

QUESTION:

How is determination shown?

If

5

someone looks at the guide, they just looked at the

6

mileage from X point to Y point, they wouldn't see

7

anything, but the names of the people -- how was that --

8

when Riss dropped out, when it didn't pay the $83, how was

9

notice of that conveyed to the shipping world?

10

MR. TAYLOR:

Well, it's affected through what's

11

called a participating carrier's tariff, so what you have

12

to do is, you have to start with the Riss tariff, which

13

says it's governed by the mileage guide and only by the

14

mileage guide, and then you go from the mileage guide,

15

which says this only applies for people listed in tariff

16

107, so you make a two-step removal from Riss' tariff to

17

see who's listed.

18

Then there's supplements that come out from time

19

to time that the Household Goods Tariff Bureau would

20

publish, which show through symbolization Riss's name

21

being stricken and all sorts of other carriers being

22

stricken from the tariff, but the Commission hasn't gotten

23

to the point to where they go back and cancel Riss' here.

MR. TAYLOR:

Yes, that's exactly correct.

The

3

fact is -- and I think the principal point in a case such

4

as this, however, is that what is the disclosed rate?

5

What does the statute require?

6

7

can determine mileages without having a mileage guide.

8

a matter of fact, the Commission's own regulations at 49

C.F.R. part 1048, when referring to what are called

The statute requires us to

10

commercial zones, refers to airline miles around a

11

particular city, which would require some sort of external

12

measurement, so the tariffs don't require precision.

13

it requires disclosure of rates in such a fashion that

14

would enable somebody to challenge the rates as

15

discriminatory or unreasonable.

16

What

One thing this Court cited with approval in the

17

Maislin case was the regular common carrier conference

18

case by the D.C. circuit decided in 1986.

19

the Commission had put forth a rule which basically said,

20

you can put in your tariff, or actually a group of

21

carriers had published a rule which says, you can

22

negotiate whatever you want to.

23

That was in the tariff.

In that case,

That is basically the

24

sum and substance of what was said, and it was challenged

25

by a group of carriers which said, that doesn't meet the

1

requirement for a rate in the tariff, and the D.C. Circuit

2

said, that requirement is utterly central to the act, and

3

the Commission came back and said, well, we have all these

4

other methods of determining tariff rates.

5

And what the D.C. Circuit said is that while

6

those tariffs haven't been challenged yet, what they

7

said -- and this is from page 380, 793 Fed 2d 380 -- for

8

example, under volume discount rules, competing carriers

9

cannot determine the per unit rate, but the carrier is

10

charged with knowing the volume tendered by the shipper,

11

but they do at least know how the per unit rate is

12

determined, enabling them to protest the application of a

13

different formula to a particular shipper.

14

So if for some reason some shipper took that

15

extraordinary step and went two tariffs removed from Riss'

16

tariff and was somehow confused about the mileages, at

17

least we have a disclosed rate and a method of challenging

18

that rate and perhaps challenging the application of that

19

rate for a calculation of mileages in that case.

20

And by the circuit court's opinion, by upholding

21

the retroactive effect of 1312.4(d), they basically got

22

the filed rate doctrine.

23

unreliable, and this Court has said in Berwind, said it in

repose in the tariffs that are on file.
QUESTION:

Now, when you say, retroactive, this

3

was not retroactive so that it voided the tariff before

4

the date of the supplement to the rating bureau.

5

MR. TAYLOR:

6

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice Kennedy.
So it's not -- it's retroactive only

7

in the conclusory sense that you say that the rating

8

bureau publication is irrelevant.

9

MR. TAYLOR:

That's correct.

From that date

10

forward, from the date after Riss was dropped from the

11

list of participating carriers, those shippers who relied

12

on that tariff, the 501-B tariff that Riss filed in its

13

own name, those shippers that relied on it, paid that

14

rate, at that point that tariff becomes retroactively

15

voided for them and basically leaves us with no tariff.

16

The additional application of the rule, while

17

not present in this case, but the record attached to

18

Overland's brief, the amicus brief filed by Overland in

19

this case, indicates that you can have the reverse effect.

20

In American trucking, all you had was a restoration to a

21

cheaper rate, but if you void -- if the Commission is

allowed to void carriers' rates, it may -- it doesn't in

is, upholding the disclosed rate, not allowing a

Household Goods Mileage Guide at Joint Appendix 35.

That

2

note clearly says that "This mileage guide may not be

3

employed by a carrier as a governing publication for the

4

purpose of determining transportation rates based on

5

mileage or distance unless the carrier is shown as a

6

participant in the above-named tariff."

7

Riss was once a party to that carrier -- to that

8

tariff, and so its rates were complete when they initially

9

filed the Riss 501 tariff.

That's the rate tariff.

They

10

paid their dues until 1985, when they decided to stop.

11

It's irrelevant how much the dues were, because under the

12

filed rate doctrine the carrier's name must be in every

13

tariff that it publishes.

14

In 1985, as I said, it stopped paying.

The

15

Household Goods Mileage Bureau duly cancelled Riss from

16

the tariff by filing a cancellation supplement.

QUESTION:

So you pick up the -- if you just

pick up the rate, you can pick up the mileage book and

stop there, then you don't know that Riss is no longer

6

MR. AUGELLO:

But the point is that it really is

7

irrelevant whether you pick up the tariff or not, because

8

carriers and shippers alike are charged with constructive

9

notice of every duly filed tariff, and that I think is the

10

problem that we ran into in the Overland case when the

11

Court did not duly apply that principle.

talking about, well, did the shipper really check the

13

tariff, did the shipper really check to see if the power

QUESTION:

They were

It's irrelevant.

Mr. Augello, Mr. Taylor has told us

that by 1985, when this tariff as you put it no longer

by that time, the Commission by decision had eliminated

the requirement that you be a participant.

That the Commission

6

What the Commission was saying is, we're not

going to mandate that any publisher of a mileage guide

must file their tariff with the Commission because of

copyright problems, and the Commission went on to say the

Commission meant simply that because of the pending

11

copyright litigation involving the right to author a

filing a mileage guide with the Commission nor deny any

And as I said earlier, Riss originally was a

QUESTION:

If we can go back to my question, I

11

think your answer was that the percentage was in fact a

12

lot lower, but 111 is still a significant number dealing

13

with a rule of the Commission that says one must have a

14

filed rate, and to have this rate complete we need two

parts, the rate and the distance.

That's right, but the shippers who

were in good faith negotiating these rates with carriers,

12

MR. MANNING:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Under the Commission's longstanding and

3

consistent interpretation of the Interstate Commerce Act,

4

if a carrier wishes to meet its filed rate obligation by

5

referring to someone else's tariff, he must participate in

6

a continuing agency relationship with that other entity.

7

That interpretation, which goes back more than

8

50 years, is currently reflected in the Commission's void

9

for nonparticipation rule, which provides that if a

20

carrier allows its participation in an agency tariff to

21

lapse, the tariff becomes void as a matter of law as to

22

that carrier.

23

QUESTION:

What's the reason for that

24

nonparticipation rule, Mr. Manning?

Is it really just to

25

enable the person who files the other tariff to be able to

2

collect $83, or is there some other reason for it?
MR. MANNING:

Well, as the ICC indicated in its

3

Wonderoast decision, which is cited in our brief and which

4

appears in 8 I.C.C. 2nd, that doctrine is an

5

interpretation of the statutory requirement that appears

6

in two sections.

7

In section 10702 of title 49, it provides that

8

the carrier shall establish the rates for its

9

transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the

10

Interstate Commerce Commission under the relevant

11

subchapter, and section 10762 of title 49 provides that

12

the carrier shall file a tariff containing those rates,

13

and so in effect the ICC has interpreted the statute in a

14

way that places the responsibility on the carrier to set

15

its own rates.

16

Now, the practical reason, I think, for the

17

policy is that these tariffs are very complicated and

18

expensive to put together, and a lot of tariffs are put

19

together by so-called rate bureaus which compile this

20

information and set up the system of rules and practices

21

and so forth that govern the transportation subject to the

22

jurisdiction of the act, and if there were not a

23

participation requirement in the ICC's rules, then

24

everyone would literally free ride on these agency tariffs

25

simply by filing a tariff that referred to the agency

2

tariff.
That's why the ICC's rules are quite explicit in

3

saying that when a carrier who is a party to a tariff,

4

that includes its own tariff,

5

and when its rates are governed by that separate tariff,

6

it must be a participant in that separate tariff as well,

7

and that requirement is contained in section 1312.27(e),

8

and I just want to pause for a moment and address

9

petitioner's claim that the decision in this case is

and

refers to a separate tariff,

10

actually inconsistent with the ICC's regulations, when in

11

fact it is not.

12

The HGB Mileage Guide,

the tariff from which

13

petitioners -- I'm sorry,

14

was cancelled,

15

section 1312.30, which is in on pages 9a and 10a of the

16

appendix to our brief,

17

provides that except as provided in the specified

subsection, which refers to Government publications, only

19

distance guides officially on file with the Commission may

20

be referred to.

it says

1

to -- in tariffs which refer to and are governed by-

2

separate tariffs, they shall also participate in those

3

governing separate tariffs, and that means that when a

4

carrier refers to a mileage guide, and when its rates are

5

governed by that mileage guide, it must also participate

6

in that mileage guide.

7

Now, there's one other provision I want to refer

8

you to, and that's the heart of this case, and that's

9

1312.4(d), which is cited on page 3a of our appendix, and

10

that provision says that a carrier -- and this -- I'm

11

starting at the third line down, after the word "however,"

12

a carrier may not participate in a tariff issued in the

13

name of another carrier or an agent unless a power of

14

attorney or concurrence has been executed.

15

effective concurrences, or powers of attorney, tariffs are

16

void as a matter of law.

Absent

17

Now, we believe and the Commission has so held

18

in the Jasper Wyman decision as well as other decisions,

19

that if you read those three provisions together, they

20

require the conclusion that a carrier must participate,

21

must maintain an agency relationship with the publishers

22

of a mileage guide in order to be able to refer to that

23

mileage guide as part of its filed rate.

24
25

Now, Riss did not do that in this case, as
petitioners concede, and for that reason, although Riss

the filed rate and the filed rate doctrine are central to

industry, and the ICC does -- has in recent years taken an

aggressive stance in enforcing the requirement of

participations.

11

Commission, the Commission entered 24 consent decrees with

12

carriers who had let their participations in mileage

13

guides and other tariffs lapse, and had sought and

14

obtained one injunction, and the proceeding that

15

Mr. Augello referred to, which is in 9 I.C.C. 2nd., was a

proceeding in which HGB came to -- the Household Goods

Carriers Bureau came to the ICC and said, we are aware

18

that this certain number of carriers have not participated

19

in our mileage guide but are referring to it, and the ICC

that a lot of the problems that have arisen in this case

Whatever

remedial action the Commission may take in the future

concerning the enforcement of the filed rate, the fact

remains that in this case there was no filed rate, and in

This is, as the Chief Justice pointed out,

10

precisely the same thing as if the carrier's own tariff

11

had expired or been cancelled.
The Commission's consistent view has been that

12

13

if a carrier cancels its own tariff, even if it's

14

accidental, that cancellation is effective without the

15

Commission's taking any form of action to validate or

That cancellation was duly published in a tariff

filed by HGB pursuant to Commission rules.

22

Commission rules, and that's specifically rule 1312.10(a),

if a power of attorney is cancelled, if a participation is

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Mr. Taylor,

MR. TAYLOR:

Thank you, Your Honor.

6

The voiding power that the Commission claims

7

doesn't come from failure to be listed in the tariff, it

8

comes from the failure to provide a private power of

9

attorney, failure to provide it to the publisher of the

10

distance guide, and the Commissioner has said those

11

documents are no longer used by us.

12

That's where the voiding power comes from, so at

13

the time -- now, they say, well, it only comes -- the

if they are void as a matter of law, there really is no

You can manipulate

that.

that would be illegal, but a mile is something that's

finite.

There's all sorts of things that you can manipulate

14

This Court said, in a case called Hewitt Robbins

v. Eastern Freightways in 1962, that a shipper is entitled

to receive the rate over the cheapest route available.

There's nothing that says tariffs have to be perfect.

we can't use the mileage guide, if you determine somehow

that this reference was illegal, you still have this
