ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID S. JONAS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. JONAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In the Marine Corps we have a bedrock principle;

14

the unit sets the pace.

15

Marines, then they may not like that, but they understand

16

the importance of that principle and so they put up with

17

it.

18

So when a unit, a

If there's faster and stronger

Similarly, this Court has in the Miranda v.

19

Arizona case set a bedrock principle too, the Fifth

20

Amendment right to counsel.

21

suggest to this Court that in considering the standard to

22

set for the invocation of that right, that you consider

23

the stragglers in society like petitioner in this case:

24

the weak, the timid, the uneducated, and those who have

25

never before been exposed to the perils and the pressures

And I would respectfully

There's essentially a universe of comments that

But then we get to the subject of this case, the

12

statement which is ambiguous, an ambiguous request for

13

counsel, which is the issue granted in this case.

QUESTION:

there a - - he was read his Miranda rights at the outset?

MR. JONAS:

QUESTION:

20

MR. JONAS:

22

QUESTION:

24
25

Yes, Justice O'Connor, he was.
And waived them.
Yes, that's correct.
So there had been an unequivocal

waiver initially.

21

23

Well, now, just to set the scene, was

That's correct.

That's correct.

And so we are looking at this

statement in that context and setting.
MR. JONAS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

But I'm

not aware of any authority which indicates that once a

1

suspect has waived his rights, that it is more difficult

2

for him to subsequently then invoke them.
QUESTION:

3

So --

No, but it may have some bearing on

4

whether it's appropriate to inquire about the meaning of

5

an ambiguous statement made later.

6

bearing on the resolution of this case, perhaps.

7

MR. JONAS:

I think it has a

Well, I would respectfully disagree,

8

because I don't see how it's -- how once a suspect waives

9

his right, that it's more difficult for him to invoke.

At

10

any rate, the issue in this case is an ambiguous request.

11

And I just want to be very clear about the terms, because

12

ambiguity is a fog that is very difficult to pierce.

13

if you'll note, in the issue granted by this Court the

14

subject was an ambiguous request for counsel, and yet the

15

Government has consistently referred to it as an ambiguous

16

comment or an ambiguous statement, and an offhanded

17

remark, that type of thing.

18

QUESTION:

And what --

It loads it to call it an ambiguous

19

request for counsel.

20

you're saying it was a request for counsel that was

21

ambiguous.

22

the whole problem.

23
24
25

I mean it was a request for --

Maybe it wasn't a request for counsel.

MR. JONAS:

And

That's

Well, that's the problem with

ambiguity.
QUESTION:

Isn't it more accurate to call it a

MR. JONAS:

QUESTION:

It might have been a

Well, we -So, I mean, if you want to be

6

picky-picky about words, it seems to me the Government's

7

more accurate than you are.

8

9

MR. JONAS:

Well, I think that our standard,

which says that when a -- that you have an invocation when

10

a suspect in custodial interrogation makes a statement

11

which could reasonably be construed in context as a

12

request for counsel, then it becomes an invocation.

13

That's the easy thing about our standard; it requires one

14

question, what --

15

QUESTION:

Yes, but the Court hasn't adopted

16

your standard, and I thought you were talking about, you

17

know, what is the question we're presented with.

18

question we're presented is whether this particular

19

statement is or is not a request for counsel.

20

MR. JONAS:

The

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

21

And that is to be determined in context, and if we look at

22

the context here we've got a young military man.

23

young sailor, an extremely low ranking sailor.

He's a
He's

road, the higher the discipline in the unit.

3

It's -- he's in an authoritarian setting, and

4

what happened was he was --he was in the psychiatric ward

5

for over a week when he was arrested by the Naval

6

Investigative Service agents and taken to their

headquarters.

8

and the interrogation begun -- began.

O'Connor noted, he, in fact, did initially waive his

rights, and the interrogation proceeded.
However, what happened was -- you have to

realize what this young man was -- the situation that had

13

occurred.

14

why he was in the psychiatric ward for a week.

15

Colorado v. Connelly, a suspect's mental condition is a

relevant issue to be considered in terms of the

voluntariness calculus, which has to be addressed here.

In the interrogation the questions got more and

more difficult when they finally confronted him with a

MR. JONAS:

But the fact of the matter is that

10

in the military it's different, and if a military member

11

does any of those things, he'll have "United States V" in

front of his name.

He

pursued the question of whether, indeed, he did want a

lawyer, and he said,

3

I don't see how the person has been put upon.

4

MR. JONAS:

"no, I don't; I'll go ahead anyway."

If the Fifth Amendment right to

weak and the timid, it's not -- people don't speak in

imperatives.

construed in Miranda v. Arizona.

10

People don't -- no one is going to say, I

talk.
QUESTION:

11

But when you -- when you make an

ambiguous statement and then the person says, do you want

It's impossible to assume that everybody does

You can't

Well, Justice Scalia, I'll agree

19

that a suspect has to try -- just like in a march, the

20

Marine can't take his pack off and sit down, he has to

21

try, he has to do a little bit.

22

people, in context, would understand "maybe I want to talk

23

to a lawyer" as an invocation of his right to counsel.

24

That's obviously what he's thinking.

right after the Miranda warnings themself.

QUESTION:

Well, do you concede, counsel, that

at any point interrogators have an obligation to clarify

what the suspect has said, to determine whether or not

what he has said indicates the desire for a lawyer?
MR. JONAS:

Absolutely not, Justice Kennedy.

think that - QUESTION:

So there's no matter of degree here.

There either is an invocation of the right to counsel -10

In other words, there's no universe

of ambiguous statements that could ever require

1

Under Miranda, when a suspect indicates in any manner and

2

at any stage of the proceeding that he wants to invoke his

3

right to counsel, that's it.

4

this Court has set a low threshold for invocation in North

5

Carolina v. Butler, and it has set a low standard for

6

reinitiation in Oregon v. Bradshaw, where all a suspect

7

had to say is, hey, what's going to happen to me now, and

8

all of a sudden he's reinitiated the interrogation.

9

All we're saying is that it should be the

It's a low threshold, and

10

same -- if it's a swinging door, right now a suspect has

11

to push hard to get in to invoke the right to counsel,

12

whereas to waive it, he has to touch the door and the door

13

goes flying open and he goes out.

14

the same amount of pressure to be applied to that swinging

15

door to get in and to get out.

16

QUESTION:

17
18

All we're asking for is

So --

May I ask -- I'm sorry, were you

going to ask him?
May I ask you this?

Your argument I think has

19

two strains in it.

20

ambiguous statement or this allegedly ambiguous statement

21

is, in fact, an invocation of the right to counsel.

22

second strain of your argument is when confronted with a

23

question like this, the interrogators ought to do one

24

thing or the other; i.e. they ought either to treat it as

25

an invocation of counsel, or they ought to ask further

One strain of the argument is this

(800) FOR DEPO

The

1

questions to decide whether it is.

And your argument is

2

that it's the former of those alternatives.

3

My question is this; in order to agree with you

4

that they should treat the statement as an invocation and

5

not question the suspect about what he means, we don't

6

have to agree with you about your - - on your first point

7

that this statement before us, which is called ambiguous,

8

in fact really isn't ambiguous at all, that it's really an

9

invocation.
In other words, we can --we can say, no, you're

10
11

wrong, this is a truly ambiguous statement, we don't know

12

what it means, and even in context we're not sure, and yet

13

consistently we could say confronted with that kind of a

14

question or that kind of a statement, they either ought to

15

stop or they should stop and call a lawyer.

16

MR. JONAS:

Well, Justice Souter, the problem is

17

an individual who mentions --he can only mean three

18

things:

19

don't know.

20

reflect equivocation, but in this situation "maybe" is on

21

its face ambiguous, and there's no question about it.

22

But, of course, I mean in Smith v. --

23

I want a lawyer, I don't want a lawyer, or I
In a perfect world, ambiguity would always

QUESTION:

So why don't you -- why don't you

24

forget the argument that the ambiguous statement is really

25

an invocation of counsel, and simply go to the question of

1

what the Government ought to do when it's confronted with

2

an ambiguous statement.

3

Government ought to treat it as if it were an invocation.

And your argument there is the

4

MR. JONAS:

That's correct.

5

QUESTION:

And call a lawyer.

6

MR. JONAS:

That's correct.

7

QUESTION:

8

So we don't have to agree with you on

kind of the true meaning of the statement.

All we have to

agree with you, for you to win, is what should you do when
10
11

you don't know what the statement means.
MR. JONAS:

Well, but if -- if they -- there's a

12

lot of statements that they can know what it means which

13

aren't invocations, and that's where the context becomes

14

critical, as in this case.

15

look how the agents reacted to the statement "I think I

16

want the lawyer," the functional equivalent of "maybe I

17

want a lawyer," unless there's some metaphysical

18

difference of which I'm unaware, which was -- which

1

terminated the interrogation.

20

QUESTION:

So our point is that -- and

There's a big difference.

I don't

21

think it's metaphysical at all.

22

statement "maybe it will rain tomorrow" is ambiguous?

23

MR. JONAS:

QUESTION:

25

Do you think the

Any -- any statement -Is that -- "maybe it will rain

tomorrow," do you think that's ambiguous?

I don't think

1

it's ambiguous at all.
MR. JONAS:

2

3

I think it has some ambiguity on its

face, yes.

4

QUESTION:

Well, I think it's a clear

5

unambiguous statement that there is a possibility it will

6

rain tomorrow.

7

MR. JONAS:

Well, if a suspect says, "I don't

8

know if I want a lawyer," that's a genuine statement of

9

indecision, clear statement of indecision, and I'll agree

10

with you there, there are those -- such statements.
QUESTION:

11

Of decision.

But there's a

12

difference between indecision and ambiguity.

13

me if he says maybe I want a lawyer, it's -- I don't see

14

any ambiguity about the statement.

15

whether he wants a lawyer or not.

16

MR. JONAS:

It seems to

He doesn't know

But we believe that he has decided

17

he wants one, but is not expressing it clearly or in an

18

imperative manner.

19

that if you don't have an unequivocal request, it can be

20

clarified.

22

Out point is - QUESTION:

21

The court of military appeals says

What if he says,

"I don't know if I

want a lawyer," the example you just gave, what then?

23

MR. JONAS:

Again, Justice Ginsburg, we look to

24

context.

25

themself, when essentially the interrogation itself hadn't

If it was immediately after the Miranda warnings

1

proceeded or hadn't begun, at that point we would say that

2

really what he's -- what's going on there is he's -- his

3

Fifth Amendment right to silence is what comes into play,

4

which doesn't have to be invoked, which already exists.

5

So at that point the Government could not show a knowing

6

and intelligent waiver of his right to silence in order to

7

proceed, so they should stop interrogation.
However, given the facts of this case, if

8

petitioner had said at that moment when they're saying,
10

hey, we found a bloody t-shirt on it -- with the victim's

11

blood on it, and he says,

12

lawyer," that sounds like an invocation to me because it's

13

obvious what he's trying to do; he's making the

14

connection - -

QUESTION:

"I don't know if I want a

Well, I don't agree with you at all

16

on that.

17

on earth not interpret it just the way every ordinary

18

English-speaking person would; I don't know if I want a

To say,

notes.

And so all we have is a paraphrase.
But the point is the first thing they said is,

15

hey, we're not here to violate your rights, which

16

clarifies nothing.

really true, that they're -- since they're there to

18

procure a confession, they may be there to help him

be reasonable if this Court were to adopt a clarification

But if

1

clarification had to be used, this went beyond it.
Also, the military judge in this case found

2

3

specifically that the statement - - the mention of a lawyer

4

was not in the form of an invocation, and under North

5

Carolina v. Butler this Court held that waiver is not a

question of form at all.

The thing that puzzles me -- maybe --

11

I don't want to labor this, but apparently the witnesses

12

could recall the precise words that he used, but nobody

clarification, and they could make a lot of difference, as

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD H. SEAMON

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13
14

MR. SEAMON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

15

It is the United States' position that the

16

police may ask clarifying questions when a suspect in

17

custody makes an ambiguous reference to counsel.

18

clarification approach has been adopted by a majority of

19

the Federal circuits and numerous State courts, and we

20

urge this Court to adopt it because it comports with the

21

balance of competing interests underlying the Miranda and

22

Edwards rules.

On the one side --

23

24

1

suggested?
MR. SEAMON:

2

No.

A tone of voice, as much as

3

the contents of what a police officer says, can tend to

4

influence a suspect either way, and so our position is

5

that the police have to - - police officers have to be

6

neutral both in terms of what they say and how they say

7

it.

8

9
10

QUESTION:

So the clarification cannot suggest

one course of action rather than the other.
MR. SEAMON:

That's correct.

The police are

11

limited to ascertaining what the suspect's wishes are, and

12

they're not permitted to try to dissuade the suspect from

13

making the choice of getting a lawyer.

14

QUESTION:

Would you accept a general rule that

15

the police may simply - - or the interrogators may simply

16

ask one question at that point,

17

MR. SEAMON:

"Do you want a lawyer?"

No, we wouldn't go so far.

We

18

don't believe that the approach that this Court adopts

19

should attempt to script precisely what the police are

20

entitled to say in response to an ambiguous reference.

21

22

23

QUESTION:

We scripted Miranda pretty

thoroughly.
MR. SEAMON:

That's --we suggest against that

24

approach in this context.

We suggest, instead, that there

25

really be two ground rules, if you like.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(800) FOR DEPO

One is that the

1

police, in response to an ambiguous reference that can be

2

construed as a request, can't continue questioning the

3

suspect about the offense under investigation.

4

secondly, they have to remain limited to trying to

5

ascertain the suspect's wishes, rather than trying to

6

influence his choice.

7

And

And the reason we recommend against scripting

8

the approach and trying to inform exactly what they must

9

say, is that ambiguous references can take a lot of

10

different forms.

11

the lower court cases cited in the briefs, suspects have

12

posed questions to the police such as,

13

need a lawyer?"

14

it would be permissible for the police officer to say,

15

"That's your decision to make," before posing the

16

question,

17

In some cases -- for example, in some of

"Do you think I

Now, in a case like that, we think that

"Do you want a lawyer?"
There has to be that degree of flexibility

18

because sometimes the suspect's ambiguous reference

19

indicates that he needs more information about the nature

20

of his rights or a better explanation.

21

improper is a case such as Mueller v. Virginia, which is

22

the case in which this Court denied cert but Justice White

23

wrote a dissenting statement.

What we think is

24

In that case the suspect said,

25

MR. SEAMON:

1

The Court may choose to adopt an

approach that was the same for State prosecutions.

obviously, this is one of the difficulties of

understanding exactly the significance of section 3501.

It --

But now you're getting involved in a

9

arguing today.
MR. SEAMON:

10

That's correct.

In any event, it

11

doesn't apply in this case, and we would suggest that

12

apart from the question of section 3501, we're arguing

13

here that merely a reading of the Miranda line of

14

decisions leads to the conclusion that the clarification

15

approach is the one that should be adopted.

interest.
Petitioner's approach, in contrast, would skew

3

the balance underlying Miranda.

Petitioner's approach

4

requires the police to stop questioning a suspect when the

5

suspect makes any reference to a lawyer that could

6

reasonably be construed as a request for a lawyer.

7

The problem with this approach is that not every

8

ambiguous reference to a lawyer is, in fact, a request for

9

a lawyer, even if it can reasonably be construed as such.

10

Suppose, for example, in response to the Miranda warnings

11

the suspect asks this question:

12

even though I can't afford one?"

13

"Can I get a lawyer now

Now, this might be a request for counsel, and in

14

some cases presumably it will be, but in other cases it

15

will simply be a request for more information.

16

that in that situation nothing in Miranda, much less the

17

Constitution, requires the police to assume that the

18

reference is a request for an attorney simply because it

19

might be a request for an attorney.

QUESTION:

How do we find -- define those

statements that require clarification?
MR. SEAMON:

The statements that require

clarifications are those which can reasonably be construed

7

as a request for an attorney.

8

references to an attorney will indicate indecision on the

9

part of the suspect about whether he wants an attorney or

Alternatively, some

10

not, and in those situations too, we think that

11

clarification is appropriate.

12

Actually, the statement that was made in this

case is a good example of a statement that is both

ambiguous and you might also say ambivalent.

9

in fact, he's asking for an attorney or not or whether

To us it makes no

10

it's ambiguous enough, when clarification will take care

11

of many of these cases.

12

We think it's unreasonable to assume that once a

3

suspect makes an ambiguous reference to an attorney,

4

actually wants an attorney, he'll suddenly change his mind

in response to neutral clarifying questions.

think that suspects' wills will be overborne that simply.

MR. SEAMON:

QUESTION:

8

MR. SEAMON:

9

An equivocal one indicating that the

That's correct, and --- He or she wants a lawyer.
That's correct, and the statement

in this case is an example, to my mind, of a statement

10

that is both ambiguous and equivocal.

The statement,

11

"maybe I should get a lawyer," could be construed to

12

indicate indecision, and in that case -- and as a

3

practical matter, it is often difficult to distinguish

4

between ambiguous and equivocal assertions of counsel.

5

And as a legal matter, under Miranda the Government has

6

the burden of proving that a suspect has clearly waived

7

his right to counsel before they can continue questioning,

8

so if -- if the suspect makes it clear that he is

9

undecided on that point, questioning has to stop until he

20
21

makes a clear and unequivocal waiver.
Ultimately, petitioner bases his approach on two

22

arguments, and we think that both are irreconcilable with

23

the whole Miranda line of cases.

24

simply that the police cannot be trusted to limit

25

themselves to neutral clarifying questions in response to

The first argument is

1

an ambiguous reference.

2

out, it could also be argued that the police can't be

3

trusted to give the Miranda warnings in the first place,

4

at least and tell the truth about it on the stand.

5

But as Justice Scalia pointed

And, in fact, such an argument was made in the

6

dissent in Miranda by Justice Harlan, and we think the

7

answer to both Justice Harlan's argument and petitioner's

8

is the same, that the clarification approach doesn't

9

depend on trusting the police to do the right thing in

10

every case, any more than does the Miranda line of cases.

11

They do depend, and reasonably so, on the ability of

12

courts to enforce the rules when the police do not observe

3
4

them.
The second argument that petitioner makes is a

5

related one, which is that even neutral clarifying

6

questions will somehow exert a coercive influence.

7

QUESTION:

Yeah, but if you had just a stop

8

rule, if you had the rule that petitioner is urging, then

9

you wouldn't have to worry about the police officers'

20
21

credibility.
MR. SEAMON:

There would still be credibility

22

issues about what the suspect said in certain cases, about

23

whether what the suspect said was clear or ambiguous.

24
25

QUESTION:

Yes, you wouldn't eliminate that

ambiguity, but you certainly would insulate the defendant

1

against a statement of the type Justice Souter suggested.

2

I mean,

3

"You really want a LAWYER!?"
MR. SEAMON:

That's correct, but we don't think

4

that the additional fact-finding that courts are required

5

to engage in under the clarification approach is that much

6

different and that much more complicated than determining

7

what the suspect said, as opposed to determining what the

8

police said in response.

9

And, obvious -- there is an obvious cost

10

associated with petitioner's approach, and we think it is

11

a significant one, which is that in many cases the police

12

will be required to stop questioning a suspect who hasn't

3

actually made a decision that he wants to have counsel

4

present during the questioning, and we think that Miranda

5

entitles the police to continue questioning in those cases

6

until the suspect has actually invoked his right.

7

The other argument I was referring to is that

8

somehow neutral clarifying questions exert a coercive

9

influence, and this argument too is similar to an argument

20

that was made in the dissent in Miranda, this time by

21

Justice White.

22

inherently -- if the custodial setting is inherently

23

coercive, how can we trust a suspect to give an uncoerced

24

response to the simple question of whether he wants a

25

lawyer or not.

He argued that if the coercive setting is

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

And, again, the answer to both Justice White's

1

2

argument and petitioner's is essentially the same, that

3

Miranda is premised on the assumption that once the

4

Miranda warnings are given, they dispel the coercive

5

forces that are inherent in the custodial setting and

6

enable the suspect to make a knowing and voluntary and

7

intelligence choice about whether to exercise his rights.

8

That assumption doesn't drop out of the picture just

9

because a suspect makes an ambiguous reference to counsel.
If you accept the premise of Miranda, once the

10
11

warnings are given any inherent coercive pressures are

12

dispelled.

13

questioning may exert a force of their own that prompts

14

the suspect to attempt to invoke the right to counsel, but

15

here again it's unreasonable to believe that the suspect

16

in that case will suddenly change his mind in response to

17

a few neutral clarifying questions.

18

he's in trouble and that feeling leads him to ask for a

19

lawyer in an unsuccessful way, then it's unreasonable to

20

believe that he's going to lose that incentive in response

21

to a few neutral questions.

If the suspect thinks

that at that point it's sort of worn off.

says a request can indicate that a suspect is incapable of

7

dealing with the pressure of custodial interrogation, and

that's why we believe that an ambiguous request indicates

that a suspect is even less capable of dealing with those

First, we believe that Miranda can dispel the

I'd like to just address some of the issues that

12

arose also.

13

14

information, certainly not invocations, and in that case

15

you would have the interrogator, who is the powerful one,

16

clarifying information for the powerless suspect.

17

that's okay.

18

It's only where the powerful interrogator is making the

19

suspect clarify his desires that there's a problem.

20

under Arizona v. Roberson, we believe that the suspect's

21

viewpoint, in this case a timid suspect, should be

22

considered.

23

The question of "can I get a lawyer" or "do

There's absolutely no problem with that.

The Government also says that clarification will

cost the Government confessions, and I think that what

25

that does is acknowledge that without clarification

they're going to lose confessions, because if the suspect

2

is confronted with the additional coercion of a

clarification scenario, he may very well back off of his

initial invocation.

QUESTION:

Well, it could mean, Mr. Jonas, that

6

in some cases clarification will make clear it is a

request for counsel, in other cases it will make clear

8

that it wasn't a request for counsel, and in the latter

kind of class of cases, the police were entitled to

10

continue to interrogate but didn't do so.
MR. JONAS:

11

That's true, Mr. Chief Justice, but

12

the Government also points out their problem with foisting

13

a lawyer on the suspect.

14

that's going to come in and handcuff the suspect to a

chair.

So we don't see a danger with ceasing question

QUESTION:

Well, there may not be a danger, as

22

you see it, but don't you agree that the Government is

23

right; out of the class of cases of ambiguous requests

that are clarified, some would turn out to be not requests

and some yes requests.

opportunity to question.

MR. JONAS:

Well, again, it's very difficult to

comment without understanding what the context was for the

Yeah, but you're not claiming that

No, but could you answer that

I mean some ambiguous statements are requests

MR. JONAS:

Well, using that specific

terminology, ambiguous request, ambiguous requests are

requests for counsel under Miranda in any manner.

MR. JONAS:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, I do.
Okay.

Well, the Government's point,

3

I think, simply is that if you require an automatic

cessation of questioning, in those cases which are not

had.

MR. JONAS:

9

Isn't -- isn't that all the Government is saying?
Well, but, Justice Souter, I think

what -- in Miranda the language of the agent's using his

10

judgment does not refer, in our opinion, to clarification.

11

Rather, it refers to simply using the judgment, was it an

12

invocation or not?

3

If it's an invocation, questioning

must cease, and the Edwards bright line rule kicks in.

Well, that's another possibility.

Do you - - you make the argument that

8

there could be clarification, that there was more than

clarification in this case?

10

Do you argue in the alternative that assuming

MR. JONAS:

Absolutely, Justice Stevens.

And by

11

saying what they did, making a gratuitous comment such as,

12

"we're not here to violate your rights," they went beyond

13

the neutral bounds of what proper clarification should be.

14

And under Zerbst, we feel that -- under Zerbst this Court

15

held that every - - that the Court should indulge every

16

reasonable presumption against waiver.

17

arguing for in the invocation sense is the converse of

18

that rule, that courts should be told to adopt every

19

reasonable presumption in favor of invocation, and that's

20

really all our standard does.

And what we're

Under Connecticut v. Barrett this Court held --

Wouldn't your argument there be a lot

But here we're dealing with a

So I guess once -- I'm saying that

once the suspect has unambiguously satisfied the Zerbst

standard, I'm not sure what force your argument has that

11

we should sort of reindulge the Zerbst presumption in this

converse sense and say any ambiguous statement should be

an invocation.

MR. JONAS:

Because, again, of Miranda --
