ORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER De ANGELIS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. De ANGELIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
My client, Harold E. Staples, was convicted of

12

knowing possession of a machinegun not registered to him,

13

in violation of 26 U.S.C. section 5861(d).

14

asking this Court to reverse this conviction and remand

15

this case for a new trial, a fair trial.

16

My client is

The defendant respectfully contends that the

17

first trial was not fair.

18

jury was prohibited by the jury instructions presented to

19

consider whether or not Mr. Staples knew the sport rifle

20

he possessed was, in fact, a machinegun.

21

It was not fair because the

As stated by Justice Ebel in his concurring

22

opinion, printed at page 24A of the Petition for Cert in

23

this case, whether the appellant in this case is an

24

innocent victim is an open question because the jury was

25

precluded from considering his knowledge of the gun's

that we let the jury decide whether the defendant

3

possessed an automatic weapon.

4

Principles of justice and fair play suggest

Prior to this criminal prosecution, the citizen

before this Court had no prior criminal record, was

engaged in no unlawful activity, certainly engaged in no

unlawful activity in connection with this gun.

Certainly, he did not.

prosecution.
QUESTION:

Oh, I'm sorry.

I misunder -- I

misunderstood you.
MS. De ANGELIS:

Mr. Staples believed what he

17

possessed -- possessed what he believed to be -- and the

18

undisputed evidence, testimony of three other witnesses at

1

trial, was that this legal semiautomatic weapon, operated

20

only in semiautomatic mode prior to government seizure and

1

apparently one you're going to make here, that we have

2

before us this issue of whether the defendant actually

3

knew it was automatic.

4

was a machinegun, and the court of appeals did not

5

overturn that finding.

I thought the jury found that it

MS. De ANGELIS:

6

Justice O'Connor, I would

7

disagree to the extent that the jury was precluded from

8

considering whether or not the weapon was a machinegun.

9

Because of the nature of the instruction, all the jury had

10

to find was that the defendant possessed a device that was

11

dangerous, and that dangerous device was likely to be

12

subject to regulation.
QUESTION:

13

That's not the same as --

Well, I thought the jury had to find

14

that it was a machinegun.

15

your client knew of its capability.

MS. De ANGELIS:

17

They didn't have to find that

They had to find it was a

firearm, and technically -QUESTION:

18

And the firearm was defined in this

19

instance, under this statute, as something that fires

automatically with a single pull of the trigger.

O'Connor.

That's correct, Justice

There are -QUESTION:

And that was the finding and the

24

court of appeals did not upset that.

So we -- we take

MS. De ANGELIS:

1

When the trigger was pulled on

2

this gun, the weapon fired multiple shots with a single

3

trigger pull.

4

that constitutes a machinegun, then I would have to agree

5

with your analysis of the Tenth Circuit opinion.

If what you're saying, Justice O'Connor, is

6

However, how --

7

QUESTION:

And if it were shown that this

8

defendant knew of -- of that capability, of that

9

operational feature, then there wouldn't be really a case

10

here.

11

MS. De ANGELIS:

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. De ANGELIS:

That's correct.

All right.
There are approximately 70

14

million law abiding gun owners in this country who

15

Congress has consistently sought to protect.

16

protection of hunters and sportsmen is codified in section

17

101 of the Gun Control Act, cited in our brief at page 39.

18

Of the 70 million law abiding gun owners, a large

19

percentage of them own semiautomatic guns purchased

20

lawfully, just like Mr. Staples, at a public gun show

21

authorized by 18 U.S.C. 923, subsection (j).

22

The

In the record, and throughout the case law,

23

there are cited numerous instances where truly innocent

24

possessors of semiautomatic rifles may be convicted of

25

knowing possession of a machinegun.

For example, at trial

of this case, Judge Cook expressly, repeatedly showed

2

concern about people who may be out duck hunting and their

3

sport rifle may double by accident, without any prior

indication that it had such capability, and that doubling

QUESTION:

1

When you talk about fair play,

2

counsel, you're not suggesting that if this statute, in

3

fact, said all you have to know is that you have a gun and

4

the gun, in fact, has to be of a certain type -- that

5

that's what this statute said, that's fair play?
MS.. De ANGELIS:

6
7

I'm understanding your question.
QUESTION:

8
9

Justice Ginsburg, I'm not sure

I was thinking what you said --

you're interpreting a statute and you say -- said that the

10

statute requires that the defendant know he possessed a

11

machinegun.

12

the statute, that's what it says.

Suppose -- so -- and you're --as you read

13

MS. De ANGELIS:

14

QUESTION:

That's correct.

If the statute, in fact, said

15

defendant must know he has a gun, the gun must be a

16

machinegun, period, that that would be fair play, that you

17

wouldn't -- you're not raising a constitutional point.
MS. De ANGELIS:

18

No.

And also I would direct --

19

Justice Ginsburg, as you well know, in the U.S. v. Harris

20

decision decided by the D.C. Circuit which you authored,

21

there is no constitutional requirement -QUESTION:

22

I don't believe I authored that

decision.

MS. De ANGELIS:

That's correct.

As well, that

there is no constitutional requirement to apply a scienter

element into the criminal offenses.

courts have done in recent history is they have used tools

of statutory construction, and the rule of lenity, to find

there is an ambiguous statute, then principles of

widespread lawful gun ownership, wished to criminalize the

Do they say knowing that it -- knowing that it is
Do those statutes say that?
MS. De ANGELIS:

3

No.

Those are, for the most

4

part -- and I must tell you I'm not familiar with every

5

single one of the controlled substances statutes, but they

6

would -- most of them do require strict liability.

7

However, the difference between a controlled narcotic or

8

sulfuric acid or other substances of that nature, is it

There is a

Second -- Second Amendment right to bear arms, and for

11

be registered intact and what firearms may be legally

"In

cases in which the offense involves regulation of an item

that would not ordinarily be considered a hazard to the

12

community, a rigorously knowledge element may be implied."

13

The rationale that all parties agree for the implication

14

of a knowledge requirement is that any other result would

15

risk criminalizing a broad range of innocent conduct, just

16

as we were discussing earlier in the Liparota decision.

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

It's our position that the jury was properly

14

instructed in this case, and that petitioner's conviction,

15

accordingly, should be affirmed.

16

that in order to convict petitioner, it had to find that

17

he possessed a machinegun and that he knew he possessed a

18

dangerous device of a type as would alert one to the

19

likelihood of regulation.

20

The jury was instructed

It's our position that that is sufficient for a

21

conviction under section 5861(d) and that the court

properly rejected petitioner's proposed instruction that

23

would have required the jury to find that he knew that the

24

weapon he possessed had all of the characteristics,

In other words,

And the reason that the Court reached that

agree.

You don't

I think there's -- there's really

distinctions on both sides of that.

21

when Congress enacted the Harrison Narcotics Act -- and

generally in the early part of the century drugs were much
