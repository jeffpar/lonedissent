ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN KNEEDLER

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

14

This is a civil forfeiture case brought by the

15

United States against the respondent real property which

16

was used in the commission of a felony violation of the

17

Federal drug laws.

18

The United States seeks review here of two

19

distinct holdings by the Ninth Circuit.

20

Circuit held that the seizure of the real property for

21

forfeiture, even though it was undertaken pursuant to a

22

warrant issued by a magistrate based on a finding of

23

probable cause, violated the Due Process Clause of the

24

Fifth Amendment because the owner of the property,

25

claimant Good, was not given notice and an opportunity for

First, the Ninth

1

2

a hearing before the seizure was executed.
That ruling, we submit, was erroneous.

The

3

seizure, based on a warrant, fully complied with Fourth

4

Amendment procedures and the Fourth Amendment standard of

5

reasonableness.

6

the Fifth, that the framers of the Bill of Rights

7

furnished an explicit textual source to judge the

8

reasonableness of seizures.

9

Amendment, not the Fifth, that the Bill of Rights balances

It is through the Fourth Amendment, not

And it is through the Fourth

10

private interests against the public interest in law

11

enforcement in this setting.

12

with Fourth Amendment requirements furnishes the process

13

that is due in circumstances such as these.

Put another way, compliance

Excuse me, Mr. Kneedler.
Yes.

21

Process Clause.

22

The Fourth Amendment contains a

It could.

Couldn't that

But our point -- I

23

mean, one -- as an analytical matter, one could look at it

24

either way, that the Fourth Amendment occupies the field

25

and the Due Process Clause simply doesn't address the

1

question, or that the Fourth Amendment supplies the

2

standard.

3

purposes, is that the issuance of a warrant is the

4

procedural protection that the Fourth Amendment

5

specifically identifies for protecting the interests in

6

property, and particularly in a house, as this Court has

7

stated.

But the important point either way, for these

8

And in Gerstein v. Pugh, for example, where the

9

Court considered the determination of probable cause with

10

respect to the detention of an individual, the Court said

11

that no adversarial hearing was required for the

12

determination of probable cause.

13

Fourth Amendment, that that would follow a fortiori with

14

respect to the arrest and detention of real property where

15

a liberty interest is not at stake.

16

QUESTION:

And we think, under the

You think the Fourth Amendment says

17

that a warrant always satisfies the requirement of

18

reasonableness.

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think that's the logic and

20

general thrust of this Court's case is the Court has

21

assumed -- particularly in the context of a seizure of a

22

house, the Court has regarded the warrant protection as an

23

important bulwark in protection for the liberty and

24

property of individuals.

25

and detached magistrate, that is what the framers of the

1

Fourth Amendment placed between individuals and the State.

2

But the general terms of the Due Process Clause,

3

which don't specifically address the question of seizures,

4

don't suggest that a seizure that the Fourth Amendment

5

itself deems reasonable by virtue of the issuance of the

6

warrant, and that is undertaken pursuant to the authority

7

that is constitutionally vested in the seizing officers

8

pursuant to that warrant, is nevertheless in violation of

9

the Constitution itself.
QUESTION:

10
11
12

analysis?

Why did Fuentes go on a different

Is it because there was no seizure?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, Fuentes didn't address the

13

problem in exactly this way, but since Fuentes there have

14

been a number of cases decided by this Court in which the

15

Court has made the very point that I'm making here, that

16

the explicit -- the phrase used in Graham v. Connor, the

17

explicit textual source governing the physical

18

intrusion -- against the person in that case, but the same

19

point is true with respect to the property here -- comes

20

from the Fourth Amendment, and that --

21

QUESTION:

Well, why -- I guess -- I'm not sure

22

why that is self- evident.

23

Soldal that there's no sort of field occupation theory as

24

between the Fourth and the Fifth Amendments.

25

odd to me that Fuentes, which -- and I didn't check this

I mean we - - the Court said in

And it seems

before coming in, may simply have been concerned with

the -- with an - - no, Fuentes involved the seizure of

3

property, didn't it?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.

Because that was replevin.

That

6

Fuentes would have imposed the higher requirement.

7

the later cases, in your judgment, in effect inconsistent

8

with Fuentes?
MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

Are

I think that can all be

10

reconciled in the following respect.

11

we have here is something that was not present in Fuentes

12

and wasn't present in most of the case -- or in the cases

13

dealing with debtor-creditor relations.

QUESTION:

First of all, what

And this is a point that Fuentes itself

Does it matter that the so-called law

practical matter, was unknown at the time the Fourth

25

guess, was unknown.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, certainly seizures of

property for forfeiture was not unknown.

3

QUESTION:

Right.

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

And it was a - - in fact, it was a

5

major source of revenue for the Federal Government at the

6

beginning of the Nation.

7

QUESTION:

Well, it was, but the concept of

8

forfeiture embodied in the present statute is far broader

9

than anything the eighteenth century knew, isn't it?

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, it -- in one respect I

11

think in this case that's not really true conceptually.

12

Because, for example, at the time the Constitution was

13

adopted, ships used in the transportation of goods brought

14

into the United States in violation of customs laws were

15

subject to seizure.

16

seizure, so that the ship was used for a violation of the

17

customs laws and therefore subject to forfeiture.

point is simply -QUESTION:

That would be the analogy here,

wouldn't it?
MR. KNEEDLER:

1

whenever the item of property is used in the commission of

2

the offense, be it a ship or a house, that the same result

3

follows.

4

forfeiture of real property used in the production of

5

illegal liquor, and illegal drugs is the direct analogue

6

of that as well, and there was no prior notice or hearing

7

in Dobbins.
QUESTION:

9

And Dobbins' Distillery, for example, involved

Mr. Kneedler, let me test your

contention that the -- not only does the Fourth Amendment

10

constitute the sole restriction here, but also that a

11

prior warrant automatically makes it reasonable under the

12

Fourth Amendment.

13

Suppose Congress passes a law that says anyone

14

convicted of a certain crime shall forfeit a million

15

dollars, shall be liable for a million dollars fine for

16

that crime.

17

believe that a person has committed that crime, his assets

18

up to the amount of a million dollars shall immediately be

19

seized by the Government to be sure that he will be able

20

to pay the fine.

Moreover, if there is probable cause to

Okay, and you have a probable cause hearing and

21

22

a warrant issues to seize that million dollars of this

23

individual who has not yet been convicted of a crime, but

24

you have probable cause to believe that he committed the

25

crime.

Is it your contention that that automatically

1

complies with the Fourth Amendment and automatically --

2

and you don't have to comply with any other requirement of

3

the Constitution?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think that goes one step beyond

5

this, for the following reason.

As the Court pointed out

6

in Connecticut v. Doehr, that one of the distinctions in

7

that case was that the plaintiff seeking to attach the

8

property in question had no interest, preexisting interest

9

in the property, and the dispute did not concern the

10

particular property.

11

distinctions, which would also be true in your case, where

12

the Government was really trying to attach, in effect,

13

property to secure a fine.

14

QUESTION:

And the Court pointed out those

Oh, the particular property.

So I

15

would have to modify my hypothetical to say anyone guilty

16

of that crime shall forfeit his -- all real estate that he

17

owns up to a value of a million dollars.

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, I'm sorry, I meant the

19

property used in the commission of the offense, which is

20

what we have here.

21

commission of the offense, the Government has an interest

22

in the property because the statute declares it forfeited

23

to the United States by virtue of the commission of the

24

offense.

25

interest in the property itself, not simply as a security

The Government -- at the time of the

So the Government has, in that sense, a direct

but in property itself.
QUESTION:

Okay.

4

under the Fourth Amendment.

There are other requirements even

MR. KNEEDLER:

5

So a prior warrant doesn't

Well, I'm not saying that the

6

warrant would not be sufficient in that case.

All I'm

7

saying is that there is a distinction there.

But the --

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

11

okay, in your view.

Oh, I understand.

Oh, I see.

But -- but -- but --

You're saying that that might be

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

13

QUESTION:

Well --

My original hypothetical, that so

14

long as you have a warrant, even though the individual

15

hasn't been convicted of the crime, you have probable

16

cause to believe he's guilty of the crime, you can seize a

17

million dollars of his assets.

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well you --

So long as you have a warrant.
You might be able to restrain

21

them.

22

But that's very much like what -- the case in Monsanto

23

where the - -

24
25

You couldn't finally subject them to forfeiture.

QUESTION:

You just seize them.

You seize them.

You don't spend them but you say, you know, we'll hold it

money.

Meanwhile, you don't have all your

MR. KNEEDLER:

3

Well, in Monsanto the Court held

4

that the defendant's property there could be restrained on

5

the basis of a finding of probable cause.
QUESTION:

So your answer is yes, that it's

okay.

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

QUESTION:

I think yes.

I thought it was.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

And let me - -

And I don't agree with it.
Let me add a further point to

13

that, that even in the debtor-creditor situation in which

14

the Court has applied the more general balancing test of

15

Mathews v. Eldridge, the Court has not held that a finding

16

of probable cause on the basis of detailed affidavits is

17

insufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clause.

18

In fact, in Mitchell v. W.T. Grant the Court

19

placed heavy reliance on the fact that this was not just a

20

perfunctory review of the submission by the judge.

21

was a determination by the judge on the basis of a

22

detailed affidavit that there was a basis to believe that

23

the plaintiff's claim was valid.

24
25

There

And also in W.T. Grant as well, the Court made
the point that I made about Connecticut v. Doehr.

In that

1

case,

the seller of the goods had an interest in the

property and an interest in insuring that they not be

3

wasted.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler --

5

QUESTION:

As a matter of curiosity, the

6

Government waited 4-1/2 years here, didn't it?
MR. KNEEDLER:

7
8

Why?

After the commission of the

offense.
QUESTION:

9

Yes, why?

MR. KNEEDLER:

10

The record does not disclose why.

11

The claimant Good asked the Government to answer an

12

interrogatories when the Government - - when the DEA agents

13

and other officers learned of the violation.

14

Government declined to answer those on the grounds that

15

they weren't relevant, that that internal reporting was

16

not germane to whether the suit was timely.

17

that the -- that this is - - that the U.S. Attorneys Office

18

was informed or inquired about whether the property was

19

subject to forfeiture.
QUESTION:

20
21

it?

22

And the

I understand

That's kind of a weak excuse,

isn't

Does the Government always wait this long to move in?
MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

Ordinarily the Government

23

would not wait this long.

24

that.

25

the sense that the responsible individuals in DEA knew of

And,

in fact -- let me retract

There's no evidence that the Government waited in

the violation of the drug laws but nonetheless sat on

their hands.

3

came to the attention of the DEA and the U.S. Attorney,

4

forfeiture proceedings were promptly filed.

5

not any finding here of delay.

For all that appears, once the information

So there's

But our point, and this goes to the second issue

6

7

in the case, is that the Ninth Circuit held that if the

8

court -- district court should find on remand that

9

Government agents failed to comply with what the court of

10

appeals itself called internal requirements for the prompt

11

reporting and filing of suits, that the case must be

12

dismissed even though it was filed within the 5-year

13

statute of limitations.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, before you proceed to

15

that second issue in the case, there's one point I'd like

16

you to address.

17

Scalia asked.

18

gave the example of the distillery, but isn't one of the

19

problems with this new extension of the forfeiture that

20

much more is taken than the very house where the drugs

21

were kept?

It's related to the question Justice
You gave the example of the ship and you

How much property was subject to forfeiture?

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

MR. KNEEDLER:

In this case?

Yes.

QUESTION:

1

So it's a 4-acre parcel.

And wasn't

2

one of the trouble spots that even in prohibition what was

3

taken was not all of the property but just the distillery

4

where the liquor was manufactured?
MR. KNEEDLER:

5

That was -- and the parcel on

6

which it was situated.

7

there are separate concerns or separate protections

8

against that possibility, either under the Eighth

9

Amendment as the Court discussed last term, or due process

10

limitations, or perhaps even statutory limitations -QUESTION:

11
12

I think that raises -- I mean,

But I thought that was the due

process -- that was what was sought to be used here.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

But there's not --

And what the Ninth Circuit relied on.
There's been no - - there's no

16

claim before the Court here that too much was taken, as it

17

were.
QUESTION:

18

You mean the only claim is the

19

procedural due process.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Is the procedural due process

claim.
QUESTION:

Well, I doubt the distillery in

Dobbins was located in a 4-acre park too.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, yes, I don't recall exactly

where it was.

What is it that distinguishes the due

recently as last term in Soldal that the Fourth Amendment

7

also governs seizures of property for -- in the civil

8

context as well as in the criminal context.

9

QUESTION:

Well, is there anything in Soldal

10

that indicates that the Fourth Amendment is anything more

11

than a minimum requirement?

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the Court did recite the

13

discussion in Graham v. Connor that I mentioned earlier,

14

that the Fourth Amendment furnishes the explicit textual

15

source for evaluating the intrusion in that case.

16

course, Soldal involved the seizure of a house.

17

And, of

So it seems to us instructive that the Court

18

made that point in that very context.

Now, it did not

19

reach the due process question.

20

at issue in Soldal was whether there was a seizure at all.

21

What would be necessary to render that seizure reasonable

22

especially in connection with a house, that Fourth

Amendment and therefore Fifth Amendment standards are

satisfied.

4

QUESTION:

Well, Graham certainly stands for the

5

proposition, does it not, that if the Fourth Amendment

6

covers a subject we don't go to the Due Process Clause to

7

look for it?
MR. KNEEDLER:

It does.

And that's the point I

was making, and so did Gerstein v. Pugh make that point,
10

so did Baker v. McCollan, so did the GM Leasing case.
QUESTION:

forfeiture of all property that is the product of criminal

and even if it's held by someone who had no part in the

criminal activity, you would assert that before the

malefactor who perpetrated the criminal activity has even

been tried, you can move against an innocent third party,
seize his house on the basis that there is probable cause

you would assert that.

them a warrant of arrest which directed them to arrest,

7

MR. YUEN:

The holding in 92 Buena Vista was

8

that that has the effect of vesting title in the United

States only after there is a final decree of forfeiture.

10

When that title vests, it is retroactively vested as of

the date of the commission of the criminal act.

MR. YUEN:

The owner might still have a number

of defenses, including proportionality, double jeopardy,

and other defenses of a legal nature that exist in a

forfeiture proceeding.

Also, between the time when this

I'd like to spend just a moment on the second

15

issue in the case which is the timeliness issue.

16

difference between the case we have here and the cases

17

that the Government cites on this issue is that we're

18

dealing with a forfeiture here which is an extraordinarily

19

harsh, punitive, and arbitrary sanction.

20

forfeitures are extremely punitive, the courts have held,

21

including this Court, that all statutes governing

22

forfeiture must be strictly construed in favor of the

23

claimant and in favor of the owner of the property.

So in every case we'll have this

factual determination and dispute as to when someone in

the DEA found out and when the Attorney General found out.

10

MR. YUEN:

Well, many cases, if they are timely

11

commenced, will not have this dispute.

If they're --

12

certainly if they're commenced at the same time as the

criminal action, which is very often the case, there will

not be this issue arise.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN KNEEDLER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

I'd like to pick up on the point counsel

21

mentioned about what the -- in response to a question from

22

Justice Kennedy as to what the showing would be of such a

23

determination.

24

probable cause, it would have to be a showing of

25

likelihood of success in the merits.

He says it would have to be more than

This point I think strongly underscores the

1

2

correctness of our position.

3

proceeding the Government prevails by showing probable

4

cause to believe that the property is subject to

5

forfeiture unless the claimant responds by the

6

preponderance of the evidence, of showing that the

7

property was not used for illegal purposes or that he or

8

she was an innocent owner.

9

inquiry in here we think strongly underscores the

10

In a civil forfeiture

So the nature of the relevant

following of the standard Fourth Amendment requirements.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Kneedler, that may be true in

12

this case, but supposing there was a proportionality

13

argument, supposing it was a $10 million home and 2 ounces

14

of marijuana, that arguably the owner would want to

15

argue --to make the point that you shouldn't seize the

16

whole house?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, almost everything that I

18

recall counsel mentioned he put in terms of affirmative

19

defenses.

20

to carry the probable cause requirement, it has to

21

anticipate and be prepared to rebut possible affirmative

22

defenses before it can even take the threshold step of

23

seizing the property at the outset.

It seems to us strange that for the Government

24

The property is subject to forfeiture --

about whether that justified -- it was probable cause to

MR. KNEEDLER:

And so supposing the

Well, there might ultimately be

7

an argument on the merits.

this goes to whether the acreage surrounding the houses

9

would be subject to forfeiture.

10

But, for example in this case,

I don't understand the

respondent to be claiming - -

additional acreage was the sort of thing that required

garage, and there really can be no question as to that.

16

Also, the statute at issue in this case provides for the

17

forfeiture of real property including the whole of any lot

18

used for this purpose, and he hasn't suggested that this

19

is not a lot within the meaning of the forfeiture laws.

20

I'd like to go back to Gerstein v. Pugh again

He's focusing on the house and the

21

where the Court specifically rejected, in the Fourth

22

Amendment context, the argument that an adversary hearing

23

was required for the detention of an individual pending

24

trial.

determination has traditionally been made without an

adversary hearing and that the nature of the probable

2

cause inquiry, which does not require fine considerations

3

and resolving of conflicting evidence but rather whether

4

there's reasonable belief that a crime was committed, does

5

not require an adversary hearing.
We think, as the Chief Justice pointed out, that

6

7

that would follow a fortiori for the seizure of property.

8

And particularly that's so where the -- that would carry

9

the burden of proof on the merits.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Kneedler, I want to be sure

11

you've said whatever you want to say about the timeliness

12

issue.

13

there was no duty to act promptly, or merely that the

14

failure to act promptly does not justify dismissal of the

15

action?

16

Is it the Government's position that the -- that

MR. KNEEDLER:

We say there was no duty.

But

17

our principal submission, and the one we would urge the

18

Court to focus on, is that even if there was, that is

19

doesn't lead to dismissal of the suit.

20

point we think the case is governed by the principle this

21

Court has recognized back beginning with French v. Edwards

he's deprived of the power and the suit can't go forward.

In this case there's nothing in the statutory
