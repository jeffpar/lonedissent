MR. LaCHEEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The case before the Court this afternoon

12

involves a statutory construction.

13

question is part of the antistructuring act.

14

31, U.S. Code section 5322, as it is applied to section

15

5324.

16

The statute in
It's title

The statute was enacted in 1986 to become

17

effective in 1987, and the Ratzlafs were convicted -- the

18

statute punishes the structuring of financial -- currency

19

transactions with financial institutions for the purpose

20

of evading the reporting requirements.

21

tried for activities on their part which took place in

22

1988, approximately 1 year after the statute became

23

effective, for engaging in several transactions without

24

any knowledge on their part that what it was that they

25

were doing was prohibited activity.

The Ratzlafs were

The question before this Court is the

1

2

interpretation of the word "willfully" as it is used in

3

section 5322 to apply to section 5324.

4

The statute -- and in the lower court, the court

5

charged the jury that it was not an essential element of

6

the offense that the Ratzlafs knew that structuring was

7

prohibited.

8

established that there was a financial institution and

9

that there was a reporting requirement, that the Ratzlafs

That it was sufficient if the Government

10

knew about the reporting requirement and they acted with

11

the intent to "frustrate" that reporting requirement.

12

That was the specific word that was used.

13

QUESTION:

The court's

Mr. LaCheen, you said a moment ago

15

that the Ratzlafs acted in this case without any knowledge

16

of the prohibition against structuring.

MR. LaCHEEN:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

There's no finding to that effect, is

there?

defense on their part.

22

the jury was not to consider whether or not -- that was

23

not an essential element of the offense, knowledge that

24

structuring was prohibited.

No.

without any instruction that the Ratzlafs be required to

2

know about the structuring.

3

what they knew, and presumably it's not material.

4

MR. LaCHEEN:

But we don't know as a fact

That's correct, Your Honor, it is

5

not material to the Court's determination.

6

material is the specific mens rea that is required to

7

sustain a conviction in this case.

8

jury without that element, and we submit that a requisite

9

element should be the intentional violation of one's own

What is

The case went to the

10

known legal duty.

11

word "willfully" means as it is used in section 5322 to

12

apply to 5324.

13

And that is what we submit that the

Initially, let me say that in -- the words of

14

5322 simply say that a person who willfully violates this

15

subsection -- and there an argument can be made, and I

16

suppose should be made, that those words themselves

17

require knowledge of the statutory prohibition.

18

not say anybody who commits the following acts is guilty

19

of willful structuring.

20

violating this subchapter, or any regulation under this

21

subchapter.

22

5322 does

It says willful -- willfully

Now, we understand that the cases indicate that

23

this is an ambiguity, and we submit that we can refer to

24

statutory construction, and language construction in the

25

statute itself, to support our argument that what

1

"willfully" means in this context is, in fact, the

2

intentional violation of one's own legal duty.

3

I point first to the fact that if that's not

4

what "willfully" means, then "willfully" doesn't mean

5

anything in this context, because 5324 makes unlawful

6

structuring for the purpose of evading the reporting

7

requirement.

8

that was enacted in 1986.

9

must look to 5322.

And there is no criminal penalty in 5324,
To find a criminal penalty, one

5324 was enacted to become part of

10

this subchapter.

5322 it is, which says willful

11

violations are criminally penalized.

12

And so, therefore, if one must structure a

13

transaction for the purpose of evading the reporting

14

requirement to commit the unlawful act or the prohibited

15

act under 5324, what more is needed with the word

16

"willfully" in 5322 except knowledge that one is violating

17

a known legal duty that is one's own legal duty?

18

as you see, 5324 is the structuring statute which applies

19

to the depositor, and 53 -- it does not create the duty on

20

the depositor.

21

meaning, or it doesn't have --

22

25

Because,

So "willfully" must, in fact, have that

QUESTION:

You say 5324 doesn't create a duty on

the depositor.
MR. LaCHEEN:

2

The reporting requirement is the bank's obligation to file

3

the report for the CTR.

4

comes in in 5322, which makes it a criminal offense, and

5

that's why we say the use of the word "willfully" in 5322

6

to apply to 5324, that supplies the additional -- the

7

requisite element of mens rea that is required.

It is only the willfulness, which

MR. LaCHEEN:

It's read out of the statute

insofar as it would apply to 5324.

aspects; it happens to have no application with respect to

We say it has every application to 5324.

MR. LaCHEEN:

Well, we don't say it has no

On their theory, that's what they

But Congress -- I think one of the principles of

10

statutory construction is that Congress must presume that

11

every word in a statute has meaning, and one of the other

12

arguments I wish to make is that by the time 5324 --

13

QUESTION:

Has all the possible meanings it

could?

15

other sections. It just has no meaning, as you say, with

16

respect to 5324.

17

This has meaning.

MR. LaCHEEN:

It has meaning with respect to

But Congress was aware in 1986

18

when it enacted 5324, without using the word "willfully"

19

or any other word to describe the requisite intent, that

20

"willfully" had already been defined and construed in

21

numerous other cases to mean the intentional violation of

22

a known legal duty.

23

And so one of our other arguments, which Your

24

Honor had anticipated, is that in 1986 when Congress

25

enacted 5324, knowing what these other cases had decided

1

with regard to sections 5313, 5314, 5316, then they

2

incorporated into 5324 by putting it in the subchapter,

3

the same subchapter, where the only criminal penalty was

4

in 5322, which is defined as being a willful violation,

5

then Congress well knew what they were doing.

6

In fact, Congress had the option to change the

7

intent requirement, when it passed 5324, to consider using

8

the word "knowing" instead of the word "willful."

9

was not accepted.

That

And so we say that knowing what the

10

interpretation had been up to that point, Congress

11

incorporated by placing 5324 within that same subchapter

12

where it was subject only to the criminal penalty in 5322,

13

then Congress well knew what it did and did it

14

intentionally, willfully if I may use that word, to

15

require 5322 to apply to 5324.

16

The second argument that we make is that unless

17

"willfully" in this context is read as meaning exactly

18

what we say it means, which is the intentional violation

19

of a known legal duty, then the word would have two

20

different meanings in its same use in the same sentence,

21

because "willfully" has, as I mentioned earlier, been

22

interpreted in a context of these other cases as requiring

23

the intentional violation of one's own legal duty.

Now, Mr. LaCheen, did Congress use

the same statutory language for international structuring

MR. LaCHEEN:

I believe it's close enough so

12

that the issue was exactly the same when it was decided by

13

the court, Justice O'Connor.

QUESTION:

And do you think -- and what result

15

should we reach on the willful requirements or the mens

MR. LaCHEEN:

That a person had to know that

go across the border.

There is a warning.

Strangely enough, this is the one situation, in

2

3

this, where the depositor is never warned.

In fact, when

4

the Government had an opportunity to give a warning and

5

the Treasury Department suggest -- proposed certain

6

regulations to provide warnings in all the banks, that sat

7

there for 6 or 8 months and then, at the behest of the

Department of Justice, Treasury withdrew.

So you can go

There's not a bank that you can go into in

MR. LaCHEEN:

You have the -- you have the

effect of the Government being able to say, these people
can't say they didn't know that structuring was
prohibited.

This is the sign that was in the bank.

And

the Government would hold up a large sign that says -QUESTION:

They take the stand and testify it

was over there with the public enemies list; I never
looked there.
MR. LaCHEEN:

That may then be a jury question,

which the jury would be entitled to consider, just as this
Court -- if I remember correctly, when you sent Cheek back
for retrial you said, of course, one of the things that
the jury will consider is whether this man's subjective
belief was a good faith subject belief.
This would go to the jury the same way.

The

problem here was that these people were deprived of
presenting their good faith defense on this issue.

They

were convicted for conduct which might very well have been
totally innocent conduct, because -QUESTION:

Mr. LaCheen, that's a point that your

brief left me in doubt about, because sometimes you
characterize what they did as a mere regulatory violation
of 5324, and at other times you seem to say that what they
did, absent "willfulness," as you define it, was no
offense at all.

So what is it?

Is what they did a mere

illi-

regulatory violation or is it no violation at all?

2

MR. LaCHEEN:

What the Ratzlafs did was no

3

violation at all.

There is some provision for regulatory

4

violation where the Court could adopt a different

5

standard, for example, for the forfeiture provisions

6

for -- in the same statutory scheme there are various

7

offenses.

8

the scheme subject you to forfeiture; commission of

9

certain other acts subject you to a civil penalty;

One, you know, commission of certain acts under

10

commission of the acts in this case were deemed sufficient

11

to subject them to criminal liability; and then you have

12

the money laundering.

13

There's a whole hierarchy, and one of our

14

arguments is that unless -- if this Court adopts our

15

rationale for "willfully," that puts it in its proper

place in this hierarchy.

MR. LaCHEEN:

2

Why don't we simply use exactly

3

what the situation was in this case, which is that these

people were already being looked at by the Government and

they simply didn't want the Government to have one shred

6

more additional information about them than the Government

7

was entitled to have.

if you happen to know that there's a subpoena out for you

And so therefore -- it's just like

removed totally the element of moral blameworthiness.

Because all you have to do to be convicted is, for

MR. LaCHEEN:
on evading?

The charge --

was there a charge

There was a charge that specifically-

requested that they have knowledge that the statute -that structuring was prohibited.
QUESTION:

There --

That doesn't answer my question.

MR. LaCHEEN:

Yes, I know, I'm begging that.

I

do not think there was a specific question -- a specific
request for evading.
QUESTION:

Did you request such a charge?

MR. LaCHEEN:

We were not trial counsel, Your

Honor, but -QUESTION:

Well, then did trial counsel request

it?
MR. LaCHEEN:

I do not think that was requested.

I think the definition that was given to the jury obviated
that request.

We can -- I believe at page 13 of our

appendix, the court read the regulation and the regulation
defines evading so that it means avoiding.
for purposes of section -- the court has it:

It simply says
"A person

structures a transaction if that person, acting alone or
in conjunction with or on behalf of other persons,
conducts or attempts to conduct one or more transactions
in any amount at one or more financial institutions at one
or more days in any manner, for the purpose of evading the

reporting requirements."
Evading was defined as it is used in the

3

statute.

4

report being made, you were -- you had, in fact, evaded.
QUESTION:

5
6

Well that was a definition of

regulation, not of a statute, wasn't it?

7
8

I you simply did what was necessary to avoid the

MR. LaCHEEN:
correct in that.

9

That's correct.

Your Honor is

Let me see, where am I?

The other point I wished to make -- and this

10

picks up what we've discussed previously -- was that it

11

seems to be -- it has been traditional and is deeply

12

rooted in the American system of criminal justice that

13

there must be some moral -- some concept, some component

14

of moral blameworthiness, not simply just an act which may

15

avoid the onus of a legal regulation or, in fact, a tax.
I mean, this has been traditional.

16

If a line

17

is -- if the law draws a line, the avoidance of that line

18

by legal means, it does not subject one to any legal

19

censure.

20

versus -- U.S. v. Isham, where, on facts extremely similar

21

to this, a man decided to issue drafts in amounts less

22

than $10 -- actually, less than $11, because the stamp

23

duty tax applied to drafts in amounts exceeding $10.

24

this --

25

I mean, this Court said that in 1873 in Isham

Well, it makes sense to me.

I can't, for the life of me,

MR. LaCHEEN:

Let me give you another situation.

Perhaps this will answer --

13

QUESTION:

It smells bad to me.

14

MR. LaCHEEN:

This statute, as it is currently

15

applied -- it has not only been applied to these people,

16

but we cited another situation in our brief in which a

17

legitimate businessman who is very busy and makes one

18

deposit of cash a week for years and years.

19

He doesn't have time to run to the bank every day.

He's busy.

20

And the bank then says to him we're not going to

exempt your deposits any more; you're now going to have to

22

file a report every time you put in $10,000.

He

He's guilty of structuring.
That's not a made-up case.

2

3

That's one of the --

that's a defendant whose case is pending cert.

And if

4

you accept the Government's analysis of what "evade"

5

means, that it doesn't mean anything more than avoid, and

6

you accept the Government's argument, which the court did

7

in this case, that all you had to do was tell -- know that

8

there was a bank reporting requirement, then your actions

9

in avoiding exposing your business and invading your

privacy constitutes some kind of an offense without any

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20

MR. LARKIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
We start with the elementary principle that

21

ignorance of the law is no excuse.

And we, like 10 of the

22

11 courts of appeals that have considered the question

23

presented in this case, believe that that principle,

24

considered together with the standard tools of statutory-

25

interpretation, show that it is our theory of the case and

1

not petitioners' that is the correct one.

2

So let's start with the text of the statute.

3

Section 5324 requires the Government to prove that a

4

person structured a transaction for the purpose of evading

5

the reporting requirement.

6

this case.

7

pages 11 to 12 of our brief, and there is no complaint

8

raised by the petitioners that those instructions, in that

9

regard, were erroneous.

The jury was so instructed in

The instructions are in the Joint Appendix at

10

Section 5322 imposes criminal liability if a

11

person acts willfully, and this Court in various cases

12

such as Browder, Murdock, and most recently Cheek, has

13

said that the term "willfully" generally means

14

intentionally rather than inadvertently, accidentally, or

15

negligently.

16
17
18

Now, the Court has gone on to say --

QUESTION:

interpretation here is redundancy of the requirement.
MR. LARKIN:

Scalia pointed out.

20

QUESTION:

21

22

That's -- the price of adopting that

Not across the board, as Justice

Yeah.

But in -- with respect to this

transaction, it is absolutely redundant on your theory.
MR. LARKIN:

And we don't see that as being a

23

flaw, and let me explain why, if the structuring -- of the

way the statute is put --

6

of lower court cases that had addressed this problem here,

7

structuring transactions to evade these reporting

8

requirements which Congress, in 1970, believed were an

9

invaluable means of helping to root out money laundering.

10

There was a line of cases typified by decisions

11

such as the Tobon-Builes case, which has come to be known

12

as the leading case in this area from the Government's

13

perspective, that were decided by the Eleventh Circuit,

14

and there a similar decision by the Second Circuit.

15

were contrary decisions by the First and Ninth Circuits,

16

so that in different parts of the country it was clear

17

that the same conduct could and could not be criminally

18

prosecuted, and Congress passed this statute to deal with

19

that precise problem.

20

Congress didn't pass section 5324 as a model code
Congress didn't pass this statute to
It has a precise
There were two lines

So in this context, if there is some redundancy

21

we're willing to accept that fact.

The reason is the

22

principle that the other side relies on, the canon against

23

construing something to create redundancy, we agree is a

24

valuable one, but it's not invaluable in every context.

25

It's most valuable in the context that I've mentioned;

it's far less valuable in this one.
QUESTION:

2

And

Not unless it's no value at all.

I

mean your argument is that the 5324 offense is just what

it would be if you never had 5322.
MR. LARKIN:

5
6

5322 adds nothing.

That's right.

Because 5324 was

added to deal with this problem.
Congress passed this statute and added the

scienter requirement to deal with the precise problem that

it had to focus on because of that, as I said, clear

QUESTION:

What was the scienter requirement you

say Congress was addressing in 5324?
MR. LARKIN:

18

The scienter requirement discussed

19

in the lower court cases such as Tobon-Builes, which said

20

that a person violates this statute when he structures a

21

transaction for the purpose of evading the reporting

22

requirement.

23

that's what the relevant committee reports discussed.

24

Those committee reports can be found at pages 33 to 35 of

25

our brief.

That's what the Eleventh Circuit said and

That's what Congress focused on as far as the

relevant scienter requirement in this statute.
QUESTION:

2

3

So you say Congress was there

addressing exactly the same issue we're dealing with here.

4

MR. LARKIN:

Yes, Your Honor, I do.

That's

5

exactly what happened here in this case.

6

very real world, practical problem to deal with, and it

7

focused precisely on that problem, rather than revisiting

8

the entire area of money laundering.

9
10

QUESTION:

Congress had a

Assuming it did that, why did it use

evade rather than avoid?
MR. LARKIN:

11

Because, Your Honor,

"evade" is a

term that indicates, as Justice Scalia pointed out, a

13

certain nefarious purpose involved.

14

petitioners here in this case were driving around Lake --

After all, the

QUESTION:

Which is consistent, isn't it, with

17

the argument that they probably intended "willfully" to

18

mean what your opponents say it does?

19

MR. LARKIN:

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

20

Because you can have the term "willfully" used in a

21

context where deception is at issue, and you don't require

discussed.

1

you -- was the grandfather of this more recent line of tax

2

cases imposing the heightened scienter requirement.
And the Court expressly rejected the defendant's

3
4

attempt to rely on the Murdock decision in that case.

It

5

said instead, in a context where deception was at issue

6

since it was the knowing use and the willful use of a

7

falsely obtained passport, that only an intentional act,

8

not the type of action that the petitioners are asking

9

for, is sufficient.

So you can have deceptive conduct,

10

which is at issue here, where you have the lower scienter

11

requirement that we're talking about in this context.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Larkin, can I ask you a question

13

to help me understand this statute?

14

I remember it, there were several transactions where the

15

man and the woman each bought a $9,500 cashier's check,

16

and so each transaction was structured in the sense that

17

each bank had a duty to report more than $10,000 if it had

18

been done.

19

individual went to six separate banks and got $9,500

20

thinking that no one of those banks would have had a

21

reporting requirement?

22

In the Tobon case, as

Now, would the same reasoning apply if one

MR. LARKIN:

Yes.

The legislative history, for

23

example, that I mentioned earlier expressly says that if

24

you go to more than one bank you can be guilty of

25

violating the statute.

And the regulation that defines

1

structuring also makes clear that going to more than one

2

bank can amount to structuring under the statute.

3

Nov;, the problem you've talked about, Your

4

Honor, is a problem dealing more with the actus reas

5

element, the structuring, than the mens rea element.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. LARKIN:

8

That's correct.
But what it does indicate, I think,

is this, that you don't have a situation here where

MR. LARKIN:

It would smell worse, Your Honor,

sufficiently foul that what you have is precisely the type

16

of conduct that Congress feared was connected with other

points about that, because of the last phrase you

normal course of business.

In other words, if you run a

grocery store and deal in a large quantity of cash, you
can ask the bank to exempt you from having to fill out
these requirements.
QUESTION:

violation of the act.

the tax investigation was dropped and this one was

No.

This was part of it.

it started out as an investigation to determine whether

someone had violated the tax laws, and a prosecutorial

QUESTION:

11

Mr. Larkin, can I just ask you for

some comment on sort of the general thrust that Justice

13

Scalia's questioning raised?

14

that a legitimate person would be concerned about the

15

disclosure of this kind of information?

16

Is it reasonable to suppose

And the question that -- one question that -- I

17

have two questions.

One is what is the use made by the

Does this go to the Internal Revenue

19

Service, is that it, or does it also go to U.S. Attorneys

20

General if you're suspicious of narcotics dealings and all

21

the rest?

22

And before you answer it, the reason I ask is it

23

occurs to me that a legitimate citizen might think, well,

if I have to file this report, I'm increasing

25

substantially the chance of a tax audit.

But I do think what we have here is a situation where,

fairly read, the statute deals with the precise problem

that Congress had considered, given the conflicting lower

And, in sum, we think that when you start with

Mr. Larkin, you didn't even cite this

13

given in that old case was to avoid the stamp tax, it's

3

And the second is this.

That dealt with a

statute that, as I said earlier, drew a line and said

those who cross it have to engage certain obligations.

Here, Congress was drawing a statute that was designed to

keep people away from the line.

With regard to those offenses,

1

I want to remind the Court that in almost every one of

2

those situations, there was at least an element of moral

3

blameworthiness in the initial act.

4

One can compare this not to the hand grenade

5

case so much as to, for example, U.S. v. Feola, where this

6

Court said it wasn't necessary that the person who struck

7

an individual knew that the person was a Federal officer

8

to be convicted of the offense of assaulting a Federal

9

officer.

In the case of U.S. v. Yermian, this Court

10

decided that you didn't have to know that a falsehood was

11

given to a Federal agency or within the jurisdiction of

12

the Federal agency once you made the falsehood.

13

But in those cases and every similar case, there

14

was something morally blameworthy in the initial act.

15

was either an assault, it was perjury, it was a lie, or it

16

was some other act which says, contrary to just having

17

$10,000, there's something morally blameworthy about it.

22

that people that have large amounts of money are

QUESTION:

And what we --

Well, Congress, if it chooses, can

5

set out and devise a net that will catch minnows and

6

sharks.

8

MR. LaCHEEN:
absolutely.

If they notify them, Your Honor,

And the difference in this case is that up to

January -- to pick a date -- January 1, 1 87, the conduct
10

which the Government wants to use to create the moral

11

blameworthiness here, that is the avoidance of certain

12

regulations, was never considered -- not only was it

13

considered noncriminal, it was never considered unlawful.

14

So how can doing that act constitute the moral

15

blameworthy element that makes you guilty of what you

16

don't know, which is the fact that there is a statute that

17

specifically prohibits the conduct?

18

kind of case where you have to have knowledge of the

1

statute, because otherwise you don't know that you're

20

violating the law, and the only thing morally blameworthy

21

is that you violated a law which Congress has passed.

22

23
24
25

QUESTION:

This is exactly the

There is a statute here which

specifically prohibits the conduct, and it's 5324.
MR. LaCHEEN:

2

is -- subjects you to the criminal penalty of 5322.

3

prior to January, 1987, no one knew that, and the

4

Government has taken every step not to notify anyone that

5

that is an offense.

QUESTION:

But

Where do you get any requirement like

7

that out of our cases, that every time Congress passes a

new criminal statute it has to notify everybody?
MR. LaCHEEN:

9

Only if it is conduct which was

10

not previously blameworthy.

statute, the requirement in there.

17

MR. LaCHEEN:

18

QUESTION:

If you notify people.

The only issue here is whether we

1

should believe that Congress, in this case, has passed

20

such a statute.

21

majority of cases it's going to be picking up people who

22

do have some nefarious motive, then maybe Congress did

23

pass such a statute.

24
25

And it seems to me that if in the vast

MR. LaCHEEN:

I don't think that we've gotten to

the point where we don't mind convicting innocent people

because we're going to get some guilty people with the

same act, and that's what they did with this statute.

QUESTION:

MR. LaCHEEN:

QUESTION:

They

Well, of course, Mr. LaCheen, that's,

of course, the issue in the case.

MR. LaCHEEN:

They didn't violate the law.

didn't knowingly violate the law, and --

They violated the

law.

What innocent?

That is.

But let me just ask you this

question, because --

12

MR. LaCHEEN:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Stevens.

You don't -- you're not arguing any

14

constitutional objection to the Government's reading of

15

the statute.

16

MR. LaCHEEN:

17

QUESTION:

We --

And if it's -- at least assuming

18

you're not, what do you do with the legislative history

19

that suggests they wanted to codify the result in the

20

Tobon case?
MR. LaCHEEN:

21

Two things.

One, that's not

22

that -- it's specific that that's what they wanted to deal

23

with.

24

resolved it was to lower the element of scienter.

25

did not change -- and they specifically did not change

It is not clear that that -- the way in which they

They

"willfully" to

being the case, I think it's proper to assume that they

3

continued, in effect, the application of "willfully" as it

4

had previously been developed, and that is what they

5

wanted.

6

"knowingly" when they enacted 5324.

That

Yes, they wanted the guilty people, but the

7

guilty people are the ones that "willfully" violate the

8

statute, not the guy like Ratzlaf or the guy like Shirk,

9

the other case I mentioned, where people do it as part of

10

their normal business procedure or because they want to

11

maintain their own privacy for a nonnefarious, nonmorally

12

blameworthy act.

13

QUESTION:

In the Tobon case, the argument was

14

made that we didn't do anything that was -- that we had

15

any reason to know it was unlawful.

16

MR. LaCHEEN:

They did --

The jury may have rejected that,

case, but at least those people had the benefit of going

19

to the jury, I believe, with that instruction.

20

in this case didn't have that benefit.

21

that all they had to know was that there was a requirement

22

and that they acted in such a way so that the bank didn't

23

file the report.

24

know there was some duty on them.

25

The jury may have rejected it in that

They were told

They were never told that they had to

which Justice Scalia has mentioned, are cases where the

duty is directly upon the person violating the duty.

you're the person in the car and you're the person that

has the duty to obey that law.

If

7

In this case -- this is a rhetorical question,

8

but I want to know how a depositor who walks into a bank
is supposed to know that because the bank has a duty to

10

file a paper, that there's some duty on him to give them

11

the information necessary to file it?

transferred of duty.

And I submit that that is so far

If the Secretary had issued a

17

regulation requiring your client to file these

transactions, you would have no case.

MR. LaCHEEN:

That's a different story.

And

20

they didn't do it because they -- that's exactly right.

21

That's a different story, Your Honors.

Thank you.
