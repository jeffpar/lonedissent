ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK A. JUNG

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. JUNG:

12

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The case before this Court involves whether the

15

double jeopardy principles of Bullington should be

16

extended to noncapital sentencing proceedings, whether

17

doing so would be Teague-barred, and, indeed, whether

18

Bullington should be overturned.

1

The purpose of sentencing is to assure that the

20

punishment fits the offender, and not merely the offense.

21

Defendant's status, and not his conduct, is the linchpin

22

of sentencing.

23

factor that the sentencer should consider.

24

sentencing focuses on the proper punishment, the Double

25

Jeopardy Clause has never prevented a sentencer from

Because

1
2

imposing a higher sentence upon resentencing.
In fact, in United States v. DiFrancesco, this

3

Court stated that the task is to determine whether the

4

criminal sentence, once pronounced, is to be accorded

5

constitutional finality and conclusiveness similar to that

6

which attaches to a jury's verdict of acquittal.

7

Court stated:

8

sentencing practices, nor the pertinent rulings of the

This

"We conclude that neither the history of

court, not even consideration of double jeopardy policy,
10
11

supports an equation."
The procedures required for sentencing a

12

defendant as a persistent offender in Missouri include

13

pleading the prior convictions in the indictment, or

14

information, introduction of evidence of the defendant's

15

prior convictions at a hearing conducted outside the

16

presence of the jury and prior to submitting the case to

17

the jury, and a finding by the judge that the defendant is

18

a persistent offender.

1

The statute allows for the use of presentence

20

investigation reports and commitments as proof of a prior

21

conviction.

22

introduction -- introducing certified copies of prior

23

convictions and commitment reports is prima facie proof

24

that the defendant is the person named in the prior

25

convictions for the purpose of the habitual offender

Case law in Missouri has established that

1

statute.
Once a prima facie proof is made,

2

the burden

3

shifts to the defendant to disprove the prior convictions.

4

If the defendant fails to rebut the prima facie proof,

5

trial court may rely on that prior -- those prior

6

convictions for invoking the habitual offender statute.

7

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Jung, what -- the

8

consequences of habitual offender in Missouri, do I

9

understand right that the only consequence is that the

10

judge -- that the jury will no longer recommend the

11

sentence, but that the range would be identical?

In this case, Your Honor,

Do you know if this scheme is

Bullington in this case would be wrong, it seems to me, a

fortiori, you must claim that applying Bullington in this

case would be new?

4

MR. JUNG:

That's -- that's correct, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION:

And so why isn't all of this

Teague-barred?
MR. JUNG:

8

Your Honor.

9

Teague-barred.

That's -- Your Honor. That's correct,

We have raised that this issue is
The court below found that it was not

10

Teague-barred, because they said you could stretch

11

Bullington into the application of non -- noncapital

12

sentencing proceedings.

13

stretching Bullington alone would be Teague-barred,

14

because it is not dictated by past precedents of this

15

case -- this Court.

16

QUESTION:

And our position is that

So it's your view that our choice is

17

essentially between two things; either we hold it

18

Teague-barred or we overrule Bullington, but there's no

19

way to say that this - - to rule on the merits of this

20

question if we incline toward your view?

21

MR. JUNG:

I think, Your Honor, the Court could

22

state that double jeopardy doesn't apply to noncapital

23

sentencing proceedings in and or itself, and not have to

24

reach whether it is a new rule.

25

apply that -- that Bullington doesn't apply to noncapital

If this Court were to

1

sentencing proceedings, we wouldn't have the issue of

2

whether it's Teague-barred.

3

to interpret that Bullington does apply to noncapital

4

sentencing proceedings, then we would argue that it is

5

Teague-barred because it would be an application of a new

6

rule on a collateral appeal.
QUESTION:

7

If it's -- if this Court were

And back -- are you saying that we

8

would get to the Teague question only if we are inclined

9

to rule against you?
MR. JUNG:

10

I believe so, Your Honor, even though

11

I -- there are cases that say Teague is a threshold issue,

12

so it seems like it could be, in some certain situations.

13

Some cases have said that Teague is a threshold issue,

14

saying that we have to look for -

QUESTION:

Teague said that, didn't it?

MR. JUNG:

I believe your -- in Saffle v. Parks,

I believe, also stated that also, Your Honor.

didn't reach the merits.
MR. JUNG:

That's correct, Your Honor.

So it

would be - - we - - I would concede that if you determine

22

that this could be Teague-barred, and not rule on the

merits.

That's correct, Your Honor.

expansive degree of discretion that is involved in the

2

sentencing proceeding here, as distinct from the degree of

3

discretion in the -- in the Bullington situation.

4

MR. JUNG:

That's correct, Your Honor.

I think

5

that this Court has always recognized that in noncapital

6

sentencing proceedings, that there is a more greater

7

emphasis to allow the jury to make that finding within the

8

broader range of punishment, and they have a more expanded

9

range of punishment which they can impose, unlike

10

situations where it's either life or death in capital

11

situations, Your Honor.

12

Also under the Missouri statute, Your Honors,

13

the trial court may take judicial notice of testimony

14

regarding the defendant's habitual offenses.

15

to say, that in Missouri the court could just not have to

16

have a prior offender hearing separate and distinct.

17

could recognize the testimony at trial and hold, in and

18

off itself, based on that testimony, that the defendant is

19

an habitual offender.

So, needless

The fact that the presentence investigation and

21

commitment reports can be admitted into evidence, along

22

with the fact that a certified copy of the judgement and

conviction, demonstrates that habitual offender statute is

25

a ministerial act.

Because Missouri's habitual offender

does not apply.

3

QUESTION:

Is there any indication --

4

QUESTION:

Well, it might not be a ministerial

5

act if the defendant wanted to challenge some prior

6

conviction on the ground that he had not been afforded

7

counsel, or something like that.
MR. JUNG:

8

9

That's correct.

If the defendant

were to challenge it, this burden would shift back to the

10

defendant to prove that it was uncounseled.

11

challenge the conviction, in and of itself, but he could

12

challenge a constitutionality, such as it was an

13

uncounseled guilty plea.

QUESTION:

He could not

Is there any indication why, the

15

first time around, there was nothing in the record to show

No, Your Honor, there is nothing in

the record.

Prior to Bullington, the protections afforded by

defendant was a dangerous special offender in that -- in

that case.

5

QUESTION:

But that -- that was decided before

Bullington, wasn't it?

6

MR. JUNG:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

QUESTION:

So you really can't say that that

8

case decided that Bullington didn't extend to noncapital

9

cases, if it came before Bullington.

10

MR. JUNG:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

think that Lockhart v. Nelson, this Court specifically

12

stated that the issue was not before it at that time, and

13

stated that the Court -- because all the parties assumed

14

that it did apply, but they didn't address that issue and

15

specifically left it open.

16

I

In extending the Double Jeopardy Clause to

17

capital sentencing proceedings, this Court determined that

18

the capital sentencing proceedings are unique because they

19

so resemble a trial, the so-called uniqueness found by

20

this Court in Bullington, including opening statements,

21

testimony, introduction of evidence, jury instructions,

22

final arguments, and jury deliberations.

23

coupled with the prosecutor's requirement to prove certain

24

statutorily defined facts beyond a reasonable doubt, and

25

the jury's limitation of imposing either life or death,
12

SUITE 400

(800) FOR DEPO

These facts,

1

led this Court to believe the Double Jeopardy Clause

2

applied to capital sentencing proceedings.

3

Unlike capital sentencing proceedings,

4

noncapital sentencing proceedings do not require the

5

same -- do not require the same unique characteristics.

6

Although a separate proceeding is required to establish

7

whether defendant is an habitual offender under Missouri

8

statutes, this proceeding is conducted before a judge and

9

not a jury, and is conducted prior to the jury's

10
11

determination of guilt or innocence.
The purpose of the hearing is to determine if

12

the judge or jury will determine the defendant's sentence.

13

There are no opening statements, closing arguments, nor is

14

there any instructions or jury deliberation.

common characteristics between capital sentencing

16

proceedings and non - -

QUESTION:

The only

May I ask, just to be sure I

18

understand your position, supposing all those things were

19

true, supposing you decided in Missouri to have the

20

multiple offender statute -- I forget the name of it --

apply only after a jury found all the facts that the judge

22

now finds, prior convictions and -- would it make any

23

difference to you?

MR. JUNG:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

The second one was the proof beyond the

16

had to have a mandatory sentence longer, say it was a

little more severe than it is here, would that be a

18

distinguishing feature then?

MR. JUNG:

I think that could be considered.

20

Your Honor, if you looked at it and you saw all three

factors.

Is the main point that this -- that

here the judge does the sentencing, and in Bullington it

was the jury?
MR. JUNG:

8

I - - case law, Your Honor, I believe

states that there is no distinction between judge
10

sentencing and jury sentencing, so that wouldn't be that

11

relevant, whether the judge or jury did the sentencing.
QUESTION:

12

So as soon as you -- as soon as

13

you've acknowledged that, then the absence of instructions

14

to the jury, of course, is just because it's a judge, not

15

a jury.

16

MR. JUNG:

That's correct, Your Honor.

But

17

there is no -- the issue is, basically, whether this is a

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

12

MR. KELLEY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I want to make two points this morning.

The

13

first is that the Court's decision in Bullington v.

14

Missouri is distinguishable from this case and does not

15

control the outcome here, and the second point is that the

16

Court ought not to extend Bullington to cover this case.

17

On the first point, we submit that the

18

persistent offender determination in Missouri is quite

19

unlike the trial-like process that was at issue in

20

Bullington.

21

Bullington, the procedure is very much trial-like.

22

Court relied on that factor heavily in Bullington, and in

23

this case, and in persistent offender determinations

24

generally, those features are not fully present.

was like a trial with a verdict, quote, on the question of

2

life or death, the Court thought, and was willing to treat

3

the outcome of that proceeding as though it were analogous

4

to be a conviction or a verdict on the question of guilt

6

The persistent offenders determination in

Missouri is far different.

MR. KELLEY:

Justice O'Connor, our position is

12

that Bullington's rationale, under current sentencing

practices, really only applies in capital sentencing

proceedings in this country.

or death nature of the inquiry.

That is quite true.

Our position is that Bullington

QUESTION:

MR. KELLEY:

Well, I think it's a hard question.
The rationale of Bullington would,

have to decide whether all of the features that were

present in Bullington were present in that system.

QUESTION:

Suppose all -- see, my hypothesis,

all of them are present except it's a different sentence.
MR. KELLEY:

Well, I have two responses.

First,

18

this Court's subsequent decision in Poland v. Arizona

19

emphasized quite heavily the life or death nature of the

20

decision in Bullington and was willing to treat that as an

21

implied acquittal type situation.

22

But more -- more importantly, it seems to me

23

that the States are under no constitutional compulsion, in

24

the case that you described, to provide such procedures.

So in such a case, a State would have the argument that it

MR. KELLEY:

No, it does not, Your Honor.

11

The decision in Bullington did not rest on that.

12

me emphasize again that the rationale of Bullington was

13

that because there was this full trial-like process and

14

because it was a question of life or death, an up-down,

MR. SINDEL:

10

QUESTION:

And the range is rather large.
The range is 10 years to 30 years

And so the only consequence, as I

11

understand it, is that this case would have to go back, if

12

you're right, for an entire new trial before a new jury;

13

is that right?

14

MR. SINDEL:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

That is State law, Your Honor.
Because you couldn't have a jury just

come in for the penalty, not having heard the evidence.
MR. SINDEL:

That is correct.

There are no

18

separate bifurcated proceedings, except in the capital

context, in the State of Missouri.

QUESTION:

So there would be a whole new trial,

MR. SINDEL:

The second time there were

allows for certified copies to be utilized by the Court in

making a prima facie determination as to whether or not

It is simply, as the

There's basically two distinguishing factors

from Bullington to this particular case.

One is the

existence of jury sentencing, and clearly that makes no

difference in terms of the application of Bullington, as

All those

But in terms of the Teague issue, besides the

fact that there was jury sentencing, which Arizona v.

is death is different, which this Court -- at the time

19

indicated that in some opinion or another.

It does, Your Honor.
Does it -- is it defined in terms of

prior convictions, or just general behavior?
MR. SINDEL:

Prior convictions, as well as the

elements of the underlying offense of conviction.
QUESTION:

Are there -- is it conceivable that

7

there will be issues of fact in a - - say the charge was

8

dangerous offender rather than persistent offender, that
might involve more conflicts in evidence than just whether

10

or not there was a certified copy of a conviction?

11

MR. SINDEL:

That is correct.

12

In terms of the amount of evidence that's

13

necessary, there are -- there could be a number of

14

criminal trials in which a determination of guilt or

15

innocence and a sentence could be imposed where similar

16

evidence was presented.

17

For example, as this Court recognizes, the

18

Double Jeopardy Clause applied in the United States v.

1

Dixon, an individual can be found in contempt of court and

20

be sentenced based on conduct simply by admission and

21

judicial notice of the record that the individual had been

22

served with the decree of the court; and if he had pled

23

guilty to the underlying offense that resulted in the

24

contemptuous behavior, a document indicating that that

25

particular plea of guilty had occurred.

And those two

1

documents, in and of themselves, would be sufficient to

2

prove beyond a reasonable doubt.
So I don't believe it's the amount of time or

3
4

the amount of witnesses or the quality or the quantity of

5

the evidence that's presented.

6

State places upon the prosecution in order to make --

7

reach that determination and the fact that they accord the

defendant various constitutional rights that are the

equivalent of what he's --

It is the burden that the

But it's not too unusual, is it, to

have a guilty plea on the merits and then have a hearing

10

on sentencing, on mitigation and aggravation, even in a

noncapital case?
MR. SINDEL:

12

The only reason I say it, Your

MR. SINDEL:

If the judge in Missouri indicates

that he is not going to be bound by the negotiations, then

he will probably tell the parties that, and the plea may

then go forward, but obviously the defense counsel would

QUESTION:

Your answer to the Teague question

3

that Justice O'Connor asked is simply that the contrary

authority was, as the Eighth Circuit said -- they used

some adjective besides mistaken -- seriously mistaken, is

6

that -- that's it?

MR. SINDEL:

That's the adjective, I believe,

that's in the opinion, that's correct, Your Honor.
In terms of dealing with the Teague issue, as

10

well there's also the exceptions of Teague.

And it's our

11

position that the Double Jeopardy Clause has especial

12

implications as far as the first exception to Teague,

13

which requires that new rules that place an entire

14

category of primary conduct beyond the reach of the

15

criminal law, or that prohibit imposition of a certain

16

time of punishment for a class of defendants because of

17

their status or offense.

18

Which is the application that was used by this

19

Court in Penry v. Lynough and joined by all the Justices

20

in making the determination as to whether or not there is

21

a particular category in which an individual may be

22

insulated from the determination or the application of the

23

Teague principles.

24

Jeopardy Clause, in fact, does this, and does provide this

25

sort of insulating protection to this particular defendant

and to other defendants.

2

It's very difficult, in many ways, to apply the

3

double jeopardy principles to the Teague analysis in some

4

ways, and this has been recognized by this Court in

5

Robinson v. Neil when it determined that the double

6

jeopardy applications in Waller v. Florida were to be

7

retroactive.

QUESTION:

8

9

And Benton v. Maryland -But that was long before Teague,

though, wasn't it?
MR. SINDEL:

10

That is correct, Your Honor.

To

11

the best of my knowledge, this situation is the first time

12

that the Court has had to address the double jeopardy

13

implications in a Teague -- in light of Teague.

14

difficulty with Teague -- for example, one of the

15

exceptions in Teague talks about the accuracy of the

16

proceedings and the fact-finding proceedings.

17

difficulty with applying the double jeopardy principles is

18

double jeopardy is not necessarily concerned with

accuracy.

with use of their resources over and over, will undermine

2

the defendant and eventually be able to obtain a verdict,

3

even though he may be innocent.
QUESTION:

4

But you're concerned -- or we are

5

concerned in this case with an entirely different accuracy

6

concern, and that is the concern for adequate evidence

7

before making a determination.

8

to apply -- to allow the rehearing on this issue is going

9

to enhance the possibility of accuracy, not undermine it.
MR. SINDEL:

10

So that in point of fact,

That -- that is conceivably

11

correct, Your Honor.

But in every situation in which the

12

Double Jeopardy Clause, there is the possibility that the

13

actual determination of the -- that the offender is guilty

14

or not guilty may be undermined or undervalued.
And, in fact, this Court in Ohio v. Johnson and

15
16

United v. Scott -- United States v. Scott, the Chief

17

Justice indicated that that is not the determination, as

18

to whether or not he is, in fact, innocent.

or not there's been a proceeding that has occurred in

20

which the State has had that opportunity to present its

evidence.

1

I do not believe that our

2

position -- I'd like to tell the Court that our position

3

under the second Teague analysis is pristine and easily

4

determined.

5

the double jeopardy precludes the trial from taking place

6

so that there is no accuracy determination, there is no

7

fact-finding process.

I don't believe it is.

And that is because

And as this Court recognized in Robinson v.

8

9

Neil, in a trial, a second trial could be perfectly fair.

10

It could have -- it could be the best trial in the world,

11

but that isn't the situation, and that's why Robinson v.

12

Neil held that double jeopardy application had to be

13

retroactive, and that's why Ashe v. Swenson said that

Benton v. Maryland was retroactive, because the procedures

say, well, the second time around we've got more evidence

and, you know, both sides can marshal their resources

argument of double jeopardy is you shouldn't have a second

MR. SINDEL:

If you

But the

In Ashe v. Swenson, however, the

concern was, that as the State admitted at that -- in that

particular proceeding, was that we had used the first

We believe that -- in terms of the Teague

analysis, that a persistent offender or someone who has

been charged as a persistent offender is a category of

defendants that would be insulated, then, from the

precluded from, you know, relitigating the persistent

offender status on that particular crime and that

I think it's important to understand that in

We believe so, Your Honor.

In any

MR. JUNG:

That's correct, Your Honor.

The issue that I'd like to raise here on

rebuttal, Your Honors, are that respondent seems to assert

that we're not looking at the double jeopardy applying to

sentencing, we're determining to the status.

18

they're asking it to apply to a status, it would be a new

rule implication, because this Court has never decided

20

that it applies to the status of an habitual offender.

21

The status is no different from the factual question of

22

sentencing, but it is a distinction that a court has made.

Clearly, if

The issue of whether double jeopardy applies to

noncapital cases is subject to debate, as Justice O'Connor

has noted.
