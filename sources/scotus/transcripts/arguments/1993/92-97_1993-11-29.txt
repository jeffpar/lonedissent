ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER A. SMITH, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SMITH:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The Court has agreed in this case to decide

11

whether the user fees that are imposed on the airlines and

12

their passengers at the Kent County Airport are reasonable

13

within the meaning of the Federal aviation laws and within

14

the meaning of the Commerce Clause.

15

appear to be agreed that the criteria by which the Court

16

should decide this question are those set out by the Court

17

in the Evansville decision, and we believe those are the

18

minimum criteria that the Court ought to apply in this

19

case, and when the Court applies those criteria, we

20

believe the Court should find that the methodology used by

21

Kent County in fact violates the criteria in at least

22

three different ways.

23

All parties here

First, the fee methodology is not based on a

24

fair approximation of use by the various users at the

25

airport -- that is, that the costs are not fairly

1

allocated among users -- second, the revenues that are

2

produced by the fee methodology are vastly in excess of

3

the airport's own costs in delivering service to the

4

users, and finally, the airport's fee methodology

5

deliberately discriminates against the airlines in favor

6

of local aviation.

7

I would like to comment on each of these three

8

requirements, and then, if time allows, I would also like

9

to comment on an issue that we do not think is properly

10

before the Court, but that the Solicitor General and the

11

airport do -- that is, whether or not, even if the fees

12

are unreasonable, whether the airlines are permitted to

13

bring a legal action to challenge them.

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

So let me start

Yes, Your Honor.
And that is one of the questions

presented in the petition, is it not?
MR. SMITH:

20

It is not, Your Honor.

It was not

21

presented in the petition, and it was not raised in the

22

cross-petition, and in our view it is not properly before

23

the Court.

MR. SMITH:

Very well.
Nevertheless, we realize the Court

may elect to reach it, so we have briefed the matter in

2

our reply brief.
I was going to start with the allocation issue

3
4

first.

Under this Court's Evansville decision, airport

5

fees must, in the first instance, be based on what the

6

Court called "some fair approximation of use," and as the

7

Solicitor General points out in his brief at page 7, this

8

means that the fee should not be higher than the airline's

9

properly allocated costs, but in our view, this airport

10

has not even attempted to comply with this requirement.
As the Court knows, at this airport, as at most,

11
12

there are two main groups of users.

13

airlines on the one hand, and the concessions on the

14

other.

15

significantly from costs that the airport expends on what

16

are called the air operations costs, and the reason for

17

that is, without the airport spending money on taking and

18

landing -- takeoff and landing facilities, there would be

19

no customers, either for the airlines or for the

20

concessions, and for that reason, in our view, in order to

21

fairly approximate the use, the airport was required to

22

allocate at least some of the costs to the concessions,

23

but they did not do so.

24
25

There are the

Both of these two groups of users benefit

They allocated none of the costs to the
concessions, and the result necessarily was, and

mathematically so, as Judge Flaum found in the

2

Indianapolis decision, the fair share of the costs to the

3

airlines was too high.

QUESTION:

They were in fact paying more than

Mr. Smith, how many other Federal

6

statutes are there that confer ratemaking responsibilities

7

upon Federal courts?

8

you're asking us to engage in here, isn't it, the whole

9

process of ratemaking?

10

MR. SMITH:

11

QUESTION:

I mean, that is essentially what

I think not, Your Honor.
You're saying what you're entitled to

12

are reasonable rates, which are going to be determined by

13

Federal courts.

14

that.

15

I know one Federal statute that requires

I don't know any others.
MR. SMITH:

I think the court is often in the

16

business of determining whether or not impositions made by

17

a State in the form of user fees are reasonable.

18

all, Evansville was a Commerce Clause decision, and we

19

believe when Congress adopted the AHTA it essentially

20

adopted in part the Evansville requirements, and the Court

21

has often decided other cases where reasonableness in that

22

context was required to be decided.

QUESTION:

intended that -QUESTION:

5

In normal ratemaking, you're allowed

6

a fair return on your capital.

7

MR. SMITH:

Why isn't that reasonable?

Not under the AHTA, Your Honor,

8

because under the AHTA Congress recognized that the vast

9

bulk of the revenues that fund airports are going to come

10

from the Federal Government through taxes paid by

11

passengers, and Congress wanted no further additional fees

12

to be imposed on users of airports except those that would

13

be absolutely --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SMITH:

16

-- necessary to keep -- and to keep

the airport self-sustaining.
QUESTION:

17
18

But the reason --

That's the word in 2210.

So you'd allow depreciation, would

you?

19

MR. SMITH:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

20

QUESTION:

Is depreciation absolutely necessary?

21

MR. SMITH:

They can recover their costs, Your

22

Honor, and to the extent they had costs that they had to

23

expend to purchase assets to serve users.

recover their costs, but --

2

MR. SMITH:

I think they can, Your Honor, so

3

long as they are costs absolutely necessary for additional

4

assets or for replacement of assets.

5

QUESTION:

Well, the airport is saying here, you

6

know, we're facing construction fees on reasonable

7

projections of -- you know, multiple millions of dollars,

8

so there's nothing for example, terribly impressive about

9

this surplus of $9 million, if they could anticipate

10

future expense to that extent in, as you put it,

11

recovering their costs.

12

to, in effect, put the same amount of money aside calling

13

it a surplus?

Why is it wrong for them simply

Because, Your Honor, here they

I thought it all was, basically.
No, Your Honor -I mean, the reason they have a

surplus is the payments from the concessioners.
MR. SMITH:

No, Your Honor, that isn't so,

11

because if they had fairly allocated costs at this airport

12

it would then have become apparent that the surpluses are

13

coming from the airlines, and if they hadn't attempted to

14

recover their assets two and three times over through this

No, Your Honor.

11

In order to avoid the violation of

MR. SMITH:

12

In our view, Your Honor, the

reasonableness of requirement of AHTA must be read in

14

light of the AAIA, and its requirements that the airport

only earn enough to be self-sustaining but not so much as

1

No, the principal case, Your Honor,

Why go back to the legislative history?

MR. SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, the meaning of the

word that's here at issue is the word "reasonable" in the

AHTA, and we believe that the Court should interpret the

16

meaning of the word "reasonable" in light of the very

was to strengthen the requirements of Evansville, and if

This airport, when asked to explain surplus in

But you're using a case that was --

in which the airport succeeded in retaining its charges,

Wasn't that the case in Evansville?

No.

In fact, Your Honor, the

The airport won the case, and you're

using that case to say, but in this case the airport

20

MR. SMITH:

Yes, because the Congress said in

letting the airport win, the Court didn't apply as strict

QUESTION:

And in any event, no effort was made

here to go administratively.
MR. SMITH:

None was

17

made in part because Congress, when it adopted the AHTA,

18

didn't give any authorities directly to the Secretary to

19

act in this area at all, and in fact the Secretary to our

knowledge had very little experience or expertise in

21

determining the reasonableness of fees.

MR. SMITH:

I believe so, Your Honor.

Only one,

2

and I believe it's from Massport, the Logan Airport case,

3

and of course, that case came in 1988-1989, which was some

4

15 or 16 years after the AHTA was adopted, and at the time

5

it was adopted, to my knowledge there had been no cases in

6

which the Secretary had actually reviewed the

7

reasonableness of fees.

8

9

QUESTION:

In your view, does the Secretary have

the authority to make any more refined or precise

10

allocations than does a court when you bring an action

11

before the court rather than the agency?

12

MR. SMITH:

He may, Your Honor, but the very

13

policies that the Solicitor General describes that are the

14

views of the Secretary are very much our own.

15

although he opposes them from --

16

QUESTION:

I mean,

From your standpoint, a court can do

17

whatever the agency can do, and vice versa, in this area

18

of allocating?

19

MR. SMITH:

Perhaps not, Your Honor.

What we're

20

asking you to do here is simply apply the bright line test

21

of Evansville, and because we think all three of those

22

bright line tests --

The point of my question is, is to

You can have the same standards, but

if you turn them over to 93 different district courts to

than if you have one administrative agency applying them.

7

MR. SMITH:

I would suggest not, Your Honor.

8

The difference between the Sixth and Seventh Circuits that

9

are now before the Court are fundamental differences about

10

how to apply the Evansville standards, and if both parties

11

had gone to the Secretary first in those two cases, there

12

still would have been an appeal available to the circuit

have had a difference of opinion about what the meaning is

MR. SMITH:

Isn't that the focus?
That is true, Your Honor, and we

16

believe, in fact, we have an excessive burden on

interstate commerce in this case for the reason that I've

said, because we have an airport not fairly allocating its

the Court knows, the concession fees here are paid for by

the passengers.

3

So once again the end result is that the total

fees being extracted by this airport from the airlines and

their passengers are vastly in excess of this airport's

cost of delivering services to those users, and that is

the precise thing that Congress intended to prohibit in

9

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me that your

argument is valid under the standard, conventional

Commerce Clause analysis if you show a discrimination

between general aviation and the commercial aviation, but

when you then have the concessions, and you start

balancing revenues, it seems to me that's a very strange

offhand, but I don't see anything in this record that

tells us that the general aviation category is intrastate.

3

MR. SMITH:

There was not explicit evidence on

4

that issue, Your Honor, you're right about that, and the

5

reason there was not was because the district judge

6

dismissed our Commerce Clause claim at the beginning, and

7

if we prevail here that we were entitled to have at least

8

raised a Commerce Clause contention, we believe we would

be entitled on remand to adduce the kind of evidence that

QUESTION:

What was the basis for the district

MR. SMITH:

We think the Congress assumed, or

intended, that these issues would be dealt with primarily

by the Secretary, and -- for instance, we believe that a

State court faced with this issue might very well say one

12

of two things, either that it would defer to the

Secretary's determination of reasonableness, to the extent

that was the issue, or that it would simply refuse to hold

So at least it's an open question in

your mind as to whether or not, in a State court action,

the anti-head-tax statute is valid Federal defense.
MR. DuMONT:

10

We think that's an open question,

yes, and we also think that, as I said, it arises no

12

matter what the decision is on the private right question,

13

and that the question should be looked at independently.

14

For instance, there are cases this court has looked at --

15

for instance, the second Pennhurst decision, which quite

16

clearly state the view that whether or not a Federal issue

consequence that may be accepted.

quite appropriate for an airline to pay this tax under

protest and then either sue for a refund or, for instance,

go straight to the Secretary at that point, having paid

the tax, and ask the Secretary to entertain a

5

reasonableness challenge.

6

If the Secretary finds that he has the authority

to do that and that the fees are unreasonable, then we

think the Secretary would have the authority to issue

requiring a refund of those fees.
QUESTION:

MR. DuMONT:

prior right of action would undercut the logical basis for

the remand, the remand would remain the law of the case

MR. DuMONT:

Assuming the parties are not able

to resolve that issue amicably in light of this Court's

those same reasons the jurisdictional question would not

the rest of the district court's authority with respect to

QUESTION:

So there's really no law on this

issue about whether a surplus can sometimes be too large,

or something,

MR. DuMONT:

There is no decisional law on that

or

1

without the necessity to resort to a former adversarial

2

proceeding before the Secretary.

3

Because none of the statutes involved here

4

confers an explicit private right, we have to look to

5

Congress' intent, and it is the petitioner's burden to

6

persuade the Court that Congress, with the single word

7

"reasonable" in section 1513(b), whose major function,

8

after all, is merely to make clear that the head-tax

9

prohibition of section 1513(a) does not apply to user

10

fees, petitioners must rely on that one word "reasonable"

11

to engage the district courts all over the country in what

12

is essentially a ratemaking proceeding, and we think that

13

quite clearly contravenes the intent of Congress in

14

placing the Anti-Head-Tax Act in the Federal Aviation Act,

15

which provides quite a comprehensive remedial scheme.

16

In the FAA, section 1354, which is reprinted on

17

page 6a of our brief, provides broad general powers to the

18

Secretary, section 1482 makes it clear that any person may

19

file a complaint raising any sort of issue within the

20

jurisdiction of the FAA -- I might point out, for

21

instance, that my colleague, Mr. Smith, on behalf of many

22

of the same airlines who are involved in this proceeding,

has filed such a complaint last Wednesday with respect to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. HUNTING, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

5

7

MR. HUNTING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There is no precedent of this Court that

8

mandates that a local governmental unit as owner and

9

landlord must lease its facilities to a commercial tenant

10

at rates that are less than the acquisition cost of the

11

facilities so provided.

12

Likewise, there is no precedent of this Court

13

that requires an airport to adjust its rates to one tenant

14

based upon the varying business results of yet another

15

different category of tenant.

16

issue in this case are very simply landing fees and

17

terminal rental rates, which clearly are permitted under

18

the clarification language of section 1513(b) of the Anti-

19

Head-Tax Act.

20

The traditional fees at

These charges being landing fees and terminal

21

rental rates, are not direct or indirect taxes or illegal

could explain further -QUESTION:

2

You agree that no matter what happens

3

here, you've lost on that, and the district court should,

4

on remand, decide that issue as though there is a private

5

right of action.
MR. HUNTING:

6

Yes, but I need to define loss.

7

All the Sixth Circuit said was, it was inappropriate to

8

allocate 100 percent of CFR costs to the commercial

9

airlines.

10

QUESTION:

Right.

11

MR. HUNTING:

We did not appeal that decision.

12

We do expect, depending on whether the remand holds up and

13

whether they're amicable proceedings or not, to litigate

14

before the district judge what percent less than

15

100 percent would be appropriate.

16

QUESTION:

And will not interpose the absence of

17

any private right of action even if that were to be the

conclusion of this Court.

relates to needs for cross-petition, and in particular I

25

proposition that this Court can address that issue.

2

to defer it to the agency, under any one of those somewhat

3

similar scenarios it would go to the agency, and we would

then expect to abide by whatever the agency decision was

on the allocation of CFR costs that are imposed under FAA

rules and regulations.

MR. HUNTING:

Well,

I think in a sense that all

12

the Sixth Circuit decided was that it could not be

100 percent allocation to the commercial airlines,

14

would submit to this Court that the agency would at least

15

be bound by the narrow decision and the law of the case as

16

it relates to this particular action, that the CFR costs

17

could not in fact be 100-percent allocated to the

18

commercial airlines.

MR. HUNTING:

1

I will be candid to acknowledge

2

that it's with some reluctance that -- having prevailed at

3

the lower court that we've raised the issue, but we raised

4

the issue at the trial court level dealing with the

5

private cause of action as well as exhaustion of

6

administrative remedies and other related concepts of

7

deference to primary jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

8

9

No, but you did not cross-petition on

it.
MR. HUNTING:

10

We did not cross-petition, and we

are not seeking to expand relief that could be obtained by

12

the airport or relief that would be detrimental to the

airlines.

might happen.

I am authorized to make that representation to

I would like to address briefly the three bright

17

line tests, as Mr. Smith has called them, of the

18

Interstate Commerce Clause test in the Evansville case.

19

This airport does not retreat from any kind of analysis of

20

the merits of its methodology and the results of its

21

methodology.

22

First, the charges must reflect a fair

23

approximation of the use of the airport facilities from

24

which the airlines do benefit.

25

would appear that could mean one, two, or three things,

In very simple terms, it

41

1

either that the user charged must receive some benefit

2

from the item for which the user is charged.

3

pass that test, and to the extent that is a subpart, we

4

agree.

5

We certainly

To the extent that the benefit may mean that an

6

airport cannot goldplate its facilities -- for instance,

7

to have Vermont marble on the ticket countertops or

8

oriental rugs on the floor, we agree that benefit can mean

9

that.

10

What we would suggest that is the critical issue

11

in this case, whether it be viewed under the Evansville

12

standard or any other standard, is a serious warping by

13

the airlines of what benefit means when they suggest that

14

somehow an airport in determining its charges to one

15

tenant must look, either by cross-credit or by change in

16

cost allocation to the varying benefit that yet a

17

different category of tenant might receive from its

18

business results.

19

We suggest that there is no precedent of this

20

Court in any airport or other local governmental setting

21

that would require that a local government as owner and

22

landlord engage in such an evaluation of benefits.

23

With reference to benefits, I would point out

24

very simply that the district court found in unchallenged

25

fashion that the totality of all airport charges,
42

1

including the reduced overnight aircraft parking fee and

2

including 100 percent of CFR, constituted only

3

1-1/2 percent of the gross revenues received by the

4

airlines at this particular airport.

5

The second, and I think the simplest of the so-

6

called Evansville bright line tests, are that the airport

7

charges may not be excessive in relation to incurred

8

costs.

9

district court found as a specific critical finding of

In that regard, I would point out that the

10

fact that only break-even costs as defined under the

11

methodology and as shown under the evidence were charged

12

to the airlines and as such I think that automatically

13

satisfies the second charge.

14

And certainly I would indicate further that the

15

Solicitor General has indicated that there is a reasonable

16

latitude even above the incurrence and the allocation of

17

actual costs and clearly that has been satisfied in this

18

case.

19

The third criteria of Evansville is that the

20

charge does not discriminate against interstate travel,

21

and I would point out first that general aviation and the

22

airlines are not in the same category of tenant under the

23

Airport and Airway Improvement Act or under any other

24

analysis that might be applied.

I would -QUESTION:

Apart from that, is there a reason

why the break was given to general aviation?
MR. HUNTING:

There are several reasons.

The

5

economy of collection, which is a quotation from a portion

6

of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act, certainly

7

indicates that as to general aviation flights that are

8

unscheduled it is very difficult, when they land without

9

prior notice at an airport such as ours, to be able to

10

apply a standard landing fee, and then to have a separate

11

billing and to know where that billing should be sent.

12

And consequently this airport and, as the

13

testimony indicates, other airports have gone to different

14

means, which traditionally have included hangar fees, tie­

15

down charges, and more often, also in accordance with the

16

Airport and Airway Improvement Act, so-called fuel flowage

17

charges on the gasoline sold by a local airport to those

18

general aviation entities who may land there, or land

19

there and stay there, and it is in that respect that the

20

airport has chosen to approach the collection.

21

QUESTION:

Do I understand you to be arguing it

22

would be too difficult to collect a landing fee from a

23

private aircraft?

24
25

MR. HUNTING:

No.

I'm saying that with the

commercial airlines, at this airport and most airports,

there are predicted scheduled flights.
QUESTION:

2

I understand that, but then I thought

3

you went on to say because you don't know what the

4

schedule is you couldn't collect a uniform fee from the

these are not scheduled landings.

fees are not under the airport -- excuse me, under the

12

Anti-Head-Tax Act, and when you couple the finding of the

13

district court that the airline charges did not in any way

contribute to the surplus, I think that this becomes more

of what the Court properly recognized as a lack of

the Court that the Anti-Head-Tax Act in its legislative

history demonstrated no indication that concession

revenues should at all be addressed by that statute.
The legislative history indicates that in fact

2

3

Congress was aware that certain airports were in fact

4

generating profits or accumulating surpluses.

5

bottom-line analysis when looking at the statutes and the

6

legislative history is that Congress chose to regulate the

mandatory air side aspects of an airport and chose not to

regulate the discretionary purchase concession side of the

airports.

MR. HUNTING:

I -- there certainly could be a

mandatory aspect of the question you ask, but I do not

7

believe that the charge for that facility is covered by

8

the Anti-Head-Tax Act, and I would suggest, Your Honor,

9

that perhaps the simplest analysis of whether concessions

10

are included in section 1513(a) of the Anti-Head-Tax Act

11

is to analyze the argument of the airlines.

12

concessions are included in section (a), and they claim

13

that section (b) is a so-called savings clause.

14

They claim

If both of those premises are true, it is clear

15

that section 1513(b) did not save concession charges as

16

being illegal under 1513(a), which would leave you with

17

the absurd and I think illogical result that all

18

concession charges at the airport would be illegal, and I

19

suggest that that simple analysis is perhaps the easiest

20

way to approach the very important issue here as to

21

whether concession revenues are at all addressed by or

22

regulated by the Anti-Head-Tax Act.

23

And we suggest that there is no such regulation,

24

that Congress has simply chosen to regulate the mandatory

side of airports through, initially, the Airport and

leave all this to the Secretary, but the strange

8

phenomenon is that the Secretary's had only one case

9

involving this legislation, and there are very major

10

issues such as the one we're just talking about, about

11

whether, you know, concession fees are included, and so

12

forth.

13

yet he hasn't done anything?

14

How can it be that it's really his bailiwick and

MR. HUNTING:

I would suggest something that I

15

think is outside the record, but yet I think is certainly

16

known, and that is that in many instances with other

17

airports there have been leases that could be of duration,

18

10, 20, or 30 years, so that these charges have been

19

established in one form or another by negotiated leases

20

that cover long periods of time.

21

Consequently, much of the period of time that

22

would have been taken care of in the seventies and

23

eighties were, I think, at many airports covered by leases

24

of very long duration, and I think that to that extent the

25

issue is now percolating I think to a greater extent than

it has before.
But I would suggest to the Court that in the

2

3

very complex situation of the Massport case that the

4

agency in fact did choose to entertain a complaint by a

5

general aviation entity, chose to intervene in the other

6

proceedings, and continued with an active role throughout

7

all of that, and it was in fact the Massport proceeding

8

that caused this airport to raise the affirmative defenses

9

when it did in late December of '89 and early January of

10
11

1990 .
And if I could address I think several questions

12

that came from the Court, the dismissal by district court

13

Judge Bell of the interstate commerce case was not solely

14

on issues of law.

15

I hesitate to be before this Court and talking

16

about answers to interrogatories and discovery, but the

17

airport filed a combined motion under Rule 56 for summary

18

judgment and 12(b)(6), and for the combined reasons of no

19

factual proofs either to support an interstate commerce

20

claim or, perhaps more importantly, to distinguish that

21

claim from an Airport and Airway Improvement Act claim, or

22

an Anti-Head-Tax Act claim, relying on that absence of

23

factual proof and the rationale of the Merrion case, the

24

district court so ruled.

25

And I would point out to the Court that the

Sixth Circuit observed the nature of that ruling on pages

2

30 and 31 of its opinion, commenting that there was a

3

factual aspect and lack of proof as well as to legal, and

4

we stand here today, even without the absence of proof

that in my judgment would indicate any violation of the

Interstate Commerce Clause.

QUESTION:

Are you then taking issue with

as affirmed by the Sixth Circuit, and the Sixth Circuit

noted the contentions of the airport on page 30 and 31 of

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER A. SMITH, JR.

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

16

MR. SMITH:

Thank you, Your Honor.

17

First of all, at page 46-A of the appendix to

18

the cert petition is where the district court quite

19

clearly dismissed our Commerce Clause claim solely on the

20

ground that Congress had taken action in the area.

21

Second, with regard to Justice Scalia's question

22

about whether or not concessions are covered by the AHTA,

23

we take the view that whether or not they are covered,

24

whereas here the concession fees are being paid ultimately

25

by the passengers, the right reasoning is the one that

1

Judge Posner used in Indianapolis, and that is to say that

2

whereas here the total fees being imposed on the airlines

3

and their passengers through this fee methodology vastly

4

exceed the airport's costs, that is precisely what

5

Congress intended to prohibit in the AHTA.
And finally, let me address Mr. DuMont's point

6

7

that we are relying only on the word "reasonable" in 1513

8

on the merits of the private right of action issue.

9

is not true at all, as we explained in our brief, but most

That

10

importantly, whereas here Congress was intending to

11

strengthen the prohibitions of Evansville, a case in which

12

a right of action by the airlines had been recognized, it

13

would be perverse to suppose that Congress was there by
sub silentio taking away the most effective way of

15

carrying out the indications in the AHTA of what the

16

Congress wanted to achieve, and that, to us, is grounds

17

enough alone to find we ought to win the private right of

18

action issue even if the Court reaches it.

19

Finally, I would mention that even if

20

Mr. Hunting is kind enough to give away the CFR issue, if

21

this Court reaches the private right of action issue, it

22

will have to modify the judgment below, and under this

23

Court's precedents the Court is not permitted to do that,

24

whereas here, Mr. Hunting elected not to file a cross­

25

petition .
