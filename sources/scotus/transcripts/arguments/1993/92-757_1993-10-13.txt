ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. SCHNAPPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:

12

The question here is whether sections 101 and

13

102 of the 1991 Civil Rights Act apply to the claims in

14

these cases, both of which arose prior to November 21st,

15

1991, the effective date of the Civil Rights Act.

16

With regard to Rivers, the practical question is

17

whether in the future this and other section 1981 cases

18

which arose before -- prior to November 1991 will be

19

governed by section 101 of the '91 act or by this Court's

20

1989 decision in Patterson, which the Civil Rights Act

21

overturned.

22

23
24
25

With regard to Landgraf, the practical
question -QUESTION:

I don't think that the Civil Rights

overturned our decision.

It simply recognized that

Congress had passed a statute which was broken and that it

2

ought to be fixed.

3

MR. SCHNAPPER:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. SCHNAPPER:

6

I --

It's a very fundamental distinction.
Well, I'll accept your

characterization of it.

7

With regard to Landgraf, the practical question

8

is whether plaintiffs who are injured by intentional acts

9

of discrimination occurring prior to November, 1991 can

10

obtain the additional remedies provided by section 102.

11

If section 102 is not available, then petitioner Landgraf,

12

who has established that she was the victim of intentional

13

discrimination, will have no remedy whatsoever.

14
15
16
17
18

There are two distinct reasons why we maintain
that section 101 and 102 -QUESTION:

In one of the two cases, Mr.

Schnapper, the right to jury trial is involved, isn't it?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

If section 102 applies, then

19

either party could request a jury trial, that's right.

20

And so that's raised in the Landgraf case.

21

QUESTION:

In Landgraf, right.

22

QUESTION:

That right to jury trial is

23
24
25

inseparable from the substantive right to damages.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

That's right, that's right.

It's only if there's a right to damages that the right to

1

jury trial is available to either side.

2

distinct -QUESTION:

3

There are two

And on that point, if the plaintiff

4

prevailed there would have to be an entire new trial,

5

because the defendant also would have a right to jury

6

trial.

7

Is that not so?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

We don't believe so, Your Honor.

8

The bench trial that was conducted prior to the adoption

9

of the Civil Rights Act established liability, and we

10

believe that under the reasoning of this Court's decision

11

in Park Lane Hosiery, that estoppel by judgment precludes

12

either side --

13

QUESTION:

How could there be estoppel when the

14

defendant succeeded -- won the judgment.

15

from an adverse portion of an opinion if the judgment is

16

in your favor.

17

position to appeal the judgment in defendant's favor, then

18

in fairness, must be able to have a whole new trial.

19

You can't appeal

Defendant, in that case, not being in a

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Your Honor, in the Landgraf case

20

the judgment was in the plaintiff's favor.

21

judge found that there had -- that there was a pattern of

22

sexual harassment and the defendant could have cross

23

appealed on that issue.

24
25

QUESTION:

The district

That was not the -- what was the

ultimate judgment in the district court?

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

I do not think

1

there was a judgment entered for the plaintiff, was there?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

2

There wasn't -- there wasn't

3

judgment entered for the plaintiff.

4

had been a violation of the law and -QUESTION:

5

The court found there

Yeah, and one appeals from a

6

judgment, not from an opinion and not from a finding.

You

7

can't appeal -- if you win the judgment, as far as I

8

understand it, you can't appeal from an adverse finding

9

made along the way.

The judgment winner can't appeal even

10

though there was a finding --an intermediate finding

11

against the judgment winner, isn't that correct?

12

appeal from a judgment, not from an opinion and not from a

13

finding.

14

MR. SCHNAPPER:

You

I believe, Your Honor, that --

15

that when we were in the court of appeals arguing that

16

even prior to the Civil Rights Act we were entitled to

17

greater relief, the defendants could have argued that we

18

were not entitled to any relief because the decision as to

19

liability was incorrect.

20

could be addressed on remand.

21

QUESTION:

There is the further point --

22

QUESTION:

It's a fairly important issue.

And, in any event, that issue

It

23

seems to me you wouldn't have to come down with an all or

24

25

wrongs, alleged wrongs occurred.

2

place that would be a more appropriate place to divide the

effectiveness.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

4

We view the matter differently,

5

Mr. Chief Justice.

6

question of what the remedy should be was in dispute,

7

which it was at the time the act was adopted, that the

8

plaintiff ought to be able to invoke the statute.
QUESTION:

9

Our view is that as long as the

Well, what if Congress had done just

10

the opposite of what it did here?

11

most recent act there had been a right to jury trial and

12

afterwards the Congress says no, there's no longer a jury

13

trial, and the plaintiff had already had a jury trial in

14

which she'd been awarded damages, would you say then that

15

under -- the new act would apply and the jury trial would

16

be cancelled out?

17

MR. SCHNAPPER:

No.

Supposing before the

No, our view is that so

18

long as the right manner of trial - - the manner of trial

19

was correct under the law as it stood at the time of the

20

trial, that that isn't -- that that method of trying a

21

case doesn't -- isn't reopened.

both ways.

But you are claiming you should go

back and be able to have a jury trial?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

Oh, we're claiming we have a

If we are allowed to do that, either party could

QUESTION:

But it would all -- the

Which they wouldn't have done before

the act was amended.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

Right.

But the issue to be

11

tried on remand is not going to be liability, it's going

12

to be damages, which is an issue that was not tried at all

13

the first time around.

14

QUESTION:

And you don't recognize the defend --

15

that a defendant would have an argument, well, I'm

16

entitled to a jury trial too.

17

would bifurcate liability and damages, because the two

18

are -- often intertwine.

19

MR. SCHNAPPER:

And it isn't often that you

Well, it has, however, happened.

20

This is, in effect, what happened in Park Lane Hosiery

21

where there was one proceeding properly before a judge in

22

which liability was established and then subsequent

23

proceedings invoked that judgment.

24
25

QUESTION:

Yeah.

Well, there was no judgment.

There was never a judgment for the plaintiff in this case.

The court of appeals affirmed a district court judgment

for the defendant, and that's quite different from what

was involved in Park Lane.

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, we view the matter

differently.

Do you have any authority for a - - an

appeal from a favorable decision, where a party is allowed

to appeal from a favorable decision?

precise circumstance has arisen.
QUESTION:

But I'm not aware of any such authority.

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, let me also say that it's

14

not necessary at -- in this case and in this present

15

posture, for this Court to address that collateral

16

judgment by estoppel issue.

17

with on remand.

18

statute can be invoked at all.

19

which requires resolution here.

20

We think that could be dealt

The broader question here is whether the
I think that's the issue

The linchpin of our argument regarding the

21

structure and language of the statute is the fact that

22

there are two expressly prospective provisions in the act.

23

Section 109 (c), with regard to extraterritoriality,

24

provides that that section will not apply to conduct

25

occurring prior to the effective date of the statute.

(800) FOR DEPO

If

1

petitioner Landgraf had worked for USI in Mexico she could

2

not invoke the statute.

3

in this instance respondent USI can't invoke section

4

109(c) because the petitioner worked in a plant in Texas.

5

Section 109(c) would apply.

But

Similarly, there is a second expressly

6

prospective position -- provision in the statute, section

7

402(b), which expressly exempts from any application of

8

the act any preexisting case that meets three

9

requirements:

that it was filed before 1975; that the

10

first decision in the case happened after March of 1983;

11

and that it's a disparate impact case.
QUESTION:

12

13

so far as you know, to only one possible party?

14
15

Do you agree that that applies to - -

MR. SCHNAPPER:

That was the understanding of

Congress and that's our understanding.

16

In this -- in this case, Rivers' and Landgraf's

17

case meet the second requirement of section 402(b) but

18

don't meet the first or the third requirement.

19

Because neither of the expressly prospective

20

provisions are available to respondents, this case is

21

governed by section 402(a).

22

section 109(c) and 402(b) are dispositive of the meaning

23

of section 402(a).

24

established rules of construction which we think apply

25

here.

It's our contention that

There are a number of different, well

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Yeah.
But we have other provisions in

the statute, and here, as in --

was the language take effect upon enactment, we would not

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, we also --

-- for the meaning of the 402(a).
Yes.

But we also rely on the

19

language of section 402(a) which begins:

20

21

reference of that clause, we think, is section 402(b) and

22

109(c).

23

ordinary meaning of the phrase "except as otherwise

24

provided" is that 402(a) is different than those

25

exceptions.

section 402(a).
As I was saying, there are a number of well

established rules of construction which we contend apply

4

here.

5

alterius, the rule in Russello, that where a provision

6

such as 109(c) is in one section of a statute but not

7

another, that that decision was deliberate.

8

9

The rule that expressio unius est exclusio

We've noted in our arguments that if the view of
respondent were accepted that 402(a) means that the

10

statute is applicable to any preexisting claim, then

11

section 402(b) would be entirely redundant, as would

12

section 109(c).

13

effect of giving independent significance and force to all

14

provisions of the statute.

15

The construction which we advance has the

QUESTION:

There is some redundancy in this --

16

in this act.

17

402(a), so it isn't the most carefully drafted piece of

18

legislation.

19

sentence in 110(b) as there is in 402(a), is there?

20

110(b) says exactly the same thing as

There's no reason to have this -- the same

MR. SCHNAPPER:

We agree, Your Honor, that --

21

the maxim is where it's possible to avoid redundancy, the

22

court should interpret the act to do so.

23

possible with regard to section 110.

24

exactly the same as 402(a).

25

construe 402(a) in a manner which doesn't render 402(b)

QUESTION:

2

Mr. Schnapper, there -- now, there

3

are a lot of maxims of construction and it's not unusual

4

for the maxims to cut against one another, and in those

5

cases I guess you have to decide which one is stronger.

6

Now, I had thought that we have a very strong rule -- I'm

7

not even sure it's -- it's at as low a level as a maxim of

8

construction, but a rule that retroactivity is disfavored.

9

I mean, we have some State constitutions that specifically

prohibit retroactive legislation.

11

of the common law.

It's a long tradition

Why shouldn't we say, well, in an ordinary case

12

13

these minor indications of meaning would suffice, but they

14

don't suffice to overcome the strong presumption against

15

retroactive legislation, you have to say it clearly?

16

MR. SCHNAPPER:

QUESTION:

18

Well --

You wouldn't say this is clear, would

you?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, I wouldn't -- well, I

would, Your Honor.

This is as -- this structural argument

21

we advance here is the same as the argument the Court

22

accepted in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas, that -- where there

were exceptions in that case specifically providing that

24

States were liable for certain things, the Court concluded

that that was - - that meant the extraordinarily stringent

So I think without

GENERAL DAYS:

That's correct.

And what we've

10

offered in our brief is a variety of alternatives that the

11

Court might consider in terms of how a trial on remand

12

might be handled by the lower court.

13

I wanted to pick up on my colleague, Mr.

14

Schnapper's argument about the Bradley, Bennett, Bowen

15

rules, that he began to discuss.

16

argued in our brief that the language structure analysis

17

that he provided to the Court provides a reasonable

18

inference that Congress intended for the act, with the

19

exception of 402(b) and 109(c), to apply to pending cases.

20

But to the extent that the Court finds

21

difficulty with that, we think that there is one inference

22

that certainly can be drawn from that language and

23

structure analysis, and that is that Congress intended

24

that at least some of the provisions of the 1991 act would

25

have applicability to pending cases.

As he indicated, we have

1

language points in the direction of some applicability to

2

pending cases.

3

What that directive provides is an invitation

4

for courts to evaluate the remaining provisions of the act

5

against a backdrop of jurisprudence having to do with

6

default rules in those instances where it is not clear

7

whether certain provisions should be applied to pending

cases or not to pending cases.

are mutually reinforcing.
QUESTION:

11

How would you apply that rule, Mr.

Days, in the hypothetical case, not this statute, where

13

the jury trial provisions are not linked to the damages?

14

Suppose you have a trial in which the damages are assessed

15

by the court and then, pending appeal, the jury trial

16

provision is enacted?

17

that case?

18

for a new trial before a jury?

19

How would you apply your rule in

Would the plaintiff be entitled to reversal

GENERAL DAYS:

We would regard the right to a

20

jury trial as a procedural right, and under normal

21

circumstances that would require a jury trial.

22

would also suggest, as we said in our brief, that where a

23

trial has occurred and it is an error-free trial even

24

without a jury, there would be no requirement for a trial

25

before a jury to the extent that the new rule applied.

Yes, it does.

Certainly, the

MR. NAGER:

It was a heavily debated issue, no

MR. NAGER:

The panel there took the position

that Congress had not only addressed it but the language

by Mr. Schnapper that it becomes a plain language case.

20

MR. NAGER:

That is what the court in Reynolds

21

held, and, of course, it was wrong.

And the reason it was

wrong is because it started in the wrong place.

Well, do we -- do we get to

And -MR. NAGER:

Yes, Justice Souter, I think we do.

Ever since Schooner Peggy the Court has instructed the

court should struggle hard to avoid retroactive

7

interpretations of the law, that the presumption of

prospectivity protects fundamental values of justice and

fundamental to this Nation's legal tradition and to its

constitutional structure.

Well, in our struggle how do we read

out the negative implication of 109(c)?
MR. NAGER:

I don't think it's a question of

15

reading it out, Justice Souter.

There's no doubt that

16

there is a plausible inference from those sections that

17

one plausible construction of 402(a) is that Congress

18

intended it to apply some of the provisions of the Civil

19

Rights Act retroactively, but it's not the only

20

conceivable inference.

21

And the important question that the Court has to

22

ask is what standard of clarity does Congress have to meet

23

in order to compel the courts to do what this Court has

24

historically instructed the courts to not do, to not apply

25

a statute retroactively.

me that it's plausible for you to make a distinction

compass and does not seem to be a bizarre example.

13

MR. NAGER:

I think the Justice is correct in

that the two provisions are different.

3

That's what section 109(c) becomes applicable to.

can't ignore either the presumption that I've discussed or

the language of 402(a) itself.

6

and it elicits - -,

QUESTION:

But we

That language is ambiguous

Well, I would grant you that in the

8

absence of (c) it certainly would be ambiguous, but it is

9

also very clear, as your brother pointed out, that it

10

begins by referring to an exception so that it seems to

11

have been drafted with just such an exception as 109(c) in

12

mind, which seems to me, if anything, to underline the

13

implication of (c). It seems to me a strong implication.

14

MR. NAGER:

Well, in - - the Justice has agreed

15

with me that section 402(b) prohibits both retroactive and

16

prospective effects, so to the extent that 402(a) starts

17

with except -- with a qualification on its language, it

18

easily picks up 402(b) without making any reference one

19

way or the other as to whether or not 402(a) is only a

20

prospectivity provision or a retroactivity provision as

21

well as a prospectivity provision.

22

The important point here is twofold.

One is

23

that the language of 402(a) is language that Congress has

24

used before.

construed by the lower courts as allowing only prospective

1

Well, there are cases from this

Court dealing, quite frankly, with much more complicated

3

and difficult cases.

4

case in which Congress had passed a transfer tax under the

5

estate tax laws saying that in any transaction whatsoever

6

that a transfer tax would be placed on that transaction,

7

so that a person before their death couldn't reduce the

8

size of their estate.

For example, Schwab v. Doyle is a

9

And this Court said that while certainly it was

10

one plausible construction of that statute to say that it

11

applied to any transaction that an individual had entered

12

into before their death to reduce the size of their

13

estate -- this Court said it is possible to read the

14

statute to only apply to transactions occurring after the

15

date of enactment and before an individual's death, and

16

that the transfer tax would only apply to those

17

reductions -- transactions which reduced the size of an

18

individual's estate.

In the context of title VII, I think your answer was that

It's the court of appeals ruling that --

That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.
How about the Civil Rights

MR. NAGER:

11

I have to concede to the Justice

12

that I haven't read the language of the Civil Rights

And General Electric v. Gilbert, as the dissent

pointed out, rejected the unanimous views of six court of

appeals and the EEOC's position on whether or not

discrimination on the basis of pregnancy constituted

5

discrimination on the basis of disability.

6

rejected this Court's interpretation as of what the law

should be, enacted a new rule of law that provided for a

8

effective date using general language identical to the

9

general effective date language in this statute.

10

And Congress

And the courts of appeals, applying different

11

methodologies, to be sure, than methodologies that other

courts have applied -- because there is some confusion --

13

a considerable amount of confusion in the courts of

14

appeals as to what methodology to apply given the tension

15

that exists in this Court's cases, as Justice Scalia has

16

pointed out in his concurring opinion in the Majerno case.

statutes containing general effective date language, as

First of all, that statute

of changes.

And secondly, that is -- was a one-shot provision.

And I think -- and you've suggested that one

might read this statute as contemplating retroactivity for

some of the changes, such as the expert witness fee

provision and such as the attack on consent decrees.
MR. NAGER:

10

I'm -- apologies if I have been

11

unclear, Justice Stevens.

12

the Civil Rights Act can in any way properly be construed

13

as having retroactive applications --

14

QUESTION:

I did not mean to suggest that

So your position is there is no

retroactivity, even, for example, on the consent decree

not to future attacks on previously entered consent

like the expert witness fees provision, would apply to any

U.S. citizens overseas, because the alien exemption says

Title VII doesn't apply to aliens who are working

overseas.

5

But as the Court --as Chief Justice Rehnquist

6

pointed out in his opinion for the Court, and as Justice

7

Scalia pointed out in his concurring opinion, that wasn't

8

enough to overcome the presumption for the extra

application against application of U.S. laws overseas.

If

that presumption isn't overcome by negative inferences, it

would certainly seem that this presumption, which

certainly forms the most essential starting point for

and in the House over whether or not changes in the law to

4

The question should be whether

It may be that restorative laws are those kinds

5

of laws in which Congress is going to be more likely on

occasion to make those -- to meet this Court's test.

7

there's no reason to lower the standard just because

Congress may on those occasions rise up and say

historic suspicion of legislatures enacting retroactive

should override the presumption in those particular

QUESTION:

10

Are you saying there's a stronger

11

argument for the retroactivity of the '87 act than of the

12

1991 act?

13

MR. NAGER:

Yes, although I'd reiterate the

14

point that I made to Justice Stevens, that Congress'

15

purpose in restoring the law, while it may provide a

16

suggestion of an intention for retroactivity, is not

17

sufficient to create a retroactive effective date.

18

Congress has to say so clearly.

19

And this was the point of the Tenth Circuit,

20

which is the circuit that I do remember, under the '87

21

statute, which rejected the call for retroactivity of that

22

statute even though it had the benefit of the Second

23

Circuit's views and the Fifth Circuit's views on holding

that statute retroactive.

point for the analysis is we will struggle hard, in the

2

words of the Schooner Peggy Court, to avoid a retroactive

3

application of the law.

4

if the Justice will allow me, I'll let someone else argue

5

the conflict in the circuits under the '87 statute, but my

6

reading of those cases would be that I would be taking the

7

same position if I were arguing that statute, except I

8

can't remember the effective date provisions of that

9

statute well enough.

10

QUESTION:

That's possible here and with --

That presumption that you're

11

referring to, Mr. Nager, I gather is not just an

12

interpretative presumption.

13

presumptions which are just, you know, given no other

14

indication, the normal interpretation is thus and so, this

15

is something of a substantive presumption.

16

MR. NAGER:

It's -- unlike many

I think so, although I'm hesitant

to -- in this particular case, to make distinctions

between substantive presumptions and interpretative

presumptions.

QUESTION:

2

MR. NAGER:

And what else is it?
It is the notion that in this

3

country, with our separation of powers between the

4

legislative branch and the judicial branch and the

5

executive branch, that the power to look backwards to

6

interpret preexisting law and apply preexisting law lies

7

with the courts, and that the presumption with respect to

8

the legislative branch is that it looks forward, not

9

backwards.

10

QUESTION:

Yes, but there's no question here

11

that if Congress had made it's intent clear, it would have

12

had the power to make the statute retroactive.

13

MR. NAGER:

That is true.

But I have to put a

slight qualification on that that I - - we find the

No.

No,

I'm trying to

presumption, whether one calls it a substantive canon as

opposed to an interpretative canon.

7

the historical materials, as I have read this Court's

8

cases,

9

fundamental parts of the American legal tradition.

And as I have read

it's -- it has essentially based it on two

10

The one, as the Justice Stevens pointed out,

11

people are entitled to fair notice of the law, they're

12

entitled to fair notice of its sanctions, and that we will

13

struggle hard to avoid the application to them of any law,

14

of any sanction that they haven't had fair notice of.

15

The second substantive background value that has

16

informed the presumption and given it weight -- and,

17

Justice Stevens, you refer to this yourself in your

18

concurring opinion in the Croson case - - is that we have a

19

suspicion in this country that legislatures can be

vindictive.

MR. NAGER:

I'm not making that argument because

2

I don't think that we need to.

3

to you, Justice Ginsburg.

I have three points to say

4

To the extent that it was illegal to

5

discriminate, either on the basis of race in the Roadway

6

case or to have unlawful sexual harassment in the

7

workplace, the Roadway defendants were vindicated

8

repeatedly in the district court as to not have

9

discriminated on the basis of race.

As the Justices

10

pointed out, the judgment entered in the Landgraf case was

11

a take-nothing judgment against the plaintiff.

12

13

QUESTION:

But there was a finding that the

employer's conduct was in violation of the act.
MR. NAGER:

The finding was that there was

15

sexual harassment occurring in the workplace, but there

16

was also another finding that the employer, USI Film

17

Products, had redressed that situation.

18

the remedy that the 1964 Congress wanted happened.

19

So that, in fact,

The 1964 Congress, in contrast to the 1991

20

Congress, wanted to encourage employers to fix the

21

situations themselves.

But please do remember that the employers in

this case, A, have not been adjudicated of violating any

MR. SCHNAPPER:
