ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY FRENCH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. FRENCH:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The district court's refusal to consider the

10
11

constitutional claims in this case had a profound effect

12

on the sentence that was imposed.

13

prior convictions had not been counted for enhancement,

14

Mr. Custis would have been facing a sentence of 10 years,

15

maximum, in prison.

16

If any one of the three

Counting the three prior convictions increased

17

the statutory maximum from 10 years to life in prison, and

18

also triggered a mandatory minimum penalty of 15 years in

19

prison.

20

imposed was nearly double the statutory maximum that would

21

have been otherwise authorized.

The actual sentence of nearly 20 years that was

The court of appeals recognized that some

22

23

constitutional claims must be considered during sentencing

24

enhancement proceedings under the Armed Career Criminal

25

Act.

The Government also concedes that point.

~T

The issue presented is which constitutional

2

claims should be considered at sentencing enhancement

3

proceedings under the ACCA.

4

violation of the right to effective assistance of counsel

5

in entry of an unknowing and involuntary plea are

6

constitutional errors similar in magnitude to the Gideon

7

violations which this Court has recognized cannot be used

8

to support enhanced punishment.

9

Our position is that

I'd like to cover three points.
QUESTION:

10

First --

Ms. French, to what extent do you

11

think our decisions in Federal habeas, where a State

12

defendant is raising a constitutional claim such as the

13

Boykin type claim, the Parke v. Raley case, to what extent

14

are those either informative or controlling in this

15

context?

16

MS. FRENCH:

I think that some of those cases

17

can be informative.

18

habeas corpus principles would be directly applicable, but

19

there are some principles that might inform the Federal

20

district court's consideration of these challenges.

21

QUESTION:

Generally, I don't believe that the

Do you think this is -- we're dealing

22

here with the question of the intent of Congress, or

23

whether, regardless of congressional intent, it simply

24

couldn't authorize these priors to be considered without

25

having satisfied itself in some way that there was no

constitutional violation in connection with them?
2

MS. FRENCH:

I think our primary argument is

3

that the Constitution requires that these claims be

4

considered.

5

challenges or prohibit challenges, but if you look at the

6

backdrop against which it was enacted, the Federal courts

7

had been allowing challenges for a number of years.

8

9

In terms of the statute, it doesn't authorize

QUESTION:

Well, if you're going to make any

challenge based on statutory construction, really,

10

logically that ought to be your first line.

11

don't reach a constitutional question unless we find it

12

necessary to do so.

13

MS. FRENCH:

We ordinarily

That's true, Your Honor, and our

14

position on the statute is that at the time it was

15

enacted, it was enacted against a backdrop of decisions

16

including this Court's decisions in Burgett v. Texas and

17

United States v. Tucker.

18

We are not arguing that the statute itself

19

authorizes challenges, but we are -- our position is that

20

because of that backdrop, if Congress had wanted to

21

abrogate Federal court review of prior convictions, then

22

it would have made that intent express, and so that is our

23

position on the statute.

24
25

Established principles forbid the imposition of
a mandatory minimum sentence based on prior convictions

1

that are obtained in violation of the Constitution.

2

Court in Burgett v. Texas ruled that a prior uncounseled

3

conviction cannot be used to support guilt of another

4

offense, and the Court's reasoning in Burgett was

5

essentially that to use a conviction in that manner would

6

erode the original constitutional right and would also

7

force the defendant to suffer anew from that violation.
QUESTION:

8

9

This

Do you think that makes much sense,

that line of reasoning?
MS. FRENCH:

10

I think it does, Your Honor,

11

because if you look at the opinion of the court of appeals

12

and of the district court in this case, essentially what

13

those courts held is that it simply does not matter if the

14

defendant -- if the defendant's prior conviction resulted

15

from a constitutional violation, and therefore they would

16

require that the district court ignore any constitutional

17

violations that took place.

18

And so in that sense, doing that would erode the

19

original constitutional right, and in terms of the

20

defendant suffering anew, I think it's clear in this case,

21

because of the direct impact that counting the prior

22

convictions had, that it clearly increased the statutory

23

maximum as well as invoked a mandatory minimum, so for

24

those reasons, that reasoning would apply in this

25

situation.

QUESTION:

1

Ms. French, why isn't it reasonable

2i:i

to say, yes you can attack convictions on the grounds that

3

you're asserting, but you must do so where they are

4

rendered, not concern another forum many years later that

5

doesn't have the record.
Why can't this be regarded as a "where"

6

7

question, not "whether"?

8

on these grounds, but you can do it on direct attack, you

9

can do it on collateral attack in the State where it was

10
11

Yes, you can attack a conviction

rendered.
Why isn't it reasonable for Congress to say, you

12

have those other avenues of attack open, we don't have to

13

give you yet another?

14

MS. FRENCH:

Your Honor, Congress has not

15

actually said that, but the problem with it -- there are a

16

number of problems.

17

Maryland courts have invited other jurisdictions to

18

examine the constitutional validity of prior convictions

19

obtained in Maryland that other jurisdictions would like

20

to use for sentencing enhancement, and Maryland has

21

specifically said that they will not review those

22

convictions in that manner.

23

One is that actually in Maryland the

Often a defendant, by the time the prior

24

conviction is being used against him for sentencing

25

enhancement, he has no avenues for State relief at that

1

point, and so he would not be able to bring a State post

2

conviction, and with respect to the types of claims that

3

we're alleging here, he probably would have had no

4

opportunity to --

5

QUESTION:

Would you clarify this, because it

6

may be relevant:

whether under Maryland law any or all of

7

the claims your client now wishes to make could have been

8

litigated, either on direct review in Maryland, or on some

9

kind of postconviction review?
MS. FRENCH:

10

The ineffective assistance of

11

counsel claims are not generally reviewable on direct

12

appeal in Maryland, and that's because the record is not

13

normally developed enough for the court of appeals to

14

review that violation, and the same is true as to the

15

claim of an unknowing and involuntary plea.

16

However, Mr. Custis could have brought a post

17

conviction action with respect to the 1985 conviction.

18

could not have brought one with respect to the 1989

19

conviction because he was never in custody.
QUESTION:

20

Did you challenge both prior

21

convictions on the basis of ineffective assistance?

22

that --

23

MS. FRENCH:

24

QUESTION:

25

Is

Yes, Your Honor.
Now, could he have obtained Federal

habeas review of these claims?

He

MS. FRENCH:

Your Honor,

I think there are two

different kinds of Federal habeas review that you might be
referring to.
QUESTION:

Well, he was still on probation, so

for purposes of being in custody.
MS. FRENCH:

He could have pursued a 2254

petition, and he would have to be in custody to bring that
petition.

The problem is that if he had not exhausted

State remedies, then he would not be able to have that
claim reviewed, and so -QUESTION:

But if there were no State remedy,

then there's no exhaustion problem, right?
MS. FRENCH:

That's true, so that would have

been -QUESTION:

You can't have it both ways.

You're

here saying he had no State remedy.
MS. FRENCH:
QUESTION:

That's right.
So presumably Federal habeas could

have been used.
MS. FRENCH:
that's true.

As to the 1985 conviction, I think

As to the 1989 conviction, he was never in

custody for purposes of that conviction, so I don't think
he would have been eligible to pursue either type of
review.
QUESTION:

Why should we choose Burgett-Tucker

reasoning rather than Lewis reasoning to construe the

2y.

congressional silence?

3 •

MS. FRENCH:

Your Honor, Lewis did not deal with

4

a sentencing enhancement statute, and it specifically

5

reaffirmed Burgett andTucker.

6

Lewis dealt with a very unusual statute in which

7

the legislative history was clear that Congress had

8

intended to legislate very broadly and try to keep guns

9

out of the hands of dangerous people, and Congress not

10

only prohibited convicted felons from possessing guns, but

11

also anyone who had an indictment pending, and so there

12

were other considerations present in Lewisthat are not

13

present here.

14

QUESTION:

Couldn't we take the position that

15

just as it may be appropriate, or may have been

16

appropriate for Congress to identify kind of a high risk

17

class, as in Lewis, it would also be appropriate for

18

Congress to identify a very high risk class by reference

19

to three convictions and violent offenses?

20
21

MS. FRENCH:

Congress could have done that, but

I don't think they did that in this instance.

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. FRENCH:

Why not?
Well, once the defendant has been

24

convicted under section 922(g), then he's already been

25

classified, and he's been shown to be guilty of that

1

offense.

2

The mandatory --

3

QUESTION:

No, but Congress could simply say we

4

want a further classification, and in effect he's on

5

notice that if there are three convictions that satisfy

6

the other criteria for the convictions, he's facing this

7

significantly enhanced penalty.

8

deterrence.
MS. FRENCH:

9

It increases the

Your Honor, that's true, but the

10

statutory history, the legislative history shows that

11

Congress' purpose in enacting section 924(e) was actually

12

incapacitation.

13

and lock him up for a minimum of 15 years so that he won't

14

commit these underlying crimes such as burglary and

15

robbery, there was no indication that Congress intended to

16

classify defendants through that penalty provision, and

17

increase deterrence in the manner that you're suggesting.

18

In other words, to take this defendant

QUESTION:

Why don't we infer that Congress

19

meant you give the prior conviction the same faith and

20

credit it had in the jurisdiction where it was rendered if

21

you want to get it upset there, but unless and until you

22

do, then this is -- the conviction of the State of

23

Maryland is in effect the conviction for all of the United

24

States?

25

MS. FRENCH:

Your Honor, there are a few reasons
11

why that -- those principles aren't applicable here.
2

First of all, I would note just as a factual matter there

3

were no judgments of conviction introduced in this case,

4

and so obviously there were no duly authenticated

5

judgments of conviction, and that would be required to

6

invoke full faith and credit, but there are a number of

7

other, broader reasons why full faith and credit would not

8

apply here.
One I think is that the issues which here are

9
10

ineffective assistance and unknowing and involuntary plea

11

were not actually litigated in the prior proceeding, and

12

there would have been no possibility of litigating them

13

during those proceedings, because the violations actually

14

took place during those proceedings.

15

In addition, in Maryland there's no collateral

16

estoppel unless the claim being heard in the prior

17

adjudication was identical with the one presented in this

18

case.

19

QUESTION:

But if there's a constitutional

20

infirmity, it's got to be where it was rendered.

If a

21

judgment is good where it's rendered, it's got to be good

22

everyplace else in the United States.

23

constitutional flaw that infects these convictions, then

24

they can't stand where they're rendered.

25

say that you can have a conviction that's good in Maryland

If there's a

(800) FOR DEPO

It's strange to

but not elsewhere in the United States.
MS. FRENCH:

Well, Your Honor, I don't know if

you could say it's good in Maryland.

In this case, we're

simply asking the Federal district court to examine the
constitutional validity to decide whether it should impose
an enhanced sentence based on the conviction.
The only reason why the conviction is still good
in Maryland is because there's no opportunity to pursue
relief there, so that would be why the prior conviction,
even though it's not technically overturned in Maryland,
should not be used for sentencing enhancement in the
Federal case.
I would also just note that normally a guilty
plea is not a valid and final judgment under collateral
estoppel law, and in Maryland there's no nonmutual
collateral estoppel in criminal cases, so for all those
reasons, I don't think full faith and credit would be
applicable.
The principles of Burgett were applied directly
to Federal sentencing in United States v. Tucker, and the
same reasoning was applied in Tucker.

In addition, the

Court stated that it would be unconstitutional for the
sentencing court to rely on misinformation of a
constitutional magnitude.
QUESTION:

Well, is Burgett limited to the
13

1

situation where the conviction is void?

2

representation by counsel at all, for example, clear on

3

the face that it's void?

4

MS. FRENCH:

I don't think so.

I mean, no

I don't think

5

so, Your Honor.

Burgett does use the phrase,

6

"presumptively void," but I don't think that was intended

7

to limit claims to convictions that are invalid on their

8

face, but rather simply to refer to the fact that at least

9

in the context of getting in violations there's no further

10

inquiry required, and my understanding of the term, for

11

example from Parke v. Raley, it's a term that's used to

12

determine where the burden of proof is placed.

13

In other words, if a prior conviction is

14

obtained in violation of the right to counsel, then the

15

burden of proof is properly placed -- well, it's simply

16

assumed that that conviction is -- cannot be used for

17

enhancement, because it's just an intolerable risk that it

18

is too unreliable to be counted, but that in other

19

situations the burden of proof would be properly placed on

20

the defendant, and then the Government would have an

21

opportunity to respond, so I don't think there's anything

22

about Burgett that limits the challenges to convictions

23

that are void on their face.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, certainly in Federal habeas

law, if you look at Johnson v. Zerbst, which is one of the
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

earliest Federal habeas -- where the Court says that where

2

there was no appointment of counsel that was an actual

3

lack of jurisdiction in the Court, and I don't think we've

4

ever said that about other constitutional violations.

5

That suggests a distinction between failure to appoint

6

counsel at all and any number of other constitutional

7

violations.
MS. FRENCH:

8

9

That's true, but I don't think

that -- I think that when the term void was used in

10

Burgett v. Texas, I believe what it meant was voidable,

11

because the conviction itself would still be in existence,

12

and in fact in that case it was.

13

overturned in the jurisdiction where it was obtained, so

14

that it would be incumbent on the defendant to come

15

forward and have that actually reversed, and so I don't

16

think that that distinction was intended to limit or draw

17

the line on which claims could be considered.

It had not been

It's true that if it's a jurisdictional defect,

18
19

then it would be deemed void and not just voidable, but

20

the constitutional claims that are brought in Federal

21

sentencing proceedings have never been limited in that

22

fashion.

23

In fact, I would just note that Burgett referred

24

to other constitutional errors prior to stating the

25

holding, there was some discussion about other
15

1

constitutional errors that are applicable or

2

constitutional rights that have been applied to the States

3

that would be considered limitations on State court

4

sentencing.

5

The Government has argued that the structural

6

defect should be used in order to determine which claims

7

should be considered in Federal sentencing proceedings.

8

We believe there's a critical flaw in the use of that test

9

as a threshold test to determine which claims should be

10
11

heard.
The structural defect test doesn't identify all

12

errors that undermine the reliability of a conviction.

13

Instead, that test was designed to determine which errors

14

would require automatic reversal and not be subject to

15

harmless error analysis, and the fact that an error is not

16

a structural defect does not mean that it doesn't go to

17

the reliability of the conviction, and as an example, I

18

would just point to a case where a coerced confession was

19

introduced against a defendant and was the chief or sole

20

evidence against the defendant.

21

In that instance, that error is not considered

22

structural, and it would be subject to harmless error

23

analysis, but it would be deemed to be harmful, and

24

therefore the resulting conviction would be unreliable,

25

and that's an error that should be recognized in Federal
16

1

2

sentencing proceedings under the ACCA.
QUESTION:

The fact that a court were to

3

determine that the introduction of a coerced confession

4

was not harmless error would not necessarily be on the

5

basis of the fact that the coerced confession made the

6

conviction unreliable.

7

that this Court has adopted, there are lots of elements to

8

it that do not necessarily lead one to conclude, I think,

9

that the statement was unreliable, but just it's not

Under the definition of coercion

10

permissible for the Government to use this sort of method

11

to get a statement out of a person.

12

MS. FRENCH:

I think that could be true in some

13

cases, but certainly in a lot of cases it would also

14

indicate that the resulting conviction cannot be relied

15

upon as an indicator of guilt, and that's because

16

generally coerced confessions are not considered reliable

17

in and of themselves, so I would agree there may be some

18

instances where it would not go to reliability, but I

19

think in most instances it would, and the claim should not

20

be barred as a threshold matter from consideration in

21

Federal sentencing proceedings.

22

Whether or not the structural defect test

23

applies, we believe that the claims that Mr. Custis raised

24

in this case should be reviewed in a Federal sentencing

25

proceeding.

First of all, they do qualify as structural

1

defects, and second, they do undermine the reliability of

2

the resulting conviction.

3

QUESTION:

You're suggesting that a Boykin

4

violation or a denial of effective assistance of counsel

5

are structural defects?

6

MS. FRENCH:

Your Honor, I'm -- yes.

7

Ineffective assistance I believe would qualify as a

8

structural defect, because in order to establish a

9

violation, a defendant has to prove prejudice, and that

probability that the result of the proceeding would have

That's a very substantial extension

of what we've had to say about structural defects.
MS. FRENCH:

Well, Your Honor, we're not

19

advocating that that test should apply by itself.

20

believe that structural defects plus other errors that go

21

to reliability should be recognized by Federal district

22

courts in the sentencing proceedings, but I think that

23

there is a strong argument that ineffective assistance of

24

counsel would be a structural error once it is shown,

25

because to show that claim, the defendant has to have

We

shown that there was a breakdown in the adversarial
process and that the result of the proceeding is
unreliable, and that's not the type of error that can be
analyzed in light of the other evidence presented.
QUESTION:

Ms. French, that wasn't my

understanding of what we meant by structural.
I thought what we meant by it, and the reason we
said that that's the criterion of whether harmless error
analysis can apply, is whether it's the kind of an effort
that infects the entire proceeding so that you can't
separate out the harm that comes from it, and in effect,
not having counsel at all, you indeed cannot possibly tell
what harm came from it, but if there is ineffective
assistance of counsel, you point out the instances in
which he was ineffective.

He didn't get this witness, he

didn't get the other witness, he didn't interview
somebody.
You can tell what harm came from those things
and whether in fact the result was harmless, so I don't
see -- you're using structural as sort of synonymous with
causes the result to be unreliable.

I don't think that's

how we used it in our past decisions.
MS. FRENCH:

No, Your Honor, that's not what I

and I think it- just depends on whether you look at

ineffective assistance in terms of the requirement of

3

proving both prongs, which would be the attorney

4

incompetence, and the prejudice, or whether you just look

5

at the first prong, and then consider this second prong a

6

harmless error type test.

7

QUESTION:

Well, it -- attorney in -- it isn't

8

enough to show you had an incompetent attorney.

I mean,

you can't bring in witnesses who say yes, I practiced with

10

this man for 30 years and he is really incompetent.

11

have to show that his behavior at trial was incompetent,

12

isn't that right, and you have to show, this is what he

13

did that he shouldn't have done, or this is what he didn't

14

do that he should have done, and it is possible to

15

identify the consequences that flow from those particular

16

instances of incompetence, hence, ineffective assistance

17

of counsel is not a structural defect.

18

MS. FRENCH:

You

Well, that's true, but I think that

19

in addition to showing that the attorney's performance

20

fell below those minimal standards, the defendant also has

21

to show prejudice resulting from that, and if the

22

defendant is able to take out that claim, a meritorious

23

ineffective assistance claim, then he has shown that the

24

result of the proceeding is unreliable.

25

Another way of putting it is that it's

1

impossible to analyze the effect of that error in light of

2

other evidence presented, particularly when we're talking

3

about a guilty plea, because in the context of a guilty

4

plea, the defendant has to show that he would not have

5

pleaded guilty but would have insisted on a trial, and so

6

it's an error that would affect the framework of the

7

proceeding under the structural defect test.
QUESTION:

8

Are you using prejudice as synonymous

9

with harm?

I think the two requirements may be quite

10

different.

That is to say, the mere fact that you didn't

11

get this witness introduced would have prejudiced you.

12

However, it still might have been harmless.

13

acknowledge you can have prejudice that is harmless?

I don't believe so.

There's no

That would be our position.

QUESTION:

Do you think it's not a proper

2

interpretation of the statute to say that things that are

obvious on the face of it, like no counsel, you can use to

attack a prior conviction, but where you would sidetrack

the sentencing forum into an entire hearing and

not what Congress wanted?

Your Honor, I don't think there's

any suggestion that Congress intended to limit claims

based on the factual inquiry required.

approach that the court of appeals took.

think that that would be consistent with Burgett and

Tucker, and I think it would violate the Constitution to

decide which claims can be heard based --

But I thought those were cases where

16

the absence of counsel was something -- you had counsel or

17

you didn't have counsel, whether counsel is effective or

the knowledge the defendant had may require an

19

investigation, at least a transcript, perhaps calling

20

witnesses, quite different from did you have counsel or

21

didn't you have counsel.

22

MS. FRENCH:

I think sometimes it would require

23

more of an inquiry, but other times it might be a similar

24

inquiry, because in the case of a Gideon violation there's

25

always the question of whether there was a valid waiver,

defendant and the proceeding, and so I don't think they

can always be distinguished on that basis.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. BRYSON

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10
11

MR. BRYSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

12

If I could first address the question raised by

13

Justice O'Connor, I believe, as to whether there were any

14

remedies at any point or would be now with respect to the

15

two prior convictions in the Maryland courts or in the

16

Federal habeas courts, I think the answer is yes.

17

The first conviction was a 1985 conviction for

18

which the defendant was given 8 years -- I believe 5 years

19

in custody and a 3-year probationary term to follow.

20

8 years was still running at the time he was arrested and

21

charged in this case, and in fact if I -- although this

22

was not a matter that was made a part of the discussion in

23

the lower courts, nonetheless the presentence report

24

indicates that he was charged a with violation of

25

probation based on what happened in this case.

That

1

His probation was violated in the 1985 case, so

2;i:;

he would, given Maryland habeas law, which is effectively

3

equivalent to Federal habeas law, he would have been able,

4

even at that point, to go into the Maryland courts and

5

challenge his 1985 conviction.

6

The -- of course he would have been able to

7

challenge that conviction at the time, either on direct

8

appeal or immediately thereafter on habeas if he wanted to

9

raise the ineffective assistance of counsel claim which

10

was raised with respect to the 1985 conviction.

11

With respect to the other conviction, the 1989

12

conviction, we do not understand the claim ever to have

13

been a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

14

wasn't the claim that was raised in the district court in

15

this case.

That

The claim that was raised in the district court

17

in this case was essentially a Boykin claim, although

18

based principally on State law, but in any event, that --

19

although the sentence that was given in that case was a

20

noncustodial sentence, nonetheless, that conviction could

21

have been appealed immediately in the Maryland courts.

22

Neither of these two convictions was appealed.

23

Both of them were -- well, one of them was a guilty plea

24

conviction, the other was a conviction obtained on what's

25

called the stipulated facts, a plea of not guilty with

stipulated facts.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Bryson, isn't it probable that

3

most of these cases are going to be challenges to guilty

4

pleas?

5

MR. BRYSON:

6

QUESTION:

Yes.
Because there are so many of them, so

7

the real question is, can you expect the defendant to

8

immediately appeal from a guilty plea?

9

MR. BRYSON:

Well, Your Honor, a lot of

10

defendants do appeal from guilty pleas, particularly if

11

they don't like the sentence, but the real question is, if

12

something has gone terribly wrong, at least you can expect

13

the defendant either to appeal immediately or to come back

14

with a State habeas or Federal habeas action challenging

15

the guilty plea at some point if he's dissatisfied with

16

the disposition.

17

The irony here is that the reason guilty pleas

18

are typically not challenged is because of the reason that

19

they're tendered, is because the defendant really doesn't

20

have any quarrel, or at least understands that he doesn't

21

have any legal quarrel with the State's case.

22

principle that this Court has recognized again and again

23

is that if you are pleading guilty, if you're talking

24

about the guilty plea case, in the vast majority of cases

25

you're talking about somebody as to whom there is no

The basic

serious question of guilt.

hi

QUESTION:

That's right.

In a vast majority of

3 •

those cases, there won't be any basis for a challenge,

4

either, because the record normally shows that the normal

5

procedures were followed, but the problem I suppose we

6

have is in the case, the rare case where a defendant does

7

come in with a transcript that shows a very plain

8

violation of his constitutional rights, and your

9

suggestion is that should simply be ignored.
MR. BRYSON:

10

Yes, Your Honor.

The bottom line

11

of our position is that even if the transcript shows

12

something that would be -- give him a reversal in a minute

13

had he taken a direct appeal, that that can't be the

14

subject of a collateral attack at the sentencing

15

enhancement proceeding.

denial of counsel.

4

We're

We know that that is the kind of violation

5

that's cognizable in a challenge to a sentence at

6

sentencing, to a conviction that's used for enhancement,

7

so our question is, well, what else has the same qualities

8

as denial of counsel, and we think the best description of

9

that is something that when you look at the system, the

10

scheme of criminal -- the criminal scheme that resulted in

11

a conviction you say, that scheme cannot reliably produce

12

a conviction in which we have confidence, and I would give

13

you an example.

14

For instance, the Turney case.

You have a system in which the judges

15

essentially are being paid piecework for convictions.

16

look at that system and you say, that can't really produce

17

something that we are prepared to call conviction in the

modern sense of the word.

the reliability of the ultimate judgment, but the problem

with choosing the structural test, because in order to

going to have to search the record.

violations are only evident from the record, aren't they?

respect we adopt the Fourth Circuit's view.

structural errors that go to the integrity of the

structure of the criminal procedure that's being used.

QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, what you propose,

structural in the sense of obvious structural -- I wish

we'd get another word so we don't confuse it with our

6

harmless error jurisdiction, but whatever you want to call

7

it -- obvious-structural, hyphenated.

8

to me, would make a lot of sense as a statutory test, as

9

an interpretation of the statute, but I find it difficult

10

to see why that should be a constitutional test, which is

11

what you're posing it as --

12

MR. BRYSON:

13

QUESTION:

That test, it seems

Your Honor, what we --- and it seems to me the

14

constitutional test is whether the trial was fundamentally

15

vitiated, so I can understand jurisdiction.

16

jurisdiction, as a constitutional test, but once you go

17

beyond that, why should obvious-structural defect be more

18

unconstitutional than less obvious-structural defects, so

19

long as it's a structural defect?
MR. BRYSON:

20

No

Well, for these purposes, Your

21

Honor, one very important consideration to bear in mind.

22

problem.

When you're looking at a due process issue like

1

2ii

that, one consideration you have to take into account is,

3

how much of a burden does it place on the system to have

4

to engage in that kind of review, and when you're talking

5

about something that is an obvious, on its face, just

6

essentially voiding structural defect, then that doesn't

7

put much of a burden on the system.

.

8

On the other hand, if you're talking about

9

something to take the example here, like ineffective

10

assistance of counsel, which it's true may in the

11

appropriate cases be prejudicial, you are talking about

12

something that is the most fact-intensive, the most

burdensome kind of inquiry.

Well, but Mr. Bryson, not only may be

prejudicial, must be prejudicial --

really is a contradiction in terms to talk about a

Sure.
Because what went on here is, the

defendant was asked by the judge, has your lawyer told

you -- and I can't remember the exact words, but something

11

like, about the defense you have in this case, which

12

sounds like the judge is asking, have you been informed

13

that you have a way out here, and not surprisingly the

14

defendant said no, and then the judge pursues that a

15

little bit --

again, and comes back and says he's satisfied, so I think

I'm sure I didn't get the right kind of Boykin warnings,

2

because I remember clearly that the whole thing was over

in 2 minutes, and the judge is not going to remember, and

the defense lawyer in all likelihood is not going to

case that comes from a State that's six States over, and

in which the burden of getting all the evidence, even if

In this particular case, in the

it is our reading of the timing that a conviction -- a

2

challenge could still have been brought in a State and

3

then ultimately the Federal courts based on the continuing

4

custody under the 1985 conviction.

5

The 1989 conviction, it is true would not have

6

been open as we read the Maryland law to a collateral

7

attack, and of course it was final, so there couldn't have

8

been any direct attack.

9

On the other hand, Maryland does have quorum

QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, supposing the district

court in this case took all these convictions into

consideration, as the court of appeals said it could, and

the defendant is then sent to prison for a number of

years.

Under our Malang decision, could he then in

Your Honor, our reading of Malang

11

is that he could not, that those convictions he would not

language at the end of Malang that leaves open the

14

question of just how you can challenge conviction A when

15

you have been -- when that has been used to enhance your

sentence for conviction B.

17

If I may say one more word about the practical

18

impacts and the burden of this, I think it is an

19

increasing practice that we see increasing numbers of

20

cases come in, and just recently I saw a case in which a

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARY FRENCH

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14

MS. FRENCH:

I'd just like to briefly point out

15

that the court of appeals decisions are cited on pages 13

16

and 14 of our brief, and there are eight circuits that

17

have uniformly allowed challenges under the ACCA.

18

that a number of the cases that Mr. Bryson was referring

19

to arose under the Sentencing Guidelines, and there are

20

different considerations under the Sentencing Guidelines,

21

including the fact that there are departure provisions

22

available, and there is also guidelines language that

23

governed whether challenges were allowed, at least up

24

until recently.

QUESTION:

What about the infirmity of the

would have no impact on these proceedings.
