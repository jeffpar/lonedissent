ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. BISBEE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BISBEE:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
QUESTION:

10

Wait just a minute, Mr. Bisbee.

11

Spectators should not talk while they remain in the

12

courtroom.

13
14

The Court remains in session.
MR. BISBEE:

Thank you, Your Honor.

If it

please the Court:

15

This case arises under the Civil Rights Act of

16

1871, which affords a cause of action to individuals who

17

are deprived of rights secured by the Constitution of the

18

United States by officials acting under color of State

19

law.

20

This Court has frequently admonished and

21

instructed that those of us litigating these cases advise

22

of the specific nature of the right protected.

23

protected asserted by Mr. Albright in this case is the

24

right to liberty secured by substantive due process.

25

The right

This Court has further admonished and instructed

counsel that when a right protected -- or liberty right

2

protected by substantive due process is asserted, that the

3

party declare -- delineate with some degree of

4

particularity the exact nature of the right.

5

exact nature of the right that Mr. Albright asserts in

6

this court today, Your Honors, is the right to be free of

7

a criminal prosecution except upon probable cause to

8

believe that a crime has been committed and that the

9

individual sought to be made the party defendant committed

10

And the

the crime.
The United States Court of Appeals for the

11
12

Seventh Circuit in Chicago held that we - - that Mr.

13

Albright did not state a cause of action.

14

however, did state that the actions of the defendant, the

15

respondent in this case, Mr. Roger Oliver, a police

16

detective with the city of Macomb, Illinois Police

17

Department, a city of about 25,000 people -- his actions

18

were shocking and that they, in all likelihood, had

19

exceeded the boundaries of reasonableness which that court

20

had - -

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. BISBEE:

23

QUESTION:

The court,

Well, Mr. Bisbee.
Yes, Your Honor.
Why is it that the mere filing of a

24

criminal charge without more should constitute a

25

deprivation of liberty?

The State is just saying we have

1

cause to believe that you, John Jones, committed a crime.

2

Now, why is that a deprivation of liberty at that stage?
MR. BISBEE:

3

Your Honor, I believe if that

4

charge is without probable cause - - it is without

5

deprivation of liberty, but the Court need not reach that

6

question particularly under the circumstances --

7

QUESTION:

Well, why should it be, in light of

8

holdings that, for instance, a defamatory statement by a

9

government official would not constitute a deprivation of

10
11

liberty?
MR. BISBEE:

A defamatory statement by a

12

government official does not deprive liberty because it

13

does not deprive any right protected by the Constitution

14

of the United States, Your Honor.

15

That is why.

The charge -- the invocation of criminal

16

process; the bringing to bear of the most severe power

17

possessed by government against an individual; the

18

requirement that the individual at that point do whatever

19

is necessary, whether it be the posting of bond with the

20

State, whether it be the securing of counsel, whether it

21

be the procuring of investigative services, whether it be

22

whatever else is necessary in order to defend not just his

23

reputation but his very liberty, his very ability to lead

24

his life as he has chosen to lead his life; that is what

25

is at stake at that point.

1

QUESTION:

So your contention is that even

2

though he is never arrested on the criminal charge, that

3

the mere filing of it deprives him of liberty.

4

MR. BISBEE:

If the mere filing of it is without

5

probable cause, Your Honor, that is my contention.

6

the Court need not reach that issue.

7

QUESTION:

But

Mr. Bisbee, he was arrested, and

8

police officers don't prosecute, they arrest.

And what

9

troubles me about the case you're bringing is you start

10

out with a potential Fourth Amendment claim, an analogy to

11

the common law false arrest.

12

officer does and that's what he's responsible for.

13

That's what the police

And then you're shifting over to substantive due

14

process because you missed out on what you conceive to be

15

the statute of limitations.

16

the police officer's conduct.

17

seize unreasonably without probable cause.

18

the rubric under which this case should be treated?

19

should we suddenly get into a new territory simply because

20

the action was started arguably too late?

21

MR. BISBEE:

The Fourth Amendment governs
It says thou shalt not
Why isn't that
Why

Justice Ginsburg, it is altogether

22

correct, as you state, that the police officer's original

23

and customary duty is to make the arrest.

24

absolutely correct that the criteria in the Fourth

25

Amendment governing reasonable searches and seizures

You're also

govern his actions.

2

But with all respect, Justice Ginsburg, your

3

statement is incomplete in that in most jurisdictions,

4

including Illinois, a police officer plays a substantial

5

role in the institution of the criminal charge itself.

6

And it did in this case.

7

And most often, Your Honor, the police officer

8

is the one, because of the burdens placed upon the

9

prosecutor's office.

As the Court enunciated so clearly

10

in Imbler v. Pachtman, 10, 15 years, it is the police

11

officer who is the one who is privy to and has knowledge

12

of the investigative sources, the people who are able to

13

give him information as to when crimes are --

14

QUESTION:

What is the police officer doing

15

other than backing up his arrest?

16

then the person technically is in arrest status until the

17

criminal case is over.

18

technically arrested for the duration of that procedure.

19

So why does the police officer's participation

He made an arrest and

He's released on bond, but he is

20

shift from the arrest -- initial arrest, and then whatever

21

statements he makes thereafter is consistent with

22

maintaining the arrest, rather than shifting the police

23

officer from the role of police officer to the role of

24

prosecutor?

25

I must respectfully disagree with

Couldn't that be regarded simply as

consistent with and perpetuating the arrest status of the

defendant?
MR. BISBEE:

10

Well, it certainly is part of that.

11

But, Your Honor, as this Court held in Malley v. Briggs,

the -- individuals are held responsible for the natural

13

consequences of their actions.

14

officer who participates, particularly as materially as

15

Detective Oliver did, in the attestation to the criminal

MR. BISBEE:

What was the first one?
Brinegar v. the United States,

the Fourth Amendment.

6

MR. BISBEE:

Well, that didn't -- that dealt with

It certainly did.

But the

7

language -- the dictum, Your Honor, and I think dictum

8

whereby this Court has assumed that probable cause for a

9

prosecution is necessary -QUESTION:

10

Well, Brinegar was a case in a

11

Federal court and the dicta certainly didn't say that not

12

being -- freedom from prosecution without probable cause

13

is a substantive liberty interest, did it?

14

MR. BISBEE:

Your Honor, it came awfully close.

15

Because Brinegar did say that the probable cause standard

16

was designed to prevent unfounded charges of crime and to

17

protect the individual from unfounded charges of crime,

18

notwithstanding the fact that it arose in a Fourth

19

Amendment search context under the Volstead Act, or

20

something.

21

QUESTION:

Well, do you think we should then go

22

through all our cases that explain the reason for the

23

adoption of, say, the Fourth Amendment or the Fifth

24

Amendment, and say that all of those reasons become

25

substantive liberty interests?

1

MR. BISBEE:

Well, I think -- in your case -- in

2

this situation, Your Honor, the answer is yes.

Because

3

you can go back.

4

going back to Hurtado v. California in 1884 where the

5

Court in very clear terms - - when it said that a grand

6

jury was not necessary,, the grand jury indictment was not

7

necessary to due process, nonetheless said that the core

8

value, the core value which the grand jury was designed to

9

protect, namely the right to be free from prosecution

In a linear - - in a linear chronology,

10

except upon probable cause, was very much a part of the

11

individual liberty.

12

And you take that type of - - you take the

13

language and the holding in Hurtado v. California, you

14

take it into Brinegar v. the United States, and you tie it

15

in, then, with cases like Ingraham v. Wright, which is the

16

student paddling case, and you take footnotes 41 and 42

17

and you have the Court coalescing, coalescing the liberty

18

to be free from unwanted infliction of State --

19

QUESTION:

You're taking three cases, all of

20

which were decided against the claimant of constitutional

21

rights, and saying that dicta in them have created a new

22

constitutional right.

23

MR. BISBEE:

Your Honor, I'm saying that the

24

dicta in those cases created the assumption that has been

25

implicit in this Court's decisions from --as long -- as

But that, Your

Honor, quite honestly, is ancillary to the essential

I can understand your argument if the

the charge started at a certain point.

thought I heard you to say, the seizure, the arrest does

indeed continue, that the person remains in a state of

arrest until the criminal charge is dropped, then I don't

7

understand why we go from the Fourth Amendment to the

8

Fifth Amendment.
MR. BISBEE:

9

But if, what I

Well, in the -- the easy answer to

10

that in this case, as you pointed out, was that the

11

statute of limitations was not abided by by the plaintiff

12

in this case, and therefore he had no Fourth Amendment

13

claim.

14

a Fourth Amendment claim accrued at the time of the

15

arrest.

16

He could not do it because the cause of action for

So we -QUESTION:

But why do you -- you take that to be

gospel.

Is it necessary -- necessarily so?

18

conceives of the arrest as continuing until the criminal

charges are dismissed, then maybe the statute of

20

limitations should have started ticking later rather than

21

earlier.

1

law to be simply that the cause of action for an arrest,

2

whether at common law or under section 1983, accrued at

3

the time of the arrest.

4

the point is that Graham v. Connor was explicit that at

5

some point -- now, whether we're talking about something

6

metaphysical here or not, I don't know.

7

after the arrest has taken place, the due process clause

does take over.

But at some point

All right, assuming it does and

10

assuming that we were to accept your position by

11

approaching the case not on the assumption that Justice

12

Ginsburg has questioned on, but on the assumption that

somehow there is an independent set of interests at stake,

your answer to Justice O'Connor's question in which you

were telling, sort of, what the -- what the consequences

were, were all property consequences.

If you don't accept Justice Ginsburg's

Well then under the Takings Clause

we've got a liberty interest because the property owner

Well, certainly there is, Your

And we have here -- under the liberty rubric we have

But there is -- that is a separate prohibition.

QUESTION:

You can't go after the prosecutor.

Isn't that so?

9

MR. BISBEE:
QUESTION:

10

That's so.
Isn't it odd that you're going after

11

the police officer whose main job is to arrest for a

prosecution because you can't go against the prosecutor?

13

Something doesn't quite fit.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES G. SOTOS

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

3

5

MR. SOTOS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Your Honors, we have three principal

6

submissions.

First, that the Court should not expand the

7

concepts of fundamental liberties and substantive due

8

process in order to reach a claim that an individual was

9

charged with a crime without probable cause so long, of

10

course, as that individual was not incarcerated pending

11

disposition of the charges.

12

Secondly, to the extent that there might be some

13

intrusion on a liberty interest, the focus for purposes of

14

due process should be on whether the State provides

15

adequate procedures in order to protect against the risk

16

of an arbitrary deprivation of that interest.

17

case I would point out that the petitioner concedes he

18

advances no challenge to Illinois' procedures for

19

processing and filing of criminal charges.

20

And in this

Finally, in the event that the Court determines

21

that there would be a fundamental right which could

22

potentially be implicated under the circumstances of this

23

case, we would submit that principles of substantive due

24

process should not be implicated unless a petitioner or a

plaintiff alleges facts which are sufficient to support an

of intentional or egregious misconduct.

you've mentioned?

7

MR. SOTOS:

We think it would have some bearing

inherent in the criminal process, as well as the post

position that the State remedies were rendered inadequate

2

solely because a State chose to do away with its common

3

law tort remedy.
QUESTION:

4

So you're relying on the State

5

criminal procedure apparatus to vindicate the defendant's

6

rights, correct?

7

MR. SOTOS:

In this case we're not, Your Honor,

8

because the State of Illinois does provide the common law

9

tort remedy.

But if we were here on another case in which

10

a State did not provide that remedy, we do think there

11

would be a strong argument that the State's criminal

12

procedures, in and of themselves, could satisfy due

13

process.

14

As Justice Stevens indicated in his concurrence

15

opinion in Daniels v. Williams, the State does not have to

16

provide a post deprivation common law tort remedy in all

17

circumstances to satisfy --

18

QUESTION:

Well, so, Mr. Sotos, you take the

19

view, then, that if the officer makes an arbitrary arrest

20

without probable cause there is no Fourth Amendment

21

violation simply because the State has its criminal

22

procedures to take care of these things?

position.

I don't think so.

And I would point

11

out that the petitioner pressed the fundamental right to

MR. SOTOS:

Because in this particular case --

QUESTION:

Well, but if it results in an order

saying you can't leave and all of this was obtained on the

basis of an unlawful arrest, is there -- is there some

deprivation of the right to travel there?

MR. SOTOS:

I would say not in this case,

1

because there is no allegation here that the petitioner

2

even sought to leave the State.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. SOTOS:

Well suppose that is the allegation?
Under those circumstances, if there

5

had been an allegation that the petitioner sought to leave

6

the State, I would submit that the restriction that the

7

State of Illinois imposes on the fundamental right to

8

travel is a very narrowly tailored restriction which is

9

necessary to serve the State's compelling interest of

10

insuring that criminal defendants appear for trial.
QUESTION:

11

So it's okay to enter such an order

12

even though it is based on an arrest made without probable

13

cause.

14

That makes it okay.
MR. SOTOS:

No. My point would be that under

15

those circumstances the State's restriction would be

16

justified under a -- under a due process analysis, because

17

it was narrowly tailored to serve the State's interest.

18

All the individual has to do is go into court and ask for

19

leave to leave the State.

20

Now presumably if, in a given circumstance,

21

there were some special circumstances that rendered it

22

unlikely that the person would return for trial, then the

23

State's restriction would be justified under those -- for

24

those purposes.

conditions of the bond, which -- and in saying that, we

I would concede that certainly the

MR. SOTOS:

We would contend that under the

Illinois law there are a host of procedures inherent in

MR. SOTOS:

Early in the proceedings in the

And it was

after that that he dropped the common law malicious

QUESTION:

Without prejudice?

4

MR. SOTOS:

5

One other flaw in the petitioner's probable

Without prejudice, that's correct.

6

cause standard that he proposed upon this Court, we

7

believe, is that it would permit liability for mere

8

negligence of a public official.

9

the petitioner is seeking to create is a Federal remedy

And in so doing, what

10

which is not only supplementary to the remedy which is

11

provided now at the common law, but in fact is a much

12

broader remedy because what it does is read out the

13

element of malice which exists at the common law.

14

As a result of that, under the petitioner's

15

probable cause standard it is conceivable that virtually

16

every criminal defendant, after acquitted, could turn

17

around and sue in Federal court claiming that the evidence

18

was insufficient to support the charges against me.

19

We would submit that that standard far exceeds

20

the restrictions which this Court has placed on the scope

21

of due process violations in cases like Daniels v.

MR. SOTOS:

Okay.
What the petitioner really is

8

alleging is this claim is that he was prosecuted on the

9

basis of information which was provided to him by an

10

obviously unreliable paid informant.

11

really what he is contending is that he has the right to

12

be charged only upon reliable evidence.

And in so doing,

But, again, we know from cases in the grand jury

17

evidence to a grand jury.

18

In that case the Court refused to

Now, in this case we're not even talking about

19

exculpatory evidence.

Rather, it involves bits and pieces

20

of information which the petitioner claims cast grave

21

doubt on the informant's reliability:

22

was herself a cocaine addict; the fact that the substance

23

which she turned over to the officer turned out to be

24

baking soda; and finally the fact that she had previously

And also the fact that she had about

50 other cases that didn't work out, wasn't that right?
MR. SOTOS:

5

Well, again, there are a number of

6

allegations which cast doubt on the informant's

7

reliability.

8

the State has never been required to justify its charges

9

upon only reliable evidence.

10

But my point is that in the charging process

That has been a function for

the trial process, rather than the charging process.
