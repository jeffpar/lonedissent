Mr. Roberts.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case arises out of an explosion that killed

12

four employees on a drilling barge on the inland waters of

13

Louisiana.

14

by the Coast Guard, which therefore has almost no

15

regulations that address occupational safety and health on

16

the barge.

17

Guard has, nonetheless, exercised authority over the

18

working conditions on the barge so as to displace

19

application of the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

20

The barge is not inspected for certification

The question presented is whether the Coast

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Roberts, the Coast Guard

21

does have regulations, though, that require an emergency

22

plan and fire control devices.

23

MR. ROBERTS:

Not -- not that apply to this

24

vessel, Your Honor.

The -- the only occupational -- the

25

only regulations addressed to occupational safety and

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

health issues on this barge that have been identified by

2

respondent and its amici are regulations that address risk

3

from the marine sanitation devices, or the toilets, on the

4

vessel.

5

The only other regulation of which I'm aware

6

that deals with occupational safety and health is a

7

regulation that -- that addresses operating the vessel

8

while intoxicated.

9

regulations that address emergency procedures on inspected

10
11
12
13

Those regulations -- there are

vessels, but not on this type of uninspected vessel.
QUESTION:

Fire safety regulations are -- are

different from -- from -­
MR. ROBERTS:

No, no.

There are no fire and

14

safety regulations on -- on this vessel, Your Honor.

15

There are some specific fire and safety regulations

16

required by some statutes on particular types of vessels,

17

particularly vessels propelled by machinery.

18

the ones covered by -- by 46 U.S.C. 4102.

19

QUESTION:

Those are

Well, if -- if the Coast Guard has

20

regulations that try to contain a hazardous event, after

21

it occurs, as opposed to regulations trying to prevent it

22

in the first place, do you say that the containment

23

approach just doesn't qualify under this statute as a

24

Coast Guard regulation?

25

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor, but -- but with

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

respect to -- to this vessel, as I -- as I was saying,

2

they don't have such regulations.

3

approach would -- would qualify, although if -- if a

4

regulation was addressed to preventing a fire for

5

occurring, that would address a -- a different -- a

6

different hazard than a regulation that was addressed to

7

responding to that after the fire had occurred and -- and

8

could be put out.

9

The -- the containment

But -- but here, the Coast Guard has not

10

exercised statutory authority over the working conditions

11

involved in this case, and under section 4(b)(1) of the

12

act, the --

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts, do you think you could

14

explain to us -- just go back to the basics.

15

difference between an inspected vessel and an uninspected

16

And also, you introduced just now not this type

17

of an inspection.

18

inspection.

19

categories -­

What is the

So, there are subcategories within an

If you could just tell us what fills those

20

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

21

First, to -- to start at the -- the beginning of

22

your question, there are certain categories of vessels

23

that are listed under the statute as inspected vessels and

24

with respect -- under Coast Guard statutes as inspected

25

vessels.

On those vessels, the Coast Guard inspects them

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

at the beginning and then periodically for certification

2

that they're in satisfactory condition, fit for the

3

service for which they're intended and seaworthy.

4

Coast Guard also has comprehensive regulatory authority

5

over those vessels, and it's exercised that authority

6

comprehensively over those vessels.

7

vessels, the Secretary and the Coast Guard agree the -­

8

the Occupational Safety and Health Act doesn't apply.

9

The

So, for those

Then there's another set of vessels -­

10

QUESTION:

May I -- may I interrupt you right

11

there?

12

Does -- OSHA doesn't apply just as to those measures -­

13

just as to those working conditions on those vessels that

14

have been covered?

15

And I don't want to interrupt this whole answer.

Suppose OSHA has a regulation about kitchens.

16

You have to have guards on the carving knives or

17

something.

18

does not have that provision.

19

works, can OSHA regulate the -- the kitchen knife problem,

20

or -- or is it completely displaced?

21

And the Coast Guard, on an inspected vessel,

MR. ROBERTS:

Under the scheme, as it

Because -­

It's completely displaced on the

22

inspected vessels because the Coast Guard has

23

comprehensive authority over those and has exercised its

24

comprehensive authority on the inspected vessels by

25

promulgating comprehensive regulations, and those

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

regulations include specific ones addressing specific

2

hazards, as well as general provisions such as the one

3

that I was referring to that requires that the vessels be

4

fit for the service that they're intended and safe and

5

seaworthy.

6

working conditions are covered either by the specifics or

7

by the general, and the OSH Act does not apply.

And therefore, with respect to those, all the

8

But what we're concerned with in this case is a

9

-- is a vessel on which -- over which the Coast Guard has

10

much more limited authority and with respect to which it

11

-- it has authority to and has regulated only very

12

specific conditions.

13

QUESTION:

Getting back to the inspected

14

vessels, because this might have a bearing on -- on how we

15

write the opinion in this case, even though it's

16

uninspected.

17

there is concurrent jurisdiction between the Coast Guard

18

and OSHA on inspected vessels?

19

Are there instances in which there are -­

MR. ROBERTS:

Not with respect to regulation in

20

terms of setting occupational safety and health standards

21

and enforcing occupational safety and health standards.

22

There is, with respect to reporting or investigation on

23

inspected vessels -- I mean, not -- no.

24

answer is no.

25

QUESTION:

I guess the

I hope I didn't take you too far off

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the track.

2

uninspected vessels.

3

You were talking about inspected and

MR. ROBERTS:

To get back to the uninspected

4

vessels that -- that Justice Ginsburg had asked about and

5

which is what we -- we have in this case, on those

6

vessels, there's very limited authority.

7

specific statutory grants that deal with specific items of

8

safety.

9

working conditions on those vessels is spotty, depending

10
11

It flows from

And therefore, the Coast Guard regulation of

on the statutory grants of authority.
And as I said before, on -- this particular type

12

of inspected vessel is a -- is an inland drilling barge,

13

and on this barge there -- the statutory authority doesn't

14

give the Coast Guard authority to require fire

15

extinguishers or -- or those kind of things, and it gives

16

the Coast Guard no authority over the hazards from oil and

17

gas drilling, which are the hazards involved in this -- in

18

this case.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

But some -- some uninspected are more

closely watched?
MR. ROBERTS:

Some uninspected are more closely

22

watched, and we -- we would submit that no uninspected

23

vessel is comprehensively watched as to occupational

24

safety and health.

25

But that -- the Court doesn't need to -- to get

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

into that to -- to resolve this case.

2

asking here is that the Court reject the holding of the

3

Fifth Circuit, which is that there's an industry-wide

4

exemption for all seamen on all vessels from the

5

Occupational Safety and Health Act, even in situations

6

where the Coast Guard has not regulated the particular

7

working conditions on that vessel and the particular

8

working conditions that result in the occupational and

9

safety and health citation in the -- in that case.

10

QUESTION:

All -- all we're

How could one know that this is a

11

little-inspected vessel, as -- as distinguished from

12

uninspected but more inspected?

13

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, there are different types of

14

-- of uninspected vessels, and the -- depending on the

15

type, different sets of regulations apply to them.

16

the vessel operators are well aware of what regulations

17

apply to them.

18

And

But -- but on all uninspected vessels, it

19

doesn't really matter whether it's little or more, because

20

the way the statutory scheme works is that the Coast Guard

21

regulations that govern them apply to them.

22

standards apply to the extent that the working conditions

23

are not covered by Coast Guard regulations.

24

comes from the -- the language of section 4(b)(1) of the

25

OSH Act, which makes clear that displacement of the act is

And the OSHA

And that

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

limited to those working conditions with respect to which

2

other agencies exercise authority to prescribe or enforce

3

occupational safety and health standards.

4

QUESTION:

That -­

Now, Mr. Roberts, it seemed to me

5

here the administrative law judge seemed to say that the

6

OSHA regulations were not preempted because the Coast

7

Guard didn't require precisely the same thing that OSHA

8

did.

9

proposition, that if the Coast Guard adopted some general

And I would have thought it was a much more general

10

regulations in this area, that's enough, and that you

11

wouldn't look to see how closely OSHA's regs matched in

12

every detail the Coast Guard regs.

13

Government's view?

14

MR. ROBERTS:

What is the

The Government's view is that you

15

don't look to see if there's precisely the same regulation

16

in precisely the same manner of the same -- the same

17

degree of stringency.

18

whether there is a regulation on the part of the Coast

19

Guard that addresses the same working conditions, the same

20

hazards that are involved.

21

matter whether that's more stringent, less stringent, or

22

goes about it in a different way, it's displaced.

23

here there's no regulation that addresses this hazard -­

24
25

QUESTION:

You look to see whether the -­

And if there are, then no

But

Apparently both the Coast Guard and

OSHA agree here.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, they agree.

And the

2

agencies, not only the Coast Guard and OSHA, but other

3

agencies where this comes up, are -- have been in

4

agreement.

5

arisen because the agencies have been disputing about what

6

-- when it applies and when it doesn't and what working

7

conditions are covered by their different regulations.

8

They've arisen when employers have asserted that the OSH

9

Act doesn't apply so that nobody -- there would be no

10

These kinds of disputes about coverage haven't

regulations covering -­

11

QUESTION:

How much of a dispute would survive

12

the Solicitor General's review of the two agencies'

13

decision?

14

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, we didn't -- we didn't need

15

to resolve any dispute because there's been a longstanding

16

understanding between the two agencies, based on the

17

language of the OSH Act, as to how the -- how the two -­

18

the authority of each agency interacts with the other.

19

QUESTION:

If I can go back to inspected vessels

20

just for 1 minute.

I thought the answer you would give me

21

to the question about, you know, the kitchen knives would

22

be just what you told Justice O'Connor now with reference

23

to the uninspected vessels, that we look to see if the

24

working condition is regulated.

25

misunderstood your answer.

Or maybe I just

Was your answer to the effect

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that on inspected vessels, generally, all working

2

conditions are regulated, or at least they've been looked

3

at and there's been a decision not to regulate and that's

4

sufficient to displace OSHA?

5
6

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

It's the

same -­

7

QUESTION:

That's the best understanding -­

8

MR. ROBERTS:

My answer was intended to say the

9

same thing, that at bottom, the same test applies whether

10

the particular working conditions have been addressed, but

11

with respect to inspected vessels, the working conditions

12

have been addressed comprehensively by the Coast Guard

13

through specific regulations and through general

14

regulations.

15

gaps where workers would be unprotected that the OSH Act

16

would need to -- to step in.

17

And so, there aren't -- there aren't any

But on uninspected vessels, the -- the situation

18

is quite -- quite the reverse and almost the polar

19

opposite where there aren't just little gaps, but there

20

are potentially whole vessels that are almost completely

21

unregulated with respect to occupational safety and

22

health.

23

So, the industry-wide exemption that the Fifth

24

Circuit has crafted here would, as a result, leave many

25

workers unprotected from many hazardous conditions and -­

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and really frustrate the express purpose of the act which

2

is to assure, insofar as possible that every working man

3

and woman in the Nation has safe and healthful working

4

conditions.

5

And moreover, to -- even if there was any

6

ambiguity about how the statutory scheme should work, from

7

looking at its text and from looking at the -- and from

8

the fundamental purpose of the act, the Secretary has

9

interpreted the act this way for 30 years.

It's been the

10

Secretary's longstanding and consisted view.

11

reflected in citations over those 30 years and regulations

12

that the Secretary promulgated in 1972 in a statutorily

13

mandated report to Congress on coordination between the

14

OSH Act and other laws that the Secretary submitted in

15

1980.

16

entitled to deference.

And the Secretary's view would be -- would be

17
18

It's

QUESTION:

That -- that view is also expressed

in the -- in the joint agreement.

19

What -- could you tell me -- I should know this,

20

but I just don't -- how was the joint agreement

21

promulgated, if it was?

22

memorandum of understanding exchanged between the two

23

agencies?

24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

Or is it simply just a private

It was published in the -- in the

Federal Register at -- at the time that it was -- it was

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

entered into, Your Honor.

2

To -- to -- without -- without belaboring the

3

point, turning to the facts that are here briefly, the

4

respondent does not dispute that the Coast Guard hasn't

5

addressed the particular hazards involved here.

6

said before, the only regulations that respondent and

7

amici have -- have pointed to that address the working

8

conditions here are -- are very limited, those addressing

9

the marine sanitation devices, and there is in fact almost

10

no regulation here, so that under any understanding of the

11

term working conditions, any reasonable understanding of

12

what working conditions is under the statute, the Coast

13

Guard hasn't exercised authority over the working

14

conditions here.

15

QUESTION:

And as I

I take it the reason you say we don't

16

have to get into the distinction between the -- the hazard

17

view and the area view is that the area view has been

18

interpreted, I think as you put it, narrowly to take into

19

consideration the particular area in which the particular

20

hazard occurs.

21

Is that about -­

MR. ROBERTS:

That's -- that's one -- one

22

reason.

If -- if the area view was interpreted broadly,

23

it would, in effect, completely eviscerate -­

24

QUESTION:

Yes.

25

MR. ROBERTS:

-- the act because it would mean

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that the regulations of the toilets preempt the -- any

2

regulation of the vessel and expose all those -- all the

3

hazards that might exist on the vessel would not be

4

subject to -- to regulation.

5

narrowly.

6

QUESTION:

So, it has been interpreted

I -- I guess my only question is,

7

given that narrow interpretation, I wonder if there is all

8

that much difference between the hazard view and the -­

9

and the area view as it has been -- been stated.

10

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I -- I think that -- that

11

there is the potential for -- for different results to

12

arise between the two views, even with the -- the narrow

13

interpretation of -- of the area view because the area is

14

identified, say, as the -- the atmosphere on the boat.

15

The atmosphere might be regulated by the Coast Guard with

16

respect to particular injuries that -- that might be

17

caused by problems in the atmosphere like explosion, which

18

it isn't here, but assume that it were.

19

be regulated for -- for other problems that might result

20

from that like respiratory problems, particles that would

21

be in the atmosphere that would get into the -- the

22

workers' lungs.

23

QUESTION:

Yet, it wouldn't

Are you saying that the regulations

24

just have to be an exact -- if the regulation is not an

25

exact duplicate of what OSHA would do, it isn't covered?

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor.

Not that it -­

2

that it has to be an exact duplicate, but that it has to

3

address the same injury, the same kind of injury from the

4

same source in essence.

5

QUESTION:

So, if you regulate smoke -- if the

6

Coast Guard regulates smoke because of some reasons but

7

doesn't address the particulates in the smoke, OSHA could

8

come in and have a regulation for smoke coming out of the

9

vessel?

10

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, if -- if the Coast Guard's

11

regulation didn't address the injury -- the particular

12

injury that would result from the smoke, that the -- that

13

the OSHA regulation was trying to --

14

QUESTION:

Well, what if the -­

15

MR. ROBERTS:

16

QUESTION:

-- to get at.

-- Coast Guard regulations said that

17

we're going to regulate this aspect of smoke.

18

particulates are concerned, we think seamen are -- can

19

take particulates.

20

MR. ROBERTS:

Insofar as

If the Coast Guard had made that

21

determination and expressly concluded that a regulation of

22

that was not warranted, then that would be an exercise of

23

its authority over -- over that working condition and the

24

OSH Act would be displaced.

25

contention that -- that that is what happened here, and

But there's no -- no

have authority to regulate the hazards that are involved

If there are no further questions, I'll reserve
the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK J. VETERS

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10
11

MR. VETERS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

12

The Coast Guard has absolute authority to

13

regulate uninspected vessels, as well inspected vessels,

14

and there's not one iota of difference between the two.

15

Justice O'Connor, if I could go to your question

16

earlier, you're absolutely correct.

17

said that we did not -- the Coast Guard did not have a

18

statute that mirrored the language of -- of the OSH Act.

19

As a result thereof, she concluded that the act was

20

displaced.

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

The ALJ in this case

It sounds like the ALJ's

22

description was probably -- didn't get it quite right, and

23

I take it that your opposing counsel here concedes as

24

much.

25

MR. VETERS:

I would hope so, Your Honor.

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And, Your Honor, to get right to the point, with

2

all due respect to counsel, the Coast Guard has absolutely

3

regulated emergency response.

4

inspected vessels must prepare and post an emergency

5

checkoff list.

MR. VETERS:

We'll find that on page 13 of the

amicus brief on behalf of the AWO, Your Honor.
They had -- they require an -- quote, an
emergency checkoff list.

QUESTION:

Now, is this for uninspected vessels?

MR. VETERS:

The Coast Guard has a statute -- the

It's not a question of

degrees in the statute.

7

OSH Act is displaced.

8

QUESTION:

It's not light exercise, moderate
It's once there has been

Well, there's a difference between

9

having statutory authority and discretion to exercise it.

10

And the Coast Guard may have statutory authority which it

11

chooses not to exercise.

12

understand, your argument is if the Coast Guard has

13

authority and exercises it to any extent, then that's

14

preempted.

15
16

But on -- to the extent that I

Is that -- do I understand that?

MR. VETERS:

That's -- that's fairly correct,

Your Honor.

17

And -- and the only question -- the Government

18

is mischaracterizing the extent of regulation in this

19

case.

20

there is no gap in coverage for -- for worker safety.

21

Coast Guard stepped in and investigated a serious marine

22

accident pursuant to 46 U.S.C. 63.

We had multiple

deaths.

We had property damage

in excess of $100,000.

But let's take a -- perhaps a

practical example in response to Justice Ginsburg's

question.

I would say that's an extreme
But, yes -­

Those are the -- the kinds of

examples that perhaps focus your attention.

13

MR. VETERS:

Your Honor, yes.

I would say that

14

there has been an exercise of authority, and if -- if OSHA

15

has a complaint, it is not properly directed to the Court.

16

It's properly directed to Congress to have the Coast Guard

17

promulgate regulations that address the needs of the

18

seamen.

19

Court to step in and give OSHA -- carve out exception

20

after exception where there are no express regulations.

21

If I may refer to Justice Kennedy's question,

That's the proper complaint.

It's not for this

22

he's -- you're absolutely correct.

OSHA gets -- OSHA gets

23

their jurisdiction in this case from a memorandum of

24

understanding, a peace treaty, an informal memorandum that

25

is not a delegation of law.

That memorandum says, Your

1

Honor -- it says -- the memorandum of understanding says

2

nothing in this MOU pertains to uninspected vessels.

That's what it says.

regulation of inspected vessels, nor does it cede to the

5

Government jurisdiction over uninspected vessels.

Your example about the kitchen knife is

That does not disclaim Coast Guard

if the Coast Guard does not have an express provision -­

in this case, we did not have an express provision

regarding the working conditions of the presence of

natural gas in the atmosphere of an inland drilling barge

-- there's no such creature.

13

does not have that or if the Coast Guard does not

14

articulate a policy that they will not regulate the

15

presence of natural gas in the atmosphere of an inland

16

drilling barge, then OSHA can step in and regulate that.

17

OSHA can step -­

18

QUESTION:

The Government has come in and said

If -- if the Coast Guard

Well, but it seems to me to that that

19

argument -- that position of the Government is just

20

consistent with the statute because the -- the statute

21

applies to working conditions.

22

MR. VETERS:

23

QUESTION:

Correct.

And I -- I would be surprised if the

24

Coast Guard had regulations on -- on drilling barges that

25

related to -- to blowout preventers, mud cavity

3

That's -- that's OSHA stuff not Coast Guard stuff.
MR. VETERS:

Well, Your Honor, they -- what the

4

Coast Guard has is broad, general authority according to

5

14 U.S.C. 2, and they can board an uninspected vessel.

6

They can inspect -- they can investigate any uninspected

7

vessel on the navigable waters of the United States.

8

With that being said, the Coast Guard does not

have to -- to have every minute regulation that tailors

that of the OSH Act to -- to assert their authority in

this case.

QUESTION:

Well, but they said -- the Government

Alderson Reporting Company

1

seemed to me that their claim -- and I'd ask you if that

2

isn't right -- that -- that the only -- the only Coast

3

Guard things that seem to apply at all to the barges, an

4

uninspected barge, had to do with fire extinguishers, life

5

preservers, ventilation for tanks and engines, and also a

6

general requirement that when there's an accident, they

7

look into it to see if a law has been violated.

8

MR. VETERS:

QUESTION:

10

I would disagree.

Is that right?

Which are the ones,

in addition to those that do apply?

11

MR. VETERS:

Those do apply under the subchapter

But before you get into that, I -- I

14

just want to touch base on one thing.

Your -- your

response to the Chief Justice's question.

regulating marine toilets, then they are regulating for

purposes of -- of excluding OSHA jurisdiction.

20

regulating in -- in a later example that you used, running

lights when the barge is being towed, then they're

regulating to the exclusion of OSHA.

MR. VETERS:

QUESTION:

3

MR. VETERS:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes.
They have -- they possess statutory

4

authority to regulate and they have exercised that

5

authority.

6

maybe not in the same exact way OSHA does, maybe not as

7

aggressively, but the preemption cases from this Court say

8

that once there's been an exercise of statutory authority,

9

we don't look at the quality of the regulations, we don't

10

And they've emphasized it in a general way,

look at the consistency or the extent.

11

QUESTION:

No, counsel, but isn't it true that

12

what it really boils down to is whether rules of the road

13

or navigation lights are regulations of working

14

conditions?

15

MR. VETERS:

I believe so, Your Honor.

If you

16

work on a semi-submersible drilling rig and you're being

17

towed at night and having the presence of navigation

18

lights is to protect you from injury from a colliding

19

vessel, I believe that does -- that goes to health and

20

safety of those seamen on that vessel.

21

does.

22

regulations -- the working environment out -- out at sea

is very much different than it is at the, you know,

Congress doesn't like it, Congress can do something about

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. ROBERTS:

With the exception of part 160,

13

which doesn't regulate occupational safety and health,

14

none of the regulations identified by respondent applied

15

to the Mr. Belden as is explained in the -- in the

appendix in our reply brief.

17

Just to -- just to briefly mention part 26,

18

which he started about the emergency checkoff list, that

19

specifically applies to small passenger vessels based on

20

specific authority given to the Coast Guard to regulate

21

small passenger vessels in more detail.

Section 14 U.S.C. 2 on which respondent relies,

2

first of all, as Justice Ginsburg points out, that only

goes to the existence of authority, not to the exercise of

it, and the statute is very clear that -- that the other

5

agency must exercise authority to displace the OSH Act.

QUESTION:

What do you say about his argument

7

that, yes, oh, that may be true in writing, but in fact

8

the people who did investigate this accident was the Coast

Guard?

10

MR. ROBERTS:

The Coast Guard has -- has

11

responsibility for investigating marine accidents.

Investigative authority doesn't necessarily imply that you

Safety Board is an illustration of.

approach that respondent endorses, admitting that

gave it that authority.

The -- the Secretary's view that the Coast Guard

QUESTION:

Are there some drilling platforms on

4

the Outer Continental Shelf which are registered vessels

5

and so are completely under the Coast Guard's jurisdiction

6

as to drilling -­

7

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

A drilling vessel that went

8

to the Outer Continental Shelf, in most cases, would be an

9

inspected mobile oil drilling unit, which the Coast Guard

10

has comprehensive regulations covering.

11

also has regulations specifically addressed to all

12

facilities at the Outer Continental Shelf which include a

13

general duty clause, similar to the OSHA general duty

14

clause, that requires that work places there be free of -­

15

of recognized hazards.

The Coast Guard

In addition, the Interior Department has some

17

regulatory authority out there specifically related to

18

mineral drilling.

QUESTION:

chose, could it allow OSHA a specific regulation of a

concurrent -- sort of a concurrent jurisdiction?

MR. ROBERTS:
