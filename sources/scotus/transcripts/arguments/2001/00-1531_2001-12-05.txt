ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

12

MR. EVANS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Unlike Mr. Smith, Verizon takes the position

13

that these contracts are, in fact, pervasive and Federal,

14

and I'd like to tell you why.

15

requires us to enter into these relationships whether we

16

want to or not.

17

negotiations, it provides that the agreement has to be

18

approved by the State commission but under Federal

19

standards spelled out in the statute.

20

moreover, these agreements are binding not as a matter of

21

State law but as a matter of Federal law, which is

22

provided for in 252(a)(1) of the statute.

It dictates the subject matter of the

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. EVANS:

25

The statute, by its terms,

Once approved,

252(a)(1)?
(a)(1), and finally, and in some

ways most tellingly, every provision of an approved

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

agreement is like a tariff made available automatically to

2

every other carrier that wishes to adopt them, and the

3

Court upheld that in the Iowa utilities case even though

4

it was challenged, but the function of not only the

5

agreement's terms but every interpretation of an

6

agreement's terms has Federal reverberations.

7

not cases that -- with which the Federal Government has

8

washed its hands.
QUESTION:

9

These are

Well, what about Justice Stevens'

10

example in the previous case, do you pay on Tuesday or do

11

you pay on Thursday?

12

MR. EVANS:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think that is a

13

hard question in terms of the way it was put, and I think

14

the answer, to be consistent, is yes it belongs in Federal

15

court, and the reason I say that is because just like a

16

Federal tariff, where there's a question about the payment

17

date, it belongs in Federal court.

18

held that in many cases involving Federal tariffs, one of

19

which we've -- two of which we've dealt with in the brief,

20

one of which is Thurston Motor Lines, which is in 460 U.S.
QUESTION:

21
22

That -- the Court has

How many of these agreements,

negotiated or otherwise, are there Nation-wide?

23

MR. EVANS:

They're -- they're

QUESTION:

Do you have any idea?

MR. EVANS:

QUESTION:

3

MR. EVANS:

-- limited to --- a magnitude.
I'm sorry.

They're limited to the

4

boundaries of the State in most instances, although the

5

negotiations in one State have reverberations for the same

6

two parties in other States, as, for example, with

7

Verizon.
QUESTION:

8
9
10

I'm just wondering how many pure

contract cases are being dumped into Federal courts by
your --

11

MR. EVANS:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. EVANS:

Oh, I see.
100,000?
I think the -- I don't have a

14

number, Justice Scalia.

15

the big issues are resolved there's going to be many of

16

them, and the big issues tend to be like the issue in this

17

case, where the very contract says, on the point in

18

dispute, that the parties agree that reciprocal

19

compensation will be paid only to the extent required by

20

the statute, naming a specific section of the statute.

21

QUESTION:

I can say that I don't think once

Yes, but you say every time there's

22

any dispute on this contract, even as to what date payment

23

should be made, you run into Federal court.

24
25

MR. EVANS:

Well, I mean, yes, but as a

practical matter the issues will not be brought to Federal

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

court unless there's a lot of money involved and the

2

issues are very important for a variety of reasons.

3

not a cost-free proposition to go to Federal court.

4
5

QUESTION:

It's

I thought a tariff -- I mean, you're

talking about a State railroad tariff?

6

MR. EVANS:

No, not a --

7

QUESTION:

8

tariff is a Federal question.

9

they're saying is, here, the structure of this statute is

No, of course a Federal railroad
Nobody doubts that.

What

10

to have State commissions run these agreements, period.

11

Now, of course, they have to be sure that the State

12

commission satisfies certain Federal standards, which

13

might have been minimal but have turned out not to be so

14

minimal.

15

MR. EVANS:

16

QUESTION:

Well -But -- so I don't see how in answer

17

to Justice Stevens -- and I think it does create a

18

problem.

19

detail of this State contract in a Federal court, calling

20

it a Federal question, and once that's so, there does

21

become an issue as to whether Congress bifurcated this and

22

said, as is true of all other State agencies, you have a

23

Federal question, you can go into Federal court.

24

throw them all in the State.

25

I don't see how you can put all the -- every

MR. EVANS:

Or said,

Well --

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. EVANS:

What's your response?
Well, two things, Justice Breyer.

3

First, the -- if you look back at this Court's Federal

4

tariff cases you find that the reason these cases wound up

5

in Federal court, even though lower courts in the cases

6

have almost routinely said this looks to us like a run-

7

of-the-mill state contract issue, is because the tariff

8

itself derives its authority and depends entirely upon the

9

Federal statute.

That's what makes them Federal statutes,

10

because of the Federal Government's interest in the whole

11

process.

12

QUESTION:

13

Transit case, then?

14

MR. EVANS:

What's your answer to the Jackson

Jackson Transit actually was a case

15

involving a contract under the Urban Mass Transit Act in

16

which the Court's analysis proceeded as follows.

17

it said these are inherently, pervasively Federal

18

contracts -- e agree with that -- and but for a contrary

19

indication in the text of the statute or the legislative

20

history we would view those as Federal issues that belong

21

in Federal court, but the Court went on to look first at

22

the text where they found the issue not conclusive, and

23

then to the legislative history where it found that

24

Congress made a specific determination that it did not

25

want these cases in Federal court.

First,

There is no such

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

analogy in the case here, and in fact, if anything, the

2

suggestion is to the contrary, because when Congress did

3

address the question of jurisdiction, albeit it perhaps in

4

narrower terms than we would have liked.

5

that the -- that there's jurisdiction in the Federal

6

courts and that, moreover, State courts are foreclosed

7

from involvement.

8
9

It made clear

It's odd to imagine why an issue like the one in
this case which could just as well have come up at the

10

approval stage, but didn't until the interpretation stage,

11

in part because the Internet exploded in the interim.

12

one case it goes to Federal court, in the other case it

13

goes to State court.

14

sense that Congress would have envisioned that outcome.

15

In

It just doesn't -- it doesn't make

There has been discussion about whether

16

252(e)(6) in some way restricts the provisions of --

17

excuse me, the availability of jurisdiction under section

18

1331, and we think the answer to that is quite clear not

19

only from the general presumption against that kind of

20

restriction that the Court has articulated from time to

21

time, but also because in this statute Congress actually

22

enacted a specific rule of construction in section 601(c)

23

of the act which is actually not in the joint appendix and

24

not codified.

25

152, and what it said there was that nothing in the act

It appears as a -- in the note to 47 U.S.C.

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

should be construed to modify, impair, or supersede

2

Federal law unless expressly so provided.

3

So Congress spoke to what inferences could be

4

drawn from a limitation of jurisdiction in 252(e)(6) and,

5

moreover, there -- the Court has -- I mean, the Congress

6

has shown repeatedly, both in this statute and in other

7

statutes, that when it wishes to preclude review in one

8

court system or another it spells that out specifically,

9

as it does in 252(e)(4) here with respects to States, as

10

it's done in a variety of statutes that we and the

11

Government have cited in our briefs with respect to the

12

other -- with respect to the medicare act.

13

And finally, let me just say a word about the

14

impracticality of the bifurcation that I think Mr. Smith

15

is striving for here.

16

where a case could come up with an interpretation not only

17

of -- not only of the issues we think are binding as a

18

matter of Federal law, but also State law issues that the

19

State put in as part of its review, and from Mr. Smith's

20

point of view, if it's interpretive, it all goes right to

21

State court.

22

It would mean a bizarre separation

In our view, at least all of the Federal issues

23

come to Federal court, and probably the State issues can

24

come along under supplementary jurisdiction, although

25

there may be a -- may not be possible to name the State in

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that context.
QUESTION:

2
3

You say they're going there under

1331?

4

MR. EVANS:

Yes, and this Court once before had

5

before it a bifurcation scheme that had been proposed,

6

actually decided by the Seventh Circuit, as it was in this

7

case, and that's the Bank One case in 516 U.S., and the

8

Court said, this is just too unwieldy and inefficient a

9

system for us to impute the Congress, even if the language

10

were clear, and here the language by no means even

11

supports the outcome.
Unless there are further questions, Your

12
13

Honor --

14

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Evans.

15

Ms. McDowell.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL

17

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER UNITED STATES

18

MS. McDOWELL:

Initially, I'd like to note that

19

although this -- in this case the Court granted certiorari

20

only on the question of jurisdiction under section 1331,

21

if the Court determines that there is a standing problem

22

in the Mathias case, all of the other questions on which

23

the Court granted cert in that case are also presented

24

here, and section 1331 gives the district courts

25

jurisdiction over claims at least that a State commission

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

has acted contrary to controlling Federal law in

2

construing or enforcing an interconnection agreement.

3

Such claims arise under the laws of the United States

4

within the meaning of section 1331.

5

QUESTION:

Excuse me, how does a State

6

commission act contrary to Federal law in construing an

7

agreement that clearly says X, which is contrary to

8

Federal law, but I mean, the State commission is just

9

saying what is the truth.

10
11

How is that acting contrary to

Federal law?
MS. McDOWELL:

For example, let's say that the

12

FCC had issued a different order with respect to Internet

13

calls than it actually did.

14

no agreement under section 252 can be construed as

15

providing reciprocal compensation for Internet service

16

provider --

17

QUESTION:

They wouldn't say that.

18

mean, can be construed?

19

I mean, that's fine.

20

What if the FCC had said that

MS. McDOWELL:

What do you

Can be enforced, which provides,

Well, it -- the commission

21

conceivably could have said if the contract is silent on

22

the specific subject --

23

QUESTION:

Oh -- yes.

24

MS. McDOWELL:

25

In any event, one can envision circumstances in

-- or whatever.

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

which -QUESTION:

Okay, but you -- but sure, I mean, if

3

you posit that the Federal regulation says no contract

4

shall be construed this way, no matter what it says, no

5

matter how clearly it says that, then I agree with you,

6

the commission would be violating Federal law, but let's

7

assume a more normal FCC regulation which just says that

8

this particular disposition is unlawful, even if you do

9

agree with it, okay, and all that happens is that the

10

State commission says, yes, they're -- that's what they

11

agreed to, okay.

Now, how does that violate State law?

12

MS. McDOWELL:

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. McDOWELL:

It may not.

It may be --

Federal law, excuse me.
It may be the rare case in which

15

a State commission decision interpreting a negotiated

16

agreement will -- can be alleged to violate Federal law.

17

I think the questions are more likely to come up with

18

respect to interpretation of terms of an arbitrated

19

agreement where the State commission was --

20

QUESTION:

What is the actual question before

21

the commission?

22

their agreement, and nothing more than that, or is it

23

something with more legal overtones to it?

24
25

Is it, what did these parties mean by

MS. McDOWELL:

This has been sort of a moving

target, because the FCC's orders have been subject to

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

review and have been vacated, so -- but the claim was that

2

under the commission's initial order with respect to

3

Internet calls

4
5
6

QUESTION:

No, I meant the rules of the State

commission, not the FCC.
MS. McDOWELL:

Well, the State commission, after

7

looking at the FCC's orders and the statute, decided that

8

there was -- the FCC had said it was permissible to adopt

9

either rule, to read these agreements either as providing

10

reciprocal compensation for these calls or not, and gave

11

some factors that State commissions might look to in

12

construing agreements, and that is what it did.

13

QUESTION:

For instance, if you go to a State

14

court, I'm A, I'm suing B because we have a contract, the

15

final decision of the State court isn't just necessarily

16

the parties agree to this.

17

say, well, is this -- is there any State law prohibition

18

against this kind of an agreement, and what are the

19

results in this particular case, does A owe B money.

20

the commission, State commission have that broad an area

21

to deal with the contracts under this statute?

22

MS. McDOWELL:

They have to go further and

Does

Yes, and certainly it's subject

23

to the standards of 252(d) with respect to assuring that

24

the public interest, convenience, and necessity is served,

25

and it needs to look at the polices as articulated in the

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Telecommunications Act and by the FCC in its regulations

2

and orders, so it's a broader mandate than just looking at

3

the parties' intent, yes.

4

Whether this will always present an issue of

5

Federal law is, of course, not clear, but where there is a

6

claim that what the State commission has done is contrary

7

to the 1996 act, to the FCC's orders under the act, or to

8

some other provision of Federal, constitutional, or

9

statutory law --

10

QUESTION:

Ms. McDowell, would you clarify what

11

you define as the Federal question in this case?

12

were a lot of arguments that were made by Verizon like,

13

this is a Federal tariff, in effect, like the State

14

commissioner simply is saying that it is for this purpose

15

a Federal agency.

16

There

In your brief, the only thing that I recall --

17

maybe I got this altogether wrong -- was, you said the

18

Federal question is an FCC order which would be

19

controlling, and that FCC order, it turns out, has been

20

vacated by the D.C. Circuit, so I'm really left at sea

21

about what is the Federal question.

22

MS. McDOWELL:

Verizon's complaint, and that's

23

in the court of appeals joint appendix, was really quite

24

bare bones.

25

vacated, as you mentioned, and to other principles of

It alluded to the FCC order that's since been

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Federal law, and it just simply alleged that the Maryland

2

commission's decision was inconsistent with Federal law,

3

also with the language of the agreement, and is arbitrary

4

and capricious, so it was a very general claim.
The district court construed Verizon's claim as

5
6

being that the Public Service Commission's order is in

7

direct conflict with a declaratory ruling of the FCC, and

8

that's on pages 1 to 2 of the court of appeals joint

9

appendix.

I think the principal --

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. McDOWELL:

12
13

That ruling has been vacated.
That's true.

There's now a new

ruling, and that's being litigated in the D.C. Circuit.
I think as currently articulated Verizon

14

contends that among other things the Maryland commission's

15

order is contrary to section 252(a)(1) of the act, which

16

requires these agreements to be binding, and the

17

allegation is that the commission has violated that

commission by writing additional terms into a party's

agreement.

like, of just what you think -- I mean, on the overall

creatures of the Federal law, so much so that everything

about them is Federal, they all go into Federal court.

The opposite view, no, everything about them goes into

The exception is

That puts 98 percent of the cases in State

Choice 3, the compromise, which is some form of
which I think you're advocating.

That would have to be,

10

the Federal questions come into Federal court under either

11

252 or 1331.

12

they're in Federal court, the Federal questions, and where

13

they're all mixed up with State interpretation you have

14

three choices.

15

their supplementary jurisdiction, 2) they have some form

16

of abstention, to wait, 3) they do something else.

17

don't know what it is, all right.

18

let's call that a hybrid approach.

I don't know if it makes any difference, but

Each Federal judge is on his own.

But in other words,

I want to know which of those three positions

20

the Government takes, and I think it's the last one, and I

21

want to know precisely how all this works out.

I wish I could tell you precisely

how it would work out in every case.

QUESTION:

You know your favorite view of it.

2

MS. McDOWELL:

Yes.

When there is a claim that

a State commission order is contrary to controlling

Federal law, that claim should come into Federal court.

If the only claim is a violation of State law, it should

go into State court.

supplemental jurisdiction, but then there's a question of

9

the State officials' sovereign immunity, assuming that

If there are both kinds of claims,

10

they're a party and they haven't waived sovereign

11

immunity, because the State law claims can't be

12

adjudicated under -- according to Pennhurst in Federal

13

court.

14

So the optimal solution in many of these cases

15

may be to bifurcate, or may be to bring the case in State

16

court, and the State courts, of course, are competent to

17

hear these cases as well, but we don't think that Congress

18

intended to preclude the opportunity of parties to go to

19

Federal court on these claims when they have a Federal

20

claim under --

21

QUESTION:

Let's put the question the other way.

22

Why would Congress have wanted to provide for a bifurcated

23

scheme, which we know is going to lead to all kinds of

24

pleadings chicanery in order to get it into one court or

25

another court, and we're going to have endless disputes

kind of a system?

3

Why would Congress have wanted that

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, it is the system that we

4

have generally, Your Honor.

Parties do have the option of

5

taking their claims to State court or to Federal court,

6

and Congress may have been --

7

QUESTION:

But I think you're -- aren't you

8

positing a system in which there -- I was going to say,

9

aren't you positing a system in which, as a system, we

10

assume there is going to be some kind of a system of

11

utility regulation, and there isn't going to be a system.

12

Some utility regulation through contract interpretation is

13

going to be done in State courts, some of it's going to he

14

done in Federal courts, parties in essentially the same

15

situation are going to be making inconsistent choices, and

16

you're not going to have a resulting coherent system.

17

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, we already know, of course,

18

under section 252(e)(4) of the act that a number of these

19

cases are going to be in Federal court, and what seems

20

particularly irrational is that if there was exclusive

21

Federal court jurisdiction over some category of cases and

22

exclusive State court jurisdiction over the same sorts of

23

issues when they arise in an interpretation context as

24

opposed to an approval context, so that seems clearly what

25

Congress could not have meant.

QUESTION:

MS. McDOWELL:

17

Well, I think this particular

issue involves large amounts of money --

14

16

What's your

Right.
-- tens if not hundreds of

millions of dollars, and that's why it's being litigated.
QUESTION:

But are there similar issues bouncing

18

around in State and Federal courts, or is this sort of the

19

only thing they're fighting about?

20

MS. McDOWELL:

I wouldn't say it's the only

thing they've been fighting about, and I'm not familiar

with all the cases that may have been brought, but

certainly these are the leading categories of cases at the

concern whether the State commission has --

QUESTION:

At the approval stage, there's no

doubt about where those go.
MS. McDOWELL:

Right.

It also should be noted

6

that most of these interconnection agreements build in

7

some form of alternative dispute resolution process that

8

there is some negotiation between the parties.

9

there is formal arbitration to resolve these disputes, so

it's not necessarily clear that they will all proceed

through this particular process.

of this in the hybrid -- in the hybrid system that we're

describing as concerning Justice Souter, that I agree with

agencies after the Chicago case.

17

in Chicago, and you may have come across this in your

18

reading, or just experience, would be there would be,

19

then, a lot of cases, because it covers every State

agency, where people would run into Federal court on a

21

Federal question related to a basically State matter, and

they'd bring in and get review through the supplementary

25

Has that happened?

Now, one of the concerns

I mean, is this the norm?

say, the 40 million State proceedings that go on every

2

week?

3

MS. McDOWELL:

I don't think there are nearly

4

that many State proceedings.

5

involving reciprocal compensation for Internet calls, yes,

6

parties have asserted, as they have here, State law claims

7

as well as Federal law claims, and some Federal courts, at

least where there's been no objection raised by the State

commission, relating to sovereign immunity, have exercised

In some of these cases

supplemental jurisdiction over these claims.
QUESTION:

Ms. McDowell, regarding your earlier

12

answer to Justice Souter as to why Congress would have

13

wanted such a crazy, hybrid system, I mean, this piece of

14

legislation was an extraordinary intrusion of the Federal

15

Government into local utility regulation, wasn't it?

16

mean, this is an area that has traditionally been

17

regulated by the States.

18

interstate communications, but here they are getting into

19

local communication regulation.

20

MS. McDOWELL:

21

QUESTION:

I

The Government has regulated

But this isn't their --

And was there not a feeling in

22

Congress that we should take as little as possible away

23

from the States, if they want to continue their

24

traditional regulation, and if it ended up in a hodge

25

podge system, maybe many in Congress said, so be it.

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

that not a sufficient explanation?
MS. McDOWELL:

That might indeed be a sufficient

3

explanation.

4

local competition surely has traditionally been regulated

5

by the States, this act dealt with something a little

6

different, encouraging competition between local carriers,

7

which was quite new at the time this 1996 act was adopted.

8
9

I would preface this by saying that although

QUESTION:

Well, it may be a new Federal policy,

but to regulate concededly local telecommunications was a

10

major step for the Federal Government, and maybe they

11

didn't want to get into the business of doing that, which

12

is why they leave it optional to the States whether they

13

want to implement it or not.

14

didn't want to take on these things, neither at the FCC

15

level nor, as far as we know, at the Federal district

16

court level.

17

MS. McDOWELL:

The Federal Government

Well, it certainly is clear from

18

the act that Congress hoped that State commissions would

19

want to regulate these agreements to bring their expertise

20

with local conditions and with local telecommunications to

21

bear, although Congress, of course, also gave States the

22

option of allowing the FCC to do that.

23

QUESTION:

Let me ask the question Justice

24

Scalia doesn't want to ask, and that is, do you have any

25

legislative history that indicates that they really did

don't -- I haven't heard anyone getting into the

legislative background to indicate that they didn't.

7

you have anything?
MS. McDOWELL:

8
9

Not really, no.

The only

arguable legislative history that seems relevant is that

10

the State utility commissioners through their

11

organizations came to Congress and said, we've started to

12

do this, we would like to have a role in this, and

13

Congress apparently heard them in enacting -QUESTION:

14

What about the provision of the

15

statute itself, that says if the States want to do it,

16

they can do it?

17

the Federal Government -- isn't that -- don't you start

18

off with a hodge podge?

19

some places, Federal regulation other places?

On the other hand, if they don't do it,

MS. McDOWELL:

20

It's going to be State regulation

Yes, and that all argues all the

more for Federal court review under 1331 to assure some

uniformity in the application of the Federal standards in

the act.

2

that subsequently raise some issues of State law

3

interpretation, of interpretation that can go into State

court?

MS. McDOWELL:

I believe that if the FCC

those decisions would be reviewable only in the courts of

QUESTION:

On the Eleventh Amendment point, if

we find that there's a waiver under 252, rather than Ex

of determination of State law issues?

15

MS. McDOWELL:

It might or might not.

One would

think the extent of the waiver would be governed by

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN S. MILLER

5

ON BEHALF OF THE STATE RESPONDENT

6
7

MS. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

8

I'd like to start out with giving you a little

9

factual background of what the commission considered and

10

what Verizon appealed.

11

order saying that ISP calls to ISP's were largely

12

interstate.

13

that had already approved agreements, the State commission

14

was to look at contract principles to see if the parties

15

should be bound by their previous agreements, and whether

16

their previous agreements should be interpreted to include

17

calls to ISP's being local.

18

commission did in this instance.

19

Essentially, the FCC issued an

That order also said, for those companies

That's what the Maryland

Verizon appealed to Federal district court

20

raising two issues.

The first issue was that, under

21

Maryland contract law, the commission had misinterpreted

22

the contract.

23

That was clear from their motion for summary judgment,

24

which is part of the record of the case, but I don't

25

believe it's included in any appendix to the case.

That's the first issue that they raised.

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The second issue they raised is, after the

2

commission had interpreted the contract principles, the

3

commission determined that the FCC order required them to

4

develop an intercarrier compensation mechanism until such

5

time as the FCC had developed its own compensation

6

mechanism.
Now, what Verizon said was that the commission

7
8

was wrong, that the FCC didn't require that, that they

9

made it discretionary for the commission, and those were

10

the only two issued raised by Verizon in this case.
QUESTION:

11

Excuse me, Verizon was objecting to a

12

misinterpretation of Maryland contract law, but up here

13

they're saying that this contract isn't governed by

14

Maryland contract law, but rather by Federal contract law.

15

MS. MILLER:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. MILLER:

Their -Is that a change of position?
Their claim -- what they argued on

18

their motion for summary judgment was that Maryland

19

contract law became Federal common law, and that thus it

20

was --

21
22

QUESTION:
common law, I see.

23

MS. MILLER:

24

QUESTION:

25

Maryland contract law became Federal

That was their argument.
So that we have a Federal contract

law that consists of Federal adoption of the common law of

Alderson Reporting Company

each of the 50 States that --

MS. MILLER:

3

QUESTION:

4

(Laughter.)

5

MS. MILLER:

6
7

Whatever their contract law is.
I understand it, I guess.

So those were the two issues that

were raised by Verizon.
QUESTION:

I just want to be sure I understand

8

the thrust of your point.

That's entirely consistent with

9

the argument we heard this morning, though, is it not,

10

because they're basically saying it's all a matter of

11

Federal law.

12

MS. MILLER:

I just want to make clear that what

13

they were raising was a contract issue.

14

that all contract issues are also Federal law now.

15

QUESTION:

16

MS. MILLER:

They're claiming

Right.
I just wanted to make sure the

17

Court was clear that what -- the sole thing they were

18

raising was a contract issue.

19

QUESTION:

20

the district court level, if I understand you correctly.

21

MS. MILLER:

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. MILLER:

24
25

But they made the same argument at

That -Yes -It had become Federal common law,

that's correct.
QUESTION:

And the Federal law is borrowed law

Alderson Reporting Company

1

so far as it involves the interpretation of a contract.

2

MS. MILLER:

That's correct.

3

Now, the Fourth Circuit dismissed the 1331 claim

4

on the basis of three alternative grounds.

5

ground was that in relying on Jackson Transit they found

6

that Verizon's claim did not meet the arising under

7

standard contained in 1331.

8

Circuit, the fact that interconnection agreements are

9

creations of Federal law did not in and of itself raise a

10
11

The first

According to the Fourth

substantial Federal question.
The Fourth Circuit also relied on Shoshone

12

Mining, which said that Federal question jurisdiction

13

isn't established where local rules or customs would

14

govern the result, which is what we have here, of course.

15

Maryland contract law is what governed the result here,

16

that under -- specifically under 252 the negotiating

17

parties had absolutely no obligation to include anything

18

from 251 and 252 in their contract.

19

negotiated contracts are kind of taken away from those

20

aspects of the Telecommunications Act.

21

QUESTION:

For that reason,

Would you think the -- would you

22

assert that the result would be different and you would

23

take a different position if this were not a voluntarily

24

negotiated contract?

25

MS. MILLER:

We still believe it wouldn't come

13

Mr. Evans offered one distinction,

14

that there was substantial legislative history there

15

saying that Congress wanted these actions to be brought in

MS. MILLER:

17

I disagree with that reading of

18

Jackson Transit

They noted one sentence that they said

19

led them to believe that Congress wouldn't have wanted

20

these.

21

however, that have interpreted Jackson Transit to say that

22

where State law governs the decision before the Court,

23

then there is no Federal question jurisdiction regardless

24

of whether the contract terms were required to be

25

incorporated or not.

There are also several other circuit court cases,

1

QUESTION:

I saw two Federal questions, and

2

either way it seems Federal.

3

Stevens said, was there's some words in this contract.

4

This contract is a creature of Federal law.

5

interpretation of every one of those words is a Federal

6

question, whatever source of law that you might come --

7

turn to to figure out what Federal law is, whether it's

8

Maryland, or whether it's Alaska, or whether it's some

9

totally different place.

His first point, as Justice

The

Argument 2, that the Federal Communications

10
11

Commission in a series of decisions, whatever may be true

12

of other words in the contract, has said that these words

13

in the contract, A, B, C, D, mean, and then he gets the

14

result he wants, all right, so he's looking both to the

15

F -- which obviously the FCC does have the power to do

16

that, doesn't it?
I mean, it could say as a matter of FCC rule any

17
18

contract that has words A, B, and C, must be interpreted

19

to mean thus and so under this statute.

20

MS. MILLER:

21

QUESTION:

I believe it -Okay.

Now, it seemed to me they're

22

making some combination of those two arguments.

23

right?

24
25

QUESTION:

Is that

Excuse me, it can say that before the

fact or after the fact?

Do you think the FCC has the

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

power to say that after a contract has already been

voluntarily negotiated?

3

MS. MILLER:

QUESTION:

Well -And the FCC can say, as a matter of

Federal law, what the parties agreed to voluntarily is

6

this, even though it plainly is not that?

7

MS. MILLER:

QUESTION:

9

MS. MILLER:

10

Can the FCC do that?
I don't believe they can, and I

think that was what was the problem with -QUESTION:

11
12

I think --

If I got us into this, I'd modify the

question.

13

(Laughter.)

14

QUESTION:

It's simply a matter of, wouldn't

15

that state a Federal question?

16

answer is, but somebody who says just what I said has

17

raised a Federal question, haven't they, just as somebody

18

who says this contract is a creature of Federal law, the

19

word interpretation is Federal, has raised a Federal

20

question, and you would reply, you're wrong about what the

21

answer to the question is, but that's different from

22

saying you haven't raised a Federal question.
MS. MILLER:

23

I don't know what the

I think under Jackson Transit what

24

they've said is that you haven't raised a Federal

25

question.

That's what Jackson Transit said.

If you take

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a contract, and your only basis of the contract was that

2

it was required by Federal law, then that doesn't even

3

raise a Federal question.

4

QUESTION:

They're not saying it was required by

5

Federal law.

They're saying that the words of the

6

contract, what they mean is Federal law.
MS. MILLER:

7

That would be a closer question as

8

to whether that actually raises a substantial Federal

9

question regarding whether -- because it would obviously

10

limit a State commission's interpretation.

11

commission could not interpret the word in a different

12

way.

13

The State

The second basis for the Fourth Circuit's

14

dismissal of the 1331 claim was essentially based on this

15

Court's Merrell Dow decision.

16

found that where a Federal statute includes a limited

17

grant of jurisdiction, that any other broader grant of

18

jurisdiction would flout the intent of Congress.

19

that, the Fourth Circuit found that 252(e)(6) was a

20

limited grant of jurisdiction and that therefore it should

21

not allow suit to be brought under 1331.

22

In Merrell Dow, the court

Based on

The respon -- the petitioners have argued that

23

the rule is otherwise that essentially the courts have

24

this broad grant authority unless there is some

25

limitation, but all the cases cited by the respondents

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

involve Federal agencies, and there's a distinction here,

2

because what the Federal agencies were arguing was

3

essentially that there was absolutely no review of what

4

was at issue, that you couldn't bring it under 1331, there

5

was no other statute, essentially it was a discretionary

6

act of the agency, and you couldn't bring it, and in that

7

sense the Court --

8

QUESTION:

Oh, now --

9

QUESTION:

Your position is that there's no

10

jurisdiction under 252, and there's also no jurisdiction

11

under 1331.

Is that right?

12

MS. MILLER:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And is it because 252 by implication

14

prohibits 1331 jurisdiction, or just that 1331 isn't broad

15

enough to cover this?

16

MS. MILLER:

It's that 252 represents a limited

17

grant of jurisdiction on behalf of Congress, and that

18

Congress only intended such a limited grant of

19

jurisdiction, and that therefore to use a broader grant of

20

jurisdiction such as 1331 would defy congressional intent.

21

QUESTION:

In other words, Congress intended

22

Federal jurisdiction over review of approval agreements,

23

but didn't intend Federal jurisdiction over anything else?

24

MS. MILLER:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct.
What do you say to the provision that

your brother quoted to the effect that there will be no

2

modification of Federal statutory law unless it's express

3

modification, which would preserve the full extent of

4

1331, I suppose?

5

MS. MILLER:

It -- but it also preserves the --

6

how 1331 has been analyzed in the past, and how 1331 has

7

been analyzed under Merrell Dow is that you look at the

8

statute, and if the statute has a limited grant of

9

authority, then that's congressional intent that that be

10

the only authority, so 601 didn't change the analysis, it

11

just says you use the same analysis, and in this case the

12

analysis is, under Merrell Dow, there is a jurisdictional

13

statute in the statute at issue, so no other statutes --

14

so 1331, which is a broader grant of jurisdiction, should

15

not be used.

16

QUESTION:

What about section 251 of the

17

Telecommunications Act, which does seem to have a lot of

18

standards for these agreements.

19

Federal question?

20

MS. MILLER:

Wouldn't that make it a

Well, but they're -- for negotiated

21

agreements they're not required to incorporate anything

22

involving 251 and 252, so they've made the choice to not

23

include those Federal standards by negotiating an

24

agreement rather than having it arbitrated, so in that

25

sense, no, it would not raise a Federal question.

1

QUESTION:

We're told that the agreements that

2

are negotiated are not very far distant from what the

3

standards are under the -- of the statute.

4

so set up that the parties will come down to pretty much

5

what's in the statute.

6

MS. MILLER:

The thing is

Is that not so?
I don't know that it's so in any --

7

in every instance.

In this instance, for a matter of

8

fact, the initial contract at issue with MFS and Telenet,

9

Verizon actually agreed to a reciprocal compensation rate

10

that was higher than the commission's arbitrated rate.

11

Now, for what reason, I don't know.

12

traded something else for that.

13

Presumably they

So it's not necessarily so that whatever's in

14

the statute the parties agree to, and if the parties agree

15

to that, then they've chosen to agree to that rather than

16

go to the State commission and say, Federal law requires

17

this, we don't want to agree to it, but we recognize that

18

you have the authority to order us to do it.

19

QUESTION:

So you say that what has been created

20

is this weird system in which challenges to the

21

interpretation or validity of negotiated agreements can't

22

go to Federal court, but if it's a challenge to an

23

arbitrated agreement, it does go to Federal court?

24
25

MS. MILLER:

Well, we think it would not end up

in Federal court for other reasons, but we -- but --

1

QUESTION:

What are the other reasons, because

2

it makes some difference to me whether there's going to be

3

this strange line between negotiated and --

4
5

MS. MILLER:

Well, if you're talking about 13 --

going into Federal court under 1331 --

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. MILLER:

Yes.
-- our argument would be the

8

private right of action argument, that 1331, you have to

9

look at the four court factors and things like that, and

10

that therefore those wouldn't end up under 1331 either,

11

and also the same argument --

12

QUESTION:

But then you're blending together two

14

QUESTION:

Right.

15

QUESTION:

-- that I think this Court's

13

things --

16

decisions keep separate.

17

question jurisdiction.

One is 1331, general Federal

18

QUESTION:

Right.

19

QUESTION:

That you have to have first, and then

20

do you have, would you survive a 12(b)(6) motion, do you

21

have a claim for relief, and you treated that in your

22

brief, and now again, as though they're the same question,

23

and they're not.

24
25

MS. MILLER:

I don't believe, in answer to

Justice Scalia's question, I was treating them the same.

37
Alderson Reporting Company

1

He asked me what other issues would we raise to say that

2

this arbitration case shouldn't be in this Court, and that

3

was one of the issues we raised.

4

I believe that there are cases that essentially

5

say that a cause of action is a matter, a matter of

6

subject matter jurisdiction.

7

courts that have interpreted this Court's Merrell Dow case

8

in that manner, but I don't think it's necessary for the

9

Court to even reach this, because I think the cases can be

There are several circuit

10

upheld based on the Fourth Circuit analysis, and any one

11

of the three alternatives raised.
QUESTION:

12
13

in Steel Co.,

14

MS. MILLER:

15

QUESTION:

16

I thought we wrestled with that issue

And -You're not going to drag us back into

that again, are you?
MS. MILLER:

17

Do you want to know what the Fourth

18

Circuit -- how the Fourth Circuit distinguished your Steel

19

Co. case?

20
21

QUESTION:

Yes.

I defended in Steel Co., so I'd

like to know that.

22

(Laughter.)

23

MS. MILLER:

What the Fourth Circuit claimed you

24

were doing in Steel Co. is that you were distinguishing

25

between Article III subject matter jurisdiction, which had

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to be decided before you reached the merits, and statutory

2

subject matter jurisdiction, which you didn't have to

3

decide before you reached the merits under that

4

hypothetical jurisdiction issue.

5

Circuit has interpreted Steel Co.

6

That's how the Fourth

So in this instance I believe the petitioners

7

are wrong in their analysis that you have 1331

8

jurisdiction unless Congress specifically precludes 1331

9

jurisdiction.

The only cases that has occurred has been

10

with regard to Federal agencies, as I mentioned earlier,

11

and that was because to find that 1331 wasn't broad enough

12

to encompass a Federal agency would mean that there would

13

be absolutely no review, so I think that there is a

14

distinction that is important between the two cases.
The final reason the Fourth Circuit found that

15
16

the 1331 claim should be dismissed was the Rooker-Feldman

17

doctrine.

18

statutory interpretation element and a federalism element.

19

The statutory interpretation element is that 1257 grants

20

original jurisdiction to this Court and this Court alone

21

over State -- I'm sorry.

22

appellate review of State court decisions, and that the

23

Federal district courts only have review over original

24

actions, original civil actions, and that by implication,

25

therefore, Federal district courts have no review over

Under that doctrine, it involves essentially a

1257 alone grants this Court

1
2

State court actions.
QUESTION:

Well, how does that fit in with City

3

of Chicago, where a Federal district court did sit on

4

those supplemental jurisdiction claims as a reviewer of a

5

State administrative agency?

6

MS. MILLER:

I think that's distinguishable

7

because in the case you referred to the district court

8

already had jurisdiction over Federal claims that were

9

totally separate and apart from the on-record

10

administrative review.

11

could have been brought without actually reviewing the

12

record and the order in the case.

13

Federal district court already had that jurisdiction over

14

those claims that this Court found it could exercise its

15

supplemental jurisdiction and also hear those claims that

16

involved the on-the-record State court -- actually, I

17

think it was actually a local administrative agency in

18

that case, but the on-the-record review.

19

Essentially, the Federal claims

It was because the

So I think this is different in that Verizon

20

raises no claims that are separate and apart from the on-

21

the-record review and decisions of the Maryland Public

22

Service Commission, so in this instance the Federal

23

district court will be acting as an appellate court,

24

particularly since I believe virtually every Federal

25

district court that has considered the issue has said in

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

telecommunications cases it's not a de novo review, it is

2

an on-the-record review, so in this instance they will be

3

performing an appellate action rather than an original

4

civil action.

5

QUESTION:

Could you -- in your opinion, if

6

there is -- suppose it isn't a communications case, it's

7

common, isn't it, if, say the California State Coastal

8

Authority, a State agency, orders someone to do thus-and-

9

so, they could say in Federal court, that order violates a

10

Federal statute, all right.

11

Now, in your case, if there were plaintiff just

12

like this one, and he went into a Federal court and said,

13

your State court order violates a Federal statute -- so in

14

other words, suppose it were much more clear, are you

15

saying there, there's no jurisdiction?

16

MS. MILLER:

There, there would be Federal

17

jurisdiction if the basis of that claim didn't require the

18

appellate -- the Federal district court, excuse me, to

19

actually -- to review the determinations of the Maryland

20

Public Service Commission to reach the conclusion that

21

their order violated a Federal law, essentially --

22

QUESTION:

Well, there may often be, with the

23

California State Coastal Commission somebody says, this is

24

a taking of my property, or something simpler.

25

could be that you have to look at the underlying State

order in order to deal with the Federal question.
MS. MILLER:

2

To a certain extent you would be

3

looking at the Federal -- the State order, but you would

4

not be overturning the State order on the basis that the

5

State commission found.

6

found this, but the problem is, what you found now

7

implicates this, so -QUESTION:

8
9

You would be saying, yes, you

Well, but what if the Federal

objection was raised at the administrative level, so that

10

the administrator, the administrative body had said, no

11

Federal problem.

12

would be no, they can't go into Federal court.

In that case, I take it, your answer

MS. MILLER:

13

That would be correct.

They would

14

have to go through the State court proceedings in that,

15

and have it resolved in that manner.
QUESTION:

16

May I ask you a procedural question?

17

I hate to do this, but it seemed to be in the case.

18

client's the commission.

19

MS. MILLER:

20

QUESTION:

21

MS. MILLER:

23

QUESTION:

25

That's correct.
Now, it's my understanding that the

commission first raised an Eleventh Amendment problem.

22

24

Your

That's correct.
And then it was dismissed from the

case.
MS. MILLER:

We were not dismissed from the case

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The whole case was dismissed.

2

QUESTION:

3

The whole case -- how did the 1331

come up, then?

4

MS. MILLER:

5

QUESTION:

Well -It decided as to your client, you're

6

out of it because of Eleventh Amendment.

7

of them they were out of it because of 1331, or --

8
9

MS. MILLER:

No, Your Honor.

As to the rest

At the Federal

district court level, essentially the court decided that

10

we had Eleventh Amendment immunity and that we were

11

indispensable parties and, as such, the entire case had to

12

be dismissed.

13

The Federal district court also addressed the

14

1331 issue and found that it would not imply a private

15

right of action, and that the -- and that his Eleventh

16

Amendment analysis probably would pertain to the 1331

17

claim as well.

18
19

That's all I have, unless there are any other
questions.

Thank you, Ms. Miller.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. EVANS

23

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN NO. 00-1531

24
25

MR. EVANS:

I would just like to read two

provisions, very short provisions from the contract that's

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

being interpreted here.

The first says, reciprocal

2

compensation is as described in the act.

3

as described in the act means, as described in or required

4

by the act, meaning the '96 telecom act, and as from time

5

to time interpreted in the duly authorized rules and

6

regulations of the FCC or the State commission.

The second says,

Now, if you look at the decision of the agency

7
8

here, the State agency here, it is full of a discussion of

9

what it means, what reciprocal compensation is required

10

under the act.

That was the basis for the interpretation.

The effect of the interpretation was to say,

11
12

even though the act doesn't require it, you have to

13

provide it, because your agreement says you're going to

14

provide it, and we -- this statement says just the

15

opposite.
