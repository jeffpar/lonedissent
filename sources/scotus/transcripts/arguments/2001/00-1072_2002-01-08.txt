ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The relation-back rule for verification under

11

section 1601.12(b) is a proper exercise of the authority

12

granted to the EEOC under section 713 of title VII to

13

promulgate procedural regulations.

14

consistent with the language of section 706.

15

requires that a charge be verified, and the statute also

16

requires that a charge be filed within 180 or 300 days of

17

the act of discrimination.

The regulation is
Title VII

But as Judge Luttig correctly observed below,

18
19

these two statutory requirements are independent of each

20

other.

21

180 or 300 days, but it applies those deadlines only to

22

when, quote, a charge must be filed.

23

does not purport to establish a deadline for verification.

24

Conversely, section 706(b) requires verification, but it

25

contains no deadline for doing so.

Specifically, 706(e)(1) establishes deadlines of

Section 706(e)(1)

That omission is

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

particularly significant because other requirements which

2

are contained in 706(b) do have deadlines.

3

QUESTION:

What -- what about the other elements

4

that -- that are required by the statute to be in the --

5

in the charge?

6

Surely the commission has to serve notice of the

7

charge, including the date and place and circumstances of

8

the alleged unlawful employment practice.

9

statutory provision implicitly a requirement that the

Isn't that

10

charge contain the date, place, and circumstances of the

11

alleged unlawful practice?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

12

I wouldn't go quite that far.

13

The -- the commission's interpretation of that, which is

14

embodied in section 1601.12(b), concludes that a charge is

15

sufficient if it identifies the parties and contains a

16

description of the alleged discriminatory practice.
QUESTION:

17

Well, how -- how can -- how can the

18

statute be complied with?

19

2000e-5(b), clearly says that the commission on receiving

20

a charge shall serve a notice of it, paren, including the

21

date, place, and circumstances of the alleged unlawful

22

employment practice on the employer.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

23

I mean, the statute,

Well, it does -- it does so

24

provide.

But it also provides that the -- that the charge

25

shall contain the information and be in the form required

by the commission.

2

particular information.

3

in practice --

4

QUESTION:

The commission does not require that
Ordinarily it could be inferred

So, you think the charge doesn't even

5

have to -- because the commission hasn't chosen to require

6

that, a charge doesn't even have to contain the date,

7

circumstances, and place of the alleged --

8

MR. SCHNAPPER:

9

QUESTION:

Well, the commission has --

What does it have to contain?

10

MR. SCHNAPPER:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SCHNAPPER:

The regulation requires --

I have been discriminated against?
I understand the regulation to

13

require more specificity than that.

14

is not posed, of course, by this case.

15

the specificity of the information in this letter.

16

did --

17

QUESTION:

No.

That -- that question
No one questions

I understand that.

It

But -- but

18

what you say about -- about the requirement or -- or

19

nonrequirement of -- of oath, of it being under oath, I

20

think you -- you're going to have to logically say about

21

other requirements or, as you think them, nonrequirements

22

of the charge.

23

hand in hand.

24
25

I don't see how -- how the two don't go

MR. SCHNAPPER:

I -- I think that you have to

read -- well, the commission's view is that there is an

5
Alderson Reporting Company

1

irreducible minimum that has to be in a charge.

2

just file a piece of paper called -- that says charge and

3

fill in the blanks later.

4
5

QUESTION:
position?

6

Why?

You can't

Why does it come to that

It just made it up?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

The statute expressly provides

7

that the commission can specify what information needs to

8

be in a charge, and that's the -- that's the answer they

9

give.

10

QUESTION:

I see.

Not because there's any

11

statutory compulsion, but just in its -- in its wisdom and

12

beneficence, the commission has decided that there has to

13

be a certain minimal amount of information in the charge,

14

not because the statute implies that there must be.

15

MR. SCHNAPPER:

I -- I don't -- Federal Register

16

recounts any -- any explanation, but it seems to me it

17

would be logical for the commission to have looked at the

18

provision to which you refer in -- in framing the -- the

19

requirements it has.

20

QUESTION:

Right, but if it looked at the

21

provision to which I refer, it would say a charge has to

22

-- we're not going to bother an employer and require him

23

to come back with a response unless you haven't just come

24

in and said, I've been discriminated against.

25

going to ask the employer, has this person been

We're not

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

discriminated against?

You tell us the date, the place,

2

and the circumstances.

Now, that's perfectly reasonable.

3

But it seems to me also perfectly reasonable to

4

say, moreover, we're not going to go and bother the

5

employer and make the employer go through all the process

6

of -- of answering the charge unless you're serious enough

7

about it that you've -- you've sworn to it under oath, as

8

the -- as the statute requires.

9

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, what happens as a

10

practical matter where verification occurs after the

11

filing date is that the employer is usually not required

12

to actually take any action.

13

QUESTION:

But here what -- the employer wasn't

14

even -- wasn't notified until the form -- on the EEOC's

15

proper form that did everything, including the

16

verification.

17

that -- that all that the imperfect charge did was stop

18

the clock, but the EEOC didn't give notice to the employer

19

at that point.

20

which the charge went to the employer.

21

it, the employer never got the form until it had been

22

perfected.

23

You seem to have treated both the same way,

That wasn't the charge -- the form in

MR. SCHNAPPER:

As I understand

Your Honor, it's our view that

24

the -- that the court -- that the EEOC erred in not

25

providing notice at that time, and it's -- I think it's

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

clear, from a reading of the compliance manual, that its

2

own manual did require notice at that time.

3

But in any event --

4

QUESTION:

And would also require notice of --

5

of a charge that was imperfect in other respects within 10

6

days of receiving the charge.

7

that it be in writing, for example, that's a requirement

8

that isn't -- isn't particularly in the -- in the statute

9

of limitations provision, but it's a requirement that it

10

So, if a -- the requirement

be in writing.

11

So, the commission gets a phone complaint from

12

somebody who says, my employer is discriminating against

13

me.

14

10 days contact the employer about that.

15

Now, you're saying that the commission should within

MR. SCHNAPPER:

The -- it's our view that --

16

that if the commission receives a sufficient charge, it

17

must do so.

18

phone call is a sufficient charge, and they specify how it

19

-- that would have to be put in writing --

20

The regulations do not contemplate that a

QUESTION:

This is all just a matter of the

21

regulations.

22

you know, this is sufficient or isn't.

23

could say that a phone call is sufficient.

24
25

I mean, the commission can -- can just say,

MR. SCHNAPPER:

This commission

The -- the statute requires that

a charge be filed, so I think it would have to be reduced

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to writing.

But I --

2

QUESTION:

The word filed.

3

MR. SCHNAPPER:

But I would say the commission

4

probably could alter its -- its regulation and deem a

5

memorialized phone call the filing of the charge.

6

-- those aren't the circumstances here.

7

That's

And -- and to get back to the specific issue

8

before the Court, the Fifth Circuit -- excuse me -- the

9

Fourth Circuit would have reached the same result in this

10

case regardless of whether this letter -- notice of this

11

letter or the letter itself had been served on the

12

employer within 10 days of the receipt of the letter on

13

November 14th.

14

Even if there had been service and notice, the court of

15

appeals would still have held the regulation was invalid.

16

And -- and it's the validity of that specific regulation

17

-- that's the only question that the court of appeals

18

addressed.

19

The decision below didn't rest on that.

QUESTION:

Mr. Schnapper, if you agree that if

20

-- you started out with Judge Luttig's position.

He

21

concurred and he raised four other.

22

this a charge?

23

the case have to go back so that the full court of appeals

24

could examine those questions on which Judge Luttig rested

25

so that he ended up concurring rather than dissenting?

Did the EEOC consider

We don't know whether it did.

Wouldn't

MR. SCHNAPPER:

QUESTION:

3

Yes.

Yes.

It remains --

So, you agree that those four

questions are alive and would have to be --

4

MR. SCHNAPPER:

It -- it remains open to the --

5

to the respondent to raise those issues on remand, and we

6

think that that's the appropriate procedure --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SCHNAPPER:

9

The -- as I was saying, specifically 706(e)(1)

10

and 706(b) establish separate and distinct requirements.

11

In the terms of Chevron, the question is whether those

12

provisions, read together, clearly require in an

13

unambiguous manner that verification happened before the

14

charge-filing deadline.

15

clarity certainly isn't present here.

16

our view is that the most plausible reading of the statute

17

is that verification could happen after the charge-filing

18

deadline.

19

of the statute because that is the common law rule.

20

That's the rule --

21

Thank you.
-- for addressing it.

We think that -- that such
To the contrary,

That's a particularly reasonable construction

QUESTION:

Do you think it's good practice for

22

the EEOC to wait until after the 300-day period and a

23

verification before it even notifies the employer?

24
25

MR. SCHNAPPER:

No.

No.

It was -- in our view,

it was improper to have done that here, that the -- the

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

statute doesn't authorize them to await verification.

2

is our understanding that is not their practice.

3

not authorized by the compliance manual.

4

manual does identify some circumstances in which there

5

might be delay in -- notification.

one of them.

statutory provision which says that the complaint shall be

and shall be presented to the agency within 100 days after

QUESTION:

-- that -- that go that far?

2

MR. SCHNAPPER:

The Federal rules require that a

3

notice of appeal shall be in writing and shall be filed

4

within a certain period of time.

5

Montgomery, the Court concluded that that didn't mean that

6

an unsigned -- that -- that where the only document that

7

was filed on time wasn't signed -- that there was no

8

timely notice of appeal.

9

And yet, in Becker v.

The -- the -- and -- and indeed, the common law

10

rule was where a statute said a complaint must be verified

11

and the complaint must be filed within a certain number of

12

-- of days or years, the -- the uniform Federal and State

13

interpretation of that was that the lack of verification

14

could be corrected after the expiration of the deadline.

15

It seems to us that the commission reasonably

16

concluded that Congress would have not wanted a more

17

stringent rule about relation-back of verification to

18

apply in the administrative process, a process ordinarily

19

initiated by laymen unassisted by counsel, than would

20

apply in civil litigation which is much more formal and

21

which -- and, you know, the -- the common law rule about

22

correcting verification after the fact applied regardless

23

of whether, as would normally be the case, the -- the

24

party involved was represented by counsel.

25

think the common law rule is a very important part of the

background of the statute.

2

QUESTION:

In these other situations that you

3

mentioned, does the court take action against a particular

4

individual or require a response from a particular

5

individual before the verification occurs?

6

-- that seems to me the difference here, that you're

7

saying the commission, within 10 days after receiving this

8

unverified complaint, has to submit it to the employer and

9

ask the employer to respond to it.

10

MR. SCHNAPPER:

No.

You see, that

The -- under the procedure

11

established by title VII, the employer is not required to

12

respond just by virtue of getting notice.

13

15

employer to do anything in response.

QUESTION:

It's not like a

I see.
It's simply a heads-up.

Now, does the agency require

20

verification to occur before it will demand a response

21

from the employer?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

22
23

I think that would be the normal

practice.

24

QUESTION:

Isn't that what -- the form --

QUESTION:

2

described the procedure?

3

it is -- that they send to the complainant says sign,

But I'm thinking -- if I didn't make it clear in

10

response to Justice Scalia's question, it's my

understanding that the normal practice of the agency would

be not to require the employer to do anything until a

defect in form, such as a lack of verification, had been

mean, this -- this could occur a very long time after the

event occurred --

MR. SCHNAPPER:

QUESTION:

I think --

-- so long as the commission waits

23

that long to get the verification.

24

MR. SCHNAPPER:

25

Right?

I think not in practice.

My

understanding is that in practice the commission will ask

If you had an employee who refused to verify

6

with reasonable promptness, I think the agency would

undoubtedly dismiss the -- the charge for lack of

8

cooperation, and that would be the end of it.

With the Court's leave, I'd like to reserve the

10

balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

14

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

15

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. BLATT:

16
17

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Under the longstanding rule at common law, the

18
19

failure to verify a complaint, as required by statute, may

20

be cured by an amendment that relates back to a timely

21

filed complaint.

22

regulation in 1966, 2 years after the passage of title

23

VII.

24

invalidate even the most detailed and well-pled complaint

25

that was timely filed with the commission but did not --

The commission incorporated that rule by

The contrary rule embraced by the panel would

was not verified until later.
The common law rule ensures that substantive

3

rights are not foreclosed when the essential elements of a

4

complaint are sufficient to vest the court with

5

jurisdiction.

6

QUESTION:

But -- but in this case, the -- the

7

agency doesn't treat it as a full charge until it's

8

verified for purposes of notifying the employer.

9

agency seems to be quite inconsistent.

10

MS. BLATT:

11

QUESTION:

The

Well, that's not -I mean, you -- you want us to accept

12

this argument as to what a charge is, but then you don't

13

want us to accept it for when the employer has to know

14

about it so the evidence doesn't go stale.

15

MS. BLATT:

It's not that the -- it's not that

16

the agency is waiting for verification before it gives

17

notice, and if the only thing missing from a charge is

18

verification, the agency's procedures require notice

19

within 10 days.

20

comes in like the November 14th letter that's not

21

verified, the procedures require notice within 10 days.

22

Thus, the -- if a November -- if a charge

That wasn't done here, Justice Kennedy.

The

23

agency did not comply with its obligation to provide the

24

employer with notice.

25

undermines the validity of the relation-back regulation

8

we're not going to give the employer notice until it's

10
11

I mean, it's reasonable to have it

But when you say

Evidence is getting stale and so forth.
MS. BLATT:

But, Justice Scalia, the -- the

12

agency's procedures required this employer to have notice,

13

whether or not the November 14th letter was verified, and

14

the employer then can preserve its documents or -- or

15

respond to the charge or do whatever it wants.

16

QUESTION:

The --

You say that that's a separate

17

mistake, and whatever prejudice that comes from that the

19

MS. BLATT:

Yes.

Is that it?

The issue of notice is what

20

drove one of the -- the key issues that drove Judge

21

Luttig's concurrence, which would have upheld the

22

regulation and the majority's interpretation.

23

24

employer, we'd still be here because the Fourth Circuit

25

would invalidate the charge because it wasn't verified

until day 313.

2

QUESTION:

But you agree with Mr. Schnapper that

3

the agency just missed, that they should have given -- for

4

the purpose of giving -- giving notice, sent that

5

unverified charge to the employer.

6

MS. BLATT:

Yes, absolutely.

It was filed with

7

the agency on receipt, and the -- an employer should have

8

been notified within 10 days.

9

later.

And that wasn't done until

And we think the -- this argument would be open on

10

remand, what the consequences of the -- of the untimely

11

notice.

12

But the untimely notice is a separate question

13

from an untimely filing of an otherwise sufficient and

14

valid charge, and this charge was filed within the 300-

15

day period because it was received by the agency on

16

November 14th.

17

elements of the charge are sufficient to -- to vest the

18

commission with jurisdiction, the verification could be

19

supplied later.

20

And our point is that if the essential

And the rule at common law, which was well

21

established in both State and Federal courts by 1964,

22

applied to lawyers in a formal pleading practice and

23

judicial proceedings, and the commission certainly acted

24

reasonably in adopting the same rule where Congress

25

anticipated that the charging parties are often

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

unrepresented by counsel.

2

We don't think anything in the text of title VII

3

forecloses the commission's regulation.

4

states that a charge must be verified, but it does not

5

state when verification must occur.

6

states that a charge must be filed within 300 days, but it

7

doesn't state that the charge must be verified at the time

8

it is filed.

9

QUESTION:

Section 706(b)

And section 706(e)

What about the argument that (b)

10

comes before (e), so -- and to define what a charge is,

11

the word charge, and then it's given a certain description

12

in (b).

13

same description.

14

Then when you get down to (e), it retains that

MS. BLATT:

Well, title VII didn't define the

15

word charge as a verified charge.

16

shall be verified, and certainly those don't -- it's just

17

the kind of ambiguity that would invoke the common law

18

rule that the charge -- a later -- a later verification

19

may relate back to the time of filing.

20

anything in this text comes close to trumping what -- what

21

would be the common law presumption.

22

It just said that it

So, we don't think

And as Judge Luttig observed, that there's not a

23

single provision either by its effect or its terms that

24

suggests that there's a limitations provision for

25

verification.

There's certainly one for filing and

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there's certainly a 10-day notice period for the employer,

2

but there's not a specific time period when the

3

verification must occur.

4

business, the agency will try to obtain a standard form

5

whose signature line contains an affirmation, and so the

6

verification requirement will be supplied.

7

not, the agency will dismiss that charge and cease its

investigation.

9

because the employee will not be able to pursue a claim

And in the normal course of

And if it's

And there's important consequences to that

10

for relief if he's not complied with the statutory

requirement of verification.

Can you tell me what happens -- it's

What happens if there's

The complaint is filed with the

Then the EEOC just sits on it and notifies

MS. BLATT:

Does the employer --

Or how does that work?

We know of just a handful of cases

21

where the charge just got lost in the system, and the

22

consequences of that would turn on two factors.

23

whether the employer could show prejudice in its ability

24

to defend the suit, and we think there's a second, a

25

constitutional question of whether the employee's rights

First,

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

own statutory obligations.

v. Zimmerman Brush would suggest that it cannot.

the employer didn't show prejudice.

This Court in Shell Oil also discussed that the

-- the courts of appeals had been uniform, that absent bad

faith by the agency or prejudice to the employer in

defending his ability to defend the suit, that the

employee's rights would not be prejudiced.

QUESTION:

13

Mr. Bell, we'll hear from you.

Thank you, Ms. Blatt.

14

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDER W. BELL

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BELL:

16

In the Mohasco case, this Court

17

taught that the EEOC may not adopt regulations that are

18

inconsistent with the statutory mandate.

19

on prior occasions, its interpretations of the statute

20

cannot supersede the language chosen by Congress.

21

that's exactly what's happened here.

As we have held

And

The statute in 706(b) says that charges shall be

22
23

in writing and under oath.

Next, it's separated by an

24

and.

25

charge shall include such information and be in such form

The statute goes on and says the statute -- the

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

as the EEOC requires.

2

What the EEOC has done here in its regulation is

3

to say that a charge is sufficient so long as it's in

4

writing.

5

text of the -- of the statute is simply inconsistent with

6

that.

7

That's exactly what the regulation says.

The

What the argument of the respondent is, is that

8

there's no real linkage between 706(b), the use of the

9

term 706(b), where the charge shall be in writing and

10

under oath, and 706(e), which specifies that charges shall

11

be filed within a certain time period.

12

so.

13

That's simply not

If you look at the text of 706(e), it says

14

charges under this section, not under this subsection.

15

says charges under this section shall be filed within a

16

certain period of time.

17

So, we're not dealing with two independent

18

statutes here.

19

exactly the same section of the same statute that are

20

joined at the hip.

21

It

We're dealing with two subsections of

QUESTION:

Judge -- Judge Luttig said that that

22

was a very plausible argument.

However, he said it was

23

not the only plausible reading of these two discrete

24

pieces of the same statute, and it was permissible for the

25

agency to take the view that it did.

To prevail here, you

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

have to show that the position that the agency took was

2

impermissible rather than as Judge Luttig said it is --

3

maybe it's not the best choice, but it was a permissible

4

reading of this less than crystalline statute.

5

MR. BELL:

Justice Ginsburg, we don't believe

6

that that is a permissible reading of the statute.

The

7

language just doesn't work that way.

8

Congress mentioned the term charge, which shall be in

9

writing and under oath, it gave definition to the term.

The first time

10

Justice Luttig -- Luttig simply didn't carry his analysis

11

far enough.

12

fact that 706(e) begins with charges under this section

13

shall be filed within a certain period of time.

14

simply no --

15

I don't think he mentioned, for example, the

QUESTION:

There's

It seems to me that the reading that

16

you are saying is the only proper reading is somewhat

17

inconsistent with this Court's position in Becker against

18

Montgomery last term.

19

MR. BELL:

Justice Ginsburg, we -- we don't

20

think so because we think what happened in Becker was a

21

harmonization of two rules of the Court, with a focus

22

particularly on rule 11, which -- in the same rule which

23

established the requirement of -- of the signing,

24

established the method to cure a failure to sign.

25

a very important difference here.

That's

In this statute,

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there's absolutely no indication of a -- of a intention on

2

the part of Congress to allow curing the one thing, the

3

oath and the signing, that they set apart from the

4

delegation to the agency of authority to control, which

5

was the form and content.

6

structure of the language, they -- they emphasized oath.

7

They applied it to commission charges, and they separated

8

it from the delegation of the authority to specify the

9

form and content.

I mean, just looking at the

In Becker, again the very thing that

10

established the requirement for signing established the

11

method of curing it.

12

QUESTION:

That's not true here.
I think we heard the argument from

13

Mr. Schnapper and Ms. Blatt that as a background common

14

law principle, the idea of a curative amendment to provide

15

a signature, to provide verification that then relates

16

back is nothing new.

17

be read in the light of that background understanding.

18

Yes, you must have a verification, but it can come later.

19

MR. BELL:

So that what Congress wrote has to

Your Honor, I -- I believe that the

20

background principle, if you will, the background legal

21

principle of our federalism and the background legal

22

principle of due process to employers in fairness to

23

employers in giving notice was probably more a part of the

24

applicable legal background here -- here than an --

25

QUESTION:

But that was conceded.

The -- the

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

commission should have sent the imperfect charge.

2

employer doesn't have to answer it till he gets the

3

perfected charge.

4

the EEOC had done what it was supposed to do, and now it

5

concedes that it should have sent that charge.

6

employer isn't bothered with having to respond until he

7

gets a perfected charge.

8
9

MR. BELL:

The

So, the function of notice is served if

And the

Well, Your Honor, the -- the

regulation here eliminates the filing deadline.

I mean,

10

there's no time specified when verification must occur,

11

and there are cases cited in amicus at page 18 of the

12

Equal Employment Advisory Council where charges have never

13

been verified.

I mean, there's just no deadline.

QUESTION:

14

But that's not what anybody is urging

15

here.

They concede that there must be a verification.

16

The question -- as there was in this case.

17

MR. BELL:

18

was never verified.

19

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, the letter itself
There was a form 5 that was verified.
No.

The proper -- like an amended

20

complaint.

21

to get in under the deadline, and then they file an

22

amended pleading which relates back.

23

You know that people file complaints in court

MR. BELL:

That's standard.

There's no indication that Congress

24

here adopted common law pleading rules.

In fact, the

25

legislative history makes it pretty clear that Congress

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

meant to circumscribe the right that they created in title

2

VII rather narrowly.

3

QUESTION:

Do you question, Mr. Bell, your

4

opponents' descriptions of the common law pleading

5

background that a complaint that was -- was required by

6

rule to be verified and filed not verified could be

7

verified later?

8
9

MR. BELL:
hold that.

There are certainly many cases that

There's no question about that.

10

But -- but here we're dealing with -- with

11

Congress creating a right that they struck a careful

12

balance in, and as this Court has said, Congress specified

13

certain procedures as a compromise and that the best

14

assurance of administrative fairness is to insist on the

15

procedures that Congress put out.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Bell, may I ask, going back to

17

Justice Scalia's questions earlier?

18

that the charges shall be in writing, under oath or

19

affirmation, and shall contain such information and be in

20

such form as the commission requires.

21

prove it, the date, place, and circumstances of the

22

practice and so forth.

23

The statute requires

And then later they

Supposing the -- a charge is filed that's kind

24

of a skeleton.

It has -- maybe it doesn't really describe

25

the place adequately, and the commission says to him, you

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

have not complied with the requirement giving enough

2

information.

3

be untimely in your view or would it be -- because it did

4

not contain all the information the commission required,

5

and literally the statute requires that.

6

We require an amendment.

MR. BELL:

Yes, Your Honor.

Would the charge

I don't think the

7

commission has the power to change the statute of

8

limitations.

9

QUESTION:

So that if they -- if they add a

10

requirement, more information after there's a filing, they

11

would also be deciding that the original charge was -- was

12

untimely.

13

MR. BELL:

Well, and in this case, Your Honor,

14

that's exactly what they did.

15

question that in this case the EEOC did not regard what

16

had been filed as a charge.

I mean, they -- there's no

17

QUESTION:

And -- and --

18

MR. BELL:

They kept writing letters to that

19

effect.

20

21

They kept telling the petitioner, you've got to

QUESTION:

You'd also have to say, Mr. Bell,

22

that -- that since the complaint or the charge has to be

23

under the statute in such form as the commission shall

24

prescribe, you'd also have to say that if -- if the charge

25

was filed on 9 by 12 paper and the -- and the commission

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

had prescribed 8 and a half by 12, that it's ineffective.

Right?

MR. BELL:

Yes, Your Honor.

5

I think that's what

I think --

Any little -- any little foot fault

MR. BELL:

Sorry.

MR. BELL:

I think that -- that --

MR. BELL:

If it was required by the commission,

I think that's what the statute says.

15

not dealing with a technical detail here.

16

QUESTION:

Of course, we're

Mr. Bell, wouldn't that be --

17

wouldn't that be totally inconsistent with what Congress

18

envisioned?

19

not going to be filed by lawyers, lawyers who have leeway

20

to amend under the Federal rules.

21

filed by lay people who didn't know anything, maybe not

22

even know what the word verification means, and yet you

23

think that Congress erected a structure where that initial

24

complaint had to be more meticulous than what the Federal

25

rules require a lawyer's pleading to say filed in court?

That is, these complaints with the EEOC were

These are going to be

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

That would be very odd.

2

MR. BELL:

The statute -- the statute seems to

3

indicate that with respect to the -- at least with respect

4

to the oath and writing requirements.

5

-- if -- if the EEOC can eliminate the oath requirement,

6

they'll be here next year perhaps eliminating the writing

7

requirement.

1

the two.

2

MR. BELL:

Well, we see a fundamental difference

between this Court harmonizing rules over which this Court

4

has control and the Court deciding whether to apply

5

requirements set out in a statute that Congress used to

6

create a certain right.

QUESTION:

You're not asserting that our reading

of our own rules is unreasonable, are you?

11

MR. BELL:

No, Your Honor.

12

QUESTION:

Well, but if our reading of our rules

13

isn't unreasonable and this agency has simply read the

14

statute the way we read our rules, then I assume that this

15

agency's reading of the statute is not unreasonable.

16

that's all that Chevron or whatever has replaced Chevron

17

requires.

It's inconsistent with

after the filing deadline, but a writing is not technical.
