ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILLIP C. HUGHEY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION

9
10

MR. HUGHEY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The adjudication of a Shipping Act complaint by

11
12

the Federal Maritime Commission is an administrative

13

regulatory process through which the agency makes findings

14

of fact and applies its interpretation of the Shipping Act

15

to those findings of fact.

16

executive power.
QUESTION:

17
18

This is an exercise of

Well, why isn't that adjudication, if

it applies the law to findings of fact?
MR. HUGHEY:

19

Mr. Chief Justice, it is

20

adjudication, but what we're suggesting is that it's not

21

judicial.

22

permits the agency to determine what position it would

23

like to take with respect to potential violations of the

24

Shipping Act.

25

It is an executive branch adjudication that

QUESTION:

But doesn't it involve a decision as

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to whether this particular respondent before the

2

commission has violated some provision of the act?

3

MR. HUGHEY:

Yes, and in that sense, Your Honor,

4

it is an exercise of ad hoc regulation.

5

on a specific and discrete set of facts.

6

QUESTION:

It's regulation

Well, you could say the same thing

7

about a court, that it's not making an -- making an ad hoc

8

regulation on these particular facts.

9

MR. HUGHEY:

However, Your Honor, in the case of

10

a court and a decision issued by a court, such an order

11

would be self-executing, whereas a Federal Maritime

12

Commission regulatory determination is not self-executing.

13

Rather, in the event that it's not voluntary compliance

14

with whatever order the agency reaches at the end of an

15

adjudication, the Attorney General or a private

16

complainant must go into a Federal district court and seek

17

to have that Federal district court compel compliance.

18

QUESTION:

Suppose Congress --

19

QUESTION:

Well, presumably a State would

20

feel -- would hesitate not to appear because it might

21

ultimately be enforced against the State by the Attorney

22

General, isn't that right?

23
24
25

MR. HUGHEY:

Yes, I think that is correct,

Justice O'Connor, that a State might -QUESTION:

Well, if the State is compelled to

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

participate, does that alter our analysis of it?
MR. HUGHEY:

No, I don't think so, because the

3

extent to which the State feels compelled by a potential

4

action by the Attorney General of the United States is

5

compulsion that arises from an action of the Federal

6

Government itself in the name of the United States.

7

QUESTION:

What if a -- is a private plaintiff

8

entitled to take a decision, or order, whatever you want

9

to call it, of the commission, and seek to have it

10
11

enforced by a court?
MR. HUGHEY:

Yes, Your Honor, under the Shipping

12

Act a private plaintiff is permitted to go into a Federal

13

district court --

14
15
16

QUESTION:

And would the Eleventh Amendment

defense raised by the State there prevail?
MR. HUGHEY:

I think that that case would

17

present a much more significant Eleventh Amendment issue.

18

The Shipping Act provides that the district court hearing

19

and, of course, an action brought by a private complainant

20

must have jurisdiction of the parties.

21

that to the extent there's any Eleventh Amendment interest

22

that requires vindication under the Shipping Act, that

23

vindication can be explored in the Federal district court

24

proceeding.

25

QUESTION:

I would suggest

Do you concede that at least as to

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reparation, where as I understand it the Government can go

2

into the district court to seek reparations, only the

3

private party, at least as to seeking dollars from the

4

State agency, that the Eleventh Amendment would preclude

5

that?

6

MR. HUGHEY:

Well, in its order in this case,

7

Justice Ginsburg, the commissioner finds that it would

8

like to see its reparation orders deemed to be enforceable

9

by a Federal district court, so I can't concede that they

10

wouldn't be, but what I can say is that determination is

11

not within the agency's jurisdiction.

12

determination for the Federal district court to make in

13

the event that the State instrumentality raised an

14

Eleventh Amendment immunity defense to the attempted

15

enforcement action by the private complainant.
QUESTION:

16

That would be a

Mr. Hughey, why do you assume that if

17

this is not judicial action, sovereign immunity doesn't

18

apply?

19

States retained upon the formation of the Federal

20

Constitution was the sovereign immunity that existed in

21

international law at the time.

I mean, I guess whatever sovereign immunity the

22

Can foreign sovereigns be summoned before

23

executive or legislative tribunals in this country?

24
25

MR. HUGHEY:

I don't know whether foreign

sovereigns can be summoned before the --

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Well, but the State sovereign

2

immunity is just what -- the sovereign immunity that they

3

had at international law.

4

Amendment is just a reflection of the fact that they

5

retained that sort of sovereign immunity, and I don't

6

think it makes any difference that, you know, if the King

7

of England summons George Washington, President of the

8

United States, to appear before a parliamentary commission

9

or some royal tribunal instead of an English court.

That's what -- the Eleventh

10

think George Washington would say, you know, go fly a

11

kite.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. HUGHEY:

Well, I think that one can turn to

14

the text of the Eleventh Amendment itself for some

15

guidance on this issue, Justice Scalia.
QUESTION:

16

I

No, you can't, because the Eleventh

17

Amendment is just -- we have held that it represents just

18

a reflection of the fact that the States retained that

19

sovereign immunity that they had before the formation of

20

the Federal Republic, and -MR. HUGHEY:

21

It's a reflection, Your Honor, of

22

the immunity from coercive judicial process.

I think

23

that's why the Eleventh Amendment begins that the judicial

24

power of the United States shall not be construed to

25

any --

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

That's the conclusion, but what

2

Justice Scalia's asking, and I think we're interested in,

3

is whether there's any precedent that you could cite, any

4

historical source that says that an administrative

5

tribunal can summon a sovereign before it and render a

6

judgment.

7

MR. HUGHEY:

Well, if I may suggest a different

8

side to that is that there is no precedent to suggest that

9

it can't.

It's been held by this Court in California v.

10

United States that State-run courts are subject to

11

commission regulation.
QUESTION:

12

Well, but if it's the dog that didn't

13

bark theory, it seems to me that cuts against you.

14

this has never been done, that's probably because it can't

15

be done.

17

At least we can make that inference.
MR. HUGHEY:

16

If

No, I think it has been done since

the Shipping Act was first passed, and it simply -QUESTION:

18

I'm not talking about the Shipping

19

Act.

20

that the Shipping Act is the precedent-breaking ground, it

21

seems to me that you're then on somewhat a slender

22

foundation for your argument here.

23

I'm talking about other authority.

MR. HUGHEY:

If you're saying

This Court held in California v.

24

United States that the Shipping Act as a regulatory

25

statute applies to all State-run courts.

What the

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

commission is suggesting, Justice Kennedy, is that that

2

applies equally with respect to agency adjudications.

3

QUESTION:

But California v. United States, the

4

United States was a party, so there was no Eleventh

5

Amendment question there.

6

MR. HUGHEY:

No, the question I think was

7

whether the entire statute, which at that time included a

8

regulatory procedure that could be initiated by private

9

complainants, whether the entire statute, which was a

10

coherent regulatory scheme, applied to State-run ports,

11

and that's what the Court held.

12

referred to the scheme for regulating waterfront

13

terminals, not the specific provision within that scheme

14

that permits the United States itself to initiate an

15

investigation.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

The Court specifically

But the case itself, United States v.

California, raised no Eleventh Amendment problem.
MR. HUGHEY:

No, that's correct.

That's

19

correct, it didn't raise an Eleventh Amendment problem,

20

but the issue was whether the regulatory scheme as a whole

21

could be applied to State instrumentalities, and this

22

adjudicatory proceeding under the Shipping Act is part of

23

that regulatory program.

24

With respect --

25

QUESTION:

Is there any -- I mean, it's sort of

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

an interesting question, but I wonder if there are laws or

2

rules which say that the Congress says that any ship,

3

including ships belonging to foreign States that enter New

4

York Harbor, will abide by the rules of the New York

5

Harbor Authority, and if they don't, you can -- there's

6

some argument about whether the pilot comes on or

7

something, that ship, including a military ship of a

8

foreign nation, or any other, has to adjudicate the

9

controversy in front of the New York Authority or other --

10

I don't know how that works, but maybe you do.

11

they are subject to our rules when they come here, and

12

bring their ships into the harbor.

13

MR. HUGHEY:

I imagine

Yes, I would think so, and the

14

commission does have some jurisdiction over foreign-

15

operated and -- foreign operated vessels that are owned by

16

sovereigns.

17

controlled carriers which are vessels that are owned by

18

Governments.

19

an entity, I see no reason why the commission would not

20

attempt to assert its regulatory adjudicatory jurisdiction

21

over such a complaint, but I know of no such specific case

22

under the statute.

23

The commission regulates sally-to-port

If a complaint were to be filed against such

QUESTION:

How do you get around the, sort of

24

the principle of dignity which has been emphasized in

25

every case, I think, since Seminole, and it's been given a

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

prominent place in the reasoning of the court majority in

2

those cases, that it's the dignity of the States, and so

3

on, which must be preserved.

4

If under the rule of sovereign immunity which

5

overarches the Eleventh Amendment there were indefeasible

6

dignity interests in the adjudication, say, in Seminole

7

and all of them, doesn't it follow, a fortiori, that there

8

are dignitary interests that would be offended by hauling

9

the State in front of an Article I, a purely

10

administrative tribunal?
MR. HUGHEY:

11

I think I would have two responses

12

to that, Justice Souter.

13

dignitary interest to be co-extensive with the sovereign

14

immunity interest, and second -QUESTION:

15
16

Well, that leaves the question in

a -- unanswered, I guess.
QUESTION:

17

First is that I understand the

The --

Justice Souter says the sovereign

18

immunity interest is co-extensive with the dignitary

19

interest.

20

(Laughter.)

21

QUESTION:

22
23

Let's assume the co-existence.

What's the answer to the question?
MR. HUGHEY:

Well, I think the answer would be,

24

then, that sovereign immunity doesn't apply, that a

25

State's dignity is not offended.

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

2

(Laughter.)

3

QUESTION:

I certainly agree with you.

Because dignity seems to have been

4

taken, in fact, as one of the interests to be served by

5

sovereign immunity.

6

immunity, why doesn't it apply if applied in those other

7

cases?

8
9

MR. HUGHEY:

Why doesn't the doctrine of sovereign

Well, I think that the dignity of

the State is less offended by this type of regulatory

10

adjudication, given the fact that the agency has no

11

coercive power to compel anything from the State.
QUESTION:

12

I -- it seems to me intuitively just

13

the opposite.

I mean, these are tribunals that -- if

14

we're going to talk about dignity, these are tribunals

15

that do not have the dignity of the judicial forums that

16

were at stake in the preceding cases, and I would have

17

supposed that the offense to the sovereignty of the State

18

was even greater to pull the State before these lesser

19

tribunals.
MR. HUGHEY:

20

Well, I think the offense to the

21

dignity interest of the State occurs when a State is

22

forced to do something which is the result of a coercive

23

act.

24
25

Under the Shipping Act -QUESTION:

Everything was fine in Seminole and

all of them, until we got to the point of judgment?

I

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

mean, is that the way you're trying to cut the argument?
MR. HUGHEY:

No.

I think in cases like Alden

3

and Seminole Tribe it was the threat of judgment that hung

4

over the United States that was the problem, because in

5

those cases, if the court entered an order against a State

6

it was automatically self-enforcing them.

7

QUESTION:

Well, they could have made them

8

appear and just said, you know, we understand that -- just

9

as you're saying, we understand that an order can't issue

10

against you, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't show up.

11

We haven't said that in sovereign immunity.

12

We've said the State does not have to appear.

13

hauling the State before the tribunal that is the offense,

14

not just the judgment.

15

MR. HUGHEY:

It is

Well, I think with respect to your

16

hypothetical this Court has found the power of coercion or

17

contempt is the judicial power necessary to the exercise

18

of all others, so I don't think that a court could just

19

tell a State, well, appear and we're not going to be able

20

to issue an order against you.

21

coercion can result from the judicial proceeding is the

22

point of the judicial proceeding and is what

23

differentiates it from this type of regulatory

24

adjudication.

25

QUESTION:

I think the fact that

Well, but the court can't say it, but

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Eleventh Amendment says it.

2

court can say, look, you know, by reason of your sovereign

3

immunity, we understand if you show up we can't issue any

4

contempt judgment, we can't issue a merits judgment

5

against you, but that doesn't mean you don't have to show

6

up.

7

it?

But it does mean you don't have to show up, doesn't

8
9

I mean, and whereupon the

MR. HUGHEY:

Well, yes, the State can move to

dismiss any suit that's filed against it in a court, but I

10

still think that it's the threat of coercive judgment

11

against the State that is the reason that the State can -QUESTION:

12

There is no threat of coercive

13

judgment.

14

you can't issue the coercive judgment, but the State still

15

doesn't have to show up.

16

The Eleventh Amendment makes it very clear that

MR. HUGHEY:

I don't think that analysis should

17

apply to this statute, Justice Scalia, because under the

18

Shipping Act the agency can -- cannot compel an appearance

19

by the State.

20

Shipping Act, the only way to do anything about that is to

21

go into a Federal district court and seek a court order,

22

and if the agency determines to do that, it then has to

23

ask the Attorney General to do so.

24

Attorney General may, rather than shall, enforce any order

25

the commission issued.

If the State just doesn't show up under the

Under the statute, the

That is therefore, by definition,

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

an exercise of the executive discretion that this Court

2

found acceptable in Alden v. Maine.

3
4

QUESTION:

Does the commission have contempt

powers?

5

MR. HUGHEY:

6

QUESTION:

No.

No, it does not.

Well, if it issues its process to a

7

State and the -- like the entity in the present case, and

8

the entity simply fails to show up, what can it do?

9

MR. HUGHEY:

If the entity failed to show up,

10

Mr. Chief Justice, the commission could issue an order

11

telling it to show up, but again, that would have to be

12

enforced by a Federal district court, and if --

13
14
15

QUESTION:

At the behest of the Attorney

General, or -MR. HUGHEY:

Yes.

Yes.

The commission would

16

have to ask the Attorney General to enforce it.

17

statute the Attorney General doesn't have to, but if he

18

determined to do so, he could then go into a district

19

court and try to enforce the order.

20

QUESTION:

Under the

And what would be the Eleventh

21

Amendment situation there, when the commission went into

22

district court to try to enforce its order to require

23

appearing?

24
25

MR. HUGHEY:

Oh, I would suggest that there

would be no Eleventh Amendment problem there, because the

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

enforcement action would be in the name of and by the

2

United States.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. HUGHEY:

It would be by the United States?
Yes.

It would be in the name of

5

and by the United States.

6

example, United States v. South Carolina State Ports

7

Authority.

8
9

QUESTION:

In this case, it would be, for

How many agencies have a pattern like

this, where they determine the rules by rule-making, this

10

kind of adjudication, and a commission-initiated

11

proceeding?

12

MR. HUGHEY:

I know that the Surface

13

Transportation Board, which used to be the NSA Commerce

14

Commission, has this authority, and I think that the

15

Federal Communication Commission does, but I'm not

16

entirely certain of that.

17

to uphold the State's claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity

18

in this case will have an adverse effect on the regulatory

19

scheme that the Congress has created in the Shipping Act

20

by undermining the notion of national uniformity in

21

maritime commercial regulations.

22

QUESTION:

I would suggest, if I may, that

Well, Congress could certainly handle

23

that by making it very clear by legislation that if the

24

State runs one of these operations, the State waives its

25

sovereign immunity.

Couldn't Congress make that clear?

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. HUGHEY:

I'm not sure if that kind of waiver

2

is still acceptable after this Court's opinions of recent

3

years.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. HUGHEY:

I would suggest that it's probably

6

not, but we think that, under the statute as it's written

7

now, there's no need for something like that, because it's

8

merely a regulatory action that the commission is

9

attempting to utilize to find facts to determine what

10

constitutes a Shipping Act violation, and again, there's

11

no use of coercive power.

12

coercion, the commission has to go into a Federal district

13

court.
If I could reserve the remainder of my time for

rebuttal.

Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

19

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

20

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER

21
22
23

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
States enjoy no sovereign immunity from Federal

24

executive branch action, even when it takes the form of

25

adjudication.

It is well-established that States have no

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

immunity from a suit brought by the Federal Government.

2

That's true not because of some preexisting notion of

3

sovereign immunity, but because that consent to suits by

4

the United States Federal Government is implicit in the

5

plan of the convention.

6

Now, proceedings before the Federal Maritime

7

Commission are a necessary predicate for the United States

8

Government to bring a Federal suit to enforce the Shipping

Act.

Given that the States enjoy no immunity from such a

10

suit, they should not be allowed to reach back into the

11

administrative process and assert an immunity from the

12

preliminary proceedings before the agency.
QUESTION:

13

But I'm not -- I don't understand the

14

argument.

Sovereign immunity is based on parties, and we

15

have said that when the United States is a party, there's

16

no sovereign immunity, and not, incidentally, because that

17

was inconsistent with some earlier notion of sovereign

18

immunity, because the Constitution changed it.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

20

QUESTION:

21

No --

But here we have a private party.

That's all -- isn't that all the difference in the world?
MR. CLEMENT:

22

But we have a private party that's

23

not initiating a lawsuit, but is initiating executive

24

action.

25

Federal Government and say a State government is violating

Federal law.

protects the individual petitioner's right to petition the

3

Federal Government and complain about that violation.

4

In fact, the Petition Clause rightly

Now, I don't think it violates the Constitution

5

for the United States Federal Government to say, we take

6

citizen complaints seriously, and we're going to

7

investigate each and every one of them, and I wouldn't

8

think that it would violate the Eleventh Amendment for the

9

Attorney General to give the party who's the subject of

10

the complaint, even if it's the State, an opportunity to

11

come before --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. CLEMENT:

14
15

Yes, but --- the executive branch and

explain why there wasn't a violation.
QUESTION:

But the commission isn't just like

16

kind of an ombudsman here.

17

procedures that greatly resemble adjudication.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

I mean, it's got very definite

Well, they do resemble

19

adjudication, and that's part of the process to formalize

20

and regularize this process of getting complaints from

21

citizens and response from others, but I don't think the

22

formalization and regularization of that process turns it

23

into a judicial act.

24
25

QUESTION:

It remains an act -Well, isn't it the case that if the

State defaults and says, you have no jurisdiction over me,

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and the commission therefore comes to a conclusion --

2

we'll leave the word adjudication out of it.

3

a conclusion.

4

such, at the behest of the National Government, in a

5

district court, isn't it?

6

It comes to

That conclusion itself is enforceable as

9

Shipping Act that's contrary to the view of the Federal

If there's a case where the State doesn't

Maritime Commission, then there will be no order.
QUESTION:

11

Let's assume it's not contrary.

12

Let's assume the Maritime Commission says, you, private

13

party, are right, and we hold that the State has committed

14

the following violations, and I presume should be enjoined

15

from further commission, whatever order it might come up

16

with.

17

Once the commission has come to such a

18

conclusion, isn't that conclusion, as such, enforceable at

19

the behest of the United States in the district court?

20
21
22

MR. CLEMENT:

It is -- it would be enforceable

through a judicial procedure under the Shipping Act.
QUESTION:

So -- if that is so, there's

23

something much more involved here than merely an agency of

24

the National Government taking a complaint seriously and

25

investigating it, and the difference is that in the --

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

under the act, its conclusion on the investigation becomes

2

an enforceable order at the behest of the National

3

Government in a district court, and isn't that the

4

difference?

5

MR. CLEMENT:

But I don't think it's a critical

6

difference, because the reason that that becomes

7

enforceable, subject to whatever defenses there are, the

8

reason that becomes enforceable is not because it's the

9

midway point in some litigation.

It's enforceable because

10

it reflects the executive branch's definitive

11

interpretation of the Shipping Act.

12

The cease-and-desist order --

13

QUESTION:

Well, the Federal Government could

14

have an interpretation of the Shipping Act and go into

15

it -- assuming there is otherwise a statutory jurisdiction

16

here, the National Government could have a view of the

17

shipping Act and go into the district court and say, this

18

is our considered view, and the other party would have an

19

opportunity to oppose it.

We'd have a lawsuit.

20

As things stand now, when the United States goes

21

in with what you call its considered view, that is the end

22

of the issue on the merits, as I understand it.

23

thing the district court is there for is to enforce it.

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

The only

Well, there are some challenges

that can be brought to that, and I guess the problem with

Could they have a trial de novo on

MR. CLEMENT:

No, they can't, under the current

system.

6

QUESTION:

Could they collaterally attack and

7

say, look, it doesn't mean anything to us, because we

8

can't be hauled in front of the commission by a private

9

party.

10
11

Can it -- is such a plea recognized?
MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think it currently is, but

if that's -QUESTION:

12

No, I don't think it is, either, and

13

that's why your argument that this is nothing but a way

14

for the National Government to take a considered view of a

15

complaint and come to a conclusion seems to me beside the

16

point.

17

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, it -- but the point, I

18

think -- first of all, if the problem is the level of

19

review that's given at the end of the process, then that's

20

what should be adjusted, not throwing out the entire

21

proceeding ab initio as the Fourth Circuit did.

22

But more to the point, I think the reason

23

there's deference is because it reflects the executive

24

branch's view, and it's the same in that order whether

25

it's the product of a privately initiated complaint and

22
Alderson Reporting Company

2

complaint.

pressure for the State-regulated entity to participate in

the proceeding, but neither should they get an immunity.

In both cases there's going to be practical

The practical pressure is not the same as the

Well, Mr. Clement, when I began to

read your brief and I sensed that the sky was falling, and

12

so I was turning my pages to see all of the horrible

13

things that were going to happen to the Federal scheme if

14

the court of appeals judgment stood, and I didn't see much

there.

16

17

before them all the time and say, well now, Governor,

18

you're not enforcing the Federal laws?

19

as part of our constitutional tradition.

20

we would create a great revolution in traditional practice

21

by pulling the Ninth Circuit.

22

There's the Vending Stand Act in one of the

many State-run entities that are regulated, but the

2

executive branch has the flexibility to regulate them

3

through rule-making, through agency-initiated

4

adjudications, or through private adjudications.

5

In each one of those, there are practical

6

pressures to participate.

In each one of those, the rule-

7

making can be initiated by a private complaint.

specific provision in the commission's regulation to allow

9

rule-makings to be kicked off by a private complaint, but

There's a

10

that doesn't turn it into something other than the

11

executive branch's determination of what the law is and

12

how it should be enforced, and this Court has generally

deferred to the executive branch's need to determine how

14

best to take care that the laws are faithfully executed.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

hasn't the labor board been involved in adjudicating

complaints about the State university as an employer in

respect to the labor unions?

MR. CLEMENT:

QUESTION:

6
7

Well --

Maybe it hasn't.

I wouldn't know why

it wouldn't have.
MR. CLEMENT:

I mean, but one thing that's

8

certainly clear about the labor board is that that's a

9

perfect example of an administrative agency that decides

10
11
12
13

to proceed by adjudication.
QUESTION:

I'm not arguing with you.

I'm just

wondering why there were not more examples.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, another example is the

14

Railway Labor Act, because the Railway Labor Act is --

15

defines its jurisdiction coextensively with the Interstate

16

Commerce Commission.

17

the Railway Labor Act.

18

disputes are initiated by a private party.

Interestingly, in footnote 16 of that opinion,

22

the Court reserved the question of whether the Eleventh

Amendment provided protection for the suit in court, but

24

it didn't say anything about Eleventh Amendment protection

25

before the board itself, and I think the relevant history

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

here is almost exactly the opposite of the case in Alden.

2

In Alden, this case had a long history of State

3

sovereign immunity, and very few and only recent efforts

4

by the Federal Government to abrogate that immunity.

5

Here, by contrast, there's a 115-year tradition of State

6

entities being subject to regulatory commissions, and very

7

few and only recent efforts to invoke any kind of Eleventh

8

Amendment immunity before them.

Amendment has a special relevance here that it lacked in

Here, the recognition that the commission

18

United States necessarily means it exercises the executive

19

power of the United States, and this Court has

traditionally held that the executive branch may initiate

bar.

23

The fact that this proceeding --

with sovereign immunity.

4

We're not concerned about the textual

MR. CLEMENT:

We're concerned

But in this particular context, I

5

think the text is relevant, because this is not a free-

6

floating, pre-existing notion of sovereign immunity.

7

we're saying is that the Eleventh Amendment waiver in the

plan of the Constitution that allows the United States

Government to sue a State also allows it to take the

preliminary steps in the administrative process.

MR. DEAN:

This case presents the question of whether

sovereign immunity protects a State from a private suit

QUESTION:

Now, they can be

Well, is that statutory liability, is

that enforceable by the commission without court order, or
did it have to go to court to do it?
MR. DEAN:

Ultimately, if push comes to shove

12

and there's a confrontation, they have to go to court, but

13

Mr. Chief Justice, I think anybody faced with a statutory

14

liability of the United States imposed by Federal law

15

considers that a sanction, and we do not have the

16

opportunity to protect our interests, to say, no, no, no,

17

this wasn't a violation, this is what we did, when the

18

agency, the only standard for the enforcement of the

19

agency's order in court is whether or not it was duly and

regularly issued.

21

So the position of the United States that this

is not a -- that this is a proceeding that is essentially

equivalent to a petition by a private party for executive

25

exercise of the judicial power in a comprehensive

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

proceeding can be delegated to nonjudicial officers,

2

provided it is subject to judicial supervision and subject

3

to some specific supervisory parameters that exist in this

4

case, but it's a complicated question, and the Court has

5

disagreed on it, and various court have disagreed on this

6

question for sometime, and in fact, in some of the cases

7

that I just mentioned, the United States Supreme Court

8

took appellate jurisdiction from an Article I tribunal in

9

the executive branch, and under those circumstances

10
11

something was going on before the court of claims.
QUESTION:

You know, now that I can quote one of

12

my favorite authors, Justice Scalia, he says it is no

13

doubt true that all such administrative bodies adjudicate,

14

they determine facts, apply a rule of law to those facts,

15

and thus arrive at a decision --

16

MR. DEAN:

Well --

17

QUESTION:

-- but there is nothing inherently

18

judicial about adjudication.

19

MR. DEAN:

Granted, but --

20

QUESTION:

Then what is it that makes it the

21
22

judicial power?
MR. DEAN:

What is it that makes it subject to

23

sovereign immunity, or what is it that makes it the

24

judicial power?

25

QUESTION:

The judicial power is what we're

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

all -- and I'm --

2

MR. DEAN:

Well, the judicial power, if you look

3

at a proceeding, an administrative proceeding like the

4

Shipping Act, and this Court held that, held this in the

5

Far East Conference case, it said, you can't take one

6

isolated aspect of it.

7

which is the Federal Maritime Commission and consider its

8

functions independent of the rest of the proceeding that

9

is involved.

10

You cannot take the organic entity

Ultimately, this proceeding ultimately, in

11

combination with the courts of the United States, this

12

proceeding invokes the judicial power, whether the FMC is

13

acting --

14

QUESTION:

All executive action does.

15

that's just too broad a principle.

16

since we don't have a

17

a Habeas Corpus Clause.

18

do to you that can't be challenged in court.

I mean,

I mean, the fact is,

-- we have a Constitution that has
There's nothing the executive can

19

MR. DEAN:

Well, this is --

20

QUESTION:

Ultimately, the court is the moment

21

of truth, but that doesn't convert every executive action

22

into an exercise of the judicial power.

23

MR. DEAN:

I know, but this is clearly not

24

purely executive action.

This is an independent agency,

25

and this Court has held repeatedly that officers that

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

exercise quasi-judicial power can be subject to special

2

removal requirements, and that is --

3
4

QUESTION:

Ah, so if this wasn't an independent

agency, it would be different?

5

MR. DEAN:

No, but let me -- both in Hensel and

6

in Artistani, and in this Court's decision in West v.

7

Gibson --

8
9
10

QUESTION:
you?

Would you -- may I just interrupt

What if this were an executive agency, rather than

an independent agency?
MR. DEAN:

11

Could you make the same argument?

Like -- the claims court was within

12

the Department of Treasury at the time these decisions

13

were handed down.

14

matter, but it does instruct the Court's analysis that

15

this is a quasi-judicial independent agency --

16
17

QUESTION:

Well, but that's not answering my

MR. DEAN:

-- and its officers are not subject

question.

18
19

That doesn't necessarily resolve the

to executive supervision.
QUESTION:

20

What is your answer to my question?

21

If it were a pure executive agency, would it be the same

22

case for you?
MR. DEAN:

23

No.

It would be the same case

24

depending on the statutory process involved, Justice

25

Stevens.

The agencies --

1

QUESTION:

In the statuary process, but clearly

2

an executive agency within the Department of Commerce or

3

Department of Agriculture, or something like that.

4

MR. DEAN:

It was -- the court of claims was in

5

the Department of Treasury at the time, and customs

6

officials have done --

7

QUESTION:

You're a little too fast for me.

8

MR. DEAN:

I'm sorry.

9

QUESTION:

What is your answer?

10

Is it the same

case entirely within the executive branch?

11

MR. DEAN:

It is.

12

QUESTION:

Okay.

13

QUESTION:

Let me ask you a slightly different

14

question.

If we assume for the sake of argument that it

15

is not the judicial power that's being exercised here, do

16

you lose?

17

MR. DEAN:

No.

18

QUESTION:

Why don't you lose?

MR. DEAN:

The court below said it was

19
20
21

Why don't you l

lose?

irrelevant.

22

QUESTION:

Pardon me?

23

MR. DEAN:

The court below said it was

24
25

irrelevant, and I agree with that proposition.
QUESTION:

And it's irrelevant because?

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. DEAN:

Because sovereign immunity --

2

QUESTION:

Sovereign immunity -- in other words,

3

you've got a sovereign immunity argument which is at least

4

distinct from the Eleventh Amendment argument?

5

MR. DEAN:

Absolutely.

6

QUESTION:

Okay.

7

MR. DEAN:

And the United States has a sovereign

8

immunity argument, and they apply sovereign immunity --

9

QUESTION:

That's what I thought.

10

MR. DEAN:

The United States applies its

11

sovereign immunity in proceedings just like this.

It has

12

for all time.

13

sovereign immunity applies to the United States in

14

administrative proceedings consistently for the last 130

15

years, and there has not been one single dissent from that

16

proposition that I've been able to find.

As a matter of fact, this Court has held

17

In West, all the Justices of this Court assumed

18

for the purposes of that analysis that sovereign immunity

19

principles apply before the EEOC.

20

QUESTION:

Well, but sovereign immunity for the

21

United States may not be co-extensive with sovereign

22

immunity for the States.

23

to the States goes beyond just the literal language of the

24

Eleventh Amendment about the judicial power.

25

MR. DEAN:

Granted that sovereign immunity

Mr. Chief Justice, I agree with that

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

proposition in the abstract, but in this particular case,

2

I think there's a lot of similarity, and I'll give you

3

exactly -- I'll tell you exactly why I think why.

4

Firstly, the courts have held that it's a

5

reciprocal -- this Court has held over the years that it

6

is a reciprocal privilege, but the United States in its

7

brief in this case --

8
9
10

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

What do you mean by that,

that it's a reciprocal privilege?
MR. DEAN:

Well, in Alden and in Hans and -- the

11

Court has held that the privilege of Federal sovereign

12

immunity -- State sovereign immunity is a reciprocal

13

privilege to the privilege enjoyed by the States.

14
15
16
17
18

QUESTION:

By reciprocal you mean that it's co­

extensive?
MR. DEAN:

Co-extensive mirror image, yes,

Justice Scalia.
The United States has suggested in this case,

19

and it's a proposition that I agree with, that the

20

sovereign immunity of the United States at least as it

21

applies to money judgments -- and it's much broader than

22

money judgments, but let's just talk about money judgments

23

for a minute, that at least as it applies to money

24

judgments is informed by the Appropriations Clause, which

25

reserves to the legislature, to the Congress the right to

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

spend, and we all know the right to spend is the right to

2

tax.

3

So our body politic, our -- the public -- the

4

people of the United States have made a determination that

5

their Constitution, which is their sovereign, commits to

6

the legislative branches the exclusive right to expend the

7

public's money, and that's a very fundamental principle in

8

our Federal Constitution.

9

reflected word for word in this constitution of South

10

That principle is also

Carolina -QUESTION:

Well, you don't think the States

13

MR. DEAN:

Pardon me?

14

QUESTION:

-- the exclusive right to determine

11
12

have --

15

when their money will be spent in a proceeding brought by

16

the United States, do you?

17

MR. DEAN:

Excuse me?

18

QUESTION:

You don't say that the States have

19

the same power over their own money that the United States

20

has over its money, in an action brought by the United

21

States?

22

MR. DEAN:

I do.

23

QUESTION:

There's sovereign immunity -- even in

24
25

an action brought by the United States?
MR. DEAN:

No, this Court has held that they

1

3
4

have consented to suit, so it doesn't apply in that area.
QUESTION:

So they don't have sovereign immunity

in cases brought by the United States.
MR. DEAN:

That's correct, but in this

5

constitution of the State of South Carolina that was

6

adopted 9 years before this Constitution was adopted,

7

there is the same Appropriations Clause.

8

principle is reflected, that no moneys may be obligated --

9
10

12
13

QUESTION:

The same

But that was before the Supremacy

Clause was adopted in the Federal Constitution.
MR. DEAN:

But this is a constitutional

principle Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

It is a question --

It is not a constitutional

14

protection -- principle that protects the States from

15

liability to the United States.

16
17

MR. DEAN:
hypothetical.

I ask you this question as a

The Constitution of this --

18

QUESTION:

No, counsel doesn't ask questions.

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. DEAN:

21

The constitution of -- I'll state it in a

I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.

22

declaration.

The constitution of the State of South

23

Carolina reflects the same principle reflected in the

24

Appropriations Clause.

25

both of them organized on the same fundamental principle

We have two sister sovereigns,

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that only the people have the right to levy on the public

2

treasury, and only the people through their elected

3

representatives, and only the people have the right to

4

spend, and therefore only the people have the right to

5

tax.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Dean --

7

MR. DEAN:

Now, you have these two comparable

8

constitutions.

9

that principle?

How do you put them together and violate

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Dean --

11

MR. DEAN:

I don't know the answer to that

12
13

question, Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

-- you recognized a case called Ex

14

parte Young, and let's say that the private complainant

15

says, okay, I'm not going to sue the State court

16

authorities.

17

as the FMC to please substitute for the entity the

18

individual commissioners, and they said go ahead, and they

19

don't have sovereign -- individuals, at least with respect

20

to prospective relief do not have sovereign immunity.

21
22
23

I'm going to sue the commissioners, and so

Why couldn't -- is that then just a matter of
amending a complaint to name different parties?
MR. DEAN:

That suit belongs in Federal court,

24

and I doubt very seriously that the commission has that

25

statutory jurisdiction.

The reason is that it has

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

jurisdiction over persons engaged in the business of

2

operating, or internal operators.

3

that any individual employee would satisfy that test, but

4

the test certainly exists under Ex parte Young.

5

I very sincerely doubt

The opportunity might exist, except for the fact

6

that the proper way for the individual to proceed in this

7

particular case would be to file a declaratory judgment

8

under State law, which is available, to obtain the relief

9

the individual requested.

10
11

QUESTION:

But you haven't answered the

question --

12

MR. DEAN:

I'm sorry, Justice --

13

QUESTION:

-- why couldn't the FMC say --

14

MR. DEAN:

I don't believe the Shipping Act

15

gives the FMC jurisdiction over individuals who are

16

employees of entities that are engaged in --

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Not employees, the commissioners

themselves, the members of the State body.
MR. DEAN:

The officers of the -- I don't

20

believe the Shipping Act gives the FMC jurisdiction over

21

officers of entities that it regulates.

22

it has that kind of personal jurisdiction, Your Honor.

23

That issue has not -- I am not aware that that issue has

24

decided, but I frankly have grave doubts that it would.

25

QUESTION:

I don't believe

But if that matter were clarified so

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that Congress, wanting the FMC to have this third way of

2

regulating said, in the case where State agencies are

3

involved you can sue the individuals, individuals who

4

compose the entity --

5

MR. DEAN:

Well, the proper way for the Federal

6

Maritime -- as I said, I don't think the FMC has that

7

jurisdiction.

8

has to do is initiate its own complaint.

Circuit.

Instead, they reversed the

The parties in this, the Federal parties in this

17

case do not challenge the holdings of this case in

18

Nichols, Hans, Sherwood, Alden, or Seminole, so in effect

19

what they're asking this Court to decide is the following

20

three propositions, and all of the following three

21

propositions:

22

Article I have powers that both State and Federal courts

23

lack, even though they constitutionally may adjudicate

24

only subject to the supervision of the latter; 2) that

25

Congress, merely by assigning a private cause of action to

that lesser tribunals established under

1

administrative tribunal, acquires and exercises power it

2

does not otherwise have to abrogate State sovereign

3

immunity, thereby bypassing this Court's sovereign

4

immunity jurisprudence, and 3) that States lack the

5

reciprocal right to assert sovereign immunity in Federal

6

fora where the immunity of the United States clearly

7

applies.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION:

Well, you really don't need your

third argument, do you, that the State sovereign immunity
is co-extensive with Federal sovereign immunity?
MR. DEAN:

I don't need that third argument, Mr.

12

Chief Justice, that's quite correct, but what the United

13

States asserts, says about administrative proceedings, if

14

they were purely executive action -- for example, if it

15

was purely an executive branch matter, this -- the United

16

States has come into this Court on numerous occasions most

17

recently in Artistani and West, and asked this Court to

18

intervene in what they now say is a purely executive

19

branch matter.

20

There was no inquiry.

There was no special

21

analysis that the court did to determine whether or not

22

the intervention in that kind of purely executive branch

23

matter was warranted.

24

The court assumed that the doctrine of sovereign immunity

25

as it applied to the Federal Government applied to it, and

There was no discussion of that.

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

I might add that --

2

QUESTION:

Oh, what is the boundary?

Apparently

3

you're now talking about a principle of state sovereign

4

immunity outside the scope of Amendment 11 of the United

5

States Constitution, and I haven't really heard of that

6

one.

7

to discover what its bounds are, to discover what the

8

implications are, to discover if it applies when the

9

President does anything?

I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but where do I go

I mean, I don't know what the

10

scope of that one is, so where do I go to find out about

11

that?

No, I'm just asking -- my question

MR. DEAN:

Hans -- Hans v. Louisiana is the only

is --

place you need to go.
QUESTION:

In other words, Hans you say is

outside the scope of the Eleventh Amendment.
MR. DEAN:

By its terms it held it was outside

the scope of the Eleventh Amendment.
QUESTION:

All right, so Hans does not have to

do with the Eleventh Amendment.
MR. DEAN:

It does not by its terms have

anything to do --

1

QUESTION:

Okay, it does not.

2

MR. DEAN:

-- it reflects the --

3

QUESTION:

Then how do I discover the scope of

4

this principle of State sovereign immunity outside the

5

Eleventh Amendment?

6

MR. DEAN:

Well, the same way you discover the

7

principle of Federal sovereign immunity.

You look at what

8

the nature of the proceeding, and the nature of the

9

affront to the dignity of the sovereign is being involved,

10

you identify what the sovereign's interests are, and in

11

this particular case, in the money judgment it violates

12

the same clause of our constitution that it violates in

13

the case of the Federal Constitution, and that's pretty

14

persuasive.

15

QUESTION:

But as I understand your argument,

16

it's not limited to the reparations part of the case.

17

There's --

18

MR. DEAN:

No.

19

QUESTION:

-- also a request for a cease and

20
21
22

24
25

desist order.
MR. DEAN:

Although I might add, Justice

Stevens -QUESTION:

You don't really need the reparations

for your position.
MR. DEAN:

-- that the pure participation in

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this lengthy proceeding has had consequences for the

2

Treasury of the State of South Carolina, but nonetheless,

3

it's much broader than that, yes, Your Honor.

4

the nature -- as this Court held in Seminole, and I might

5

add, when I was -- when we argued the case before the

6

Fourth Circuit we had a little discussion about whether or

7

not the State of South Carolina was willing to be a

8

scofflaw.

9

It goes to

In other words, whether we were willing to have

10

our -- to have allegations, whether they be frivolous or

11

serious, against us go unanswered in an administrative

12

tribunal that concededly regulates us in Washington and

13

have as the United States maintains this become a

14

precedent that would affect their dealing with us in the

15

future without defending ourselves, and that's simply not

16

a realistic option for the State of South Carolina.

17

It's not a realistic option for anyone, much

18

less a sovereign.

If there's anything to dignity, there's

19

a dignity to that, to be able to defend yourself against

20

allegations and not have people who are decisionmakers

21

make judgments against you --

22

QUESTION:

But let me just --

23

MR. DEAN:

-- based on unanswered allegations,

24

or unanswerable allegations.

25

QUESTION:

May I interrupt you for just a

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

moment, please?

2

MR. DEAN:

Justice Stevens.

3

QUESTION:

Let's put the reparations to one

4

side, and let's assume you're dead right on the monetary

5

aspect of the case.

6

in everyone's best interest to have proceedings like this

7

initiated ex parte, and then the agency makes up its mind

8

whether to go -- bring an enforcement proceeding, or it

9

would be better to have a formal proceeding where you

10

have a chance to respond to the charges and so forth?
MR. DEAN:

11

Is it your position that it would be

No, it's far better, Justice Stevens,

12

to have a person come to the agency, present its concerns

13

to the agency, and the agency approach the State of South

14

Carolina, one sovereign to another sovereign.
This case involves the regulation of gaming

15
16

ships.

The Congress has committed that to our discretion

17

under State law.

18

Act, which gave us the right to regulate gaming ships,

19

does not say that it's subject to review by the Federal

20

Maritime Commission.

21

the Federal Maritime Commission --

We are given that right.

The Johnson

It does not say, for example that

Congress.

50
Alderson Reporting Company

1

which the agency thinks there's a colorable basis for a

2

proceeding, do you think the only way they can proceed

3

against you formally is to first of all get all the

4

information ex parte from the private parties, and then

5

make up their own mind as to whether to bring a formal

6

proceeding in the name of the agency?

7

MR. DEAN:

Just like the Department of Justice

8

does when it enforces the laws against the States, yes,

9

Your Honor, that is the proper way of doing it, because we

10

can and will address those allegations at that time, but I

11

can assure you that the -- this case implements policies

12

of the State of South Carolina that are important to it,

13

the regulation of gaming ships, the Johnson Act Congress

14

has said it's up to the State of South Carolina to make

15

those policies and to implement those policies --

16

QUESTION:

Well, but the Johnson Act certainly

17

didn't say that South Carolina was exempt from the

18

requirement of the Shipping Act, that it not discriminate.

19

MR. DEAN:

No, but I can -- that's correct, but

20

in -- any regulatory system has at its core the right to

21

make discretionary, discriminatory judgments about what

22

does and does not comply with the policies of that regime.

State law as authorized by the Johnson Act.
QUESTION:

Well, certainly you're not suggesting

3

that the Shipping Act in its prohibition against

4

discrimination can't be applied to South Carolina other

5

than on a sovereign immunity basis, are you?

6

MR. DEAN:

No, we're not, but what we're saying

7

is that if they exercise the executive discretion that

8

they ought to act, that the Constitution envisions them

9

enacting, that they would approach us as a sovereign, we'd

10

say, these are our sovereign interests, they'd say, they

11

are their sovereign interests --

12

QUESTION:

Well, yes, but --

13

MR. DEAN:

-- ultimately they would trump ours,

14
15

if there was a disagreement -QUESTION:

Yes.

In 1787 we adopted a

16

Constitution so they didn't have to approach one another

17

as sovereign to sovereign any more.

18

MR. DEAN:

That's true, but in this particular

19

area the Congress has decided that the sovereign State of

20

South Carolina gets to do the regulating, Mr. Chief

21

Justice, so we would come down and we would have two

22

different regulatory regimes, and we would approach each

23

other, and we would resolve the differences between them,

24

and if they disagreed, if ultimately they disagree, they

25

could bring a complaint against us, which they have the

right to do, and we would defend it, and we would

participate.

3

ourselves, and we would defend ourselves, and so that's --

4

We would have the opportunity to defend

QUESTION:

It would not be, perhaps, as

5

intellectually satisfying as resolving the case

6

specifically on the merits.

7

there's no clear statement that waives sovereign immunity,

as we did in Vermont Yankee?

Yes, Your Honor.

But there's no clear statement by the

Congress of the United States intending abrogate -MR. DEAN:

Oh, no, clearly not.

There's no

mention in the Shipping Act at all of intention to waive

22

inconceivable that it might do so at some point, but it is

clearly -- it is clearly no waiver of sovereign immunity,

even if -- even going back to the law where it said the

25

Congress could waive the sovereign immunity of the United

States, of the States, I'm sorry, there is no evidence of

2

any intent whatsoever in the Shipping Act to do that.

3

The fact that the Federal Maritime Commission

4

may bring its own actions against the United States --

5

against the States as it did in the California case proves

6

the opposite proposition, that the Congress, that was the

7

proper way to proceed, and I think that is the proper way

8

to proceed.

9

The -- I'd like to go back to -- this complaint

10

is a verified private complaint.

It is -- calls for

11

reparations in the broadest form of reparations, including

12

consequential damages, interest and attorney's fees, the

13

commission has no discretion in the handling of this

14

complaint, it's required by law to adjudicate it, and the

15

agency's findings become final subject only to judicial

16

review.
This is precisely the kind of anomalous

1

MR. DEAN:

Yes, but they held that the Court

2

was -- they held the State immune from the proceeding.

3

Obviously, the proceeding had already been completed, but

4

I think it's fairly clear now that the dignity of the

5

sovereign entails to the entire proceeding, applies to the

6

entire proceeding, but you know, this question about the

7

dignity of the sovereign, the Court in Hans gave us some

8

instructions, some future instructions --

9

QUESTION:

But Hans was a court case.

10

MR. DEAN:

Hans is a court case.

11

QUESTION:

Well, I mean, it's not a case, then,

12
13
14
15

in which they say it's not the judicial power -MR. DEAN:

Just like Federal sovereign immunity

is a court case.
QUESTION:

And why is it a case in which they

16

say -- isn't it -- I mean, I'm back on my judicial --

17

forget it, I'm sorry.

18

MR. DEAN:

My time is up.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PHILLIP C. HUGHEY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION
MR. HUGHEY:

If I could keep going with your

1

inquiry, Justice Breyer, I think we are suggesting that

2

there is a line in this case, and that line is Freytag v.

3

Commissioner of Internal Revenue.

4

that State instrumentalities would never have sovereign

5

immunity in administrative proceedings.

6

suggesting that they might in proceedings in which

7

contempt power can be exercised, and this is not one such

8

proceeding.

9

over the entities that it regulates.

10

We're not suggesting

Rather, we're

This agency doesn't have coercive authority
It has to rely on a

Federal district court for that.

11

To make another point, I think Mr. Dean

12

emphasized that the Shipping Act allows the agency to fine

13

instrumentalities that don't comply with its order.

14

However, I should point out that in this case the

15

commission has never indicated that it has the authority

16

to fine a State instrumentality for not complying with a

17

reparation order.

18

Fourth Circuit's opinion.

19

it, and the United States in its reply brief to this Court

20

has specifically expressed the view that the FMC could not

21

fine a State-run court for not complying with the agency-

22

issued reparation order.

23

That was something that ended up in the
We've never said we could do

And finally, with respect to the issue of

24

whether and when the agency's Bureau of Enforcement can

25

intervene in an agency proceeding, I should point out that

56
Alderson Reporting Company

1

whether or not the Bureau of Enforcement intervenes in the

2

adjudication does not get to the point of whether it is an

3

agency action, because the agency always retains the

4

ability to review, sua sponte, any administrative law

5

judge order that comes out.

6

9

QUESTION:

Why is it that you cannot fine the

State?
MR. HUGHEY:

I think the United States has

suggested that because the commission and the Attorney

10

General don't have the authority to enforce a reparation

11

order against a State, that the authority to fine the

12

State for not complying with that reparation order would

13

not be an appropriate interpretation of the Shipping Act.

14

Again, that's something, the commission has

15

never said that it has the authority to, or that it would

16

fine a State for not complying with an agency-issued

17

reparation order.

18

QUESTION:

Could the commission substitute the

19

commissioners of the South Carolina Ports Authority for

20

the port authority itself?

21

MR. HUGHEY:

I'm unsure of that, Justice

22

Ginsburg, but we would suggest that the pleading

23

requirements of Ex parte Young need not be imported into

24

the Shipping Act, and that a request for, for example, a

25

cease and desist order against the ports authority would,

57
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

under the Shipping Act, be sufficient, and that the

2

complaint need not name the commissioners of the ports

3

authority themselves.

4

Thank you -- oh, sorry.

5

QUESTION:

I think what Justice Ginsburg's

6

question went to, you're saying you don't have to name the

7

individuals, but suppose that we held that you couldn't

8

name the State, do you think you have authority to name

9

the individuals?

10

MR. HUGHEY:

I'm unsure of that, Justice Scalia.

11

The Shipping Act provides that complaints must be filed

12

against persons.

13

whether the port commissioners are persons.

14

that a fiction could be conceived that they would be under

15

the Shipping Act, but again, that issue has never come up

16

in the commission's administration of the statute.

I think the question would be rather
It may be
