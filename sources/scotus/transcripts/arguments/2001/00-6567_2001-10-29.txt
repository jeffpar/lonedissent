CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Zieve -- Ms. Zieve.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MS. ZIEVE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the procedures

12

used to serve notice of forfeiture of petitioner's

13

property satisfied due process.

14

The Federal Government forfeited Mr. Dusenbery's

15

$22,000 in 1988 after mailing a notice to him at the

16

Federal prison where he was incarcerated.

17

disputed that he did not get the notice.

18

It is not

The -- the Government argues that its 1988

19

procedures satisfied due process whether or not the notice

20

was received.

21

presented here, including the Government's control over

22

the prisoner's location and knowledge of the prisoner's

23

location at all times and its control over prison

24

procedures, due process requires the Government to use

25

procedures that offer assurances of delivery to the inmate

However, in light of the circumstances

3

1

addressee and not just to prison personnel.

2

procedures --

3

QUESTION:

Such

Well, you take the position that it's

4

not sufficient that there be staff at the prison who

5

deliver mail to the inmates?

6
7

MS. ZIEVE:
sufficient.

8
9
10
11
12

The -- the procedures need --

QUESTION:

your -MS. ZIEVE:

MS. ZIEVE:

18

That -- that, in and of itself, is

inadequate as -- although -QUESTION:

16

A procedure whereby a prison employee

That, in and of itself, is not

Is in adequate?
Is inadequate, although those

procedures -QUESTION:

How can that be under any of our case

law, that that would be in adequate per se?
MS. ZIEVE:

Well, the -- under this Court's case

19

law, what's required when the notice is served is

20

determined by a consideration of a balance of factors in

21

light of the circumstances.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

And that --

Well, we've never required actual

notice in any case, have we?
MS. ZIEVE:

No, although there is some

suggestion of that in -- in a couple cases, for instance,
4

1

Phillips Petroleum.

2

the briefs, there is not a requirement of actual notice,

3

but at the same time, the Court assumes that the mailed

4

notice or the form of notice will be received, and the

5

Court hasn't considered a case where it was uncontested

6

that individual -- an individual was entitled to notice

7

and yet the notice wasn't received.

8
9

QUESTION:

But in -- in the cases discussed in

Well, but that's going to happen

sometimes with any sort of notice except the requirement

10

of actual receipt by the individual, and we've never felt

11

that destroyed the validity of the notice.

12

MS. ZIEVE:

That's true, Your Honor, but in the

13

circumstances presented here, consideration of the balance

14

of factors leads to a requirement the procedures that

15

would satisfy those factors would also lead to actual

16

notice.

17

procedures under which, after the mail is received by the

18

prison, there's not just some vague distribution process

19

at the prison, but the mail is signed for.

20

room, there's a log book kept, and when it leaves the mail

21

room a log book is kept that is ultimately signed for by

22

the inmate.

23

that there's extra care and attention paid with the

24

delivery of the notice.

25

For instance, today the Government uses

In the mail

And this chain of receipts helps to ensure

QUESTION:

Would you be satisfied with that if
5

1

that had been the case here?

2
3
4

MS. ZIEVE:

Yes.

If those procedures had been

followed.
QUESTION:

Even -- even though there was -- I

5

was going to say even though there was no receipt

6

signature, but I guess under the procedures now, the --

7

the prisoner would have signed a log.

8
9
10
11

MS. ZIEVE:

Is that right?

Yes, he would have signed a log.

And if he had a challenge and he has a signature, he's
going to lose, and if there is no signature -- excuse me.
QUESTION:

The procedure that was in place for

12

certain kinds of mail that was labeled special mail -- if

13

that had been -- if that had applied to notices in this

14

category -- special mail, as I understand it, could be

15

opened only in the presence of the prisoner?

16

MS. ZIEVE:

17

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And if that had applied, that old

18

rule had applied to this category of mail, you would not

19

object to that, would you?

20

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, the special mail opened only

21

in front of the prisoner happens after it's delivered to

22

the prisoner.

23

DEA, in recent years -- the Government writes in its

24

brief, in recent years, have considered forfeiture notices

25

and labeled those as special mail, but the procedure still

I think it's helpful that the FBI and the

6

1

needs to be adequate to get to that point where you're

2

standing in front of the prisoner opening the mail.

3

QUESTION:

Ms. Zieve, I'm -- I'm not sure what

4

-- what is the general principle of which you assert the

5

rule that you urge upon us in this case is -- is just an

6

exemplar.

7

Government is in charge of the delivery system, there must

8

be actual notice evidenced by a signature of whoever it's

9

delivered to?

10

Is the general principle that when the

MS. ZIEVE:

Your Honor, that's one important

11

factor, but the case here is even easier because there are

12

-- there are numerous --

13

QUESTION:

You're not urging that when the --

14

that the distinctive factor is that the Government is in

15

charge of the delivery system because that would have been

16

the case in the old post office when -- when the post

17

office was actually part of the Federal Government.

18

that's not the principle.

19
20

MS. ZIEVE:

So,

Right?

That's not the only factor.

Here we

have not --

21

QUESTION:

What -- what is the principle?

22

the Government is in charge of the residence?

23

we would need a similar rule for all members of the armed

24

forces.

25

MS. ZIEVE:

Right?

When
So,

There are several key factors here,
7

1

and I don't think you can separate out one circumstance

2

from the rest.

3

The inmate --

QUESTION:
Right?

Well, you said the first one isn't

4

it.

5

enough, I don't know why all in combination turn out to be

6

enough.

7

I don't understand.

MS. ZIEVE:

If neither one alone is

Because that's the circumstances.

8

There's a body of circumstances presented here.

9

inmate's location is not just easily ascertainable by the

10

Government, but determined by the Government.

11

procedures used for --

12
13

QUESTION:

MS. ZIEVE:

18

Well, that would apply -- that would

The procedures used for delivery are

also determined by the Government, and --

16
17

The

apply to all members of the armed forces.

14
15

The

QUESTION:

That would also apply to the armed

forces.
MS. ZIEVE:

And the Government is in an adverse

19

position, which I think requires additional cross checks

20

in the system to ensure that care is taken because the

21

Government doesn't have incentive to identify and rectify

22

inefficiencies on its own.

23

QUESTION:

You really think that that's

24

realistic here?

You would not urge us to apply this rule

25

in a civil action where your client was being served a
8

1

paper by -- by someone who is not the Government.

2

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, if the -- if the serving party

3

were not the Government, then the person doing the service

4

would not be the person who was also in control of the

5

delivery procedures.

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. ZIEVE:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

I understand that.
So -So, you have not urged the rule in

that case, only when the Government is -- is the opposing
party.

11

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, I'm not trying to be evasive,

12

but it's hard to answer without knowing all the

13

circumstances there.

14

QUESTION:

For instance, what would be the -All the other circumstances are just

15

like this one except that the complaint was not on behalf

16

of the Government.

17

MS. ZIEVE:

It was behalf on a private individual.
Well, then the private individual

18

wouldn't have control over the procedures.

19

that mailing wasn't -- wasn't adequate in that

20

circumstance.

21

property.

22

It might be

It might have to do with the value of the

QUESTION:

You can answer this yes or no.

Do

23

you assert that your rule would apply in that situation or

24

not?

25

difference is the complaint was not filed by the

All of the circumstances are the same.

9

The only

1
2
3
4

Government, but by a private party.
QUESTION:

Say it was for an ordinary debt, that

the prisoner owed money and the creditor brought suit.
MS. ZIEVE:

It might not apply in that

5

circumstance, but whether or not it does, this is an

6

easier case.

7

QUESTION:

Let -- let me ask you.

I -- I take

8

it you begin from the premise that mailed notice is

9

adequate for a civil suit, or do you?

I'm going to ask

10

the Government the same thing.

11

write an opinion that -- that says that mailed notice is

12

adequate in any civil suit?

13

MS. ZIEVE:

No.

I -- are we supposed to

The -- in fact, under rule 4(d)

14

mailed notice is not adequate under civil suit -- for any

15

civil suit.

16

But I don't think --

QUESTION:

From a constitutional -- I know what

17

4(e) says, but from a constitutional standpoint, is mailed

18

notice adequate in any civil suit?

19
20
21

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, I think it's probably not

adequate in any civil suit.
QUESTION:

All right.

What is -- what is it

22

about this that makes mailed notice adequate whereas

23

apparently there's another class of cases in which

24

personal service is required?

25

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, this case -10

1

QUESTION:

You -- you begin I -- I think with

2

the assumption that mailed notice would be adequate, and

3

the question is, are these mailing procedures adequate in

4

this case?

5

MS. ZIEVE:

6

QUESTION:

Well, no, Your Honor -But I'm -- I don't want to have you

7

take a position you don't take.

8

me that that is the baseline assumption from where you

9

begin the argument.

10

MS. ZIEVE:

But it -- it does seem to

Am I correct about that?
Not exactly, Your Honor.

This case

11

is not really a mailed notice case because the procedures

12

that are inadequate are the procedures that happened after

13

the mailing.

14

delivery chain, and the question here is the adequacy of

15

the procedures after that.

16

The mailing is the first step in the

QUESTION:

But I'm asking why is mail adequate

17

at all?

18

decide the case on that basis.

19

assumption that if the mail were received, the mailed

20

notice would be adequate.

21
22
23

You seem to assume that, and that's fine.

MS. ZIEVE:

We can

But you make the

If the mail is received by the

inmate?
QUESTION:

Yes.

And I want to know why that is.

24

I'm going to ask the Government.

25

case, it would seem to me that at least an argument could
11

If we have to write this

1

be made that personal service is required --

2

MS. ZIEVE:

3

QUESTION:

Well --- in any civil case.

And then we

4

ask if this is a forfeiture or there's some old hangover

5

from the in rem idea that is still somehow affecting us

6

even though we don't talk about in rem anymore and so

7

forth.

8
9
10
11

But I want to know what your -- your beginning
principle is for the due process, elementary, minimum
standards of service.
MS. ZIEVE:

The mailed notice is any form of

12

delivery -- any form of notice is adequate as to that

13

individual if it's received.

14

adequate when it's received, and in this case, the

15

Government's procedures used certified mail so that you

16

know that the mail was received.

17

mailed the certified mail to the proper prison and it had

18

not been received, the certified mail slip never came

19

back, then I don't think the mailed service would have

20

been adequate.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

The mailed notice is

If the Government had

Have any of our cases ever required

certified mail?
MS. ZIEVE:

Well, the first case where the Court

24

considers whether mailed notices is constitutional in Hess

25

v. Pawloski, the mail at issue was certified mail.
12

1

Subsequent to that, the Court hasn't made a distinction

2

between the form of mail.

3

The Court also hasn't considered the case where

4

mail was sent but not received.

5

Mennonite Board and Tulsa Professional Collection

6

Services, in the cases discussed in the briefs, the

7

question was whether an individual was entitled to notice

8

in addition to publication or posting, not whether -- the

9

Court had no occasion to consider what would happen if the

10
11

And the Court's cases in

notice was mailed but never got there.
QUESTION:

It seems to me one of the

12

difficulties I find with your position, Ms. Zieve, is that

13

this inquiry can come up, you know, months and maybe years

14

after the actual notice took place or didn't take place.

15

And it's one thing to say we have a -- you followed a

16

system and that system affords due process, but to have

17

every case turn on perhaps an argument between the person

18

who's seeking to set aside the service -- I never received

19

it -- and someone else saying, yes, you did receive it, I

20

think is rather unsatisfactory.

21

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, that's why the procedures

22

should require proof of verification which the

23

Government's procedures do today.

24

served with a forfeiture notice today, he would be

25

required to sign for it and there would be no question
13

If Mr. Dusenbery was

1

later about whether or not he received it.

2

QUESTION:

Was he not --

3

QUESTION:

Your --

4

QUESTION:

The question I'd have is we all seem

5

to agree now that the question -- the Government has to

6

provide reasonable procedures.

7

reasonably calculated to give actual notice.

8

MS. ZIEVE:

9

QUESTION:

Reasonable means

Under the circumstances.
Well, don't say -- there's no such

10

thing.

11

doesn't add anything I don't think.

12

reasonably calculated to give actual notice.

13

figured out your qualification, how that would work.

14
15

There's no such thing.

I haven't

Precisely what's

wrong with these procedures in your opinion?
MS. ZIEVE:

17

QUESTION:

19

You say is it

But why wasn't this precisely?

16

18

Under the circumstances

The -Why are they not calculated to give

actual notice reasonably?
MS. ZIEVE:

The 1988 procedures did not provide

20

assurances of delivery because what happened after the

21

mail reached the mail room is -- was vague and

22

undocumented.

23

And as the Government acknowledged --

QUESTION:

I always thought the procedure -- I

24

thought the -- what -- what -- tell me precisely.

25

the procedure is, A, mailed to a prison.
14

I think

B, it comes to a

1

prison, and a person who works for the prison signs for

2

it.

3

required?

4

Then the procedure required what?

C.

What was it

And then what should it have required?
MS. ZIEVE:

The procedure was that the mail room

5

employee picked up the mail and signed the certified mail

6

receipt at the post office, brought it back to the prison,

7

where he entered it in a log book.

8

testified that in 1988 the procedure then would have been

9

that a -- a housing unit staff would have signed when he

10

took the mail -- the certified mail out of the mail room.

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. ZIEVE:

13

A prison employee

Yes.
He also testified that he didn't

know what the procedure was after that.

14

QUESTION:

All right.

I guess after that -- a

15

reasonable person would think the procedure after that is

16

you give it to the person it's addressed to.

17

mean that would be normal in life.

18

that that wasn't the procedure?

19

MS. ZIEVE:

No.

QUESTION:

Okay.

20
21

Now, is -- I

Is there any testimony

No.

There was no testimony about

that.
Now, we've described the

22

procedure, and now you tell me what, in your opinion, is

23

wrong with that procedure.

24
25

MS. ZIEVE:

The procedure doesn't require

verification of delivery and that -15

1

QUESTION:

Okay.

So, in your opinion, it is

2

unreasonable not to have an additional step that the

3

prisoner signs for it.

4

MS. ZIEVE:

Yes, and the reason is this.

5

Because the documentation -- the improved documentation

6

improves delivery.

7

of Prisons memorandum that the Solicitor General lodged

8

with the Court both in 1999 and 2001 -- it ties improved

9

documentation to improved delivery.

10

The -- the Department of Justice Board

QUESTION:

Then -- then whenever there's a

11

requirement or -- a requirement -- procedure for service

12

by mail, it should be certified mail so the person signs

13

for it in every case.

14

MS. ZIEVE:

15

QUESTION:

In -Ms. Zieve, you couldn't say every

16

case because in Mullane regular mail was adequate in that

17

under the circumstances, which was heavily emphasized by

18

Justice Jackson, those words, under the circumstances.

19

MS. ZIEVE:

In Mullane and in some cases where

20

there's a class of interested parties where everyone has

21

this same interest, it might not be necessary for all

22

interested parties to receive the notice.

23

recognized in Mullane, because there were many

24

beneficiaries of a 113 different trusts and they all had a

25

identical interests -16

As the Court

1

QUESTION:

All right.

Then I'll -- then I'll

2

amend my question.

3

defendant and service is permitted by mail, it must be by

4

certified mail.

5

In a case where there is only a single

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, that would likely be

6

reasonable since the burden of doing so is so small and

7

the increased -- the decreased risk of it not reaching the

8

addressee would be --

9

QUESTION:

10

reasonable.

11

That's your argument.

You don't mean that it might

You mean it isn't reasonable not to do it.

12

MS. ZIEVE:

13

QUESTION:

Right.
It isn't reasonable not to do it.

14

And I guess a person who thought it was reasonable not to

15

do it would say, well, we can't think of everything, and

16

you know, it's in the prison, and prisons normally do

17

work.

18

fairly disciplined order.

19

your response to that is what?

20

MS. ZIEVE:

21
22

I mean, they're not great, but they have a -- a

circumstances.

And so, it's good enough.

And

It wasn't good enough in -- in these

The Government has shown us --

QUESTION:

Well, they might -- they might say

23

more than that.

They might say we have no reason to

24

believe that the prison delivery system is any worse than

25

the post office's delivery system.
17

1

And I -- I guess it's your -- I guess it's your

2

contention that even if the reason your client never

3

received the notice was -- had nothing to do with the

4

fault of the -- of the prison.

5

that lost the -- the notice on the way.

6

-- that would still invalidate the service.

7
8

MS. ZIEVE:

It was the Postal Service
That would still
Right?

It would still mean the forfeiture

was done without adequate notice.

9

QUESTION:

So that -- so -- which would not be

10

the case, I suppose, unless you're going to adopt the

11

certified mail rule, which would not be the case for an

12

ordinary citizen who is not incarcerated.

13

sent to an ordinary citizen and the post office looses it,

14

unless you adopt the certified mail rule, that would be

person, if the post office looses it, it is not adequate

notice.

18

If notice is

But in the case of an incarcerated

Right?
MS. ZIEVE:

Well, I don't know that it would be

19

adequate notice to serve someone by mail out of prison if

20

it's not received.

21

QUESTION:

Well, what is -- what is the

22

statutory requirement in your view for forfeiture as -- as

23

far as notice is concerned?

get the signature of every person who has some interest in

Take the other extreme case.

People forfeit

People have tort actions against ships, and you

And where you bring the action against the

19

1

that ship, for example.

2

do you have to get the signature?

3

Now, I think, am I not right, or

If -- if, for example, you're bringing an action

4

against a thing and the thing is owned by millions,

5

thousands, or hundreds, does the -- do you have to

6

normally, under the rules -- forget the Constitution for

7

the moment -- you have to get the signature on a -- on

8

that notice, a return receipt requested of each person who

9

has an interest in that thing?

10

MS. ZIEVE:

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. ZIEVE:

Under the statute?
Yes.
Now, you've asked a sort of

13

complicated question because the statute for an in rem

14

judicial forfeiture requires publication, but the

15

Government, based on this Court's case law, gives notice

16

by certified mail.

17

QUESTION:

But I take it your argument would be

18

that even if all the signatures are not required in the in

19

rem case, there is -- there is a fairness in the procedure

20

that would not require actual notice and signatures to

21

every ship owner because the owner of the ship at least

22

has some right to control the ship.

23

-- if they don't pay attention to what's happening to

24

their ship, we -- we can tag them with that.

25

So, you say, look, if

But the difference between that case and this,
20

1

as I understand it, is there is a period between delivery

2

of the letter and what should be the point of receipt by

3

the prisoner when the prisoner is not in control of the

4

process.

5

we assume regularity on the post office is normally

6

enough, that isn't enough here because there's a hiatus

7

between where the post office stops and the point at which

8

we hope the prisoner gets the delivery.

9

The post office has finished its part.

So, if

And I take it you would be satisfied in this

10

case, even without a rule requiring actual signature, if

11

the Government were required to show, with a greater

12

detail than you say it has here, that there was a regular

13

procedure, at the time involved here, that makes it just

14

as probable that the letter would have gotten from the

15

front door of the prison to the prisoner, as it is

16

probable that the letter mailed in the box gets to the

17

front door of the prison.

18

kind of a rule, wouldn't you?

19
20

MS. ZIEVE:

I'm not -- it's not -- it's

not important to petitioner how the procedures --

21
22

Yes.

You'd be satisfied with that

QUESTION:
wins.

How he wins the case as long as he

I realize that.

23

(Laughter.)

24

MS. ZIEVE:

25

QUESTION:

No.
I mean, you would -- you would be
21

1

satisfied if -- if we had the -- I take it, the same kind

2

of demand for proof of regularity for the period between

3

the front door of the prison and the prisoner's cell that

4

we do from the mailbox to the front door of the prison.

5

That would be a reasonable system.

6

satisfied with it, I would take it, as a general rule.

7

MS. ZIEVE:

8

QUESTION:

9

And -- and you'd be

Probably.
It would be nice to have a signature

requirement, but basically we -- we would have the same

10

kind of rule then that we have with -- with respect to

11

mail delivery in general.

12

MS. ZIEVE:

Yes, but the reason that I emphasize

13

the signature is because, as the Bureau of Prisons has

14

since recognized, the -- the signature does help to

15

improve delivery.

16

is treated with some extra attention and care.

17

that it's not going to get misdelivered to Larry Smith two

18

cells over.

19
20
21

It helps to make sure that this letter

QUESTION:

It ensures

What do we do with prisoners who

won't sign?
MS. ZIEVE:

Well, actually the Board of Prisons

22

procedures deal with that, and I think effectively, which

23

is on the log book, if the prisoner refuses to sign, then

24

the person delivering the mail signs for it stating that

25

the prisoner won't sign, which I think is comparable to a
22

1

process server giving a contemporaneous statement that

2

service has been completed.

3

QUESTION:

You know, it seems to me we need to

4

focus on some kind of a test, and I thought I understood

5

you to argue for a test that says in these prison cases,

6

there has to be actual receipt by the prisoner.

7

I know the Third Circuit and probably the Fourth have a

8

different sort of test, which is that the Government just

9

has to show that internal prison delivery procedures are

10

adequate.

11

test?

12

And I --

Is that an acceptable general statement of the

MS. ZIEVE:

They have to be adequate.

My view

13

is that under this Court's -- the analysis that this Court

14

has used in its cases, in its due process cases, that

15

applying that general statement leads to the same result

16

that I'm arguing for here, although if the Court --

17
18
19

QUESTION:

You say it isn't adequate unless

there's actual receipt.
MS. ZIEVE:

Yes, because those procedures are --

20

it's entirely practicable to do that.

21

not difficult to --

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

There's -- it is

Well, in the event we don't agree

with you, what's your fall-back position?
MS. ZIEVE:

Well, even under the Third Circuit's

formulation, the Court, looking at the 1988 procedures in
23

1

the record, such as they are -- those procedures were

2

inadequate.

3

notice, and the procedures as described, are inadequate,

4

although for the same reasons as I think lead to actual

5

notice, even if you don't want to go that far.

6

It's uncontested that he didn't get the

QUESTION:

Why is it that a procedure is

7

inadequate if the procedure is that if we get certified

8

mail, we -- we deliver it to the prisoner?

9

inadequate about that as a procedural standard?

10

MS. ZIEVE:

What's

Again, it doesn't provide the

11

assurances of delivery that both are feasible because, if

12

you're going to deliver it, it doesn't take that much to

13

just get the signature, and because I think it's important

14

to have cross checks to make sure that the Government --

15

QUESTION:

Do we look back at Mullane or at

16

Mathews v. Eldridge for our guidance here in establishing

17

a standard?

18

MS. ZIEVE:

I think either one, Your Honor.

19

Mullane states -- sort of states the test in one sentence,

20

but I think summarizes the three-part framework that

21

Mathews articulates later.

22

the factors to consider, all lead to same -- to the result

Either way you can reach the

charge.

4

QUESTION:

-- apply this rule to any -- anything

5

other than prisons or are you talking about the

6

circumstances of someone incarcerated by the Government?

7

Is there any other setting in which you would require not

8

merely that certified mail be sent and signed for by

9

someone, but in-hand delivery?

10

MS. ZIEVE:

There may be other cases, though

11

there also may not be.

12

any circumstances where actual notice is required, it's

13

got to be these where the Government is both the sender

14

and sort of the recipient for later delivery to the person

15

who it knows where it is --

16

QUESTION:

This is the easy case.

Why is it the easy case?

If there's

It is the

17

case, I take it from your argument, because you haven't

18

suggested that there might be another setting other than

19

where the Government has someone in confinement.

20

MS. ZIEVE:

21

QUESTION:

No, I haven't.
Is it any part of your argument that

22

we should be suspicious of prison officials because they

23

may use a refusal to follow their procedures for

24

vindictive reasons or anything like that?

25

MS. ZIEVE:

That may occur, Your Honor, but our
25

1

argument does not rely on any malfeasance on the

2

Government's part.

3

QUESTION:

That's not your argument.

4

QUESTION:

Well, if that's not part of your

5

argument, I don't see why your situation is any different

6

from the military situation where, unless -- unless the

7

serviceman or woman is AWOL, the Government knows right

8

where that person is and the Government is responsible for

9

-- for where that person is.

10

wouldn't have the same rule.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4

MR. MINEAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

5

This Court has repeatedly held that the notice

6

requirements of the Due Process Clause are satisfied by a

7

method of notice that's reasonably calculated to provide

8

interested parties with notice of the proceedings.

9

The Government's method of providing notice in

10

this case, this forfeiture case, satisfies that test.

11

method was by the use of certified mail.

12

does not dispute that mails generally are satisfactory for

13

purposes of notice.

14

only in the case of prisoners is that method unwarranted

15

or unconstitutional.

16

And petitioner

Rather they draw the distinction that

Petitioner is asserting a constitutional

17

violation.

18

establishing the procedures the Government used are

19

unconstitutional.

20

It therefore has the burden of proof of

And I'd like to clarify a point with regard to

21

whether notice was received here or not.

22

has not submitted that notice was not received.

23

are unable to prove that it was not received.

24
25

The

QUESTION:

The Government
We simply

So, why not just put the burden on

the person who was supposed to get it to prove he didn't
27

1

get it?

2

MR. MINEAR:

Well, that is in fact what the

3

court did.

4

but the inquiry was made, and the court concluded that

5

whatever the protestations of the defendant might be, or

6

the prisoner in this case, nevertheless the method that

7

was used here was reasonably calculated to reach him.

8

that is all that Mullane requires.

9

It didn't -- there wasn't a test it required,

QUESTION:

No, no.

And

Look, what I take it that

10

she's arguing for is there's a step missing here and it

11

should apply not just to prisoners, apply to anybody who's

12

going to have their property forfeited, and that is, you

13

give them notice by certified mail so they have to sign

14

it.

15

armed forces, everybody.

16

isn't that hard to do.

17

against losing your property without even knowing about

18

it.

That's the point.

MR. MINEAR:

20

QUESTION:

22

And what's wrong with that?

It

It protects pretty thoroughly

So, do it.

19

21

So, it would apply to everybody,

The problem -That's -- that's basically, as I

understand it, the argument.
MR. MINEAR:

The problem with that position is

23

it's contrary to 50 years of this Court's precedence,

24

which has consistently recognized that mailing alone --

25

not certified mail -- but ordinary mail, is sufficient to
28

1

provide parties with notice.

2

QUESTION:

Where did the Court hold that?

3

QUESTION:

Have we ever said that with reference

4

to a simple contract or tort action?

5

MR. MINEAR:

No.

All of the cases in which this

6

issue has arisen in this Court's jurisprudence have

7

involved special procedures.

8
9

QUESTION:

Nevertheless --

Well, that's why I'm asking because

in Mullane and subsequent cases, we have tended to say

10

that the in rem/in personam distinction is -- is not too

11

clear a line.

12

Are you arguing for the proposition that, again,

13

in a standard contract or tort case, notice by mail would

14

be sufficient?

15

MR. MINEAR:

We are certainly willing to defend

16

the proposition that the Federal Rules of Procedure, which

17

provide --

18
19
20

QUESTION:

No.

I'm talking about -- I'm talking

about due process requirements now.
MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

And -- and with regard to the

21

Federal Rules, they do recognize that service can be

22

effected through mail -- through the notice of waiver

23

provisions that are set forth there, and we would defend

24

the constitutionality of those provisions which allow the

25

party to, in fact, accept service by notice.
29

1

QUESTION:

If this Court writes a due process

2

opinion, can we say that mail, routine mail, is always

3

sufficient, or are there some cases in which you must have

4

personal service?

5

MR. MINEAR:

6

that.

7

in this case.

We might caution that it's not necessary to do that

8
9
10

Well, the Court can certainly do

QUESTION:

Well, I want to know what the

principle is that you're -- that controls our case, the
beginning principle here.

11

MR. MINEAR:

The Court has drawn these

12

principles largely from common experience and knowledge

13

about the instrumentalities that are used for purposes of

14

service.

15

cited that the mails had, through common experience, been

16

determined to be a reasonable means for providing service

17

in that type of proceeding.

18

And if we looked at the Mullane case, the Court

Now, whether the Court would want to take the

19

step of saying that the mails are always adequate in any

20

proceeding is a step that's not necessary for the Court to

21

take.

22

it ought to do so.

23

this case because this case involves procedures that are

24

very similar to Tulsa, to Mennonite, to Schroeder, to --

25

And so, I'm hesitant to suggest to the Court that

QUESTION:

It certainly does not need to do so in

All right.
30

So, then you are relying

1

on the fact that this is a forfeiture case and we're --

2

there's this voice of the past of in rem versus in

3

personam hanging over this -- this argument of yours.

4

MR. MINEAR:

Well, actually no, Your Honor.

5

It's not the in rem nature of the proceedings, but rather

6

it's a -- it's an intersection of two factors.

7

One, this type of proceeding is similar to the

8

proceedings this Court has dealt with previously that are

9

not necessarily in rem.

For instance, probate claims are

10

not necessarily -- would not necessarily be treated as in

11

rem I think under -- under traditional law.

12

it's the intersection of the fact that these proceedings

13

are similar to proceedings elsewhere that the Court has

14

already ruled on and the fact that this Court can draw on

15

its long experience the mails are, in fact, as a practical

16

matter, a reasonable means for providing service or

17

providing notice.

18

QUESTION:

But it's --

I'm just very puzzled by your

19

reliance on Mullane when Justice Jackson took such care to

20

say this procedure, common trust fund, so many

21

beneficiaries, some unknown, some addresses lost -- if we

22

use regular mail, the chances are it will get to many, if

23

not most, people in the group, and that's good enough for

24

that kind of case.

25

that once belonged to an individual, not 113 trusts

Here we're talking about some $12,000

31

1

combined together in a common fund with hundreds, even

2

thousands of beneficiaries.

3

QUESTION:

Your Honor, Mullane has been extended

4

beyond the facts of its individual case.

5

is, in fact, quite similar to the Court's most recent

6

decisions, such as Tulsa Professional Services.

7

case, I believe there was some $12,000 in medical fees

8

that were in dispute.

9

couldn't count on other claimants, as in Mullane, to

10

And this case

In that

The -- the creditor in that case

perhaps make the arguments that that creditor might --

11

QUESTION:

Well, but that was with the probate

12

proceeding.

13

and what I've been trying to -- to explore with you, this

14

is a case where a person has an ownership interest.

15

not that much different from an ordinary contract or tort

16

action.

17

And as Justice Ginsburg's questions point out

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, Your Honor.

It's

And we think that

18

this case is similar to Tulsa and ought to be treated as

19

such.

20

beyond the facts of this case and to deal with the

21

question of a civil complaint and whether ordinary --

22

I'm simply reluctant to urge this Court to go

QUESTION:

I suppose -- I suppose in probate a

23

claimant, a debtor claimant, is in much the same standing

24

as a person who sues in contract on that claim before the

25

person dies.
32

1

MR. MINEAR:

Well, yes.

But probate is very

2

similar to the situation here, that the notice that is

3

being provided is simply to ascertain whether there are

4

any claims outstanding to the property at issue.

5

person does make a claim, then that initiates a judicial

6

procedure in which further process would be necessary.

7

But this case is --

8

QUESTION:

9

And if a

Here there's no doubt about the

person who has the interest.

It was not like sending out

10

a notice:

11

Government knows who the person in the world is who has a

12

claim to this $12,000.

13

any interested people come forward.

MR. MINEAR:

The

But, Your Honor, the same could be

14

said, for instance, in Mennonite with regard to the

15

mortgagee, that the person who is -- that -- that was a

16

situation in which there was an interest in -- in

17

foreclosing on a property and selling it at a tax sale.

18

Now, the Government in that situation certainly could have

19

identified the mortgagor and simply provided notice by

20

publication.

21

sufficient.

22

applied in that --

This Court said that notice by mail was
It was the minimum that was necessary and it

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. MINEAR:

25

QUESTION:

-- better than publication generally.
Yes.
-- publication is the least
33

1

effective, and the Mullane case that you rely on so

2

heavily makes that point.

3

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, and that's the reason why the

4

Government in these situations provides notice by

5

publication, also by notice to the person's last address,

6

and also notice to his current address if it can be

7

ascertained.

8

reasonable diligence, was able to locate the individual

9

and send notice to his place of incarceration.

10

In this case, the Government, through

The only thing that distinguishes this case, in

11

fact, is that the mails are being directed to a prison,

12

and the only real question here is whether the prison

13

system is reliable.

14

in fact, it was.

15

that the mails were delivered to prisoners.

16

And what we established at trial was,

There were procedures in place to ensure

QUESTION:

Fine.

Then you would win even under

17

their rule because then the prisoner would be unable to

18

prove that he didn't get the notice.

19

So, assume that that's the rule.

The prisoner

20

has to prove he didn't get the notice.

21

-- who actually gets notice loses.

22

like to know is, assuming that, what is the argument

23

against saying where it's a forfeiture case and where the

24

forfeiting -- the person who's going to get the property

25

knows the address of the individual who would forfeit the
34

Anyone who doesn't

Assume that.

What I'd

property, that person has to use certified mail?

2

said was the Government does that anyway in forfeiture

3

cases.

4

MR. MINEAR:

What she

The argument against that, Your

5

Honor, is that the Due Process Clause simply specifies the

6

constitutional minimum.

7

decision to provide more process than is necessary.

QUESTION:

Fine.

And my question is, what is --

if you're in the Government, aside from -- well, it's a

little easier.

11

it?

12

The Government can make a

The reason -- there -- there are

MR. MINEAR:

I mean, the harm that it will do

require, for instance, as the Chief Justice has pointed

23

out, similar service on the armed services.

25

the record.

It also would

For instance, it's my understanding that the
35

1

Postal Service delivers mail to dormitories and

2

residential halls in bulk for distribution to the people

3

that live in those halls.

4

QUESTION:

So --

So, I want an example, since you're

5

writing the address anyway -- I want an example of the

6

problem that would be caused by saying you not only have

7

to write the address, you also have to send it certified,

8

whether it's to dormitories, armed forces, prisoners, or

9

anyone else in the world.

10
11

What's the actual practical

problem that would cause the Government?
MR. MINEAR:

Well, I cannot say that the

12

Government cannot overcome that difficulty, because it

13

does in fact use certified mail.

14

But the problem is should the Court erect that

15

as a constitutional standard, and the difficulties with

16

erecting that as a constitutional standard, as I pointed

17

out before, is it will be very difficult to cabin that to

18

a wide variety of other situations --

19

QUESTION:

With certified mail, you have to get

20

a signature from the recipient, whereas with ordinary

21

mail, you can put it in the slot in your mailbox.

22

other words, it's often difficult to obtain the certified

23

mail signature in a way that it wouldn't be to get the

24

ordinary mail slot.

25

MR. MINEAR:

That's correct.
36

And, for

In

1

example --

2
3

QUESTION:

But shouldn't it be difficult if

you're going to take $20,000 away from them?

4

MR. MINEAR:

Your Honor, but again, this case is

5

on -- on par with other cases that involved similar

6

amounts of money.

7

And with regard to the signature -- obtaining

8

the signature, my suggestion is it might be that the

9

litigation will shift from the assertions that we think in

10

many cases are -- are untrue, that the person did not

11

receive the notice, that, well, a guard signed for me and

12

never actually -- I did not refuse to receive it and a

13

guard simply signed and said that I refused.

14

What we're trying to do from a policy

15

perspective, from the Bureau of Prisons' perspective, is

16

to eliminate the sort of wasteful litigation that takes

17

place over assertions.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Minear, the Third Circuit has

19

apparently adopted a test that requires the Government to

20

show a little more than that it dropped a notice in the

21

mail, and that, in fact, the Government must show that

22

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Is that a -- a standard that the

Government would find satisfactory?
MR. MINEAR:

We disagree with that, Your Honor,

for the reasons set forth in Judge Alito's dissenting

5

opinion on -- on that ground; namely, that it imposes

burdens that are not necessary.

procedures has been shown.

10

QUESTION:

The burden is on the

But your -- your argument, it seems

11

to me, is premised on the fact that forfeiture is like an

12

in rem proceeding and it's just different.

13

-- I'm not sure that this is -- assume that there's a

14

constitutional due process requirement for personal

18

MR. MINEAR:

19

QUESTION:

20
21
22

Why should this

The reason -- the reason why -That may be an heroic assumption.

I'm not sure that's true.

I think -- let me go back.

Do you know of any State which in an ordinary
civil action allows service by mail as a routine matter?

23

MR. MINEAR:

24

QUESTION:

25

Assume with me

I don't know of -Absent unavailability or the fact

that the person is avoiding the process server or
38

1

something like that?

MR. MINEAR:

I don't know of any State that

allows ordinary mail.

have adopted certified mail with return receipt requested.

I believe that California follows that pattern.

were based on that -- on that approach.

I believe that a number of States

QUESTION:

Okay.

9

But then -- then going back to the other

10

question, it seems to me your case is premised on the

11

assumption that this is a forfeiture in rem type,

12

different action than -- than a routine contract or tort

13

action.

14

MR. MINEAR:

Well, we certainly do think it

15

falls on the side of the -- of the line that this other --

16

the other cases of this Court demarcs, namely probate

17

proceedings, tax sales, condemnation proceedings, notice

18

of forcible entry and detainer proceedings, which are

19

basically ejectment proceedings.

20

proceedings have involved situations where this Court

21

indicated that notice by ordinary mail would be

22

sufficient.

Now, we go beyond that.

May I ask you?

This is prompted by

Justice Scalia's question.

special procedures for people in the military?

MR. MINEAR:

Does the Government have any

I'm not aware of any special

5

procedures that -- that we provide in those situations.

6

For instance, if there was forfeiture --

And I should think there's a lot of

11

nothing in the record about that, is there?

12

He may never

I'm just wondering if the -- there's

MR. MINEAR:

No.

There's nothing in the record

13

and it's not clear to me at all that if there was a

14

forfeiture that was directed to a serviceman, it would be

15

treated any differently.

16

QUESTION:

What about the -- the immunity while

17

the person -- there's an immunity that governs people in

18

the military during the time.

statute?

20
21
22

QUESTION:

The Soldier's and Sailor's Civil

Relief Act.
MR. MINEAR:

Yes, and I'm not sure how that

23

would apply in this situation.

24

the type of requirement --

25

Is it -- what is that

QUESTION:

It might very well toll

It would toll the statute of

limitations because the person could assert immunity for

2

the period that they're in service.

3

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

I'm simply not certain how

4

that would apply.

5

procedures -- for civil forfeitures, the regulations of

6

the FBI do provide mechanisms such as mitigation and

7

remission that can ameliorate some of the hardships, where

8

a party can actually show that there was nonreceipt.

But I do know that for general civil

But can I ask you a question that

puzzles me about this?

11

regulations, there was this special mail category and

12

several things fell into it, including letters that the

13

prisoner would get from the attorney.

14

opened in the presence of the prisoner?

15

MR. MINEAR:

16

QUESTION:

The -- even before the current

Those have to be

That's correct.
And then there was this category

called law enforcement.

19

within the special mail category?

20

MR. MINEAR:

And why wasn't a notice of this

I think for a short while the DEA

21

and the FBI did follow the practice of denominating

22

certain mails as special mail.

23

special mail category existed in 1988.

24

record is clear on that.

25

I'm not sure if the
I don't think the

I would point out, however, that under the
41

1

Bureau of Prisons operations memorandum, there is more

2

protection to providing it by certified mail rather than

3

by special mail, primarily because of the long period of

4

retention of the log books for certified mail.

5

the practice for -- the current practice of BOP --

6

QUESTION:

And so,

That applies to the Federal system,

7

but the rule we're working with today would apply to State

forfeitures as well, the State prisons and the like.

9

your rules don't necessarily tell us what would happen in

10

So,

a -- to a State prisoner.

11

MR. MINEAR:

No, they do not, although I think

12

that the -- the Court can -- can safely assume that State

13

prisons do, in fact, provide for mail delivery to their

14

prisoners.

15

QUESTION:

Would you just comment on the

16

suggestion that your opponent has made, in effect, that

17

there really ought to be a special rule for people who are

18

in the custody of the Federal Government?

19

with Justice Scalia that would include military personnel

20

too.

21

they know darned well where a person is, there's no reason

22

to have three publications in the local newspaper?

23

just make sure you get it to -- to where the man is.

24
25

And I assume

Is there -- would it make sense to say that when

MR. MINEAR:

You

Well, there's no reason to depart

-- that's certainly -- the fact that we know where the
42

1

person is, certainly does dictate that we contact the

2

person by mail, and that's inconsistent with Mullane and

3

its progeny, that where the address is reasonably

4

ascertainable, the person should be contacted by mail.

5

The fact that we have the person under our

6

control I don't think adds anything to that.

The basic

7

question is, is this notice reasonably certain to reach

8

the inmate?

9

he's at a location of our choosing or some other location.

And if it does, it doesn't really matter if

10

It's simply what's important here is, is this method, is

11

the procedure reasonably certain to provide actual notice?

Is there any court action -- if you

accepted your -- your points and said, look, they send it

there, it's certified.

Act because it does exclude intentional torts.

There

through the prison administrative remedies or through a

MR. MINEAR:

There is

conceivably an opportunity to seek damages based on

negligence, although you'd have to show an absence of --

of due care.

Let me make sure I understand your

position on one point.

Is it your view that that even if

you had not use certified mail in this case, but just used

regular mail and an affidavit by the Secretary that it was

do beyond constitutional requirements in order to --

QUESTION:

Yes.

It's our view that that would
The procedures that we

Mr. Minear, am I correct that the --

24

that the current method of simply providing written notice

25

is -- you -- you maintain that that is method that
44

1

Congress has specified in 19 U.S.C. 1607(a)?

2

MR. MINEAR:

The method of -- the requirement of

of our briefs.

It is 1607(a).

MR. MINEAR:

To each party -What do you think that means?

How

Well, normally by mail, and we

think that it's --

20

QUESTION:

It doesn't say shall be sent by

21

certified mail.

22

Congress thought was adequate was -- was by mail.

23

I think it's -- a fair reading of what

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

I think that by ordinary

24

mail.

And I think -- as I say, the certified mail

25

procedure is something that the Bureau of Prisons and the
45

1

agencies have adopted in order to disprove false claims of

2

nonreceipt.

That's its principal purpose.

3

But it's our position that ordinary mail is

4

sufficient here as it would be in the wide variety of

5

other cases, comparable other cases, this Court has

6

addressed.

7

QUESTION:

How do you think the Sixth Circuit

8

standard differs from the Third Circuit's and the

9

Fourth's?

10

MR. MINEAR:

I think as a practical matter, Your

11

Honor, there's primarily a question of the burden of

12

proof.

13

-- if we are challenged, if there's a challenge to whether

14

mail was -- was received or not, it's the obligation of

15

that party who's raising the challenge to prove the lack

16

of reasonableness.

17

Under the Sixth Circuit's standard, we are simply

QUESTION:

Well, but here the Government is

18

seeking to forfeit property from someone.

19

unreasonable to think that the Government has the burden

20

of proving that notice was given or reasonably calculated

21

to be given.

22

MR. MINEAR:

Maybe it's not

Well, the Government met that

23

burden in this case, but again, we don't think that that

24

should be the test.

25

obligation of the party to show that -- what defects are

Rather, we think that it's the

46

1

necessary.

2

proof of inadequacy that petitioner showed was his claim

3

that he did not receive the notice, and we in return

4

indicated there were procedures in place that would have

5

ascertained the mail.

6

And in this case, the only defect -- the only

Now, because the issue is joined, it's likely

7

the Government would be required or would find it

8

necessary or useful to put forward information about

9

procedures.

10

But the problem with the Third Circuit standard

11

is it requires that we, ex ante, at the very beginning of

12

the process, go through and determine what procedures are

13

in various prisons.

14

that seems particularly inappropriate with regard to State

15

prisons where we think it's reasonable for us to send --

16

to mail the receipts to the prisons with the expectation

17

that those State prisons will forward the mail

18

appropriately.

19

QUESTION:

And that doesn't seem particularly --

Mr. Minear, we have a smattering of

20

courts of appeals cases addressing the issue that we've

21

got today, but beyond that, I don't know how much

22

litigation there is about this.

23

of how much time in forfeiture cases is spent litigating

24

the question of notice?

25

MR. MINEAR:

Do we have any indication

I don't know the answer to that,
47

1

Your Honor.

2

2000, the Government, the DEA and the FBI, sent out

3

roughly 9,000 notices of forfeiture to their incarcerated

4

prisoners.

5

know the answer to that, but certainly there is the

6

possibility of a substantial clog on the courts,

7

particularly over claims of nonreceipt which are so easily

8

made.

9

As we point out in the brief, in the year

Now, how many of those are contested, I don't

QUESTION:

Well, except that I -- I don't know

10

that the -- that that argument really favors you.

11

would be certainly some questions of -- of adequacy of

12

signature and so on.

13

mail kind of signature requirement, I'm guessing that

14

institutionally it might be of some help to the courts

15

because I'm -- I am assuming that in most cases there

16

wouldn't be any contest.

17

signature, it would go forward.

18

signature, it would wait until it got one.

19

am assuming that, knowing nothing, if I don't know any

20

facts beyond what I know now, that there might be an

21

institutional advantage in a rule that required the -- the

kind of proof that -- that your friend on the other side

23

wants.

QUESTION:

But would you -- would you agree that

7

there can be an institutional consideration in a closed

8

case in deciding what due process does require?

9

MR. MINEAR:

10

Court could weigh, but again --

11

QUESTION:

That certainly is a factor that the

Well, you'd have no problem if we --

12

if we held the way you've asked us to hold.

13

-- that institutional problem would disappear if you put

14

it in the mail and there are prison procedures in place,

15

as there are in every prison, everything is okay.

16
17

QUESTION:

I mean, that

Right?

There wouldn't be any litigation

about that.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. MINEAR:

There wouldn't be any litigation.
Well -- well, no.

No, there isn't,

20

but there are also State prisons that do need to determine

21

what procedures they would follow.

22

are a large number of State prisons that follow the

23

practice that was in place in 1988, namely that certified

24

mail may be signed by the -- by the prison officials, but

25

they may not have recorded signatures with regard to the
49

And my guess is there

1

actual receipt by the inmate.

2

QUESTION:

And you think it's not reasonable for

3

the Government go assume that the State prison procedures

4

are adequate to get mail to State prisoners.

5

think that that's reasonably calculated to get mail to

6

State prisoners.

8

MR. MINEAR:
calculated.

9

You don't

We think it is reasonably

Exactly, yes.

QUESTION:

So, if we held that this is a

10

reasonable -- sending it by mail is a reasonable way to do

11

it, you wouldn't have any more of an institutional

12

problem.

13
14
15

MR. MINEAR:

Well, no, we wouldn't.

At the

same -QUESTION:

But if we -- if we said that because

16

there is a gap between mail delivery to a prison and

17

delivery to a prisoner and, for that reason, there must be

18

some indication of the procedure for getting the mail to

19

the prisoner, then you might have a -- a problem and there

20

might be an institutional advantage in a signature rule.

21

Wouldn't there?

22

MR. MINEAR:

Well -- well, that's correct.

But

23

again, I think that the baseline, the constitutional

24

baseline, here should be that ordinary mail suffices, and

25

it's left to the -50

1

QUESTION:

I don't understand why it's -- it's

intuitively obvious that ordinary mail suffices when we

have a situation here which is different from the

And

10

that's why it doesn't seem obvious to me that merely

11

adopting an ordinary mail rule is appropriate to these

12

circumstances at all.

13

MR. MINEAR:

What am I missing?
Your Honor, I think what -- what

14

you see here is the proceedings below validated the fact

15

that ordinary mail would suffice, the fact that there are

QUESTION:

The proceedings below didn't -- as I

understand it, did not stop with proof that the letter was

21

got it in order to get that mail to the prisoner.

22

that correct?

23

The proceedings below involved an -- an

MR. MINEAR:

Isn't

Well, perhaps the answer to your

24

question, Your Honor, is that this Court can certainly

25

affirm the decision below and say that the procedures
51

1

below were adequate.

2

the Court ought not to foreclose the possibility that

3

ordinary mail would suffice.

4

QUESTION:

It would be our view, though, that

Mr. Minear, are there -- do you know

5

whether there are more prisoners incarcerated in prisons

6

than there are college students living in dormitories to

7

whom the mail is not delivered personally or -- or

8

individuals living in high rise apartment buildings where

9

the mail is -- is sorted downstairs and not delivered by

10
11
12
13

the -- by the postman to their -- to their own room?
MR. MINEAR:

I do not know the answer to that,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

That's a problem for all those

14

people, just as it is for prisoners.

15

whatever institution they're in getting the mail to them.

16

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

They have to rely on

Although I would draw a

17

distinction between the apartment building where

oftentimes the mail is provided -- is sorted by the mail

QUESTION:

The warden could just put it on the

shelf and not even give it to the prisoner and there would

10

MR. MINEAR:

Obviously, if there is -- if there

11

is reason to believe by the party that's sending notice

12

the mail will not -- that ordinary mail will not suffice,

13

then due process may require that additional steps be

14

taken.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Minear, in the -- in the hospital

16

setting, the Government has a claim against someone, knows

17

that person is hospitalized, sends ordinary mail to the

18

hospital for the contract claim, the tort claim, whatever.

19

Is the Government saying that for an individual it is

20

enough that mail is sent to that person care of an

21

institution, no return receipt requested, that will do to

22

satisfy due process notice requirements?

23

MR. MINEAR:

Your Honor, I think that it would

24

for this reason, that if a return address is provided and

25

the mail is not delivered by the hospital, we can expect
53

the hospital to send the mail return it to sender.

learning that, the Government may be on an -- under an

obligation at that point --

Court's framework, this Court's test for assessing the
