Liberties Union.

Mr. Olson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

GENERAL OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
All three branches of our National Government

12

have repeatedly determined that pornography causes

13

substantial, incalculable damage to our children, that

14

assisting parents in protecting children from that damage

15

is a compelling national interest, and that pornography is

16

widely available and readily accessible to our children on

17

the Internet.

18

The Child Online Protection Act is Congress'

19

response to that urgent national problem.

20

after testimony, hearings, and findings in direct response

21

to explicit and detailed guidance in this Court's 1993

22

Reno v. ACLU decision explaining how to solve the problem

23

of Internet pornography in a constitutional manner.

24
25

It was drafted

COPA directly responds to several of the Court's
explicit suggestions in its 1997 Reno v. ACLU decision.

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

In the first place, Congress gave explicit, substantive

2

meaning to the terms, harmful to minor, utilizing

3

standards developed over several decades by this Court

4

describing what would be prohibited in the terms used by

5

this Court in the context of minors.

6

the specifics of that, because those are before the Court,

7

and the Court is quite familiar with them.
The Court also added, however, in response to

8
9

I will not get into

this Court's explicit suggestion, the third prong of the

10

so-called Ginsberg-Miller test, that the material taken as

11

a whole would have to lack serious literary, artistic,

12

political, or scientific value for minors, an objective

13

standard developed by this Court to protect the producers

14

of communications.

15

commercial pornographers at this Court's suggestion, those

16

whose trade or business, in an effort to produce profits,

17

are engaged regularly in the production of explicit sexual

18

material for profit.
QUESTION:

19

Congress limited the statute to

In your view, is the provision that

20

it has to be objectionable to minors, is that a national

21

standard?

22

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, as -- the reference to

23

community standards in the statute is in the first and

24

second and prongs of a three-part test.

25

introduced that community standard provision to protect

This Court has

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the communicator from individualized determinations by

2

jurors, and from particularly sensitive, or particularly

3

insensitive communities.

4

The Court has explained again and again that it

5

is an average standard.

It is an adult approach to what

6

might be prohibited from the standpoint of damage to

7

minors.

8

it doesn't refer to any specific geographic limitation.

9

In fact, in the Hamling case and in the Jenkins case

The Court has repeatedly said that it might be --

10

decided by this Court several years ago, the Court made it

11

clear that the community standards prong does not have to

12

apply to any specific community.

13

QUESTION:

But Mr. Olson, isn't the problem with

14

that argument that the definition also refers to the

15

average person, so it's working average in by a separate

16

provision.

17

doesn't the reference to community have to mean something

18

geographical if it's going to mean anything at all?

19

If that is where the average comes in, then

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, this Court has repeatedly

20

said -- for example, in the Hamling case the Court was

21

looking at a geographic standard that covered the entire

22

State of California.

23

Jenkins that the standard doesn't have to have any

24

specific geographic limitation.

25

QUESTION:

The Court said in Hamling and

But did it -- did that -- and I just

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

don't remember this.

2

that separately referred to kind of an average person

3

standard?

4

say, well, it's -- what it's trying to get at is a norm,

5

it's already built the norm in on a different textual

6

basis, and therefore if it's already built that into the

7

definition, and it then additionally speaks of community

8

standard, then that's where I have the problem, so in the

9

case that you refer to, was the definition the same?

10
11

Were we dealing there with a statute

Because the problem that I have here is, if you

Did

it have the two prongs?
GENERAL OLSON:

Well, yes, because the Court was

12

in that case applying the two -- the other two prongs that

13

this Court --

14
15
16

QUESTION:

No, no, but I mean, did it have the

average person provision in the definition?
GENERAL OLSON:

17

the statute itself.

18

QUESTION:

It wasn't in the definition in

It was what this Court read into -Okay.

Well, now we've got it in the

19

statute itself, so in effect I guess you're saying the

20

reference to community standard, or the reference to

21

average, one or the other, is essentially redundant in the

22

definition.

23

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, it may be, but what the

24

Congress was attempting to do was to develop and put into

25

the statute the protections which this Court over the

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

years have said are very important to protect the

2

communicator.
QUESTION:

3
4

You're saying it's a belt and

suspenders definition.
GENERAL OLSON:

5

Well, what this Court has

6

decided is that something to prevent jurors from

7

deciding -- imposing their own individual standards, or

8

imposing the least sensitive standards of the community,

9

or the most sensitive standards of the community.
QUESTION:

10

General Olson, there's one thing that

11

you -- some new thing comes up in your brief.

12

Miller, where there was a geographical base, and I know

13

you said that the Internet is not geographical base, but

14

you use a term that, what is harmful to minors is

15

reasonably constant across the United States.

16

that reasonably constant something looser than, say, the

17

serious value as a limitation on what would qualify as

18

harmful to minors?
GENERAL OLSON:

19

We go from

Now, is

Well, there is two parts to

20

that.

The serious value standard is an objective standard

21

that this Court and other courts are entitled to examine

22

closely, and have examined closely to make sure that there

23

aren't any aberrational prosecutions or limits imposed.

24

With respect to the community standards, what

25

the Congress was attempting to do was to make sure that

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

people didn't impose individual limitations with respect

2

to how they were judging the material with respect to the

3

other two prongs of the statute.

4

your question, but --

5

QUESTION:

I hope I have answered

Well, the words that I used, they

6

invoke Miller, so it sounds like Congress didn't write any

7

word formula that was any different, but you say

8

something -- it's not --

9

GENERAL OLSON:

That was a finding, so to speak,

10

by the House committee that there is not with respect --

11

years have changed since the Miller and the Hamling case.

12

We're now in an era of national television, national

13

media -- some of those standards were articulated at a

14

time when the community of the United States was much more

15

isolated and insular in various different parts.

16

now talking about a national media, national television,

17

national communication, the Internet reaching millions and

18

millions of households.

19

We are

What Congress felt, that there would not be

20

substantial variation between what the average adult would

21

feel would be harmful to minors under the very specific,

22

itemized, detailed standards, prong 1, prong 2, and then

23

with the value-added prong 3 --

24
25

QUESTION:

What was the basis for thinking that

the harmful to minors would be reasonably constant to a

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

greater extent than what is obscene?
GENERAL OLSON:

2

Well, the House report that

3

specifically talked about that did not explain. I should

4

hasten to -- did not explain what the individual elected

5

Members of Congress were thinking when they came to those

6

conclusions.

7

is that Members of Congress are reflecting the judgments

8

that they develop as a result of running for office and

9

being in a national legislature.

I think it's a reasonable thing to conclude,

That's exactly what we expect Congress to do,

10
11

and what Congress did in this case was apply those

12

standards, and those instincts, and those judgments in a

13

way in which it was in every conscientious way attempting

14

to comply with the instruction that came from this Court

15

in Reno v. ACLU as to how to do it.
QUESTION:

16

Well, I think it's a difficult

17

question.

18

you have a trial in State A, say a western State,

19

California, can you bring in an expert from New York and

20

from five other States, experts to tell the jury what the

21

community standard is there, or does the trial judge rule

22

that irrelevant?

23

I don't know what the rule ought to be, but if

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, the courts have permitted

24

expert testimony with respect to that, but there's a great

25

deal of supervision that the trial courts and the

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

appellate courts impose with respect to that to make sure

2

that these definitions are being applied in a

3

nonaberrational --

4

QUESTION:

In your view, how does it work?

I

5

have a California jury.

Is it proper, or is it necessary

6

for that jury to consider what the standards are in other

7

parts of the country before it returns its verdict?

8

GENERAL OLSON:

I would submit, Justice Kennedy,

9

that yes, that would be possible.

The Hamling instruction

10

I think is instructive.

The Hamling instruction was the

11

standards generally held throughout this country

12

concerning sex, and matters pertaining to sex, the average

13

conscience of the time, the present critical point in the

14

compromise between candor and shame at which the community

15

may have arrived at here and now.
In other words, that standard -- and the

16
17

defendant in that case argued to this Court that that is a

18

national standard which this Court in Miller said was not

19

required as a matter of the First Amendment.
Interestingly, in Hamling, the defendants in

20
21

that case argued just as the plaintiffs in this case do,

22

that a national standard is both required and would be

23

prohibited.

24

ways.

25

In other words, they want to have it both

QUESTION:

They want to have it neither way.

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

GENERAL OLSON:

They want to have it neither

2

way.

Either way, it would be unconstitutional, and this

3

Court has specifically addressed that by saying that it --

4

that jurors are allowed to draw from their experience,

5

which necessarily comes from the community in which they

6

reside, but that Congress felt in this case that there

7

would be relatively constant standards throughout the

8

country.

This is a facial challenge.
QUESTION:

9

Well, when you say relative --

10

GENERAL OLSON:

11

QUESTION:

There's no evidence --

You say relatively.

I'd like you to

12

be specific.

13

said, when it says the words, average person applying

14

contemporary community standards, we instruct the jury

15

that the word community means the United States taken as a

16

whole?

17

That is, would it satisfy you if this Court

GENERAL OLSON:

I think that this Court has said

18

that that is not a requirement of the First Amendment, but

19

from the --

20
21

QUESTION:

I know.

I'm not saying it's a

requirement --

22

GENERAL OLSON:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

-- of the First Amendment.

Suppose,

24

having read the legislative history, I came to the

25

conclusion that that, in light of all the constitutional

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

difficulties, is just what Congress had in mind, and

2

therefore I wrote in the opinion, community means the

3

entire audience at which this is aimed, likely the entire

4

United States.

5

GENERAL OLSON:

6

QUESTION:

7

Now, if those words were in the

opinion, would you consider that you had won this case?
GENERAL OLSON:

8
9

I --

I think I would, Justice Breyer,

and I think --

10

QUESTION:

So that satisfies you.

11

GENERAL OLSON:

And I think that would be a --

12

the statute is readily -- to use the words of this Court,

13

the statute is readily susceptible to the narrowing

14

construction, if that's how you would regard that, or a

15

leveling construction.
QUESTION:

16

I --

Now, would you tell me what the

17

difference is between the construction that Justice Breyer

18

has suggested and the result of your argument that the

19

third prong, the value prong, is in fact an objective

20

prong and hence a national -- I assume it's a national

21

standard.

22

effect eliminates -- as I understand your argument, the

23

application of that prong eliminates a lot of the

24

idiosyncracy that might conceivably come in under a strict

25

geographic standard.

It's an objective prong, and therefore that in

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Is there a difference between the construction

2

Justice Breyer is suggesting and the result that we would

3

get if we accepted your argument about the effect of the

4

third prong?

5

GENERAL OLSON:

I don't think so.

I think that

6

what Justice Breyer is suggesting is a jury instruction or

7

a judicial construction which would apply to prongs 1 and

8

2, and that what you're saying is absolutely correct also,

9

we submit, that that is precisely what this Court has said

10
11
12
13
14

that third prong is there for.
QUESTION:

I should --

Oh, I wasn't necessarily saying it.

I was saying that I think you're saying it.
GENERAL OLSON:

Well then, I agree with your

construction of what I'm saying.

15

QUESTION:

Of you, okay.

16

(Laughter.)

17

GENERAL OLSON:

I think it's a very important

18

point to make, that the Court has said that that is

19

another way in which we protect the speaker from

20

aberrational, highly --

21

QUESTION:

Well, but aren't you then saying to

22

us that Congress, when it used the word community, really

23

meant to say national?

24

QUESTION:

Yes.

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, I suspect, Justice

2

Stevens, that the people who assisted the Members of

3

Congress in drafting the statute read this Court's

4

decisions, as there's every indication in the two

5

committee reports and in the hearings that were taken,

6

that the Court was attempting in every way to live up to

7

the standards of this Court.

8

the First Amendment does not require a national standard

9

with respect to community standards, but this Court has

10

not been entirely -QUESTION:

11
12

This Court was saying that

I think you're answering my question

by saying yes.
GENERAL OLSON:

13

Well, what I think -- no, I

14

don't necessarily think that the Court -- that the

15

Congress was intending to impose a national standard,

16

because this Court had said that it wasn't required under

17

the First Amendment, and that the community standards did

18

not have to be judged by any particular geographical area.
QUESTION:

19

I'm not trying to find out what the

20

Constitution requires or what our cases might have

21

required.

22

community means, as used in this section of the statute.

23

I'm just asking you what you think the word

GENERAL OLSON:

Well, I think what Congress was

24

attempting to do was come as close as possible to adopting

25

what this Court had said in the context of obscenity.

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Now, I should hasten to say that to the extent

2

that the Third Circuit felt that the community standards

3

makes it unconstitutional in the context of the Internet,

4

that -- those community standards are -- this statute

5

prohibits obscene material on the Internet, too, and

6

community standards don't work for material which is

7

harmful to minors.

8

obscenity, either.

They don't work probably for

9

QUESTION:

I don't know where we are here --

10

QUESTION:

Do you think it's possible for a

11

North Carolina jury to sit in judgment of a particular

12

pornographic transmission and decide whether this would

13

offend the standards of Las Vegas and New York City?

14

mean, doesn't any jury necessarily apply the standards of

15

its own community?

16

imaginary distinction here?

I

Aren't we really talking about an

17

GENERAL OLSON:

18

QUESTION:

Well, yes, Justice --

Let's assume that you instruct the

19

jury, jury, you must apply a national standard.

20

someone who's been raised his whole life in North Carolina

21

know about Las Vegas?

22

GENERAL OLSON:

What does

Well, I would submit that the

23

judge would instruct the jury, and the judge examining the

24

decision of the jury afterwards in appellate courts would

25

do exactly what this Court has said.

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

As long as the juror is attempting to apply his

2

judgment or her judgment with respect to adult

3

perceptions, based upon all the input that the juror may

4

have with respect to what is generally harmful to

5

minors -- the dilemma that this has caused, causes here,

6

both for Congress and here in this Court, is that we want

7

on the one hand to make sure that idiosyncratic judgments

8

are not being imposed on the transmitter of information.

9

On the other hand, we don't want such wide variations that

10
11

there would be difference in community -QUESTION:

I suppose a defendant could call an

12

expert witness in the case in North Carolina and say that

13

in New York this is fine.

14

a North Carolina jury would pay to that.

15

GENERAL OLSON:

I don't know how much attention

I think the defendants can put

16

on expert testimony with respect to what general standards

17

are, to use the phrase in Hamling, country-wide.

18

should say --

19

QUESTION:

Now, I

But then the trial judge must

20

instruct the jury, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this

21

is a national standard, and that's consistent with what

22

Justice Breyer suggested to you, that we might consider in

23

putting in the opinion, so it's a national standard.

24

GENERAL OLSON:

I'm not objecting to that.

25

that is the readily accessible --

QUESTION:

I think we're asking what the

Court -- which the Congress wanted.

this Court's decisions mean, but we need to know how it

ought to apply to this case in the context of the

11

Now, I can sympathize

The Internet would be very different than a

GENERAL OLSON:

I think that is a reasonable

solution to the problem, and is consistent with what
Congress was saying.
Congress was also aware that this Court has said

12

over and over again that the same material may be judged

13

differently by different juries from place to place, and

14

that that is not a constitutional impediment.

15

has also said --

QUESTION:

This Court

General Olson, in this context, if

17

you could -- I didn't get a clear answer to my question.

18

Maybe I'll put it this way.

19

control, either by the trial judge or the appellate judge,

20

with respect to the serious value standard than there is

21

with respect to the national standard for community --

22

GENERAL OLSON:

Is there greater judicial

Yes.

That's what this Court has

23

said again and again, and we of course accept that, and

24

that is -- Congress accepted that as well.

25

QUESTION:

And is your point, then, we first

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

take out that category.

2

GENERAL OLSON:

3

QUESTION:

If it's serious value, it's out.
Yes.

And it's only when it doesn't have

4

serious value, then you get into the question of

5

national --

6

GENERAL OLSON:

Yes, that's right, but remember

7

that -- it seems important to emphasize that these

8

definitions are highly specific with respect to the

9

material which is prohibited.

It's not just saying to

10

jurors -- the obscenity statute doesn't have any of these

11

limitations in it.

12

18 U.S.C. 466 just talks in very, very general

13

terms, so what Congress was trying to do here is be much

14

more specific than the obscenity statute, which this Court

15

has accepted for 30 or 40 years by importing these kinds

16

of definitions into it.

17

responsively was not only defining what was prohibited

18

very specifically, but then incorporating those specific

19

standards, just as you suggest, Justice Ginsburg.

20

What Congress felt it was doing

The other thing that this Court has said is that

21

those who are choosing a medium to make available to

22

children material which is harmful to children, over which

23

the person who is disseminating that information, those

24

who wantonly decide to pollute the stream from which we

25

all drink have a responsibility to take the minimal steps

18

1

necessary to reduce the harm that's being caused by

2

putting that material into the stream.

3

What we have as a result of this are substantive

4

standards that Congress developed based upon the teachings

5

of this Court with respect to obscenity, applying those

6

standards to minors, as this Court suggested is

7

appropriate and a part of a compelling national interest

8

in the Ginsberg case, the Ferber case, and Sable case, and

9

other cases where the Court has suggested that something

10

has to be done, and is entirely appropriate to be done

11

with respect to minors.

12

And then the third thing that Congress did was

13

adopt a solution to the problem which is consistent with

14

what 48 or so States have in these blinder laws, magazine

15

racks displays, the books, materials that this Court

16

considered in the American Booksellers case with respect

17

to what would be permissible to prevent children from

18

seeing damaging materials in bookstores.

19

Now, that is -- so what we have as a result of

20

COPA, Congress listening to this Court, lowering the age

21

to 16 and under, making it apply to commercial speech and

22

noncommercial speech, returning parental control, adopting

23

a device that this Court has considered in the Sable case

24

and considered in this case.

25

decision in Reno v. ACLU said that the age verification

system is technologically and economically feasible, is

2

already in use, and would provide a defense to those

3

commercial purveyors of pornography, so Congress listened

4

to that, adopted that system, put into place for the

GENERAL OLSON:

11

QUESTION:

12

GENERAL OLSON:

Well --

-- in Congress' mind?
Well, I think -- and the Court

13

considered a case earlier this year of the damage that

14

that industry does, earlier this term.

15

parts to that, Justice Scalia, the damage of the industry,

16

the domestic industry itself is incalculable, but the

17

damage to the recipient, to the children, are also

18

incalculable, so that might address part of the problem,

19

but Congress in this --

20

QUESTION:

Yes, there's two

But here, at least from the exhibits

21

that you gave us, it doesn't seem that this material --

there are no virtual children, no real children.

GENERAL OLSON:

This is

Yes. We're not talking about

that aspect of the issue that you're considering in that

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

other case, but what I was simply trying to address is

2

Justice Scalia's question, that this is a major problem.

3

We understand from the legislative history that explicit,

4

adult material, not just on the Internet, is an $8 billion

5

industry.

6

case, there are 28,000 sexually explicit commercial

7

pornography sites on the Internet.
This is readily accessible to children.

8
9

According to what Congress decided in this

It is

almost -- anyone with any experience with the Internet

10

will tell you that children can find it readily, and find

11

it as long as they can type and read they will find it,

12

and will find it by accident, and once they find it by

13

accident -- the House committee points out that if you

14

type in the words, White House, www.whitehouse.com, you

15

will find offensive, explicit pornography, and it's very

16

hard to get rid of.

17

QUESTION:

And much of it you say -- if I

18

understand you correctly, you -- this law doesn't touch --

I'd like to reserve the remaining part of my

striking down or not allowing the enforcement of a statute

MS. BEESON:

exhibits are not pictures at all.

by definition protected for adults.

MS. BEESON:

I'm saying -- perhaps in even most

communities that believe that providing any information

19

about experiencing sexual pleasure, about sex toys, to

20

teenagers, is sinful and is definitely harmful, and --

21

QUESTION:

That's probably so, but I mean, what

22

Justice Breyer is addressing and what I was concerned with

23

with Mr. Olson was his argument that the third prong, the

24

value prong, in effect, sort of sands off the rough edges,

25

and it gets the -- in practical terms it gets the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

community peculiarity out of it, and is that -- obviously

2

you don't agree with it.
MS. BEESON:

3

Why is he wrong in that?

Your Honor, first of all, I think

4

because all of the millions of speakers, including our

5

clients on the web, they are the ones that have to

6

understand this law, and as Mitch Pepper, who runs a

7

Sexual Health Network which provides specific information

8

about how to experience sexual pleasure to disabled

9

persons, testified, I think very strongly, based on my

10

interpretation of the words in this statute, even with the

11

serious value prong, that value prong is value for minors,

12

and he has to believe, as he testified, that discussion of

13

masturbation, oral sex, anal sex, descriptive positioning,

14

all of that can be construed as pandering to the prurient

15

interest of minors.
Those are the -- these are the speakers who are

16
17

going to be subjected to criminal prosecution under this

18

law, and let me clear, our clients don't ever want to come

19

before a jury.

That's the problem, of course.

reasons which I want to explain.

is clear, and that is because of the very strong deterrent

10

That was true in Hamling, too.

There

11

was considerable deterrence, just because you didn't

know -- if you sent stuff Nation-wide, you didn't know

where you might be prosecuted.

14

MS. BEESON:

Mr. Chief Justice, there's a very

15

real distinction here, and that is that Hamling was about

16

the obscenity standard and this is about the harmful-to-

17

minors standard, and my point is that -QUESTION:

18

Just a minute.

19

you think that's a distinction?

20

MS. BEESON:

Will you explain why

Because by definition all of the

21

material targeted by the statute is protected speech for

22

adults.

children don't.

adults don't have the right to access the material.

25

Adults have the right to access it, even though

people in Hamling ran the same risk.

2

thought their stuff would not be found to be subject to

3

the community standard, but a jury might find otherwise,

4

so that's just what you're complaining about.

5

MS. BEESON:

They may have

Well, the range of speech, however,

6

of course, protected speech that is limited by the -- by

any harmful-to-minors display statute.

8

9

speech is protected for adults.

10
11

It's just by

It's not like you're just

arguing about the margin of what is obscene for everyone.
QUESTION:

Well, in obscenity cases, whether it

12

was obscenity or not depended upon the community

13

standards, so you were really taking your chance when you

14

published something nationally you were subject to the

15

least -- highest common denominator of obscenity.

16

should it be any different for pornography than it is with

17

obscenity?

18

cases establish that it is no violation of the First

19

Amendment to subject a publisher to differing standards

20

throughout the country.

Third Circuit explicitly affirmed the findings of fact by

QUESTION:

I'm trying to get you to ask --

2

answer one specific question, and I'll try once more, all

3

right.

4

The question in front of us, presented is

5

whether the court of appeals properly barred enforcement

6

on First Amendment grounds because the statute relies on

7

community standards to identify material that is harmful

8

to minors.

9

reasons why this statute is unconstitutional.

That's the question before us.

You have 17
I'd like

10

you, for the purpose of this question, to forget about

11

those 17 reasons.

12

one reason, that the community standards -- that's what's

13

in the question -- if we were to say the word community

14

means national, then would you concede -- would you say

15

you've won, or you've lost, or --

I want to know if, in respect to this

16

MS. BEESON:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Yes.
That -- how does that affect the

case, to answer that question nationally?
MS. BEESON:

Yes, and our answer is that even

20

under a national standard this law clearly violates the

21

First Amendment.

22

QUESTION:

I know that, but is the right thing

23

to do, then, for us to say, court of appeals, you were

24

wrong about the meaning of the word, community standards.

25

It is a national standard.

There may be other things

1

wrong with this statute, in which case, go and consider

2

them, but this isn't one of them.

3

MS. BEESON:

Your Honor, we -- again, if that

were the course that you decided to take, we do not think

5

that the appropriate thing would be to vacate the

6

injunction, but whether to leave the injunction in place,

7

and then --

8

10
11

QUESTION:

Not vacating the injunction, vacate

the order of the court of appeals and say, you consider
these other points.
MS. BEESON:

Again, Your Honor, I don't think

12

that that would be a helpful or useful exercise in this

13

case, because of both the strong facts we're working on

14

and also just to talk about the problem of the national

15

standard which, of course, was referred to when Mr. Olson

16

was speaking.

17

You know, as the Court said in Miller, a

18

national standard would be an exercise in futility.

19

jurors have to decide base on their own sense of community

20

standards whether or not something is patently offensive

3

chance on whether what you publish is pornographic and

4

harmful to minors.

5

between the two?

6

Why should there be any difference

MS. BEESON:

Well, for one reason of course, one

7

of the crucial distinctions here is the nature of the

8

Internet, and that is one of the arguments that the Third

9

Circuit discussed.

It is very distinct from handling in

10

Sable in the sense that this is not a situation where

11

people who put their speech up on the web have any way of

12

limiting their speech to only certain communities.

13

QUESTION:

But you're only talking about

14

commercial speech, something that people are going to have

15

to pay to see.

16

MS. BEESON:

Justice O'Connor, the Congress very

17

explicitly wrote the definition of commercial speech in

18

this statute so broadly that it applies to much more than

19

people who primarily communicate what is termed commercial

20

pornography.

21

That was the point before.

They explicitly said

22

that anyone who includes any material that is harmful to

minors is covered by the law, and again, according to the

You would say we could not allow community standards to be

24

applied --

QUESTION:

2

MS. BEESON:

-- on the web, for obscenity.
We think that that is a very

3

different question, and that is not a necessary conclusion

4

for the reason that I said before and that is because, by

5

definition, a national standard for what is displayed as

6

harmful to minors on the web would impact far more

7

protected speech than a national standard for obscenity,

8

which is by definition unprotected for adults as well as

9

minors, and to put it another way, no adult has the right

10

to materials that are obscene in even the most tolerant

11

community.

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. BEESON:

14
15

It seems -All adults have the right to

materials.
QUESTION:

-- the issue is how

16

unconstitutionally unfair it is to the publisher,

17

regardless of how many publishers are covered.

18

saying it's okay to do this for obscenity but somehow not

19

for pornography.

20

risk Nation-wide is an unconstitutional thing, you're

21

going to go to jail just the same, whether you're going to

22

jail for pornography or obscenity.

It seems to me if subjecting you to a

23

MS. BEESON:

24

QUESTION:

25

You're

We are saying -If we cannot use community standards

for this, I don't see why we can use it for obscenity.

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. BEESON:

We, of course, don't think you need

2

to even reach that question, but to the extent that you

3

do, again, I think that it is quite a different question

4

because of the amount of protected speech that is

5

impacted.

6

under -- with obscenity a national standard would be

7

nearly as problematic as it would when you're talking

8

about making available materials which are clearly, by

9

definition, protected for adults to receive.

10

It's just not -- it is not so clear that

What COPA does is to prevent speakers from doing

11

that, and requires them to make this unwelcome choice,

12

which is, you either set up costly screens that the record

13

shows are going to drive away your users, or you self-

14

sensor, and if you're a Different Light Bookstore, or you

15

are the Sexual Health Network, or you're the artnet, a

16

fine art vendor, it's only rational, and of course they

17

testified to this, you are going to self-censure, because

18

that was the only option that will ensure that you're not

19

prosecuted.

20

QUESTION:

But what about the Government's

21

position that of all the exhibits that are at least in the

22

record presented to us, there's only three that they say,

23

even as a matter of law, might be subject to prosecution,

24

so they're giving you a clean bill of health on all these

25

others, and they say it's really a very narrow category,

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

not the broad category that you're describing.
MS. BEESON:

2

Justice Ginsburg, in fact that

3

concession in the reply brief makes us more nervous than

4

ever, and that is because the Government has changed their

5

mind.

6

our clients, none of our clients even had standing to

7

raise the constitutionality of this action because they

8

were so clearly protected.

9

They very clearly argued at the district court that

Now, suddenly, here we are before the Supreme

10

Court, and they say, oh, no, we changed our minds, some of

11

them can be prosecuted.

12

could change their mind again in the future --

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. BEESON:

That very much implies that they

Ms. Beeson --- and in fact the speech is

15

indistinguishable from many other exhibits that are in the

16

joint appendix before you.

17

QUESTION:

Ms. Beeson, let's talk about artnet.

18

Do you really think that when artnet puts out the Andre

19

Serano photographs, do you think it expects to avoid being

20

held under this statute because of 6(a), that it would

21

hope that the average person applying contemporary

22

community standards would find this material as a whole

23

not designed to appeal to or pander to the prurient

24

interest, or do you rather think that artnet's protection

25

would surely be sought under (c), namely, that the

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

material taken as a whole possesses serious literary,

2

artistic, political, or scientific value?

3

their real protection?

4

MS. BEESON:

Isn't that

Your Honor, they really do not

5

believe it is their protection, and that again is because

6

it says, serious value for minors, and that, of course, is

7

one of the primary distinctions between this category and

8

obscenity.

9

fine art --

10

There are many people who would think that the

QUESTION:

The national standard -- I guess I

11

have to go back to that, but I didn't get an answer.

12

Right now, your clients could worry that they would be

13

prosecuted under the Miller standard, and the only

14

difference is minors, and so I find it very hard to think

15

of an artistic work that one would say has serious value

16

to a 21-year-old but not to a 16-year-old.

17

seems impossible.

That, to me,

18

Now, you give me an example of such a thing.

19

MS. BEESON:

Well, Your Honor, the Government

20

itself is saying that art --

21

QUESTION:

22
23
24
25

That's their opinion.

I'm asking for

your opinion.
MS. BEESON:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, but they're

the ones that are going to prosecute my clients.
QUESTION:

That may be, but the very fact that

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

your clients could be prosecuted does not mean they win

2

this case, because after all, they might be prosecuted

3

under Miller, too, and everyone agrees that that's the

4

law, so I'm asking you for your opinion, if you can find

5

an example of a work of art that would have serious value

6

for a 21-year-old but not for a minor, and I'm telling you

7

I can't think of one, and the reason that I ask you is,

8

I'd like you to try to think of one.

9

MS. BEESON:

Your Honor, with respect, we

10

believe that all of the exhibits that we have put in, the

11

artistic ones and the literary works, the column, the nude

12

artworks by several clients, all of these could be

13

targeted under the statute, and again, what the effect,

14

the First Amendment effect of the statute is whether or

15

not our clients legitimately feel like they have to self-

16

censure under this law as compared to the obscenity law.

17

They don't believe that their works are obscene.

18

They know that some communities will find them harmful to

19

minors, and for that reason what they are going to do is,

20

they're going to self-censure, and what it's going to

21

effectively do is have COPA driving a certain category of

22

speech protected for adults from the marketplace of ideas

23

that is the web.

24
25

QUESTION:

Are you saying that you have to give

some effect to Congress' words?

It didn't say serious

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

value, period.

2

from serious value that we're accustomed to dealing with

3

in the obscenity area, so for the Court to say, well,

4

Congress just used those words, they didn't mean anything.

5

That's I suppose what you're saying is of concern.

6

It said, to minors, and that's different

MS. BEESON:

Yes, Your Honor, and the history of

7

the harmful-to-minors definition, that is one of the

8

primary points.

9

might think that artistic words that are explicit, and you

The point is that even though people

10

know, references to homosexuality that are explicit, have

11

value for adults, many, if not most communities find that

12

that same material does not have value for minors.

13

And again, to address your question, too,

14

Justice Breyer, about the 16-year-old or the 17-year-old,

15

there is nothing in this statute that defines minor as the

16

16-year-old.

17

interpretation of that statute.

18

The Government has been, again, pushing an

QUESTION:

But I thought you might -- I mean, I

19

thought that the word, for example, for minors comes out

20

of cases that permit the Government to require certain

21

magazines to be placed in certain places in the

22

bookstores, or in the retail shops, with brown covers, so

23

perhaps there's some experience, since we have worked with

24

the words, for minors, of something that has to be done

25

under that law, but doesn't fall within Miller.

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

I mean, I just wanted to get your views on it.

2

MS. BEESON:

Yes, absolutely. I think there

3

haven't been that many cases on the books because, again,

4

those statutes are much easier to comply with, and that's

5

what the courts have found, but even in those cases the

6

court has looked very carefully at whether or not there

7

was a significant deterrence effect on adults, and in the

8

blinder rack cases, none of which dealt with the unique

9

nature of the online medium, in which, as our records

10

showed, up to 75 percent of users would be deterred from

11

accessing speech that had a screen in front of it.

12

that is the finding of the district court.

13

Now,

The blinder rack cases didn't deal with that

14

kind of situation.

15

disclose their identity, or to register before obtaining

16

the access to protected speech, and there is certainly no

17

record of the strong deterrence, and importantly, in those

18

cases there was no record of an equally effective

19

alternative, and that is something that I really think we

20

need to get to, because here the district court

21

specifically found that there was an alternative that was

22

equally effective, and that is the use of blocking

23

software, user-based blocking programs, and in fact --

24
25

QUESTION:

None of them would require adults to

But you're saying that it -- you're

saying, which was an issue last time around, it's up to

2

take it, is something that the parent would buy and

3

install.

4

anything, and I think your answer is no.

The question is whether Government can do

MS. BEESON:

5

The blocking, I

Your Honor, we believe that

6

Congress did two things already that we're not challenging

7

here.

8

look into other options for protecting children, and after

9

the statute was enacted, that same study commission,

First of all, it established a study commission to

10

Congress -- and so I don't think, with respect to Mr.

11

Olson, that he's correct that all three branches of

12

Government are on the same wavelength here.

13

we have some difference, and that is, Congress' own

14

commission has now concluded also, which is equal to the

15

district court's findings, that user-based blocking

16

software is actually more effective than credit card and

17

adult access code screening.

18

I think that

Just to remind the Court also that the Court

19

specifically found that the Government didn't prove the

20

last time around, in Reno v. ACLU, that those screening

21

techniques, credit card and adult access codes, will

22

actually prevent minors from accessing the content.

23

same is true here.

24

actually effective, whereas the district court

25

specifically found user-based alternatives are effective,

The

There's no evidence that those are

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and then Congress' own commission concluded the same

2

thing.
QUESTION:

3

Well, of course, all this goes to

4

these other aspects of the statute.

As I understand where

5

we are in the argument, the court of appeals decided for

6

reasons that I think we cannot criticize on this record

7

that it's going to sustain this injunction based on the

8

community standards problem, and we're asking you, if the

9

community standard is national, doesn't that solve that

10

problem, and I'm coming away from this argument with the

11

impression that you're saying, well, I'm not going to

12

bother to help you on that, because there are so many

13

other things in the statute I want to talk about.

14

MS. BEESON:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Yes, I'm sorry.
But that doesn't help me answer this

question.
MS. BEESON:

Right, and I don't mean to leave

18

that impression.

I -- what I'm saying clearly is that we

19

believe that even if you were to read a national standard,

20

it would be unconstitutional, because the real effect

21

would be precisely the same as the local community

22

standards interpretation is, and that is, the least

23

tolerant community would get to set the standards for

24

everyone on the web, since web speakers have no way to

25

determine where their audience is.

43
Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

But is it not true that --

2

QUESTION:

Then you're saying that a national

3
4

standard can't be enforced with any jury.
MS. BEESON:

I don't think that it can, because

5

again jurors are going to have to enforce that.

6

going to have to have still a jury decide what is patently

7

offensive and prurient, and I think they're going to do

8

that naturally based on where they're physically located,

9

in their own community.

10

QUESTION:

Then you're -- and I don't mean this

11

dismissively, but I think we have to accept this.

12

saying there in fact is no way to regulate this.

13

MS. BEESON:

You're

You're

Your Honor, I'm saying that there

14

isn't any way to make it a crime to display material

15

harmful to minors on the web.

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. BEESON:

Yes.
That is our position, and again,

18

that we believe is very consistent with many other

19

statutes that have recently been struck down by the Court.

20

Just last term in the Playboy case, in, you know,

21

obviously the Reno v. ACLU case, the Denver Area case, I

22

mean, in the last 20 years I count at least six statutes,

23

some of which weren't even criminal statutes like this

24

one, which I think has an even stronger potential for

25

chilling speech, that were struck down because of the

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

burden on adult speech.
QUESTION:

No, but I'm not -- again, I'm not

3

asking you the global question.

4

MS. BEESON:

5

QUESTION:

I understand.
I'm just asking you the question that

6

goes to the specific issue that we took for review, and

7

that is the legitimacy of basing an injunction, or

8

sustaining the district court's injunction on the

9

community standards portion of the statute, and my

10

question to you is simply, I take it you're saying that

11

there is no way to write a standard into the statute, call

12

it community, call it national, call it some third thing

13

that you dream up, that will ever suffice

14

constitutionally.

15

Forgetting the rest of the statute, forgetting

16

the rest of the problem, just on the touchstone of the

17

standard, there's no way to do it, and I think your answer

18

is no, there is no way to do it.

19

MS. BEESON:

There is no way to do it, and

20

again, I do want to be clear that I think that we can

21

divorce the rest of the language of the statute, even

22

aside from the deterrence issues, and what I mean by that

23

is, because the statute was written so broadly as to cover

24

anybody who had even just one image, for example, because

25

the statute was written to include not just images but

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

text, I think, you know, I think those problems still

2

remain even just looking at the textual language, even if

3

you're focusing just on the community standard versus the

4

national standard, and that's another reason why we don't

5

think that fixing that problem is enough to save the

6

statute.
QUESTION:

7

May I ask another sort of general

8

question?

Do you think there's any way in which Congress

9

can deal with the problem of what they call teasers, which

10

everyone would agree would violate the standard here, and

11

would also not have serious artistic value?

12

MS. BEESON:

Your Honor, one way they could do

13

that, of course, is through more vigorous prosecution of

14

obscenity and child pornography, which again --

15

QUESTION:

16

MS. BEESON:

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. BEESON:

No, no, I'm assuming nonobscene -Nonobscene.
-- but clearly pornographic teasers.
Well, I mean, I of course don't

19

want to be the one to rewrite the statute, but I do think,

20

as I suggested before, that if they --

21
22
23

QUESTION:

But I'm asking if it's your position

that that's beyond the power of Congress to control.
MS. BEESON:

I think that a statute that did

24

just apply, for example, to web sites who were actually

25

selling things already -- this one isn't limited to

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that -- and secondly, web sites who the predominant

2

portion of their site was actually harmful to minors.

3

That would certainly be closer to just addressing teasers

4

than this statute is.
QUESTION:

5

You still haven't answered my

6

question.

7

Congress to control the teaser problem.
MS. BEESON:

8
9

My question is whether it's beyond the power of

Justice Stevens, my answer is that

I think if they wrote a statute -- are you asking me

10

whether I think that statute would be unconstitutional

11

also, because of course, I have to argue yes, it would be,

12

but it would certainly be -- you don't have to believe me

13

on that.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MS. BEESON:

16

Obviously, and you know, just to be

clear --

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. BEESON:

Just on this one, right?
-- that would be -- that's what I

19

mean.

20

would be one narrowly tailored to the --

21

That's a very different statute than this one.

QUESTION:

It

No, but one of the things we have to

22

be concerned with is, there is a genuine problem that

23

Congress is trying to address, and if your position is you

24

just forget about it, that you've got to live with the

25

problem, that's quite a different position than if you

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

think, well, there's a less restrictive alternative that

2

would accomplish what the Congress is trying to do, and

3

you're suggesting to me there isn't a less restrictive

4

alternative.
MS. BEESON:

5

Well, the less restrictive

6

alternative for actually protecting children is the user-

7

based mechanisms, and that again, the -- Congress itself

8

found to be actually more effective at protecting

9

children.

10

Just to refer to the exhibits that were put in

11

by the Government, every single one of those sites that

12

address the teaser problem, all of those were blocked by

13

all of the major --

What would Congress do, pass a law

15

requiring parents at their own expense to impose user-

16

based screening?

that the Federal Government could -QUESTION:

I mean, that's not a solution.

That

is not a solution within the power of Congress.
MS. BEESON:

No, and we don't think it needs to

be, because we think, of course, the ultimate decision

23

ought to be resting on parents, where it always has, to

24

make a decision as to whether they --

Stevens, in your capacity as a lawyer, that whatever

2

statute Congress came up with, you would believe in that

3

capacity was unconstitutional.

4

that there's any statute that is constitutional.

asking about what you think, not what I think.

6

MS. BEESON:

You're not prepared to say
I'm

We are not prepared to say that any

7

statute which significantly burdens adult speech is

8

constitutional, and I think that is very consistent with

9

the opinions of this Court, as in the Playboy case and the

10

Denver Area case.
In sum, I just want to say that the web provides

11
12

access, as we all know, to more speech by more speakers

13

than any other communications medium in history.

14

threatens to transform this dynamic medium into one that

is fit only for children.

more effectively?

simplify the problem of buying -- of setting up software

MS. BEESON:

I think that it might have some

compelled speech concerns, especially, again, where you're

talking about a medium where you have these individuals --

just because it's commercial businesses doesn't mean

9

there's a big -- you know, a lot of employees to make

10

these determinations.

11

individuals who are working out of their home.

12

they're just not going to be able to do that.

they're much more likely to do instead is to self-censor,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

16

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

17

GENERAL OLSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

18

Justice Ginsburg, this Court has specifically

19

said and held in the Ginsberg case that the Government

20

does have a responsibility, and this Court has repeatedly

21

said there's a compelling national interest in addressing

22

that responsibility.

23

It's an independent, as this Court put it in the Ginsberg

24

case, independent responsibility to do something to

25

prevent damage, which everybody agrees is damage to

It is not just helping the parents.

children.
What we're hearing from the plaintiffs in this

2
3

case is the same sky is falling defense that everything

4

possible is going to be precluded and taken away from

5

adults, and that some of the same parties were making in

6

the American Booksellers case, and this Court sent that

7

back to Virginia and asked the Virginia court to examine

8

whether all of these publications and materials were going

9

to be covered by the statute, and it turned out that none

10

of them were, and then the case wended its way back to the

11

Fourth Circuit, and it resolved itself in these statutes

12

that were used, that Congress uses as an analogy, the

13

blinder statute.
Now, what our opponents say now is that this

14
15

blinder statute applied to the Internet is somehow

16

intrusive, expensive, intolerable, burdensome.

17

you go into a bookstore to look behind the rack, you have

18

to do that in person.

the identity of the person using it.

it's quite obvious that this is less intrusive.

As this

6

Court said in Reno v. ACLU, the system already exists, and

7

it's already in use, so what -- and the definitions -- oh,

8

and the other point that several of the questions have

9

focused on is if community standards are not permissible

10

on the Internet, which is what I understand our opponent's

11

position to be, those go out the window with respect to

12

obscenity, because those are the same standards that this

13

Court developed.
Now, what will happen then, as a result of

14
15

affirming the Third Circuit's decision, is that all of the

16

obscene material which is now behind the screen will be in

17

front of the screen, and all these children will now not

18

just be seeing the teasers, but the effect of the Third

19

Circuit decision is that they will be seeing everything

20

that anybody, any of the commercial pornographers want to

21

put on the Internet.
Now, the definition of commercial, that is the

22

same definition. Congress understands what those words

mean.
