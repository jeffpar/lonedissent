Mr. Ingram.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. INGRAM
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. INGRAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The petitioner in this case is asking the Court

12

to rule that the brandish clause of 18 United States Code,

13

Section 924(c) is an element to be charged and proved

14

beyond a reasonable doubt and not merely a sentencing

15

enhancement, based on two separate and independent bases.

16

The first is the statutory analysis under Jones v. United

17

States, and the second basis is the constitutional

18

analysis under Apprendi v. New Jersey.

19

the Jones argument first.

20

And I will address

The carjacking statute in Jones v. United States

21

had, as additional elements, serious injury and death,

22

which the Court held to be additional elements after the

23

statutory analysis was completed.

24

statute in that case and 18 United States Code, section

25

924(c) in this case are virtually mirror images of each

And the carjacking

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

other structurally and grammatically.

2

The Court looked at the text of the statute, the

3

legislative history behind those facts, and how

4

legislatures historically had treated those facts in

5

determining that serious injury and death were, in fact,

6

elements to be proved and not merely sentencing

7

enhancements.

8
9

Likewise, we contend that brandish, based on the
-- the text of the statute, the -- how legislatures have

10

typically treated that fact and the fact that it involves

11

a mens rea element -- that is, brandish is -- is defined

12

as displaying or making the presence known of a firearm in

13

order to intimidate and -- and mens rea has traditionally

14

been an element -- and then based on the legislative

15

history that those statutes would lead the Court to

16

conclude, based on the statutory analysis, that brandish

17

is in fact an element to be proved and not merely a

18

sentencing enhancement.

19

QUESTION:

But it's not so -- it seems to me

20

that -- I understand your argument, but it's not so clear

21

as it was in Jones.

22

and brandish is -- is a -- is a smaller difference in

23

degree.

24

differences.

25

between 5 and -- and 7, for example.

I mean, the difference between use

The difference in the penalties are smaller
It's just a couple of years, the difference
And -- and I

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

understand how you can make the argument, but I don't see

2

the argument as being sort of a slam dunk in the case.

3

MR. INGRAM:

Your Honor, if I may address each

4

of those concerns.

5

that the increase under the brandish statute goes from a

6

mandatory minimum of 5 to a mandatory minimum of -- of 7

7

not being a steep increase, first of all, it does take the

8

defendant 40 percent higher for brandishing from 5 to 7,

9

and -- and it doubles the penalty 100 percent higher for

The -- first of all, the -- the fact

10

discharging the firearm, which cannot be divorced from the

11

brandishing element.

12

There are cases from this Court in the context

13

of ex post facto challenges to application of sentences

14

that were enacted after the defendant committed the crime,

15

most particularly Miller v. Florida, the leading case

16

which we cite in our brief, where the Court held that an

17

increase in a sentence of anywhere from two to two and a

18

half years substantially disadvantaged the defendant and

19

foreclosed the defendant from asking for a lower sentence.

20

Likewise, in the case of Glover v. United

21

States, which we do not cite in our brief -- that is at

22

531 U.S. 198 -- the Court held, in the context of a

23

challenge of ineffective assistance of counsel, that an

24

additional guideline sentence under the Federal sentencing

25

guidelines of anywhere from 6 to 21 months meets the

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

substantial prejudice prong of the ineffective assistance

2

of counsel claim.

3

to 7 years is in fact a -- a substantial difference.

4

So, we contend that the increase from 5

The elements in question, comparing serious

5

bodily injury and death to brandishing, are somewhat

6

different in that the serious bodily injury and death are

7

results, whereas brandish and discharge are conduct of the

8

defendant.

9

being treated more seriously are seeking to address the

But we contend that the brandish and discharge

10

same possible results; that is, if a defendant merely

11

carries a firearm or possesses a firearm, it is far less

12

likely that serious bodily injury or death will result

13

than if the defendant brandishes or discharge --

14

discharges --

15

QUESTION:

Can I -- can I go to Apprendi?

16

Because the -- I want to just focus you a little bit,

17

assuming you lose on this argument.

18

this is hard for me because I dissented in Apprendi.

19

want to know how you, as a person living with the case,

20

understands it.

21

Imagine two statutes.

I want to know -- and
I

I just want to know if

22

you think Apprendi applies to the second of the two

23

statutes.

24

years for robbery, but if a gun is discharged, up to 15.

25

There's no question that Apprendi applies to that second.

The first statute says the sentence is up to 10

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Doesn't it?

2

MR. INGRAM:

3

QUESTION:

4

Now, suppose I take that same statute and I just

I agree with that.

That's what Apprendi is about.

5

rewrite the words as follows.

6

of robbery is 15, but unless a gun is discharged, you

7

shall not sentence to more than 10.

8

statute treated identically to the first in your

9

understanding and the understanding of the bar?

10

MR. INGRAM:

QUESTION:

14

MR. INGRAM:

QUESTION:

My understanding is that

Both.
-- latter statute that you have

Both.

So, the wording of it doesn't

matter.

18
19

Yes.

described.

16
17

That's

Apprendi would cover the --

13

15

Now, is that second

what I'm trying to get at.

11
12

The maximum for this crime

MR. INGRAM:

No.

I contend that it -- it does

not.

20

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, if that's the case,

21

I'd also like -- and this is my other -- only other

22

question.

23

defense bar, I understand, of which you're an important

24

part, wants this extended, and my question is why.

25

I'd -- I'd like to get your understanding.

The

And this is my, why -- what I have trouble

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

seeing in this.

2

what's likely to happen is the prosecutor will come in,

3

and it's primarily about drug cases.

4

fine, we'll go to the jury.

5

say you were in Chicago?

6

two kilos of drugs, and then you have to get in front of

7

the jury and argue my client was in Chicago, but just in

8

case he happened to be around, there was only one kilo.

9

Now, that's impossible for you to argue.

10

It seems to me as a practical matter

And they'll say,

You want a trial?

Fine.

Fine.

You

We say that there were

Now, given that kind of problem, why does the

11

defense bar, why do you, and why does everyone else -- why

12

are they so anxious to extend this case?

13

MR. INGRAM:

Your Honor, that is not a problem

14

that the defense bar does not already face.

15

context that you described in a drug case, in Federal

16

court now the evidence presented at trial will involve

17

both possession with intent to distribute evidence, as

18

well as quantity evidence.

19

QUESTION:

In -- in the

Yes, but still under the present law,

20

if you have a good claim as to whether it's one kilo or

21

two and the evidence is in dispute, you find the guilty

22

verdict come in.

23

you say, now, judge, we want -- we want to go into the

24

evidence here about how much drug there really was.

25

can't do that if you have to do it all at the same time in

At that point, you go to the judge and

You

front of the jury.
MR. INGRAM:

As a practical matter, in Federal

3

court, the -- the Federal judges at sentencing rely on the

4

trial evidence.

5

that I am hearing evidence about quantity that I want to

6

dispute because I know it's going to come up later in a

7

sentencing hearing, but I don't dare do that here because

8

I am telling the jury that there was no possession at all.

9

So, it is a dilemma that we face now and -- and faces

So, a defense attorney knows during trial

10

attorneys, for example, in cases where you admit my client

11

did kill someone, but not with malice aforethought.

12

often you do have to negate additional elements, and you

13

do have that dilemma already.

14

new dilemma for us.

15

QUESTION:

Quite

This would not create any

Well, let me rephrase Justice

16

Breyer's question slightly or -- or make the point that I

17

think underlies part of his question.

18
19
20

Apprendi is not a -- true or false?

Apprendi is

not an unmixed blessing for the defense bar.
MR. INGRAM:

I think it can create some

21

problems, as we just described, but they're not problems

22

that we don't face in other areas and on other --

23

QUESTION:

Well, given Apprendi, of course, you

24

face the problem.

25

matter, which we cannot -- which I think we're unlikely to

But looking at Apprendi as an original

do, it -- it has -- it imposes some real disadvantages on

2

defendants, does it not?

3

MR. INGRAM:

I do not think they're real

4

disadvantages.

5

-- some difficulties that defense attorneys face all the

6

time.

7
8

I think they're just -- they're just some

QUESTION:

Well, but the case Justice Breyer

puts to you shows a very real difficulty.

9

MR. INGRAM:

And as I've described, that is a

10

difficulty that we face already.

11

important --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. INGRAM:

And -- and the

Because of Apprendi.
No, Your Honor.

Before Apprendi.

14

That problem faced defense attorneys in -- in a number of

15

contexts.

16

so much with the problems it creates, because they're not

17

new problems, but with -- with the fact that mandatory

18

minimums add additional deprivations of liberty that

19

should be addressed by the jury and found beyond a

20

reasonable doubt and not -- not left to the discretion of

21

trial judges, based on the case law of this Court,

22

including Apprendi itself.

23

And -- and we're really more concerned here not

We are relying on the constitutional rule

24

announced in Apprendi.

25

McMillan and Patterson, the Court had acknowledged that

Prior to Apprendi, in -- in

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there were some limits, some constitutional limits to what

2

a legislature could do in defining the elements of a

3

crime.

4

what those limits are.

5

But it -- the Court had never announced exactly

Now, it is true that Apprendi was limited to an

6

increase in statutory maximums because that is what the

7

case was about.

8

the constitutional rule that was the underpinning of the

9

Apprendi holding was that as -- as stated by the majority

10

in endorsing the concurring opinions in Jones as follows,

11

it is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from

12

the jury the assessment of facts that increase the

13

prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal

14

defendant is exposed, and equally clear that they must be

15

proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

16

Those were the facts of the case.

But

So, the constitutional rule of Apprendi was any

17

fact that increases the range, either the floor or the

18

ceiling, of the prescribed penalties are constitutionally

19

elements that must be alleged by the defendant -- by the

20

prosecution in the charging document and must be proved.

21

QUESTION:

What about things like the Federal

22

Sentencing Guidelines which also have the effect of

23

increasing the range of the penalty within certain limits?

24

There are lots of factors there that under the guidelines

25

the judge would still decide.

Under your argument,

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Apprendi would throw all those out.

2

jury.

3

MR. INGRAM:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. INGRAM:

It has to go to the

I disagree, Your Honor, and --

Why?
-- and I do agree with your

6

statement that there are lots of things that the

7

guidelines allow the judges to consider.

8
9

First of all, mandatory minimums are just that.
They are mandatory.

They do not allow a judge to consider

10

any mitigating factor, however strongly the judge may --

11

may believe in those mitigating factors, to go below.

12

sentencing guidelines, first of all, expressly allow the

13

judge to consider a number of aggravating and mitigating

14

factors.

15
16

QUESTION:

The

But they may be unconstitutional

under your theory.

17

MR. INGRAM:

They are not because we contend

18

that the guidelines, unlike mandatory minimums, still

19

leave the judge with lots of discretion.

20

United States, this Court --

21

QUESTION:

In Koon v.

The question is under your theory of

22

Apprendi, which imposes constitutional limits on

23

discretion for judges, that can be given to judges, how

24

many of the sentencing factors are going to fall by the

25

wayside?

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. INGRAM:

I -- I submit that none of them

2

will because none of those factors mandate a particular

3

penalty to the exclusion of any mitigating offense.

4

example, under the drug guideline, if the defendant

5

possessed a firearm, then in a sense a two-level increase

6

is mandated or called for, but that nevertheless still

7

allows the judge, without a Koon discretionary

8

departure --

9

QUESTION:

For

Well, that's exactly the kind of

10

thing that presumably under your argument would have to go

11

to the jury, whether he possessed a firearm, or the

12

quantity of drugs involved.

13

MR. INGRAM:

No, it is not, Your Honor, because

14

the judge in such a case would still have the ability to

15

depart, or first of all, to reduce the offense level for

16

other mitigating facts in the case.

17

QUESTION:

You're -- you're saying that just the

18

level is kind of inchoate until the sentence comes out

19

because there are other factors that could be applied?

20

MR. INGRAM:

The -- the sentencing guideline

21

range, once established, is mandatory unless and until the

22

judge determines that there is a legally permissible basis

23

to depart downward or upward.

24

there are innumerable bases for allowing the judge to

25

exercise that discretion.

And Koon recognized that

13

1

QUESTION:

So long as -- so long as the upward

2

or downward departure is there, you say Apprendi doesn't

3

cover it.

4

MR. INGRAM:

5

QUESTION:

Or downward, anyway.

6

QUESTION:

Oh, I see now.

7

QUESTION:

Downward or upward?

8

QUESTION:

I said upward or downward.

9

QUESTION:

I know.

10

(Laughter.)

11

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Or upward?

And he agreed.

I'm surprised that he agrees.

I -- I

12

would think you would -- you would say that -- that it's

13

only the downward that -- that saves the guidelines.

14
15

MR. INGRAM:

Well, I think it is in this case.

The -- the fact that the judge can depart downward --

16

QUESTION:

I mean, suppose a judge could not

17

depart downward under the guidelines, could only -- only

18

depart upward, you'd have a mandatory minimum, wouldn't

19

you?

20
21
22

MR. INGRAM:

You would have.

But that --

that -QUESTION:

Okay.

So -- so, what you agree with

23

is that so long as the judge, under the guidelines, has

24

the option of departing downward, you wouldn't -- this

25

case would not necessarily decide the guidelines.

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. INGRAM:

That is correct.

2

QUESTION:

Suppose --

3

QUESTION:

How -- how does a judge have the

4

opportunity to depart downward under the guideline if the

5

guideline says if he had a gun, you're supposed to go up?

6

I just don't understand your argument at all.

7

MR. INGRAM:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

increase it.

Because that --

-- purpose is if he has a gun, you

Why isn't that an Apprendi thing under your

theory?

11

MR. INGRAM:

Because the judge still -- that --

12

that does not bind the judge at that level.

13

still --

14

QUESTION:

The judge

Suppose -- suppose the judge says,

15

now, it's the policy in this court and in this

16

jurisdiction, counsel, that if you come in and your

17

defendant has a gun or has brandished a gun, I'm going to

18

go upward.

19

decided, and he said, you know, I would have given your

20

counsel -- your client six months if he hadn't brandished

21

the gun, but he brandished that gun: 5 years.

22

contend he didn't brandish the gun.

23

Apprendi control that?

24
25

I want you to know that.

MR. INGRAM:

Then the case is

And you

Why shouldn't

Because the -- the constitutional

rule announced by the Court is that if a legislature

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

mandates an increase in the prescribed range of penalties.

2

In the case you've described, Your Honor, the judge,

3

although he says I would still -- I will always go up, he

4

-- he still has the freedom to not go up.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. INGRAM:

7

10

And -- and he is subject to an

abuse of discretion standard on appeal.

8
9

So --

QUESTION:

So -- so, in your view, Apprendi

stands for the proposition that legislatures cannot
control judges in the sentencing process.

11

MR. INGRAM:

No.

My -- my -- in a sense that is

12

true.

13

have the power to determine what conduct they're going to

14

criminalize and to define the elements and the prescribed

15

punishment for those elements as long as it is not cruel

16

and unusual.

17

My position is constitutionally that legislatures

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I think Apprendi is

18

clearly binding here, and -- and we have to decide how --

19

how it should be applied.

20

I -- I do have some problems in -- in this case

21

because of the fact that I think the statute is a little

22

bit different than Jones.

23

structurally the same.

24

shouldn't apply where judges have discretion.

25

MR. INGRAM:

I -- I don't agree that it's

And I really don't see why this

Is your question why would this --

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

why would the Apprendi doctrine not apply where the judge

2

has discretion?

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. INGRAM:

That's part of my concern, yes.
Well, I think the answer to that is

5

that constitutionally the -- the rule announced in

6

Apprendi is that where a legislature mandates a particular

7

mandatory minimum or maximum, then that is where the

8

constitutional demands that the -- those facts be tried by

9

beyond a reasonable doubt --

10

QUESTION:

Where -- where a judge has

11

discretion, I suppose no single fact requires a certain

12

sentence.

Isn't that right?

13

MR. INGRAM:

14

QUESTION:

15

That's correct.

By definition, where the judge has

discretion, no single fact requires a certain sentence.

16

MR. INGRAM:

17

QUESTION:

That is correct.

But as a practical matter, even in --

18

in this, suppose this judge thought that the -- Harris

19

should not have gotten more than 5 years.

20

well, the evidence of brandishing could go either way, so

21

I want to give him 5 years.

22

brandishing.

23

prosecutor I suppose couldn't say anything about.

24
25

So, he says,

I'll find -- I won't find

That kind of discretion you -- the

A judge -- a judge has that discretion no matter what
the legislature rules are.

He can say, it's a close

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. INGRAM:

-- did not brandish -- that is, if

3

it was considered to be an element and the jury determined

4

that he did not brandish -- then first of all, he would be

5

not guilty of the crime, because that would be an element

6

that must be proved, and any element that is not proved

7

beyond a reasonable doubt means that he would be not

8

guilty of the crime.

9

But if there, for example, was some accompanying

10

charge that the defendant was found guilty of and not the

11

brandishing, then certainly the judge would have the

12

discretion to consider whether the firearm was brandished

13

or discharged.

14

QUESTION:

Are you saying that if he were

charged with this offense and charged specifically with

brandishing, and the jury found him not to have

brandished, he would have to be acquitted?

MR. INGRAM:

That is correct.

Wouldn't -- wouldn't there be a

lesser included offense of everything in the statute

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14
15
16

The

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court's decision in McMillan v.

17

Pennsylvania forms the backdrop for both the statutory and

18

the constitutional questions in this case.

19

As a matter of statutory interpretation, the

20

amended section 924(c) creates one crime with a minimum of

21

5 years and a maximum of life in prison and then gives the

22

sentencing court additional guidance as to where the

23

penalty shall be set within that 5-year-to-life range.

24

The increase in the mandatory minimums does not run afoul

25

of the Apprendi rule and is, in fact, specifically

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

endorsed by this Court's decision in McMillan.

2

And on the constitutional question, this Court's

3

decision in McMillan 16 years ago established that it does

4

not violate the Constitution for a legislature to choose

5

one fact that has historically borne on the appropriate

6

penalty to be assessed at sentencing and give the judge

7

guidance as to what that sentence shall be.

8

QUESTION:

Well -- well, given the precedent of

9

Apprendi, suppose the judge says, now, you know, the jury

10

finds an enhancement because of harassment, and the judge

11

says, well, under -- let me begin again.

12

Under your theory of the case, the jury doesn't

13

-- the judge said, you know, I would ordinarily give you 6

14

months, but I -- I find there's a harassment here -- or

15

pardon me -- brandishing here, and so I'm going to give

16

you 5 to 7 years.

17

that's different than Apprendi.

18

me that the concerns Apprendi -- of Apprendi are fully

19

applicable here.

20

True, it's a mandatory minimum.

MR. DREEBEN:

True,

But it certainly seems to

Justice Kennedy, there are several

21

significant differences between the issue in a case like

22

this and the issue in a case like Apprendi.

23

the judge could not go above the jury's verdict based on

24

the Court's constitutional analysis.

in the sense of protecting the jury trial right, the

2

Apprendi rule tracks onto what the jury must find.

Here, regardless of what the jury finds, the

13

Here the

All that is happening is that

That's reinforced by the fact that the history

19

that this Court relied on, as one of its key determinants

20

in the Apprendi decision, is not present in this case.

21

The history in Apprendi, the Court concluded, showed that

22

it has been the rule down centuries into the common law

23

that the judge cannot give a higher sentence than based on

24

the facts that the jury has determined.

25

comparable historical rule that would support a preclusion

But there is no

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of judicial discretion within the otherwise applicable

2

range.

3

The history of sentencing in this country shows

4

that within the maximum sentence established by the jury

5

verdict, judges have been often given tremendous amounts

6

of discretion on what sentence they should impose.

7

the history of sentencing also reveals that legislatures

8

have frequently intervened in order to establish more

9

precise rules to govern that discretion.

But

And the --

10

therefore, there is no broad historical rule that is

11

contradicted by a statute like the one in this case and

12

the one that was at issue in McMillan.

13

QUESTION:

But if that's so, do you -- do you

14

accept what -- what your -- what the petitioner said in

15

respect to my second statute, if you remember it?

16

second statute is, Congress passes a law and it says the

1

QUESTION:

No, no, no.

There is no doubt that

2

the statute I'm talking about intends the fact of

3

discharge to be a sentencing factor.

4

I mean, I can write it in such a way that that's clear.

5

MR. DREEBEN:

6

QUESTION:

There is no doubt.

If it's --

Now, at that point, Apprendi is a

7

constitutional rule, and therefore does the discharger

8

not have to be presented to the jury?

9
10

MR. DREEBEN:

As I understand Apprendi, it

would.

11

QUESTION:

All right.

If that's so, then what

12

did you say in your first answer?

13

You had a -- a purposive part and you had a historical

14

part.

15

All right.

You've had two parts.

Now, did you say anything, other

16

than saying eloquently and in several different ways, that

17

Apprendi concerned a maximum and this case concerns a

18

minimum, which I am sure that the petitioners would

19

concede?

20

MR. DREEBEN:

The significance of it concerning

21

a minimum is that under this statute, once the jury

22

returns a verdict of guilty, using or carrying a firearm

23

during in relation to an underlying drug trafficking

24

offense, the judge has the authority by virtue of that

25

jury verdict to sentence from 5 years to life in prison.

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

That's what the statute means.

2

What the mandatory minimum provision does is

3

say, within that range, we want this defendant sentenced

4

to not less than 7.

5

QUESTION:

All right.

That's certainly true.

6

But what's bothering me about it is every factor in

7

Apprendi -- and I was against Apprendi.

8

having that now being the law, it seems to me every

9

factor, other than the fact that this is a minimum and

10

I dissented.

But

that's a maximum, applies a fortiori in this case.

11

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the two most significant

12

factors, as I've tried to say -- and I'll try one more

13

time -- is that in Apprendi, the defendant could not have

14

gotten a sentence above 10 years based on the jury's

15

verdict alone.

16

to send him into the realm where the maximum was now 20,

17

and then he -- Apprendi got 12.

18

It took an additional finding by the judge

In this case, once the jury or, as it happens,

19

the judge -- the defendant waived a jury trial -- assigned

20

a finding of guilt to the defendant, the statute said,

21

your sentence, Mr. Harris, is between 5 years and life in

22

prison.

23

judge the authority to do something that he could not have

24

done before.

25

And the statute comes along and doesn't give the

QUESTION:

So, Apprendi is just a draftsmanship

1

problem, really.

2

legislature says, for this crime you get 20 years, but if

3

you brandish a weapon, you get another 5.

4

So, the legislature, that's okay.

5
6

So, I mean, it's bad if -- if the

I'm sorry.

That's bad.

For -- for this crime you get 1 to

20, but if you brandish, you get -- you get 25.

7

So, I say, okay, we'll revise it in light of

8

Apprendi.

9

if you brandish a weapon, it shall be 25.

For this crime, you get -- you get 1 to 25, but
That's okay,

10

although the other one wasn't okay.

11

the judge to find whether it's brandishing or not.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

And -- and it's up to

The difference in that statute,

13

Justice Scalia -- and I agree that that would not trigger

14

the rule that this Court announced in Apprendi -- is that

15

as the Court's opinion in Apprendi notes, if Congress

16

writes the second kind of statute and says the range is 1

17

to 25, it is exposing all defendants who are sentenced

18

under that statute to a possible sentence of 25 years.

19

And the Court said that structural democratic constraints

20

exist to deter legislatures from enacting statutes with

21

more draconian maximum penalties than they think are

22

appropriate for the worst of the worst who are going to be

23

sentenced under that statute.

24
25

Now, here when Congress amended section 924(c),
it went from a statute that had determinate sentences.

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Previously whatever you did under 924(c), the judge had no

2

sentencing discretion at all.

years or 30 years.

a more serious crime.

5

convicted of it, you're going to get at least 5 years with

6

an implied maximum all the way up to life in prison.

It was just 5 years or 20

Congress changed that and said this is
This is a crime which, if you're

7

By virtue of doing that, Congress envisioned

8

that there would a spectrum of offenders under section

tier and are just the least worst offenders under that

QUESTION:

So, if you tell the --

2

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question on -- on a

3

different topic?

4

argument here and I -- Justice O'Connor asked your

5

opponent, in essence, to what extent he thought the

6

sentencing guidelines were implicated by this case.

7

you comment on that subject?

8

impact of this decision will have on the sentencing

9

guidelines.

10

Because I think we understand your

MR. DREEBEN:

Tell us what you think the

Justice Stevens, it's unclear what

11

impact this decision will have on the sentencing

12

guidelines, I assume on the assumption that the Court

13

extends Apprendi to mandatory minimums.

14

Would

The sentencing guidelines are like mandatory

15

minimums in certain respects.

16

the judge has determined by a preponderance of the

17

evidence, the defendant's conduct and criminal history,

18

that by statute the judge is to give a sentence within.

19

But they differ from mandatory minimums in that the

20

statute further says that the judge can depart from the

21

guidelines sentence based on an aggravating or a

22

mitigating fact that distinguishes the case from the kinds

23

that the guidelines' drafters had in mind.

24
25

They provide ranges, once

Now, the guidelines are -- are different
primarily in that there is a broader range of discretion

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

available for the judge to depart than there is under a

2

mandatory minimum.

3

I emphasize that this is a question of degree

4

rather than one of kind because even these mandatory

5

minimums under section 924(c) can be departed from.

6

the Government makes a motion that says the defendant has

7

rendered substantial assistance to the Government in the

8

prosecution of others, that authorizes the judge to depart

9

from what is otherwise a mandatory minimum.

If

That same

10

ground for departure also exists within the guidelines,

11

and it accounts for more than half of the departures that

12

exist in the guidelines.

13

Now, the guidelines do, of course, provide a

14

further zone of less guided discretion to the judge in

15

when he can depart.

16

Government in this case, we will be back saying that that

17

zone of discretion distinguishes the guidelines.

18

the Court agrees with that or not will be an open

19

question.

20

QUESTION:

And if this Court rules against the

Right.

Whether

I understand, but at least

21

the -- at least the argument that your opponent made would

22

be available to the Government.

1

I did not understand.

I want to be sure I don't

2

miss this point that you made in your answer.

3

argue that in this case it's really not a mandatory

4

minimum because there is the discretion in -- in the

5

prosecutor to ask for -- for a deviation from the statute?

6
7

MR. DREEBEN:

No, not in the sense that Your

Honor is asking the question.

8
9

Do you

But I -- I do wish to underscore that there is
-- there is a range of ways that Congress can draft

10

statutes and the States can draft statutes.

11

drug statutes, for example, there's not only the

12

substantial assistance departure that I've mentioned, but

13

there's also a departure for first-time offenders called

14

the safety valve.

15

discretion to the judge.

16

Under the

Now, that adds an additional amount of

And any constitutional rule that this Court

17

develops for mandatory minimums is going to have to be

18

very careful in articulating how much discretion is enough

19

in order to make the mandatory minimum no longer mandatory

20

and no longer minimum.

21

of the substantial assistance departure is enough to take

22

it out of a rule that says never means never, and if -- if

23

Congress says never, then the judge can't make the

24

finding.

25

It could be that the availability

That is precisely why we urge the Court to

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

adhere to McMillan v. Pennsylvania which held 16 years ago

2

that it is permissible for -- for the legislature to

3

provide additional guidance.

4

possibility that particular statutes may fall under a

5

constitutional rule, but it didn't prescribe the sort of

6

rigid rule that petitioner is advocating in this case.

7

QUESTION:

And the Court left open the

Mr. Dreeben, apart from one being

8

within the jury zone and the other not, is there a

9

rational distinction between saying, judge, you can't add

10

on 2 years at the top and saying you can't subtract 2

11

years at the bottom?

12

MR. DREEBEN:

The rational distinction, Justice

13

Ginsburg, is that in the former case, the defendant has a

14

right to a jury trial that has to find him guilty on all

15

the facts that are going to determine the longest possible

16

time that he can spend in prison.

17

Under this statute, even if he does have a jury

18

trial right to brandishing -- just suppose that he did;

19

suppose that Congress gave it to him so we eliminate the

20

constitutional question -- the jury could find him not

21

guilty.

22

preponderance of the evidence, you did brandish, and

23

exercising my discretion, I'm going to give you exactly

24

the same 7 years that the statute called for.

25

And the judge could still say, well, I think by a

The fact that that can happen shows, I think,

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that the right that's in play here is not a right to a

2

jury trial that will protect the defendant against the

3

possibility of this increased punishment.

4

to have a judge with unlimited discretion not to impose

5

the mandatory minimum even if he finds brandishing,

6

because that is the distinction that I think both

7

petitioner and I draw between the sentencing guidelines

8

and this mandatory minimum.

9

discretion is simply not the Apprendi right.

10

It is the right

And the right to judicial
It's not a

right that's been historically recognized.

11

And if this Court were to accept respondent's --

12

or petitioner's analysis of the constitutional rules that

13

govern here as being drawn from the ex post facto cases,

14

which is essentially what he relied on in his reply brief

15

and in this Court, the Court would have to fashion a far

16

more sweeping constitutional rule than would address

17

merely mandatory minimums, because the ex post facto cases

18

are triggered by any substantial disadvantage to the

19

defendant.

20

essentially says, I want a rule that means that anytime I

QUESTION:

7

MR. DREEBEN:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Is that the implication of Apprendi?
That is the --

Is that where we're headed, in your

view?
MR. DREEBEN:

I hope not, Justice O'Connor,

11

because I think that the Apprendi rule, as bounded by the

12

history that the Court relied on and the explicit

13

statements of its holding, coupled with the Court's

14

recognition that, yes, legislatures can write statutes

15

that will achieve similar results to Apprendi but will do

16

it in an acceptable form, all of those things suggest that

17

the Court did not have a broad ruling on it.

18

QUESTION:

Do you have a sense of how the

19

application of Apprendi is working out in the system now?

20

I mean, how is it being applied?

21

has changed as a result?

22

MR. DREEBEN:

What's happening?

What

Well, retrospectively Apprendi has

23

caused a considerable amount of judicial chaos as courts

24

have attempted to sort out harmless error, plain error,

25

and retroactivity considerations, one of which is before

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Court next month in the Cotton case.

2

Prospectively, the United States has responded

3

to Apprendi by having facts that raise the -- the maximum

4

be submitted to the jury.

5

practice, cause some complications in particularly

6

intricate conspiracy cases where the jury has to make

7

separate determinations as to each conspirator.

8
9

And it does, as a matter of

It also creates the kinds of issues that Justice
Breyer was talking about for defendants who are hampered

10

to some extent in their ability to present dual

11

alternative defenses of the nature, I wasn't involved in

12

this conspiracy, but if I was, I'm only accountable for a

13

certain amount of drugs, because the jury is being asked

14

to make that determination.

15

affirmatively, the judge is not going to be in a position

16

at sentencing to second guess that.

17
18

So, Apprendi does -- does restrict the -- the
defendant's ability to make a defense --

MR. DREEBEN:

Their primary desire to date so

far, Justice Scalia, has been to get all of the old

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

sentences in the pre-Apprendi regime overturned.

And when

2

they've finished with that agenda, maybe they'll turn to

3

trying to get different proceedings at trial.

4

QUESTION:

But as far as you're concerned --

5

QUESTION:

To get it expanded.

6

MR. DREEBEN:

As cases like this reveal, there's

7

been an effort to expand Apprendi to what could be viewed

8

as its widest logical implications, because although I've

9

presented a theory for why Apprendi should be read

10

narrowly to avoid disrupting the traditional ability of

11

legislatures to structure sentencing, there is obviously

12

within the opinion the seeds of a much more fundamental

13

change in the --

14

QUESTION:

Yes, but those are extensions --

15

extensions on the -- on the basis that you've said, which

16

I now understand, is you say, well, there has to be a jury

17

finding for anything that will lead to a longer maximum

18

term, the highest possible term.

19

if that's so, you also have to have a jury finding for the

20

shortest mandatory term, because the shortest mandatory

21

term is far more important to any individual defendant

22

than the highest theoretical possible term.

23

that's what their argument rests upon, and that sounds

24

basically true.

25

you're talking about.

And they say, yes, but

And I think

And it doesn't lead you down the path

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think that it would be

2

true for a defendant like the defendant in Jones who was

3

convicted by the jury of a crime that carried a 15-year

4

penalty.

5

QUESTION:

No, there are some -- there are some

6

exceptions, but they're saying in general.

7

what's -- I want to be sure I -- I'm in a slight dilemma

8

because I think Apprendi was not right.

9

it is.

10

And -- but

But still, there

And the -- but the -- the question -- I want to

11

be sure you finished Justice O'Connor's question.

12

understanding is prospectively a ruling against you here

13

would not give the Government a lot of trouble.

14

Prospectively what you would do is you would simply charge

15

in the indictment every factor related to mandatory

16

minimums and go and prove it.

17

That isn't some tremendously difficult thing to do, or

18

not?

19

MR. DREEBEN:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. DREEBEN:

My

And that's not herculean.

The Government could do that.

They could do it.
The States have a much wider range

22

of mandatory minimum sentencing programs.

24

number and wider range of State mandatory minimum

25

programs.

I'm not in a position --

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

QUESTION:

Well, having read those, do you have

any impression in respect to the practicalities of it?

3

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that the States will

4

suffer increased practical problems compared to the

5

Federal Government because in the Federal Government, the

6

mandatory minimums are in relatively specific areas and we

7

could, indeed, go forward and charge and prove them to a

8

jury.

9

The more fundamental implication of an extension

10

of Apprendi within the maximum term is that it does raise

11

greater questions about the constitutionality of schemes

12

such as the sentencing guidelines.

13

not only on the Federal level but prevalent throughout the

14

States as well.

15

between whether mandatory minimums are mandatory enough to

16

trigger any constitutional rule, versus sentencing

17

guidelines not being, is going to require a process of

18

adjudication, and there's no way to predict where that

19

will end up.

20

Court interprets the rule that it announced in Apprendi

21

and then if it applies it here, how it applies it.

Those are, of course,

And -- and the process of drawing lines

It will largely depend on how broadly this

22

If there --

23

QUESTION:

May I ask you just a short -- so I

24

don't lose the point?

25

you mentioned a statute that makes the mandatory minimum

In our discussion a little earlier,

Alderson Reporting Company

1

not 100 percent mandatory because the Government may ask

2

for a -- a departure.

3

the Government to make such a motion?

What is the statutory authority for

4

MR. DREEBEN:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. DREEBEN:

Under 18 U.S.C., section 3553(e).

3553.
Yes.

The Government can file a

7

motion for substantial assistance of the defendant in the

8

prosecution of others, and upon that motion, the judge can

9

go below.

This Court analyzed that statute in Melendez v.

10

United States several years ago, a case which I believe is

11

cited in our brief.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, are you going to say

13

anything before you get done about the statutory

14

construction question?

15

statute is like Jones, wouldn't that be the end of it?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Because I'm -- if we said the

Correct.

And, Justice Ginsburg, I

17

-- I agree with the suggestion of Justice Souter earlier

18

that this statute is not identical to the Jones statute

19

and shouldn't be construed identically to it.

20

First and most fundamentally, in Jones and again

21

unanimously in Castillo, the Court commented that a

22

statute that's written, as section 924(c) is written, has

23

the look of the creation of sentencing factors when you

24

start off looking at it.

25

to analyze a number of structural features that suggested

In Jones, the Court then went on

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

that the initial look was unreliable.
Here the initial look is reliable.

Unlike in

3

Jones where the additional factors, serious bodily injury

4

and death, took the penalty from 15 years, first to 25

5

years, and then to life in prison, here the initial range

6

of the statute is 5 years to life, and the mandatory

7

minimums are fairly modest incremental increases in the

8

minimum sentence of 5 years and 7 years.

9

But most importantly, what is different from the

10

statute in Jones, the carjacking statute and the statute

11

here, section 924(c), is in Jones the carjacking statute

12

was modeled on three Federal robbery statutes.

13

those Federal robbery statutes contained serious bodily

14

injury or putting somebody in jeopardy of serious bodily

15

injury that were clearly offense elements, and the Court

16

commented that it could see no reason -- and the

17

Government was unable to adduce a reason -- why Congress

18

would have departed from the explicit models on which it

19

relied in drafting the carjacking statute.

20

firmer basis for concluding in the carjacking statute that

21

Congress probably intended an element.

22

Two of

So you had a

Here not only do you not have that feature,

23

because there was no Federal antecedent for section

24

924(c), but you have the very important consideration that

25

there's no constitutional doubt that should be applied to

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the construction of section 924(c).

2

the Court held that a series of cases over 25 years had

3

raised constitutional questions about increasing the

4

maximum, here the relevant precedent, of which Congress is

5

presumed to be aware, is McMillan v. Pennsylvania which

6

gave the legislature fair warning that it could provide

7

for the kind of statute that it's provided here.

8
9

Unlike in Jones where

And for those reasons, we think that the Fourth
Circuit and every other court of appeals that's analyzed

10

the question is correct in concluding that Congress's

11

approach in section 924(c) was a sentencing factor

12

approach.

13

constitutional approach.

14

The question then becomes whether that is a

QUESTION:

May I just ask another -- another

15

question about the history and the length of the history?

16

I particularly have in mind Justice Thomas's concurring

17

opinion in Apprendi.

18

are you aware of any long line of cases prior to McMillan

19

reaching the same result?

20

Other than the McMillan case itself,

MR. DREEBEN:

No, Justice Stevens.

And the

21

reason for that is that the history of sentencing in this

22

country moved from early statutes which were wholly

23

determinate.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. DREEBEN:

Right.
Then in the 19th century, the

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

legislatures and Congress and the State adopted a -- a

2

policy of having wide ranges and judicial discretion

3

within them.

4

of parole boards and -- and indeterminate sentencing in

5

many States.

Then later, legislatures moved to a system

6

And it was as a result of those processes that

7

in the mid-20th century and late 20th century, a variety

8

of commentators began to decide that this sentencing

9

scheme that gives so much discretion to various actors in

10

the system was not acceptable because it produced

11

unwarranted disparities against similarly situated

12

offenders.

13

meaning we know what -- why the judge is doing what he's

14

doing, and uniformity, namely, similar offenders will get

15

the same sentence, schemes came along like mandatory

16

minimums and guideline sentencing.

17

they were understood to be directions to limit judicial

18

discretion, not to wholly supplant it or to be the type of

19

statute that the Court invalidated in Apprendi.

20

And at that point, to promote transparency,

But I believe that

And it's really the petitioner's burden in this

21

case to show that these sentencing innovations are

22

unconstitutional.

23

carry that burden by pointing to a long line of consistent

24

judicial decisions.

25

long line of consistent decisions.

In Apprendi, the defendant was able to

Our submission is that judges have always had a

3

wide range of discretion.

4

to rely on not getting a stiffer sentence within the

5

maximum authorized ranges.

6

this Court's decision in McMillan, saying that it's

constitutional for the legislature to structure that

discretion, and we believe that the Court should adhere to

that position today.

23

additional facts.

24
25

The Government in the Federal context

Retroactively, there will be some cases that
will be sent back.

They will not be sent back to set

aside guilty verdicts or guilty pleas.

be sent back for resentencing, consistent with the opinion

3

in this case, just like they were with Apprendi.

not nearly the flood of remands on Apprendi, and Bailey

5

for that matter, as the Government contends, but in any

6

event, however many there are, if the Constitution demands

7

it, then so be it.

There's

8

The Government is concerned that a ruling in our

9

favor will undermine legislatures' concerns about limiting

10

judicial discretion in sentencing by enacting mandatory

11

minimums.

12

particular, and any statutes enacting mandatory minimums

13

in -- in the State courts will not go away with a ruling

14

in our favor.

15

will simply have to allege and prove the additional fact,

16

further limiting the judge's discretion, whereas currently

17

the judge has discretion to determine, by a preponderance

18

of the evidence, whether or not a fact exists or not.

19

Once a jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that it does,

20

the judge has no more discretion and must impose the

21

mandatory minimum.

Those statutes, the statute in this case in

The only difference is that the Government

extend the constitutional rule announced in Apprendi.

4

Apprendi was limited by its facts, but the constitutional

5

rule announced was that it is unconstitutional for a

legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of

facts that increased the prescribed range of penalties.

mandatory minimum increases the prescribed range of

penalties.
