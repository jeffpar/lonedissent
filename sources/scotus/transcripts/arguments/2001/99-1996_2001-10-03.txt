MR. JOHNSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

35 U.S.C., section 101 is set out at page 19a in
the appendix of the blue brief.

on plant varieties under section 101 of title 35 are

invalid.

specific statutory scheme that it crafted to govern

17

Federal statutory protection over this particular type of

18

living thing, plant varieties.

19

They're invalid because Congress has enacted a

The enactment of Congress by this specific

20

statutory scheme that it designed to provide the Federal

21

right to exclude others from reproducing plant varieties

22

evidences Congress' intent that it plant-specific Federal

23

statutory scheme is intended to provide the exclusive

Federal statutory means of excluding others from

25

reproducing plant varieties.

QUESTION:

The rights conferred by the statute

2

you're referring to are somewhat different than the patent

3

statute, aren't they?

4

MR. JOHNSON:

I do not -- no, that is not

5

correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

The right that the patents

6

claim in this case, the plant patent -- or the 101 patents

7

claim in this -- in this case, is the right to exclude

8

others from sexually multiplying the corn plant varieties

9

in this case or to use or sell corn plant varieties that

10

have been developed by sexual multiplication and -- and

11

produced by sexual multiplication.

12

these patents to exclude others from the right of sexually

13

multiplying these corn plants, the patent rights contended

14

for in this case would be of no value whatsoever.

15

QUESTION:

So, without using

But I -- I had understood from the

16

briefs that the rights conferred under the Plant Act are

17

different in some respects from that under the general

18

patent section.

Am I wrong in that?

19

MR. JOHNSON:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

The attribute that is protected under the plant-

21

specific acts is under the Plant Right of Protection Act

22

of 1970, the right to exclude others from sexually

23

multiplying that plant.

24
25

Now, this -- the statute is designed for
particular types of plants that require the ability to
4

1

sexually reproduce on a large scale in order to be

2

commercially valuable, and these are plants that are only

3

valuable if they can be produced commercially by seed.

4

Now, the -- the corn plants at issue in this

5

case -- the patents seek to protect the same utilitarian

6

feature or attribute of these corn plants, and that is the

7

right to sexually multiply -- exclude others from sexually

8

multiplying these corn plants.

9

QUESTION:

Let me ask you a specific question.

10

Under the PVP, can a farmer who buys the -- raises a crop

11

one year save seed to use for himself the next year?

12

that's the only protection that the -- that the developer

13

has is under the PVP, can the farmer do that?

14

MR. JOHNSON:

15

QUESTION:

16

Yes, Mr. Justice Souter.

All right.

Can the farmer do that if

the protection is under section 101?

17

MR. JOHNSON:

18

QUESTION:

No, Mr. Justice.

Then isn't the answer to the Chief

19

Justice's question yes, there is a difference in the

20

rights which are conveyed by 101 and by a PVP license,

21

respectively?

22

MR. JOHNSON:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

If

Yes, Justice Souter.

Well, then why didn't you answer me

that way in the first place?
MR. JOHNSON:

I -- Mr. Chief Justice, because I

1

misapprehended the nature of the question and I thought

2

that you were asking about the attributes -- the

3

attributes protected.

4

And yes, the rights that are contended for under

5

the patent would be rights that do not -- that do not

6

include the exceptions that Congress has specifically

7

legislated in the Plant Variety Protection Act, one of

8

which would be the seed saving exemption, which was

9

reaffirmed in the '94 amendments.

10

And another crucial exception is the research

11

exception because by the -- the use of patents, the free

12

exchange of plant genetic material which had occurred

13

prior to the use of patents, is prohibited by patents

14

because the seed companies now contend that under the

15

patent statute, since there's no research exemption, then

16

they can lock up the genes of the plant varieties on which

17

they have obtained patents.

18
19
20
21
22

Those are two important distinctions between the
rights conferred.
Now, section 2541 -- section 2402 of the Plant
Variety Protection Act -QUESTION:

Before you go on, has any court ever

23

held that it would be patent infringement for the farmer

24

to save the seeds?

25

MR. JOHNSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

There are many

1

suits in litigation now where district courts have held in

2

a judgment against farmers for saving seed that are

subject to patents.

10

And this is -- this is even true in

These are cases in the district

How about courts of appeals?
MR. JOHNSON:

I do not believe that -- that I

know of -- that a seed saving case has reached a court of
appeal -- a court of appeal yet.

11

QUESTION:

Does the PTO have a position on it?

12

MR. JOHNSON:

The Government is arguing as an

13

amici for Pioneer, for the -- for the appellee in this

14

case.

15
16

QUESTION:

Yes, but this case doesn't focus on

the saving seed exception.

17

But in distinguishing the utility patent from a

18

PVP certificate, or whatever it is, you have pointed out

19

that the utility patent is more beneficial to the patent

20

holder because the farmer can't even use the descendants

21

of the first seeds to plant again.

22

and I asked you if the -- that -- that was the position,

23

that that's the interpretation of the utility patent, that

24

is the interpretation of the PTO.

25

yes.

So that -- that's --

1

MR. JOHNSON:

I have not seen anything on that

2

position -- that position, one way or another, from the

3

PTO.

4

QUESTION:

As far as the -- the issue that is

5

before us, we do have a position of the PTO and of the

6

Federal circuit, both having more expertise than the rest

7

of the Federal court we're on in these questions.

8

we owe those decision makers some deference?

9

MR. JOHNSON:

Don't

Justice Ginsburg, I believe that

10

this case is a case of statutory construction.

11

regard to the Chevron deference to the PTO, the Congress

12

has specifically legislated on the precise issue that the

13

PTO has decided, that is, the issue of whether or not it

14

has authority under section 101 to grant patent -- utility

15

patents on plant varieties.

16

addressed this issue on three different occasions

17

historically and ruled on it.

18

Chevron deference is -- can be accorded to an agency when

19

Congress has specifically legislated.

20

Further, we are --

21

QUESTION:

With

Congress has specifically

a utility patent on a plant?

Congress has set up two

MR. JOHNSON:

It has explicitly stated this in

legislative acts on two occasions.

section 4886 of revised statutes by adding to it language

So, it wanted to have something.

Science has

This Court acknowledged that you could get a

10

utility patent for whatever was the bacteria that was in

11

the Chakrabarty case.

12
13

MR. JOHNSON:

Let me go back, if I may, for a

moment, and I'll answer your question on Chakrabarty.

14

In 1930, Congress placed -- or added to section

15

4884 of revised statutes the limitation on the -- that it

16

was -- the right was limited to asexual reproduction --

17

excluding others from asexually reproducing the plant.

18

But it is important to note -- and this is set out at

19

cert. app., page -- appendix 42.

20

You will also see section -- I think it's 4888

21

of revised statutes.

And in that section, Congress in

22

1930 inserted the -- or put in the provision that relaxed

the written description requirement.

Just a moment here.

Section 4888.

Ginsburg points out, there was some historic -- there was

It was a

It relaxed the written description in 4888.

If the language that Thomas Jefferson penned in

14

1793, which is the definitional language for utility

15

patents -- and he was a plant breeder, knew what plants

16

were -- if that language already subsumed plants, then the

17

only thing that Congress needed to do in 1930 was to add

18

section 4888.

19

And if it decided that it wanted to somehow --

20

if -- if the language that -- that Thomas Jefferson penned

21

included plants in 1930 and it included sexual

22

multiplication of plants and they wanted to limit it, then

23

they could have just put in the asexual limitation.

24

what they did is, they put in all three sections in 1930

25

because it was their intent to expand the definitional

limits of section 4886, which was the definitional

2

language that Thomas Jefferson originally wrote.

3

QUESTION:

Well, in other words, there's the

4

scheme established in 1930 and it is both more inclusive

5

than a 101 patent, and it gives you fewer rights.

6

that isn't -- doesn't mean, to track Justice Ginsburg's

7

initial question, that this is an explicit prohibition on

8

issuing a patent under 101.

9
10
11

MR. JOHNSON:
Congress did in 1930.
QUESTION:

We have to give meaning to what
It did not --

If you want to say if -- that we

12

should infer it, fine.

13

an explicit prohibition.

14

But

MR. JOHNSON:

That's your argument, but it's not

In 1950, in the revision of the

15

Patent Act, Congress dissembled section 4886 and placed

16

the plant patent language from 4886 in a separate chapter,

17

and kept the Thomas Jefferson language in -- and placed

18

that in section 101.

19

488 -- or 4888 and 4884 were also placed in chapter 15, a

20

separate plant-specific act.

21

And the other language from 486 and

Now, if the language -- if the definitional

22

language of 101, the other definitional language, subsumed

23

plants, there would be no reason to -- to take that

legislative action.

4

seems to me on your reasoning, the Court in Chakrabarty

5

should have said this is the paradigm example of what was

covered by the -- or what is covered by the PPA and

7

therefore it shouldn't fall under 101.

8

9

So, explain to me why -- why Chakrabarty

underlying circuit court case, Application of Bergy.

Souter, the dissent argued that the existence of the

plant-specific acts evidenced Congress' intent that no

QUESTION:

That's the foundation.
No, but could we go back, though, to

the facts of -- of Chakrabarty?

Because the problem that

7

I -- I have is it seems to me that on -- on just the

8

authorities that you're speaking of, Chakrabarty probably

9

should have come out the other way because you had a

10

specific statute, the PPA, which covered this asexually

11

reproducing plant, a bacterium, and yet the Court did not

12

say that the coverage of 101 was thereby defeated.

13

and maybe I'm missing something.

14

on your theory, it shouldn't have come out the other way.

MR. JOHNSON:

I don't understand why,

MR. JOHNSON:

Chakrabarty, their discussion of the PVPA and their

discussion of the PPA was for the purposes of explaining

QUESTION:

MR. JOHNSON:

10

QUESTION:

Well, I don't want to prolong this.
Yes.

But I take it then on -- on your

11

position, if we assume that the bacterium is a plant and

12

it asexually reproduces, the decision in Chakrabarty

13

should have been that it's covered by the PPA and there's

14

no 101 patent.

15

MR. JOHNSON:

If it would -- if it would be a

16

plant variety and if reproducing by dividing, which is not

17

sexual -- it's certainly not sexual multiplication as --

18

as plants do it, then that would be -- then the decision

should have been that it could have qualified for a PPA

are not infringements unless they involve further

propagation of the protected variety.

4

The reason that that provision is in there is

5

because in 1970, the brokerage business in seed corn and

6

cotton seed, soybean seed was already a thriving business.

7

It was not the intent of Congress to inject itself into

8

marketing situations that are governed by State law or by

9

the Federal Seed Act.

It had one thing in mind and that

10

was to regulate the right to exclude others from sexually

11

multiplying plant varieties.

12

anything with it, sold it to farmers who just planted that

seed and took it to the elevator.

So, it's not a PVP violation, number one, and

16

number two, we weren't sued under the Plant Variety

It was the act of choice.

19

We were sued under the Patent Act.

Now, the 1970 Plant Variety Protection Act

20

provides at section 2581 that the purpose of the act is to

provide adequate encouragement for research.

Mr. Sease, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDMUND J. SEASE

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6
7

MR. SEASE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In response to my colleague's representation

8

that Pioneer's sole case here rests upon a snippet of

9

statement in the legislative history of the '52 act,

10

quoted in Chakrabarty where the Court said, machined or

11

manufactured can include anything under the sun made by

12

man, we do, of course, rely on that piece of legislative

13

history, as did Chakrabarty.

14

But our case rests not upon that.

Our case

15

rests upon 35 U.S.C., section 101, which is in the regular

16

patent statute that says, and the plain meaning of those

17

words, as confirmed in Chakrabarty, that the corn plants

18

that are patented here are either articles of manufacture

19

or compositions of matter.

20

under the definitions cited with approval in Chakrabarty,

21

they're both because these categories of statutory subject

22

matter, under section 101 -- that is, they are sort of a

23

gatekeeper.

24

the next criteria of whether you are new, useful, or

25

nonobvious and can get a patent.

Or the fact of the matter is,

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I suppose their point was

2

that in many statutes, if A, B, and C are covered and C is

3

then removed, we make the inference that C is not intended

4

to be covered any longer.

5

sun language shows that they are such expansive terms in

6

101, that perhaps we don't apply that usual rule and that

7

you would prevail because of the terms being so general

8

and so universal in their -- in their coverage.

9

MR. SEASE:

But in this case, the under the

Justice Kennedy --

10

QUESTION:

I take it that's your position.

11

MR. SEASE:

They -- that is our position.

They

12

need to be general because the patent law needs to fit

13

ever-changing circumstances because today's science

14

fiction is tomorrow's science, and we are not in a

15

position to foresee what tomorrow's inventions will be.

16

And so, from 1793 till now, the statute has been crafted

17

and interpreted broadly.

1

of the argument is even though the language in 101 is

2

indeed just as broad as -- as you say and even though

3

Chakrabarty said living things aren't excluded, the

4

existence of -- of a separate statute dealing with the

5

same subject matter may be taken as -- as an implied

6

repeal to some extent if there's a conflict.

7

And one argument for saying that there is no

8

conflict here, as I understand it, is the argument that

9

what is set up by section 101 on the one hand and the two

10

separate plant statutes on the other are really two

11

separate regimes.

And

17

Mr. Johnson says, as I understood him a minute

is to get a -- a 101 patent.

have to do under 101.

MR. SEASE:

Justice Ginsburg, the answer to that

is there's nothing like it in the patent world, but there

And the reason historically that it came about

that we have these three separate regimes that occur for

discriminated against in that they were unable to comply

21

with the rigorous requirements of title 35 for a regular

11

Now, this petitioner would turn those two acts

12

and their legislative history on their head and use them

13

to limit patent coverage when, in fact, they were passed

14

by Congress for the purpose of granting some coverage that

There was, however, a transcript at the trial

MR. SEASE:

Because if you were to say that the

3

passing of the Plant Variety Protection Act in 1970

somehow is an implicit narrowing of 35 U.S.C., section 101

5

or an implicit exclusion of subject matter from that, you

need a far greater signal than just that.

QUESTION:

You've got the principle in your

favor that repeals, by implication, are not favored.

Yes.

And the case law of this Court says that there

Is there any case holding that, any

appellate court case holding that?

12

MR. SEASE:

There is no specific case in the

it -- it is sort of analogous to the repair/reconstruction

doctrine in the utility patent statute.

It's not analogous to that.

19

MR. SEASE:

It isn't.

20

But one of the reasons why utility patent

protection is so critically important to people in this

And to make any doubt about that crystal clear,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

IN SUPPORT OF THE RESPONDENT

4

6

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In Diamond against Chakrabarty, the Plant Patent

7

Act and the Plant Variety Protection Act played a central

8

role in the debates between counsel and between the

9

Court's opinion and the dissenting opinions.

The Court in

10

Chakrabarty rejected the position of the Government and of

11

the dissenting Justices that those two statutes showed a

12

congressional understanding that living things are not

13

protectable under section 101 and could be protected only

14

insofar as that subject matter was covered in those two

15

statutes and to the extent to which it was covered.

16

Court, instead, adopted a -- a broad interpretation based

17

on the plain meaning of section 101 referring to the

18

anything under the sun quotation, but also said quite

19

specifically at page 313 of volume 447 that the relevant

20

distinction is not between living and inanimate things for

21

purposes of applying 101, but between products of nature,

22

whether living or not, and human-made inventions.

23

there is no doubt that all categories of living things are

24

within the interpretation of 101 that the Court adopted.

25

The

So,

1

petitioners' contention, the Court is being asked to

2

disfavor, for purposes of applying section 101, and

3

indeed, to exclude from eligibility for section 101

4

protection the very subject matter for which Congress had

5

shown special solicitude and saw a particular need for

patent protection in these two acts at a time when it was

doubtful whether living things could get section 101

protection.

As of September 30th of this year, the

Department of Agriculture had issued 5,022 plant variety

certificates, whereas, as we explain in our brief, there

10

have been a total of 1,800 utility patents issued for

11

plants or plant components such as seeds and the like.

12

The -- the PVPA protection, the Plant Variety

13

Protection Act, is only on the plant variety itself so

14

that the availability of patents on seeds and other plant

15

parts is available only under section 101.

16

The court in Chakrabarty itself said that

17

nothing in the language or legislative history of the

18

Plant Variety Protection Act indicated any intention to

19

limit section 101 availability for patents when the

20

standards of section 101 are met.

21

fact, the relevant committee report on the PVPA in 1970,

22

which we quote on page 22 in our brief in the middle of
