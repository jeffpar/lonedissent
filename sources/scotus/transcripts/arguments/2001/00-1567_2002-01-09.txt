ORAL ARGUMENT OF GRENVILLE CLARK, III

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLARK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This is a case about discharging taxes in a
bankruptcy proceeding.
The Bankruptcy Code provides that income taxes

14

that are more than 3 years old are discharged in a

15

bankruptcy proceeding.

16

Youngs filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding in March of

17

1997, some 3 years, 5 months after they had filed their

18

1992 income tax return in October of 1993.

19

Code provides, on this simple set of facts, that the

20

Youngs' 1992 income tax obligation is discharged.

21

operative code sections are 727, 523, and 507, which I set

22

out at pages 10 and 11 of my brief.

QUESTION:

In the petitioner's case, the

The Bankruptcy

Well, they also filed an earlier

bankruptcy petition, didn't they?
MR. CLARK:

They did indeed, Your Honor.

That

1

was filed in May of 1996.

2

It lasted just short of 6 months, and the -- the argument

3

that the IRS has tendered in this case and below is that

4

you subtract out the 6 months they are in the prior

5

proceeding from the calculation of the 3 years, 5 months,

6

and when you do that, you come out with the Youngs ending

7

up with being only 2 years 11 months away from the 3-year

8

mark --

QUESTION:

10

petition dismissed?

11

MR. CLARK:

It was a Chapter 13 proceeding.

Well, why was the first Chapter 13

It was dismissed at the behest of

12

the Youngs for a variety of reasons that did not appear in

13

the record.

14

succeeded in selling their house and paying off mortgages

15

on the house that had -- they had placed on there.

16

on in the proceeding, they had gone through the trouble of

17

engaging special counsel, an attorney Noreen Farr, to do

18

something which does not appear in the record.

19

finally decided that they would dismiss the case rather

20

than go forward with it.

21

22

During the Chapter 13 proceeding, they had

Later

But they

The reasons that they did not --

They dismissed the case about 3 weeks before

23

they would have gotten to confirmation of their plan,

24

which they had submitted earlier in the case.

25

QUESTION:

But there was also the fact that they

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

-- in addition to dismissing the Chapter 13, the day

2

before that order was entered granting the dismissal at

3

their request, they started a new bankruptcy proceeding.

4

They started a Chapter 7 proceeding, and that way they

5

were able to stretch out the stay of any effort the

6

Government might have made to collect the tax.

7

MR. CLARK:

The -- the bankruptcy -- the Chapter

8

13 bankruptcy proceeding was dismissed.

The final closing

9

order in the case was entered in March of 1997.

The

10

motion that -- or the request, I think, that the Youngs

11

had filed was in October of 1996, October 23, 1996.

12

our position that the automatic stay expired as soon as

13

the case was dismissed and not later when the case was

14

closed a number of months later.

15

significant because in our view the IRS was entitled to

16

restart their enforced collection efforts against the

17

Youngs --

18

QUESTION:

It is

And I think that is

Do you have authority for that, for

19

saying that -- that it's not the date that the bankruptcy

20

was closed, but some -- the earlier date when they -- when

21

they made that motion?

23
24
25

MR. CLARK:

Yes.

It's in the Bankruptcy Code

itself, section 320 -- yes -- I'll have to get the -QUESTION:

Is the filing of the notice of

dismissal, which was October 23?

It's the filing of the notice

of dismissal, and that we contend is the dismissal.

14

because it's a voluntary proceeding.

QUESTION:

The debtor has the

20

MR. CLARK:

Are you saying that your

Yes, I am in this situation, Mr.

21

Chief Justice, because of -- the bankruptcy rules are a

22

little -- were a little vague at that point in time.

23

Whether you seek a dismissal by simply filing a, quote,

24

request or moving for a dismissal, the rule says that upon

25

a request for dismissal, the judge shall dismiss it.

In

if somebody is trying to manipulate the system, to game

8

the system, certainly the Government -- any party in

9

interest who was affected by the gaming, the manipulation

MR. CLARK:

I thought there was a finding of good

Yes, there was, Your Honor.
Was it a finding of good faith or --

or a finding that he was making no finding of bad faith?
MR. CLARK:

17

No.

The -- the judge below, Judge

Vaughn in the Bankruptcy Court, found in favor of the

19

Government, suggesting that there was a potential, in

20

similar cases such as this, for abuse or manipulation by

21

debtors in general.

22

found that he attributes no bad faith to the Youngs in

23

this particular situation, and I think that's an important

24

fact.

But in this case, Judge Vaughn had

Is it bad faith to look for a tax

loophole?

3

attorneys always did.

4

I think thought that's what all the tax

MR. CLARK:

It's certainly not in our view bad

5

faith to look for a tax -- for a way to get a grant of a

6

discharge of an obligation that you formerly owed.

7

QUESTION:

Do you think that that's what the

8

judge meant -- meant by not attributing bad faith?

9

didn't even think that your client was legitimately trying

10

to take advantage of a tax loophole?

11

I took it to mean.
MR. CLARK:

14

motion for summary judgment by the motion -- by the

other than those that were on summary judgment.

17

what the -- I see Judge Vaughn has -- as finding is that

18

he sees no evidence before the court from which he would

19

infer any manipulative or abusive scheme.

The -- there was no findings of fact as such

QUESTION:

20

Well, would it be manipulative or

21

abusive just to take advantage of the provision of the

22

statute?

MR. CLARK:

QUESTION:

25

No, Your Honor, it would not be.
So, the finding doesn't make any

difference one way or the other, does it?

to permit such a result?

Justice Breyer, you would have to

23

look at what happened in the prior bankruptcy I think to

see why the debtor was able to stay in bankruptcy for the

25

length of time that the debtor did and thereby supposedly

tax liability did the Government receive during the course

of the first bankruptcy?

MR. CLARK:

In the Youngs' case, the Government

did not receive any payments whatsoever.

The Youngs'

9

Chapter 13 lasted about -- just short of 6 months.

They

10

had not filed that tax case, that Chapter 13 until 2 and a

11

half years after they had filed their tax return.

12

but they did not receive any payment because we did not

get to confirmation in the Youngs' case.

1

QUESTION:

When the debtor asked to have the

2

Chapter 13 dismissed, could the judge have said, I will

3

enter the dismissal order, the closure order, but only on

4

condition that you do not attempt to assert a time bar,

5

should you -- as everybody knew was -- that was going to

6

happen, go into a successive bankruptcy proceeding?

7

-- would the judge have any authority to do that?

8
9

MR. CLARK:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

Did

Under, I

think it's section 349 of the Bankruptcy Code which

10

governs dismissals, the judge certainly has the authority

11

to put conditions upon the issuance of the dismissal.
QUESTION:

12

Well, then why is the dismissal

13

automatic, which is what we talked about at the very

14

first?

15

MR. CLARK:

Well, because the debtor -- I think

16

the procedural problem here is because the request -- the

17

rules, at least at the point of this request for dismissal

18

was -- was made, were a little vague as to how you request

19

or move for a dismissal.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. CLARK:

22
23

All right.
But the debtor has the absolute

right to request the dismissal.
The effect of the dismissal the judge can impose

24

a condition on to say, well, yes, we're going to dismiss

25

the case, but we're going to enter an order that says you

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

cannot count the 6 months that the Youngs were in

2

bankruptcy.

3

QUESTION:

Well, the debtor -- the debtor has a

4

right to reject that condition and say, if that's the

5

condition, I don't want to dismiss, I assume.

6

that's so, then the dismissal is not automatic.

7

you can't have it both ways.

8

MR. CLARK:

9

QUESTION:

And if
I mean,

I don't -- I think the -If he has a right to reject that

10

condition, then once you say the judge may impose a

11

condition, you have to say that -- that dismissal does not

12

occur automatically once you request it.

13

MR. CLARK:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. CLARK:

I think in that -You can't have it both ways.
I -- I'm not saying it's -- I think

16

what I'm saying is that the court has the ability to put a

17

condition on it.

18

wish to accept it, it's going to have to withdraw the

19

motion to dismiss.

20

If the judge -- if the debtor doesn't

QUESTION:

Right, and we don't know, until the

21

judge enters an order of dismissal, whether he's going to

22

put a condition on it.

23

is automatic as soon as you request it?

24
25

MR. CLARK:

So, how can you say the dismissal

I'm saying it's -- Justice Scalia,

I'm saying it's automatic in the sense that the -- the

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

debtor has an absolute right, quote/unquote -- and that's

2

not an absolutely absolute, but the debtor has a right

3

under Chapter 13 to have his case dismissed.

4

QUESTION:

No, but -- no, but you say he doesn't

5

because the judge can say, I'll let you dismiss it if.

6

Whereupon, the debtor can say no -- no deal.

7

an absolute right.

8
9

MR. CLARK:

So, it's not

Well, it's -- I think it is an

absolute right or nearly so.

I don't think that putting a

10

condition on it makes it less of -- of an absolute right

11

to dismiss.
QUESTION:

12

But it doesn't mean that you can't

13

equate the date that you file the motion to dismiss with

14

the termination of the Chapter 13.

15

judge could put a condition on it, then the -- the 13

16

proceeding doesn't terminate until the closure order is

17

entered.
MR. CLARK:

18

It can't be.

If the

I think the -- well, I don't know

19

that the judge could withhold or -- or delay the entry of

20

a dismissal order.

21

the time in Chapter 13 won't count against the --

MR. CLARK:

I do not know of any cases where, in

a Chapter 13, a condition has been imposed.

QUESTION:

So, this is totally speculative,

4

really, I think.

5

has occurred as many times as the Government says it has,

6

and if the solution that you suggest is available, I would

have thought some judge would have thought of it.

I would assume if the -- if this problem

MR. CLARK:

Well, I think no -- no judge is

going to impose the condition I think under section 349

10

unless the IRS comes in and makes a motion or brings it to

11

the attention of the court that -QUESTION:

12
13

But then the lawyers have never had

enough sense to do this, as I understand it.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. CLARK:

Government I think has gone on a different track on -- on

this issue.

QUESTION:

MR. CLARK:

20

QUESTION:

The answer is no.
The answer is no, Your Honor.
In -- in all events, let's assume

21

that we think that the dismissal occurs in -- it would be

22

March 13.

23

make a difference in this case?

Does the difference between October and March

24

MR. CLARK:

25

QUESTION:

No, it does not, Your Honor.
All right.

So, it doesn't make any

MR. CLARK:

This -- we got into this in the

3

court of appeals a little bit, but it really makes no

4

difference whatsoever in the computation.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Clark, can I get your

7

Because it may have something to do with my view of -- of

this case.

1

MR. CLARK:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Okay.

So, we're talking here only

3

about cases in which someone in good faith, at least as

4

far as the IRS can approve, commences a 13 proceeding, and

5

then for -- for some -- some plausible, good reason,

6

before it is concluded, dismisses.

7

MR. CLARK:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. CLARK:

10

QUESTION:

Is that how you --

Yes.
-- understand the situation?
Yes, it is.
Whose burden is it to show that there

11

was some reason other than just getting advantage of the

12

automatic stay?

13

show that?

14

Scalia's question -- that there should be a fact question

15

in every case as just what was the motivation of the

16

petitioner who file the Chapter 13 proceeding.

Do you have to put in any evidence to

I mean, you're suggesting -- I guess Justice

MR. CLARK:

17

I think there has to be -- if -- if

18

somebody is charging that there is an abuse, there has to

19

be some factual determination that there's an abuse.

20

-- under section 105, even the bankruptcy judge himself,

situation?

2

MR. CLARK:

I -- I do not think it is proper at

3

all to -- I -- there are several reasons why I think it's

4

improper.

5

First of all, the language of the statute itself

6

is very plain and straightforward and has no provision for

7

equitable tolling or any tolling.

8
9
10
11
12

QUESTION:

We have held that equitable tolling

applies in similar statutes which have no provision for
equitable tolling.
MR. CLARK:

Yes, I'm -- I -- I know that the --

I know that you have, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Well, I -- I thought your point is --

14

one of your points was that statutes of limitations are

15

different from this, that this is not a statute of

16

limitations.

17

MR. CLARK:

It's -- my point is that it is --

18

this is a part of the definition of which taxes can be

19

discharged in bankruptcy.

20

to defining which taxes can be discharged in bankruptcy.

21

There is this 3-year lookback period.

22

period where a taxpayer has filed a return late and then

23

we go to a 2-year lookback.

24

day period that the taxpayer/debtor must satisfy and that

25

is 240 days from the date of assessment.

There are several time elements

There is a 2-year

And then there's a third 240-

Now, the debtor

Alderson Reporting Company

1

must meet all three of these to be able to discharge the

2

taxes.

3

In the Youngs' case, the taxes were assessed

4

promptly, about 2 and a half months after they filed their

5

tax return.

They clearly met that one.

The -- they did

So, they -- that one

And the only one in question in this

10

3 years and do you toll the 3 years for the period of the

11

prior Chapter 13.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Clark, is the Government correct

13

in -- in pointing out that the debtor here could, instead

14

of seeking dismissal of the 13 and starting a 7, simply

15

have moved to convert the 13 into a 7?

16

MR. CLARK:

17

QUESTION:

Is that correct?

That is correct, Your Honor.
If -- if the debtor had done that,

18

the 3-year period would continue to have been calculated

19

as it originally was under the Chapter 13 proceeding.
MR. CLARK:

20
21
22

Yes, Justice Souter, that is

correct.
QUESTION:

Would -- would it have been error if

23

-- if the judge or any judge in a case like this, when --

24

when confronted with a motion or a request to dismiss,

25

simply questioned the debtor whether it was the debtor's

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

intent to start a Chapter 7 proceeding, and if the answer

2

was yes, for the judge simply to say, well, I will treat

3

your motion as a motion for a conversion and we'll grant

4

that?

5

Would that have been error on the judge's part?
MR. CLARK:

I think it would be error for a

6

judge to take a motion to dismiss a Chapter 13 and make it

7

a chapter -- and say, we are going to make it instead a

8

Chapter 7 case.

9

QUESTION:

Even when the debtor says, yes, my

10

plan, my intent is to -- is to initiate Chapter 7

11

proceedings.

12

MR. CLARK:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

Justice Souter --

The -- I take it the only harm to the

14

debtor in that case would simply be the -- the argument

15

about the 3-year lookback because the debtor would be

16

getting exactly otherwise exactly what the debtor wanted,

17

i.e., a Chapter 7 filing.

18

MR. CLARK:

Yes, Justice Souter.

But keep in

19

mind in the -- in the case of either dismissal or

20

conversion, in the example in the Government's brief, the

21

-- it does not do any good to seek conversion -- I'm sorry

22

-- to dismiss and then refile unless you're toward the end

23

of the 3-year period in any event.

24

is dismissed, now the 3-year period has expired, and now

25

you go the next day and you file your Chapter 7, saying,

So that when the case

1

well, I've been -- it's been now more than 3 years since

2

the filing of the return.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. CLARK:

Yes.
But in the meantime, of course, the

5

plan payments are being made, hopefully, to the Government

6

and to other creditors for the 2 years and however many

7

months.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, that -- that's so.

But, I

mean, even in the case in which there has been a

10

confirmation under -- under the Chapter 13 and plan

11

payments have been made, it may very well be that the

12

amount of tax liability that has actually been paid could

13

be minuscule, so that it would be very much in the

14

debtor's interest to -- to start a new Chapter 7 and save

15

whatever the balance due is on the taxes.
MR. CLARK:

16

Well, except that, Justice Souter,

17

the problem is that the tax payments are not going to be

18

minuscule during the Chapter 13.
QUESTION:

19

Well, whether they're minuscule or

20

not, if they're not 100 percent, the debtor still gains

21

something by going -- so far as the Federal taxes are

22

concerned, by dismissing and starting a Chapter 7 because

23

whatever the balance due is, in -- on the facts of a case

24

like this, the -- the debtor is going to -- going to

25

obtain.

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CLARK:

That is correct, Justice Souter.

2

But again, I would point to the fact that the Government

3

is getting something.

4

And in tax collection in general, apart from bankruptcy,

5

even when bankruptcy is not in the picture at all, the way

6

the Government is trying to collect taxes is through

7

installment payments as the Youngs --

8
9

QUESTION:

It may not get the whole amount.

Well, that's right.

But I think the

Government's answer to that is unless we, in fact, make a

10

compromise agreement, we're entitled to 100 cents on the

11

dollar.

12

may get 50 cents on the dollar before you go from 13 to 7

13

I -- I don't think really disparages the Government's

14

argument any.

15
16

And the -- the fact that -- that the Government

MR. CLARK:

The Government got nothing.
The Government did get nothing in

this situation, Justice Ginsburg, for the 6 months.
QUESTION:

And would there -- in -- in this very

21

case where the Chapter 7 was started the day before the

22

Chapter 13 was closed, was there any advantage, other than

23

wiping out the lookback period, to instituting two

24

proceedings rather than having the 13 converted to a 7?

25

MR. CLARK:

Well, the reason the Chapter 7 was

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

filed was because I think other creditors were descending

2

upon the Youngs.

3

in October, and that, of course, put everybody back into

4

the status quo ante, except with respect to the sale of

5

their house, of course.

6

once the case has been dismissed, to come forward again.

7
8
9
10

They had dismissed their Chapter 13 back

QUESTION:

But the creditors now were free,

Well, we're getting into filing

versus dismissal.
MR. CLARK:
QUESTION:

Yes.
But if -- if we take the order of the

11

court as what counts, there wouldn't have been any period

12

in which other creditors could have jumped in because the

13

Chapter 13 hadn't yet been closed.

14

So, from the point of view of the debtors here,

15

was there any advantage that they gained other than wiping

16

out the lookback period?

17

MR. CLARK:

With -- with the filing of the

18

Chapter 13, they obviously gained the advantage also of

19

eliminating their other debts.

20

QUESTION:

I mean, when they got to the point of

21

saying we're not going to make it under this plan, so

22

we're going to have to quit the 13, at that point they

23

could have done -- either asked for conversion to 7 or

24

started a new proceeding.

25

their viewpoint other than they'd get the benefit under a

reading of the statute of putting the Government out of

2

the picture because the 3-year lookback has run?

3

MR. CLARK:

I'm not quite sure I understand the

4

question, that they -- Justice Ginsburg.

I think they --

5

they get the -- when they -- when they dismiss and then

refile, they obviously get the benefit of discharging

their other taxes in -- their other debts, non-tax debts.

MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to address first the -- there's

been some discussion about protections that maybe or maybe

16

could not occur in a Chapter 13 proceeding to prevent the

17

18

that rarely, if ever, is capable of happening because we

19

don't know -- debtors don't telegraph to us at the time

21

that they plan to file a second bankruptcy.

MS. MILLETT:

QUESTION:

7

I think --

Or that that be a condition of -- of

the dismissal that you not -- that you not refile.
MS. MILLETT:

I think there's two difficulties

8

with that approach, and the first that it would be an

9

enormous burden in every Chapter 13 case that is filed and

10

then sought to be dismissed -- and an awful lot -- the

11

vast majority are -- to have that inquiry undertaken.

12

And secondly, there is -- there is no authority

13

under the code that we're aware of that allows a court to

14

condition -- a voluntary dismissal, which they have as of

15

right, on willingness to forego a discharge in a future

16

bankruptcy proceeding.

17

QUESTION:

But, I mean, let's assume someone has

18

in all good faith commenced a Chapter 13 and has in all

19

good faith dismissed it because, part the way through it,

20

said, you know, I think I can make it on my own now, and

21

-- and then, you know, sometime after that, decides, no, I

22

can't make it and -- and files another bankruptcy

limitations, and in the case at hand, we were equitably

12

tolling what was effectively a statute of limitations.

13

What's your other best case?

14

MS. MILLETT:

And Nassau Smelting v. Refining

15

Works, which is discussed in Honda v. Clark, was a

16

bankruptcy case where the proof of claim was not filed

17

until a year after the deadline and the Court allowed

18

participation nonetheless.

19

the proof of claim that's --

20

QUESTION:

And again, it's the nature of

I think in this case is exactly what Justice Scalia has

22

been saying, that this isn't a traditional statute of

23

limitations.

24

25

plus days tolled.

You have to do one of two things.

That's one thing you could do.

You

Or the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

second thing you could do is you could look to 105(a) and

2

you could say that the order that can be issued is an

3

order pay money -- this is in the section 7 -- pay money

4

as if this were the section 13 that hadn't been dismissed.

5

Now, both of those, the question would be, does

6

-- does the judge have the authority to do that?

And

7

looking simply to statute of limitations provisions

8

doesn't answer that question.

9

question.

It -- it provokes the

It proves you might be right, but -- but the

10

worrying thing is whether you can just stick those words

11

in, either plus days tolled, or read 105(a) in so broad a

12

manner.
So, those are the -- I'd like to know what

13
14

should we do and what's the authority for that.
MS. MILLETT:

15

To take the first -- the first --

first scenario first, the proposition for reading the

17

3-year lookback period as 3 years plus --

21

to the statute of -QUESTION:

Could you speak up a little bit, Ms.

Millett?
MS. MILLETT:

In deciding what the -- the

character of the lookback period is, equitable tolling

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

does apply in Zipes in filing a proof of -- filing of a

2

claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

3

There the Court described it as similar to a statute of

4

limitations, but it was not a statute of limitations.

5

equitable tolling does not require --

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. MILLETT:

8
9

So,

Which case was that?
Zipes v. TW -- Trans World

Airlines.
That does not require the presence in the actual

10

statute of limitations.

11

the question is whether Congress would have intended that

12

type of time limit to be subject to tolling principles.

13

And the -- we can either assume the lookback period would

14

have for many of the policy reasons that have been

15

discussed -- the -- the conclusion that results if we

16

decide that it is not something that Congress would have

17

intended to be subject to equitable tolling is that the

18

3-year lookback period is an empty gesture as far as

19

protecting the Government.

20

QUESTION:

It has to be a time limit.

If

The Congress --

You have no problem convincing me

21

about what I'd call the equitable merits of your side.

22

The problem you have, as far as I'm concerned, is how to

23

work, which route do we take and what's the authority for

24

doing it, just what I asked in the first place.

25

MS. MILLETT:

And that is I think -- and it's

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

both prongs of your -- of your question.

2

think that the nature of the time limitation is

3

sufficiently similar within the bankruptcy context.

4

is how you enforce claims within the bankruptcy context.

5

QUESTION:

It is -- we

This

Well, I don't think it is similar.

6

-- I -- I mean, the only thing -- the only respect in

7

which it's similar is that it involves time, but all of

8

the other cases that -- that you refer us to, the statute

9

of limitations proper, Zipes, they're all cases in which

10

action by the party seeking to enforce something is

11

limited by a period of time.

scenario.

Now, whether you call

In this case, it's -- it's not a matter of

16

whether the Government has filed in time at all.

This

17

lookback is quite a -- quite a different animal.

It's how

18

far back you -- you can go in -- in deciding which claims

19

cannot be discharged in bankruptcy.

20

Now, it involves time.

I guess, if you think

21

that's enough of a commonality, then -- then I'd agree,

22

but gee, I -- I don't think that's enough to -- to make me

23

think that we have the -- the authority by long tradition

24

to rewrite a statute so that where it says 3 months, it's

25

going to be 3 months -- 3 years, it's going to be on our

authority 3 years plus some other period of time.
MS. MILLETT:

I think this is exactly the

3

situation that you described.

It's like a typical statute

4

of limitations, and that is unless the Government takes

5

action within 3 years to enforce its claim, unless it acts

6

within those 3 years, it will, for all intents and

7

purposes and all practical purposes, within the unique

8

context of bankruptcy proceedings, have no claim left.

9

will be discharged.

10

QUESTION:

The Government has absolutely no control

MS. MILLETT:

That's right.

It eliminates --

21

Congress' vantage point that this was an enforcement

22

period, a collection time, and that -- that if the -- it

would eliminate stale claims, which this Court said in

Zipes is one of the purposes of a statute of limitations.

Can you file a lien against his property which

MS. MILLETT:

If we -- if we have assessed the

11

taxes, which in itself requires a 90-day period as a

12

matter of law, but if we have assessed the taxes, which we

13

had here, we can go file a notice of federal tax lien

14

which would protect us.

15

What happened in this case --

QUESTION:

MS. MILLETT:

That would protect us, but it's

18

important to keep in mind how tax collection works.

19

20

statutory provisions, tends not to descend immediately

21

upon taxpayers the second there's a liability.

QUESTION:

If you -- if you imposed a lien,

could you still work with the taxpayer?

prohibit you from trying to work it out, does it?

5

MS. MILLETT:

The lien doesn't

We -- we could have, but it

6

certainly has some consequences for -- for the taxpayer.

7

And -- and again we -- we try -- we try to work these

things out without going to that sort of adversarial level

of proceedings.

Sure.

We cannot impose --

Absolutely not.

That's part of

the automatic stay.
If I could get back to Justice Breyer's

21
22

question.

What we think is important here is -- is the --

23

the combination of the two factors that you discussed is

24

that this is sufficiently like a statute of limitations,

25

and Congress intended it to operate like a statute of

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

limitations, and it does operate like a statute of

2

limitations within the bankruptcy context.

3

combined that with the unique equitable powers the

4

bankruptcy courts have and the unique operation of

5

equitable principles within the bankruptcy context.

6

it's not an either/or.

7

is a sufficient reason as to why tolling of this lookback

8

period would be appropriate.

9

QUESTION:

And we've

So,

I think the combination of those

Ms. Millett, Mr. Clark said in his

10

brief that, well, if you're going to do this for taxes,

11

the same logic would apply to wage claims that have a

12

priority.

13

Is that -- is that so?

14

MS. MILLETT:

15

What else did he say?

Employee benefit claims.

Those are the only two nontax

provisions that have these type of --

QUESTION:

So, could you --

MS. MILLETT:

-- lookback periods.

And I -- I'm

assuming that it would, in fact, apply.

19

analyzed -- the same analysis would apply and assuming

20

that the same congressional purpose would be shown and the

tolling -- it would apply there.

23

I -- I haven't

It doesn't actually happen to be a problem in

Those types

2

avail themselves of this procedural roundabout, they would

3

have to file two bankruptcy proceedings very closely on

4

top of each other, and that just doesn't happen.

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. MILLETT:

And so, in order to

Well, as they did here.
No.

I mean, they would have to

7

file their first one, and then within 3 months to get out

8

of the 90 days, you'd have to file another one.

9

the first one lasted I guess approximately 6 months.

10

QUESTION:

11

pending to do what?

Ms. Millett, there is legislation
How is it drafted?

MS. MILLETT:

12

This --

It -- it is drafted to provide for

13

tolling of the lookback period during the pendency of --

14

during the time an automatic stay in a prior bankruptcy

QUESTION:

17
18

As an amendment to section 105 or

what?
MS. MILLETT:

I think it's to section 507, which

19

is -- 507(a)(8), which is what provides the lookback

20

Government faced with a taxpayer that had a big tax

liability and it looked like bankruptcy might be looming,

21

what would you advise the Government to do?

22

MS. MILLETT:

Depending on this Court's holding,

23

there -- I have to say in all candor the volume -- the

24

sheer volume of cases that the IRS handles in bankruptcy

25

makes much -- and it's handled often at the initial

and ask the courts to fix them.

3

We -- we don't run to the courts

And -- and I'm just very leery of extending our

4

-- our powers, the equitable powers that we've used in the

5

past, for extending statute of limitations, tolling

6

statute of limitations to this quite different situation

7

of a lookback.

8

Internal Revenue Code and there are other time provisions,

9

and I -- I'm not willing to say whenever there's a time

I -- and there are other lookbacks in the

10

provision, it's an invitation to us, if -- if Congress

11

hasn't foreseen every problem, to adjust it.

12

MS. MILLETT:

I think -- I think that given the

13

equitable powers of bankruptcy courts, most of those --

14

many of those time limits are in fact considered to be

15

subject to equitable tolling that are in the Bankruptcy

16

Code, although I don't know that this Court, other than

17

the proof of claim context, has ruled on the question.

18

But in deciding -- Congress legislated against

19

backdrop principles of equitable tolling.

20

whether this is the type of thing that should be subjected

21

to equitable tolling, this Court made clear in American

22

Pipe & Construction v. Utah that it's a question of -- of

23

congressional intent, not whether you think the provision

24

is substantive or procedural.

25

In deciding

And we think congressional intent drawn from the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

structure of the statute, the network of tolling

2

provisions, limitations on filings, conversion rules, to

3

think that all of those were put in by Congress not to

4

protect the Government's enforcement period but simply to

5

channel debtors into one particular procedural route for

6

not paying taxes is a highly unlikely assumption.

7

And to think that Congress would -- to read the

8

lookback period as intentionally empowering debtors not to

9

fight about how much taxes they owe, but to take an

10

admitted tax liability and say that because of what we do

11

in bankruptcy, not because of anything the Government did

12

in becoming a creditor or in enforcing its claim, we get

13

to decide that you will not have prioritized status.

14

will have, in some cases, not a minute of enforcement

15

activity, and we don't have to pay our taxes.

and the implausibility of this operation of the statute as

to allow this Court to toll a lookback period and

May I ask you a question about your

view of the automatic tolling statute?

11

this case, the notice of dismissal of the Chapter 13

proceeding was filed in October, and the actual dismissal

13

was not until March 13 of the following year.

14

the day before that that they filed the Chapter 7 so there

15

--

16

MS. MILLETT:

17

18
19
20

And it was

That's right.

-- was the base of their changing

their mind or something like that.
Is it your view that the automatic stay was in
effect between October and March?

21

MS. MILLETT:

22

QUESTION:

Absolutely, and --

Because I think your opponent seemed

23

to suggest maybe that wasn't so.

24

MS. MILLETT:

25

As I understand

Right.

In 1307(b), which is the

provision that allows automatic -- it's 11 U.S.C. -- that

Alderson Reporting Company

2

the -- that the debtor may -- may ask the court, but that

3

the court shall dismiss the case.

4

has been dismissed or closed, neither of which would have

5

happened under this provision until March, or a discharge

6

has been granted, which obviously did not happen in this

7

case, the automatic stay remains in effect.

8

unable to do any -- take any steps to enforce our claim.

9

QUESTION:

And so, until a case

And we were

And is it true that in this case

10

there was some kind of report filed on February 2?

11

there was activity in the case.

12

MS. MILLETT:

There was.

So,

A trustee had filed a

13

report, and there had been -- the court set time when it

14

got the -- the notice, it set the time for the hearing on

15

this or time for action on this.

16

and again, if -- if we're going to suppose that courts can

17

impose conditions on these dismissals, that would again

18

require -- assume that the case is alive and is still

19

before the court.

So, it was in fact --

20

But I think the statute is quite clear that it

21

-- that the debtor doese not dismiss the case; the court

22

does.

And that didn't happen until March.

23

And again --

24

QUESTION:

25

Are you aware of any cases of this

kind in which the court has imposed a condition relating

to this problem?

MS. MILLETT:

I don't want to say it doesn't in

case we get to some situation where we might want to try,

but it doesn't seem to -- clearly to allow that and I

8

think it would be extraordinary reading of the Bankruptcy

9

Code to think that a court can impose, as a condition on a

10

voluntary dismissal that's entirely within the discretion

11

of the debtor to seek.

imposed on the person who wants to enforce their claim.

10

And that isn't going to change from case to case, as in

11

Bowen v. City of New York where this Court again applied a

12

class-wide rule of tolling because the Government's

13

actions with the Social Security plaintiffs in that case

14

had been the same.
QUESTION:

16

Your argument doesn't hinge on bad

faith, anyway, as I understand it.

17

MS. MILLETT:

QUESTION:

No.

No, it doesn't.

You -- you assert that -- that

19

without the tolling, we would frustrate Congress' intent

20

even where there has been no bad faith, that Congress

21

would not have intended where there's good faith to give

22

the person an added -- an added couple of years of -- of

23

no taxes.

MS. MILLETT:

Of no taxes or to get out of

paying their taxes or to relegate the Government to this

But uniform rules have been applied by this

Court when that circumstance doesn't change, and in this

case for purposes of equitable tolling, what's not going

to change is that the Government hasn't had the time

That's going to be the

Beyond that, amount of tax liability shouldn't
matter.

That's a judgment for -- for Congress and the

10

Government to take.

It's not -- it shouldn't -- equitable

11

tolling shouldn't turn upon that, and the bad faith or

12

good faith of the taxpayer wouldn't be determinative.

13

And in that regard, I think it's important to

14

keep in mind that if we had a test where we had to show

15

bad faith in every one of these cases, again we're talking

16

about an enormous volume of bankruptcy cases.

17

showing -- in those -- in those circuits where they have

18

applied this sort of case-by-case equitable tolling, the

19

Government has had to be very selective in which cases it

decides to make that showing, giving a lot of people a

pass on taxes.

is not what the purpose of the Bankruptcy Code is for.

QUESTION:

Ms. Millett, would you remind me?

I

1

think that Congress wanted the Government to have 3 years,

2

and that was a cutting back on what the Government had

3

before.

Right?

4

MS. MILLETT:

5

QUESTION:

6

We're now giving you 3 years.

7

Absolutely.

They said, we gave you too much.

MS. MILLETT:

Absolutely, and that's why I think

8

it -- it's extraordinary to think that Congress --

9

Congress went to the steps that you would have to decide,

10

if you decide this is not a collection period and akin to

11

a statute of limitations, because prior to 1966, these tax

12

claims, regardless of age, were all entitled to priority

13

and were all nondischargeable.

14

1966 was decide it was going to balance competing

15

interests within the bankruptcy process and condition the

16

Government's entitlement to that special status on its

17

diligent enforcement of those tax claims.

18

it's like a statute of limitations.

19

And what Congress did in

And that is why

But to hold otherwise is to say that what

20

Congress went to in 1966 was a situation where everything

21

was protected to where nothing is protected except at the

22

sole discretion and choice of the debtor proceeding in

23

bankruptcy.

24

We can't choose our -- we can't choose our debtors, and we

25

will -- and they have the entire authority to prevent any

of claims that arose before they filed bankruptcy.

3

have bankruptcy proceedings that go on for more than 3

4

years, as many do, this -- this rule would apply to tax

5

claims that arose while the case was in bankruptcy and the

6

3 years ran.

7

And we're not just talking about enforcement
If you

And that in fact is what has happened in a case

8

we have pending in the Fifth Circuit.

If they can

9

discharge not just the things that you may have had a few

10

months before -- or a year before the bankruptcy was

11

filed, tax claims that we have never had a millisecond

12

outside the freedom of the automatic stay to enforce will

13

be extinguished, not because of anything the Government

14

did or did not do, but solely because of the procedural

15

steps taken by the debtor in Bankruptcy Court.
And we think it's extraordinary to think that

16
17

that's what Congress did and intended to do in 1966.

18

-- it went for that transformation.

19

to be construed to assume that Congress would imperil

State or Federal revenues.
QUESTION:

really is whether -- assume we know exactly what Congress

MS. MILLETT:

particularly in the context of traditional equity courts

appropriate.
