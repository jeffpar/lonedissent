ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAUFER

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. SCHNAUFER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

12

please the Court:

13

simple principle that a federal statute requires that an

14

attorney fee be contingent on success in litigation, that

15

when the court determines an attorney fee pursuant to that

16

statute, an attorney fee should reflect the contingent

17

nature of the fee, thus because 406(b) requires a

18

contingent fee in Social Security cases, when the district

19

court determined the reasonable fee pursuant to 406(b)

20

that attorney fee must reflect the contingent nature of

21

the fee.

22

We are asking this Court to recognize a

QUESTION:

Let me ask you a question about the

23

limits of the extent of the prohibition, whatever is in

24

406(b).

25

question where the attorney is seeking a recovery out of

I think that can be read to deal only with the

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the plaintiff's recovery.

2

MR. SCHNAUFER:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it's

3

possible to interpret the statute in a way that would not

4

criminalize charging a claimant a noncontingent fee,

5

however the existing practice in the bar is to take it as

6

prohibiting charging a noncontingent fee?

7

QUESTION:

Well, there anything more

8

authoritative as the existing practice of the bar that

9

would lead to that conclusion?

10

MR. SCHNAUFER:

I would direct the Court's

11

attention to the 406(b)(2) where it sets forth the

12

criminal penalties for violation of the statute.

13

only one appellate court to address whether or not a

14

noncontingent fee may be charged as the third circuit in

15

Coup, but it doesn't reach the issue.

16

court in Hutchinson cited in the amicus brief from the

17

claimants representatives addresses that.

18

No.

There is

Also one district

I think even if the statute did not

19

require a contingent fee when there was no judgment

20

favorable to the plaintiff, I believe that the vast

21

majority of claimants would voluntarily choose to enter

22

into contingent fee agreements.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. SCHNAUFER:

25

Because that's how they get counsel?
Absolutely.

So even if the

statute didn't criminalize charging a noncontingent fee,

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this would be the voluntary selection of the vast majority

2

of --

3

QUESTION:

Well, if the statute, 406(b) reads

4

as though when there is a judgment favorable to the

5

claimant, the court may allow a reasonable fee.

6

apparently determine that fee any way it saw fit?

And could

7

MR. SCHNAUFER:

8

in Christenberg Garments is relevant.

9

addresses whether the term, whether the court may award

I believe this Court's decision
That case also

10

attorney fees interpreting that the court did, the

11

attorney matter wasn't up to the court, that the court

12

would generally award the attorney fee in that fee

13

shifting context.

14

different --

15

So yes, there are situations in which a

QUESTION:

Well, it suggests perhaps that the

16

court would allow a fee, but it seems open-ended that it

17

will allow the court to determine the fee any way it wants

18

on the lodestar method or via, by some other method.

19

MR. SCHNAUFER:

Justice O'Connor, I believe

20

the statute should be interpreted relative to the legal

21

context in which it was enacted in 1965, which additional

22

role of state courts rule on contingent fee agreements was

23

to decide where the agreed upon amount between the parties

24

was excessive or abusive.

25

QUESTION:

That wasn't personal to any

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

statutory mandate, was it?

2

supervisory power of the courts over fees?

3

MR. SCHNAUFER:

Wasn't that that just the

Yes, the federal courts in the

4

early '60s, in 1965, doubted whether they even had the

5

authority to rule on the appropriateness of a contingent

6

fee.

7

406(b) so the court, the district court would determine

8

the reasonableness of a 406(b) fee.

Congress clarified that by specifically providing

9

QUESTION:

Well, you think the language of the

10

statute requires a contingent fee?

11

can be a contingent fee?

12

I believe that the --

MR. SCHNAUFER:

At only reasonable fee

That any attorney fee has to be

13

contingent on success in the litigation that could be

14

different fee agreements.

15

agree to charge or to pay his or her attorney a flat fee

16

contingent on success in litigation or a specific hourly

17

fee contingent on success in the litigation or for

18

example, a complex formula based on the success in

19

litigation.

For example, a plaintiff may

20

But the attorney fee in our view --

21

QUESTION:

But you think that the implication

22

of this statute is that the court has to base it on the

23

agreement of the attorney and the attorney's client?

24
25

MR. SCHNAUFER:

Yes.

I believe the relevant

inquiry --

QUESTION:

Because it done say that.

I think

2

you are reading something in that isn't there.

3

are basing that on practice of lawyers at the time or

4

something?

5

MR. SCHNAUFER:

And you

But, Justice O'Connor.

I

6

believe that clearly in 1965, Congress could not have

7

intended to adopt for this statute the lodestar method

8

given that the lodestar method had not been invented until

9

a decade or so later and not really adopted by this Court

10
11

until its decision in -QUESTION:

Well, before lodestar, there were

12

other descriptions for reasonable fees that depended on

13

hours, degree of difficulty, etcetera etc.

14

lawyers did that for decades.

15

MR. SCHNAUFER:

Yes.

I mean,

Yes, Justice Kennedy, and

16

when a court was involved, the question would be whether

17

the agreed upon fee is reasonable or unreasonable, the

18

court would not itself in the context when there was an

19

existing fee, fee agreement determine what it felt was the

20

most appropriate fee, so the primary question when there

21

is a fee agreement and a fee request is whether the fee

22

request, the agreed upon fee is reasonable.

23

QUESTION:

I think this is a very difficult

24

case because either way, we are going to be, I mean on

25

which circuits involved, we are going to be upsetting

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

standard arrangements, contingent fees in some cases.

2

this case, in the Ninth Circuit, are you saying that the

3

fee, the fee the Ninth Circuit set was not reasonable?

4

MR. SCHNAUFER:

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

In

For

5

several reasons the attorney fee that the district courts

6

in Ninth Circuit set was not reasonable.

7

foremost, the district courts did not address the primary

8

question whether the agreed upon fee was a reasonable fee.

9

Second, the district court who decided, who ordered the

First and

10

fees in Gisbrecht, Miller and Sandine, did not take into

11

account, did not have the attorney fees reflect the

12

contingent nature of the fee.

13

in all three cases noncontingent hourly rates,

14

noncontingent fees when by law, the attorney fee must be

15

contingent on success.

16

QUESTION:

The district courts awarded

Well, but, of course, that assumes

17

that you are correct here.

18

fair compensation, was this unfair compensation?

19

MR. SCHNAUFER:

20

QUESTION:

21

But based on a standard of

Yes.

Quite without reference to your

statutory argument?

22

MR. SCHNAUFER:

Yes.

Because when an attorney

23

fee is contingent on success in the litigation, the

24

attorney fee should reflect the contingent nature of the

25

fee.

In this case, even if there were not a prohibition

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

on charging noncontingent fee, the parties had freely

2

contracted that the attorney would be paid more taking

3

into account the risk of loss.

4

QUESTION:

But it seems to me you have got to

5

get back to the statute and say why the statute should be

6

read the way you want it to.

7

situation event or of a contingent fee say in a personal

8

injury case which the court may have supervision over in

9

the general sense.

This isn't an ordinary

Here the court doesn't say that the

10

attorney shall enter into an agreement and the court shall

11

enforce it.

12

part of its judgment a reasonable fee for such

13

representation.

14

and say why you think that the amount of the contingencies

15

specified in your contract is the one that the court has

16

to follow.

17

It says the court may determine and allow as

I think you have got to build from that

MR. SCHNAUFER:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe

18

that the practice before 1965 is relevant.

19

entering into contingent fee agreements with their clients

20

to represent full representation in civil actions.

21

Congress in an act in 406(b), did not void those

22

agreements, did not say that attorneys should not charge a

23

contingent fee, but instead, chose to regulate the

24

contingent fee agreements.

25

Attorneys were

If Congress had, if Congress had intended to

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

prohibit attorneys from engaging, from making contingent

2

fee agreements with their clients, force representation in

3

federal court, Congress really could have said so.

4

think we have cited.

5

QUESTION:

6

But it doesn't say anything in

(b)(1)(a) about contingent fees, does it?

7

MR. SCHNAUFER:

No.

(B)(1)(a) reflects that

8

the attorney be must be contingent upon a favorable

9

judgment.

Well, if you get a favorable

judgment --

14

MR. SCHNAUFER:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SCHNAUFER:

Right.

You can get a fee.
Yes.

Which isn't quite the same thing.
We believe that the purpose of

17

the statute expressed by Congress is fully implemented by

18

our view.

19

QUESTION:

Let me -- I'm having trouble

20

following your argument.

21

using the words differently than apparently you are.

22

understand we are in a universe where you are only going

23

to get paid under this statute if you win.

24

about that.

MR. SCHNAUFER:

And one reason is because I am
I

Am I right

Yes.

1
2

QUESTION:

All right, so we all assume in that

sense every fee is contingent.

3

MR. SCHNAUFER:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

But then I thought we were trying to

5

distinguish within that universe between some circuits

6

that say the way we should calculate that is by looking to

7

what they call the lodestar, and other circuits that say

8

the way we calculate it is we look to the agreement and if

9

the agreement is for 25 percent of the recovery, that's

10

where we start.

Am I right?

11

MR. SCHNAUFER:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice --

All right.

Now what is it that we

13

are trying to decide?

14

what is it that you see us trying to decide within that

15

universe?

16

Are we trying to decide whether --

MR. SCHNAUFER:

Well, there are significant

17

variations of the lodestar method.

18

proposes that the lodestar method be the lodestar method

19

from the fee shifting context, not taking into account the

20

contingent nature.

21

QUESTION:

All right.

The government now

As far as I can see, the

22

Ninth Circuit says we start with the lodestar, but then it

23

can be adjusted for 12 factors.

24

what I would call the contingent fee, namely, the one 25

25

percent of the judgment written into the contract which is

Number six of which is

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

what I will use the word contingent to refer to, and so

2

you have the Ninth Circuit says first the lodestar

3

adjusted for that, and then some other circuits say first

4

start with 25 percent contingency, but adjust it if that

5

isn't reasonable.

6

am I right?

Now, that's how I was seeing it.

7

Correct me if I'm not.

8

MR. SCHNAUFER:

9

Now,

Justice, I believe there are

variations.

10

QUESTION:

11

those are the two basic things.

12

those two basic things, what is it you want us to say.

13

And there are some variations, but

MR. SCHNAUFER:

All right.

As between

We ask the court to, to specify

14

that when a district court determines a reasonable fee

15

under 406(b) it should start by asking first the question

16

what is the agreed upon amount and is the agreed upon

17

amount --

18

QUESTION:

Okay.

You said circuits start with

19

the 25 percent contract and adjust, rather than the

20

circuits that say start with the lodestar and adjust.

21

Okay.

22

what you want rather than letting the Ninth Circuit free

23

to do it the way it wants?

24
25

And the statute says may.

MR. SCHNAUFER:

And now why should we do

I believe, Justice Breyer, that

there could be possible, you could allow different

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

circuits to do things in different ways, but the interest

2

is in uniform federal law.

3

traditional method of determining contingent fee is best

4

served, best serves the purpose of the act.

5

lodestar calculation is generally an expensive,

6

time-consuming endeavor best suited to complex litigation.

7

Social Security cases only take generally 30, 40 or 50

8

hours to accomplish.

9

I believe that the method, the

Hence the

If attorney fee litigation using, trying to

10

proof up the Hensley hourly rate is required, then

11

attorneys will have to spend five, maybe 10, in this case

12

much more hours trying to collect a compensatory fee.

QUESTION:

Mr. Schnaufer, can I ask you this

14

question?

prescribe a maximum fee.

that.

As I understand it, 406(a)provides that for

Is -- is -- am I correct in

Yes.

Justice Scalia.

So the agency sets a fee and it

20

doesn't matter what the parties have agreed to before the

21

agency.

22

says this is the maximum fee.

adopt a totally different regime for representation before

the courts?

but before the courts basically what governs is your

2

agreement with the lawyer.

3

that?

I don't know why they would do

4

MR. SCHNAUFER:

5

the statute does not say.

6

require the agency to ignore an agreement between a

7

plaintiff or a claimant and his or her attorney when

8

determining a fee for administrative work.

9

you take a look at the regulations --

10

QUESTION:

Justice Scalia, I believe that
That the statute does not

In fact, if

Well, it requires them to ignore it

11

if it goes beyond what the agency determines is the

12

maximum amount that ought to be charged.

13

MR. SCHNAUFER:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

In that

14

way 406(b) and 406(a) are the same.

15

any agreement between an attorney and the Social Security

16

claimant is inconsistent with the statute provision that

17

agreement is void.

18

To the extent that

The long-standing provision --

QUESTION:

What about the provision at the

administrative level that does refer to an agreement?

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Yes.

It controls with a cap of $4,000 at

the agency level.
MR. SCHNAUFER:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

The

statute there is elucidative of Congress' acknowledgment

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

and lass the agency's acknowledgment of the capacity of

2

Social Security claimants to contract with their attorneys

3

for representation in federal court.

4

specifically for the court to adopt the presumption, the

5

conclusive presumption in 406(a)(2), instead, we maintain

6

that the attorney has the ability, has the burden as the

7

fee applicant to establish the reasonableness of the fee.

8

That is somewhat different than the more lenient rules of

9

406(a)(2).

We are not asking

That's an express scheme for filing of

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

believe that Congress does, has addressed specifically on

14

occasion when a court, when the court should look to an

15

agreement or the agency should look to the agreement to

16

determine a reasonable fee.

17

the context of the legal context in 1965, Congress would

18

have understood that a district court determining a

19

reasonable fee for representation in court for the --

So you are saying this is a more --

Yes, but with important

differences.

The 406(a)(2) administrative fees creates a

10

are saying that the attorney has the burden under 406(b)

to prove the reasonableness of the fee.

the attorney will not request the full agreed upon fee but

Of course, it's important in many cases

For example, in the case of Anderson that this

believe the attorneys have a strong interest in not

QUESTION:

If you place an objection to the

4

lodestar method, you said this becomes a litigation that

5

is embarrassingly longer than the litigation over the

6

client itself.

7

MR. SCHNAUFER:

Justice Ginsburg, our objection

8

to the lodestar method depends on how you, what you mean

9

by the lodestar method.

There is a lodestar method using

10

the fee shifting context that is a noncontingent fee.

11

There is also a lodestar method that may allow enhancement

12

for contingency and that would be a fee-shifting context.

13

QUESTION:

The district court here relied on

14

the bar fees in the Portland area, didn't it, for lawyers

15

that have been practicing a certain amount of time?

16

MR. SCHNAUFER:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

The

17

hourly rates used were established as noncontingent hourly

18

rates however since the attorney services were contingent

19

on success, an attorney fee awarded at that rate would not

20

be fully compensatory.

21

contingent on success, the attorney fee, a reasonable

22

attorney fee should reflect the contingent nature.

23

QUESTION:

That when an attorney fee is

Well, every fee is in a sense

24

contingent on success.

25

you don't charge the same amount as if you win the

lawsuit, whether or not the fee agreement is contingent?

2

MR. SCHNAUFER:

Yes.

Mr. Chief Justice.

In

3

this case, the government maintained that $125 for one

4

attorney was the appropriate reasonable noncontingent

5

hourly rate, however, the government also concedes that

6

the class-based risk of loss in these cases is two out of

7

three.

8

that 1/3 of Social Security plaintiffs end up receiving

9

past due benefits and so on average, an attorney will

10

receive 1/3 of that noncontingent hourly rate if that

11

noncontingent hourly rate is all the compensation that the

12

attorney can obtain.

13

QUESTION:

We have set forth agency's own statistics showing

Mr. Schnaufer, here's my problem

The

10

hourly rate was $125 per attorney.

11

does not dispute that the risk of loss is one in three and

12

so a fully compensatory hourly rate would multiply that

13

hourly rate times a three multiplier for $375 an hour.

14

However, in these cases, the actual, the 25 percent cap

15

came in, would have been met at $280, $190 and roughly

16

$270.

successful Social Security claims.

23

sets a kept, a contingent fee of no more than 25 percent.

One is that it sets an upper bound of a reasonable fee

which is 25 percent but more precisely

QUESTION:

And the statute has two provisions.

That does not suggest that there can

It does not necessarily suggest

that, no.

question as Justice Breyer posed was more an a policy

9

level, why should this Court adopt a rule that would allow

10

those kinds of enhancements and I think one of the reasons

11

why that's inappropriate in this context is because the

12

purpose here is not just to encourage lawyers to take

13

these cases, which was the case in the fee-shifting

14

statutes where this Court said enhancements aren't

15

necessary.

16

it would be particularly inappropriate --

17

What we are talking -- what I think the

MR. SALMONS:

Would that

Your Honor, that would certainly

be a one way to interpret a statute that I think on the

text of the statute there is nothing that would prohibit

15

I think you would agree that's

MR. SALMONS:

I do agree that's desirable, but

I think the lodestar method is the best way to could that.
QUESTION:

And I'm just wondering if what I

16

propose to be a sufficient compliance with the lodestar

17

method to satisfy the government?

18

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, I think it would

19

largely be in compliance with lodestar method, although

20

not under this Court's decision in Dague which has

21

prohibited the consideration of contingency enhancements.

22

QUESTION:

Did that, did that prohibition of

23

contingency enhancements apply in the context such as this

24

where it was only legally possible to charge when you win?

25

MR. SALMONS:

No, Your Honor, that was not the

context of 1988.

QUESTION:

Might not that make a difference?

3

It's one thing to say well, if you don't, if you don't

charge anything for your losing cases, that's your

5

problem.

7

plaintiff pay for the, for the two who you lost.

you are in a different context where the only time you can

get fees by law is where you win, would we have to pay,

10
11

You ought to charge.

And we are not going to

But when

would we have to adopt the same rule?
MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, I think this Court

12

should adopt the same rule and it's because the reasons

13

this Court adopted the rule that it did in the context of

14

fee-shifting statutes was not because there was still some

15

possibility that lawyers could negotiate fees even that

16

won on a contingent basis.

17

QUESTION:

What's the government's position,

supposing one of the Social Security lawyers has a very

wealthy client who feels he is entitled to Social Security

as a course he is just like everybody else.

am determined to get that Social Security.

QUESTION:

3

He doesn't want to get it out of the

He says I'll bill you for it afterwards.

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, the commissioner does

4

interpret 406(b) to require only contingent fees, that it

5

prohibits a lawyer from charging fees when there is no

6

award of back benefits.

7

QUESTION:

A maximum wouldn't make any sense

8

otherwise.

I mean, the maximum is 25 percent of the back

9

pay award.

If there is no back pay award, you can charge

10

as much as you like.

11

I mean, that's strange.

MR. SALMONS:

We think that in light of, of the

12

terms of 406(b), its purpose is in the structure with,

13

with the provision that would make it in fact a crime to

14

charge more.

15

that only fees that have been authorized by a court can be

16

charged.

17

But the best way to read that is to require

QUESTION:

Has the commission ever issued an

18

opinion to that effect?

19

MR. SALMONS:

No, Your Honor.

There is no

20

regulation that simply addresses that.

21

you, it is not an issue that has really come up because

22

lawyers as the record here again reflects, have a

23

universal practice of entering into fee agreements that

24

say 25 percent contingency at the statutory maximum and

25

their contingent fees so it's just not an issue that comes

QUESTION:

So the statute says all fees are

3

contingent and the government says there can be no

4

contingent fees?

5

That's where we are in this case?

MR. SALMONS:

No, Your Honor.

The statute says

the relevant language of the statute says the courts will

determine a reasonable fee, and we --

But all fees are contingent on

think, of what the term contingent fee means.

that the lawyer is going to recover is if the plaintiff

guess benefits, is that right?

Nobody gets

At least the secretaries interpreted

MR. SALMONS:

16

QUESTION:

That is correct.

Okay.

And then the question is

17

what's, what this provision requires.

18

that I had to this picture is well, in tort litigation,

19

the standard is a third of the recovery.

20

here, why isn't a quarter of the recovery eminently

21

reasonable considering as was pointed out that the

22

recovery comes only out of the past benefits.

23

nothing out of the future benefits the person is going to

24

get.

25

It doesn't just make a whole lot of sense instead of

One just reaction

And why isn't

No --

So what is it about the 25 percent of past benefits?

1

engaging in what we know from this very case, we'll take

2

as much time as the calculation, as the dispute over the

3

benefits themselves.

4

took as long as the litigation over the claimant's right

5

to benefits.

6

The litigation here over the fees

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, let me if I may

7

address your last point first.

8

commissioner's experience with the lodestar method in the

9

numerous circuits that apply it is not that it is

That is to say that the

10

difficult to apply, but keep in mind, Your Honors, that in

11

most of these cases, the lawyers are also seeking EAJA

12

fees and so the very same court that's going to consider

13

the 406(b) fee claim has already undertaken a lodestar

14

analysis to determine a reasonable number of hours and

15

then the rate is determined by EAJA, but the

16

commissioner's experience is that the lodestar method is

17

not difficult to apply and in the vast majority of cases,

18

certainly in most circuits, the commissioner doesn't

19

object to most of the fee claims because they are

20

reasonable.

21

reasonable rates are in the relevant prevailing markets.

22

The courts have determined standards for what

QUESTION:

You mentioned EAJA.

One of the

23

problems that I have with that analogy is it works out

24

here that you get EAJA is just about this it.

25

lawyers got what, what EAJA permitted.

These three

And then

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

fee-shifting statutes generally you get from the Defendant

2

what EAJA allows you, but then you can have, you can

3

recover more from your own client.

4

EAJA is it and it seems to me something unfair about that.

5

MR. SALMONS:

Here it works out that

Your Honor, I think the only

6

thing unfair in that sense is that Congress here has

7

determined that the market for legal services in the

8

Social Security context was failing to carry out the

9

purposes of the Social Security Act, and that lawyers had

10

unequal bargaining power and were charging inordinately

11

large contingency fees --

12

QUESTION:

But those were the days you were

13

talking about 50 percent contingent fees so Congress cut

14

it back to 25, so why -- what --

15

MR. SALMONS:

16

QUESTION:

That's correct.

What -- you just said well, 25 not

17

in every case, maybe only work two hours, it would be

18

unreasonable, but instead of having the judge and the

19

lawyers go through this whole thing, I mean, EAJA is

20

available only if the government's position was not

21

substantially justified, right?

22

MR. SALMONS:

It's not automatic.

That's correct.

That's correct.

23

It's a standard that course seem to find on a regular

24

basis in these cases, but that is the standard.

25

QUESTION:

Does the government -- I don't know

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

how it works, but when someone is seeking benefits from

2

the government, government has prevailed all through the

3

agency, loses in court, does the government just sort of

4

concede that the government's position was not

5

substantially justified?

6

MR. SALMONS:

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

I

7

think the government lawyers in each case would look at

8

the prevailing circuit law or, of the jurisdiction, would

9

look at the facts of the case and make the determination.

10

In most of these cases, EAJA fees seem to be awarded and

11

the resolution of those fees doesn't take a lot of time.

12

QUESTION:

Well, shouldn't there about, you say

13

you look at the law of the particular circuit.

14

think that a concept like was the government's position

15

substantially justified shouldn't be whatever it means in,

16

in 12 different appellate courts.

17

MR. SALMONS:

I would

My point, Your Honor, is just one

18

of the things I think that's keeping, is important to keep

19

in mind in these cases is that they, by their nature, tend

20

to be very routine and so both in terms of awarding EAJA

21

fees and in terms of awarding 406(b) fees, it is not very

22

difficult for courts to develop practices in these cases

23

that, that result in a very expedited process, and that in

24

fact, that is, that is the way the lodestar method is

25

applied and I, and it seems to me, Your Honors, that the

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

alternative that's being proposed would largely frustrate

2

the purpose that Justice Stevens was identifying of the

3

need for some sort of expedited procedures here.

4

point to four additional factors that aren't lodestar

5

factors that they think courts should take into account.

6

They

Some of the contingency circuits who have

7

adopted some modified contingency rule have added

8

additional factors, including requiring courts to ask

9

whether the claimants had been notified that there were

10

other options other than the 25 percent contingent fee

11

which under the facts of this case we were told the

12

lawyers would never do.

13

QUESTION:

Does the government have any

14

statistics as to how often an award of attorneys fees by a

15

district judge is appealed to the Court of Appeals?

16
17

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, that is, in the

context of 406(b) cases?

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. SALMONS:

Yes.
There are no -- the agency does

20

not specifically keep statistics on that, although I did

21

discuss that with the relevant agency personnel and was

22

informed that in fact the agency very rarely seeks an

23

appeal unless the case involves some broader legal

24

principle that the agency determines is important to

25

litigation.

QUESTION:

Mr. Salmons, another question of

statistics.

challenged that.

8

is something that is really outrageous practice going on

9

and there is a need to enhance for that contingency.

We have had the statistic that only one out
And I take it you have not

That's one of the arguments that there

What

10

I want to ask is are there any, is there any evidence,

11

statistical or otherwise, to explain why the rate is only

12

one win out of three cases?

13

One reason might be that, or one description

14

might be that virtually all lawyers who take these cases

15

in fact have the experience of losing two for every one.

16

But another explanation might be that lawyers who can tell

17

the difference between a good case and a bad case win at a

18

very high rate, and that a lot of young lawyers who don't

19

have access to many clients are willing to take long shots

20

and that when you average those two together, you bet the

21

one win out of three cases.

22

Do we know, do we know which possible

23

description is correct or whether there is some third

24

description that explains the one in three?

25

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, I'm not aware of any

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

statistical or other information that's directly on point,

2

although I could think it is important to keep in mind

3

that the standards of review among other things have a lot

4

to do with the outcome of these cases, and that, and that

5

the general statistics that the courts provide through,

6

for example, the federal judiciary home page that tracks

7

different types of cases in different circuits, for

8

example, shows that there has been dramatic increases in

9

the number of Title II disability lawsuits that are filed

10

initially in district courts between the period of 1990 to

11

2000.

12

In fact, that they have tripled.
QUESTION:

Does that have anything to do with

13

what the rate is because these are all cases that lost at

14

the administrative level, right?

15

MR. SALMONS:

16

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Is there any, any showing that maybe

17

in the prior period, there were more cases winning at the

18

administrative level, therefore fewer getting into the

19

court?

20

MR. SALMONS:

Not that I have seen.

In fact,

21

Your Honor, the numbers that I have seen suggest that the

22

percentage of cases that win before the agency has been

23

relatively consistent.

QUESTION:

Is this the result of those, of

those jurisdictions that have allowed contingency to be
considered?
MR. SALMONS:

No.

Not at all.

Your Honor.

12

The point I was trying to make is that there aren't any

13

hard statistics that show how the different legal rules

have having an effect on litigants in this context, but

that's the point I was trying to make, Your Honor.

21

all that we can tell is that one, the commissioner has not

for over 10 years.

MR. SALMONS:

That is certainly an option that
The government's position is that

if the Court is going to address the issue of what

11

standards should be applied, that the best way for this

13

the best method, and that includes --

But that is a pretty big swing if

It varied in the, in the cases.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

I think it was under 10 percent.

2

MR. SALMONS:

I think one way to sort of try

3

and track that is that what the claimants lawyers in these

4

cases did was because they recognized they were in a

5

lodestar circuit, they had, they kept the same number of

6

reasonable hours they would use for their EAJA fees which

7

the government did not contest and then they just divided

8

that by the 25 percent figure and came up with an hourly

9

rate.

10

So the hourly rates they sought in these cases

ranged from around $180 an hour to nearly $300 an hour.

QUESTION:

But those were chopped down by the

MR. SALMONS:

That's why I think you have to

Your Honor, let me make two

4

points very quickly.

5

this statute, it recognized not only that lawyers were

6

charging an inordinately large percentage in terms of

7

their contingency fees, but there was an inherent problem

8

with contingency fees because in this context they do not

9

track the value, a reasonable value of legal services.

One is that when Congress enacted

10

They turn unnecessarily on factors such as the number of

11

dependents and the amount of delay that it takes in order

12

to get the benefits over which time the benefits continued

13

to accrue which just has no bearing whatsoever on the

14

amount, the value of the legal services provider.

kind of statute when it wants to.

It has not done so here.

7

make, Your Honor, is that, is that these cases are, as

8

both sides seem to agree, are somewhat unique in that they

9

generally require a very low number of hours.

Congress knows how to write that
It did so in 406(a)(2).

Another point I would like to

They don't

10

require the same kinds of risk undertaken by the lawyers

11

as other contingent fee cases do.

QUESTION:

Well, if that's so then the judge in

13

all the circuits that follow the contingent method would

14

reduce the award.

15

start with the lodestar enhance.

16

going to start with the contingent fee reduce it.

17

the simpler is the contingent fee reduce it.

frankly you don't have to go into the hours.

I disagree, Your Honor, because

of the court's experience, the lodestar method, I think

that's the most efficient way for courts to determine the

fee.

QUESTION:

Beyond the record, do you have any

statistics on how often contingent fees are reduced in the

contingency circuits?

MR. SALMONS:

I do not, Your Honor.

One other thing that I think --

QUESTION:

I do not.

Do you have any sort of egregious

examples where there was a lot of delay in those circuits

just to build up the recovery?

a problem for the agency anywhere?

7

MR. SALMONS:

Has that turned out to be

Your Honor, the agency has not

8

experienced any particular problem under either of these

9

standards.

We do think that the lodestar method as this

10

Court announced it in Dague is the best way to effectuate

11

Congress' intent under the purposes of this statute.

12

think it's important to keep in mind that Congress has

13

already provided a mechanism to ensure adequate counsel

14

here, and that is the payment out of the back benefit

awards directly to the lawyer.

That's different than in

So that Congress was concerned with the need to

18

encourage counsel and it provided a provision to do that.

19

It struck the balance, and then it requires the courts to

20

determine the reasonable fee in each case based on a fair

21

value of the legal services provided and this Court has

22

long held that there is a strong presumption that when

23

Congress says courts determine a reasonable fee, Congress

24

means the lodestar method.

25

If the lodestar method --

Your Honor, courts used a variety

of standards before as they did under other fee statutes.

8

The fact that the lodestar method wasn't fully developed

9

didn't prevent this Court from adopting it under the Civil

10

Rights Act of 1964, for example, but prior to the adoption

11

of the lodestar method, it's not the case the courts were

routinely deferring to the fee contracts.

MR. SCHNAUFER:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

position.

preferable method.
