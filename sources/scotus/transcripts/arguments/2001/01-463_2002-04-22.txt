ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MS. O'CONNOR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is about the authority of the

11

Commissioner of Internal Revenue to assess FICA taxes that

Congress has imposed on employers.

4

Which section is this, Ms. O'Connor?

MS. O'CONNOR:

Section 3111 at page 55a of our

appendix to the petition.

5

QUESTION:

Thank you.

6

MS. O'CONNOR:

This is the tax that imposes --

7

this is the provision that imposes a tax on the wages

8

employers pay or are deemed to have paid their employees.

9

The question this case presents is how the

10

commissioner carries out his obligation under 6201 to

11

assess the tax that is imposed by section 3111.

12

is --

13

QUESTION:

The tax

Ms. O'Connor, let me tell you what

14

troubles me a little about the Government's position in

15

the case, and I hope you will address this.

16

employer ever challenge effectively an assessment made

17

under the position that you approach, because the normal

18

burden of proof in a tax refund case normally requires the

19

employer to show exactly how much money was owed, and I

20

don't see how that would work in this context.

21

MS. O'CONNOR:

Exactly, Your Honor.

How can an

The

22

Congress has recognized the difficulty that employers have

23

in this regard, and that is the reason there are several

24

of the other sections that we will discussing this

25

morning.

Section 6205, for example, is mentioned in your

and have no interest assessed.

4

provision, and it relates specifically to the complexity

5

of employment taxes and their administration.

6

That is a provision that permits employers on

QUESTION:

That's a very unusual

Well, would that error ever be

7

anything more than a disparity between what the employee

8

reported and what the employer reported?

9

MS. O'CONNOR:

10

QUESTION:

Would what, Your Honor?

How -- I mean, the error that that

11

section -- I'm wondering what the error is that that

12

section contemplates, and I can see it's application,

13

let's say, if the employer simply added up the employee's

14

reports wrong and got the wrong figure.

15

circumstances would it apply short of the moment at which

16

the Government makes the assessment which is in question

17

here?

18

MS. O'CONNOR:

Under what other

It could also apply just -- and

19

6205 is not specific to restaurants or food or beverage

20

establishments or tips at all, because another common

21

error that employers can sometimes make is

22

mischaracterizing a worker as an independent contractor,

23

for example, and upon determining later that the person is

24

actually an employee and they should be withholding

MS. O'CONNOR:
QUESTION:

That's right, Your Honor.

And I'll assume for the sake of the

question that a given employer has done that.

12

MS. O'CONNOR:

13

QUESTION:

Mm-hmm.

I also assume that if you are

14

correct, that employer has this possibility hanging over

15

it that the IRS is going to make this kind of an

16

assessment.

17

MS. O'CONNOR:

18

QUESTION:

That --

Is there any -- my question is, is

19

there any way that the employer can anticipate this kind

20

of an assessment in order at least to avoid the interest

21

running under this section?

22

MS. O'CONNOR:

Absolutely.

There are many

23

different ways, Your Honor, and this case provides a very

24

good example.

monthly basis to employers.

Employees are required to report on a
You can see from the forms

1

8027, which are at pages 38 and 39 of the joint appendix,

2

those are the forms that this restaurant filed for 1991

3

and 1992.

4

QUESTION:

5

MS. O'CONNOR:

6

And they were all correct, I take it.
Right, those forms were

absolutely correct.

7

You will also note at the top of the page it

8

says that it is an information report, because this is

9

information that Congress has required food and beverage

10

establishments to provide to the Internal Revenue Service

11

exactly for a purpose such as this.

12

Now, the annual -- the information report at

13

pages 38 and 39 is an annual report that the food and

14

beverage establishment provides to the Internal Revenue

15

Service, but employees provide reports to employers at

16

least monthly.

17

percent of the sales of this restaurant were paid for by

18

credit card, so every single month this restaurant could

19

have compared the tips that employees were reporting with

20

the tips that they saw were being charged on credit cards,

21

and as any business owner would do when faced with a

22

liability that could occur down the road, you're going to

23

set up a reserve for it.

24
25

You will see on the forms 8027 that 90

You know you have got your annual insurance

You start setting aside for it.

1

QUESTION:

He may set up -- the employer may set

2

up a reserve, but as I understand it the employer is not

3

obligated, in effect, to withhold upon himself, is not

4

obligated to pay the tax on it until the assessment comes,

5

because under the IRS' instructions the employer pays the

6

tax on the amounts reported to the employer even if he

7

knows they're wrong.

8
9

MS. O'CONNOR:

That's exactly right, and that's

another indication of the fact that Congress realized that

10

this was going to be a difficult provision for employers

11

to enact.

12

QUESTION:

Well, what would he do --

13

MS. O'CONNOR:

14

QUESTION:

31 --

What would he do to anticipate it?

15

Would he say, I'm paying you another $10,000, I don't

16

happen to owe you that in tax now, I paid what the law

17

requires me to pay, and you haven't assessed anything

18

else, but here's another $10,000?

19

you're anticipating?

20

MS. O'CONNOR:

I mean, is that what

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

fact, it is the rare taxpayer who seeks to pay his tax

22

before it's called for.

23

(Laughter.)

QUESTION:

25

In

All right, then how does the taxpayer

take advantage of the provision that allows him to make a

correction and avoid the interest in this case?

2

MS. O'CONNOR:

Well, one of the things that is

3

somewhat troublesome about some of the briefs in front of

4

you from the other side is that the other side is looking

5

at this as though it was a penalty, and it's not a

6

penalty, it's merely a tax.

-- based on what he has to report to

you.

14

MS. O'CONNOR:

15

QUESTION:

Right.

You haven't assessed anything yet.

16

How can he possibly take advantage of the provision that

17

allows him to make a correction, to pay in accordance with

18

that correction, and to avoid any interest that he would

19

otherwise be liable for?

20

MS. O'CONNOR:

How can he take advantage of it?
Well, let me point out a couple

21

of things from your question, Justice Souter.

First, let

me direct you to 3121(q).

QUESTION:

Where is 2131(q)?

2

MS. O'CONNOR:

3121(q) is in our joint appendix

3

here -- oh, no, no, it's in the petition.

4

3121(q) is at 58(a).

5

QUESTION:

Thank you.

Thank you very much.
General O'Connor, it might help if

6

you answered specifically whether interest does run on the

7

period between the employer paying what the employee's

8

reports call for and the assessment at a higher amount.

9

MS. O'CONNOR:

Thank you, Justice Ginsburg.

10

there is no interest that runs, and that's why I wanted

11

you to look at 3121(q) in particular.

No,

Then how does this section have an
You say, well, this mitigates it,

MS. O'CONNOR:

QUESTION:

No, I'm sorry --

-- it seems to me that about all the

17

employer can do is pay immediately at the moment of your

18

assessment and therefore no interest will run.

No, I did not mean to suggest

doesn't.

It doesn't need to, because under

It resides in the

It also tells

tells you that the wages are deemed to have been paid when

10

the employee reports them or if the employer -- employee

11

doesn't report them, they are wages deemed to be paid when

12

the IRS issues notice of demand, so until the IRS notifies

13

the restaurant that there is an additional FICA tax due,

14

there is no interest or penalty.

15

QUESTION:

Right, but at that point there is,

16

and if you would come back to Justice O'Connor's question,

17

which was, how could the employer ever know that there was

18

a mistake in the assessment, and you said, well, as soon

19

as he knows it, he can come forward with the additional

20

amount and there won't be any penalty, but how does he

21

know it?

22

That's the problem.
MS. O'CONNOR:

He knows it because the employees

23

are reporting on a monthly basis, and in this case there

24

was clearly -- we have $120,000 of unreported credit card

25

tips in each of the 2 years involved here, $120,000 in

Now, how is the reporter -- how is

MS. O'CONNOR:

The same method that he would use

to make any other determination.

For example, he knows by

10

the basis of the report that all credit card tips are not

11

being reported.

QUESTION:

But the burden is on him.

The burden

is on him to show what the proper amount was.

MS. O'CONNOR:

QUESTION:

That's true, Justice Kennedy.

-- Justice O'Connor's original

3

question was, how is the employer supposed to know, and

4

you say, well, if he doesn't know he can amend later.

5

The whole question is, and the gravamen of the

6

argument put forth by the taxpayer here is that the

7

assessment should be on the person, or on the entity that

8

has the information, and here your information is as good

9

as the employer's, and you have the ability to do what the

10

employer can't, i.e., subpoena the individual records of

the employees.

QUESTION:

Well, as a general proposition I

3

don't think the employer can subpoena the employee.

mean, you have to have a legal proceeding, don't you?

That's what I mean,

If there were some other legal proceeding --

QUESTION:

Well, but I mean, that's not going to

work.

You're suggesting that he ought to fire the

9

employee and then be subjected to a wrongful discharge

10

suit and then subpoena the information so that he can give

11

it to you.

12

Why don't you just ask for it?
MS. O'CONNOR:

Well, actually, there is no

evidence in the record on whether the individual employees

capacity to do it and the employee doesn't.
MS. O'CONNOR:

That's true, Justice Kennedy.

19

The amount of assessment, though, I think it's very

20

important to focus on the fact that in this case, as you

21

can see at page 35 of the joint appendix, the taxpayer

22

here conceded the reasonableness of the assessment,

23

conceded it.

conclusion listening to you is, he can write the check.

Now, I thought her question was,

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to --

there anything else that this restaurant owner has it in

determine the amount of the tip, how many -- what kind of

20

a restaurant you have, how upscale it is, where it's

21

located, the kind of meals you serve -- in fact, the IRS

has a procedure where restaurants can show all that

information, a sample menu to get below the 8 percent.

trying to establish -- in this case, though, let me point

out that at any point during the IRS' examination the

a credit against income tax, dollar for dollar, for the

are paying at least the minimum wage, what gain is there

to the revenue whichever way this comes out?

I have a question that I think Justice Breyer has

that was in the record, because the assessment amount was

2

conceded.

3

only for tips that are not used by the employer to satisfy

4

his minimum wage obligations, yet it's not a complete wash

5

to the Treasury, however, because you still have the FICA

tax being paid in and an income tax credit being given, so

7

it's the trust fund accounting that would have a problem

if you look at it as a complete offset.

1

opportunity to answer that, because I want to hear what

2

the answer is.

3

MS. O'CONNOR:

Congress had the opportunity to

4

say that no, the IRS does not have the authority to do

5

what has been referred to here as aggregate assessment,

6

and I might just point out here that rather than aggregate

7

assessments, which is what the respondent calls what has

8

happened here, respondent would prefer the individual

9

audits and aggregating the estimates, because certainly

10

they would be estimates if they were done on the basis of

11

the individual waiter's reports also.

12

But in 1998, when Congress said that the IRS

13

cannot use a threat of an assessment like this to force

14

restaurants into a TRAC, it clearly had the opportunity to

15

say, and besides, you don't have the authority to do these

16

estimates anyway, these assessments anyway.

17

is very clear, and the only thing that the respondent has

18

ever argued here is that the amount might be wrong, and

19

they can't tell you exactly what it is, but there is no

20

rule that an assessment has to be entirely accurate or

21

precise.

QUESTION:

In United States v.

MS. O'CONNOR:

It is -- United States v. Janis

9

unless it is without any foundation.

Clearly, here, when

10

the assessment is based on the respondent's own report,

11

and more than three-quarters of the assessment is on the

12

amounts that are clearly known to be true, clearly this

13

foundation, this assessment has a foundation.

Oh, I think that would be pushing

12

it a little far, Your Honor, and that's not what United

13

States v. Janis requires.

14

QUESTION:

I would think it would mean that

15

there's some reason to believe the full amount is

accurate, not that three-quarters of it is accurate.

17

MS. O'CONNOR:

That's not what this Court has

held, particularly United States v. Janis, where in fact

the assessment there was based on an estimate of wage-

earning practice.

QUESTION:

By looking at 5 days' worth of wages

Sure, but doesn't the Janis rule

prove the correct figure if the assessment is wrong?

Congress did not require the employer to do what for 30

years it told him it was not required to do. This tax is

said, we're imposing a tax on you, on your neighbor's

25

cows, and they in turn said, yes, well, what we did was,

therefore the average number of cows per acre is Y, and

how many cows my neighbor had.

Number 1, that there is assessed here a tax on the

My reply to that is, we started out

by saying it's wages, including the tips of the employee,

10

and they did not give us a bill for wages which are the

11

tips of the employee.

12

gross tips of all employees collectively, and this Court

MS. POWER:

At the end of the evening the

16

employer would cash out all the employees and would turn

17

over credit card tips to employees who might have received

18

credit card receipts, and those employees would then

19

decide among themselves to whom in what amount they are

20

going to share those tips that they have received, along

21

with any cash tips that they may have --

QUESTION:

But the employer at least has an

aggregate at that point, some that appears from the credit

shared.

QUESTION:

Well, that seems to me all the more

12

reason why the employer should have a strong interest in

13

knowing how the division is being made.

14

MS. POWER:

Well, I think that there are many

15

employees who do not want the employer to have anything to

16

do -- to know -- to do with the tip-sharing arrangements.

17

It is -- tips are the property of the employee.

that, you have --

obligation to pay FICA tax, and has an obligation to pay

it on the total earnings, and it isn't -- your cow analogy

22

didn't just pass me by, because the tax on the employer is

independent of the tax on the employee.

MS. POWER:

QUESTION:

4

That's correct.
So it's the employer's cow.

The FICA

tax belongs to the employer.

5

MS. POWER:

The -- there is no question that the

6

employer owes a FICA tax.

He owes the FICA tax regardless

7

of whether the employee is ever audited.

8

taxes regardless of whether the employee is ever assessed

or the employee ever pays his taxes.

He owes the FICA

It can be assessed

10

against the employer at a completely different time from

11

when it can be assessed against the employee.

12

The employer does not dispute that he owes a FICA

13

tax.

What the employer disputes is, I can't know what I

14

owe that FICA tax on until you make some determination of

15

what the individual earnings are, because until that time,

16

I am denied all defenses employees have that they can

17

raise, and there's a whole list of long --

QUESTION:

But you know what -- in fact, you

stipulated that you don't dispute the facts, the

MS. POWER:

I do not -- we do not dispute the

2

amount of the IRS' aggregate assessments because -- of all

3

employees collectively, because we simply do not have the

4

information to dispute that.

5

from having that information.

information.

7

Congress for 30 years has told us we do not have to

8

concern ourselves with that information, and we do not

9

have the wherewithal to dispute it.

10

Congress has prohibited us
We do not have that

We have never had that information.

So in this case, do I dispute that?

No, because

11

it is not worth disputing that or attempting to even

12

whittle down that assessment in this case.

13

QUESTION:

But your position is, we know that

14

there is a disparity between what is reported and what is

15

actually paid in tips.

16

the employer independently owe a tax on that total amount,

17

and we know about the shortfall, but there is nothing the

That is, let's take a waiter in this
The Government says, you've underreported

MS. POWER:

Isn't that what

No, it's entirely different,

11

because -- and as the McQuatters case that's cited in the

12

briefs by both parties illustrates, in that circumstance,

13

the individual waiter has an opportunity to bring any

14

defenses that he has to the Government's assessment

forward, and we are denied every possible defense by that

scenario.

We had a European clientele, the tips weren't as great as

8

you think.

9

For instance, they say, well, I didn't work as
I don't have the same experience as the other guy
They was stiffing, a tremendous amount of stiffing.

QUESTION:

10

MS. POWER:

11

(Laughter.)

12

MS. POWER:

13

QUESTION:

What is stiffing?
No tip whatsoever.

I'm sorry.
I just don't understand how any of

14

that can get you below the amount that shows up on the

15

credit cards, because for example, say one employee got

16

$2,000 in tips, and he could have a defense that I passed

17

out $600 to the busboys, and maybe his liability is less,

18

but it still seems to me the employer would have to at

19

least pay the aggregate amount on the credit card.

20

MS. POWER:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

No, because -I just don't understand how you get

around that.
MS. POWER:

-- there's a situation where you

24

could have many employees.

There's a very high turnover

25

rate, especially with those who are in the categories that
38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

receive the least amount of tips.

2

and he's a busboy and he's there for the afternoon, and he

3

says, boy, forget this job, I'm leaving, and he takes the

4

tips that he gets that day, and that happens at a much

5

higher percentage --

6

QUESTION:

Somebody who comes in,

Well, that would explain why

7

assessments might be wrong as to individual employees, but

8

it still doesn't reduce the gross amount in the tip column

9

on the credit card.

10

MS. POWER:

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. POWER:

It does reduce the gross amounts -How?
-- that the employer would have to

13

owe, because if any of that credit card tips that you're

14

assuming isn't in fact a tip was received by somebody who

15

made less than $20 a month, the employer doesn't owe any

16

tax on that.

17

QUESTION:

Okay.

That's a possibility, but

18

wouldn't it suffice on any rule of probability if the

19

Government did just what Justice Stevens described?

20

quite true, yes, there might have been an extraordinary

21

turnover, if there is, the employer can come in and say

22

so.

23

what the credit card reports showed, wouldn't the

Government have made an assessment which enjoyed at least

25

a probability of accuracy?

It's

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. POWER:

No, because you go back to 3111 and

2

Congress did not impose a tax on the aggregate earnings of

3

all employees collectively.

4

QUESTION:

So your argument there is that even

5

if you had the perfect evidence, even if there was a memo

6

beyond dispute, written by the accountant and signed by

7

all the employers that said, after the most thorough

8

investigation of this restaurant I'm telling you

9

privately, and you agree, that the total tips earned that

10

are eligible for social security are $350,000, so it's

11

signed by 15 bishops, you know, absolute, dead right,

12

we're saying that even if that's so, he still doesn't owe

13

it because in the memo it doesn't say which employees.

14

MS. POWER:

I think that it needs to say which

15

employees learned which amount, and that's what the tax

16

was imposed upon, and if on the other hand you had all of

17

the employees say yes, I earned this, yes, I earned this,

18

yes, I earned this, then you would have that individual

19

determination.

20

QUESTION:

But there's never been anything held,

21

is there, that where an employer clearly owes a tax to the

22

Government, based because of the earnings of the employee,

23

and there can be different contexts where that comes up,

24

the evidence that he owes that has to name or pick out

25

which employee?

I assume if there were a case that ever
40

Alderson Reporting Company

is.

that's my problem.

Do you think Congress was assuming

there were assessments going on of employers for this

MS. POWER:

And long after the IRS had announced

that they were not doing aggregate assessments.
QUESTION:

The gravamen of your brief is that as

13

a principle an assessment shouldn't be imposed on the

taxpayer unless the taxpayer has the information to

contradict the assessment, which certainly makes a lot of

common sense.

46

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

of congressional history that clearly shows that Congress

2

does not intend for the employer to be put in this

3

position, that Congress did not intend for the employer to

4

be required to police and monitor the reporting of

5

employees, and ostensibly that's what the IRS'

6

interpretation does.

7

QUESTION:

But you have no specific authority or

8

precedent for the proposition that an assessment should

9

not be imposed on a taxpayer unless the taxpayer is in a

10

good or perhaps best position to contradict the

11

assessment?

12

MS. POWER:

I think that we have plenty of

13

authority for the proposition that the assessment in this

14

case is unauthorized because it's on the collective wage-

15

earning on 31 --

me that's the principle argument in your brief.

23

a lot of sense, but I want to know if I'm -- if the

The best I can tell you -Other than the fact that this is

something everybody should know, but that doesn't usually

work.

5

(Laughter.)

6

MS. POWER:

I think that the burden of

7

presumption and the burden of proof that they have put

8

forth is premised upon the understanding that the person

9

with that burden has the records and is in the best

10

position to respond, and that does not characterize this

situation, so those policy considerations behind that are

12

not existing here.

Are there other situations in the tax

17

waiter and the waitress can say, you know, all kinds of

18

things in response, that no, I didn't earn that, here are

my records, here are my individual records of exactly what

20

I earned.

The IRS sends them a bill based on the same

types of estimates, takes it one step further and says,

23

okay, well, you worked X number of hours out of the total

24

number of hours in this restaurant, so of this total share

25

we think your share is this amount.

The waiter or

1

waitress can come in and say no, here's my individual

2

record, and this is exactly what I earned, or no, you're

3

wrong in assuming this, or you're wrong in assuming that,

4

and then a determination can be made of what that

5

individual waiter or waitress made, and then turn around

6

and give it to us.

7

That's exactly what one of the documents in our

8

joint appendix on page 92, that's exactly what the IRS did

9

do before they came up with this aggregate assessment

10

method, because that is precisely what Congress envisioned

11

that the IRS would be doing with the 8027 Form data, is

12

taking that information, using that information to make

13

examinations of individual employees, and then turning

14

around --

15

QUESTION:

Now, practically can the IRS -- are

16

you suggesting that they go after the employees, and then

17

when they know the amount based on the extra tax the

18

employee will have to pay, then say, okay, employer, you

19

pay the same amount, but practically can the IRS -- does

20

it have the facilities to go audit every waiter and busboy

21

and --

22

MS. POWER:

There's no requirement that they

23

audit every waiter or busboy.

In the first place, that

24

letter that I just pointed out didn't require any audit at

25

all, and not only that, in the context of what's happening

they've got this huge, astronomical problem, and we can't

do anything about it.

They're leaving three -- 75 cents on

They come in here and they say that

QUESTION:

Well, the reason is, maybe it isn't

cost-effective to go after the individual employees.

They've only

MS. POWER:

Well, I don't think it's very cost-

effective to do this one, when the employer is --

11

QUESTION:

The employer tax is owed

12

independently, which is what I started to ask you about

13

when you gave your cow example.

14

that's a discrete tax.

There's a tax on the employee.

15

That's a discrete tax.

Why, because the Government is

16

going to have a hard time collecting the tax on the

17

employee, is it disabled from collecting the tax on the

18

employer?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EILEEN J. O'CONNOR

25

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
51
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Ms. O'Connor, at the very outset you

2

said that 311 imposed a tax on wages paid or deemed to

3

have been paid.

4
5

Is the word deemed in the statute?

MS. O'CONNOR:
statute?

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. O'CONNOR:

8

Is the word deemed in the

Yes.
I believe so.

I believe it's in

3121(q), Your Honor, which I keep losing.

9

QUESTION:

10

Well, I'll find it.

MS. O'CONNOR:

Yes, it's on page 58a, is where

11

3121(q) appears, and remember that is a section that

12

provides definitions.

13

tips which are paid or deemed to have been paid, and

14

3121(q) also tells you the time.

15

3121 tells you that wages include

As we have said, this is a tax on an aggregate

16

amount.

17

employer reports the tax, and shows that it is a tax on

18

the wages paid.

19

Form 941 in your joint appendix show how the

QUESTION:

Well, except I think the deeming

20

refers to the time of payment, not to the fact of payment,

21

but I'll look at that.

22

MS. O'CONNOR:

I think you're right about that,

23

Your Honor.

Nonetheless, they are deemed to be paid at

24

the time, right.

25

included, and then the deemed part is -- the tips are

3121(q) tells you that tips are

52
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

wages, and the deemed part is when they are deemed to have

2

been paid.

3

employer, and then it goes on and tells you when.

4

say tips are deemed to have been paid by the employer.

5

That's the very first sentence.

6
7

QUESTION:

It does

It's at page 85a.

How long has IRS been making these

assessments, please, Ms. O'Connor?

8
9

They're deemed to have been paid by the

MS. O'CONNOR:

I believe, Justice O'Connor, that

it did start around 1992 and 1993, and the information

10

that the IRS is gathering on the forms 8027 demonstrated

11

the extent of the problem that Congress suspected did

12

exist about substantial underreporting of tip income.

13

QUESTION:

In view of all the questions about

14

the proper computation, why has the Government resisted

15

notice and comment rulemaking to come up with a fair

16

formula, because the contention is that the Government's

17

formula exaggerates the income, exaggerates the tip

18

income.

19

MS. O'CONNOR:

That is certainly the contention,

20

and there have been, however, no facts to show whether

21

that's true or not, because in each of the cases, not only

22

the Ninth Circuit below, but in each of the three cases

23

that we cite in our briefs decided by the Seventh,

24

Eleventh, and the Federal Circuits, no evidence was ever

25

submitted to show that the tips were overstated in any

way.
QUESTION:

But why not -- why not employ that

3

fair procedure of going through the notice and comment,

4

and then -- I think that's what Judge Kozinski said to do.

5

MS. O'CONNOR:

opinion entirely excludes section --

Yes, he did.
