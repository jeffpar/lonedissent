ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ENGLERT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
25 years ago in United Air Lines v. Evans, this

11
12

Court observed that an employer was entitled to treat a

13

past act as lawful after respondent failed to file a

14

timely charge of discrimination.

15

and I quote -- a discriminatory act, which has not made

16

the basis for a timely charge, is the legal equivalent of

17

a discriminatory act which occurred before the statute was

18

passed.

19

discriminatory act outside the limitations period as

20

merely an unfortunate event in history which has no

21

present legal consequences.

22

In the Court's words --

The Court further referred to the alleged

In the present case, Abner Morgan challenges as

23

discriminatory various acts that he did not make the basis

24

for an EEOC charge within 300 days.

25

that Amtrak was entitled to treat those past acts as

Our contention is

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

lawful after the passage of 300 days.

2

merely unfortunate events in history with no present legal

3

consequences.

4

Those acts are

The Ninth Circuit saw things quite differently.

5

According to the Ninth Circuit, all plaintiffs, completely

6

without regard to their own diligence, may base suit on

7

events they didn't make the basis of a timely charge, as

8

long as those events are sufficiently related to later

9

events that can also be characterized as discrimination.

10

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Englert, there are, I

11

assume even in your view, a few exceptions to this rule.

12

When is it that you would look back?

13

MR. ENGLERT:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. ENGLERT:

For certain diligent plaintiffs --

Yes.
-- who bring suit within 300 days

16

after their cause of action first accrues, we would look

17

back.

18

That obviously isn't this case.
QUESTION:

And there's no other circumstance,

19

you think, where you would end up looking back beyond --

20

where the -- the full thrust of -- of what was going on

21

didn't become evident until the statute had passed as some

22

early -- on some earlier events?

23

MR. ENGLERT:

We would allow plaintiffs, in

24

exactly the situation you described, Justice O'Connor, to

25

look back, the situation in which it was not fully evident

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

until within the 300-day period what was going on.

2

is the exception we're willing to concede.

3

QUESTION:

That

I don't understand how's that's an

4

exception.

I thought we were talking about the period

5

before the 300 days.

6

would allow a person to get recovery for something that

7

happened to him prior to 300 days before he filed?

Is there any instance in which you

8

MR. ENGLERT:

9

QUESTION:

10

Yes, Justice Breyer.

If the --

What is that?

MR. ENGLERT:

-- if the events outside the 300-

11

day window were not sufficiently severe or pervasive to

12

rise to the level of being actionable, then we would

13

concede that the cause of action doesn't accrue until

14

they've become sufficiently severe or pervasive.
QUESTION:

15

What about the circumstance where

16

they're very much related to what did occur within the 300

17

days, but the person isn't certain?

18

judge says, yes, it was independently actionable, but I

19

could understand how a person at the time might think it

20

wasn't.

What about that one?

21

MR. ENGLERT:

22

Justice Breyer, and --

23

I mean, later on the

QUESTION:

Well, there may be close cases,

No, no.

But I want to know.

This --

24

that is the case.

A judge would say a reasonable person

25

would not have realized, though he would have been wrong,

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that those outside-the-period events rose to the level of

2

giving him a cause of action.

3

case?

4
5

MR. ENGLERT:

We -- we would give away that

case.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. ENGLERT:

8

How would you decide that

Okay.
If a reasonable person would not

have known --

9

QUESTION:

Fine.

10

QUESTION:

Would not have known his injury.

So

11

-- so you're saying the test under the act is not injury,

12

but knowledge of injury.

13
14
15

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, Justice Scalia, that gets

into the debate, of course, this Court has had -QUESTION:

I know it does.

16

giving it away.

17

knowledge of injury is --

18

You're -- you're

You're saying that under the act,

MR. ENGLERT:

No.

I -- I'm not trying to give

19

that away.

20

understood Justice Breyer's question to pertain to the

21

situation in which the judge says a reasonable person

22

would not have known, not this particular plaintiff

23

wouldn't have known, but a reasonable person would not

24

have known.

25

I'm trying not to take a position on that.

QUESTION:

Oh, in practice, that's always an

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

I

1

exception to the knowledge of injury rule.

2

diligence, he didn't know.

3

you're willing to accept that.

4
5

MR. ENGLERT:

With due

I mean, but -- but that --

That's why I'm not trying to give

away anything on injury versus injury discovery.

6

QUESTION:

With due diligence -- with due

7

diligence -- the person had due diligence but didn't know.

8

So, it's a -- it's a knowledge -- it's a knowledge of

9

injury test.

10

QUESTION:

Not a subjective knowledge of injury

11

but knowledge of injury that -- that would have occurred

12

to a reasonable person.

13

MR. ENGLERT:

14

QUESTION:

Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice, and --

All right.

If you're willing to give

15

that one away, what about a person who, though he might

16

have understood -- a reasonable person might have

17

understood that this would have been actionable, he's in

18

the middle of negotiations with his company there --

19

there, and it would have been foolish to go to the EEOC.

20

MR. ENGLERT:

21

QUESTION:

22

25

I mean, because after all, we're

trying to settle this thing right within the company.
MR. ENGLERT:

23
24

That plaintiff loses.

Breyer.

That plaintiff loses, Justice

That's quite clear.
QUESTION:

He loses.

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

MR. ENGLERT:
like Robinson Meyers.

3

QUESTION:

And -- and why should he lose where

4

the other one doesn't?

5

MR. ENGLERT:

6

Because this Court has said so.

Cases like Robinson Meyers and Johnson v. --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. ENGLERT:

9

That's quite clear under cases

Are you talking about EEOC cases?
Those -- those are title VII cases

in which -- Robinson Meyers was a case in which the

10

plaintiff exhausted union grievances and then filed the

11

EEOC charge, and the Court said, no, you should have filed

12

your EEOC charge within the statutory period.
QUESTION:

13

Mr. Englert, I'm not aware that there

14

is a case -- perhaps I'm wrong about this -- quite like

15

this where there are a succession of similar acts, a

16

number of disciplines, a number of refusal to give

17

training opportunities, and the employee goes to the EEO

18

-- the in-house person, tries to settle it, tries not to

19

make a Federal case out of it.

20

you would have us adopt would say if you're in doubt, sue

21

instead of saying, if you're in doubt -- each one of these

22

discrete instances that he was trying to work out, we

23

would have to have -- your rule would mean that this

24

person has to file 10 charges with the EEOC instead of

25

one.

And -- but the rule that

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, it's not when in doubt, sue,

2

Justice Ginsburg.

3

and it's an important distinction because the purpose of

4

filing with the EEOC is to start a conciliatory process.

5

QUESTION:

It is when in doubt, go to the EEOC,

But he's always -- he also has the

6

in-house.

He's got a conciliatory process going without

7

involving the Federal Government.

8

his employer.

9

did.

He's just dealing with

His employer has an EEO counselor.

He didn't come to a Federal agency.

That he

So, let's take

10

it that we're talking about the EEOC and not suing in

11

court.
The EEOC -- one of its objections is you would

12
13

be breeding tremendous fragmentation here because on every

14

incident in a pattern, he'd have to file another EEOC

15

charge.

That much you are saying.
MR. ENGLERT:

16

That much I am saying, and that is

17

very consistent with the purposes of the title VII charge-

18

filing requirement, which is to cause plaintiffs to go

19

promptly to the EEOC, as this Court itself has said in a

20

number of its cases, and to get that process started

21

quickly.

22

Now, there -- there could be rare cases, Justice

23

Ginsburg, in which equitable tolling would apply on the

24

facts that you've suggested.

25

I don't think there are many such cases.

This isn't one of them, and
But if one is in

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the middle of some kind of negotiation and is being misled

2

into thinking that it's all going to work out and

3

therefore don't got to the EEOC, that person might have an

4

equitable tolling argument, although as this Court has

5

said, the virtue of equitable tolling is that it is so

6

rarely invoked --

7

QUESTION:

Well, I guess any statute of

8

limitations of any sort means you -- you have to sue 10

9

times instead of one time, doesn't it?

10

MR. ENGLERT:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

I mean, it's the nature of a statute

12

of limitations that when you're hurt, you have to sue.

13

You can't wait till you're hurt the 10th time and then

14

say, well, you know, let's put it in one big package.

15

I'll wait 10 years until I'm hurt -- hurt more often.

16

MR. ENGLERT:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Scalia, and --

Mr. Englert, I don't think that this

18

is in any case.

19

so-called hostile atmosphere case, the first epithet, even

20

the second, it's -- it's uncertain when how much is enough

21

and when it's insufficient.

22

that at least in that category of case, there would have

23

to be a succession of similar incidents.

24
25

I think you have recognized that in the

MR. ENGLERT:

Yes.

So, I think you recognize

That's part of the

definition of the very violation of title VII in hostile

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

environment cases.

2

QUESTION:

In other words, you're -- you're

3

saying that there is no pervasive hostility, no pervasive

4

hostile environment until the acts are repeated, or is it

5

there is a pervasive hostile environment, but it's just

6

not discovered until the acts are repeated?

7

which of the two is it?

8
9

MR. ENGLERT:

Which --

The case I'm willing to concede,

looking back beyond 300 days, is the case in which there

10

is no hostile environment until within the 300-day period.

11

The fact that the hostile environment isn't discovered I

12

have not conceded.
QUESTION:

13

That -- that case I have not conceded.
Wait.

Now, you say there is no

14

hostile -- what are you conceding?

15

evidence can be brought in, or that you can get damages

16

for those events?
MR. ENGLERT:

17

That that -- that that

I'm conceding that you can get

18

back pay or damages for those events as the Seventh

19

Circuit said in Galloway and as the First Circuit said in

20

Sabree.

21

QUESTION:

Well, why if -- if you assert that

22

there hasn't been any offense when those events occurred?

23

You say there's not yet a hostile environment.

24

you be able to get any damages for a period during which

25

there as not a hostile environment?

Why should

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, the hypothetical example,

2

Justice Scalia, that I think makes the point is suppose

3

there is an epithet at the office Christmas party one

4

year.

5

party the next year.

6

office Christmas party the third year, and the person has

7

to seek psychological counseling after each of those.

8

It's not going to rise to the level, in all likelihood, of

9

a hostile environment after one epithet, but with

10

repetition, it can rise to the level of a hostile

11

environment.

12

Then there's an epithet at the office Christmas

QUESTION:

Then there's an epithet at the

Well, sure, but it doesn't make the

13

first one a hostile environment.

14

MR. ENGLERT:

No, but the statute of

15

limitations, under standard accrual principles, didn't

16

begin to run until it became a hostile environment, and

17

we're suggesting --

18

QUESTION:

But if that's the case, you don't

19

have to concede anything because the hostile environment

20

doesn't occur, as you're analyzing it, until -- within the

21

300-day period.

22

I thought what you meant was that you would

23

concede the -- the case -- you would concede the

24

application of continuing violation when the hostile

25

environment was not apparent enough to bring a lawsuit

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

until you get within the 300-day period -- yes, the -- the

2

limitation period.

3

MR. ENGLERT:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

Okay.

But you're saying that -- I --

5

I thought, in answer to Justice Scalia, you were saying

6

there is no hostile environment prior to the third

7

incident, which is within the period.

8

MR. ENGLERT:

9

QUESTION:

No, I --

Maybe that isn't what you meant.

10

MR. ENGLERT:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. ENGLERT:

I think --

That's how I understood him.
Justice Souter -- and I don't know

13

that I want to spend much more of my argument on

14

concessions, but --

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. ENGLERT:

-- I think the -- the point is

17

that the entire series of actions that constitute the

18

hostile environment are all part of the hostile

19

environment, but it may not --

20

QUESTION:

Okay.

Then the hostile environment

21

goes back beyond the 300-day period.

You're saying a

22

hostile environment began with the first epithet, but you

23

didn't have a -- a sufficiently obvious indication of it

24

until you got to epithet three.

25

MR. ENGLERT:

In 20/20 hindsight, this is how

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

hostile environment cases work.

2

hostile environment on day 1 may actually become part of a

3

hostile environment on day 300.

4

QUESTION:

Good.

An epithet that was not a

Then change your answer to my

5

earlier question because I asked you whether there was a

6

hostile environment at the first incident -- incident, and

7

you said no, it -- there was not yet until the last

8

incident.

9

where there's been a hostile environment all along, but it

You're talking about a different situation

10

doesn't become apparent until the third incident, but

11

there really was one the first time the epithet was used.

12

That's a different situation, and we got to know which one

13

of the two you -- you want us to allow.
QUESTION:

14

And that was my -- and that was my

15

question.

And I want to know which one you think this

16

case is, and I also want to know can there be both kinds

17

of cases and we have to see which applies -- which

18

description applies in each instance.
MR. ENGLERT:

19

Okay.

In -- in this case, Mr.

20

Morgan was complaining to members of Congress starting in

21

1991.

22

he was being discriminated against from long before the

23

statute of limitations ran.

24
25

There is absolutely no doubt that he thought that

QUESTION:

Is this a hostile environment claim,

do you think?

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ENGLERT:

Not primarily, but there is a

2

hostile environment claim in this case as the Ninth

3

Circuit saw it.

4
5

QUESTION:

It is in the case.

Is it a pattern

and practice case?

6

MR. ENGLERT:

No, Your Honor.

Pattern or

7

practice is a term in section 707 of the act, which

8

applies exclusively to governmental actions, and the Court

9

has used that phrase in certain class actions as well --

10

in private class actions, but this is not a class action

11

either.
QUESTION:

12
13

claim included here.
MR. ENGLERT:

14
15
16

But it could be a hostile environment

The Ninth Circuit believed there

was, yes.
But in any event, Mr. Morgan was -- was well

17

aware long before he filed his EEOC charge that he had a

18

-- a claim of discrimination.

19

QUESTION:

I --

May I ask you about a hypothetical

20

that's perhaps a little simpler to discuss?

Supposing the

21

company had a policy that was unwritten or secret or

22

something like that, we will not allow any woman into a

23

certain job category, no woman, no black into a certain

24

job category.

25

policy was formally described and so forth.

It's -- it's found out 3 years after the
And then a

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

person who repeatedly tried to get into that job category

2

over the entire 3-year period but was refused each time

3

because of the existence of a continuing policy, does that

4

person have any right to recover for anything happening

5

prior to the 300 days?

6

MR. ENGLERT:

I think not, Justice Stevens, but

7

that raises two issues that are not in this case.

8

fraudulent concealment, and the second is the issue of

9

injury versus injury discovery for statutes of

10

One is

limitation --

11

QUESTION:

12

but I'm assuming --

I'm assuming there's no discovery,

13

MR. ENGLERT:

14

QUESTION:

No.

-- if you can ever describe anything

15

as a continuing violation, I have described a continuing

16

discriminatory policy.

17

it's all one policy and it had a several -- manifested

18

itself in several different incidents, is it -- may a

19

plaintiff recover for something that happened prior to the

20

300-day filing?

21

in this case it seems to me.

That's my -- sort of the basic question

22

MR. ENGLERT:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. ENGLERT:

25

And if it's clear as a bell that

My short answer is no.

Okay.
My longer answer is no unless this

Court resolves an issue that is not presented by this case

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

which is injury versus injury discovery in favor of an

2

injury discovery rule.

3
4

QUESTION:
enough.

5
6

You're saying injury would not be

MR. ENGLERT:

That issue is not in this case,

but that is my -- I'm saying injury would be enough.

7

QUESTION:

Well, arguably it would be in this

8

case to the extent the hostile environment claim is a

9

continuing violation.

I don't know whether it is, but

10

arguably that's -- the hostile environment claim

11

conceivably could be a continuing policy also.
MR. ENGLERT:

12

It could be, but the reason I'm

13

making a concession with regard to hostile environment

14

claims is not injury versus injury discovery.

15

I'm making a concession is because under standard

16

principles of accrual, the plaintiff may not sue until he

17

or she actually has a cause of action.

18

hostile environment claim can only develop over time, it

19

may be that not until the third, fourth, fifth epithet,

20

incident is -- is there anything for the plaintiff to sue

21

on.

22

QUESTION:

The reason

And because a

Well, my assumption is a case --

23

there was a violation all along, but the -- the charge was

24

not filed within 300 days of the commencement of a

25

continuing violation.

The question I have in the back of

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

my mind is, could there be recovery for the portion of the

2

continuing violation that was more than 300 days old?

3

MR. ENGLERT:

There -- no.

There can always be

4

recovery for the portion of the continuing violation

5

within the 300 days.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Englert, you have been deflected

7

from what I think is the strongest point on the other side

8

that said, that's all well and good, but Congress

9

understood you could go back way beyond the 300 days

10

because they put a 2-year cap on back pay.

11

MR. ENGLERT:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

So, that shows how, whatever you

13

might say, just looking at the words of the statute,

14

Congress understood that you have to shorten the period

15

and the period they picked was 2 years, much longer than

16

180 days or 300.

17

MR. ENGLERT:

And let me try very quickly to say

18

why that argument is not a good argument.

Congress did

19

worry that there was no time limit on title VII actions

20

and it put the 2 years in there.

21

the continuing effects doctrine, which this Court

22

repudiated in 1977, and that's because this Court hadn't

23

clearly said the title VII statute of limitations is

24

section 706(e) until 1982 in Zipes.

25

courts were actually borrowing State statutes of

But that's because of

Many of the lower

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

limitations on the theory that title VII had no statute of

2

limitations of its own.

3

Zipes, and now all of the Federal courts of appeals,

4

including the Ninth Circuit, agree that 706(e) is a

5

statute of limitations.

6
7

This Court laid that to rest in

If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my
time.

QUESTION:

Mr. Schlick, we'll hear from you.

Very well, Mr. Englert.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK

11

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

12

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

13
14
15

MR. SCHLICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court's decision in Zipes established and

16

the Court reaffirmed in Lorance that section 706(e)

17

operates as a statute of limitations.

18

period begins to run with the occurrence of the alleged

19

unlawful employment practice.

20

The limitations

In this case, respondent could sue on alleged

21

violations that occurred not more than 300 days before he

22

filed his charge with EEOC, but he could not sue on

23

alleged violations that occurred earlier and outside the

24

limitations period.

25

Our construction of section 706(e) gives effect

3

recover for ongoing violations.

4

ensures that employers will not be liable for violations

5

that -- that occurred long ago.

6

QUESTION:

On the one

At the same time, it

When you say ongoing violations and

7

taking my hypothetical, could they recover for damages

8

prior to the 300 days?

9

MR. SCHLICK:

In your hypothetical, Justice

10

Stevens, recovery would only be available if equitable

11

tolling came into play.

12

based on -- based on the conceal -- equitable estoppel

13

based on the concealment that you mentioned in your

14

hypothetical, recovery would be limited to 300 days.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

As -- absent equitable tolling

In my hypothetical it would be

limited to 300 days.
MR. SCHLICK:

Yes, Justice Stevens.

The fact

18

that it was continuing would not -- would not affect the

19

application of a 300-day period.

20

QUESTION:

In a nutshell, where do you think the

21

Ninth Circuit went wrong, which I take it you believe is

22

the case here?

23

MR. SCHLICK:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

There were

24

two categories of claims at issue in this case.

The first

25

is what Ninth Circuit referred to as serial violations,

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that is, independently actionable alleged violations of

2

title VII.

3

Circuit went wrong in holding that violations that

4

occurred -- that accrued more than 300 days before the --

5

the charge was filed were actionable.

6

And as to -- as to those claims, the Ninth

The second claim was a hostile work environment

7

claim.

Now, the allegation of the complaint and the

8

claims at trial were that the hostile work environment

9

became actionable right from the outset of Mr. Morgan's

10

employment with -- with Amtrak.

It was actionable

11

throughout the period.

12

a charge on that -- on that claim until years later.

13

Accordingly, he could only recover for 300 days of the

14

alleged maintenance of the hostile work environment.

Mr. Morgan, however, didn't bring

15

Now, our construction --

16

QUESTION:

On your theory then, the -- the only

17

thing that the continuing violation concept gives, in

18

effect, is a right to use evidence of something that

19

happened prior to the period.

20

give any right to damages for the -- whatever the damage

21

is for the hostility prior to the 300-day period.

22

turned it into an evidentiary rule, it seems to me.

23

MR. SCHLICK:

No.

It does not, in effect,

So, you

Although evidence says that

24

events outside the limitations period are admissible as

25

background evidence, our view of the continuing violation

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

doctrine is that it allows a plaintiff to sue

2

notwithstanding that there may have been notice of -- of

3

similar violations outside the limitations period.

4

that's the application of the continuing violation

5

doctrine --

6

QUESTION:

Oh.

And

So, you're saying if there has

7

been no -- let's -- let's assume a case in which there is

8

no independent notice of the hostile environment within

9

the 300-day period.

They would still be able to sue on a

10

continuing violation theory.

11

evidentiary rule, they would not be able to sue within

12

that period.
MR. SCHLICK:

13

Whereas, if it were a purely

Suit -- suit could be brought

14

within 300 days for the entirety provided that it accrued

15

within the 300 days.

16

continuing violation rule is that notice outside the

17

limitations period -- in this case going back to the

18

serial claims, in this case notice of related violations

19

outside the limitations period do not prevent Mr. Morgan

20

for suing on violations that occurred within the

21

limitations period.

22

QUESTION:

And the -- the relevance of the

Let's -- let's assume you have a

23

hostile work environment that goes on for 900 days.

He

24

doesn't bring an action until the last 300 days or until

25

day 601.

What -- what you're saying, I believe -- and

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

correct me if I'm wrong -- is that the mere fact that the

2

hostile work environment really commenced 600 days ago

3

does -- or 900 days ago does not bar you from getting

4

damages for the last 300 days.

MR. SCHLICK:

That's correct, Justice Scalia.

17

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

And you also think he can -- don't

19

you think he can get damages for the whole 900 days if a

20

reasonable person wouldn't have realized that those first

21

600 days were actionable?

22

MR. SCHLICK:

That, Justice Breyer, is the

23

question of accrual under Harris.

The -- the standard for

24

the claim in that case would be whether the work

25

environment -- the -- was severe and pervasive both

QUESTION:

All right.

Now, if you -- if you --

3

what about just modifying it a little to try to give

4

meaning to the 2 years of back pay that you could get and

5

all the other things and realities of the work place, and

6

say, as long as it was reasonable for him not to go to the

7

EEOC, he can recover for the whole 900 days?

8
9

And there are a lot of reasons it's reasonable
not to go to the EEOC.

Maybe because you didn't quite

understand what was going on.

that some guy made.

13

you thought the employer will work it out.

14

thought your supervisor wasn't the rat he turned out to

be.

long as a judge would say it was reasonable, what about

that?

Maybe you thought those were just comments
He should be better educated.

All right, or whatever.

would allow -- that would extend the limitations period is

MR. SCHLICK:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA Y. PRICE

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16
17
18

MS. PRICE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Ongoing violations of the law must be treated

19

differently from discrete acts.

A continuing unlawful

20

practice which involves a present violation of the act

21

means that the claim is not stale.

22

180 days solely would essentially nullify section 706(g).

23

It would allow the defendant in this case Amtrak -- would

24

essentially negate the language of title VII which speaks

25

in terms of practices.

Limiting liability to

QUESTION:

Well, I mean, the claim is not stale,

3

of course, as to the continuing acts.

4

you go back for the acts as -- as to which the statute

5

arguably has run.

6

MS. PRICE:

7

QUESTION:

The question is can

This is true.
And -- and so the -- the question is

8

not whether or not you can sue continuing acts.

9

indeed a continuing act, you can sue for the acts that are

10

within the -- the period.

11

back.
MS. PRICE:

12

If it's

The question is can you go

Yes, Your Honor.

And it is true

13

that we believe that you can go back.

With respect to

14

back pay, Congress has specifically provided under 706(g)

15

that you can go back 2 years for back pay liability.
With -- and there is a difference between a

16
17

liability for damages and liability for essentially

18

liability's sake.

19

Congress did not put a limit in as to how far you could go

20

back.

21

for purposes of initiating the conciliatory involvement of

22

the EEOC.

23

it's like a statute of limitations, it does not dictate

24

how far you go back in terms of establishing the

25

employer's liability.

Under the statute, under title VII,

It said you must file the charge within 300 days

But filing the charge while, you said in Zipes,

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

You said in Havens that where you have a

2

continuing practice of discrimination, that it is

3

appropriate to allow the plaintiff to recover for the

4

entire practice and --

5
6
7

QUESTION:

But Havens was a different statute,

was it not?
MS. PRICE:

It is a -- it is -- yes, sir.

It

8

was a different statute but it has the same language and

9

it has the same purpose.

It was a statute intended to

10

outlaw discrimination, and it is supposed to be

11

interpreted with the same understanding, one, that it's a

12

statute that's going to be utilized by lay persons, and

13

two, that it has a broad remedial intent.

14

QUESTION:

Well, have we ever set aside this

15

type of statute and said we give all possible breaks to

16

plaintiffs on it?

17

I don't believe we have.

MS. PRICE:

No.

I don't believe you have.

And

18

I think what you said in Zipes, Mr. Chief Justice, was

19

that it was necessary to strike a balance to allow for the

20

prompt filing for -- to give notice to allow the EEOC to

21

give notice to the employer and to be sure to effectuate

22

the remedial intent of the statute.

23

balance struck.

So, there was a

24

If you date the trigger period for the statute

25

of limitations from the date that the person either knew

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

or reasonably should have known, you disrupt that balance

2

because then you're moving the trigger from the last

3

occurrence of the practice to an uncertain time when the

4

plaintiff either reasonably should have known or

5

unreasonably should have known.

6

QUESTION:

Ms. Price, the Ninth Circuit, whose

7

judgment we're reviewing here, as nearly as I can tell

8

seems to take a different view of what can be included for

9

damages as actionable than that taken by other circuits

10

that have looked at the same statute and the same problem.

11

MS. PRICE:

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. PRICE:

It is -- yes, ma'am.
Would you agree with that?
Yes, ma'am.

I would agree that it

has taken a -- that there is a split in the circuits.

15

believe --

QUESTION:

17

MS. PRICE:

Yes, a very lopsided split really.
Well, I think the Ninth Circuit's

position is actually in the majority view.

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. PRICE:

21

(Laughter.)

22

MS. PRICE:

It's a big circuit.

Right?

Yes.

Yes, but none of the circuits

23

disagree about what constitutes a continuing violation.

24

Where the disagreement is is in -- similar in this case.

25

There's a disagreement between us and Amtrak as to when

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the trigger for the practice -- for the charge-filing

2

requirement occurs.

3

between us and the Government as to what is covered in

4

that 300-day period.

5

QUESTION:

There's a disagreement as -- with --

Well, if there are separate events

6

that have occurred and if each one standing alone would be

7

actionable and if no charge is filed or suit brought until

8

after the time limit established for some of the

9

violations, what do we do?

10

MS. PRICE:

Well, you look, as the circuits have

11

uniformly looked, as to whether or not it is a practice or

12

a continuing violation.

13

at the case as a series of discrete acts, then yes, we

14

lose.

15

discrete acts, and in fact, the majority of the issues

16

that Mr. Morgan was addressing were not actionable in and

17

of themselves.

before the applicable statutory period had expired were

MS. PRICE:

I -- no, I don't.

I think that

22

there were some that, if they had occurred in isolation,

23

could have been actionable.

we did not pursue this case as one for a violation, for

event, if it occurred in isolation, would be actionable,

you are saying then that it was actionable by itself

without combining it with anything else.

6

MS. PRICE:

Yes, sir, I am saying that.

It is

7

true that if that is -- the difference between a discrete

8

act and a continuing practice of discrimination.

QUESTION:

Well, what do you mean by a

or whatever.

And is it your position that -- that when it is finally

filed 2 years later, you can get back pay or damages for

the whole 2 years, even though, you know, you had the

18

claim 2 years ago.

Let's assume that that occurs and then --

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I don't -- I'm not sure

14

what your answer is to my hypothetical, and -- and I asked

15

the hypothetical because frankly I don't see how a hostile

16

environment claim is any different from a failure to

17

promote claim.

18

the loss of salary continues right over the 2 years, just

19

as a hostile environment claim continues over 2 years.

20

That failure to promote continues.

MS. PRICE:

The --

This Court has defined a hostile

21

environment as the -- the actionable part of it is the

22

environment itself.

23

Justice's hypothetical, I believe that you're focusing on

24

the discrete act of a failure to promote that individual,

25

which is -- has a definite beginning, end.

It's not the discrete acts.

In the

It's right

there.

2

It happens.
In a hostile environment, it's not so simple.

3

Hostile environment -- you can have an act that might not

4

be actionable, but when you -- when you look at it over a

5

period of time, a series of acts, that it's cumulative and

6

the harm is indivisible.

7

related solely to the failure to promote.

8

environment case, you can't separate the harm that's

9

caused on day 899 from the harm that's caused on day 200.

10

QUESTION:

In a promotion case, the harm is
In a hostile

What you're saying, if I understand

11

it correct, is the promotion is a discrete violation with

12

continuing effects, whereas a hostile environment is a

13

continuing violation.

MS. PRICE:

Yes.

Yes, Justice Stevens.

recover damages then back for the entire 10 years or 15

2

years, or is there some cutoff point behind which you

3

won't get the damages?

4

MS. PRICE:

The ability to recover damages in

5

that circumstances depends on a number of factors.

6

would be the plaintiff's ability to establish that it is

7

in fact a continuing violation that --

8

QUESTION:

9

MS. PRICE:

Well, he does.

First

Let's assume he does.

Then his ability would be affected

10

by this Court's decisions in both Faragher and Burlington

11

Industries where this Court said that if there's no

12

tangible employment action and the employer can show that

13

it has taken appropriate steps to prevent or remedy

14

discrimination, and the plaintiff --

QUESTION:

16

MS. PRICE:

17

(Laughter.)

18

MS. PRICE:

No, they didn't.
Okay.

Well, if they can't show that the

19

victim unreasonably failed to take advantage of whatever

20

remedies or opportunities were -- were not available or

21

should have been available, then yes, the plaintiff

22

would --

23

QUESTION:

I just wonder.

You see, if at some

24

point we might say, well, he should have gone to the EEOC.

25

It was unreasonable of him not to.

I wouldn't say he had

36
Alderson Reporting Company

to do it immediately, but after many years?

we want to give him damages all the way back?

3

MS. PRICE:

And -- and do

The damages question again is a

4

separate question from liability.

The damages are going

5

to be limited by 706(g) which provides a 2-year cap on

6

back pay and by the caps that Congress has enacted for

7

compensatory damages.

to get $50,000.

For instance, if -- if his employer

QUESTION:

But would you --

11

QUESTION:

Why is it that if there's a

12

continuing violation, say, for 900 days and you file on

13

the 900th day, that you can go back for the first 600

14

days?

15

Why?
MS. PRICE:

Because the statute must have the

16

ability to reach practices.

17

pattern or practice of retaliation or discrimination, this

18

statute in particular is designed to get at that.

19

QUESTION:

Where you have a longstanding

It does reach it.

The only question

20

is, you know, how many damages you get, whether you -- you

21

have to be prompt and bring your action soon enough to put

22

an end to it.

23

can reach the pattern or practice.

24
25

I mean, it's not a question of whether you

MS. PRICE:

You certainly can.

Well, but if you limit the period

for which you can reach it to only 300 days, you're

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

essentially immunizing the employer who has engaged in a

QUESTION:

No, you're not.

You're -- you're

telling the person who's been harmed, you know, if you're

5

harmed, take action right away --

MS. PRICE:

7

QUESTION:

8

Well --- which is the whole purpose of

statutes of limitations.

9

MS. PRICE:

You're telling the person not simply

10

to take action, Justice Scalia, but to take action that it

11

may in fact result in greater retaliation or a loss of

12

employment.

13

employer --

You're not telling them simply to go to the

QUESTION:

Well, but that's -- but that's always

16

QUESTION:

Retaliation is a separate claim.

17

QUESTION:

I -- I thought your answer might be

14
15

true.

18

that it's difficult to know that there's a pervasive

19

environment until you look at a whole context of acts.

20

I'm not sure that would be a conclusive -- but at least

21

that's a reason.

22

in order to enforce the act, that -- that just begs the

23

question.

But when you say, well, it's necessary

24

MS. PRICE:

Well, I think that there are cases

25

where it's difficult to know.

There are also cases where

1

people --

2

QUESTION:

All right.

That's one reason.

3

Suppose -- suppose that we play with the

4

hypothetical and we establish that it wasn't difficult to

5

know.

6

requiring the courts to go back?

Is there any other reason for allowing us -- for

7

MS. PRICE:

It's not that -- well, it's because

8

it's fundamentally a continuing violation of the statute,

9

and the statute itself allows for you to deal with

10

practices.
Number two, you have the 706(g) statute which

11
12

allows the court to -- or allows a -- entitles a victim of

13

discrimination to recover damages for a 2-year period, for

14

back pay.
QUESTION:

15
16

And you say that for compensatory

damages you rely on the lid in dollar amount.

17

MS. PRICE:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.
For back pay time.

But I take it

19

your argument would be no different if there were no

20

ceiling on the amount you could get for compensatory or

21

punitive damages.
MS. PRICE:

22

That is correct, and the reason why

23

is because Congress looked at this problem.

24

at this problem in 1972.

25

in 1991.

They looked

They looked at the problem again

Congress did not set an anterior limit on

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

liability under title VII, and where Congress has not

2

acted to do that, it is not appropriate for the Court to

3

set that limit.

4

QUESTION:

Ms. Price, I don't understand the

5

rationale for treating continuing violations differently

6

in so far as how far you can go back to get damages.

7

can understand why you should treat them differently for

8

purposes of determining whether you can bring suit at all.

9

That is, if it's a continuing violation, the mere fact

I

10

that you didn't bring suit within 300 days after the

11

violation started doesn't matter.

12

bring suit at any point during the continuing violation.

13

But it's a separate question whether, once you do bring

14

suit, you can get damages all the way back to the

15

beginning of it or rather damages just back 300 days.

16

see no -- no reason conceptually why you should have --

17

you should be able to go all the way back.

18

You can -- you can

Take a failure to promote, which we discussed

19

before, which you say is a one-shot violation, not a

20

continuing violation.

21

MS. PRICE:

22

QUESTION:

23

I

Okay?
Yes, Your Honor.
You -- you can't bring suit for that

if you don't sue within 300 days.

24

Suppose it's not a failure to promote.

It is

25

simply a failure to pay the salary that this person in --

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in the job the person has is entitled to, and that's a

2

continuing violation.

3

MS. PRICE:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.
It continues on and on.

And you're

5

saying that even though that's been continuing on and on

6

for 2 years and the -- the employee doesn't take any

7

action, he can go all the way back for the whole 2 years

8

instead of just back for the last 30 days -- last 300

9

days.

10
11

I -- I don't see conceptually why that ought to be

the case.
MS. PRICE:

706(g) determines how far one can go

12

for back damages.

13

liability, the difference -- conceptually there may not be

14

a difference.

15

Court addressed that particular scenario, and in that

16

particular scenario, the Court said every time the person

17

receives a -- a check that's less, then that constitutes a

18

violation.

19

the Court's hypothetical that the employee could file a

20

charge for each one of those paychecks, and I think that

21

that sort of turns Congress' --

22
23
24
25

If the concern is one with respect to

But in fact in the -- in Bazemore, this

I mean, it's conceivable under your -- under

QUESTION:

You're saying it's not a continuing

violation.
MS. PRICE:

Right.

I mean, and that -- that

upsets I believe what Congress really intended to do.

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

That would essentially eliminate the caps entirely.

2

And we have that potential problem in this case.

3

If you look at this case as a series of discrete acts, you

4

require Mr. Morgan to file a charge every time he's

5

charged with a rule L violation or every time they

6

threaten to charge him or every time they suggest that he

7

shouldn't have been -- that he was 2 minutes late for

8

work.

9

not become the basis for title VII charges.

10

Those kinds of things in and of themselves should

You have to allow for the circumstance where the

11

employee is in fact being subjected to a -- a persistent

12

and a continuing pattern of discrimination that becomes

13

actionable within the 300-day or the 180-day charge-filing

14

period.

15

QUESTION:

Well, should we look to what a

16

reasonable person should be expected to recognize as a

17

cause of action?

18

MS. PRICE:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

No.

I think no, Justice O'Connor.

There shouldn't be any objective test

element in it?
MS. PRICE:

I think that it's appropriate to

22

look at this continuing violation circumstance in the same

23

way in which the Court has looked at the hostile

24

environment claim.

25

the Court has imposed both an objective test and a

And in the hostile environment claim,

cause of action.

4

That's in the definition of the

In this case, the definition of the cause of

5

action is already found within title VII.

6

defines what practices violate the act.

7

Title VII

With respect to the timing, title VII doesn't

say -- there's nowhere in title VII where it says that you

13

unlawful practice.

14

think that's what the Court has to impose on employers.

15

That is the certainty that employers are entitled to.

16

It's in the language.

Title VII ties the requirement that you file a

17

There is no notice requirement in

So, the last act is just the last act that

happens before the employee decided to bring the suit.

on.

25

-- the last act is the one that the complainant would

pick.

Right?

2

MS. PRICE:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
I think your basic position is these

4

filing periods are like a statute of limitations in some

5

respects but not in other respects.

6

MS. PRICE:

This is true, and I believe that's

7

why there is that language in Zipes.

It is true that

8

there have been times when it's been referred to as -- as

9

a statute of limitations, but in Zipes where the Court

10

looked at it and when you look at the actual purpose of it

11

in Occidental Life Insurance Company v. EEOC, again the

12

Court looked at the purpose of the charge-filing

That's really all it does.

There's other statutes of limitations or things

Or the 45 days that you have if

21

you're a Government employee to start consulting in your

23

MS. PRICE:

Exactly.

This is not your

traditional statute of limitations that defines the period

25

of time for which liability may be imposed.

1

QUESTION:

One of -- one of the peculiarities is

2

the difference between 180-day and 300 which makes very

3

good sense as far as administrative exhaustion is

4

concerned.

5

MS. PRICE:

6

QUESTION:

Yes.
But as -- why should the person who's

7

in a deferral state get 300 days while the person who's

8

not get only 180 days if we're talking about a statute of

9

limitations as measuring the ripeness or staleness of a

10

claim?
MS. PRICE:

11

Yes, that is true.

Congress

12

understood that this statute could be utilized with change

13

depending on where one lived, depending on what sector of

14

the employment arena one is found in.

15

appropriate to rely upon this particular statute as

16

determining the period of liability.

17

18

specifically tried to address the concerns of employers.

So, it's not

You must look to

Viewing this case solely as a -- as a series of

discrete acts ignores the fundamental problem that Mr.

In this case, Mr. -- Justice Scalia,

8

the -- as I pointed out, the -- the statute of limitations

9

operates somewhat differently.

10

It's like a statute of

limitations.

11

More to the point, however, in this case, as in

12

the cases that are addressed by title VII, you're talking

13

about an employment relationship, an ongoing relationship

14

where the evidence that is -- we've presented in our

15

amicus briefs is that the person wants to maintain their

16

employment, and there is a very real fear that if you go

17

outside the scope of your employment to an outside agency,

18

that's going to tear apart the employment relationship.

19

That -- that is essentially crossing the river, and you

20

can't go back from that.

21

allow people an opportunity, and that's the -- the focus

22

of the statute was to allow the EEOC not to come in and

resolve the problem without the necessity of a lawsuit.

This is true.

And again, it's

interpreted.

in other areas of the law, and it does define -- it really

MS. PRICE:

So, they set 2 years.

The

problem with Mr. Englert's view of it is that Congress had

10

another opportunity after this Court's decision in Zipes

11

in 1991, and Congress did not change either 706(g) and it

12

didn't change 706(e).
It did address the very concern that employers

13
14

were raising, that we're going to be subjected to

15

unlimited damages where you -- if you allow compensatory

16

damages, and Congress put in the caps.

excuse me -- nontemporal limits, by putting in a monetary

limit.

it did not.

Congress could have put in a temporal limit, and

It could have taken out 706(g), and it did not.

So, to suggest that that section is -- is a superfluous

section that only addresses some long past effect of title

24

VII or a doctrine that is no longer a part of title VII is

25

inaccurate.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. ENGLERT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

16

Justice O'Connor, in one of her questions for

17

Ms. Price, referred to the very lopsided split in the

18

circuits, and I agree that there's a very lopsided split

19

contrary to the Ninth Circuit's view.

20

many circuit cases that I'm aware of -- at least the

21

recent circuit cases -- actually discusses the 706(g)

22

issue that's taken up much of the argument time today, and

23

that is the First Circuit's opinion in Sabree, which

24

actually comes out squarely where we come out in this

25

case, that in general damages are cut off at 300 days.

what the continuing violation doctrine is in all other

QUESTION:

Could you explain the logic in
