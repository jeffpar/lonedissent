ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 00-511

11

MR. BARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

12

I'd like to start with a brief illustration that

13

I think will help crystalize the legal issues, both the

14

so-called forward-looking issues and the historical cost

15

issues.

16

looking perspective.

17

The illustration itself starts with a forward-

Now, any firm that operates and builds a network

18

incurs three costs going forward.

Let's say I, the

19

hypothetical new entrant capable of coming in today and

20

instantaneously deploying the most efficient network

21

possible today, I would have to expend my baseline

22

facility costs.

23

say that costs about $180 billion to reproduce the system

24

today from scratch.

25

that are dictated by the network that I just built.

And let's say the FCC is right.

Let's

Then I would face my operating costs

MR. BARR:

You -- you presented three questions.

Is -- is your illustration and what you're about to

11

I'm

particular?
MR. BARR:

I'm going to show -- it's devoted to

12

all three, and I'm going to show how TELRIC does not,

13

going forward, permit the recovery because it bases

14

compensation, for someone who has already expended money

15

on the network, on the imaginary cost structure of a

16

hypothetical entrant who can be unconstrained and who's

17

capable, at any given time, of instantaneously deploying

18

and ubiquitously deploying a brand new network that's the

19

most efficient at that point.

20

Now, if you look at my $180 billion that I've

21

just spent on building this network, in the world of

22

TELRIC, I now face the prospect of people springing up on

23

a daily basis who are capable of taking advantage of any

24

new technology and any change in demographics and

25

configuration to beat the efficiency of my network.

the Government has to give me a chance to get that -- a

QUESTION:

Well, but that's just what the cases

10

say you can't do, it seems to me, going back to the

11

Stone's opinion 50 years ago, the opinion of the Court in

12

Duquesne, that you can't attack the methodology unless you

13

can point to something wrong in the actual fee that you're

14

allowed or the rate that you're allowed.

15

MR. BARR:

Well, Your Honor, I think that the

16

Court has always reviewed methodologies.

17

rates can be evidence of a defect in a methodology, but it

18

doesn't have to be.

19

said if the methodology is not compensating you for a

methodological risk to which you are exposed, that's a

problem today, and that is our claim, that the methodology

itself exposes us to a risk of not recovering what we

At that point, you can come in and complain,

MR. BARR:

Well, if -- if we are correct that we

are entitled to a fair opportunity to recover our costs

13

and the Government decides that they're going to spin a

14

roulette wheel, I can't come in and say that's a problem?

assuming that by adopting this particular methodology, it

Don't you have the burden

MR. OLSON:

This Court has said that the

challenger of a rate has a heavy burden to make a

convincing case that the outcome is confiscatory.

14

that burden can't be achieved -- Justice Ginsburg's

We're talking

about replicating particular elements that are available

3

FCC made it clear that we're not talking about -- we're

4

not talking about hypotheticals any more than the embedded

cost system would require allocating hypothetical portions

of something that happened 30 years ago to a rate for --

7

for a particular small portion of a product that may have

nothing to do with that.

And the

What the FCC's order does -- and it explains

10

this in relatively elaborate detail that it's talking

11

about a reasonably available, efficient product in the

12

marketplace that's comparable that can perform a service

13

that's equivalent to the -- the element that may have been

14

built 5 years ago and may be obsolete today or partially

15

obsolete today and may not be efficient.

16

don't do it that way, we will encourage non-competition or

that -- that surely the cost of an equally efficient

substitute must be the maximum of the rate base if prudent

23

investment is to be rejected as a measure.

Now, what the FCC did in this case, it made a

1

they used the other elements based upon these reasonably

2

efficient, effective, available alternatives.

3

Now, the FCC has been criticized.

Well, you're

4

-- you're theoretically inconsistent.

You should have

5

done it all this way or all that way.

The fact is that

6

this Court has said again and again that the ratemaker may

7

make compromises, may have to balance one benefit to the

8

incumbent with one benefit for the competitors.

9

It may -- it doesn't have to be -- the Duquesne

10

case and I think the Hope case involved challenges of

11

methodological inconsistency, and the Court brushed right

12

past that properly because the ratemakers, to solve this

13

hopelessly complex problem, might have to pick something

14

from column A and column B.

15

Now, at the end of the line, I want to make one

16

important point, that even after the State commissions get

17

finished with the process, the FCC included in its order a

18

provision -- it's paragraph 739 -- that specifically said

There's lots

1

of flexibility.

2

At the end of the day, paragraph 739 says,

3

incumbent local exchange carriers may seek relief from the

4

commission's pricing methodology if they provide specific

5

information to show that the pricing methodology, as

6

applied to them, will result in confiscatory rates.

7

So, TELRIC and the FCC's regulation provided

8

lots of opportunities to get to the end of the day the

9

right result in a manner that achieved these various

10

conflicting goals of Congress.

It did it in a way which

11

might not be the best way, although it looks to me like a

12

very conscientious effort to import competition, bring

13

down prices, and to promote technology.

14

But at the end of the day, after the commissions

15

do their job, the expertise that you were talking about in

your dissenting opinion -- at the end of the day the

17

incumbent commission -- exchange carriers can come to

18

court and say it was confiscatory, and they have a remedy.

19

Or before that, they may go to the FCC and they have an

20

opportunity to present their case to the FCC.

This, it strikes me, is the way it should be

done.

It may not be perfect.

MR. VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

I'd like to begin by trying to answer Justice

11

Breyer's question as to why TELRIC was a sensible policy

12

choice by the FCC, and in so doing, I hope also to be able

13

to address Justice Kennedy's concern about whether TELRIC

14

underestimates the cost that a company will face going

15

forward.

16

Justice Scalia's question about whether TELRIC offers a

17

fair opportunity to recover embedded costs.

18

And then if I -- if I can, I'd like to turn to

Paragraph 679 of the local competition order is

19

where the FCC spells out in detail what its rationales

20

were.

21

wanted to adopt TELRIC to send -- to send the right

22

signals to new entrants about when to buy and when to

23

build and to prevent anti-competitive behavior by the

24

incumbent with respect to the pricing of network elements.

25

And that's critical from our perspective.

And what the FCC said in paragraph 679 is that it

As a retail matter, the incumbents have every

2

right, under the State law and Federal antitrust laws, to

3

price their retail offerings in these new competitive

4

markets at their long-run incremental costs.

5

the State laws say.

6

And therefore, if they could charge us the historical

7

costs for these key inputs -- the historical costs for key

8

inputs, when they can charge retail based on their long-

you're well aware of, suggest that by choosing blank

Professor Kahn concedes that.

of capital are.

Now,

2

And that is why, Justice Kennedy, the rate going

3

forward, the TELRIC rate going forward, will not

necessarily be lower than the cost that the incumbents

incurred going forward, because a rate, after all, is a

product of three things:

recover it -- and the cost of capital -- in other words,

what the risk adjustment is.

the rates would be the same or higher depending on how

Now, with respect to their sunk or embedded

here is whether the TELRIC in operation will produce rates

Therefore, in every State in the Union, the incumbents

Justice Scalia, when you adopt one methodology, when you

adopt this methodology here, given the fact that it is an

empirical matter, there's no reason to think there's a

There's no reason to think that the outcome

one than Duquesne because at least in Duquesne, you knew
