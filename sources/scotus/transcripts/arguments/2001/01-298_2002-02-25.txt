CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

of the University System of Georgia.

Mr. Bederman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BEDERMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BEDERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

When a State affirmatively invokes the

12

jurisdiction of the Federal court by removing a case, that

13

acts as a waiver of the State's forum immunity to Federal

14

jurisdiction under the Eleventh Amendment.

15

has been confirmed as recently as this Court's decision in

16

the College Savings Bank case where it was indicated that

17

a State may waive Eleventh Amendment immunity by invoking

18

Federal court jurisdiction.

19

This principle

This rule also finds support in a long line of

20

decisions holding that where a State enters a Federal

21

proceeding as an actor in any role, that effectively

22

relinquishes any objections to Federal jurisdiction a

23

State may have under the Eleventh Amendment.

24
25

QUESTION:

When you say as an actor in any role,

does it ever intervene as a defendant?

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BEDERMAN:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

This

2

Court's precedents seem to indicate that wherever the

3

State is cast in the role of plaintiff, defendant,

4

intervenor, or claimant, that the entry into the Federal

5

proceeding submits the State to the jurisdiction of the

6

Federal court.

7
8
9

QUESTION:

How about the Ford Motor Company

case?
MR. BEDERMAN:

Well, of course, the

10

authorization requirement in Ford Motor -- and that's the

11

particular holding in Ford Motor that I think is of

12

concern to this Court -- need not be reached here because,

13

of course, Ford Motor did not involve a case where a State

14

was actually invoking Federal court jurisdiction.

15

QUESTION:

So --

So, you think a line can be drawn

16

between the State defendant being drawn in as a respondent

17

or involuntarily as opposed to removing and thereby

18

invoking Federal jurisdiction.

19

MR. BEDERMAN:

Yes, Chief Justice.

I think the

20

key element here is precisely the invocation of Federal

21

court jurisdiction.

22

with this Court's rulings in -- in Gardner and in -- and

23

in Gunter and Clark where it's made clear that where the

24

State actually is invoking Federal court jurisdiction, the

25

proper inquiry is not the authority of the State officer

And again, this -- that's consistent

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

or attorney to waive Eleventh Amendment immunity.

2

proper inquiry is whether the State officer or attorney

3

had the power to engage in the litigation conduct leading

4

to the invocation of Federal court jurisdiction.

5

QUESTION:

The

In all -- in all those cases, they

6

were cases in which a State really consented to have

7

litigated against it a Federal claim in a Federal court.

8

And it's hardly surprising, once you agree to that, that

9

you also are agreeing to have related things litigated

10

against you.
But this isn't that.

11

This is a case where the

12

only reason that the State went into the Federal court was

13

so that the individual defendants would be able to invoke

14

their right to have the matter heard in a Federal court.

15

So, why isn't the obvious solution here -- there

16

are only State claims left against the State which doesn't

17

want these heard in the Federal court.

18

agreed to have anything heard there against them.

19

judge, send it back to the State court.

20

here?

21

jurisdiction, pendent claims, but it's an abuse of

22

discretion, at least, not to send it back.

23
24
25

They don't want it here.

MR. BEDERMAN:

They haven't
So,

What's it doing

Call that pendent

If I may make a number of

responses to your question, Justice Breyer.
First of all, I believe this Court's holdings

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

particularly in -- in Richardson, in Gunter do present a

2

situation where -- where a State is entering the

3

proceeding and -- in the role of a defendant and later

4

decides to regret that -- that casting and tries to

5

extricate itself from the proceeding.

6

is authority in this Court's precedents to that extent.

7

So, I think there

To your more general observation in terms of the

8

harm here, in essence, weighing the plaintiff's interest

9

in a single and unitary proceeding in State court, a

10

result which has been the -- this Court's jurisprudence

11

construing 28 U.S.C. 1441(c) for almost a century that --

12

that the removal statute does not entitle defendants to

13

remove and then split up claims --

14

QUESTION:

All right.

Well, that's exactly --

15

what if it's that?

The interest of the plaintiff in

16

having the action against the individuals in the State

17

tried in one place, on the one hand, against the interest

18

of the State having a State matter tried in State court

19

where the State has refused to waive its immunity from

20

Federal jurisdiction.

21

constitutional right; the other happens to be a right of a

22

plaintiff that he wouldn't have anyway if he had brought

23

his suit in Federal court, which is what removal

24

jurisdiction is about.

25

prevail on that one?

That for me is easy.

One is a

So, why doesn't the State clearly

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BEDERMAN:

Well, Justice Breyer, again with

2

respect I think the -- the proper analysis I think closely

3

analyzing the State's professed interests in removing and

4

claiming immunity was, first of all, to engage the

5

expertise of Federal tribunals on questions arising under

6

section 1983 and qualified immunity.

7

QUESTION:

May I stop you there?

Because you

8

mentioned section 1983, and that makes this case terribly

9

puzzling because I thought States were not persons.

10

if you're not subject to suit under 1983 --

11

MR. BEDERMAN:

12

QUESTION:

That -- that's --

That's the basis of -- you're suing

13

the State and the State is not a person within 1983.

14

even if you prevailed 100 percent on your Eleventh

15

Amendment claim that you could remove despite that

16

sovereign immunity claim --

17

So,

MR. BEDERMAN:

So,

Justice Ginsburg, I -- I would

18

remind the Court that, of course, there was relief pled

19

for declaratory relief in the complaint, and under this

20

Court's jurisprudence following from Will, a declaratory

21

relief claim is properly pled in this kind of proceeding.

22

Of course, Will says --

23

QUESTION:

Against the State?

24

was not a person, period, under 1983.

25

a county is, but a State is not.

I thought a State
A municipality is,

It doesn't matter

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

whether it's declaratory, injunctive, whatever.

2

not subject to suit under 1983.

3

MR. BEDERMAN:

They're

Isn't that right?

No, Justice Ginsburg.

Under I

4

believe the footnote in -- in Will and also in the

5

following case, Arizona's Official English case, it made

6

clear that that interpretation of section 1983 of a person

7

for purposes of suit was for money damages and that

8

declaratory and injunctive relief, in order to keep the

9

symmetry, presumably with Ex parte Young, as I believe

10
11
12
13

this Court indicated, was -- was a permissible pleading -QUESTION:
different.

Well, Ex parte Young is something

You're suing the officer, not the entity.

MR. BEDERMAN:

That's right, but recall that not

14

only are the regions being sued here but also individuals

15

in their official capacity and as well as in -- in their

16

individual capacity.

17

QUESTION:

No.

But Justice Ginsburg I think has

18

said the individuals are out of it.

Qualified immunity.

19

We're left with the State.

20

Arizona Official English -- she says, the barrier was not,

21

as the Ninth Circuit supposed, Eleventh Amendment immunity

22

which the State could waive.

23

creates no remedy against a State.

24

Court held.

25

So, you have no Federal claim against the State, and your

She wrote for the Court in

The stopper was that 1983
Now, that's what the

So, 1983 creates no remedy against a State.

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

other Federal claims are disposed of.

2

So, we're left with a purely State matter in the

3

State court -- in the Federal court, and the State says,

4

remand this, send it back.

5

MR. BEDERMAN:

Now, why shouldn't they?

Well, again, my response to that

6

would be plaintiffs do have an interest in seeing -- in

7

filing a single, unitary action in State court, as was

8

properly done here.

9

attempted to accomplish via its removal and claiming

And what the State of Georgia has

10

immunity tactic is -- is to break the -- break the

11

plaintiff's claim into discrete parts and dispose of them.
QUESTION:

12

I don't understand that either.

13

What's very puzzling here is you wanted the case to be in

14

State court, and then it was removed.

15

remand, didn't you?

16

MR. BEDERMAN:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

want.

You moved to

That's correct.

And now you're getting just what you

You're getting the remand and you don't want it.
MR. BEDERMAN:

Well, it's -- it's the remand

20

apparently with the -- the other consequences of the

21

Federal court decisions to date.

22

unfortunately one of the consequences of litigating

23

Eleventh Amendment immunity is that this was taken as an

24

interlocutory appeal, and other proceedings of course have

25

occurred since then.

That's, of course,

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

But there's been no kind of

2

adjudication on the merits against the State -- against

3

the State entity in any way, shape, or form.

4

MR. BEDERMAN:

No.

You are correct, Justice

5

Ginsburg.

6

district court as affirmed by the court of appeals on the

7

qualified immunity defense as against the -- the

8

private --

9

To date, there have only been rulings by the

QUESTION:

May I ask why it proceeded -- let me

10

read you something else from one -- a fairly recent

11

opinion.

12

whether the Eleventh Amendment forbids a particular

13

statutory cause of action to be asserted against States,

14

the question whether the statute itself permits the cause

15

of action it creates to be asserted against States.

16

didn't the lower courts follow that procedure and -- and

17

decide the 1983 substantive issue of whether the State is

18

liable first?

We have routinely addressed, before the question

MR. BEDERMAN:

19

Why

I -- I do not know, Justice

20

Scalia.

In terms of -- in terms of what I understand is

21

the briefing and argument, the State of Georgia did raise

22

the Will defense in its papers.

23

to proceed with the case on another ground, dismissing the

24

section 1983 claims against the private parties in their

25

individual capacities on qualified immunity.

The district court chose

Maybe there

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was some concern about the status of the Board of Regents,

2

but -- but I'm as mystified, frankly, as you are about

3

that disposition.

4

Again, if I may repeat, the concern that

5

petitioner ultimately has about the use of removal and

6

claims of immunity in this context is it splits claims

7

which seems to be a result that's specifically prohibited

8

by the removal statute and this Court --

9

QUESTION:

But that seems to be a purely

10

academic question not in this case because the qualified

11

immunity question, as I understand it, was decided against

12

the individual officers.

13

this goes back to what Justice Breyer asked.

14

any Federal question left in this entire case.
MR. BEDERMAN:

15
16

So, what Federal question -I don't see

If -- if you're not taking well

my point about the availability of declaratory relief -QUESTION:

17

Well, at least the footnote that was

18

read didn't make any distinction based on declaratory

19

judgment.

It said a State is not a person for 1983

20

purposes.

Period.

21

You're telling me now that I was wrong.

22
23

That's what that footnote said.

MR. BEDERMAN:

I would never presume such,

Justice Ginsburg.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. BEDERMAN:

I -- I think maybe the safest

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

result -- of course, this has not been briefed -- is

2

whether this Court's judgment in Will and subsequently in

3

Arizonans for an Official English reaches this precise

4

issue that I'm speaking to.

5

Professor Lapides' request for declaratory relief.

6

briefing has been accomplished on that, and there's been

7

no --

8
9
10

QUESTION:

No

But if you're not right about 1983,

assume now that a State is not a person for purposes of
1983.

11

MR. BEDERMAN:

12

QUESTION:

13

No lower court has addressed

Yes.

Then what Federal element -- what

Federal question is left in the case?

14

MR. BEDERMAN:

15

QUESTION:

There would be none left.

And then with all the Eleventh

16

Amendment jurisprudence in the world, it would make sense

17

for any district judge to hang onto a case that at the

18

threshold had all the Federal elements taken out of it and

19

has nothing but State claims left.

20

MR. BEDERMAN:

Certainly after these

21

proceedings, that might be the result that a district

22

court judge in the exercise of -- of its discretion may

23

wish to -- to achieve.

24

that when Georgia invoked the jurisdiction of the Federal

25

courts for removal, it should have been with the

Our concern is precisely the one

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

understanding that all claims would move to Federal court,

2

that the State could raise whatever defenses it wished to,

3

in other words, the defenses travel to Federal court.

4

what is not a permissible result is, in essence, the --

5

the splitting of claims, the disposition to Federal court

6

and then --

7

QUESTION:

But

I don't see how that -- how your

8

client is in any way harmed by any of this because he ends

9

up with what he wanted is his suit in State court.

10

MR. BEDERMAN:

Well, if I may make a broader

11

point.

The Eleventh Circuit's judgment, from which appeal

12

is sought here, is not entirely clear about this

13

distinction between barred and non-barred claims.

14

was not, of course, settled in any further proceedings in

15

the district court as to whether now the State claims

16

would proceed by remand back to State court.

That

Of course, the State of Georgia sought the

17
18

dismissal of the entirety of Professor Lapides' case under

19

rule 12(b)(6) when it removed the case.

20

now -- not entirely clear at the outset what Georgia's

21

intentions were in removing the case and then seeking

22

immunity.

23

So, it's -- it's

Our proposition is simply that, as a matter of

24

not only judicial efficiency but also the integrity of the

25

removal statute and the fair meaning and understanding of

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this Court's Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence, is that

2

when a State invokes Federal court jurisdiction under the

3

Eleventh Amendment, the entire case then moves to Federal

4

court and that the State cannot, thereafter, claim

5

immunity from the jurisdiction of the Federal courts in

6

those circumstances.

7

If the State does not have the authority -- and

8

this was an earlier question -- under Ford Motor Company

9

to waive the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity via

10

removal, the proper course should have been in this case

11

simply for -- to find the removal was void ab initio and

12

have the entire matter remanded -QUESTION:

13

But that's the end result you're

14

getting.

15

different label put on it.

16

wanted a suit in State court.

17

there's no Federal element left.

19
20
21

You're getting a remand and you want to have a

MR. BEDERMAN:

But the bottom line is you
That was removed.

There --

I can't imagine a

Well, again, I would not presume

to anticipate the future proceedings and that may -QUESTION:

Well, your legal position is

22

basically that a State should not be able to talk out of

both sides of its mouth I guess.

Eleventh Amendment immunity.

It should not be able to

Now, how much of that

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

argument is still valid after what's happened in this case

2

I'm not sure.

3

MR. BEDERMAN:

Well, I think even though

4

petitioner is, understandably, reluctant to introduce an

5

idiom of judicial estoppel into these proceedings with --

6

with obviously the clear indication that rules of estoppel

7

tend not to run against the sovereign, but again that is

8

precisely our concern.

9

In the matter of -- of the -- the symmetry and

10

parity that occurs that when a State enters a Federal

11

proceeding, it submits the entire case to the -- to the

12

jurisdiction of the Federal courts.
QUESTION:

13

May I ask you, Mr. Bederman?

In the

14

brief in opposition to the certiorari petition, did anyone

15

point out the fact that maybe the State was not a person

16

within the meaning of 1983 and that that was the reason

17

not to take the case?
MR. BEDERMAN:

18

Well, if I may review quickly.

19

Yes.

And I do recall that the State did raise in its op

20

cert at page 10 the argument under Will.

21

do opine that Will would -- would act against the -- the

22

claims raised for monetary relief by petitioners here.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. BEDERMAN:

25

I -- yes.

They

They're only after monetary relief.
I would not want to put that

gloss on -- on the States.

I'm reading just an isolated

2

essence, the -- the open question.

3

That -- that is, in

If I could return, Chief Justice Rehnquist, to

4

your -- to your observation.

Again, while we don't think

5

it's necessary for the Court to rule on any judicial

6

estoppel principles, clearly this is an appropriate case

7

to draw a bright line rule in terms of States invoking

8

Federal court jurisdiction.

9

authority to do so and waive Eleventh Amendment immunity

Either they have the

10

and the entire case proceeds to Federal court or the State

11

officials or lawyers do not have that authority and the

12

proper disposition is remand.

13

If I may reserve the balance of my time.

14

QUESTION:

15

Mr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.

Very well, Mr. Bederman.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

18

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

19
20
21

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
For four reasons, a State's removal of a case to

Federal court waives its forum immunity, permitting

23

adjudication of the claims against the State in Federal --

24
25

QUESTION:

Explain to me whether we've ever

bifurcated forum immunity from immunity for suit -- from

suit?

2

I just -- do we treat the two differently?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

They are both protections that

3

are afforded by the Eleventh Amendment.

4

has both of those rights under the Eleventh Amendment.

5

Certainly a State

But the question is the State can waive one

6

without waiving the other, and that's what it did here, by

7

selecting a forum, Federal forum, for the adjudication of

8

QUESTION:

Mr. Gornstein, may I deflect you?

21

Because I got from your brief the notion that this case is

22

academic, and let me read you from page 23, note 8.

23

question whether a State that removes a case waives its

24

immunity to constitutional claims is largely academic.

25

Section 1983 does not authorize a suit against a State in

were telling us in that footnote that whatever is said

about the removal, this case goes because the State is not

subject to 1983.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

It seems to me that you

To the extent that there are

6

constitutional claims against a State, that's correct.

7

the extent that there are State law claims against the

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Correct, and that would argue

more strongly in favor of the district court exercising

10

its discretion in that direction, assuming there's no

11

other Federal claim in the case.

12

that briefly because it is our understanding that a suit

13

against a State official in his official capacity for

injunctive or declaratory relief is not a suit against the

State and it is a suit against the person under -- under

I don't understand the difference

between a claim against the State itself and the claim

MR. GORNSTEIN:

MR. GORNSTEIN:

15

I think it's -- it's largely

16

true that he wants a money judgment, but there is one

17

allegation in his complaint upon which he relies in saying

18

that he's also seeking declaratory relief against an

individual -- an individual officer in his official

So, that's like suing the State.

That would be the question

whether there is an abuse of discretion.

And the principle that --

Are you saying that it's a different

if the same factual circumstance had occurred in the case

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I am, Mr. Chief Justice, because

9

under this Court's decision in Pennhurst, if a plaintiff

10

files a suit in Federal court that includes both Federal

11

law claims and State law claims, the State law claims

12

against the State are -- have to be dismissed under

13

Pennhurst.
But the situation is different.

14

This plaintiff

15

did just what the Pennhurst opinion suggested that he

16

should do, which is to file his claims against the State

17

under State law in State court.

18

added his Federal law claims so that he could have a

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

State is effectively seeking to accomplish that goal.

2

Now, it says it needs to do that because it

wants to get the benefit of a Federal forum for its State

employees.

But the -- just because the State has a

It's still a

It's also a little surprising to hear the State

10

say that it needs to have a Federal forum for its State

11

officials on Federal law issues when the State has

12

repeatedly and successfully argued to this Court that

13

State courts are fully competent and just as competent as

14

Federal courts to adjudicate Federal law issues.

15

And it's -- it's particularly surprising that

16

the State thinks it's in the State's interest for its

17

employees to get an interlocutory appeal in Federal court

18

when the State's own policy is that they aren't entitled

19

to an interlocutory appeal.

Well, the State is certainly entitled

to make a tactical judgment --

MR. GORNSTEIN:

it has to accept the consequences of that choice, which is

the Federal court then has authority to adjudicate the

entire case that has been brought before them -- before

it.

6

I wanted to say a word about the -- the Ford

7

Motor Company case because in the Ford Motor Company case,

8

the Court did deem State law authority to consent to be

9

the critical issue.

But all other decisions in which the

10

Court has addressed the invocation issue, the Court has

11

held that an individual when -- I mean, when a State

12

invokes Federal court jurisdiction, it waives immunity as

13

a matter of Federal law.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MS. ORLAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

20

The State, along with its employees, removed

21

this case to Federal court so that its employees could

22

take advantage of a -- in a Federal forum.
This does not amount to a waiver for two

23

reasons.

expression of the State's desire to waive its immunity,

5

MS. ORLAND:

Is there such a

6

made such a distinction, and the first I've ever heard of

7

the concept of forum immunity being parceled out from the

8

rest of the immunity was in this case.

was a recognition at some point by the petitioner in this

case that the Federal claims would be barred even in State

court, and then they've come up with this forum immunity

concept.

13

QUESTION:

It's not -- it's -- I mean, the

14

concept has been around.

15

a State does not -- just because a State is willing to be

forum, although you're not immune from the suit entirely.

22

MS. ORLAND:

Your Honor, that is exactly what

23

the Court found in Pennhurst, but I would suggest that the

MS. ORLAND:

MS. ORLAND:

And -- and you're not going to

statute, just as the sovereign immunity doctrine, although

7

it's not in the Eleventh Amendment, is there.

8
9

So, it's as good as if it were in the

MS. ORLAND:

Your Honor, all that is true.

But

Congress also contemplated the remand of certain claims.

10

And the only thing the State is asking in this case is for

11

the case to be treated as if it were originally filed in

12

Federal court, which it is our belief is the true intent

13

of the congressional removal statute.

14

partial claims to be brought up, and the reason they

15

didn't allow for it is because of the court's potential

16

exercise of supplemental jurisdiction.

17

They didn't allow

But in this case, there can be no exercise of

18

supplemental jurisdiction simply because the legislature

19

for the State of Georgia has not waived its sovereign

20

immunity as to the Georgia Tort Claims Act for actions

21

within the courts of the United States.

22

So, in this case, by the exercise of a

23

procedural device, the attorney general would not be only

24

overriding the very principles established in the concepts

25

of federalism, but would also be overriding the -- the

31
Alderson Reporting Company

decisions of the State legislature and the Georgia

constitution.

QUESTION:

Ms. Orland, then it seems to me the

4

obvious thing that the zealous representative of the State

5

would say is, sorry, we can't join in the removal

petition.

7

going to engage in any subterfuge.

We -- it's just as

8

though it were brought originally.

It would be no good.

So, we are not going to go through the sham of signing our

can't be brought in Federal court.

12

adjudicate this, it had no business signing on to any

If the State were

concerns of the Court regarding the concept of saying

would have applied even if you had been the only defendant

16

in the State court.

17

then having gotten into Federal court, you moved to

18

dismiss on grounds of sovereign immunity, which is absurd.

19

But what you're asking for is the general

And you removed to Federal court, and

absurd, and that type of behavior could be sanctioned by

sanction the behavior if you're saying that it's lawful.

I don't understand that.

Your Honor, if it -You're saying, counsel, you have

exercised every right that we can give you under the law.

We're now sanctioning you for doing that.

MS. ORLAND:

That -- I don't

I'm sorry if I misspoke.

If a

lawyer is going to remove a case and do it for the

11

purposes of delay or some other misconceived purpose --

QUESTION:

Lawyers do all sorts of things for

the purposes of delay.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MS. ORLAND:

16

QUESTION:

And it's improper.
I'm not -- I'm not sure it is.

I

17

think in many cases an attorney will look at two different

18

choices, particularly if you're a defendant, and you'll

19

choose the thing that will delay the case's final

20

resolution.

21

And nothing improper about that.

MS. ORLAND:

There's nothing improper about

22

that, but in the scenario that if it is improper, if it is

23

determined that there is some attempt to elongate

24

litigation for an improper purpose, the court has the

25

discretion to sanction that behavior.

QUESTION:

They're trying to terminate it in a

And I just don't understand how that

could possibly be sanctionable conduct if we say it's a

proper usage of the removal statute and it doesn't waive

9

sovereign immunity.

10

They'll do it all the time.

MS. ORLAND:

Your Honor, I'm not saying we did

11

anything improper.

I'm saying that in the event that

12

somebody did do something improper, that's sanctionable.
QUESTION:

13

Yes, but the question is whether this

14

particular maneuver is -- is authorized by law or not.

15

And if it's authorized by law, it surely isn't improper.
QUESTION:

16
17

Indeed, it would be improper not to

take advantage of it.

QUESTION:

Sure.

QUESTION:

You should be sanctioned as

State litigator, Your Honor.

And that's exactly the

point.

2

You're right.

All of the Federal claims are

3

gone.

Even if you read at joint appendix 17 the

4

plaintiff's assertion that he is seeking declaratory

5

relief, which I would suggest is not a clear statement of

6

declaratory relief -- it is a request for declaratory

7

relief under State law.

QUESTION:

So, if the Court --

It just occurred to me that maybe

there is sanctionable conduct here because you have a

conflict of interest.

So, maybe you should have gotten separate

MS. ORLAND:

14

Your interest in the employees is

Well, Your Honor, in fact at some

15

point in this litigation we did.

But at the initial point

16

of the removal, there was no reason to.
And I think this goes to Justice Kennedy's

17
18

concurrence in Wisconsin, which is if the State is going

19

to be placed in some tactical disadvantage, this rule

20

should not be adopted.
The tactical disadvantage in this case is quite

21
22

simple.

The State would be at odds with its employees.

23

The State would not be in a position where there is no

24

Eleventh Amendment protection as to some claims perhaps --

25

or it hasn't been decided yet for ADA Title II claims --

types of issues and have the fastest course to this Court

The State would be at odds with its

employees because the employees want an interlocutory

Yes, Your Honor.
That -- that sort of thing arises

Do you move for a change of venue or not in a

as Justice Stevens said, perhaps a lawyer ought not to

have multiple defendants if they're going to have

different -- different approaches to the thing.

14

MS. ORLAND:

And

Well, Your Honor, I think that's --

15

that's exactly the point here is -- and also the point as

2

good reason because of a conflict of interest?

3

-- your position is that it will never waive sovereign

immunity?

MS. ORLAND:

Or is your

Your Honor, the only time that it

could waive sovereign immunity is if the State legislature

says I authorize the attorney general --

QUESTION:

No.

Absent a State legislature --

you're arguing for a general rule, not just for a rule
that will protect you in this particular case.

11

MS. ORLAND:

12

QUESTION:

That is correct.
Well, a general rule.

My goodness.

13

Suppose the State comes in and they have four claims and

14

they -- they wanted -- they say, oh, I have a great idea.

15

I'm going to get this claim litigated over here in the

16

Federal court and there are three related claims.

choose.

start waiving answers to one question and related

questions are going to be waived too.

It's a

MS. ORLAND:

Your Honor, in all the cases relied

upon by the petitioner where the State has come into

I -- I want to ask you a -- a

kind of question which is subsumed -- a narrower question

which is subsumed within the broader one, and that is

let's -- let's put this situation aside and assume that we

have the -- the conflict-free situation in which the

employees have their own counsel and the -- the State is

-- is represented simply by -- by separate counsel.

11

employees want to remove and the State, as -- as a

12

defendant separately represented, agrees to the removal.

13

On your theory, as I understand it, the State would still

14

be able at a later time to claim its immunity because the

15

legislature had not authorized that removal.

correct?

Is that

hasn't authorized the removal.

Now, in that situation

then, how do you answer the argument that came up in the

opportunity to sit back and see how things go?

6

-- if the case turns out well for them, they can claim the

simply say, yup, that's a great position to be in and

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIE C. PARSLEY

9

ON BEHALF OF TEXAS, ET AL.,

10
11
12
13

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
MS. PARSLEY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The decision to waive sovereign immunity and

14

consent to suit traditionally rests with the State's

15

legislature, a body uniquely able to both balance

16

challenges to the public fisc and determine when such a

17

waiver is both in the citizens' will and the public good.

18

QUESTION:

Have we inquired, when States bring a

19

suit in Federal court, whether the State attorney general

20

has authority to appear?

21

in Federal court and you're subject to a counterclaim.

22

Have we -- have we asked district judges to inquire

23

whether the State attorney general has authority to waive

24

sovereign immunity?

25

MS. PARSLEY:

Because, you know, when you come

No, Your Honor, the Court has not.

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

We have not.

And -- and is it your

2

position that as soon as a counterclaim is filed, what?

3

The whole suit has to be dismissed or -- or what -- what

4

happens then?

5

MS. PARSLEY:

No, Your Honor.

Our position

6

would be that as to the -- the specific compulsory

7

counterclaim that may be litigated against the State as a

8

plaintiff, that is permissible to the extent of the res.

9

In other words, when the State comes in as a plaintiff --

10
11
12
13
14

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

To the extent -- I didn't

hear the word.
MS. PARSLEY:

The res, the subject matter of the

litigation.
QUESTION:

So, you say the attorney general,

15

even though he has no power to waive State sovereign

16

immunity, can achieve a waiver of State sovereign immunity

17

by bringing suit which is subject to a compulsory

18

counterclaim.

19

MS. PARSLEY:

He does have the authority to

20

represent the State, and presumably he has the authority

21

also by the legislature to bring the cause of action that

22

he is asserting with the State as a plaintiff.

23

QUESTION:

So, the same here when -- when he

24

doesn't have authority to waive sovereign immunity, but he

25

has authority to remove to Federal court.

And if that

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

results in a waiver of sovereign immunity, so be it.

2

MS. PARSLEY:

But the two are specifically

3

different because, as a defendant, you're looking at this

4

-- it would be an implied waiver as opposed to an express

5

waiver.

6

been admitted, they are not -- they are also subject to

7

waiver for compulsory counterclaims to the extent of the

8

res.

As a plaintiff, even the United States, it has

It has been --

9

QUESTION:

Why isn't that an implied waiver too?

10

Brings suit -- the -- the State brings suit in Federal

11

court is subject to a counterclaim.

12

that the State is -- is subject to adjudication of that

13

counterclaim.

14

just an implied waiver from bringing the action in Federal

15

court.

16

And you're saying

Now, there's no express waiver there.

It's

Why isn't removal the same?
MS. PARSLEY:

Well, that is the situation that

17

occurred in Gardner, Your Honor, for the -- for the proof

18

of claim instance with bankruptcy litigation.

19

-- so, it is not -- and it's not been seen as an implied

20

waiver because the State has put in issue the res and the

21

subject matter of the litigation.

22

But in this case --

23

QUESTION:

And that is

Well, you speak of the res of the

24

litigation.

Supposing the State simply wants to collect a

25

bad debt from somebody.

There's no res.

Maybe he doesn't

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

have anything at all.

But it simply wants a money

2

judgment against him for $100,000.

3

MS. PARSLEY:

4

then the State would be able --

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. PARSLEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

That would be --

There's no -- there's no res there.
But it is the subject matter of

7

the litigation; that is, his -- that would be what the

8

State would be adjudicating.

9

In this instant, what distinguishes it is that

10

the State is not transformed from a defendant to a

11

plaintiff when it removes to Federal court, and the

12

literal text of the Eleventh Amendment proscribes cases

13

prosecuted against a State.

14

QUESTION:

What happens under State law, say, in

15

Texas if -- it's a tort action.

16

Everybody in your office thinks that there is no sovereign

17

immunity, but just before the jury is about to come in,

18

somebody dredges up a statute and says, oh, my God, we had

19

sovereign immunity.

20
21
22

It's against the State.

We forgot to make the defense.

MS. PARSLEY:

The Texas Supreme Court has held

that sovereign immunity is subject matter jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

So, in other words, you can come in

23

in Texas, a jury is about to come in, you're just about to

24

lose the case, the last minute you discover this defense,

25

and just they'll -- they'll dismiss the case?

But that -- and that is.

You put your finger on

the point that some -- that people dislike about sovereign

Well, that's the State's own fault.

18

I mean, the State could have an interlocutory appeal if it

19

chose to do so, couldn't it?

20

MS. PARSLEY:

They could, but in the Johnson

21

case, of course, this Court stated that the State courts

22

do not have to have a parallel system similar to the

23

Federal courts.

24
25

QUESTION:

I take it the State of Texas is not

asserting that its courts are less capable of interpreting

50

1

Federal law than Federal courts are?

2

MS. PARSLEY:

3

Kennedy.

4

that regard.

5
6

Not at all.

QUESTION:

And we don't mean any disrespect in

In fact, you prefer your

interpretation of Federal law, don't you?

7

(Laughter.)

8

QUESTION:

9

Not -- not at all, Justice

It seems to me everything that you've

said leads to the conclusion that this was a non-removable

10

case from day one and that the State should not have --

11

should not have joined that removal petition.
MS. PARSLEY:

12

Actually that -- we do not agree

13

with that because there's no clear statement in the

14

removal statute indicating that the State would have

15

waived its immunity had it removed.

16

section 5 power on behalf of Congress to actually abrogate

17

the State's immunity.
QUESTION:

18

Also, there's no

So -I don't get -- I don't get it all.

19

If the State is immune from suit in the Federal court,

20

then it seems to me it follows it has no authority to

21

remove the case to the Federal court.

22

action.

23

then say, Federal court, you don't have power to hear it.

24

It seems the two go together.

25

State is not amenable to suit in Federal court, the State

It can't initiate

It can't say, Federal court, hear this case, and

If the Federal -- if the

51
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is not positioned to remove the case to Federal court.

2

MS. PARSLEY:

But that would be similar to the

3

-- to the argument they made in Schacht in that you cannot

4

remove a case with barred claims.

5

does not prohibit the State -- States from removing --

6

QUESTION:

The removal statute

Not barred -- the statute of

7

limitations is a defense.

You're saying that the -- the

8

State has not consented to suit.

9

consent to suit in Federal court, it seems to me it's in a

As long as it doesn't

10

non-removable position in the State court because either

11

it's going to consent or it's not going to consent.

12

doesn't consent, it -- it doesn't have any authority to

13

remove.
MS. PARSLEY:

14

If it

Well, it may be a fine

15

distinction, but consenting to the removal, we would argue

16

and is argued in the briefs, is not the same thing as

17

consenting to waive our Eleventh Amendment immunity.

18

only way we could actually waive our Eleventh Amendment

19

immunity is if we were vested with that power by the

20

legislature.

21

Ford Motor Company, that's the appropriate analysis that

22

the court would engage in, whether we were --

And Texas is not, Georgia is not.

QUESTION:

23

The

And under

What -- what do you think is at stake

24

now?

On the -- I think that you did -- you did bring up

25

the question of 1983 liability, that there -- that this

52
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was not a Federal case to begin with.

2

right?

3

MS. PARSLEY:

Is that -- is that

I believe that -- that Georgia,

4

when they moved -- when they answered, they both raised

5

Will and the Eleventh Amendment in their answer.

6

correct.

7

QUESTION:

That is

So, it seems to me that we are

8

arguing over an academic question because no matter what,

9

this case is going to return to the Georgia State court.

10

MS. PARSLEY:

It's not academic on this -- for

11

this point.

This is really a reinvigoration of the

12

implied waiver doctrine that the Court fully rejected in

13

College Savings Bank.

14

to the market participation theory.

15

market participation theory, the State was held as having

16

waived its immunity because it voluntarily engaged in an

17

activity -QUESTION:

18

This is -- the analogy is parallel
In the market --

Yes, but all those could be very

19

interesting questions.

20

look at this case, is it goes back to the State court.

21

So, if -- you -- you had said initially no 1983 liability.

22

Right?

And that the Federal court should --

23

MS. PARSLEY:

24

QUESTION:

25

The bottom line, no matter how you

Yes, Your Honor.

And I had thought that in the recent

case we had said if you have that picture, the Federal

53
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

court is supposed to deal with the 1983.

2

Vermont Agency?

3

MS. PARSLEY:

4

statutory question.

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. PARSLEY:

7

Wasn't it

Yes, Vermont Agency.

The

Yes, right.
That it could be dealt with first,

yes.

8

QUESTION:

Right.

9

MS. PARSLEY:

That is entirely possible, and the

10

district court -- it would have been well advised to have

11

done that, but the district court did not choose to do

12

that.

Instead, it ruled on the Eleventh Amendment.
QUESTION:

13

But in any -- any way you look at

14

this, the case ends up in -- in the State court.

15

seems to me that you really are arguing an academic

16

question.

17

MS. PARSLEY:

So, it

Well, to the extent that the

18

petitioner is challenging the Eleventh Circuit's judgment,

19

they do want to remain in Federal court.

20

therefore, they are actually challenging the judgment and

21

not just the opinion.

22

on appeal.

23

And so,

So, there is a justiciable question

I did want to say quickly that in relation to

24

the implied waiver doctrine, that a State shouldn't have

25

to choose between what is an otherwise legal activity,

54
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

which is removal, and the forfeiture of its immunity.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BEDERMAN

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

Thank you, Ms. Parsley.

MR. BEDERMAN:

If I may, Justice Ginsburg, I was

7

not entirely as helpful as I could have been in response

8

to your earlier lines of questioning.

9

assistance to the Court.

10

If I can be of

Professor Lapides, in his complaint, alleged

11

declaratory grounds and declaratory relief at -- at pages

12

-- joint appendix pages 17 and 19.

13

And a review of the district court's first order

14

at petition appendix 27a, while admittedly the -- the

15

holding is not entirely crystal clear, in terms of

16

reserving the claims against individuals in their personal

17

capacity, although no mention is made of the nature of the

18

relief, the cases cited by the district court maybe are

19

indicative that in the district court's mind was the open

20

question of the availability of declaratory relief.

21
22

QUESTION:

Are you talking about paragraph 26 of

the complaint?

23

MR. BEDERMAN:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes, sir, I am.

Well, that just says, I want a

judicial finding that what Kansas did amounts to

55
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

defamation.

2

State law.

3

I take it that's a defamation claim under
What has that got to do with it?

MR. BEDERMAN:

Well, I think, of course, all

4

paragraphs in a complaint need to be read together in view

5

of the earlier allegations, in view of this course of

6

conduct interfering with Professor Lapides'

7

constitutionally granted due process rights at both

8

paragraphs 1 and at paragraph 8 of the complaint.

9

when read together, paragraph 26 fairly raises in terms

10
11

I think

of -QUESTION:

Read them together.

I just read it.

12

What he says is I want a judicial finding that Kansas

13

State action gives rise to a new -- is defamatory, thereby

14

giving rise to a new cause of action every time the

15

information is published.

16

states a Federal claim.

17

want to hear it.

18

MR. BEDERMAN:

Okay?

Read it together so it

I'm not saying you can't.

No.

I just

I'm not sure on the bare

19

terms of paragraph 26 that the request for declaratory

20

relief is particularly tied to a Federal cause of action.

21

All I can point the Court to is both paragraphs 1 and 8 of

22

the complaint which frame the Federal question.

23

If I may, in terms of -- of a second point,

24

about the concern for tactical disadvantage that the State

25

may be put in, if the Court rules either that removal

56
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

constitutes waiver, that the Georgia Supreme Court in a

2

1994 decision made clear that denials of qualified

3

immunity defenses are subject to immediate certification

4

for appeal by trial court judges.

5

extravagant to suggest that under Georgia law currently

6

that there is no effective mechanism for the review,

7

immediate review, of -- of denials of qualified immunity

8

defenses.

9

page 11 filed by the petitioner.

10

So, I think it's

And this is more fully explained at reply brief

If I may make one last point, and that is by no

11

means is petitioner asserting that by virtue of removal,

12

plaintiffs become defendants and defendants become

13

plaintiffs.

14

removal is a forum selection, that when the State engages

15

in that forum selection, it is waiving, for purposes of

16

the case and the authority of the Federal courts to

17

adjudicate, the State's forum immunity under the Eleventh

18

Amendment.

Instead, our submission is simply that

19

If there are no other --

20

QUESTION:

Well, I don't mean to pursue a red

21

horse.

22

Where in paragraph 1 or 8 does it ask for a declaration?

23

I just don't want to miss something if it's there.

MR. BEDERMAN:

It does -- neither paragraph 1

24

nor 8 specifically refers to declaratory relief.

If you

25

-- if you flip to the prayer for relief at pages 18 and

57
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

19, of course, most of it is for -- for monetary damages.

2

But, of course, the last prayer is for all relief that the

3

court may deem just and proper.
