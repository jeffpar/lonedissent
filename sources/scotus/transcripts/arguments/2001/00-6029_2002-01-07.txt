ORAL ARGUMENT OF LUTHER O. SUTTER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. SUTTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The FMLA guarantees much more than 12 weeks of

12

absence from work.

13

of statutory rights that an employer must grant eligible

14

employees.

15

the case here, may provide different rights from the

16

bundle of rights that the FMLA grants eligible employees.

17

825.208 and 825.700(a) implement the statute in an

18

important way.

19

The FMLA guarantees a specific bundle

In many cases, the company's leave plan, as is

Under the regulations, 825.208 and 700, if the

20

employer wants a period of absences or leave to count

21

against a worker's annual FMLA entitlement, the employer

22

must do three things.

23

grant the worker this bundle of rights that the FMLA

24

grants him or her.

25

employee that they have these benefit rights, and third,

First, the company must decide to

Second, the employer must tell the

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the employer must tell the employee that the employer has

2

elected to count this period of leave against the FMLA.

3

QUESTION:

Does the act require the posting of

4

some general notice in the place of employment about the

5

Family Leave Act?

6

MR. SUTTER:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, it does.

7

U.S.C. 2619 provides that each employer shall post a

8

general notice in the form that the Secretary shall

9

prescribe, so Congress painted it in broad brush strokes

29

10

and intended that the Secretary had the ability to provide

11

what information is provided to employees.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

Well, can the Secretary then provide

that it has to be done by personal communication?
MR. SUTTER:

Well, Your Honor, that is just --

15

as this Court noted in the FDA case, just simply because

16

the Secretary has spoken and required posting in this

17

instance does not mean that the Secretary cannot fill the

18

gap, as it were, and require personal notice if the

19

Secretary determines that such notice is reasonably

20

necessary to implement the act.

21

In this case, Justice O'Connor, I think all

22

would agree that it is difficult to exercise a right that

23

one does not know that one has, and in this case the

24

Secretary decided that the employer must first choose

25

to -- that the FMLA -- that the worker will get the FMLA

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

rights, and then tell the employee, and this regulation

2

promotes communication, communication between the employer

3

and the employee.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Sutter, may I ask if -- in this

5

case, as I understand it, the employee initially did not

6

qualify for the FMLA leave because she hadn't been there

7

long enough.

8

the first 4 weeks had to be under the company policy

9

because there was nothing else, so is the thrust of your

The FMLA is 12 weeks.

Her initial weeks,

10

argument that therefore she is entitled to a minimum of 16

11

weeks, even assuming notice at the time that FMLA comes

12

active?

13

MR. SUTTER:

Justice Ginsburg, the thrust of my

14

argument is, is that the FMLA is more than just 12 weeks.

15

The FMLA is a specific bundle of rights --

16

QUESTION:

Yes, well, that's a separate

17

question, but let's assume that there's no difference in

18

the rights under each, and in this case I don't know that

19

that bundle that you describe is any different under the

20

company plan as far as continuing the insurance and the

21

pension payments, but is it your contention that she would

22

therefore, because she didn't have enough to qualify for

23

the FMLA leave, she would get 16 weeks --

24

MR. SUTTER:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
-- and not 12?

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SUTTER:

Yes, Your Honor, because the act

2

provides that only eligible employees are entitled to FMLA

3

leave, and eligible employees must have worked for that

4

employer for 12 months, and at the --

5

QUESTION:

So it's a little odd that when she

6

didn't qualify she gets extra time than if she had already

7

been there long enough to qualify, in which case it would

8

be only 12 weeks.

9

MR. SUTTER:

Well, I can see where one might

10

believe that it is a bit odd, but again, Justice Ginsburg,

11

the company leave plan in this case did not provide her

12

with all of the FMLA bundle of rights.

13

QUESTION:

Why didn't it?

14

QUESTION:

Why didn't it?

15

MR. SUTTER:

Because the leave plan in this

16

case, for example, did not allow her to have intermittent

17

leave.

18

Section 2612 -QUESTION:

She wasn't able to have intermittent

19

leave anyway, as I understand it.

The doctor didn't allow

20

her to go back to work even intermittently until the

21

period was over.

22

MR. SUTTER:

Well, Justice Scalia, the doctor

23

only had two options.

24

front end not to allow Ms. Ragsdale her bundle of FMLA

25

rights, the doctor had two options.

Because the employer elected on the

Either Ms. Ragsdale

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

quit, or she cannot work for 30 days.

2

option that would have become involved had the employer

3

given the employee notice of a right to --

4

QUESTION:

There's a third

You mean the doctor skewed his

5

medical advice and told her you can't work at all only

6

because the employer hadn't told her she could work

7

intermittently?

I can't imagine that.

8

MR. SUTTER:

9

QUESTION:

Well, it's -The problem I have with your case is

10

not -- not the rule that the employer has to give notice.

11

That's a perfectly reasonable rule.

12

the remedy that is provided if the rule is violated.

13

under that provision of the act which imposes a penalty

14

when the employer fails to comply with the provision of

15

the act, what you're entitled to is damages, what you

16

would have lost, what you've lost by reason of the

17

employer's noncompliance.

18

The problem I have is

In this case, I don't see anything at all that

19

she lost, and the penalty under the regulation that is

20

imposed for noncompliance with the notice is an entire

21

free additional 12 weeks.

22

suffered at all.

23

Now,

MR. SUTTER:

It goes beyond any damages she

Well, Justice Scalia, we -- it is

24

difficult, looking 3, 4 years later, to determine whether

25

or not Ms. Ragsdale would have been able to work

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

intermittently.

We contend that she would have been.

2

However, having said that --

3

QUESTION:

Well, but under the damage provision

4

of the act you have to prove that.

Why isn't it

5

reasonable to say the employer has to make her good for

6

any damages she suffered, and if you could show that she

7

suffered something because of it, fine, but what this

8

regulation says is, she gets a whole nother 12 weeks,

9

whether in fact she could have made use of that notice or

10

not, and as I read the facts I don't see anything she

11

could have done if she had gotten the notice.

12

would have been in the same position she's in now.

13

MR. SUTTER:

I think she

Well, certainly the district court

14

did not address the issue of prejudice.

15

Secretary could have reasonably determined that monetary

16

penalties were appropriate.

17

decided that the FMLA is not simply money to be bought or

18

to be sold or exchanged.

19

rights that the employee has different rights and

20

obligations under.

21

in this case never got FMLA leave because the employer

22

never designated it as FMLA leave.

23

QUESTION:

However, the

However, the Secretary

The FMLA is a specific bundle of

If the employ -- the -- Ms. Ragsdale

But as Justice Scalia points out, the

24

employee under your view gets even more than she's

25

entitled to under the act under certain circumstances.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Suppose that the notice isn't given, and she takes leave,

2

and medical benefits are not paid.

3

has to pay for medical benefits.

4

MR. SUTTER:

5

QUESTION:

I assume the employer

Right.
And also give 12 additional weeks.

6

That seems -- it seems to me that you're having it both

7

ways.

8

MR. SUTTER:

No, Justice Kennedy, I do not

9

believe that we are, because in this case, while the

10

statute explicitly requires 12 weeks of leave in any

11

period, 2612(b)(1) also allows employees to extend that 12

12

weeks over a calendar year using intermittent leave, so

13

looking at this case as simply a calculation of weeks is

14

inaccurate.
QUESTION:

15

But I put you the case in which she I

16

would think would be entitled to back -- to compensatory

17

damages for not having been paid her medical benefits, and

18

in addition, so that during the period that she took off

19

the Government counts that for purposes of monetary

20

liability, but it doesn't count that for purposes of

21

accrued leave, so she's entitled to monetary compensation

22

for the benefits that weren't paid during that unnoticed

23

leave period, and she's entitled to an additional 12

24

weeks.

25

That just doesn't make sense.
MR. SUTTER:

Well, Justice Kennedy, the specific

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

issue here is what happens when the employer provides the

2

employee with less rights than the FMLA bundle of rights

3

provides.

4

When the -QUESTION:

And the answer is that she ends up

5

with more than what the Family Leave Act would have

6

provided.

7

MR. SUTTER:

In this case, Justice Kennedy, in

8

terms of time I believe the Court is correct.

However, in

9

terms of the specific bundle of rights, the issue for this

10

Court to determine is whether or not the Secretary has

11

acted reasonably when, in circumstances such as these, the

12

employee receives less than what she is entitled to

13

specifically.

14

QUESTION:

I don't -- well, I don't agree that

15

that's the issue.

16

she was deprived of any right that she would have been

17

entitled to under the act.

18

she -- had she received the notice she might have worked

19

intermittently, but as far as the medical advice is

20

concerned she couldn't have worked intermittently.

21

you think you have some obligation to provide that she was

22

deprived of some of the benefits of the act?

23

I don't think you've established that

MR. SUTTER:

You're simply asserting that

Don't

The Secretary may have reasonably

24

required that this analysis occur after the need for

25

intermittent leave arose.

However, the Secretary, to

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

avoid just these types of misunderstandings, required the

2

designation to be on --

3

QUESTION:

It's a prophylactic rule that the

4

Secretary has adopted, even though the statute itself, in

5

the provisions that it sets forth for where the employer

6

has failed to comply with the act, does not adopt a

7

prophylactic rule.

8

damages that the employee is entitled to.

9

It says you give the employee the

MR. SUTTER:

Under either a Morning prophylactic

10

rule, or the interpretive powers granted the Secretary

11

under Chevron, we believe the regulation is entirely

12

appropriate because the issue of notice is not addressed.
QUESTION:

13

Well, may I go back to the question

14

of what the damages are?

15

Secretary's view, does the employee get another 12 weeks

16

of leave if the employee does not need another 12 weeks of

17

leave?

18

MR. SUTTER:

19

QUESTION:

On your view, or on the

If the employee does not need -Let's assume the employee is cured.

20

Does the employee then have the right to enjoy 12 weeks

21

off?

22
23
24
25

MR. SUTTER:

Not unless, for example, she is

involved in a serious car accident, another serious -QUESTION:

Well, no, but my hypothesis is that

whatever the reason for the leave was, sickness or

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

pregnancy, be whatever, it's over, so that I take it that

2

the additional 12 weeks, or only an additional 12 weeks,

3

if the person still has some medical or social need for

4

the leave.

5

MR. SUTTER:

6

QUESTION:

That's exactly correct, Justice.
As I understand what Judge McGill

7

said in the Eighth Circuit, he did say that he -- there

8

could be cases where it would be appropriate for this

9

regulation to apply if she could show that she was

10

disadvantaged by not being given the option, so he left

11

that door open if there were some disadvantage.

12

he saw none here.
MR. SUTTER:

13

He said

Yes, and that's an entirely

14

reasonable interpretation, a reasonable alternative to

15

what the Secretary did here, but that is not the -- Judge

16

McGill did not give the Secretary the appropriate

17

deference that she is entitled to in promulgating this

18

regulation.

19

should be made when the intermittent leave may or may not

20

be needed.

This regulation says that determination

QUESTION:

21

But his reason, I understand, was

22

that Congress said 12 weeks, and to interpret that statute

23

that says 12 weeks to mean 24 weeks, or in this case even

24

more than that -- because the company leave was 30 weeks,

25

right?

12
Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

MR. SUTTER:

The company granted 4 weeks pre-

FMLA eligibility and 26 weeks post.

3

QUESTION:

4

conflicted with the statute.

5

MR. SUTTER:

So his view was that the regulation

Well, and as this Court recognized

6

in the FDA case, you cannot read one statute in isolation.

7

You have to also look at not only 2612(a), which says

8

specifically 12 weeks of leave in any 12-month period,

9

thereby leaving it open for, as the Secretary has done in

10

this case, identifying four different ways to calculate 12

11

weeks.

12

can -- the employer can look back 12 weeks if it chooses

13

to do so, or it can look forward.

14

For example, it could be backward-looking.

You

For example, if I have a broken leg -- if I have

15

a broken leg, and then I recover from that, and then I

16

have another serious health condition, you can actually

17

look forward to the forward-looking 12 weeks, the 12-

18

month period, so if you take 12 months out of a calendar

19

you can actually, depending on how you calculate it, have

20

24 weeks of leave, depending on how they may calculate it.

21

Now, I would urge the Court to read 2612(a) in

22

conjunction with 2612(b)(1) which allows intermittent

23

leave, which can extend FMLA leave over a period of 24

24

weeks if they work half-time, 36 weeks if they work three-

25

quarter time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

5

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

6

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

7
8
9

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Secretary of Labor has determined that an

10

employee can derive the maximum benefit from the FMLA only

11

if he has accurate information concerning the act,

12

including the fact that his leave will count against his

13

12-week FMLA entitlement.

14

QUESTION:

To implement that determin --

Mr. Stewart, do you think that that

15

can be met by just posting some general notice saying that

16

any leave taken by an employee is going to require taking

17

FMLA leave first?

18

MR. STEWART:

No, we don't, Your Honor.

The

19

statute itself requires that an employer post notice in

20

such form as is directed by the Secretary.

21

has addressed the type of notice that must be posted for

22

the workforce generally, but the Secretary has also

23

determined that, although the general posting requirement

24

is helpful, an employee who is actually on the point of

25

taking leave for an FMLA-covered purpose needs additional

The Secretary

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

information concerning the rights and responsibilities

2

under the act, so the employer couldn't comply with the

3

regulatory requirement simply by posting a notice for the

4

workforce generally, and the intention here is not to

5

penalize the employer for noncompliance with the

6

regulation.

7

a precondition to effective exercise of FMLA rights is

8

full and complete information concerning the dictates of

9

the act, including the fact that the leave will count

10
11

Rather, the Secretary's determination is that

against the 12-week entitlement.
QUESTION:

That's fine, but where the employee

12

has no FMLA rights, that is to say, where the leave that

13

the employer provides gives the employee everything that

14

the employee would have under the FMLA, why should the

15

employee get another 12 weeks?

16

MR. STEWART:

17

QUESTION:

First, it's not --

The problem is not the requirement --

18

to my mind is not the requirement of notice at the

19

beginning of the leave.

20

Secretary chooses to impose when that notice is not given.

21

MR. STEWART:

It's the penalty that the

Well, first it's not clear in many

22

cases, and it's not clear in this case, whether in fact

23

24

requirements of the act.

25

that the employer's plan doesn't contain a right to

intermittent leave.

2

whether this particular employee could have effectively

3

utilized the FMLA right to intermittent leave if she had

4

known she had it, but the thrust of the --

5

QUESTION:

Now, there's a further question of

Well, I agree that those are

6

questions, but it seems to me those are questions that

7

have to be answered by the person who is seeking to impose

8

a liability on the employer.

9

MR. STEWART:

But the thrust of the Secretary's

10

regulation is that it is better to have a bright line rule

11

than to require the courts to engage in after-the-fact

12

speculative inquiries regarding what might have been done

13

months or years earlier if the requisite notice had been

14

given and this, to the extent this is harsh, it is harsh

15

in the same way that a statute of limitations is harsh.

16

Clearly, when a plaintiff with a meritorious claim has his

17

suit dismissed because he's missed the statutory

18

limitations period by a small number of days, there's an

19

element of unfairness there, but the justification for

20

having a bright line rule is, first a bright line rule is

21

likely to produce --

22

QUESTION:

The statutes of limitations are not

23

imposed by regulation.

24

MR. STEWART:

25

They're imposed by statute.
Certainly, statutory -- statutes

of limitations by definition are imposed by the

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

legislature, but there are instances, and we've cited one

2

in our brief, in which an administrative agency that is

3

given authority to resolve complaints under an act may be

4

authorized to promulgate reasonable procedural regulations

5

to implement that directive, and that might include the

6

requirement that a claim be filed within a certain number

7

of days.

8

QUESTION:

What case is --

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart --

10

MR. STEWART:

This is on page 24 of our brief in

11

footnote 6.

12

Seventh Circuit case that discusses predecessor versions

13

of the current EEOC regulations which provide that Federal

14

employees claiming discrimination under title VII must

15

present their claims to the agency within a specified

16

number of days.

17

We've cited Rennie v. Skerrett, which is a

QUESTION:

But here there's something really

18

strange about it.

19

When she started on leave she wasn't entitled to anything,

20

so here's an employer being more generous than the Federal

21

law requires in that he's covering her although she's

22

worked less than a year, so there's no question of giving

23

the notice when she's put on leave because she's not

24

entitled to any Federal leave, isn't that so?

25

That is, they couldn't give the notice.

MR. STEWART:

Well, first the regulation -- she

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was not entitled to FMLA leave at the time of her first

2

request, but in fact the DOL regulations specifically

3

require that if an employee requests leave for an FMLA-

4

covered purpose but is not yet eligible for the

5

protections of the FMLA, the employer is required to

6

notify the employee of the time when she will become

7

eligible, and second, at any rate, when the employee made

8

her first request for extension of leave she had passed

9

the 12-month period and she was eligible for the

10

protections of the act, and it's true that in terms of the

11

sheer number of weeks of leave that it was willing to

12

give, the company was more generous than the act required,

13

but the fact that an individual or a business goes beyond

14

the requirements of the law in some respects doesn't

15

excuse its noncompliance with other aspects of the law.

16

QUESTION:

I don't see any noncompliance.

You

17

said about the intermittent, that's fuzzy, but they --

18

their leave policy covered the health insurance, covered

19

the pension payments.

20

MR. STEWART:

Well, the intermittent leave is

21

itself important, and again there may be a substantial

22

question as to whether this particular employee could have

23

made effective use of the FMLA right to intermittent leave

24

had she known she had it, and the Secretary might, as the

25

Eighth Circuit suggested, have adopted the regulatory

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

approach under which that would be the dispositive

2

inquiry, but instead the Secretary has chosen to

3

promulgate a bright line rule.

4

QUESTION:

A prophylactic rule, which the

5

statute itself does not do.

6

requires that when an employer violates section 2615 he

7

has to pay damages equal to the amount of, and then it

8

goes through, any wages he lost, salary he's lost,

9

employment benefits he's lost, and the Secretary comes up

10

with this new rule in which it doesn't matter whether the

11

employee's been damaged at all, we're going to impose a

12

prophylactic rule.

13

which an agency is authorized to do that.

14

I mean, section 2617(a)(1)

I don't know any other situation in

MR. STEWART:

Well, in this case the statute not

15

only gives the agency general rulemaking authority but

16

also provides that it will be a violation of the act for

17

an employer to interfere with or restrain an employee in

18

her exercise of FMLA rights and, by its nature, that

19

language presumes that there will be instances in which

20

employer conduct is not in terms prohibited by the act,

21

but is likely to have the practical effect of dissuading

22

or preventing employees from effectively exercising their

23

statutory --

24
25

QUESTION:
guilty of that.

But if she had no rights, he's not

I mean, what this regulation is saying

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is, whether or not the employer in this particular case

2

restrained her exercise of rights, whether or not she

3

could have taken intermittent leave, he's going to have to

4

give her another 12 weeks.

5

MR. STEWART:

Well, under the NLRB, under the

6

NLRB's approach to implementation of the NLRA, the

7

question of whether employer conduct has interfered with

8

or restrained the exercise of protected rights is not

9

resolved by asking whether particular employees were, in

10

fact, deterred from engaging in protected conduct.

11

whether the employer conduct is of a nature that could

12

reasonably be expected to have that effect, and the

13

Secretary's determination is that failing to inform the

14

employee that her time is being counted against the 12-

15

week FMLA entitlement and then dismissing her while she

16

still has the serious health condition will have the

17

practical effect of interfering with, or is likely to have

18

the practical effect of interfering with or restraining

19

her exercise of protected rights.

20

It's

And again, the Secretary could have chosen an

21

approach under which a more case-specific evidence would

22

be offered as to the actual use the employee might have

23

made of the information, but the Secretary was not

24

required to do so, and again, this is comparable to the

25

situation in a statute of limitations situation where, if

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

a suit is filed -QUESTION:

Well, under the statute of

3

limitations, if a district judge throws out a suit because

4

a 2-year statute has run and then the appellate court said

5

no, you -- there was 3 weeks available there and it was

6

filed on time, we don't give them a whole new 2 years.

7

That's what you're doing.

8
9

MR. STEWART:

Well, the analogy to the statute

of limitations is really that, if the statute of

10

limitations has expired, we don't ask whether the

11

defendant could have done anything differently, or whether

12

the defendant was prejudiced by the absence of notice

13

within the 2-year period.

14

hypothetical, though, the situation might also be compared

15

to a tolling provision in a statute of limitations that

16

says the statute will not begin to run until the potential

17

plaintiff has received a particular item of information.

18

The -- for purposes of your

If that were the situation, then the statute of

19

limitations simply doesn't begin to run until the

20

plaintiff knows that, and we don't ask whether the

21

plaintiff would have done anything differently had she

22

received the information sooner.

23

And again, this is not intended as a penalty or

24

even as a penalty for the employer's noncompliance with

25

the regulatory requirement.

Rather, the gist of the

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Secretary's determination is, in order to make effective

2

use of FMLA rights, this sort of information is a

3

precondition, and therefore it's a natural approach to

4

say, until the employee has that information the 12-week

5

period will not begin to run.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, suppose somebody has

7

worked for 5 months but the company has leave that kicks

8

in that early, and then 7 months later would qualify for

9

the FMLA, but -- or has already had much more than the 12

10

weeks of leave, hasn't been given notice because there

11

wasn't any eligibility, what happens then?

12

MR. STEWART:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. STEWART:

May I answer?

Yes.
There's a separate provision in

15

the statute that makes eligibility for FMLA benefits

16

contingent upon having worked 1,250 hours in the preceding

17

calendar year and, therefore, it's likely that an employee

18

who had worked only 5 months and then had been on leave

19

for 7 months would fail to satisfy that requirement.

20

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Stewart.

21

Mr. Bennett, we'll hear from you.

and DOL are defending here today allow employee -- they're

they allow employees the right to, quote, plan leave, to

communicate with each other.

6

this -- these regulations is elevate this right, this

perceived right to plan leave -- if it's a right, it's an

implicit right in the statute, Your Honor.

11

statute to have leave limited to a total of 12 weeks of

leave.
What they have in essence done through this

13
14

regulation is what the most skilled and persuasive

15

legislative body in this country could not do, and that

16

was entitle employees to leave for more than 12 weeks of

17

leave.

18

went through a number of forms before it was eventually

19

passed by Congress.

22

that bill did not pass Congress.

again that deal couldn't pass Congress.

25

Congress clearly attempted to do that.

This leave

The first piece of legislation

The 100th Congress came

It was only when Congress limited the leave to a

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

total of 12 weeks of leave over a 12-month period of time

2

that they were able to pass this particular piece of

3

legislation.

4

and in, more abundantly in the legislative history

5

surrounding this particular statute, that their primary

6

intent and focus was to limit leave to a total of 12 weeks

7

of leave, to grant employees this minimal leave right.

8
9

Congress specifically spoke in the statute

QUESTION:

Suppose -- I suppose that the

Government didn't think of what it was doing as giving an

10

extra 12 weeks of leave.

11

imagine the way they saw it is that we think the employee

12

has to have notice at the time that this counts as his

13

FMLA leave, and what happens if he doesn't get it?

14

doesn't get it, it doesn't count as FMLA leave.

15

very simple requirement and a very simple remedy, and it

16

has the consequence you spoke of, but if that isn't the

17

simple remedy, they shouldn't have done that simple

18

remedy, what, in your opinion, should they have done,

19

assuming the problem?

22

MR. BENNETT:

They didn't see it that way.

assuming that they come across a real problem.

The real

problem is, no, or very few employees, or not many

25

employees notice what's going on until the moment that

1

they have to go for the chemotherapy.

2

worry about leave, and so the agency says, employer, if

3

you want it to count as FMLA leave, tell them

4

specifically.

5

At that point they

Now, we all agree that's fine, and then what

6

happens if you don't?

7

That's all.

8

want to know, if you think that's wrong, what should, in

9

your opinion, the agency have done there instead?

10

Well, they say, it doesn't count.

Now, you think that part is wrong.

MR. BENNETT:

Now, I

Congress specified a monetary

11

penalty.

In the statute itself, Congress said you shall

12

post a notice advising employees of what their rights are.

13

If an employer, Your Honor, does not post a notice at all,

14

doesn't in any way advise their employees of what their

15

rights are under the statute, completely ignores the

16

statutory provision to post this notice, all the

17

employer -- all -- the only penalty the employer gets is a

18

monetary penalty --

19

QUESTION:

In your opinion, it would have been a

20

better remedy if the agency had said, and if you don't

21

tell them, you have to pay them $10,00 cash.

22

your opinion would have -- I imagine a few employers might

23

have objected to that.

24

MR. BENNETT:

25

That, in

I think the -- some employers

might object to the amount of the penalty, Your Honor.

MR. BENNETT:

QUESTION:

I believe --

$5,000 cash to any employee because

4

the notice provision wasn't given, and all small

employers, large employers, any time they fail to -- now,

6

would you have -- you would have preferred that remedy.

7

Do you think most employers would have preferred that

8

remedy?

9

What amount do you think it should have been?
MR. BENNETT:

Well, aside from constitutional

10

issues as a penalty, I believe you have to look at what

11

Congress intended.

12

the notice, and where -- excuse me, get the leave, and

13

Congress specifically provided where -- a notice provision

14

within the statute, and that notice provision, Congress

15

said, if you don't give it, a penalty is appropriate.

16

has now come up with a whole new penalty that far exceeds

understand, to put you in the position of the agency.

20

They're trying to do something, and they're trying to find

21

a remedy for not doing it, and you say it should have been

22

like $5,000 payment, and I want you to see that a lot of

23

people might have thought that was much worse than simply

24

saying, don't count it as leave.

25

it was better.

Some might have thought

So doesn't the agency have a range where

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

they can choose what's reasonable?

2

MR. BENNETT:

I believe the agency does have a

3

range to choose what's reasonable, Your Honor, but I don't

4

believe --

5

QUESTION:

Could the agency choose a monetary

6

penalty?

Could the agency as a matter of administrative

7

discretion impose a penalty, or would that have to come

8

from the -- is that even within the realm of choice that

9

the agency would have?

10

MR. BENNETT:

Well, again, one of the

11

contingents we raise, Your Honor, is that Congress

12

specifically spoke to notice, all the notice that's

13

required under the statute.

14

not have the right to come in and promulgate a regulation

15

that an employer notify an employee specifically and

16

prospectively that they're using leave, but to the extent

17

that they do, to the extent that there's some perceived

18

gap in there where they do have the right to do that, they

19

can't do that where it's manifestly contrary to the

statute.

We contend that the DOL does

MR. BENNETT:

the discretion to determine a -- fashion a reasonable

remedy for the company's failure to provide this notice,

6

but that remedy, Your Honor, cannot exceed --

QUESTION:

Well, what would be reasonable?

The

fine question maybe a question whether the Secretary has

9

authority to do it.

What, other than saying the period

10

doesn't run if you don't give the notice, could the

11

Secretary have done?

Your Honor, I believe the penalty

that the Secretary should have granted in this particular

case, or authorized under this regulation, would be a

15

monetary penalty.

17

Congress said $100 for not telling the

QUESTION:

Would there ever be an instance in

18

which the Secretary, on a case-by-case basis, could say

19

that we are ordering you to grant additional family leave?

20

I.e., suppose the employee knows that his wife is going to

21

have a difficult pregnancy and he says, I'm going to take

22

some time off under the company plan at the early stages

23

and I'll save my family leave for later, and he makes a

24

mistake, and the mistake is compounded by the fact that

25

there was no notice.

Assume that notice is required, and

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that that's valid.

2

which additional leave would be an appropriate remedial

3

step?

4

Would there ever be an instance in

MR. BENNETT:

Your Honor, I'm not sure that

5

there would be. The statute provides that an employer

6

cannot interfere or restrain.

7

that, indeed, because the employer didn't notify, that

8

they've interfered or restrained, the statute provides a

9

cause of action for that, for the courts to determine, and

Where an employee feels

10

I suppose they could file a claim with DOL, and in that

11

situation they may be able to step in and fashion a

12

remedy, but they'd have to show that, indeed, they somehow

13

interfered with --

14

QUESTION:

Well, could that remedy ever consist

15

of granting additional leave?

I suppose, in those situations --

20

by the -- provided the employee had already been given 12

21

weeks of leave under the conditions contained within the

22

statute, Your Honor, that is our contention.

23

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not sure it's incumbent

24

upon you to write a regulation for the agency.

I gather

25

your point is that whatever the remedy provided by the

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

agency, it has to be a remedy that is attached to the harm

2

that has been caused.

3

harm, no foul.

4

anything he's entitled to under the statute, there's

5

simply no basis for remedy at all.

6

I gather your main point is, no

If the employee has not been deprived of

Now, what the remedy might be had the employer

7

shown that the employee could have had intermittent leave,

8

or if there's something else that the employee could have

9

done with notice, that's not the case that you're arguing

10

to us, is it?
MR. BENNETT:

11
12

Your Honor, that's not our

specific case, that's correct.
QUESTION:

13

Well, but it might be the case if we

14

stipulate that in some instances additional leave must be

15

granted.

16

MR. BENNETT:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. BENNETT:

19

QUESTION:

It could be the case --

If we stipulate that.
Correct, Your Honor.

Then what the agency, what the

20

Government is going to say, Department of Labor is, well,

21

since in some instances you grant leave it's just

22

administratively simpler for us to do it this way and you

23

always get the leave.

24

MR. BENNETT:

25

QUESTION:

Again, Your Honor --

So it does make a difference in

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

answering the question whether or not leave can ever be an

2

effective standard.

3

MR. BENNETT:

Your Honor, again, under the

4

statute, you read the statute, you look at the legislative

5

history surrounding the statute, prior to the enactment of

6

this statute Congress specifically noted in the

7

legislative history that the United States stood alone in

8

the industrialized world as not having leave for these

9

particular types of conditions.

Prior to the enactment of

10

this statute, employees in this country didn't have the

11

right to take 1 week of leave.

12

provide that the employees could get the leave.

13

Congress was looking to

For an employee who receives 12 weeks of leave

14

even if the employee doesn't understand that the leave is

15

standing medical leave, what Congress was attempting to do

16

under the Family and Medical Leave Act, Your Honor, will

17

have been satisfied, again assuming, Your Honor, that the

18

leave was for the four conditions that they provide in the

19

statute and that the employer at least granted them 12

20

weeks of leave, held their job open for 12 weeks of leave,

21

did not in any way take away benefits that they had prior

22

to taking the leave, and they helped maintain their health

23

insurance.

24
25

That was what Congress --

QUESTION:

I think there was one argument in the

brief that she could have initially had the company leave

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

when she wasn't eligible yet, and then she could have said

at that point, 4 weeks later when she became eligible for

3

the FMLA leave, she could say, okay, company, stop the

4

company leave.

5

leave, and when I finish that, I'll go back and pick up

6

the rest of my company leave.

That one argument in the brief for petitioner was to that

8

effect, and how do you respond to that?

14

was to be in addition to any company leave.

15

of fact, the statute and the legislative history is

16

replete with references that Congress was well aware that

17

employers out there such as my client had more generous

leave policies.

19

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

had a leave policy that provided for leave, under these

2

circumstances, if an employer had a policy that in all

3

intent and circumstances would allow an employee off for

4

leave for the four conditions they prescribed, if the

5

leave was job-protected, health insurance was maintained,

6

an employee didn't lose any other benefits while they were

7

out on leave, but the employer's leave was only for 10

8

weeks, all this act did was cause -- was augment that

9

employer's policy to require the employer to provide the

10

employee an additional 2 weeks of leave.

11

meant to require the employer to grant the employee an

12

additional 10 weeks on top of the 10 they already --

13

excuse -- 12 weeks on top of the 10 they already had.

14

Congress could have said that in the statute.
QUESTION:

15

This act wasn't

half a week there.

21

For example,

It says, you've got to take your 12 weeks in one
You can't work, you know, half a week here,

MR. BENNETT:

The statute deals with that, Your

22

Honor, in the section dealing with interference.

23

case the employee makes a request that they need

24

intermittent leave, which they have a right to do under

25

the statute.

Congress specifically granted that.

In that

Then,

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

indeed, the employer's policy, to the extent they did not,

2

they would be found -- the leave would not be consistent

3

with family medical leave and you've now interfered with

4

the employees' leave, and then the question becomes the

5

remedy for that interference.

6

QUESTION:

But of course the employee has to

7

know about the -- that particular right in order to invoke

8

it.

9

Going back to Justice O'Connor's question of

10

your opponent, did your client give the statutory -- post

11

the statutory notices?

12

MR. BENNETT:

Yes, Your Honor, we posted the

13

statutory notices, and as a matter of fact, because my

14

client has its own company-provided leave policy, this was

15

within a collective bargaining agreement, and it's also

16

within the employee's handbook, so the employees were

17

aware of it through the collective bargaining agreement,

18

through the employee handbook which was handed out along

19

with the collective bargaining agreement to all employees.

20

The employer, my particular client, Your Honor, has a 5-

21

day orientation process, and on one of those days they

22

specifically go over with employees what their leave

23

rights are on -- for -- with the company, so this employee

24

has notice provisions.

25

QUESTION:

But that notice described the

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

collective bargaining agreement.

2

statutory requirements?

3

MR. BENNETT:

Did it also describe the

I do not believe there was any

4

specific reference to the FMLA notice posting, Your Honor.

5

I -- the employees are shown the bulletin board where all

6

those notices are posted, title VII, wage and hour, and

7

FMLA, but no, they're not specifically -- there's not a

8

specific discussion --

9

QUESTION:

So that to the extent that there may

10

have been a difference between the statutory requirement

11

and the company policy, they would not have been advised

12

of the statutory requirement.

13

MR. BENNETT:

Not by the company, Your Honor,

14

but the statute doesn't require that.

15

here's the way employees should get notice.

16

could have crafted another way for employees to receive

17

notice, but they said notice to the employees shall be

18

made in this manner, and a general employer notice be

19

posted to all employees, the same as the Congress has done

20

for many of our other labor employment law standards.

21

They have said that's the method we find the best to

22

notify employees of their rights.

23

Congress said,
Congress

Employees are notified of their rights under the

24

ADA in the very same manner.

That statute is much more

25

complicated than this particular statute, where an

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

employee who has a disability that could prevent them from

2

working at all, not just for a few weeks but at all, has

3

to know that they have to request an accommodation before

4

an employer has a right to grant you one.

5

merely a notice posting on the bulletin board for the

6

employer, for the employee to know what their rights are

7

in this statute, and this one is no different, Your Honor.

8

DOL has crafted a whole new regulation.

9
10
11

That notice is

This

regulation adds a whole new requirement on receiving
leave.
QUESTION:

If the requirement was so difficult

12

to deal with, one would expect there would have been some

13

comment to that effect.

14

rulemaking, and as I understand it there was no comment by

15

employers about the requirement that notice be given that

16

the leave is counting as family leave.

17

MR. BENNETT:

This is with notice and comment

I believe there was a notice on

18

these regulations when they came out initially, and then

19

they issued final regulations, and I can't speak directly

20

as to the comments that were -- all the comments that were

21

made about this one particular regulation, but I believe

22

the DOL in their brief does mention that there was not a

23

objection --

Yes.

to that, and I believe that to be accurate, Your Honor,

2

but I don't believe -- and I can attest for my client's

3

purpose that we did recognize from reading that that what

4

we were going to have to do was grant additional leave,

5

additional leave, that we're not going to be able to grant

6

additional leave, that we're going to have to grant

7

additional leave over and above what we've given them.

8

We've given 30 weeks already for --

9

QUESTION:

But why wouldn't they recognize that,

10

because that's what the regulation said.

11

wasn't trying to disguise that that would be --

12

MR. BENNETT:

The regulation

No, Justice Ginsburg, it was not.

13

I just do not believe that employers fully understood that

14

that was the penalty provision under this particular

15

regulation.

17

to provide the specific prospective notice to employees.

It's now become very obvious that that's

The statute says, employer, if you get -- if an

employee lets you know that they have -- they need leave

or adoption.

protected, you must make sure that you continue their

That's what Congress said all you have to do, employer, in

granting the leave.

You can give them leave for all of those purposes, 30

12

that's clearly inconsistent with Congress' stated purpose

17

MR. BENNETT:

18

Your Honor, we have taken the

position that the statute --

20

QUESTION:

21

were suggesting a moment ago.

22

suggest?

No, but I thought that's what you

23

MR. BENNETT:

24

QUESTION:

25

Now,

Is that what you meant to

The notice --

The Secretary cannot even require a

notice?

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BENNETT:

Correct, Your Honor.

I think the

2

statute has spoken to that.

They talk about notice.

That

3

statute provides that the employee is to notify the

4

employer of the need for leave.

5

once the employer receives the notice, the employer is to

6

provide the notice.

7

regard to employee, and did not use the term notify in

8

regard to the employer in that particular case, so you

9

can't argue that Congress didn't consider notice.

The statute goes on that

Congress used the term, notify, in

They

10

clearly considered notice, and because they used notice in

11

one particular portion of the statute and left it out in

12

another particular portion of the statute, there's a

13

presumption, Your Honor, that Congress did that

14

purposefully and intentionally.

15

QUESTION:

What if the employer's leave does not

16

comply with all of the conditions, all right, that are

17

required by the act, and the employee goes off on that

18

leave, and there's no notification that the employee could

19

get more, could have the benefits continued or what-not.

20

What happens in that situation?

21

It doesn't count as statutory leave, does it?

22

MR. BENNETT:

Does that leave count?

If the employee was given the

23

leave, Your Honor, I believe that the leave counts.

Then

24

the issue becomes whether you've interfered with their

25

rights under the statute.

Did you -- for instance, if you

That was the

Your Honor, the regulations

23

promulgated by the Department of Labor provide that if an

24

employer -- excuse me.

25

If a physician certifies that an

2

to be absent for 60 days, or 90 days, the employer can't

3

require during that initial certification that they

4

recertify unless they have some other reasons to think

5

they need to.

6

But in this case, the doctor's certification

7

that was provided to the employer was 30 days, and the

8

statute says where the doctor doesn't provide for a longer

9

certification, an employer can require that an employee on

10

a -- provide certification on a reasonable basis no sooner

11

than every 30 days, which --

12

QUESTION:

Well, wasn't the 30-day period chosen

13

in this case because the employer's regulation says we'll

14

only do it for 30 days at a time?

That is true, Your Honor.

16

is -- that was the company's policy to require the

17

certification every 30 days.

The legislative history again surrounding this

QUESTION:

So you're saying it's a false

question as to whether, when the employee takes leave,

3

he's taking FMLA leave or employer's leave, that there

4

aren't two categories?

5

MR. BENNETT:

7

No, sir, that's correct,

Justice -QUESTION:

So that you don't have to give the

8

notice in order that the employee can know which of the

9

two leaves he's taking.

He just takes leave, and if the

10

employer doesn't give him all of the benefits that the

11

FMLA requires on that leave, then there's a damages

12

provision in the act.

13

MR. BENNETT:

That's correct, Your Honor, there

14

is no requirement in the statute that the employee notify

15

the employer that they're taking leave.

16

notification -- the only -- the provision that DOL is

17

bootstrapping their argument to, or their regulation to,

18

is 2612(b)(2), which says if you're going to do paid

19

leave, if you're going to provide the employee with paid

20

leave, which is not the case here, this was unpaid leave,

21

if you're going to provide the employee with paid leave --

22

which is not the case here.

23

The only

This was unpaid leave.

If you're going to provide the employee with

24

paid leave, Congress said, then you've got -- you can

leave, or the employee can use it if they don't have

2

the -- if they need to take paid leave as opposed to

3

unpaid, they can use that, but at that point the employer

4

provides the leave.

5

said, if it's unpaid leave, you have to designate or

substitute it for company-provided leave.

7

explicit is that unpaid leave, as long as it meets these

8

conditions, is FMLA leave.

QUESTION:

There's no provision that Congress

Clearly

Well, there's no provision, but

10

neither is there any clear answer to the question, and I

suppose one of the arguments in favor of the Secretary's

regulation here is that it really was a gap-filling

regulation with respect to unpaid company leave.

require the employee to use paid leave and it's less than

3

the 12 weeks, then the additional amount between the paid

requiring.

reasonable for the Secretary to come up with a rule that

2

tells us whether it counts against the act or whether it

5

MR. BENNETT:

Their assumption is that there's a

gap and that it's reasonable for them to step in.

6

QUESTION:

That's right.

7

MR. BENNETT:

Our position, Your Honor, is that

8

Congress specifically decided not to require that.

They

talk about in the statute a total of 12 weeks of leave.

10

The statute doesn't say a total of company -- or paid

11

leave or unpaid.
QUESTION:

12

Well, Congress may not have required

13

it, but at the end of the 12 weeks there's still the

14

question, did this count under the statute, or didn't it

count under the statute, and if the statute was silent, it

would seem to be that that would be a subject for the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LUTHER O. SUTTER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. SUTTER:

The company never gave the doctor

the option to allow Ms. Ragsdale to work intermittently.

On the joint appendix at page 63 and 64 the company form

6

only asks whether the worker needs sick leave.

ask, like the certification required by the Department of

8

9

and the form does not allow the doctor to certify more

It doesn't

than 30 days.
In fact, the actual policy at issue in this

refused to give them.

The question then becomes, then, how is Ms.

Ragsdale, or did the Secretary act reasonably when it

required the company to tell Ms. Ragsdale about her rights

to intermittent leave, her rights to extended leave more

8

than 30 days, her right to be reviewed by a doctor that

Well, of course, you couldn't really

do it on the front end here because she wasn't eligible

originally for FMLA leave.

MR. SUTTER:

It had already happened.

Well, that's true, Justice

22

O'Connor, but the regulatory scheme provides that the

employer should have given her a date by which she would

QUESTION:

But it is somewhat unusual that a

10

union wouldn't advise the employees, its membership about

their statutory rights.

MR. SUTTER:

Of course it is, and it might be

13

entirely reasonable for me to stand up here and substitute

my judgment for the Secretary's, but it is also equally

15

reasonable that the company be allowed the benefit of

16

making this determination, and to say that the requirement

17

that employees communicate is infirmed, we disagree,

18

because you see, 2612 -- 2611 requires communication for

planning when intermittent leave is required.

MR. SUTTER:

-- information is the key to

exercising these rights, and if you don't know that you
