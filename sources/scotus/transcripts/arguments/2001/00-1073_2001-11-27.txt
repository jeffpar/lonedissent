ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERRY A. RICHARDSON

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

12

MR. RICHARDSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue presented by this case is whether

13

Congress, in enacting the Family Educational Rights and

14

Privacy Act, intended to prohibit the common and

15

longstanding practice of peer grading of routine homework

16

papers, quizzes, and tests.

17

to apply to such routine classroom activities, because

18

Congress was concerned only with information that might

19

have a long-term negative impact on a student's academic

20

or career opportunities.

Congress did not intend FERPA

21

QUESTION:

Mr. --

22

QUESTION:

Did you take the position in the

23
24
25

court of appeals that there is no private contract?
MR. RICHARDSON:

We did not raise that issue in

the court of appeals, Your Honor.

No, we did not.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

The court of appeals discussed it.

2

MR. RICHARDSON:

The court of appeals raised it

3

sua sponte, and it has been raised in amicus briefs

4

submitted -- in fact, three amici have discussed it.

5
6
7

QUESTION:

Why didn't you raise the issue?

Why

isn't that more important than what you did raise?
MR. RICHARDSON:

Candidly, Your Honor, we didn't

8

raise it for a number of reasons.

9

the district court there was a Fourteenth Amendment claim

10
11

Number 1, because in

which clearly was actionable under section 1983.
Number 2, quite honestly we believe the merits

12

argument regarding FERPA was stronger than the section

13

1983 argument.

14

Remember --

QUESTION:

Well, I just don't know if it's a

15

good practice for you to force us to reach an issue you

16

think is important if there's no cause of action anyway.

17

That just doesn't seem to me an orderly way to proceed.

18

MR. RICHARDSON:

Well, in hindsight I would

19

agree with the Court that we should have approached it a

20

different way.

21

this case was filed, at the time the court of -- at the

22

time the district court entered its decision, and at the

23

time the briefs were submitted in the Tenth Circuit, the

24

Christiansen decision had not come down.

25

the benefit -- we were under the impression, I should say,

Please recall, however, that at the time

We did not have

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that we -- that the family policy compliance officer's

2

letter would be accorded Chevron deference, as the

3

district court did.

4

We did not know that the Court was going to

5

decide Christiansen and hold that such opinion letters

6

were not entitled to such deference.

7

decision to focus on the merits rather than focus --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. RICHARDSON:

10

QUESTION:

We made a tactical

Well --- on the 1983 aspect of it.

-- you also certainly had some

11

justification on the private cause of action.

12

number of decisions from this Court which have come out 5

13

to 4 one way and then 5 to 4 the other way --

14

MR. RICHARDSON:

16

to prevail on that.

17

Seeing a

That's very true, Your Honor.

-- you're not sure that you're going

MR. RICHARDSON:

That's very true, Your Honor.

18

Both the decisions of this Court, with all due respect,

19

are sometimes difficult for a practicing attorney to

20

discern a clear line of --

21

QUESTION:

They're hard for us, too.

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. RICHARDSON:

And the other factor I would

24

say is that the two decisions that the Tenth Circuit cited

25

from other courts of appeals, the only two decisions that

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

we were aware of from the Second Circuit, the Fay v. South

2

Colonie School District decision, and from the Fifth

3

Circuit, Tarka v. Cunningham, both of those courts of

4

appeals had held that FERPA was actionable under 1983, so

5

again, we made a strategic decision --

6

QUESTION:

Well, what if we think there's a real

7

problem with that notion under this scheme, where the

8

whole object was to have it administratively determined

9

and it was funding mechanism, and under the act, the

10

penalty for not following it is a cut-off of funding.

11

Now, what if we're quite concerned about that.

12

MR. RICHARDSON:

13

QUESTION:

Oh, I --

Do we send it back and let it be

14

briefed and argued below?

15

MR. RICHARDSON:

No, I don't believe so, Your

Honor.

We would be the only one that would

21

suffer any prejudice.

We have endorsed the position

argued by the amici in the three briefs that have raised

23

the issue.

24
25

The Tenth Circuit did rule on it, and we not only

Respondent herself did address it in her

The only party that really hasn't briefed the

I believe it's perfectly appropriate for the
Court to decide that, and I believe that the Court -- that

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Court's decisions do indicate that FERPA is not

2

actionable under 1983.

3

look at the language of the statute, of course, which is

4

the ultimate issue, there is no rights creating language

5

in FERPA the way there is, for instance, in title 9, that

6

the Court focused on in Canon.

7

If you focus on the -- go back and

Also, this is a Spending Clause case.

There is

8

no -- the Spending Clause, as the Court has indicated

9

repeatedly, is in the nature of a contract and there is no

10
11
12
13

unambiguous indication here that Congress -QUESTION:

You didn't raise this in your

petition for certiorari, though, did you?
MR. RICHARDSON:

We didn't raise it -- no, Your

14

Honor, we didn't.

15

certiorari because we had not raised it in the court below

16

and, frankly, we believed that the odds of persuading the

17

Court to grant certiorari on an issue that we had not

18

raised and briefed below were not very good and, again,

19

our focus had always been on the merits of the case, and I

20

believe we should win on the merits, but I also believe

21

that section 1983 is not -- does not provide a cause of

22

action under FERPA.

23

We didn't raise it in the petition for

FERPA says -- it uses the language, no funds

24

shall be available to an educational agency or institution

25

that has a policy or practice of allowing the disclosure

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of education records.

2

systematic practice on the part of an educational agency

3

or institution.

4

That is clearly talking about a

If a section 1983 remedy were allowed, then what

5

about an individual teacher who, in violation of the

6

district's own policy or practice -- the district, say,

7

has a policy that we will not release it, yet an

8

individual teacher makes a deliberate choice to release

9

the information.

Under 1983 that teacher would have to be

10

held liable, it would seem to me, even though the district

11

had done exactly what Congress commanded.

12

had enacted a policy saying, don't do that, so that

13

clearly militates against a 1983 cause of action.

14

In addition, FERPA --

15

QUESTION:

The district

Do you know anything about how this

16

act is enforced on the Federal side?

Have there been any

17

fund terminations, because the only thing in the statute

18

itself is fund termination, isn't that right?

19

MR. RICHARDSON:

That is correct, Your Honor,

20

and I'm not aware of any decisions.

21

nothing in the record to indicate that there's ever been a

22

funding -- well, I may have overspoken.

23

from the record.

24

of those extensive letters from the FPCO, but I do not

25

recall, and do not -- cannot represent to the Court that

There is certainly

I do not recall

There might be something in the lodging

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there's anything in the record regarding there ever having

2

been a funding cut-off.
QUESTION:

3
4

Well, I guess we are taking you away

from the question on which we granted certiorari.

5

As I understand the position of the respondent

6

here, and tell me if I'm incorrect, if the respondent is

7

correct, the teacher would have to keep a record of all of

8

these quizzes as part of the permanent record, is that the

9

necessary result of the respondent's argument?
MR. RICHARDSON:

10

The respondent seems to take

11

the position, which is contrary to what the Tenth Circuit

12

said -- the respondent seems to take the position that

13

only records, only grades or scores that are recorded in

14

the teacher's grade book are education records.

15

Circuit clearly said that's not the case.

The Tenth

The Tenth Circuit clearly said, even if the

16
17

grade is never recorded in a teacher's grade book, the

18

mere fact that the teacher receives it and uses it for

19

some purpose, maybe even just to evaluate her own teaching

20

performance, and determine whether the class is ready to

21

move on to the next lesson, that makes it an education

22

record.

23

Respondents have backed away from that.

They

24

argue in their brief at least, or she argues in her brief

25

at least that it has to be recorded in the teacher's grade

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

book, but we believe that even that is a far more broad

2

definition of education records than what Congress plainly

3

says in the statute.

4

records with a two-part definition.

5

files, documents, or other materials that contain

6

personally identifiable information and are maintained by

7

an educational agency or institution, or by a person

8

acting for an educational agency or institution.

The statute defines education
It's those records,

Now, maintained has to have some substantive

9
10

meaning, because it's half of the definition.

Clearly,

11

homework papers are personally identifiable.

There's no

12

doubt about that.

13

more than what the Tenth Circuit said it meant, simply

14

possessed by a teacher for some brief period of time, then

15

that's really writing that word out of the definition.

16

Any document that comes across a teacher's desk would be

17

an education record.

But if maintained doesn't mean anything

In fact, chalkboard work would have to be an

18
19

education record.

If a teacher asks a student to come to

20

the chalkboard, do a math problem, that's personally

21

identifiable information.

himself.

What's your definition of maintain,

what, a week, a month?

MR. RICHARDSON:

QUESTION:

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. RICHARDSON:

I don't think that --

Make me an offer.

What's your --

Your Honor, I think that what

7

Congress is getting at with the word maintained, it goes

8

back to what I said in the opening statement, which is,

9

information that could have a long-term effect on the

10

student's career.

11

and the legislative history bears this out.

12

Honor is not particularly persuaded by that -QUESTION:

13
14

I think Congress was talking about -I know Your

Some of my colleagues like that

stuff.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. RICHARDSON:

-- by that argument, but

17

Congress was concerned about things that would have a

18

long-term effect.

19

What I would suggest the Court focus on, is this

20

the kind of document that's going to be looked at by a

21

college admissions officer?

22

that's going to be looked at by a potential employer, or a

23

governmental agency at some point down the road?

24
25

QUESTION:

Is this the kind of document

Is there a difference between your

position and -- the Government said, it means, educational

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

MR. RICHARDSON:

QUESTION:

4

No.

The kind that would be in the

principal's office and not in the teacher's drawer.
MR. RICHARDSON:

5

No.

No, Your Honor.

Our

6

position and the Government's, with that regard I believe

7

the Government's current position, as reflected in the

8

brief of the United States, are consistent.

9

think -QUESTION:

10

I don't

It's not been the position that the

11

Government, that this FPCO has taken consistently, because

12

wasn't there -- didn't they say that the teacher's grade

13

book --

14

MR. RICHARDSON:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Yes.

-- did count as an educational

record?
MR. RICHARDSON:

Yes.

The FPCO had previously

18

taken a much broader interpretation of education records,

19

and had taken the position which essentially seems now to

20

be adopted by the respondent, that once the teacher

21

main -- once the teacher receives possession of the grade,

22

or the score, it becomes an education record.

23

States has disavowed that position and said that is

24

clearly more broad than what the -- but the key point --

25

QUESTION:

The United

But if your definition is correct,

13
Alderson Reporting Company

1

and it's that limited that it's only the stuff the school

2

keeps that will go on into the permanent record of the

3

student, what would be the reason for that exception that

5

teacher makes?

stuff never goes down to the central office, much less is

21

capital (B), then small (i), the term education records

22

does not include -- there's nothing in this definition

about grade books.

The reference to the grade books, and it's
really not a reference to grade books, it's a reference to

Alderson Reporting Company

1

record books, is from the legislative history, where the

2

Court -- where the Congress said, this exception was meant

3

to apply to things used as memory aids.

4

that a grade book is not something that is intended as a

5

memory aid.

6
7

QUESTION:

I would argue

But my point is, you wouldn't need

that exception.

8

MR. RICHARDSON:

9

QUESTION:

Well --

If -- that -- I mean, that exception

10

suggests that other things that are only -- only held in

11

the sole possession of the maker --

12

MR. RICHARDSON:

13
14
15
16

I disagree that you would not

need that.
QUESTION:

-- could be within the statute.

Why

would you need that exception?
MR. RICHARDSON:

Well, for instance, a

document -- a counseling record, for instance, perhaps the

student had experienced some emotional problems, or

19

institution records, or doesn't show it to another person,

3

that's a sole possession notes exception, and would not --

4

QUESTION:

And you think that's the kind of

5

thing that would come within your definition of permanent

6

records, the kind of things that go on to college

7

admissions offices, and so forth?

8

you were saying.

10

MR. RICHARDSON:
QUESTION:

That's what I thought

Well, I think that's --

But now you're saying, even the

11

notes, personal notes kept by a counselor come -- would

12

come within this statute but for that exception, right?

13

MR. RICHARDSON:

Well, but for that exception.

14

I think that's why the exception is there, is to keep

15

materials like that from coming into the possession --

16

QUESTION:

Exactly.

17

MR. RICHARDSON:

-- because materials like that

18

are maintained by an educational agency or institution.

19

They are a -- counselors that have a record of a student

20

with emotional problems --

21

QUESTION:

So are a teacher's grade books.

Why

22

in that respect is a teacher's grade book different from

23

the counselor's notes?

24
25

MR. RICHARDSON:

I believe because a grade book

is, in my opinion, Your Honor, more of an evaluation

instrument rather than a record.

A transcript shows what

2

the student earned in a grade, or in a group of grades

3

during the course of his academic career.

4

more than simply a dry record of the percentages that a

5

student achieved during his time in his class.

6

instance, during a relevant grading period a student might

start out doing very average C work.

might near the end of the grading period suddenly get it,

and start doing B and A work.

A grade book is

The student then

10

The teacher would, I think any teacher in

America would look at a grade book containing those

records and would not simply go, okay, the total average

for this grading period is a 78.5, he or she gets a C.

the teacher would look at the improvement shown in the

And the counselor's notes aren't?

MR. RICHARDSON:

Well, that argument might very

well apply to counselor's notes as well.
QUESTION:

I mean, that's the problem.

Your

24

notion of what are records maintained just does not square

25

with the existence of that exception.

1

Congress does more harm than good by putting in an

2

exception, because the exception suggests that if it had

3

not been there, the stuff would have been covered.

4

Congress didn't want this stuff to be covered, but -MR. RICHARDSON:

5

Maybe

Well, I think that's an

6

alternative possibility, Your Honor, is that it's a belt

7

and suspenders approach that Congress never intended grade

8

books to be covered, but just in case somebody happened to

9

be inclined to read them that way, we're going to put this

10

exception in as well.
QUESTION:

11

We usually don't interpret statutes

that way.

MR. RICHARDSON:

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

And it would be consistent with that

18

argument that you say, well, a teacher's grade book is

19

kept for the year, but it doesn't become normally part of

20

the institutional records of the school, so it's not

21

maintained for a substantial enough period of time to

22

qualify, whereas -- and I just don't know factually about

23

this -- maybe the guidance counselor's records are simply

24

kept forever.

25

durational criterion something you want to stand on here?

I don't know.

I mean, is that kind of a

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. RICHARDSON:

Not in a -- no, not a pure

2

durational criteria.

3

Again, many grade books are not -- I don't think Congress

4

meant to draw a line and say, okay, you keep it 6 months,

5

it's maintained, if you keep it 5 months and 3 weeks and 6

6

days it's not maintained.

7

to do that, and I'm not asking the Court to do that.

8
9
10
11

I don't think that is the key.

I don't think Congress intended

I think Congress again intended to get at
records that are, as a practical matter, maintained over a
long period of time that are institutional records.
QUESTION:

But what is the definition of

12

maintain, then, that you're using?

13

MR. RICHARDSON:

The definition of maintain that

14

I would ask the Court to adopt is its common meaning, to

15

preserve, to retain.

16

QUESTION:

Yes, but don't -- doesn't that force

17

us into some kind of a durational -- and I'm not saying

18

this is an objection to your argument, particularly, but I

19

mean, doesn't this force us into some kind of a durational

20

criterion?

21

corrects the student B and calls out to the teacher, the

22

number that student B puts on top of the quiz is a record

23

for a short period of time.

The record of the quiz which student A

24

MR. RICHARDSON:

25

QUESTION:

But it's not the kind --

I mean, something is recorded, and

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you're saying, well, sure, they can't be getting at that,

2

but if they're not getting at that, then it's either got

3

to be for one of two reasons, either the kid who does the

4

correction isn't a person who maintains, who makes a

5

record by definition --

6

MR. RICHARDSON:

7

QUESTION:

Correct.

-- or a record is something that has

8

got to be maintained longer than the period that it takes

9

for some kid to call a number out to the teacher, which is

10
11

a durational criteria.
MR. RICHARDSON:

That's true, and that's the

12

same reason that a chalkboard, work on a chalkboard would

13

not be maintained in the meaning of FERPA, even though it

14

might be up there not only for a minute or two -- I mean,

15

in some college --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. RICHARDSON:

18
19

May I ask you --- courses you may have

chalkboard work that's up there for a week or more.
QUESTION:

-- do you concede, or do you not,

20

that the announcement by one student of another student's

21

grades within the classroom and not outside the classroom

22

is a release of information within (B)(i)?

23

MR. RICHARDSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. RICHARDSON:

No, absolutely not.

Because?
Because it's not an education

Alderson Reporting Company

1

record.

You can only have -QUESTION:

2

Assuming it was an educational

3

record, would you say that it's a release when it's

4

revealed by one student to another within the classroom?
MR. RICHARDSON:

5

No, I don't believe -- in the

6

context of pure grading, it would make no sense to say

7

that one student, that it's not a release if the student

8

grading the paper records the grade.

9

context, the Tenth Circuit's analysis would be right.

I mean, in that

If it is an education record, then the fact that

10
11

one student sees it is just as damming as the fact that

12

the entire class sees it, it seems to me, but it's not an

13

education record, therefore there's no question of

14

release.

15
16
17

The other point I would make, going back to the
grade book -QUESTION:

I'm slightly worried about that,

18

because suppose that -- I take it attendance records are

19

also -- they probably are maintained, and they are

20

records, aren't they?

21

MR. RICHARDSON:

Attendance -- well, again I

22

would say that attendance records are not the kind of

23

information --

24

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Richardson.

Mr. Kneedler, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

3
4
5
6

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act

7

does not prohibit the common classroom practice of one

8

student grading another student's paper, or other common

9

classroom and teaching practices.

FERPA regulates the

10

records maintained by an institution, not the homework and

11

classwork of students.

12

to intrude into the day-to-day activities of hundreds of

13

thousands of classrooms across the Nation, or the way in

14

which teachers conduct the educational process in those

15

classrooms, or the way in which students interact with

16

each other.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Congress did not intend for FERPA

Does the act cover a teacher's grade

book that she keeps during the term?
MR. KNEEDLER:

It addresses the grade book, in

20

our view, by including it -- we think ordinarily it would

21

come within the sole possession exception in the act.

22

Now, I think it's important to recognize that

23

even a grade book -- there may be no one uniform practice

24

about the way a grade book is handled.

25

particular school would regard the grade book as an

It could be that a

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

official school record from the outset, where the

2

principal always has access to it, and the teacher is

3

really maintaining a record on behalf of the institution

4

in keeping the grade book.

5

You could have other school systems in which the

6

grade book is essentially used by and for the future as a

7

memory jog, and all that she ever discloses to the front

8

office is the semester grade.

9

that the grade book would fall within the sole possession

10

exception, so that this is one of the things about FERPA,

11

is that it addresses the situation in which actual record-

12

keeping practices may vary, or let me change that, actual

13

pedagogical practices may vary widely from school district

14

to school district, and that's why we think importantly

15

this act did not enter the classroom by addressing the way

16

teachers handle papers, give feedback to students, have

17

students grade each other's --

18

QUESTION:

In that event, we think

What about posting the results of the

19

exam, the big exam, mid-term exam, and the student posts

20

the results on the board.

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think under the position we've

22

espoused here, that would not be a violation of the act.

23

FPCO has taken the position in the past that it would be.

24

I think it would depend, though, or may depend on the way

25

in which the grades were assembled.

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

I think if the teacher or professor, let's say,

2

in college, the only grades probably ever, ever assembled

3

or marked down for a college course may be the final exam

4

grade.

5

which the professor marks down the grade for everyone in

6

that class and sends it to the registrar, and from that

7

list puts a list of final grades for the course.

8

at that point, the fact that the grades would be derived

9

from something that would be regarded as an institutional

The professor may have a grade sheet, a roster in

I think

10

record, in that instance I think the posting of the grades

11

may well be a violation.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

But if he posts it before he sends it

on to the administration office -MR. KNEEDLER:

If it's posted -- and this may

15

sound technical, but this is where the two categories we

16

think intersect.

17

he takes the grade book and puts A or B or C on the paper,

18

we don't think that the student work itself is an

19

institutional record, and it's not --

20

If a grade is divulged from the paper,

QUESTION:

But you're also, I think, saying that

21

the disclosure has got to be of the record, not merely of

22

information that may ultimately end up in a record?

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's exactly true, and there

24

are analogous situations in which that's true, for

25

instance the attorney-client privilege, that the attorney

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

can't disclose something that he's learned from the

2

client, but that doesn't mean that the same information in

3

the possession of the client is privileged.

4

QUESTION:

How is this -- the more I hear, I --

5

there used to be schools in any case that would say, the

6

following 10 percent of the class graduates with honors,

7

the next 40 percent, okay, and sort of honors, and the

8

last 60 percent, well, they graduated, didn't they.

9

mean, they didn't put it quite like that, but it was all

10

I

public, in the newspaper.

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

Now, is that all forbidden now?
No.

Quite aside from the issue

14

in this case, this statute contains an exception for

15

what's called directory information, which includes common

16

information about a student, the fact of their attendance,

17

et cetera, and that includes honors awarded to a student.

18

That information can be released.

19

higher education institution has to announce a policy.

20

QUESTION:

The school district or

What are we dealing with here?

You

21

don't have much time, and I am concerned.

22

do you think, just with the student grading and the

23

knowledge obtained thereby, or are we dealing with the

24

teacher's grade book, or both?

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Are we dealing,

All that is strictly presented in

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

this case is the practice of one student grading another's

paper before the teacher has gotten the papers themselves

or entered them in the grade book.

MR. KNEEDLER:

There's no educational record

And as to that, what is your succinct

Because it isn't maintained, or

because it isn't a record?
MR. KNEEDLER:

10

Well, whether it's maintained is

11

part of the definition of educational record.

12

educational record is a record or document containing

13

information directly related to the student that is

14

maintained by the school and, in our view, maintained in

15

that situation means maintained as an institutional

16

record, and we think that the act generally draws a

17

distinction between the institutional records and the

18

classroom records of the teacher, and I -QUESTION:

19

Mr. Kneedler, do you have a position

on the threshold question?

MR. KNEEDLER:

We do not have a position on

therefore we did not address it in our brief, and under

this Court's Air Couriers decision, the existence of a

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

cause of action is not jurisdictional and may be assumed.
We -- I would point out, though, that the

2
3

ability of the Department of Education to cut off funds is

4

not the sort of factor that has in other situations been

5

thought to be sufficient to preclude a 1983 cause of

6

action.

7

Court has said that that is a different sort of remedy and

8

does not preclude a private right of action.

In Blessing v. Freestone and other cases, this

of that exception that we were talking about earlier --

QUESTION:

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

Why, by reason

Two different questions.

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

2

QUESTION:

3
4

That's correct.

Which means it would have been

embraced by the statute, but for that.
MR. KNEEDLER:

That's probably true, but it's --

5

one thing to bear in mind here is, this act was passed in

6

one form early in 1974.

7

identified, and it was amended and revised and elaborated

8

upon later in 1974, and there is a description by Senators

9

Pell and Buckley describing the original version of the

10

act, in which they indicated that personal records were

11

not the sort of thing that was intended to be included,

12

because the act then used the definition of official

13

records that were intended to be for school use, and they

14

said that these informal notes, and I think teacher notes

15

would be include din that, were not intended to be

16

included in the act to begin with.

17

Some difficulties were

So I think that there is a way in which that

18

gives emphasis to something that may well have been

19

excluded anyway, but they do fall within the coverage of

20

the act, because the act was revised to meet some concerns

21

that had been raised by local school districts.

22

I did want to point out two things in response

23

to Justice Kennedy's question.

This act does not require

24

a school district to retain any records.

25

records at any time.

It may destroy

It only addresses rights of parents

1

6

while the records are actually retained.
The other point is, we don't think that there is
anything talismanic about the duration -QUESTION:

But they don't have to be retained

for 45 days or anything?
MR. KNEEDLER:

If a request is made for them

7

they have to be retained until the request is resolved, a

8

request to inspect them, but if the parent or student,

9

adult student has not requested it, nothing in this act

10
11

requires the school district to keep them.
We don't think that duration is dispositive.

We

12

think because the act was designed -- we point this out at

13

pages 20 and 21 of our brief, and page 23 of our brief --

14

was intended to reach records that the school was going to

15

be -- use to make decisions about the student in an

16

institutional way, institutional decisions about the

17

student, which we think are different from what goes on in

18

the classroom in the day-to-day learning experience, and

19

so we think that that could include records, or some

20

materials that are kept by a principal that wouldn't

21

necessarily go into the permanent record, but would be

22

part of the school's overall supervision of the student

23

for that school year, so we do not think that the duration

24

of the period is dispositive.

25

Having said that, what gave rise to this act was

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

concerns about the sorts of things that were in the

2

permanent institutional records of the student, the sorts

3

of things that would follow the student, or that law

4

enforcement officers or probation officers or others would

5

have free access to when parents did not, and there was

6

concern that there might be irrelevant information, or

7

inaccurate or anecdotal information in records that would

8

make a real difference in the child's life, and that's

9

what this act is directed towards.

MR. WRIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act

18

was drafted by Senator Buckley, also known as the Buckley

19

Amendment.

20

Senator Buckley in 1974 stated that most

21

conscientious teachers would have no problem gaining the

22

consent of a parent, provided the teacher has demonstrated

23

the worth of his proposal.

24

Buckley did intend the Family Educational Rights and

25

Privacy Act to reach out into the record keeping process

that included the teacher's work or the -- or the records

that were being maintained by the teacher.
What the petitioners are requesting of this

disclose exam grades to whomever they choose.

6

only the cumulative or the permanent or the transcript

teacher writes it down in her grade book, you say it -- it

The only thing that's been disclosed is the

child does that?
MR. WRIGHT:

That is the record that has been

disclosed because the teacher is making the record.
QUESTION:

15

So you're saying the information

17

it doesn't become a record until the child says it, and

QUESTION:

It

It may well be illogical, but I don't

see anything in the statute that -- that prohibits it,

anymore -- you could say it's just as illogical to

prohibit the teacher from disclosing that information, but

if somebody else happens to know it, for that person to be

10

perfectly free to say, you know, Jack Smith's kid got a D

11

in that test.

12

course, it doesn't because the statute only covers certain

13

things, and what it covers is records.

MR. WRIGHT:

Does that violate the statute?

No, of

QUESTION:

Parents are bombarded with consent forms.

With respect to -You think that's what Senator Buckley

meant.
MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, with respect to education

records, that is correct, especially scores on exams.

11

We're dealing with a special ed student here that was

12

being mainstreamed in the classroom and having his grades

13

called out loud.

14

QUESTION:

As long as the teacher records them,

15

you say that.

16

the teacher could give a spot quiz and say, I'm not

17

counting it today, but everybody wants to know how

18

everybody performed, so we're going to have the grades

That's possibly true, but there are

Even the district court found --

QUESTION:

But what is the answer to that?

Is

called out, but doesn't record in her grade book.

25

MR. WRIGHT:

If she's not recording it in her

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

grade book, that is not a violation.
QUESTION:

2

And if she says, class, I want to

3

give you an incentive to do better, so I'm going to write

4

down these grades but I'm going to discount -- at the end

5

of the term I'm going to discount the lower two-thirds of

6

them.
MR. WRIGHT:

7

It's an education record.

The fact

8

that the teacher only uses three exam scores that she's

9

written in her grade book as opposed to five exam scores

10

does not nullify the parent's right to consent to the

11

release of that exam grade in the classroom.
QUESTION:

12

Is it perfectly clear that the

13

disclosure of information within the classroom setting is

14

a release of education records within the meaning of

(B)(i)?

MR. WRIGHT:

MR. WRIGHT:

19
20

Within the meaning of (B)(i) -Yes.

QUESTION:

Why do you say that if -- if it has

22

law enforcement and so forth?

In fact, FERPA is not a panacea for all performances.

In

it's not fine.

I'm reading off the answers in -- in the

QUESTION:

The students are making the

The teacher writes down -- the

15

teacher writes down in the book the comments that the

16

students made and she takes that into account in the final

17

grade in the course.

18

MR. WRIGHT:

Outside of the facts of this case,

19

that may be a violation if, in fact, she's making a record

20

and that was the intent of the teacher to make a record.

A -- a good alternate name for this

statute would have been the Anti -- the Prevention of

Mutiny Among Students Act?

district received $100 a year in Federal funds, and this

2

act were applied in the way you said, would that to you

3

raise any serious concerns of federalism?

4

MR. WRIGHT:

I think the funds need to be

5

available under an applicable program, and I think the

6

lower cases have -- have deemed that certain programs are

7

applicable and certain others are not.

8

through a State agency would be an applicable program.

Those facts were never raised in this particular case,

never defended by petitioners as to whether or not there

was any applicable Federal funding involved in this

12

particular case.

13

The solution to the problem with respect to this

14

issue that is before the Court, provide the parent the

15

right to consent -- in fact, that's what they're doing in

16

many schools or they're just, like the Tenth Circuit said,

do it anonymously or don't do it at all.

right, Mr. Wright.

5

no, they could cheat even during the exam because they

could write the answers on their hand.

They do cheat.

QUESTION:

Oh, yes, you're

No.

Well,

Well, you need two cheaters for that

to work, whereas if you grade your own paper, it only

takes one.

Right?

(Laughter.)

11

MR. WRIGHT:

We believe that the plain language

12

governs what is an educational record and it does not mean

13

the permanent transcript.

14

education records to mean a permanent transcript, they

15

could have easily placed language in there that said only

16

the permanent or cumulative record of a child is an

17

education record.

18

excepted out sole possession notes, which are notes of the

19

teachers.

14

MR. WRIGHT:

That never

No, that never happened.

But that

happened in a particular case that has been cited by the

petitioners in the State of California where a mom with a
