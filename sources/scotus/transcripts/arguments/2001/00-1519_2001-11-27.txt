ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. SCHLICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Since Terry, this Court has held repeatedly that

11
12

reasonable suspicion analysis requires a common sense

13

evaluation of the totality of the circumstances.

14

decision below is fundamentally inconsistent with that

15

rule because it requires law enforcement officers to

16

disregard potentially relevant facts when determining

17

whether investigative stop is warranted.

The

This Court's decisions in Cortez and Sokolow are

18
19

especially clear in rejecting attempts to put categories

20

of facts off limits.

21

vehicle's route, the timing of its trip, and its capacity

22

for carrying illegal aliens together established

23

reasonable suspicion, notwithstanding that each of those

24

facts independently might be consistent with innocent

25

travel.

In Cortez, the Court held that a

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

In Sokolow, the Court rejected a rule that would

2

have limited officers' ability to consider the personal

3

characteristics of suspected drug smugglers.

4

held that that sort of rule adds to the difficulty of

5

applying the reasonable suspicion standard.

6

ease it.

7

facts, facts consistent with innocent travel, in

8

themselves may together establish reasonable suspicion.

The Court

It does not

And the Court further confirmed that innocent

In this case, the Ninth Circuit attempted to

10

establish a rule that would bar categorically

11

consideration of certain facts that the court deemed

12

innocent.

13

problems.

14

That -- that rule presents two fundamental

The first is that it doesn't accommodate the

15

subtleties of real world encounters.

16

categorical rule, there would have to be exceptions and

17

subrules, and even if law enforcement officers could be

18

asked to master those, they would still then have to

19

anticipate new situations, and those rules could not

20

provide guidance when --

21

QUESTION:

For every

Mr. Schlick, you said this is an area

22

in which one can use one's common sense, and I thought

23

that what the Ninth Circuit was telling us was that some

24

items in that list under all circumstances wouldn't cast

25

suspicion.

And one was -- had a certain familiar ring

1

with me that when you see a police car, you slow down.

2

This wasn't a car that came to a screeching halt or was

3

trying to dodge it, and then it just slowed down.

4

isn't that a most natural reaction?
MR. SCHLICK:

5

And

The problem, Justice Ginsburg, was

6

that the Ninth Circuit didn't admit of situations in which

7

deceleration might be relevant.

8

Fifth Circuit's Villalobos case, which we cited in our

9

brief, the law enforcement officer pulled in front of the

For example, in the

vehicle that was suspected.

12

and the Border Patrol officer in that case deemed that

13

suspicious, that it appeared that the vehicle had changed

14

its speed in order to increase its distance from the

15

law -QUESTION:

16

The vehicle then slowed to

But they weren't talking about that

17

case.

They were talking about this case.

And I thought

18

what they were saying was that there was nothing

19

suspicious about the slowdown here, and if that's all that

20

you have, it won't do.

21

MR. SCHLICK:

Justice Ginsburg, we read the

22

court of appeals opinion as attempting to establish

23

categorical rules.

24

the court says, we attempt here to describe and clearly

25

delimit the extent to which certain factors may be

On page 12a of the petition appendix,

1

considered by law enforcement officers in making stops

2

such as the stop here.

3

after spotting a law enforcement vehicle is an entirely

4

normal response that is in no way indicative of criminal

5

activity.

6

possibility that deceleration may in some context be

7

suspicious.

8
9

On the same page, slowing down

That -- that appears not to have made a -- the

And indeed, in the Ninth Circuit's SigmondBallesteros case, decided after this case, the Ninth

10

Circuit interpreted its decision in this case as holding

11

that only certain factors may be considered by law

12

enforcement officers when making stops.

13

that categorical rule that is inconsistent with the

14

totality of the circumstances test.

15

QUESTION:

And it's -- it's

I suppose it would be suspicious if

16

-- if you're on a highway that has not only a maximum

17

speed but a minimum speed, and -- and the car slows down

18

20 miles below the minimum when it -- when it sees a

19

police officer.

20

reaction, would it?

That -- that wouldn't be a normal

21

MR. SCHLICK:

22

QUESTION:

No.

No, it would not.

And -- and do you think it's a normal

23

reaction always to slow down when one sees a police -- a

24

police car even if you happen to be going 10 miles below

25

the speed limit already?

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SCHLICK:

It may depend on the particular

2

area, and that's -- that may be a question on which you

3

would look to the law enforcement officer's experience and

4

expertise.
QUESTION:

5

I don't do it.

Maybe you do it.

But

6

if I'm 10 miles under the speed limit already, I -- I

7

don't immediately slow down when I see a police car.

8

don't know why you are willing to accept that as a -- as

9

an image of reality that everybody slows down when you see

10

a police car.

11

limit, I assume you do.

13

If you're -- if you're going over the speed

MR. SCHLICK:

12

I

I think your intuition accords

with common experience and the holdings of most courts.
QUESTION:

14

There was a concrete record here of

15

what this driver was doing, and he wasn't going 10 miles

16

an hour.

He was going a -- a normal speed.
MR. SCHLICK:

17

Justice Ginsburg, on page 57 of

18

the joint appendix, Agent Stoddard testified that the

19

extreme deceleration in this case, from about 50 to 55

20

miles per hour down to about 25 or 30 miles per hour, was

21

not normal and did set respondent's vehicle apart from

22

ordinary traffic on those roads.
QUESTION:

23
24
25

What was the speed limit on the

roads?
MR. SCHLICK:

Between 25 miles per hour and 35

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

miles per hour, Your Honor.

2

QUESTION:

And that's what he slowed down to.

3

QUESTION:

That was an established speed limit?

4

MR. SCHLICK:

Yes, Your Honor.

In -- in the

5

joint appendix, there are photographs which show speed

6

limit signs, and it's 35 miles per hour down near the

7

southern portion of the roads, 25 in the northern portion.
QUESTION:

8
9
10

where he slowed down?

I mean, it was 25 to 35?

was either 25 or 35.

What was it, do you know?

MR. SCHLICK:

11
12

No.

I -- I don't know for sure.

It

I --

I would guess it was 25, but I don't know for sure.
QUESTION:

13
14

What -- what was the portion where --

But that's what he slowed down to.

So, he had been going above the speed limit.
QUESTION:

15

That sounds a lot more reasonable

16

then.

I mean, gee, if you don't slow down to the speed

17

limit when you see a police car, you're in big trouble.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. SCHLICK:

Again, Agent Stoddard testified

20

that that sort of deceleration, that speed, was not common

21

in the area, and it --

22

QUESTION:

You mean they just keep zipping along

23

at 50 despite seeing a police car.

24

country is this anyway?

25

What part of the

1

QUESTION:

2

(Laughter.)

3

QUESTION:

4

It's Arizona.

What was the nature of the road?

Was

-- was it a regularly paved road?
MR. SCHLICK:

5

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

The road

6

on which respondent was apprehended was a dirt road.

It

7

was a road that Agent Stoddard testified is used primarily

8

by the local ranchers and by Forest Service vehicles and

9

by the Border Patrol itself.

It's -- it's not an improved

10

highway.

And it was extremely unusual, Agent Stoddard

11

believed, for a vehicle, a minivan, to be on these roads,

12

and it was a notorious smuggling route.
QUESTION:

13

Is this one on exhibit 5 of the joint

14

appendix, or have I got the wrong road there?

15

is Kuykendall Cutoff Road and Rucker Canyon Road.
MR. SCHLICK:

16

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

Exhibit 5

The -- the

17

photographs at the back of the joint appendix depict the

18

route.

19

the route up, as you get back to the later pages, toward

20

the northern portion.

21

intersection of Kuykendall Road and Rucker Canyon Road,

22

which is very close to where the apprehension occurred.

23

They -- they moved from the southerly portion of

Exhibit 24, for instance, is the

The maps in the joint appendix on pages 155 and

24

157 show the area at issue.

And you can see the first of

25

those maps on page 155 shows the route beginning at the

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

bottom of the page in the center, Leslie Canyon Road.

2

Respondent then -- and that's -- that's paved for about 10

3

miles, about the first 10 miles near Douglas.

4

Respondent traveled north on that road and then

5

at the T intersection you see approximately in the middle

6

of the page, by which point the -- the roads become

7

unpaved, headed right, away from the Border Patrol

8

checkpoint, away from the highway, which would take you

9

north, through the dirt road, proceeded up Rucker Canyon

10

Road, about three-quarters of the way up the page.

11

an important intersection.
QUESTION:

12
13

That's

Well, he turned left rather than

right, didn't he?
MR. SCHLICK:

14

I'm sorry.

Turned -- turned right

15

at the intersection, at that T intersection where Leslie

16

Canyon Road jogs right, then stayed on Leslie Canyon Road,

17

took a left on Rucker Canyon.

18

turn.

19

And that was a critical

Had he gone right, he would have been going

20

towards the only recreation areas in the vicinity.

And

21

that might have explained the presence of cargo in his --

22

in his minivan.

23

appeared to be cargo on the floor of the van.

24

instead turned left, away from the only -- the local

25

recreation area and on a route that, if he then took --

Agent Stoddard could see that there
But he

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

took a right onto Kuykendall Road, which is -- which is

2

again almost in the center of the page near the top

3

between numbers 2 and 3 -- if he took that right on

4

Kuykendall Road, then he would be circumventing the Border

5

Patrol checkpoint which is indicated by number 1 on the

6

left-hand margin of the page.

7

QUESTION:

The idea that he would eventually go

8

north on Kuykendall and then take -- go west to rejoin 191

9

north of the checkpoint.
MR. SCHLICK:

10

That -- that's right, and then

11

head up to I-10, which would allow him to go to Tucson --

12

Tucson or Phoenix, for example.

13

which Agent Stoddard testified is a notorious smuggling

14

route, very rarely used by anyone except ranchers and

15

Forest Service personnel -QUESTION:

16
17

Although it is a route that could

have been used by people going up to the Chiricahuas.
MR. SCHLICK:

18
19

And it was that route

It's -- it's possible, Your Honor,

but --

20

QUESTION:

From Douglas.

21

MR. SCHLICK:

-- the district court addressed

22

that possibility on page 22a of the petition appendix and

23

said that that would require a 40 or 50 mile trip over

24

unimproved dirt roads.

25

take I-191 straight up I-181 and then across to Chiricahua

The most logical way to go is to

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

National Monument.

2

That's particularly significant in this case

3

because the registration of the minivan was to a block

4

that was just two blocks from I-191 in Douglas, and that

5

makes it all the more inexplicable that a -- a vehicle

6

that should know the roads would go out of its way to

7

Leslie Canyon Road, rather than just going two blocks,

8

picking up the highway and heading straight north.

9

know, that's -- that's the route that you would take if it

10
11

You

were a long distance trip.
I said that the cargo couldn't be explained by

12

the recreation area, because it had already passed the

13

turn on Rucker Canyon Road.

14

a long distance trip because the highway is the road that

15

you would take if you were headed on -- on a long distance

16

with children with suitcases or overnight bags.

17

QUESTION:

Nor could it be explained by

Mr. Schlick, could I come back to the

18

-- to the slowing -- slowing up?

I'm not quite sure what

19

the -- what the Government's objection to the court's

20

opinion is.

21

true, in the circumstances of this case, that if somebody

22

is barreling along at 50, sees a police car, and slows

23

down to 25, that is not at all suspicious.

24

might consider it suspicious if he continued barreling

25

along at 50.

I -- I would tend to think that -- that it is

Indeed, I -- I

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

So, you know, if your argument is that in the

2

circumstances of this case, the slowing down was

3

suspicious, I -- I don't think I agree with you.

4

other hand, it is the case that the court of appeals

5

seemed to have -- seems to say that slowing down can never

6

be suspicious.

On the

Now, which of the two are -- are you objecting

7
8

to?

9

proper suspicion in this case simply because the person

10

Do you really think that -- I mean, that there was

slowed down to the speed limit when he saw the police car?
MR. SCHLICK:

11

In this case, Justice Scalia, the

12

deceleration is -- is not a factor on which the case would

13

turn.

14

I'd like to discuss in a moment.

15

There were other indications of nervousness which

QUESTION:

Okay.

So, as to that factor, your --

16

your -- really your only objection is you can't be as

17

categorical as the court of appeals put the point.

18

MR. SCHLICK:

That's -- that's exactly right.

19

We think it's a good example of the error of the court of

20

appeals' approach.

21

But in this case, even looking at the factor of

22

nervousness, there were other indications.

After

23

decelerating, respondent drove past the Border Patrol

24

vehicle and stared rigidly straight ahead, without looking

25

at or acknowledging Agent Stoddard, which --

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

May I ask this question?

At the very

2

page of the opinion that you call our attention to, the

3

court of appeals said, in reaching our conclusion, we find

4

that some of the factors on which the district court

5

relied are neither relevant nor appropriate to a

6

reasonable suspicious -- suspicion analysis in this case.

7

And are you agreeing with Justice Scalia that the slowing

8

down in this case was not relevant?

9

MR. SCHLICK:

10

it had some relevance.

11

particularly important factor, but it had some relevance.

12

The -- the court of appeals I think --

13
14

QUESTION:

Justice Stevens, we would say that
It was -- it was not a

Do you think the court of appeals

erred in saying that in this case it had no relevance?

15

MR. SCHLICK:

Yes, Justice Stevens.

16

QUESTION:

I see.

17

QUESTION:

And what about -- what about, you

18

know, not -- not waving to the police car as you go by?

19

don't know when I -- if I were ever exceeding the speed

20

limit and saw --

21

(Laughter.)

22

QUESTION:

I

-- and saw a police car, it seems to

23

me I would slow down and -- and try to give the impression

24

that I wasn't slowing down because I saw the police car.

25

(Laughter.)

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION:

I mean, you know, you don't hit the

brake and wave at the police officer.

3

(Laughter.)

4

QUESTION:

So, why is that a suspicious factor?

5

I don't see why in the circumstances of this case that's a

6

suspicious factor either.
MR. SCHLICK:

7

Agent Stoddard's testimony was

8

that both respondent and his front-seat adult passenger

9

stared straight ahead.

The respondent gripped the wheel

10

very tightly in -- in a position that Agent Stoddard

11

deemed characteristic of someone who simply wants to melt

12

into their vehicle if possible, and -QUESTION:

13
14

Or maybe somebody who had been going

50 miles an hour in a 25-mile-an-hour zone.
MR. SCHLICK:

15

Again, Agent Stoddard's testimony

16

was -- was that respondent's behavior was -- was very

17

unusual.

18

And after he saw those -- those and began to

19

follow the minivan, there was another indication of

20

nervousness, which was at the intersection of Rucker

21

Canyon Road and Kuykendall Road.

22

blinker, well ahead of the intersection, then turned it

23

off, drove towards the intersection, and just before the

24

intersection, made a sharp turn and turned on his blinker

25

again, which again indicated uncertainty or nervousness,

Respondent turned on his

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

which supported the inference that he was unusually

2

distracted by the presence of the Border Patrol vehicle.
QUESTION:

3

What's the testimony as to the amount

4

of use this particular route got?

5

anything about how many cars a day or an hour came over

6

it?
MR. SCHLICK:

7

How many cars a day,

The testimony, Mr. Chief Justice,

8

was that this road -- the sensor hits on -- the Border

9

Patrol maintains sensors along Leslie Canyon Road and

10

Rucker Canyon Road, and that the first sensor on Leslie

11

Canyon Road, which responded to northbound traffic, was

12

triggered about once every 2 hours.
QUESTION:

13
14
15

So, that would mean one car every 2

hours?
MR. SCHLICK:

Correct.

And -- and that's

16

directly relevant to the expected response.

When you're

17

in an area where one car travels approximately every 2

18

hours, you're more likely to acknowledge perhaps a

19

friendly wave -- another vehicle.

20

remote, and again, most of the traffic was local vehicles

21

from -- from the ranches, and the minivan was a vehicle

22

which was not only unusual by type for this road, because

23

it was not a four-wheel drive vehicle, but also had the

24

capability of carrying a large amount of concealed cargo,

25

which made it well-suited to smuggling activity.

This road was extremely

This

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Court noted in Brignoni-Ponce that that is a factor that

2

is potentially relevant when determining whether

3

investigative stop is warranted in the border context.

4

The -- the second problem with the court of

5

appeals approach, in addition to the fact that it can't

6

comprehend the subtleties the real world encounters, is

7

that it's unrealistic to ask officers to put out of their

8

minds facts that they see before them and believe to be

9

relevant.

Even if officers could do that, they would then

10

be left to speculate about the hypothetical import of the

11

imagined set of facts, and that's going to --

12

QUESTION:

One -- one of the things the Ninth

13

Circuit said is just looking at this laundry list and just

14

to throw everything in and mix it all up and say it's

15

suspicious that the driver didn't look at the police

16

officer or didn't wave, but it's equally suspicious that

17

the children did wave.

18

was damned if you do, damned if you don't.

19

that's no good, and if you don't wave, that's no good.

20

And I think that the -- the Ninth Circuit can't be faulted

21

for saying it's not good enough just to list everything

22

that happened and say it's -- everything the officer could

23

perceive and say it was all relevant.

24

QUESTION:

They were waving forward.
Correct.

And -- and the car -- the police --

the Border Patrol car was behind them.
MR. SCHLICK:

Correct.

It may be expected that

13

a Border Patrol agent would have some experience with

children's reaction to him in his vehicle.

It

went on for about 4 or 5 minutes.

The

17

children waved together, facing forward without -- without

18

facing Agent Stoddard.

19

And in this

It was methodical.

With respect to the damned if you do/damned if

20

you don't argument, waving or not waving, the court of

21

appeals ignored the fact that -- Agent Stoddard's

22

testimony was that he deemed it suspicious that when the

23

Border Patrol vehicle was stopped and respondent drove

24

past, respondent didn't acknowledge him at all.

25

that, he turned and began to follow respondent's vehicle,

having failed in his effort to avoid the -- the Border

that resulted, from Agent Stoddard's perspective, in a --

a very odd circumstance, and that's the exactly the sort

So, it's a reasonable inference that

judgment in these matters of a Border Patrol agent on the

scene?

16

MR. SCHLICK:

Ornelas, among other cases,

17

addressed that, Your Honor, and -- and held that it's

18

appropriate to give due weight to the expertise and

19

experience of law enforcement officers and local judges.

20

And in this case, both Agent Stoddard and -- and the trial

judge deemed this route to be unusual, to be associated

context of what was going on out there, and I believe

those are the trial judge's words.

this in the context of what was going on out there.
The cargo, for example.

He considered the

said that would be -- that would be a possible inference

5

were it not for all the other indications of illegality.

6

So, he -- he correctly undertook to analyze the facts -QUESTION:

7

May I ask this question?

I got the

8

impression, in reading the officer's testimony, what he

9

really did is once he checked and found where the car came

10

from, where it was registered in a high drug area, that's

11

what triggered his decision to stop the vehicle.

12

question to you is supposing all he knew was the very

13

unusual circumstances of a family driving in an area

14

that's mostly driven through by ranchers and -- and not

15

families.

Is the -- I'm just wondering if the rarity of the

10

that the officer did check and find that this vehicle was

11

registered in the -- in the area known for drug smuggling,

12

was that enough?

13
14

I think you said no.

MR. SCHLICK:

Is -- in your hypothetical,

Justice Stevens, is the fact that it was a minivan?

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

16

MR. SCHLICK:

Yes, yes.

If you knew that it was

17

a minivan, which was out of character, suited to carrying

18

aliens, and knew that the route had been taken, that last

19

turn onto Kuykendall Road, north so that the minivan would

20

not approach the checkpoint, then yes, there would be

21

reasonable suspicion.

22

QUESTION:

In other words, you're saying -- what

23

you're saying I think is that even if the Ninth Circuit

24

were correct in disregarding the waving and the slowing

25

down and the failure to wave once, you'd still have a

reasonable suspicion.
MR. SCHLICK:

2

Yes, Justice Stevens.

It would be

3

our position that even if you consider only the three

4

factors that the court of appeals considered categorically

5

in the analysis -- that would be the route, the fact that

6

it was a minivan, and the time.

7

Border Patrol was likely to have stepped down its

8

surveillance.

9

those factors, there was no reasonable suspicion.

The time was when the

The court of appeals held if you considered
We

10

would disagree and say even if you only consider those

11

factors, there was reasonable suspicion.

12

appropriate analysis is to consider all the factors

collectively, and then clearly there were grounds for the

stop.

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

explained in Martinez-Fuerte the -- the criteria the

2

Border Patrol uses to establish its fixed checkpoints, and

3

I think those criteria continue to hold true today.

4

of them is that the checkpoint should be outside, about 25

5

miles from the border, because 25 miles is the zone in

6

which a border crossing card allows an alien to travel.

7

So, you would -- so, you would be stopping aliens who were

about the sensors.

then a second sensor was triggered after respondent turned

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20
21

MS. BRAMBL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

22

I wanted to respond to the question that you

23

asked, Mr. Chief Justice, about who should we give due

24

weight to and who is going to know better, the officer in

25

the field, the district court, or the court of appeals.

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And certainly the decision in Ornelas v. United States

2

does instruct us that we give weight -- we review for

3

clear error the -- the factual findings that the district

4

court made.

5

the district court makes and -- and that the officer makes

6

are reviewed.

7

those.

8

as for clear error.

However, inferences from those findings that

They're reviewed giving due weight to

That is not as strict or rigorous as the standard

And then finally, Ornelas -- that decision

9
10

really wanted and instructed the courts -- the courts of

11

appeal to issue opinions that were instructive to firm up

12

the precedent and to offer guidance to everybody, to

13

officers in the field, to litigants, to district courts.

14

And really, the Ninth Circuit in this case -- they handle

15

the lion's share, over two-thirds of -- or approximately

16

two-thirds of the border stop cases come from the Ninth

17

Circuit.

18

said you just can't categorize these kind of factors and

say that this kind of thing is never useful and something

else is always useful.

MS. BRAMBL:

I think that all the parties agree

that the totality cannot have categorical rules because -QUESTION:

Well, then certainly you -- you must

7

-- you're not defending then some parts of the Ninth

8

Circuit opinion.

9

Is that correct?

MS. BRAMBL:

I think that some of the language

10

that the Ninth Circuit used was inartful in that it made

11

it sound -- if you take one sentence out of the whole

12

opinion, it would make it sound like they were creating

13

categorical rules.

14

whole opinion, in the context, they do cite all of the

15

cases this Court has decided:

16

Brignoni-Ponce, Wardlow.

17

everything.

18

But when you read everything, the

Sokolow, Terry, Cortez,

They say that they consider

But then they go through factor by factor.

And

19

I do defend the way they went about that, separating out

20

the factors and discussing them because it seems that that

21

would be the only orderly way to go about the analysis,

22

and the only way to -- to offer an opinion that really

23

does give some instruction and guidance.

24
25

QUESTION:

How -- how is that?

I was quite

disturbed actually by the opinion because I thought there

26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

were five or six Supreme Court cases that say this is just

2

the kind of opinion you should not write.

3

went through it, and it says, for example, one of the

4

factors, the fact the minivan slowed, is prohibited by our

5

precedent.

6

all depends.

7

to 10 in -- in 2 seconds, I'd say, why in the middle of

8

the desert did he feel compelled to slow so much?

9

suspect people don't give tickets in Arizona for driving

Well, my own common sense reaction would be it
If he was going 40 miles an hour and slowed

10

50 miles in the middle of the desert.

11

it doesn't say that.

12

So, then I -- I

I -- I

Maybe they do, but

I think it would depend.

He says that the fact that a van is registered

13

to an address in a block notorious for smuggling is of no

14

significance and may not be given any weight.

15

Then there are four or five others which are

16

listed where the second factor is of questionable value.

17

The failure -- he has five of them there, which say our

18

precedent says you give no weight.

19

Now, I just don't see how to square that either

20

with Ornelas, Sokolow, or five other precedents of this

21

Court, as well as with common sense, because it seems to

22

me it would all depend.

23

MS. BRAMBL:

Well, I certainly agree that --

24

that there may be circumstances in which where you live or

25

slowing down could be.

With respect to the first one,

Alderson Reporting Company

they go ahead and -- and then relate instances where

3

slowing down -- where they do find that this is

4

suspicious.

5

determined, using common sense and -- and I think a lot of

6

the comments this morning illustrate that if maybe not a

7

universal reaction, it's so common to slow down when you

8

see a law enforcement officer, that it's meaningless.

Just merely the act of slowing down they have

Maybe -- maybe we really don't know

10

enough to say that.

11

conversation with the Government's counsel.

12

point of fact, I'm not sure what the reaction is, as -- as

13

Justice Breyer puts it, out in the middle of the desert.

14

For one thing, I don't know whether -- whether

I -- I was engaging in that
But -- but in

15

Border Patrol officers can give speeding tickets.

16

another thing, I don't know whether it's generally known

17

that Border Patrol officers cannot give speeding tickets.

18

And therefore, I don't know whether it's, indeed, quite

19

common out in the middle of the -- of the vast desert of

20

Arizona for people to go barreling along at 50 miles an

21

hour past a Border Patrol agent and ordinarily to wave and

22

say hi.

23

(Laughter.)

24

QUESTION:

25

For

These are all matters that I'm sure

the Border Patrol agent was aware of, and perhaps the

2

appeals out in San Francisco was -- was aware of all of

3

those things.

4

agent and the district court the benefit of the doubt?

Why shouldn't I give the Border Patrol

MS. BRAMBL:

5

Well, the agent -- like so many of

6

the factors in this case, the agent didn't really tie down

7

or tie into his experience why slowing down would be

8

predictive or indicative of not just speeding but of

9

criminal activity such as alien or drug smuggling, which

10

was the reason that he was out there.
QUESTION:

11

Well, he said, people, when they see

12

my Border Patrol car, normally don't slow down.

13

certainly said that, and he found that to be unusual.

14

Now, why -- why should I think that that is false?

15

MS. BRAMBL:

QUESTION:

17

20
21

Do you know, as a matter of fact,

1

dangerous where maybe the public was in jeopardy, that

2

they would be authorized to make a stop, but just because

3

someone is speeding or violating an Arizona traffic law, I

4

don't believe that they would make such a stop.
But I wanted to point out that the Ninth Circuit

5
6

opinion went on, after they said that this factor was

7

squarely prohibited, to say the kinds of ways that slowing

8

down or a deceleration would be indicative of reasonable

9

suspicion or would -- would have some weight.

And they

10

characterized that as evasive driving where -- where

11

perhaps the Border Patrol is seen and then there's an act

12

of evasion as well as deceleration.
QUESTION:

13

Ms. Brambl, the -- the district court

14

ruled for the Government in this case, and the Ninth

15

Circuit reversed.

16

court's opinion, which the court of appeals was -- was

17

reviewing, that same laundry list that appears in the

18

Ninth Circuit's decision.

19

if you just take the district court's opinion, what did

20

the district court rely on that could be questionable?

21

The district judge did not rely on the children waving, as

22

I recall.

23

And I don't see that in the district

MS. BRAMBL:

So, what I don't understand is

Well, the district court judge did

24

refer to that, but what's -- what the -- the court of

25

appeals picked up on, which the district court didn't, was

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

all of the inferences that -- and subjective beliefs that

2

this waving entailed because it wasn't just -- the

3

children were facing forward and waving forward.

4

was a big leap that they were even waving at the agent to

5

begin with and an even bigger leap that the agent made

6

that they were coached to do so, presumably by the driver

7

or the adult passengers.

8

Circuit seized on.

So, it

And that's what the Ninth

9

And another big deficiency with this is how does

10

waving or waving in a mechanical, odd way, as the district

11

court found -- how would that be tied in to criminal

12

behavior?

And the record doesn't indicate how.
QUESTION:

13

How do we know from the record what

Now, I -- I mean, what's the response

MS. BRAMBL:

the heart of the issue presented by this case, which is

what can the court of appeals exclude as factors, even if

they do it on a case-by-case basis.

But it does seem as though the Ninth

14

Circuit was trying to suggest that no other court could

15

consider it in the calculus either in the future and --

16

and was making some kind of effort to develop some more

17

rigid guidelines than we've seen in the past.
Let me tell you what concerns me very frankly.

18
19

We live in a perhaps more dangerous age today than we did

20

when this event took place.

21

from totality of the circumstances in an era when it may

22

become very important to us to have that as the overall

23

test?

seemed to be a little more rigid than our precedents

require or that common sense would dictate today.

And are we going to back off

Ornelas recognized that certain fact patterns were

25

similar, such as Sokolow and Royer and a few others, that

1

really -- given how fact-specific they are, there really

2

is, especially when you start looking in border areas

3

where -- for instance, there are a number of stops where

4

there are checkpoints and -- and people claiming that

5

perhaps these people are on the road for checkpoint

6

evasion purposes.
QUESTION:

7

Yes, but -- but you know, checkpoints

8

vary too.

The checkpoint north of San Diego is -- is in a

9

heavily populated area where things may be quite different

10

than out here in the Sulphur Springs Valley where there

11

aren't very many people.
MS. BRAMBL:

12

Well, sure.

It seems that -- that

13

if you look through, for instance, just Ninth Circuit

14

opinions, or if you go over to Fifth Circuit and Tenth

15

Circuit, but also look at the -- the border areas, you do

16

see surprising number of repetition, even though perhaps

17

some are in very urbanized areas and some are in rural

18

areas.

19

QUESTION:

Well, that's -- that's true.

The

20

officers are -- are trained to tell the district court,

21

the finder of fact, all of the factors that entered into

22

their judgment.

23

necessary reading of the Ninth Circuit's opinion, that we

24

now have seven factors that every officer in the Ninth

25

Circuit must memorize and not rely on.

It seems to me, though, a fair reading, a

And I just don't

34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

see how that's consistent with the ability of the police

2

to perform their work or consistent at all with our

3

opinions.

4

us, the Ninth Circuit itself has construed this opinion in

5

subsequent cases precisely that way.

6

And as the court -- as the Government has told

MS. BRAMBL:

Well, the Ninth Circuit, even since

7

this opinion, still examines all of the factors.

8

still look at the totality even in the Sigmond-Ballesteros

9

case that the Government cited in its briefs.

10

QUESTION:

They

However --

You have a point that's a serious

11

point I think.

The first time I see a case where the

12

policeman testifies I -- I stopped this individual because

13

he looked nervous as he came away from the airplane down

14

to the baggage counter, and he looked both ways, and then

15

there was sweat on his upper lip and he walked around the

16

baggage thing, and then, looking around, went over to his

17

suitcase -- the first time you see that, you think, well,

18

that makes sense to me.

19

thing 15 times, you begin to wonder.

20

your point.

21

MS. BRAMBL:

22

QUESTION:

But when you see exactly the same
Now, that I guess is

Well, it -- well, it is.
Okay.

Now, what do we do about that?

23

I had thought that the way to deal with it is -- totality

24

of the circumstances is the way to deal with it, not

25

having rigid rules that say you can never consider whether

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

his -- he was sweating or wasn't sweating.

In other

2

words, I don't see how a rigid rule helps.

It puts too

3

many cases on one -- it gets the wrong cases.

4

draw a sensible line.
Now, what's your view of that?

5
6
7

problem.

It doesn't

I see your

I want to know the solution.
MS. BRAMBL:

Well, I think that the solution is

8

to allow courts like the Ninth Circuit and other circuits

9

to say, look, we see the same thing time and time again,

10

and it really has very little or no meaning.

11

want you to tell us why this factor is suspicious.

12

not going to be enough anymore to come in and just say, he

13

looked nervous, he slowed down.

14

QUESTION:

Officers, we
It's

And --

But that -- and I -- I think your --

15

your point is -- is well taken as far as you go, but it

16

seems to me that that's not going to help the Ninth

17

Circuit opinion here because what you're saying is don't

18

rely on highly general factors which are so general that

19

we really, in the abstract, don't know where they point.

20

Be more specific.

21

that's not -- that's not what the Ninth Circuit said.

22

Ninth Circuit, in effect, said, well, we're -- we're

23

simply going to exclude certain categories of fact.

24
25

Give us facts not conclusions.

MS. BRAMBL:

But
The

Well, as I said, the language the

Ninth Circuit used could have been a lot more clear and a

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

lot more artful.
QUESTION:

2

Well, it might have said what you

3

said, but it didn't say what you said.

4

so?

5

MS. BRAMBL:

I mean, isn't that

Well, they did say frequently, and

6

in effect, when there was a rehearing in this case, they

7

amended the opinion to add under the circumstances of this

8

case and in this case on many, many times.

9

QUESTION:

10

(Laughter.)

11

MS. BRAMBL:

12

QUESTION:

Maybe not often enough.

It would have helped.
Because -- because initially the

13

opinion did read categorically we don't consider slowing

14

down, we don't consider kids waving, and then they threw

15

in a lot of under the circumstances in this case, not in

16

-- in every instance, but in a number of cases.

17

the amendment seems at odds with what the original opinion

18

was, which seemed to be saying we have three categories

19

here: never relevant, sometimes relevant, always relevant.

20

MS. BRAMBL:

And I think you're right.

That's --

They --

21

I wouldn't say that they were categorical in excluding,

22

but they -- they certainly did seem to suggest that --

23

that certain factors were not relevant, and they did add

24

in this case.

25

with the exact same factor and they're not able to show

And basically if someone comes into court

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

why that's relevant or probative in this case, why this

2

factor isn't neutral and does have an inference of

3

criminal activity, then that factor, if you follow the --

4

the other courts follow the Ninth Circuit's opinion it's

5

going to -- it's going to be excluded.

6

be considered as relevant or probative.
I think that that is the kind of guidance that

7
8

It's not going to

the circuits should be offering.
QUESTION:

9

Well, one thing that the circuit

10

didn't do and it did puzzle me was when I read the

11

district court's opinion, I thought the district court was

12

saying, yes, I could go along with they're in a recreation

13

area.

14

turn, it made no sense at all because if that's where they

15

were going to go, they should have gotten right on the

16

highway.

17

-- the -- the Ninth Circuit didn't deal with that as

18

precisely as the district court did.

19

But when it came to a certain point and they made a

That seemed to be unanswered, that.

MS. BRAMBL:

Why wasn't

That's true, but the Ninth Circuit

20

did point out -- and if you look at the map that's on --

21

on page 157 of the joint appendix -- that's the map that

22

we submitted in connection with this case and that the

23

district and the -- the Ninth Circuit considered -- it

24

shows that -- it's got a lot more detail, as far as a lot

25

of the destinations.

And when the Government said that

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

really there weren't any destinations beyond Rucker

2

Canyon, beyond where the stop occurred --

3

QUESTION:

4

MS. BRAMBL:

Where you turn onto Kuykendall?
Yes.

Once you turn onto that road

5

and you keep going, you can see to the east there's a

6

number of campgrounds, a number of areas, including --

7

QUESTION:

8

MS. BRAMBL:

9

QUESTION:

The Chiricahua?
Yes.
Yes, but to go from Douglas to

10

Chiricahua National Monument would be -- would be

11

extremely odd to go the route this minivan took.

12

up -- up 191 and cut over above the checkpoint.

13

MS. BRAMBL:

You'd go

Well, the van was appropriate for

14

that road and the conditions, and I would point out that

15

when the agent had --

16
17

QUESTION:

Well, if it's appropriate, if it's --

it's also appropriate to go on a paved highway, I take it.

18

MS. BRAMBL:

19

QUESTION:

Well, sure, but -I mean, why would you go up this

20

very winding road to a place that you can get to much more

21

quickly by going up a paved highway?

22

MS. BRAMBL:

It might be a -- a matter of

23

preference and -- and taste.

24

beautiful and --

25

QUESTION:

But these areas are

Well, you know, all of these factors

would prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt or that they

3

would amount to probable cause.

4

about is reasonable suspicion.

5

MS. BRAMBL:

But all we're talking

But it isn't suspicious for a

6

family from Douglas to use a road that leads right from

7

Douglas, that start out -- that starts out 10 miles paved,

8

to go through a beautiful area up to perhaps Chiricahua

9

Monument or some of the areas along there on the -QUESTION:

10

Yes.

You can't -- it's obviously

11

nothing criminal.

But what -- what did the respondent

12

say, that he was going to meet somebody there?

13

MS. BRAMBL:

14

QUESTION:

15

going to a recreational area?
MS. BRAMBL:

16

That's correct.
What's -- how does that tie in with

Well -- well, it really doesn't

17

because we know that he was involved in illegal activity,

18

but that's the hindsight of what the officer found after

19

the stop.

And the -- the -QUESTION:

20

Would you comment on a -- on a phase

21

of the case that keeps puzzling me?

The -- the sensors on

22

the road.

23

suspicion on every vehicle that went up here because I

24

guess the first sensor that was triggered caused the

25

officer to -- to go over and take a look at the vehicle,

It must be that the -- that there was some

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and that happened rarely enough, so you make a special

2

examination of every vehicle that trips the sensor.

3

then if they trip the second sensor, that's -- they're

4

doubly suspicious.

5

whole picture?

6

And

And how -- how relevant is that in the

MS. BRAMBL:

Well -- well, I think what's

7

important to recognize is that when you look at the maps,

8

there aren't too many roads that lead anywhere from

9

Douglas because it's right on the border.

So, there's the

10

main road, the paved one, that the district court that Mr.

11

Arvizu should have taken, and then there's this dirt road,

12

the unpaved one, which is quite well-maintained, and they

13

have sensors on that to catch all the cars that avoid the

14

checkpoint.

15

But my point is that every road that leads away

16

from the border is suspicious to some degree and can be

17

labeled that way.

18

It happened to be --

QUESTION:

It is particularly suspicious if

19

there's a much more rapid route available, rapid and

comfortable.

23

If you got three kids in the car, you

MS. BRAMBL:

Well, they were going 50 to 55

miles per hour.

24

QUESTION:

25

MS. BRAMBL:

I know.
And there was no testimony that the

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

car was flying -- the van was flying all over the place,

2

which -- which tells me -- and the pictures bear it out --

3

is that this wasn't -- it was a dirt road and it was in a

4

-- a fairly isolated area, not full of houses and -- and

5

whatnot.

6

But this was a decent road.
QUESTION:

It's not only an isolated area, but

7

the testimony was that the people who normally used the

8

road were locals, ranchers or others, that it was not a

9

road frequently traveled by families.

10
11

MS. BRAMBL:

However, the -- that was the

testimony by the Border Patrol agent.

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. BRAMBL:

Right.
The investigator from our office

14

testified that this road was used and enjoyed by all kinds

15

of families.

16

There are a number of areas within them that -- that are

17

visited by people from all over, and because they're

18

basically in the -- in the residents of Douglas' back

19

yard, people from Douglas frequent that area.

20

don't have a record as to how many sensor hits turn out to

21

be smugglers, how many turn out to be ranchers, and how

22

many turn out to be people from Douglas visiting the area.

23

The Chiricahuas are a beautiful area.

QUESTION:

So, we

But we do have a record that suggests

24

that every time somebody trips the sensor, they go out and

25

take a look at them.

MS. BRAMBL:

2

QUESTION:

3

MS. BRAMBL:

That's true.
Yes.
And -- and it would be a shame if

4

-- if every family on a road like that or on that road in

5

a minivan on a holiday would be subject to heightened

6

scrutiny just because this happens to be a road where

7

smugglers sometimes use it.

8
9

QUESTION:

And --

Is there any indication there ever

has been such a family?

I mean, I imagine if there were

10

an innocent family that happened to accidentally come from

11

an area where there is a lot of smuggling, that doesn't --

12

you know, not everybody is a smuggler in such an area.

13

They drive with their family just for recreation 50 miles

14

out of the way.

Their children wave oddly.

(Laughter.)

Well, one of the problems with --

21

with Fourth Amendment issues is that the vast majority of

22

innocent people that are protected by the Fourth Amendment

23

often remain silent when they are subjected to arbitrary

24

or -- or random stops.

25

QUESTION:

I'd feel much more sympathetic to --

smuggler, but -- and he suspected me to be a smuggler and

he turned out to be right.

accurate.

6

weight to the fact that he turned out to be right?

that -- does that have any bearing on whether the

8

suspicion was reasonable or not?

I don't understand that.

MS. BRAMBL:

9

But the suspicion was not

It doesn't.

Should we give any
Does

In fact, if we had

10

that kind of test, then we would have no way to litigate

11

reasonable suspicion issues because the only way we get to

12

court --

13

QUESTION:

I'm not saying it's conclusive.

I'm

14

just saying, you know, I'm -- I'm more inclined to find

15

that the Border Patrol agent who stops a smuggler had a

16

reasonable suspicion than I am to find that a Border

17

Patrol agent who stops a -- a happy family out on outing

18

had a reasonable suspicion.

19
20
21

MS. BRAMBL:

Well, the problem is there weren't

really any factors or -QUESTION:

How would one know about the stops of

22

someone who is a perfectly law-abiding citizen?

Nobody is

23

pressing charges against them.

24

very few of them would bother with a Bivens action given

25

the qualified immunity.

Quite the contrary.

And

So, we don't hear from those

people.

2

Amendment, frankly, is that you have to protect the crooks

3

because if you don't protect them, then the innocent, the

4

law-abiding people will lose their protection.

5

And I thought the whole idea of the Fourth

MS. BRAMBL:

That's exactly right.

The -- the

6

Fourth Amendment protects all of the law-abiding people,

7

and it seems like Terry struck a balance.

8

stop people when you have reasonable suspicion, but that's

9

the floor below which you cannot go because otherwise

You -- you can

10

you're casting in a large universe of -- of innocent, law-

11

abiding citizens who are going to be stopped.

12

the people that we're concerned about in this litigation.

13

And they're

And obviously our client is not a sympathetic

14

figure because he was doing something wrong.

15

the objective factors that were available to the agent

16

pointed not to a smuggler running dope or aliens, but

17

instead to a family that was on an outing on a -- a lovely

18

day on a -- a very scenic area.

19

But all of

All of the factors that the Ninth Circuit found

20

had some level of suspicion, the fact that it was a

21

minivan, the fact that it was a road that could be used by

22

smugglers and could be used to avoid the sensor, and the

23

fact that it was 45 minutes before a Border Patrol shift

24

change -- all those are really just the setting.

25

get to the individualized factors that were listed, those

When you

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

factors are the ones that fall short.
QUESTION:

2
3

Well, but just before the shift

change is an individualized factor.

4

MS. BRAMBL:

5

QUESTION:

Well -I mean, we're not saying that anytime

6

someone comes along this road it's suspicious.

7

saying it's suspicious just before the shift change.
MS. BRAMBL:

8

We're

Well, it's certainly 45 minutes

9

before a shift change when perhaps, depending on where the

10

agents are out in the field, some of them may be returning

11

back.

12

families, you better find out when Border Patrol shift

13

changes are because otherwise you won't -- you travel on

14

these roads, you're going to get stopped.

15

But it -- it would seem inappropriate to say,

QUESTION:

Would you explain to me the

16

significance of the shift change?

17

understand.

18

MS. BRAMBL:

And --

I frankly didn't quite

Well, the Border Patrol claims that

19

smugglers, in general, are aware of when they change

20

shifts and --

21
22
23

QUESTION:

But what difference would it make --

does that make?
MS. BRAMBL:

Well, the thought is that smugglers

24

would then think they're getting by because all of the

25

agents are at the -- at the station.

The truth of it is,

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

we see this factor so often throughout the -- the

2

published cases, that it seems a strategy, if it is one,

3

that does not work because --

4

QUESTION:

But the idea would be that the Border

5

Patrol agents were all at the checkpoint and wouldn't be

6

out in the field to -- to be able to follow up on any

7

information from the sensor.

8

MS. BRAMBL:

9

QUESTION:

That's exactly right.
But I still don't understand because

10

that would be at the moment of the change.

ahead of time some will be coming in, and 20 minutes after

QUESTION:

Right.

11

MR. SCHLICK:

-- the checkpoint on I-191.

That

drive would take perhaps 45 minutes, perhaps a half hour,

perhaps as much as an hour, depending on where they were.
