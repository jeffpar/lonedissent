ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. CORDRAY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. CORDRAY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May

it please the Court:

11

I represent current and former Government

12

officials who have been sued in their individual capacity

13

based on a claim for denial of access to the courts and

14

the further claim that they violated clearly established

15

law as of 1993, thus negating their defense of qualified

16

immunity.

17

The substantive due process right of access

18

claim urged here is extremely expansive and unsupported by

19

the Court's precedents.

20

The right of access is not violated unless an individual

21

is, in fact, barred from filing claims in the courts.

22

limited circumstances, far different from those at issue

23

here, the Court has recognized that an actual bar to

24

access in the courts implicates the Due Process Clause.

25

Here there is no denial of access to the courts under this

Our position boils down to this.

In

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Court's precedents.

2

The claim asserted here, moreover, would

3

constitutionalize the handling of informal channels of

4

communication between Government officials and private

5

citizens.

6

claim would cause the flow of information to the public to

7

be reduced to stultifying forms of pretrial discovery.

8

know no holding of this Court that would lead to such a

9

result.

10

It's entirely foreseeable that recognizing this

QUESTION:

To begin with right of access, the

11

Bell case, Bell v. Milwaukee, is discussed in -- in the

12

briefs.

13

distinction.

14

It's not -- but suppose that case were here.

15

had the Bell case.

16

correct?

17

We

That's 1983.

This is Bivens.

I recognize the

That's, of course, a circuit court case.
Suppose we

Would you say the Bell case is

MR. CORDRAY:

Your Honor, we feel that the

18

conduct at issue in the Bell case, very serious misconduct

19

-- there were actual criminal violations.

20

perpetrators were prosecuted.

21

address the misconduct at issue in that case.

22

believe that it would state a claim for denial of access

23

to the courts.

24
25

The

There would be many ways to
We do not

We also believe -- and in fact, it's -- the
district court held here the facts of that case are quite

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

distant from this case where here we're in the sensitive

2

context of foreign policy and the oversight of covert

3

operations in a foreign country, and that would result -QUESTION:

4

But your basic position is -- is that

5

there's a police coverup and the police destroy the

6

evidence and they lie, et cetera, no -- no cause of action

7

for denial of access to courts.

8

MR. CORDRAY:

9
10
11

That's correct.

There would be

many remedies that could and should be imposed in such a
case.
QUESTION:

Even where the purpose of the action

12

of the official is to conceal facts that would have

13

provided the basis for a legal recovery in court.

14

MR. CORDRAY:

We believe so, Your Honor, and for

15

this reason.

16

mixed motive test if one of the purposes was to prevent or

17

impede a lawsuit.

18
19

In this case, the court of appeals devised a

QUESTION:

Well, yes, but we're speaking

hypothetically.

20

MR. CORDRAY:

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

And there's some circuit court

22

support for where that's the alleged motive, that that

23

could provide a basis for a suit for denial of access to

24

the court.

25

MR. CORDRAY:

Alleged that that is the sole

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

motive, no other motive.

I mean, it's -- what I'm trying

2

to communicate is it's very difficult in these cases to --

3

to suggest this.
It's very easy to allege that this is one of the

4
5

motives or even the sole motive at a motion to dismiss

6

stage where the -- where the allegations are treated

7

generously and, all of a sudden, all of these claims

8

become constitutional claims.

9

timely disclose information and some irreparable harm

10

results, this could apply, for example, in undercover

11

Government investigations of criminal conduct, sting

12

operations.

13

attorney inquired, there was some intentionally misleading

14

statement made, and therefore, as a result, some

15

irreparable harm occurred, someone was killed during the

16

implementation of the operation, something of that sort,

17

all of these would become denial of access to court --

18

If there's some failure to

If the allegation is made that maybe my

QUESTION:

Suppose that it is an ordinary case,

19

civil case, criminal system, and they're holding -- a

20

group of rogue policemen are unlawfully somebody in a jail

21

cell and his wife comes in and says, I -- I want to get a

22

23

behalf.

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

would that be a -- a denial of access to the courts?
MR. CORDRAY:

In a situation where the

3

Government was holding an individual in custody, therefore

physically barring that person from accessing the courts,

5

that person --

QUESTION:

7

MR. CORDRAY:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. CORDRAY:

10

No, no.

The person -- the wife --

That -- that person --

-- wants to go.
That person would have a claim for

denial of access to the courts.

11

The wife or an attorney inquiring on their

12

behalf, et cetera, do not have a right to Government

13

information.

14

doesn't mean that their attorney inquiring of the

15

prosecutor's office or the police have some right of

16

access to information.

The mere fact that someone is incarcerated

me of the ability to win the suit.

assume 1983 because Bivens has an extra problem.

22

MR. CORDRAY:

Is there denial of

Are we talking about a criminal

23

case, a criminal proceeding?

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. CORDRAY:

Either -A witness -- it would matter if it

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

were a criminal proceeding because there are special fair

2

trial guarantees that the Constitution imposes such as

3

Brady v. Maryland and the like in a -- an ongoing criminal

4

proceeding.

5

prior to any civil case even being filed when we're in the

6

realm of potentially pretrial investigation, discovery of

7

information, people seeking information, that would not

8

constitute a substantive due process right of access to

9

courts claim, we do not believe.

If we're talking about a civil case or here

Again, those facts,

10

again, are far afield from what's at issue in this case,

11

but we don't believe that -- that that would file a claim,

12

would be our position.

13

in this case.

14

QUESTION:

You wouldn't need to go that far

Was a FOIA claim open to the

15

respondent here?

16

been sought and obtained theoretically under FOIA?

17

Could -- could such information have

MR. CORDRAY:

At any time.

At any time.

And in

18

fact, respondent did file FOIA claims later.

19

contention here is that she was lulled into inaction, but

20

of course, it remained open to her at any time to file a

21

FOIA claim.

24

documents.

25

And in fact, she did so.

She received thousands of pages of documents.

Part of the complaint here is that the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

information was not timely disclosed.

2

unfortunate.

3

individuals who should be called to account for it, but it

4

doesn't constitute a substantive right of access to courts

5

claim under the substantive due process line of cases or,

6

you know, all such communications between Government

7

officials and private citizens -QUESTION:

8
9

It's regrettable.

And again, that's

There may even be

Mr. Cordray, may -- may I go back to

your answer about this being like a sting operation?

10

Those are designed to uncover crimes, and the object of

11

the sting is a suspect.

12

someone who was suspected of a crime.

13

someone who was seeking information from her Government

14

for perfectly understandable, appropriate purposes.

15

MR. CORDRAY:

But here, we're not dealing with
We're dealing with

That -- that's true, nor do we

contend otherwise.

18

of those operations is to try to ferret out crime.

19

true.

20

But even a suspect, a criminal

It's

But it -QUESTION:

But couldn't one make a distinction?

21

I mean, you say if this case, then the sting operation,

22

and I think that however you come out in this case, you're

23

not touching the sting case.

24
25

MR. CORDRAY:

I don't believe that's correct,

Your Honor, because a constitutional line can't be founded

We're talking about

Sure.

15

list --

16

The Government is trying to

And the mere fact that someone is

QUESTION:

The person who's being deceived -- I

17

just don't see where there's any spill-over that you can

18

-- you can disassociate the suspect who was being deceived

19

in order to be caught by the Government and someone who

20

was under no suspicion of any involvement in any

21

wrongdoing.

22
23
24
25

MR. CORDRAY:

We don't think a constitutional

line could be -- could be founded there and maintained.
I will say in the case of affirmative
misrepresentations by Government officials or

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

affirmatively misleading statements, there -- there are

2

some circumstances where they perhaps are justified.

3

There are many circumstances where they would not be

4

justified, and if they violate a legal duty, there would

5

be legal redress for the violation of the duty.

6

criminal in nature, there would be -- criminal sanctions

7

could be imposed upon the perpetrators.

People could

vote them out of office.

11

constitute a substantive due process right of access to

12

the courts or an actual denial of access.

13

QUESTION:

But it doesn't in our view

Mr. Cordray, one of your -- one of

14

your arguments here is essentially a lack of standing

15

argument that -- that there's no remediable harm that's

16

been suffered.

17

injunction -- it's -- it's too speculative whether the

18

injunction would ever have issued.

19

in -- in getting damages?

20

constitute harm?

Why -- why is that?

21

MR. CORDRAY:

22

QUESTION:

You say the

But what about a delay

Why -- why doesn't that

A delay in what constitute harm?

In obtaining -- in obtaining damages;

23

that is, had she known this information sooner, she could

24

have brought suit sooner and would have obtained justice

25

sooner.

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CORDRAY:

Again, I don't think that that

2

founds -- that that meets the standing requirements.

3

We're -- we're concerned here about the traceability and

4

redressability requirements.

5

this long skein of hypotheticals here is a notion that an

6

American court order would have somehow have prevented the

7

Guatemalan military from executing her husband.
QUESTION:

8
9

And at the end of all of

Yes, I am not talking about -- I am

not talking about that.

I'm talking about the -- I'm just

10

talking about her ability to get monetary compensation for

11

what the Government did.

12

delayed?

13

that is, yes, well, you know -- but meanwhile, she hasn't

14

gotten it.

15

Hasn't that been at least

You say she can still get it.

MR. CORDRAY:

But the answer to

It may have been delayed.

She

16

does have tort claims that are now pending in district

17

court, intentional infliction of emotional distress,

18

negligent supervision.

19

Federal Tort Claims Act.

20

say that she's not been denied access to the courts.

21

She's pursued that access.

22

She's pursued political relief and the like.

23

QUESTION:

Those are proceeding under the
And so, again, we -- we would

She is vigorously pursuing it.

Is -- are the claims that are now

24

pending against the individuals or the -- the United

25

States has substituted itself?

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CORDRAY:

The United States has substituted

2

itself under the Federal Tort Claims Act for the purposes

3

of those claims.

4
5

They're in discovery in the trial court.

QUESTION:

And what -- they're in discovery

right now?

6

MR. CORDRAY:

7

QUESTION:

Yes, they are.

That's correct.

Would she have had standing if she

8

had clearly brought or clearly adduced the theory that she

9

wanted an injunction against the officials to prevent the

10

officials from continuing to pay money to the agents of a

11

foreign government who were torturing her husband, who in

12

fact was a -- a foreign national?

13

standing if she had made that allegation?

14
15
16
17
18

MR. CORDRAY:
Your Honor.

Would she have had

I'm not certain, to be honest,

It would be very close to the line.

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't she have had?

Let's put

it that way.
MR. CORDRAY:

Well, because -- because there

19

would be, again, a traceability, redressability problem.

20

If she's simply seeking -- her standing is somehow to save

21

her husband's life.

22

to this case --

23

QUESTION:

That's always been the claim asserted

Right, and her -- her allegation is

24

that they are torturing her husband because the United

25

States is paying them to do it.

And she says, on my

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

hypothetical, I want you to enjoin them from paying more

2

money.

3

least in the allegation, would have been very clear,

4

wouldn't it?

5

That -- that -- the -- the causal connection, at

MR. CORDRAY:

It would be close to the line.

6

would still depend on third party responses to a court

7

order, which this Court has had some --

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, she might or might not have

been able to prove ultimately, had it gone to trial, that

10

stopping the money would stop the action of the foreign

11

government.

12

she would have had it, wouldn't she?

13

It

But as a matter of standing to get to trial,

MR. CORDRAY:

I frankly think it's like the

14

Simon case where the issue was availability of tax credit

15

or tax relief, and it was thought that that was not

16

significant enough to influence clearly the third party's

17

contract --

18
19

QUESTION:

Well, then your -- well, was it that

or was it there was no cause of action?

20

MR. CORDRAY:

21

QUESTION:

It was --

Well, we think -- we think both.

But it seems to me you have to take

22

her complaint the way -- the way Justice Souter wrote it.

23

I mean, her complaint --

24

(Laughter.)

25

QUESTION:

Her complaint is that the only reason

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

they're -- they're torturing is because we're paying them

2

to do that.

3

the redressability/causality element is certainly there.

And if that is the allegation, I -- I think

MR. CORDRAY:

4

It would be close to the line

5

because we're talking about independent decisions by third

6

parties in response to a court order would be the issue.

7

That would be the issue.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. CORDRAY:

10

What do you mean third parties?
The third party is the Guatemalan

military who, in the end, have to change their conduct.

11

QUESTION:

No, no, no.

But the injunction is

12

against the payment which she says is the only reason the

13

Guatemalan military are doing this.

14

the American officials from paying the money which she

15

asserts is the sole reason they're going through with

16

this.

She wants to enjoin

Why -- why --

17

MR. CORDRAY:

But the only claim to standing on

18

her part to enjoin the CIA from doing something would be

19

somehow because it affects her husband's well-being and

20

the like.

21

third parties are going to be influenced in a positive way

22

and a decisive way by an American court order, and that's

23

where we think it breaks down.

24

to-the-line case in terms of standing.

25

So, you have to make that further step that the

QUESTION:

But -- but that's a close-

How can you be so cavalier?

It's

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

close to the line.

You -- you win anyway even if it's on

2

the other side of the line?
MR. CORDRAY:

3

We think that there's not standing

4

under Simon and Linda R.S., and we think it's even clearer

5

in a foreign military context where we're talking about

6

foreign nationals not subject to U.S. jurisdiction, who at

7

the end of the chain of reasoning, have to alter their

8

conduct.

9

That's correct.
I'd also like to address --

10

QUESTION:

11

before you leave the subject?

May I just ask you another question

12

MR. CORDRAY:

13

QUESTION:

Sure.

Assume, for the sake of argument,

14

that there is standing in that case.

15

been a cause of action alleged?

16

MR. CORDRAY:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. CORDRAY:

19

Would there have

Here for denial of access to --

On my hypothesis.
For denial of access to the

courts?

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. CORDRAY:

22

access to the courts.

23

before this Court --

Any cause of action.
By Ms. Harbury for denial of
That's the only claim we have

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. CORDRAY:

Yes, yes, yes.
Again, it's distant from any

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

allegations of torture or mistreatment of someone.

2

only talking about denial of access to the courts based on

3

the alleged --

4

QUESTION:

We're

And -- and she said I -- I want to go

5

into court because I want to press this cause of action.

6

One of your arguments is, well, you've got to get into

7

court first, or -- or at least try to get into court.

8

another line of argument is whether you're yet at the

9

courthouse door or not, you've at least got to have a

10
11

But

cause of action that you could press if you got there.
And my question here is, assume standing, assume

12

your second line of argument on access to courts so that

13

the issue comes down to whether there would have been an

14

allegation of a cause of action on that hypothesis.

15

there have been a cause of action alleged?

16

MR. CORDRAY:

Would

We still allege there are many

17

steps on the standing argument in terms of what kind of

18

claims she would have brought.

19

appeals --

20

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
5 years ago in its Glucksberg decision, the

23

Court urged utmost care in creating new substantive due

24

process rights because doing so removes the matter from

25

the arena of public debate and legislative action.

That

1

admonition is acutely compelling in the field of

2

Government-to-citizen communication.

3

would not only constitutionalize the Freedom of

4

Information Act and create a constitutional pre-litigation

5

discovery right against the Government, but would also

6

affirmatively discourage an unquantifiable, but immense

7

volume of valuable informal Government communications that

8

take place thousands of times every day.

9

held in OPM v. Richmond in 1990, the natural consequence

Respondent's theory

As the Court

10

of a rule imposing liability for Government statements

11

would be a decision to cut back and impose strict controls

12

upon Government provision of information.

13

Government officials respond to informal

14

requests for information every day in -- in an infinite

15

variety of contexts with infinite -- with an infinite

16

array of answers, candor, off-the-record disclosures, and

17

occasional polite evasions.

18

of those governmental responses to requests for

20

to you that forms the core of respondent's constitutional

21

theory.

22

One of the most commonplace

Today, the respondent urges that that I will get

24

hard to disprove, in the words of this Court, allegation

25

litigation will become the trigger for expensive,

3

burdensome, and distracting personal suits for damages

will be a drying up of informal Government-to-citizen

intended.

The -- the consequence

So, to constitutionalize the responses in an

11

informal context where the response was not required by

There are lots of different situations where the

And --

We're not suggesting that there's necessary an

16

these exchanges and to create remedies for damages under

MR. OLSON:

Well, precisely.
Is there a right of access to courts

We believe that there is not.

We

believe that in each of those cases, there were

circumstances where there were other rights that were

violated, and that to take the step that those courts

Of course.

As a matter of -- as a

argument, and there is something similar in the -- in the

16

brief, that they had -- that they -- we can't get back to

that that would be a perfectly constitutional response, or

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER K. HARBURY

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. HARBURY:

10
11

We

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case turns upon a very narrow question of

12
13

law, specifically the United States officials take

14

affirmative and wrongful action to deceive a citizen,

15

number one, with the intention of obstructing her or

16

preventing her from proceeding to the courts of law for

17

emergency injunctive relief, and where such affirmative

18

and wrongful conduct and actions of deceit not only delay

19

the filing of that case, but in fact extinguish the cause

20

of action, and when it is known at the time that her

21

husband is in a secret cell being severely tortured and

22

that he is in danger of imminent extrajudicial execution.

23

Ironically I note that today this case is in the highest

24

Court of the land, but it is exactly 10 years and 6 days

25

too late.

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Given the importance of a number of the points

2

that have been made today, I would like to start with a

3

few clarifications.

4

Number one, I'm not arguing here that the

5

petitioners simply were negligent or did not get back to

6

me on time or that they had some duty, when 6 days after

7

my husband's capture, they learned that he was being

8

tortured and secretly detained.

9

a duty to locate me, to knock on my door, and inform --

10
11

I'm not say that they had

and inform me of his situation.
I'm saying that they could not take wrongful and

12

affirmative steps, once I went to them, to deceive me, to

13

tell me that there was no information when, in fact, they

14

had numerous bulletins from the CIA telling them that he

15

was captured alive, that he was undergoing torture, that

16

they were falsifying his death, and when I was speaking

17

with them, that he was still alive and could, in fact,

18

have been saved.

19

Number two, I am not alleging here that the --

20

that the Government officials should have given me

21

sensitive national security information.

22

that they covered up information that was not sensitive,

23

that our own Government has since decided did not

24

constitute state secrets and could have been given to me

25

initially, and that that nonsensitive information had all

I'm alleging

the details I needed in 1993 to approach the courts of law

2

for an emergency injunctive to -- injunction to --

3

QUESTION:

Ms. Harbury, may I ask you --

4

QUESTION:

If -- if this were a -- if this were

5

a private cause of -- of action without governmental

6

actors, it would be just a tort of deceit, I -- I take it.

7

MS. HARBURY:

8

QUESTION:

9

The tort of --

Like a tortious action for deceit if

these were all private actors.

We'll leave the Government

10

out of it.

11

do is to make up for the absence of a tort of deceit under

12

the Federal Tort Claims Act by creating a constitutional

13

right.

14

structurally so far as your argument is concerned?

15

And it seems to me that what you're trying to

Is that what's -- is that what's happening here

MS. HARBURY:

No, Your Honor.

I'm alleging that

16

any kind of affirmative and wrongful conduct by a state

17

official, when the objective and, in fact, the result is

18

to prevent the filing of a lawsuit, access to courts, then

19

-- then a constitutional right has been violated.

20

QUESTION:

I'm suggesting to you that the only

21

reason you -- you must say that is because if you followed

22

the usual course of the law and file an action for deceit,

23

you'd be barred under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

24

is correct, is it not?

25

MS. HARBURY:

That

I believe the Federal Tort Claims

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Act could not have been triggered in the case when one was

2

only asking for injunctive relief, Your Honor.

3

QUESTION:

In -- in the context of a private

4

person, under the law of torts, there is an action for

5

deceit based on the facts that you've -- that you've

6

discussed, is there not?

7

MS. HARBURY:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes, there is.

All right.

And the reason that you

have to show an access -- right of access to court is

10

because, under the Federal Tort Claims Act, you can't sue

11

for deceit.

12

the beginning point here.

13

I mean, that's -- that's where we -- that's

MS. HARBURY:

Isn't that right?

I could not sued for deceit under

14

the Federal Tort Claims Act.

15

but that action, even if I could file it under the Federal

16

Tort Claims Act, would not be focused on the wrong and the

17

injury that I am alleging here.

18

court, when I could have saved my husband's life, has been

19

extinguished wrongfully on the basis of a violation of

20

standard -- of standard duties of conduct.

21

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor,

I'm saying that my day in

Ms. Harbury, on that central

22

question, an issue kept coming up repeatedly in the D.C.

23

Circuit during your argument there, and the court asked,

24

access to court, access to do what?

25

Now, the -- they rejected your claim that there

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was a Fifth Amendment right, a substantive right,

2

involving the Government's participation in -- in the

3

torture abroad.

4

familial relationship.

5

this point is rejecting your claims, your substantive

6

claims, of a wrong to yourself, wrongful conduct engaged

7

in by the United States, access to court for what?

8

have no Fifth Amendment claim, what is there?

9

could you state?

10

They rejected your argument about a

MS. HARBURY:

So, what I don't understand at

If you

What claim

All of the claims that I would

11

have stated, Your Honor, would have been rooted in the

12

context that in the absence of extraordinary

13

circumstances, as in Guatemala in 1992 and '93, the use of

14

torture, the causation and participation in torture by

15

United States officials, was completely outside of the

16

scope of their delegated authorities and, in the

17

alternative, in violation of their own regulations and

18

subject to review under the APA for emergency injunctive

19

relief.

20

to sue for conspiracy to end aiding and abetting, assault

21

and battery in his case, emotional distress in my case,

22

intentional refusal to supervise independent contractors.

23

That core concept would, in turn, have allowed me

And I would still assert that although my

24

familial rights have not been recognized in the Bivens

25

context for a number of good reasons, because there's no

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

easy way to draw the line in damages in that context, but

2

had I gone to a court of law and said, this is my family,

3

I have the right to choose our medical care, I have the

4

right to choose whether or not together we will have

5

children and how we will raise them and which church we

6

shall worship at and what professions we shall exercise,

7

the most fundamental right of all that I would have

8

presented seeking injunctive relief is that I have a right

9

to defend my family from wrongful outside actions,

10

especially when they're taken by the state.

11

brought all of those issues before the courts of law and

12

asked for emergency assistance.

13
14

QUESTION:

At bottom, in this case you're

claiming damages now.

15

I would have

Is that not correct?

MS. HARBURY:

There are some tort claims issues

16

still in the district court, yes, Your Honor, but those

17

cannot make good the lost day in court to save a human

18

life.

19

QUESTION:

No, but -- but what's running through

20

my mind is the -- there's a long chain of causation here,

21

and if -- if one were persuaded -- and I'm not saying I

22

am, but if one were persuaded that even if you had all the

23

help that you sought at the time you did, there still

24

would not have been time to save your husband's life.

25

therefore, the ultimate damage would -- would have been

I would certainly want to bring my

look to the egregious nature of the conduct in a

particular case, but we also have to look at what we're

on that.

14

I think that in

If I may elaborate

Number one, the circuit courts that have dealt

15

with the issue of access to the courts in the context of a

16

Government coverup have created a solution that would so

17

filter out most cases that there would not be a flood gate

18

effect.

19

extinguishing that actual cause of action, as in this

20

case, will not be a harm that in itself, without further

21

damage, is going to be actionable as a constitutional

22

violation for denial of access.

2

The second filter, though, is that there must

3

have been harmful and affirmative and wrongful conduct

4

aimed at obstructing the access to the courts, blocking

5

that person from going to the courts of law.

6

that in the context of deceit, which is presented here,

7

that the statements have to have been intentionally

8

deceptive, not just words of courtesy which would be --

9

QUESTION:

That means

When -- when you say wrongful, Ms.

10

Harbury, you don't mean in violation of any particular

11

statute.

12

You mean something broader than that, don't you?
MS. HARBURY:

In this case it would be a common

13

law -- common law tort, Your Honor, to commit intentional

14

deceit where the person making the deceptive statements is

15

fully aware and intends that a reasonable person will rely

16

on that statement to their detriment.

17

QUESTION:

The Secretary of State is liable for

18

the common law tort of deceit under those circumstances is

19

what you're saying.

20

MS. HARBURY:

I'm saying that where the common

21

law tort of deceit is the wrongful act which was taken in

22

order to block access to the courts of law, then it

23

becomes a constitutional tort.

24

deception I doubt would be actionable in most cases,

25

especially when the words were simply courtesy words and a

The simple act of

2

example, that oh, we're very concerned, a reasonable

3

person would probably not rely on that statement to mean

4

more than we'll write a letter of inquiry for you.

5

But what is set out in this case, what is

6

alleged in this case is that there was an array of

7

statements made by numerous persons in the State

8

Department and other agencies which were intended and

9

which did give a number of false impressions and false

10

understandings, specifically that the United States had no

11

information at all about what was happening with my

QUESTION:

Ms. Harbury, from the time you did --

17

you did get information from the Government ultimately

18

when you brought your Freedom of Information Act suit.

19

From the time you made your request under FOIA until you

20

received that information, how much time elapsed?

MS. HARBURY:

I made the FOIA request in January

of '95.

23

officials in March, and in the ensuing uproar, I then

24

began to get some preliminary documentation later that

25

fall.

A number of disclosures were made by Government

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The reason that I filed my FOIA, for purposes of

2

clarification here, in January is that the 60 Minutes

3

broadcast, for the first time ever, had indicated to me

4

that the U.S. officials were deceiving me, that they

5

weren't --

6

QUESTION:

My -- my point is your -- your theory

7

is, if I hadn't been lulled into the sense that the

8

Government was my friend, I would have immediately filed a

9

FOIA request and I would have gotten this information in

10

time to seek this injunction.

11

there was a 6-month interval from March until September,

12

assuming that September was the date of execution.

13

FOIA lawsuit would have taken more than 6 months to

14

process, then you would not have found out anything in

15

time to bring this injunction action.

MS. HARBURY:

If the

Under those conditions, Your

17

Honor, knowing or believing that my husband could still

of that case.

MS. HARBURY:

Your Honor, I believe the FOIA

2

itself makes provisions for expedited handling where

3

necessary, and I believe that any Federal district court,

using their rights and their equitable remedies for

5

emergency situations, could have ordered the emergency

And in fact, those documents were not sealed

They were being reviewed, actively

Well, would they?

That's -- I mean,

11

obviously reading your story, one is immediately

12

sympathetic, and it's a very sad and difficult.

13

understand that.

14

I

And suppose you were in court and the court

15

might think there are other people with similar stories,

16

and indeed, foreign nationals are quite often perhaps,

17

from what one reads in the paper, subject to very bad

18

treatment at the hands of other foreign nationals.

19

our Government supports some of those and because we must,

20

according to what they say.

21

And

Well, how is a court supposed to know whether,

22

when you have the CIA, when you have one group of foreign

23

nationals hurting another group of foreign nationals, when

24

there's egregious behavior throughout the world and we

25

have to support some -- how in your view can we

distinguish this case from the general problem of foreign

relations, from the general problem of the CIA, from

things that courts by and large don't go into?
MS. HARBURY:

If I may.

I'm not sure if I'm

understanding your question, Your Honor.

6

QUESTION:

Well, I'm really trying to work

7

getting you to address what I would see as a major

8

implication, which is not at all casting doubt on -- on

9

the sympathy with which an individual might have, but

10

rather the problem of conducting foreign affairs, which

11

we're told by the Government requires courts to stay out

12

of certain things and your thing is in that category that

And I'd like you to say what you

No, no.

There's

I'm thinking of the case

within the case because, after all, you have to have had a

claim that a judge would have gone and addressed,

otherwise the blocking you from that wouldn't have

23

mattered.

MS. HARBURY:

Yes, Your Honor.

although as in the redistricting cases, it's not that they

don't touch on a political question, or in this case a

foreign affairs question, but they would have not required

There would have been a very limited question

14

presented, which is may the CIA, in the absence of any

15

extraordinary circumstances such as war or imminent

16

national security crisis, in the absence of any of those

17

conditions, may they request and pay for information they

18

know is being contemporaneously extracted through the use

19

of extreme torture and refuse to, in any way, instruct or

20

supervise their own contractors and, in addition, shield

21

those very assets, or informants in this case, from

22

Congress which was trying at that time to force the

23

Guatemalan military to better respect human rights.

24
25

In fact, our foreign affairs policy at that time
was to promote human rights in Guatemala where the army

of very good reasons.

3

operators with respect to the peace process, in respect --

4

and with respect to promotion of human rights were

5

undercutting the foreign affairs.

6

-- or the court in the United States, by taking action in

7

1993, would simply have settled whether or not the CIA may

8

pay for torture in the absence of any extraordinary

9

circumstances.

10

QUESTION:

And these actions of rogue

This Court, by taking

May I -- your answer raises this

11

question in my mind.

12

1993 with the complaint coming in and you think you're

13

right, you should get relief, do you think the relief that

14

would have been ordered by the -- the proper relief at

15

that time would have been simply an order not to pay any

16

more money to the Guatemalan people, or would it have been

17

broader relief covering all the matters you've discussed?

18

MS. HARBURY:

If you say you're the trial judge in

I would have asked in 1993 for

19

three steps to have been taken by the CIA through --

20

through an injunctive -- through an injunction by the

21

courts.

22

Please don't ask for more information and promise to pay

23

for it, especially when those payments are often 20 to 30

24

times more than the annual national salary in Guatemala.

2

would the first have been?

3

What -- what would the injunction say on that first point?

would have been to prohibit CIA officials from requesting

MS. HARBURY:

The CIA was not properly reporting

my husband's situation to Congress at the time, and the

petitioners in this case were repeatedly writing to

Congress saying there is no information about Mr. Bamaca

were being made to everyone else.

There was so much information appropriate for

declassification that I could have been inside of a court

We have no information.

appropriate today.

1

What in your opinion should the CIA do if it discovers

2

that other people not in the CIA are engaged in this?

3

MS. HARBURY:

Questions that I would leave to

4

Congress and that are not raised in this case would be may

5

-- may a CIA agent purchase information from someone known

6

to be an unsavory character.

7

That's not presented here.

The question in -- that's presented here, the

facts that are presented here is when you have an

extremely close and supervisory relationship with a given

1

MS. HARBURY:

carrying out torture was outside the scope of any

statutory delegation of power to the CIA or in violation

4

of its own internal policies and regulations.

You're relying on the statutes or

lack of statutory authority to do it.

of any -- any internal regulations they might have for

of the Constitution because the D.C. Circuit threw that

out.

violated a regulation to torture someone abroad, but it --

14

I have to accept for purposes of this case that it didn't

15

violate the U.S. Constitution.

16

There's something just unseemly about your saying it

Leaving that issue aside, it

certainly violated any authority ever delegated by

from the time of our Founding Fathers right up through the

24

being.

defense, but it didn't choose to do that.

you envision to be the nature of that defense?

MS. HARBURY:

What -- what do

If the petitioners wished to

present to the district court an affirmative defense in

the answer, which has, of course, not yet been filed --

7

we're still at the motion to dismiss stage -- stating that

somehow there were overriding national security interests

which forced them or justified their actions in this case,

10

that -- that met the strict scrutiny test of a fundamental

11

right such as access to the courts, if they wish to make

12

that statement and try to provide that evidence, then I

13

would wish to come to the courts of law and provide my

14

evidence of pretext that that -- those extraordinary

circumstances of national security did not at all exist in

And it would

And I'm free to answer.
Lastly I -- I don't believe that the 1983 -- the

19

we remember that even in such cases as the conduct of our

military affairs in the Chappell case, for example, or in

21

U.S. v. Stanley, although enormous latitude is given to

22

our officials and we have decided not to engage or to

23

provide Bivens remedies under those contexts, in all of

24

those contexts, it has been noted that equitable relief

25

would still be correct and adequate.

So, I believe that

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

my right in 1993 to move forward and obtain equitable

2

relief is without question.

3

Lastly, addressing the issue of -- of qualified

immunity for the petitioners here, the issue of access to

the courts is not a newfangled cause of action.

States Constitution.

15

The -- it wasn't an express right of

MS. HARBURY:

I believe in that case the

16

question was the denial of the right of citizens from

17

another State, in Ohio, to actually file suit, and similar

18

to In re Hull, it was interpreted as barring the

19

courthouse door.

20

QUESTION:

But it was decided not under some

21

substantive constitutional principle, but under the -- the

22

full faith and credit or Interstate Commerce Clause, was

23

it not?

24
25

MS. HARBURY:

That's correct.

But the Court, in

discussing those issues, noted the fundamental importance

48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of the access to courts and the equal access to courts of

2

all citizens.

3

I believe that it was clear enough and very

4

clearly established in all of the other circuit cases and

5

in the long line of cases, due process and access to

6

courts that this Court has always given, that the rights

that I had in 1993 as in today were very clearly

established.

affirmative steps, in this case intentional deceit,

knowing that a person will reasonably rely to their

taken, whether it be locking a packet of evidence in a

the Government acts to conceal information and takes

20

wrongful steps as opposed to simply passively standing by

21

or stating no comment, and the harm occurs as planned, and

the case is not simply delayed but destroyed, in that case

MR. CORDRAY:

Thank you, Your Honor.

At a minimum, the extent of legitimate debate

10

about atrocious treatment of individuals in foreign

11

countries.

12

It has occurred throughout this century.

But before the Court today is a one particular

informed, Government officials denied a substantive due

15

process right of access to courts asserted by respondent

16
