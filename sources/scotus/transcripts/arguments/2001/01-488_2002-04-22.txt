CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

next in No. 01-488, Timothy Stuart Ring v. Arizona.
Mr. Hurwitz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW D. HURWITZ
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HURWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Apprendi v. New Jersey, this Court held that

11

the Sixth Amendment guarantee of jury trial extends to the

12

finding of any fact that exposes the defendant to a

13

greater sentence than he could have received on the basis

14

of the jury verdict alone.

15

controls this case.

16

We submit that that principle

In Arizona, a defendant convicted of first

17

degree murder may be sentenced on the basis of the jury

18

verdict alone only to a sentence of life imprisonment.

19

The judge in Arizona has no power, no legal discretion

20

under the law to sentence a convicted first degree murder

21

defendant to death.

22

QUESTION:

Well, if you're correct, Mr. Hurwitz,

23

I take it we would have to overrule not merely Walton, but

24

Clemons against Mississippi, Cabana against Bullock, and

25

Spaziano against Florida.
3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. HURWITZ:

Your Honor, let me take those

2

cases separately because I do not think that at least two

3

of them are implicated by the position that we urge today.

4

Certainly Walton would be have to be -- would be

5

overruled because it's directly on point.

6

And certainly, to the extent that Spaziano says

7

that a judge may, in the first instance, make the finding

8

of fact to -- to -- of -- of an aggravating circumstance

9

in order to allow a death sentence, it would be also -- it

10

would be also implicated and overruled by the position we

11

urge today.

12

With respect to Clemons, Clemons was a case in

13

which a jury made findings of fact on multiple counts that

14

allowed a defendant to be sentenced to death, and the

15

issue on appeal was rather whether, one of more of those

16

factors having fallen out, the remaining factors could be

17

weighed against mitigating factors for purposes of

18

determining in the sentencing phase, the discretionary

19

phase of the -- of the capital punishment issue, whether

20

or not there could be imposed a capital punishment at that

21

point.

22

our position today.

So, I do not believe that Clemons is implicated by

23

Rather, our point is very --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. HURWITZ:

How about Cabana?
Cabana, Your Honor, I suggest is a
4

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

more difficult question.

Its reasoning would be

2

implicated by our position today, but I -- as we suggested

3

in our brief, I think there is a distinction.

4

-- or Cabana -- the issue was whether or not a particular

5

sentence, where all the facts necessary under State law

6

had been found by the jury, was unconstitutional as

7

applied to a particular defendant.

8

applied analysis is the kind of thing that judges

9

typically do.

In Cabana

That sort of as-

They look at the law and lay it next to the

10

facts of the case and determine whether or not that law,

11

as applied, is unconstitutional with respect to a

12

particular defendant or a particular sentence.

13

The issue posed by -- by this case and by

14

Apprendi is, I think, a quite different one.

15

State law expressly requires a number of factors as a

16

prerequisite to the imposition of a particular penalty,

17

the maximum penalty allowed by law, whether or not the

18

State can systematically deny to defendants in those cases

19

the right to a jury trial.

20
21

QUESTION:

It is when

What other States have schemes that

under your position would also fail the Apprendi test?

22

MR. HURWITZ:

Your Honor, we -- I think we

23

attempted to summarize the -- the status on page 38 of our

24

brief.

25

systems would be implicated by this.

We think there are eight or nine States whose
But what is not

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

clear in all of those States -- and to take Florida as an

2

example, Your Honor -- is whether or not in a system

3

which, as this Court suggested in Jones, where the jury

4

makes, by implication or by necessity, a finding of a

5

particular aggravating factor in order to recommend a

6

death sentence, whether or not that system would -- would

7

be affected by the principle that we urge.

8

those States where there is no jury involved in finding

9

the necessary aggravating circumstance would be the ones

Certainly

10

that would be implicated, and I would suggest that that

11

category is probably somewhat less than the category in

12

footnote 35 of our brief.

13

It is clear, however, that whatever the effect

14

on other States, Arizona's system precisely complies and

15

precisely matches up to the rule that this Court announced

16

in Apprendi.

17

judge to impose this sentence of death without first

18

finding a fact that Arizona's State law specifies is

19

necessary for the imposition of that maximum punishment.

20

And under that circumstance, we suggest there is no basis

21

for distinction of Apprendi.

22

It is simply not possible in Arizona for a

Now, the State has suggested in this case that

23

one basis for a distinction is that the Arizona statute

24

says, within one single statute, the range of punishment,

25

the possible punishment for first degree murder is either
6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

life -- life without possibility of parole, or death.

2

I would suggest that distinction makes no difference.

3

But

Certainly in the Jones case, the precursor to

4

Apprendi, a case that this Court considered a year before

5

Apprendi, a single statute set forth the range of

6

punishment.

7

considered only several weeks ago, where the government

8

conceded that section 841, the drug statute, was covered

9

by Apprendi, several different punishments are set forth

10

In the Harris case, the case this Court

in a single statute.

11

It is difficult to believe that Apprendi would

12

have been -- come out differently, that there would have

13

been a different result in that case, if the statute

14

instead read there's a possible punishment of 20 years for

15

discharging a firearm with racial motivation, but the last

16

5 years may not be imposed.

17

in the absence of racial motivation.

18

QUESTION:

You may not exceed 15 years

If we were to accept your position,

19

Mr. Hurwitz, what would it do to the Federal Sentencing

20

Guidelines?

21

MR. HURWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, let me focus on

22

only one aspect of the sentencing guidelines because it

23

seems to me that there's no implication whatsoever for

24

downward departures and that the -- this Court has already

25

made clear, as the guidelines themselves say, that you
7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

can't exceed the maximum sentence provided by the

2

underlying substantive statute.

3
4

7

So, if I can focus on the question of what would
happen -QUESTION:

Upward -- upward adjustments within

the maximum.
MR. HURWITZ:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

With

8

respect to those, I think there is a distinction, and let

9

me suggest it to the Court.

10

In Arizona, the -- the judge simply has no legal

11

power, no discretion, no ability whatsoever to impose a

12

sentence greater than life in the absence of finding a

13

particular aggravating circumstance specified by the State

14

in its statutes.

15

With respect to the sentencing guidelines, a

16

judge has discretion, and we know that because you review

17

sentencing decisions for abuse of discretion.

18

judge has the legal discretion to impose a sentence in

19

excess of the so-called presumptive range upon the finding

20

or upon noting in the record any number of particular

21

facts, not specified by statute.

22

QUESTION:

So, the

Yes, but he didn't -- it's a strange

23

kind of discretion that can be reversed on appeal.

He

24

doesn't have discretion.

25

guidelines is to eliminate the discretion, to say you must

2

give this sentence if these factors exist.
MR. HURWITZ:

Justice Scalia, my point is, I

3

think, that in our case the judge has no power at all.

He

4

can never find -- he can never exceed that particular

5

limit, the limit being life, in the absence of -- in the

6

absence of finding a fact specified by the State, a fact

7

chosen by the State as necessary to impose the sentence.

8

The sentencing guidelines strike me as somewhat

9

distinguishable because the range of factors that a judge

10

may choose to depart upwards is -- is by the guidelines

11

relatively unlimited.

12
13

QUESTION:

Well, in -- in this case, the

aggravating fact was killing for pecuniary gain.

14

MR. HURWITZ:

15

QUESTION:

Correct, Justice --

And that was clearly implicit, if not

16

explicit, in the jury's finding.

17

MR. HURWITZ:

18

this case, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. HURWITZ:

I -- I would suggest neither in

They didn't find a robbery?
The jury found a robbery, but

21

under Arizona law, as the cases make quite clear, in order

22

in a felony murder case for there to be a finding of

23

pecuniary gain, or in any murder case to be a finding of

24

pecuniary gain, there must be a showing that the murder

25

itself was motivated by a desire for pecuniary gain.
9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

And

1

the Arizona Supreme Court has said on three or four

2

occasions it is not enough that a murder was committed in

3

connection with a robbery or, indeed, even in connection

4

with a felony murder.

5

particular homicide.

6

The issue is motivation for the

In this case, the Arizona Supreme Court said

7

expressly we can't tell from the trial record why the

8

driver was killed.

9

trial record as to why the driver was killed.

There is virtually no evidence in this
It was on

10

the record made in the post-trial proceedings, the record

11

made on the basis of the accomplice testimony, that the

12

Arizona Supreme Court concluded that.

13

So, in this case when the Arizona Supreme Court

14

says two things -- one is the issue for pecuniary gain is

15

whether or not there has been proof of the motivation for

16

the murder, and second, in this case we can't tell why the

17

person was murdered -- I would suggest there is neither a

18

necessary, implicit, or even logical finding by the jury

19

in this case of -- of pecuniary gain.

20

Court I think addressed that issue quite straightforwardly

21

and directly.

22

The Arizona Supreme

Now, the State suggests that one distinction

23

between this case and Apprendi is the idea that these

24

aggravating circumstances are so-called sentencing

25

factors, not elements of the crime.

But I think that --

10

What this Court said in Apprendi was that the

function.

5

State law to allow the judge to sentence somebody to the

6

maximum sentence provided by law?

7

whether you call these aggravating circumstances

8

sentencing enhancements or whether you call them elements,

9

you arrive, I would suggest, at the same result.

10
11

The real test is one of

Is this a fact that is necessary under the

And plainly it is, and

This

case on its face is covered by Apprendi.
One way to -- one way to -- to get into that

12

issue is to -- is to imagine the following circumstance.

13

Let's assume that Arizona law, instead of providing

14

precisely what it does now, said instead that the penalty

15

for first degree murder is life without -- is life with

16

possibility of parole.

17

to life without possibility of parole upon finding of one

18

of 10 specific aggravating circumstances, so that we had

19

exactly the same statute that we have now, but at the

20

first level you get life with possibility of parole after

21

25 years, and at this next level, you got life without

22

possibility of parole.

23

doubt, under those circumstances that on its face the rule

24

this Court set forth in Apprendi would apply.

25

QUESTION:

But that penalty may be increased

I don't think there could be any

I think that's true, and I think that

1

in the -- in the normal circumstance when a State does

2

something like that, even if it is not calling it an

3

element of the crime, it is an element of the crime.

4
5

What we have here, however, this -- this statute
was enacted in -- in what?

6

MR. HURWITZ:

7

QUESTION:

'73?

Initially in '73, Justice Scalia.

Which was the year after Furman.

8

what Arizona was saying was, you know, we -- we never

9

thought we had to have any finding of aggravated --

And

10

aggravating factors in order to impose the death penalty,

11

but the Supreme Court, in a decision that -- that had no

12

-- no rooting in the common law, said that we cannot

13

impose capital punishment without aggravating

14

circumstances.

15

circumstances necessary and we'll have that finding made

16

by a judge.

17

Okay.

We'll make a finding of aggravating

Now, I -- I don't regard that as Arizona

18

adopting the aggravating circumstance as an element of the

19

crime, nor does the statute read that way.

20

you're talking about something that is unprecedented in --

21

in the common law.

22

has been mandated by the Supreme Court and the issue is

23

whether the finding mandated by the Supreme Court has to

24

be made by the jury or -- or the judge.

So, you're --

1

Now, why isn't --

2

MR. HURWITZ:

3

QUESTION:

4

Justice --

-- why isn't that enough to resolve

the case?

5

MR. HURWITZ:

Justice Scalia, if the -- if the

6

point here is that the State was forced to do this and,

7

therefore, this cannot be an element under the Apprendi

8

test, I would suggest that presents several analytical

9

problems.

10

The first is that this Court has said on any

11

number of occasions to the States, here is something that

12

must be in your law.

13

decided Furman or the year before, it decided Miller, and

14

in Miller it said if you want to have a constitutional

15

obscenity law, State, you must have a specific definition

16

in that State -- in the law of the kind of conduct that

17

you wish to -- to punish, the kind of -- the depiction of

18

the kind of conduct that you wish to punish.

19

telling you, States, by the way, what specific factor you

20

have to have.

21

The very same term that this Court

You decide.

We're not

Here are some suggestions.

Arizona, the year after Miller was decided,

22

amended its statutes to add to its obscenity laws a

23

specific requirement with respect to proof of specific

24

types of sexual conduct.

25

The Constitution made them do that.

This Court made them do that.
But I do not believe

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it would be suggested that those specific elements of the

2

crime, those specific factors that are necessary to impose

3

the maximum punishment allowed by law, are somehow

4

exempted from the Sixth Amendment for that reason.

5

QUESTION:

No, but in -- in the -- in the

6

obscenity field, we didn't invite the kind of procedure

7

that -- that was adopted here by -- by establishing a

8

separate -- a separate category, the -- you know, the --

9

the guilt phase and the penalty phase.

We -- we invited

10

the -- the severing of the trial into those -- into those

11

two portions.

12

the constitutional requirement that we've imposed upon the

13

States requires a finding by the judge or a finding by the

14

jury.

15

it's an element of the crime and therefore has to be found

16

by the jury.

17

does the Constitution, as interpreted by this Court,

18

demand.

It's -- it's simply not was simple as to say, well,

19
20

And it seems to me it's up to us whether

It's -- it's rather what does the -- what

MR. HURWITZ:

Justice Scalia, let me -- let me

come at that at -- at two levels.

21

The first one is I think the basic

22

constitutional principle that underlies the Sixth

23

Amendment.

24

in both Jones and Apprendi, is the notion that before

25

you're handed over to the State and before the State is

And that principle, as this Court articulated

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

allowed to exact the maximum punishment permitted by law,

2

a jury of your peers is allowed to you to find those facts

3

to put the State in that position.

4

principle is directly implicated by the death penalty

5

situation on its face.

6

Amendment principle strikes me as no different.

7

Certainly that

So, this underlying Sixth

With respect to bifurcation, there is, of

8

course, no constitutional requirement that the aggravating

9

circumstances be found in a penalty phase of the trial.

10

This Court has made clear on any number of occasions that

11

the aggravating circumstances, these so-called narrowing

12

circumstances, the facts necessary under State law to

13

allow the imposition of a death penalty can be found in

14

the so-called guilt phase of the trial.

15

QUESTION:

But if -- if Apprendi was based on a

16

long common law history, as -- as it certainly seems to

17

have been, wouldn't that distinguish it from the

18

aggravating/mitigating, which certainly is not based on

19

common law history at all?

20

MR. HURWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, it strikes me

21

that the common law history here makes the central

22

principle.

23

history is, after all, the one that Apprendi and Jones

24

articulate about the protection of the Sixth Amendment.

25

The procedure faced in Apprendi was not known at the

The central principle in the common law

The procedure of having a specific

QUESTION:

Yet, this Court in Apprendi

I think that's --

Mr. Hurwitz, may I ask why you have

8

-- you have certainly made a case about the aggravating

9

circumstances, but you haven't put, as part of that case,

10

the so-called Enmund/Tison findings.

11

that if in Arizona someone can be put to death only if he

12

was the triggerman, or was a -- what is the other phrase,

13

a major participant, you haven't made anything of those

14

factors, and I think if -- if the aggravating factor has

15

to be found by the jury, then surely those would have to

16

be as well.

17

MR. HURWITZ:

And it seems to me

Justice Ginsburg, that may well be

18

the case.

As I think I suggested in response to the Chief

19

Justice's initial question, it -- it has struck us that

20

there is a difference between the sort of as-applied

21

analysis that an Enmund/Tison finding requires, a

22

proportionality analysis, and the issue of whether the

23

State systematically denies with respect to a particular

24

factor that it's picked out, and nothing in this Court's

25

jurisprudence required the State to adopt any particular
16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

aggravating circumstance.

2

With respect to those particular factors, it

3

strikes us that's at the core of Apprendi.

I don't resist

4

the suggestion that perhaps the principle in Apprendi

5

extends farther, and it extends to -- to the Enmund/Tison

6

findings.

7

of Apprendi, the very central holding of the case

8

necessarily extends to facts which the State itself has

9

said in its statutes are necessary in order to find -- in

What I do suggest is that -- is that the core

10

order to allow the maximum punishment to be imposed by

11

law.

12
13

QUESTION:

But -- but the other factor you

haven't discussed is the mitigating circumstances.

14

MR. HURWITZ:

15

QUESTION:

Correct, Justice Kennedy.

The common law, in defining elements,

16

doesn't usually have some factors on the other side that

17

-- that are mitigating.

18

suggest some examples where they do.

19

very much, it seems to me, to show that this is part of

20

our Eighth Amendment protections that have been mandated.

21

In Apprendi, the judge could always, once he or she found

22

the racial animus, enhance the sentence; in fact, had to.

23

Here there's still a balancing that has to take place and

24

-- and that -- that certainly is -- is not something

25

classically reserved for the function and province of the

Perhaps -- perhaps you can

MR. HURWITZ:

Justice Kennedy, and we don't suggest that mitigating

be found by the jury.

once the judge was empowered to enter the maximum sentence

allowed by law, that judge could consider whatever factors

or the State could consider, in -- in whatever form it did

so, those factors that might provide for a sentence of

11

QUESTION:

What about that kind of argument that

12

initially Justices Stewart and Powell and Stevens have

13

made, that there's a necessary connection between the

14

determination that death in a case is not cruel and

15

unusual and the jury is doing the weighing in order to

16

show that it reflects a community sentiment in that

17

community that the death penalty is not cruel and unusual?

18

MR. HURWITZ:

And, Justice Breyer, had this

19

Court accepted that as -- as a correct statement of the

20

Eighth Amendment, we obviously wouldn't be here today.

21

We're operating -- we're operating with the constraints of

22

this Court's decisions which have said that kind of jury

weighing, that kind of jury sentencing is not required

MR. HURWITZ:

If it were open, it's an argument

we might make, but it is -QUESTION:

Well, presumably you would make any

argument that's open to you.

6

MR. HURWITZ:

We're open.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. HURWITZ:

9

But -- but my point is it's not an argument we

To be sure, Mr. Chief Justice.

10

need make in this case.

We are not suggesting that jury

11

sentencing is required.

We are suggesting that jury fact

12

finding is required.

13

And if I might, let me suggest the difficulties

14

of adopting a rule that somehow has one -- one approach if

15

something was done pre 1972 and another one after.

16

Arizona had adopted this very same statute identically

17

worded in 1965, when the ALI first suggested it as a

18

possibility to the States, it seems to me clear, on the

19

basis of Apprendi, that the aggravating circumstances

20

would be elements, or at least sentencing enhancements, as

21

the Court said, and required to be found by the jury.

22

QUESTION:

If

But if it adopted the statute in

23

1965, it could have simply had the exact language that it

24

had and said the decision as to whether death or life is

25

simply up to the discretion of the judge, and it would

been decided at that time, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

Because Apprendi and Jones had not

QUESTION:

And because Furman had not been

decided.

6

MR. HURWITZ:

To be sure.

But my point is that

7

if this Court -- this Court will enact an unworkable

8

system if what it does is start looking at State statutes

9

and trying to determine whether or not particular factors

10

in those statutes arose in response to Furman, before

11

Furman, after Furman.

12

One example is suggested in our brief.

The

13

State of New York in the mid-1960s determined to narrow

14

its capital punishment laws and apply them only when the

15

victim was a peace officer.

16

1988.

17

from this Court, or was Arizona's decision because, as New

18

York, it made a policy decision?

Arizona made that decision in

Was Arizona's decision in response to a mandate

19

QUESTION:

Arizona has decided to apply its

20

capital punishment only to when the victim was a peace

21

officer?

22

MR. HURWITZ:

No.

That's one of the -- one of

23

the narrowing circumstances in Arizona law.

And my -- my

24

point, Mr. Chief Justice, is let's assume two States, one

25

of which made that decision in 1965, and another one made
20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that decision in 1988, and it was the only aggravating

2

circumstance that that State had adopted.

3

Court then say, with respect to State number one, the

4

aggravating --

5

QUESTION:

Would this

But here it's a whole procedure

6

designed to have express mitigation and -- and aggravation

7

to be considered by the same trier of fact and balanced.

8

And you -- you seem to give again very -- very little

9

force to the mitigation aspect.

10

MR. HURWITZ:

Justice Kennedy, I don't mean to.

11

I think it is entirely appropriate and entirely possible

12

for a State to design that weighing and that mitigation

13

issue to a -- to a jury.

14

not only in this context, but in other contexts, that --

15

that a defendant is not entitled to a jury trial to

16

establish mitigation from the maximum sentence that the

17

law might allow.

18

But this Court has made clear,

Once again, I would return, I think, to the

19

underlying Sixth Amendment principle, as this Court stated

20

it in Jones and Apprendi.

21

before a defendant was put, in effect, into the tender

22

mercies of the State to be -- to be subjected to whatever

23

sentence the law might allow, first that defendant got the

24

right to have a jury of his peers find the facts that were

25

necessary to do so.

The notion was in 1791 that

He did not have the right at that
21

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

time to have a jury of his peers find whatever facts might

2

persuade the sentencer to give him less than the maximum

3

allowed by law.

4

So, I would suggest that when you return to the

5

underlying Sixth Amendment principle here, it does provide

6

a distinction between facts that would call for leniency

7

and facts that -- that are necessary under the State's law

8

to impose a particular sentence.

9

QUESTION:

Except that Arizona has designed its

10

system, and you could design other systems, but it's

11

designed its system in order to sort out the most culpable

12

offenders and it uses this balancing mechanism.

13
14
15

MR. HURWITZ:

Well, I would separate, Justice

Kennedy, the two parts of the death penalty process.
There is a sorting at the front end.

There is a

16

narrowing that is required in order to determine which

17

defendants among all those convicted of homicide are, in

18

effect, the most culpable and can be sentenced to death.

19

There is a second proceeding.

The second

20

proceeding is the sentencing proceeding.

And what this

21

Court has made clear is that with respect to that first

22

proceeding, there must be specified facts.

23

Furman analysis.

24

that we contend is required under the Constitution to be

25

found by the jury.

That's the

And that's the aggravating circumstance

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

With respect to the second decision, this Court

2

has made plain on any number of occasions that that can be

3

made a discretionary decision for the judge.

4

Proportionality measurements are no longer required at

5

that level.

6

just have to let the defendant have the opportunity at

7

that circumstance to argue for individualized treatment or

8

to argue about leniency, to bring the facts pertinent to

9

his case to the attention of the court.

What this Court has said, however, is you

So, I would

10

suggest it is at this first stage, this narrowing stage,

11

that the Apprendi principle applies.

12

QUESTION:

What you're saying is you're not

13

entitled to a finding of -- of mitigation.

14

entitled to a finding of -- of aggravation.

15

MR. HURWITZ:

You are

Precisely so, Justice Scalia.

And

16

I -- and I think not only are you not entitled to it, but

17

-- but there is nothing in this Court's jurisprudence that

18

requires that the State specify a particular fact in

19

mitigation.

20

Here we have facts chosen perhaps under the

21

compulsion of the Constitution, but nonetheless chosen by

22

the State as necessary prerequisites to the punishment.

Unless the Court has other questions, I will
reserve the balance of my time.

General Napolitano, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANET NAPOLITANO

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MS. NAPOLITANO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

Opposing counsel began with Apprendi, but let me

7

take up on the suggestion by Justice Scalia that this case

8

really begins with Furman because after Furman, the States

9

were left with the mandate that death penalty decisions

10

could not be left unguided under the Eighth Amendment, but

11

requires a standard of judgment.

12

Some States imposed mandatory death sentences, a

13

practice this Court later found unconstitutional.

14

contrast, Arizona amended its death penalty statute to

15

comply with Furman by adding a series of factors which the

16

judge would take into account in choosing between the

17

alternative punishments of life or death.

18

In Walton, this Court fully considered and

19

upheld the constitutionality of Arizona's law.

20

question now is whether at this late date Apprendi

21

requires you to overrule Walton.

22

Apprendi is a Sixth Amendment issue.

23

this case Ring concern the Eighth Amendment.

24
25

In

The

And the answer is no.
Furman, Walton, and

In addition, principles of stare decisis are
heavily implicated here because, as Chief Justice
24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Rehnquist mentioned, there have been any number of

2

precedents in this Court that would be implicitly, if not

3

explicitly, overruled should this Court overrule Walton.

4

Let me, if I might, turn to two important

5

distinctions between Ring and -- and Apprendi.

6

substantive and one I would call formal.

7

The substantive distinction is this.

One is

The

8

sentencing statute in Arizona derived from Furman.

9

passed in 1973.

It was

The pecuniary gain aggravating factor was

10

one of the original aggravating factors in that statute.

11

There was never a -- a suggestion that Arizona was playing

12

a game, moving something that previously had been an

13

element into the sentencing factor side of the statute.

14

There's never been any suggestion that this was anything

15

other than a way to decide which of all first degree

16

murders deserve the death penalty.

17

QUESTION:

Are we going to have to try to figure

18

that out case by case with -- with respect to every

19

State's statute, as Mr. Hurwitz suggested we -- we would

20

have to do?

21

MS. NAPOLITANO:

22

QUESTION:

Your Honor, I think --

I mean, what about the New York

23

statute that -- you know, that makes an aggravating

24

circumstance the death of a -- of a peace officer?

25

MS. NAPOLITANO:

Your Honor, I think what you
25

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

have to do is just look at what was the underlying first

2

degree murder statute, what is the underlying statute

3

which gives rise to the possibility of a death penalty.

4

In Arizona, the underlying first degree murder

5

statute has been the same since 1901, and in fact, around

6

the country, most first degree murder statutes can trace

7

their routes to England in terms of how they are defined,

8

the mens rea, the actus reus, and the causation

9

requirements.

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. NAPOLITANO:

12
13

But you're -It's not a difficult process to

go through.
QUESTION:

But you're saying -- the implication

14

of what you're saying is that any, in effect, departure or

15

innovation in the modern law which doesn't have a clear

16

antecedent, at least as of the time of the -- of the

17

framing, is exempt -- is a fact exempt from the jury trial

18

requirement.

19

that rule in order to see it your way.

20

I mean, that's -- that -- we'd have to adopt

MS. NAPOLITANO:

No.

No, Your Honor, you would

not have to adopt such a blanket rule.

suggesting is this.

24

unequivocally derives from this Court's Eighth Amendment

25

jurisprudence, some of the Sixth Amendment questions that

condition, the jury trial guarantee applies.

MS. NAPOLITANO:

If this

of the legislature, what does it mean to be an element of

If it's a fact necessary, et cetera, it's got to

MS. NAPOLITANO:

Well, I think in -- in looking

17

at McMillan and Jones and Apprendi and that whole line,

18

there has been a question created by this Court as what is

19

an element because if it's an element, what this Court has

said is it has to be charged, it has to be proved beyond a

21

reasonable doubt, and it has to go to the jury.

23

those requirements do not apply.

Alderson Reporting Company

were saying that there isn't a simple distinction on your

theory between facts added by a legislature and facts

required by this Court.

4

isn't such a distinction as -- as you're arguing it now.

5

So, tell me -- tell me why there

MS. NAPOLITANO:

What we're arguing, Your Honor,

6

is that when a fact is found purely for the purpose of

7

sentencing -- and -- and recognize the fact here murder

8

for pecuniary gain was never a part of the definition of

9

first degree murder.

First degree murder is the

10

intentional killing of another or a felony murder with

11

certain underlying felony predicates.

12

the actual indictment.

It was charged here.

QUESTION:

15

MS. NAPOLITANO:

16
17

The jury found that

There was a death notice in

Right.
The jury was death qualified.

So, there's no question of surprise here.
QUESTION:

Well, are you -- are you saying then

18

that if a legislature adds a fact -- call it an element if

19

you want -- purely for purposes of determining the

20

sentence, that that too would be exempt from the -- the

21

guarantee of the jury trial?

22
23
24
25

MS. NAPOLITANO:

I think it could be exempt

depending on the circumstances, yes, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But would it be -- I mean, is that

the theory that you're arguing?

MS. NAPOLITANO:

Yes that there are --

I just want to know what you're --

you're arguing.
MS. NAPOLITANO:

Yes, Your Honor.

I'm sorry.

5

That there are some facts that the legislature is entitled

6

to find which don't go to the definition of the crime but

7

go to the punishment.

8

there's a Sixth Amendment right to jury sentencing.

9

QUESTION:

And this Court has never held that

What -- what do you do with the

10

broader principle which we express from time to time that

11

the -- the ultimate point of the jury right in -- in a

12

criminal case is to -- is to place the jury between the

15

the defendant and the State.

16

MS. NAPOLITANO:

circumstance.

22

kinds of non-death cases, you may have to do a different

kind of analysis.

24
25

So, you don't have the kind of broad ranging

That's why I say you -- you -- in those

But in the unique context of the death penalty
world where you have to have either a first degree murder
29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

or a felony murder -- and if it's a felony murder and you

2

have a non-shooter, you have to make the Enmund/Tison

3

finding, and that has to be made and can be made by the

4

judge -- there -- the legislature is not -- they're not

5

charging the death penalty for jaywalking.

6

And then the question is, all right, is the

7

legislature entitled under the Eighth Amendment or does

8

the legislature under the Eighth Amendment have to channel

9

discretion?

10

And they do.

And then the question is, does Apprendi somehow

11

require that that Eighth Amendment jurisprudence be

12

converted into a jury right on this -- on the aggravating

13

factors?

14

no, starting with Proffitt v. Florida all the way through

15

Walton.

16

And as this Court has said time and time again,

Poland v. Arizona is a great example where -QUESTION:

But -- but your -- your principle, in

17

fact, is broader than that because, as I understand it,

18

your principle is that what we have traditionally referred

19

to as sentencing factors -- maybe change that to a neutral

20

term, facts that bear solely on sentencing -- they can be

21

excluded from the -- the jury finding guarantee.

22

MS. NAPOLITANO:

Yes.

In the unique context of

23

the death penalty and then it remains for this Court to

24

decide whether you want to broaden it.

25

proposed by the petitioner here would be equally broad

But the rule

30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

taken out of the death penalty context because you could

2

have no fact that enhanced a sentence that didn't first

3

have to be found by a jury.

4

And in response to a question that was posed

5

earlier, that would throw into question the Federal

6

Sentencing Guidelines and their structure and -- any many

7

State sentencing structures where, once you are convicted

8

of a particular offense, the State law requires the judge

9

to give you a presumptive sentence unless he finds

10

additional facts, in which case he can depart upwards.

11

It's not just the Federal Sentencing Guidelines that use

12

that structure.

13

you are to hold that an aggravating factor even in a death

14

penalty case has to go to the jury, it is hard to imagine

15

why that wouldn't extend throughout the sentencing systems

16

of the States.

17

Many States use that structure.

QUESTION:

So, if

General Napolitano, how many death

18

sentence case are there presently in Arizona that would be

19

affected by a reversal here?

20

MS. NAPOLITANO:

We've had 89 death sentences

21

imposed since Walton, and approximately 30 are in some

22

type of direct review.

23

that's just in -- in Arizona.

24

1

Apprendi or feel it's quite limited.

2

What about the other cases I mentioned where

3

Powell and -- and Stewart -- Stevens all thought that a

4

jury should make this determination as part of the Eighth

5

Amendment jurisprudence because it's very important that

6

the death penalty be applied only where opinion in that

7

community believes that it is consistent with the cruel

8

and unusual punishment prohibition?

9

MS. NAPOLITANO:

Two responses to that, Your

10

Honor.

11

that they thought judicial sentencing may, in fact, be a

12

better way to guarantee against the arbitrary imposition

13

of the death penalty.

14
15

One is this Court itself in a later case mentioned

QUESTION:

The statistics seem to suggest that

16

MS. NAPOLITANO:

QUESTION:

General Napolitano, the -- the

And let me, if I might, go to the stare decisis

part of my argument, because it's not just the cases you

what it is, and the judge still has to go through all of

a narrowing process where the judge's discretion is

the issue of the fact that he was convicted of armed

QUESTION:

May I ask if you disagree with your

opponent's analysis of the pecuniary circumstance issue?

6

He says that there's a difference between armed robbery on

with that?

QUESTION:

Would you tell me how one would

hard to imagine how you then would not also have to

overrule Clemons, Hildwin, Poland, all the cases we've

that, of course, it's different.

So, the obvious argument is that if you're going to insist

that a jury find a fact that could enhance a sentence from

That doesn't really answer the

This is all a

And

And remember, in this case, you know, if you

21

just took the -- the literal language of Apprendi and --

22

and didn't go beneath it, and you took the literal

language of the Arizona first degree murder statute, the

24

maximum penalty under the statute is death, and the judge

25

is simply making a choice between life or death.
44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

And the

procedure that this Court has embraced, upheld, and

specifically said does not violate the Sixth Amendment.

11

that have made a difference?

MS. NAPOLITANO:

13

analysis that Apprendi suggests, part of that analysis is

14

you have to look at each statute and how it was

constructed and so forth.

automatically it would apply because, again, as I've made

the argument today, the Eighth Amendment death penalty

18

cases just are different.

19

I don't know whether

But, again, if you overrule Walton, it -- it is

20

hard to imagine how any judge would have the authority

21

under the Sixth Amendment to find any kind of fact that

would be used to enhance a sentence.

23

Apprendi is supposed to mean, that's a very, very broad

24

ruling.

And if that's what

verdict.

MS. NAPOLITANO:

Well, or enhance a sentence

5

difference between a sentence authorized and a presumptive

6

sentence set forth in either guidelines or in legislation?

7

We're cutting very fine hairs here.

And I think the ultimate question is, what is

QUESTION:

Mr. Hurwitz, would you address the

question that General Napolitano made about this is an

MR. HURWITZ:

I -- I will, Justice Ginsburg.

It

seems to me that the State's position is that when a fact

in order to impose the maximum punishment allowed by law,

that fact gets Sixth Amendment protection.

But when a

2

circumstance where the enhanced sentence may be from 10

3

years to 12 years.

4

It may well be true that this Court's Eighth

5

Amendment jurisprudence is unique, but in the context of

6

the Sixth Amendment, in the context of the facts necessary

7

and specified by State law, in order to allow the maximum

8

punishment allowed by law, there should not be an Eighth

9

Amendment exception.

10

The State has chosen to make specific facts

11

necessary for the imposition of the ultimate sentence, and

12

when the State chooses to do so, whether it chooses to do

13

so because it merely thinks it's a good idea or it chooses

14

to do so because the Constitution of the United States

15

requires it to do so, the same Sixth Amendment principle

narrowing, the State's choosing of factors and putting

his trial, Mr. Apprendi was told you're going to be tried

13

motivation and he's going to give you an additional

Apprendi was not about notice.

This case is, however about that central Sixth

Amendment point, and I would suggest to the Court that try

to have a different rule for capital punishment, you can't

distinguish the issues in this case and the underlying

Sixth Amendment principle from the principles in Apprendi.

And for that reason, we suggest that this case is

controlled by Apprendi and that the sentence of death
