ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

11

please the Court:

This is a case about the right to take

12

an appeal.

13

court confirmed a class action settlement that

14

substantially reduces Petitioner's individual pension.

15

The Fourth Circuit held that Petitioner nonetheless may

16

not appeal to argue that the district court abused its

17

discretion in rejecting his objections.

18

submission is that, as Justice Kennedy explained in oral

19

argument in the Felzen case, Rule 23 class members such as

20

Petitioner are bound by the district court's judgment and

21

thus are parties to that judgment with the right to appeal

22

from it.

23

opposite side of the table, actually agrees with us that

24

class members are bound by the judgment, that objector

25

appeals identify important legal errors, and that they

Over Petitioner's objections, the district

Our principal

Because the Government, although seated at the

1

also deter collusive settlements, I will leave to the

2

Solicitor General's representative any arguments to the

3

contrary that my friend Mr. Gold may make.

4

QUESTION:

Can I test your thesis that u are

5

bound by a judgment, you are a party to it? I mean, there

6

are cases where someone who has allied with a party and

7

has used the same attorney and has maybe had some input

8

into trial strategy, that that person will be bound by the

9

judgment, but as far as I know, we have never allowed, no

10

court that I know of has ever allowed such a person to

11

take an appeal on the ground that well, since you would

12

have been bound, you are a party.

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Scalia, I think it

14

depends on what we mean by bound.

15

more expansive notions of collateral estoppel and res

16

judicata.

17

judgment operates directly upon the class member.

18

me be clear that our position is not to move beyond that.

19

Our position is not that it's sufficient to be a party,

20

but that it is a necessary condition.

21

necessary, and this is an important point for the

22

distinction between appealing from an approved settlement

23

and for appealing a litigated judgment.

24
25

There are different,

What I'm talking about here is that the

QUESTION:

And let

It is also

You say that the judgment operates

directly upon the class member, as if we are talking about

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

some sort of physical thing, but how is that operation on

2

the class member different from, say, what might be res

3

judicata or collateral estoppel in some other case?

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, the

5

difference is that while you can have an application of

6

collateral estoppel or res judicata that extinguishes a

7

right to pursue an action, what I'm talking about here and

8

let me put it in very practical terms.

9

a pension and that pension went down 40 percent when the

The Petitioner had

10

district court in this case approved a settlement that

11

said the COLA provisions of the pension plan are null and

12

void, and that's the kind of direct operation I'm talking

13

about.

14

Now, there is an unsettled area of the law

15

stretching to precedents dating from the 1850s, the

16

so-called quasi-party cases.

17

necessary to apply those here because unlike a Rule 23.1

18

class member in the context of a derivative action, we are

19

directly bound by the action.

20

extinguishing a right of ours, for example, to sue on

21

behalf of a corporation.

22

QUESTION:

We don't think it's

We are not talking about

You are bound because a judge

23

determined that you had an adequate representative.

I

24

agree with you that every person in that class is equally

25

affected and indeed there is no opt out of this class that

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

we are dealing with.

But the determination has been made

2

that you are represented by someone who is an adequate

3

representative of all members of the class who will fairly

4

and adequately represent the class.

5

representative will fairly and adequately represent the

6

class, why isn't it the end of it?

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

So as long as the

Well, that's a good entry into

8

the purpose and function of Rule 23(e).

What happens is

9

that at the point that it's acknowledged by the

10

Respondents here that at the point settlement is agreed

11

to, the class representative and be opposing named parties

12

joined forces to oppose objections, and that continued at

13

the stage of the case where you have to decide whether or

14

not to take an appeal.

15

and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall

be given to all members of the class in such manner as the

court directs.

9

rule doesn't actually explicitly provide for objections.

10

The advisory committee notes make clear that that was the

11

intent of this provision, and in fact amended Rule 23(e)

12

which will go into effect next year explicitly provides

13

for the right to state objections.

Our point is that nothing in these rules

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

extinguished at the district court, that someone uniquely

2

in the context of a class action, who is bound directly by

3

the judgment and participates as of right in the district

4

court, would only participate at the district court.

5

QUESTION:

But do you agree that you must

6

intervene in the district court, or do you say you don't

7

even do that?

8
9
10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, we say we do

not have to do that, that there is nothing about this
Court's precedents --

11

QUESTION:

Why not? That is, if this is open

12

under the language, it seems to me there is no real

13

difference between the parties as a practical matter,

14

except you want to say the person all the time, no matter

15

what, can bring an appeal, and they want to say what you

16

should do is intervene and that gives the district judge a

17

chance to act in an unusual situation as a kind of

18

safeguard to make sure that it is fair.

19

I mean, this person could be anybody under the

20

sun.

It could muck up the litigation for everybody else.

21

The extra time involved might be important, and it might

22

be totally unfair, given the prior history, to allow this

23

individual to bring the appeal.

24

that the judge should have a chance as a gatekeeper to

25

make that determination.

So all they are saying is

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Now why not, if it's open under the language,

2

say there is a little more conservative position, gives us

3

a chance to not get things mixed up?

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, let me, there are two

5

parts to the question.

The first is, is it open under the

6

rules and second, why wouldn't it be a good idea to adopt

7

it if it were? As to the first, it is not open under the

8

rules, and let me take you again to the particular rule in

9

question.

That would be, it's suggested, rule 23(d)(2),

10

and this rule says that the district court may in

11

appropriate circumstances --

12
13

QUESTION:

Where are you reading, where are you

reading from?

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I'm going to read from (a)(3) in

15

the carryover to (a)(4) of the same appendix of the

16

Council --

17

QUESTION:

And where are you starting on (a)(3)?

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

At the bottom of the page D,

19

orders and conduct of actions.

Your Honors, it says in

20

the conduct of actions to which this rule applies, the

21

court may make appropriate orders and then I'm going to

22

jump to 2.

23

requiring for the protection of the members of a class or

24

otherwise for fair conduct of the action that notice be

25

given.

This is the suggestion of the other side:

So there is a suggestion, where it follows, notice

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

be given, and then there is a class that says -- I'll just

2

continue to read it:

3

In such matters the court may direct to some or

4

all members, of any step in the action or of the proposed

5

extent of the judgment, or of -- and this becomes critical

6

-- the opportunity of members to signify whether they

7

consider the representation fair and adequate.

8

the clause:

9

or otherwise come into the action.

10

And then

to intervene and present claims or defenses

Our point is as follows, or is several fold.

11

The first is that this is a different notice from the

12

23(e) notice.

13

can employ in some cases, and I think it deserves to be

14

emphasized that in the 35 years since 1966, not a single

15

court has read this provision in the way that's suggested

16

by the other side, that it's mandatory that there be an

17

intervention for a screening function.

18

reason is that this (d)(2) notice refers to intervening to

19

present claims or defenses, and that the not what an

20

objector seeks to do.

21

This is a discretionary notice that courts

The particular

An objector says there is a settlement on the

22

table, I have a legal objection to it, it's either

23

unlawful, as in Amchem, or it's unfair as in this case,

24

and so it's a different kind of intervention.

25

think it's open and no court has ever suggested that it's

So I don't

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

how the rule should be interpreted.

2

disagrees with me, Justice Breyer, why isn't it a good

3

idea? It doesn't accomplish anything.

4

What happens is this.

Now, assume the Court

You move to intervene,

5

the intervention motion is denied, so you appeal that, so

6

you haven't really gained anything.

7

turn the objection into the application of the abuse of

8

discretion standard.

9

of it because then the court of appeals has to decide

What you have done is

You just added another layer on top

10

well, did the judge get the intervention motion wrong? If

11

that was an abuse of discretion, then we'll reach the

12

merits.

13
14

QUESTION:

What if the court grants your motion

to intervene?

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, then you

16

haven't accomplished anything either.

17

is permitted an appeal that under our theory would be

18

permitted anyway.

19

QUESTION:

All you have done

Could we, could we go back just one

20

step.

You don't have to intervene to be an objector.

21

That's very clear, isn't it?

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

23

QUESTION:

Yes.

And I thought that your basic

24

argument was whatever your status is in the district

25

court, that's what your status is on appeal.

If you can

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

go into a district court, which is extraordinary, usually

2

the district court doesn't let anybody come in without

3

having intervened, but to object to a settlement, you

4

don't have to do anything except say judge, I'm an

5

objector.

6

thought that your basic argument was whatever status you

7

have in the district court, that you can come in and

8

object, then you have that same status on appeal.

9

You don't have to be an intervenor.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

And I

I had taken an implicit

10

premise to Justice Breyer's question that I'll come back

11

to.

12

Ginsburg.

13

We moved to intervene.

14

is perfectly clear that if that intervention is properly

15

denied, and as to our attempt to come in and take

16

discovery, disqualify class counsel, that's not within the

17

question presented.

18

not have that power as an objector.

This case will illustrate your point, Justice
In this case, we objected to the settlement.
That intervention was denied.

It

It's not here at the court. We would

19

As an objector, we have only the right to pursue

20

our individual objections, which is the distinction I take

21

it you are drawing.

22

premise of his question to be well, why don't we intervene

23

for that limited purpose? And that's I think what I took

24

Justice Breyer to be getting at.

25

big deal.

Justice Breyer, I took the implicit

He is saying what's the

Can't the district judge maybe help us out in

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

some cases where we might have a lot of different

2

objectors and give you a limited intervention right.

3

is akin to the rule that is applied by the Seventh

4

Circuit, and that is preserved by the question presented

5

within the petition.

6

That

Now, the Government adds a patina on top of that

7

that Justice Breyer referred to, and that is don't merely

8

have pro forma intervention, but allow the district judge

9

to actually do something and screen out the people we

10

don't want appealing.

11

and I said I don't think it will actually --

12

QUESTION:

So I came back to Justice Breyer

You have gained something.

I mean,

13

normally the judge would grant it, but let's say he

14

didn't.

15

would be very unfair, etcetera and you say well, he will

16

just appeal that.

17

different matter as an appellate court to decide whether

18

the judge abused his discretion there than to have to go

19

through what could be 15 years' worth of litigation to

20

figure out whether this settlement nor the circumstances

21

is a fair one.

22

It would be some pretty good reason.

That's true.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Maybe it

But it's quite a

Justice Breyer, let me draw a

23

distinction.

My point is not that in an extraordinary

24

case, that a district judge is faced with dozens upon

25

dozens of objectors; the case has become completely

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

unmanageable; this is an important settlement to implement

2

immediately; that a district court couldn't in that case

3

exercise discretion under the broad language of subsection

4

23(d).

5

in every case, we don't need to be doing this.

6

My point is that in the mine run of class actions,

QUESTION:

Well, what discretion would the

7

district court have if your theory is right, Mr.

8

Goldstein, that an objector doesn't even have to

9

intervene? I mean, in a very complicated case the objector

10

simply says I object, I'm not a party.

11

district court judge do?

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

13

What can the

Well, I believe that under the

language of the rule --

14

QUESTION:

Of what rule?

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Of subsection D, and let me

16

return to the introductory clause, Mr. Chief Justice.

17

There is a, sort of the broad phrasing because we have all

18

kinds of class actions.

19

don't have opt outs here but in D 3 cases we might.

20

in the broad phrasing in the conduct of actions to which

21

the rule applies, the court may make appropriate orders.

22

And I think the court of appeals would be very sympathetic

23

to a district judge faced with an extraordinary

24

circumstance of lots of adverse objectors. But I think --

25

QUESTION:

Justice Ginsburg pointed out we
Just

So you are saying that I am reaching

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

out and bringing you into the case in spite of the fact

2

you haven't moved to intervene?

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I apologize, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

No.

What I'm reacting to is Justice Breyer's suggestion

5

that if there are actually a lot of objectors in the case,

6

and it's become a mess, we have a district judge who says

7

look, what in the world is going to happen with this case

8

on appeal.

9

out.

I'm going to try and help the court of appeals

My point is that I do believe that the district

10

judge in that circumstance would have the discretion to

11

say to the intervenors -- excuse me, the objectors, say to

12

the objectors, look, if you all are going to take an

13

appeal, we are going to have to handle this here and try

14

and create some organization.

15

QUESTION:

How does he give jurisdiction over

16

people that are simply on the outside; they are not

17

parties; all they are doing is objecting?

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I apologize, Mr. Chief Justice.

19

They are parties.

20

Sosna vs. Iowa.

21

have come, they are both bound by the judgment and they

22

have availed themselves of the court by appearing and

23

making an objection.

24
25

This is a rule 23 class action under

At the point of class certification, they

QUESTION:
you.

Okay.

Let's assume we agree with

What does the judge then do? Does he say I'm going

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to let X and Y speak for the rest of you, and I will not

2

hear separate objections from the others?

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, no.

I think the judge

4

clearly is going to hear objections from everyone.

5

question is is the district judge going to exercise some

6

gatekeeping determination about who goes up on appeal.

7

But Justice Souter, I could not agree more.

8
9

QUESTION:

How -- how can -- I'm lost.

The

How does

he exercise gatekeeping on who appeals?

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Souter, that is our

11

fundamental point, is that, let me just distinguish again

12

with the Court whose position is what.

13

with this suggestion.

14

it's entirely unnecessary. I'm trying to achieve --

15

QUESTION:

We don't agree

It wasn't employed here.

We think

No, but you are suggesting it as an

16

alternative to Justice Breyer's suggestion that maybe to

17

avoid chaos, you ought to have discretionary intervention,

18

permissive intervention, and if you've got to avoid the

19

chaos, then I assume the judge has got to be able in

20

effect to limit what some parties objecting can do in

21

favor of what other parties, letting other parties

22

objecting speak.

23

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Souter, I agree with

24

you.

I don't know exactly how this is supposed to work.

25

It has never come up in 35 years since the rule was

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

amended fundamentally in 1966.

So far as we can tell,

2

neither a federal district judge for a state trial court

3

decided that he or she was presented with such an

4

extraordinary case.

5

QUESTION:

I don't endorse this proposal -Mr. Goldstein, I was very surprised

6

to hear you say you agree with Justice Souter when he used

7

on the specific problem that you identified and that is

the district judge picking out one appellant versus

another.

dismisses their appeal? This is an entirely untested rule.

And no matter how complicated the

case in the district court, they don't have to intervene.

14

You are going to have 15 or 20 appeals.

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

But it has never happened.

The

language that is quoted against us from another court of

QUESTION:

Will your rule hold for certiorari

5

takes an appeal, but then the class petitions for

6

certiorari, that any non-named class member can petition

7

for certiorari?

8
9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, Justice Kennedy.

This

court's rule as I understand it is that you had to have

10

been a party in the court of appeal, and so the failure to

11

pursue your individual objection in the court of appeals

12

would require, would mean that you drop out.

13
14

QUESTION:

Well, but your rule is that you are a

party.

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

You are a party to the case, to

16

the district court's judgment.

17

Court's cert proceedings turn on not whether you are a

18

party in the district court but whether you are a party in

19

the court of appeals, and I can --

20

QUESTION:

That's correct.

But this

But under your philosophy you are a

21

party to the court of appeals because you are bound by the

22

judgment.

23

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, Justice Kennedy.

Our point

24

is this.

When you appeal as an objector, as opposed to

25

the class representative, you appeal in your individual

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

capacity to pursue your individual objections.

That is

2

our position why the Fourth Circuit had it wrong in saying

3

that we were going to take over the case, usurp the role

4

of the class representative.

That's not correct.

5

We come into the court of appeals, Mr. Devlin

6

does, on behalf of himself and when his, he is the only

7

objector appellant that was in the court.

8

he represents an organization, but his individual

9

objections are the only ones that are in the court of

11

It is true that

appeals.
QUESTION:

What you are saying then is not that

12

he ceases to be a party, that the nonobjecting class

13

member ceases to be a party in the court of appeals, but

14

the nonobjecting class member has waived the right to be

15

separately represented by himself, isn't it?

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

18

QUESTION:

And the objection, of course he

19

couldn't petition for cert because all he can do, he can't

20

question anything else in the case except his objections

21

to the settlement.

22

That's all he can pursue.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's right.

That's what rule

23

23 sets up.

It gives him a formal and important role in

24

the process.

25

reason that exists, and that is that the Rules Advisory

And it's important not to let go of the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Committee notes that, and, understood that these

2

objections are an important part of the process of

3

identifying legal errors as in Amchem; deterring collusive

4

settlements is another important role that they further.

5

Let me identify an additional difficulty and a

6

reason why you should not have an intervention rule, and

7

it applies, I'm trying to advise the court about rules

8

that intersect its decision and rules that are going to

9

come into place in 2003.

In 2003, assuming the rules as

10

proposed to be amended are actually implemented, there is

11

going to be a real problem with the Respondent's

12

suggestion and opt-outs.

13

action, we don't have the right to opt out, which I think

14

is a point in our favor, as Justice Ginsburg noted, but in

15

a (b)(3) class action you can opt out at the point of

16

class certification.

17

Right now, in a (b)(3) class

Under the amended rule, there is going to be a

18

second opt-out opportunity at the point of settlement.

19

Our concern is that if you tell an objector, your role in

20

the case may be cut off, if the district judge makes a

21

terrible legal error, and the district judge then is a

22

screen and gets to decide whether or not you are going to

23

get to appeal, all that person is going to do is get out

24

of the case and go litigate on their own by opting out.

25

The one thing this Court I would hope doesn't

23

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

want is to spread out all the parties.

2

is to keep everybody within the individual judgment.

3

premise of the Respondent's position, it seems to me, is

4

fundamentally that we want a class action to be settled

5

and over with, just the way a lawsuit of me against

6

another person would be over.

9

10

We, this is a case involving hundreds upon hundreds

can't just be settled by one person or another.

11

QUESTION:

Well, what's wrong with the

12

Government's position, which is you have the right to

13

intervene for purposes of appeal? Indeed you don't even

14

have to file your motion to intervene until after the

15

settlement has been entered as a judgment of the court.

16

Just to make it clear that you are not someone who isn't

17

even a part of this class, isn't even legitimately part of

18

this class, you are not just somebody that walked in off

19

the street.

20

Why isn't that a problem?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Because the judge already knows

21

that.

The only people contemplated by the Government's

22

intervention proposal and screening function are those who

23

have already stated objections at the fairness hearing,

24

and we know who those people are.

25

of the class and they weren't proper appellants, we would

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

argue no.

2

My point about all the different hypotheticals

3

spun in a couple of pages in the government's brief where

4

it discusses the screening function is that it doesn't

5

actually add value and it does create collateral

6

litigation.

7

will be mandatory disclosures; there will be the

8

opposition to the motion to intervene; it will be

9

litigated and then it will appeal.

10

There will be a motion to intervene; there

I could see, if the courts of appeals were

11

actually experiencing a problem, that the advisory

12

committee would revisit this issue and would interpose the

13

district judges as a screen, but that hasn't happened.

14
15

QUESTION:

The advisory committee could solve

this either way, couldn't they, the Rules Committee?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It actually could.

cycles, of course, it revisits particular rules.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE S. GOLD

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

8
9

Mr. Gold,

MR. GOLD:
the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

The well settled rule that we begin from and

10

that the Petitioners accept is that only parties to a

11

lawsuit or those that properly become parties may appeal

12

an adverse judgment.

13

the point from which everything else springs, is that the

14

unnamed class members are parties to a class action suit.

15

That premise is wrong.

16

litigating persons before the court are the persons who

17

initiate and prosecute the case as parties opposing the

18

class, the persons who are served with process and defend

19

the lawsuit as representative parties, and the persons who

20

move to intervene and are granted intervention.

21

point of the class action is to provide for representative

22

party suits where the class is so numerous that joinder of

23

all the unnamed class members is impractical.

24
25

QUESTION:

The basic point of the Petitioners,

In a rule 23 case, the only

and at that point, when I object to the deal, I'm not

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, may I go back to the

14

statement, you said something, you moved to intervene.

If

15

you have seen class actions in the Seventh Circuit and the

16

Third Circuit, you can come in and object without

17

intervening.

18

MR. GOLD:

But that wasn't --

19

QUESTION:

And that, you come in and object and

20

21

is not adequate to represent me to the extent of the

22

settlement.

MR. GOLD:

This representative

Well, but you are not saying that the

24

representative is not adequate to represent you for

25

purposes of the settlement.

Your objection is that the

settlement is not fair, proper and adequate.
QUESTION:

Well, then let me put it in your

3

terms, and I'm reading from page 30 of your brief.

Once a

4

proposed settlement is reached, it is axiomatic that the

5

named representative party who has negotiated the

6

settlement does not adequately represent either the

7

interests or the viewpoint of those class members opposed

8

to the settlement.

9

saying well, you said yourself it's axiomatic that they,

You say it's axiomatic and I was just

10

the representative at that point does not adequately

11

represent the class member who is opposed to the

12

settlement.

13

MR. GOLD:

In -- in the sense, Your Honor, what

14

we are saying is not that the class representative in fact

15

has not properly and adequately represented the class.

16

is that the individual can, has a proper argument for

17

intervention on that theory.

18

individual in making objections is necessarily challenging

19

the propriety and adequacy of representation.

20

QUESTION:

It

It isn't that the, the

But Mr. Gold, if he is challenging

21

the representative's fee, I think he is, which often is

22

what the minority member of the class objects to, the

23

large fee that the class representatives, the lawyers get.

24

You can't say there is not a conflict there.

25

MR. GOLD:

I'm not arguing that there is not a

"difference of opinion" or conflict.

2

QUESTION:

If --

Well, you are certainly not arguing

3

that the lawyer adequately represents the person who is

4

objecting to his fee either, are you?

5

MR. GOLD:

No.

I am not.

No.

But I am arguing

that the making of objections, whether it is by a class

7

member or the, a nonclass member who is interested and

affected by the class action and the class action

14

That is, as a party.

QUESTION:

That is the very point of the

That was somebody who was not a

member of the class, right?

15

MR. GOLD:

That is correct.

16

QUESTION:

Here you are talking about members of

17

the class and even in this case, people who are made to be

18

members of the class even if they don't want to be because

19

they can't opt out.

20

MR. GOLD:

Well, they are the members of the

21

class but they are not parties to the lawsuit.

22

the whole --

23

QUESTION:

They don't want to be.

That is

All they want

24

to do is to say, as Justice Stevens suggests, you made the

2

say that?

3

MR. GOLD:

There is no argument here that you

made a deal and the lawyers are getting the lion's share.

5

Here the lawyers were paid on --

But we're are not dealing with the

merits of it.

We are dealing with first you have a right

to come in and object, and you have agreed that you do

have a right to come in and object.

Now, the question is,

10

what more? And what I took to be the principal difference

11

between your position and the Government's is the

12

Government is very clear that there is a right to

13

intervene.

14

for the limited purpose of pursuing the appeal.

15

The objector would have a right to intervene

You seem to hedge on it.

MR. GOLD:

The Government says of course they have a right to

What is your view?

I don't understand the Government to

argue that the motion must be granted, and I'll -QUESTION:

Do you understand the Government to

say it is intervention of right, not permissive

MR. GOLD:

It's intervention of, of right, but

2

not automatic.

3

that has to be granted without a showing.

4

right is intervention of, to file, to participate in the

5

litigation by doing something.

6

since we are talking about a status to take an appeal in a

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, Mr. Gold, I

13

really don't understand what you are trying to convey

14

because there are two kinds of intervention, intervention

15

of right and permissive intervention.

16

right if you meet the terms, and in this case it would be

17

when you claim an interest, which is the subject matter of

18

the action, and you're so situated that the disposition of

the action may as a practical matter impaired your ability

20

to protect your own interests.

No.

Maybe you

The objections can be of all

shapes and sizes, Justice Stevens.

14

settlement doesn't provide enough for the X or Y class and

They can be that the

The judge's role is, is the settlement fair,

proper and adequate? And the point is, our basic point is

19

if a class member wishes to go further and take the case

to another stage where he is litigating on behalf of the

21

class, he ought to be an intervenor and a party, not

22

simply someone who is not a party.

proper, whatever the right standard on intervention is,

24

and we believe that the standard I have articulated makes

25

sense in the class action.

We think that that's

QUESTION:

You disagree with anything the

2

government said in its brief about the objector has a

3

right to intervene, he can do so even after judgment

4

within the time allowed?

5

MR. GOLD:

We think definitely that an objector

6

or even a class member who hasn't participated in the

7

objection process can intervene to take an appeal and to

8

forward the objections made in the objection process by

9

anyone, but we think that --

10

QUESTION:

Then you are disagreeing with the

11

Seventh Circuit.

12

says you have a right to intervene, but you must exercise

13

it when you know about the settlement, and it's too late

14

after judgment.

15

Seventh Circuit, as I understand it,

So you are disagreeing with that?

MR. GOLD:

Well, the Government -- neither, I

16

don't believe the Seventh Circuit has passed on the, the

17

propriety of intervention after judgment.

18

is --

MR. GOLD:

It has.

Our only point

It has. It --

-- that only parties can -- no, they

said that you can intervene after.
QUESTION:

No.

The Seventh Circuit has said; it

23

has dismissed.

It said you have a right to be here, but

24

you should have intervened when you knew that you were

25

objecting to the settlement.

It's too late to do so after

the judgment.
MR. GOLD:
that position.

Well, the Government doesn't take

We don't take that position.

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Gold.

Ms. Millett,

we'll hear from you.
MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

7

please the Court.

We agree with Petitioners that

8

objectors who have expressed objections to settlement

9

agreements have important interests and often should be

10

allowed to appeal.

11

by which someone gets to the court of appeals.

12

QUESTION:

Our disagreement is on the mechanism

Is that a purely formal disagreement,

13

or are there some distinct practical advantages that you

14

can tell us to your rule so that the district judge, I

15

assume, can give some shape and direction to the appeal?

16

Is that the point?

17

MS. MILLETT:

There is a practical significance

18

to this process.

I think it's important to keep in mind

19

that class actions can come in many forms and shapes and

20

can involve up to, as this Court knows from the asbestos

21

cases, tens of thousands of people, any one of whom can

22

express an objection.

23

disagree with the argument that you will know at the

24

objection stage whether in fact that person even really is

25

a member of the class action, who has a live claim that is

And it is actually incorrect and we

1

covered by the class.

2

process allows is, we don't think a merits determination

3

on the value of the objection, but we think it allows a

4

district court in the first instance to make a record and

5

address whether someone is a member of the class.

6

So what the intervention motion

I mean, you could have a class action that's not

7

as discrete as this one here, but the definition of the

8

class is everyone employed by X corporation for a period

9

of 10 years.

10

QUESTION:

Beyond the determination that they

11

are members of the class, are there any further purposes

12

served by the intervention rule you propose?

13

MS. MILLETT:

Whether or not there is stale

14

claim.

15

simply don't have any relevance to the issue that will be

16

presented on appeal.

17

as Mr. Gold said, objections come in many shapes and

18

sizes.

19

page 125, we have an objection that says please consider

20

this letter my objection.

21

elucidation to anyone on the basis for appeal.

22

the court can deal with this, this deprives the district

23

court of any opportunity to address this concern as a part

24

of the settlement.

25

But it, you could have objections that really

For example, in this case, I think

And if I could refer the Court to Joint Appendix

QUESTION:

That's it.

It gives no
Now, how

You think under Petitioner's view

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

that person would be able to appeal?
MS. MILLETT:

That's my understanding of

3

Petitioner's view, without having given the district court

4

any opportunity, or the attorneys who are representing

5

that person at that point, to address this concern is part

6

of the fairness hearing.

7

QUESTION:

Well, what is the practical

8

difference? I mean, you take the position that

9

intervention is of right, is that correct?

10

MS. MILLETT:

11

QUESTION:

Yes.

All right.

Then the practical

12

difference is that if they move to intervene, they simply

13

have to come physically before the court, so the court can

14

flush out the objection, as opposed to merely filing an

15

objection saying I object in which case the court may not

16

see them? Is that the difference?

17

MS. MILLETT:

They don't have to be there

18

physically, in person, but there is motions practice in

19

district courts, and a district court would decide whether

20

or not they want someone there in person or not.

21

intervention rights --

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

But

Well, why cannot the same thing be

accomplished by saying flush out your objection?
MS. MILLETT:

There is two answers to that.

First of all, intervention of right doesn't mean the

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

district court doesn't have some final say.

2

need to understand, objections are coming before a

3

settlement has been approved, and it may well be even if

4

this objection is very vague, I have got enough other

5

objections that in fact would capture what that person is

6

concerned about without them having told me.

7

object -- the objection process, the fairness hearing is

8

very flexible and informal at this point and allows the

9

district court to gather information and make a decision

10

But when we

And if they

whether to approve the settlement agreement.

11

It would be very unworkable, and I think unwise

12

to adopt a rule that turns the fairness hearing, which is

13

supposed to focus on the settlement agreement and dealing

14

with serious objections, I think that's what courts want

15

to do, into a fairness hearing/qualifications for appeal,

16

where I have got to spend all my time not just deciding

17

whether I should approve this settlement agreement or not,

18

so that you would even be aggrieved, but in advance I have

19

to decide whether you are part of the class and someone

20

who could --

21

QUESTION:

Ms. Millett, I would be very

22

impressed with the argument you are making now about

23

having the thing run neat and tidy, but for two things.

24

Are you aware of any experience in the Second or Third

25

Circuit that creates these, this pandemonium that you are

39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

now describing? And second, when did the Government find

2

out about the pandemonium? Because in Felzen, as I recall,

3

you took the position that the objector can come in,

4

object to the settlement, and can appeal for the limited

5

purpose of challenging the settlement without intervening.

6

What happened between Felzen and this case, and are you

7

basing your prediction of pandemonium on any experience in

8

the Second and Third Circuit that allowed objectors to

9

appeal for years?

10

MS. MILLETT:

Concrete evidence of pandemonium,

11

no, there is no concrete evidence that intervention is a

12

difficult barrier in the five circuits that have required

13

-- in fact, the seven circuits that require this

14

intervention motion.

15

of the rules.

16

rules for dealing with deciding who will be a litigating

17

party, not one of the 10,000 on the sideline, but a

18

litigating party in a case.

19

So our position is based on analysis

We have an established mechanism in the

Now at the time of Felzen, we didn't have as

20

much experience with the limited intervention option for

21

purposes of appeal.

But in the intervening time,

40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there have been some decisions from the Seventh Circuit

2

that have propounded this notion, in particular, Seventh

3

Circuit, that have propounded, and the Eighth Circuit,

4

too, that have propounded this notion of limited

5

intervention for purposes of appeal.

6

have also just reviewed and reconsidered our position, and

7

looking at the text of the rules, we have an answer to

8

this problem.

QUESTION:

10

And I have to say we

MS. MILLETT:

I'm sorry.

I was --

But the point is that

11

we have an answer, our position is that there is an answer

12

in the rules to this problem and it's limited intervention

13

for purposes of appeal.

14

an ad hoc rule cut out of out of whole cloth.

15

to collect a variety of factors that happen to have been

16

present in this case --

17

QUESTION:

And the alternative is to make up
That seems

May I ask you, because your time is

18

so limited, could you tell us what is the difference

19

between your view of this case and Mr. Gold's view of this

20

case?

21

MS. MILLETT:

I think, well, putting aside, we

22

think there is more, we don't think that the objectors are

23

parties but we are somewhat more sympathetic to the notion

24

that they have the same interests as quasi parties, I

25

think, than Mr. Gold is.

Secondly, and I don't want to

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

put words in his mouth, but my understanding of their

2

brief and argument here is that they would have some more

3

rigid scrutiny of the intervention as a right motion, and

4

in fact would require the person to demonstrate that they

5

can represent the interests of the class.

6

QUESTION:

May I ask you under your view of the

7

requirement of an intervention for purposes of appeal,

8

could the district judge in this case, in response to the

9

intervention motion that was actually filed, have granted

10

that relief?

11
12

MS. MILLETT:

The intervention for purposes of

appeal?

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

14

MS. MILLETT:

Could it have, I guess the

15

district court would have had the power contingently to

16

reserve judgment.

17

before the settlement was even distributed and notice was

18

given, so it would have been odd to grant intervention for

19

a settlement judgment that had not yet been entered and

20

the judge hadn't heard objections or had a fairness

21

hearing.

22

judgment and I will renew or revisit this question for

23

limited purposes of appeal after I have judgment, if you

24

are still interested, if your concerns are not addressed.

25

Because, remember that motion was made

I mean district court can only say I'll reserve

In this case, the intervention was, again,

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

before the settlement was even distributed to members of

2

the class, and it was joined with a motion that asked to

3

strike class counsel for preliminary injunction.

4

think, and it hasn't been contested that the district

5

court was well within its discretion to deny.

6

QUESTION:

And so I

But you could deny it in court.

You

7

could say to the extent that they wanted to intervene to

8

contest the settlement, fine, to the extent that they want

9

to take discovery, it's not fine.

But to say that because

10

they asked for too much they are not entitled to anything,

11

is, I would think the Government would say the judge was

12

right to say they can't engage in discovery.

13

was right to say they are not entitled to an injunction.

14

But to say that they can't intervene --

15

MS. MILLETT:

The judge

The district court never said that

16

they can't intervene for purposes of appeal because they

17

were never --

18
19
20

QUESTION:

It denied the motion to intervene,

which had many parts.
MS. MILLETT:

Well, it just said to intervene.

21

The motion itself just says to intervene and then was

22

accompanied with this, other motions asking --

23

QUESTION:

So, should not the proper ruling have

24

been yes, you can intervene, but only for this limited

25

purpose, instead of saying motion denied?

43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. MILLETT:

Well, I think if this Court would

2

adopt the rule and recognize that limited intervention for

3

purposes of appeal is appropriate in this context,

4

district courts will know that that's an option and be

5

able to address it or raise it with attorneys.

6

important thing here is I think --

7

QUESTION:

But the

This district judge certainly thought

8

that his wording on the objection, he twice said if you

9

don't agree, appeal it.

10

And the "it" was his appeal of

the settlement.

11

MS. MILLETT:

He said that.

He also twice told

12

him that he wasn't a party to the case, as well.

13

-- the point is, you may have thought he would ask, but

14

our interest in this case is less the particular, we gave

15

the court our best judgment of how the record --

QUESTION:

I think

Do you disagree with the Seventh

MS. MILLETT:

If that's how one reads -- I

assume you are talking about the Navigant opinion?

QUESTION:

Yes.

MS. MILLETT:

I think there is a prior opinion

Easterbrook also wrote, which we think adopted our

position.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

8

If I could make four points, please, about the

9

Government's proposal starting with its applications to

10

this case, because Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg

11

wanted to know whether we do here, assuming what happened

12

in the district court, assuming we were going to adopt the

13

Government's position, the Government does not press, so

14

far as I understand, any further whether or not it's

15

presented in this court.

16

identifying the motion to intervene, the discussion of the

17

Seventh Circuit's position.

18

in the district court.

19

We have the cert petition

The question is what we did

The argument, as I understand it, the textual

20

basis for the Government's rule is that under subsection

21

(d)(2) of rule 23 you move to intervene, and the language

22

of the rule is that the district court can condition your

23

right to intervene.

24

And Justice Ginsburg, if you would adopt the

25

Government's suggestion, I think that's what you would

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

have to say was the appropriate result in this case, that

2

the district judge should have seen our intervention

3

motion and because he clearly did believe we had the right

4

to take an appeal, he should have conditioned it.

5
6

So my principal point is that whatever the Court
does in terms of its rule, we prevail.

I need to distinguish between intervention for all

purposes and intervention for purposes of taking an

appeal.

flags the fact that we move to intervene and discusses at

17

some length the Seventh Circuit's role which we are

discussing here both in the petition and in the required

brief, and to that extent it clearly --

There are, the cert petition, and

In the cert petition, the question presented

But that's not, I don't think a fair

21

interpretation of the question that you have presented.

22

The question is whether you have standing to appeal.

23

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Kennedy, the reason we

24

used that formulation is because it's the formulation that

25

the Fourth Circuit used. It's just picked up from the

court of --

2

QUESTION:

Well, we'll decide that another time.

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I understand.

The only other

4

point, I would make, Mr. Chief Justice, about what's

5

fairly included in the question presented is I ask the

6

court to look at the question as the Government frames it,

7

which it only could do if it believed our position was --

QUESTION:

Well, we take it the question you

presented and your petition for certiorari, that's what we
granted.

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

Now,

12

the second is, I'd like to address, Justice Ginsburg, with

13

respect, I don't think that you got a comforting answer on

14

the question of whether or not this has been a problem in

15

the Second or Third circuits, i.e., is there a problem out

16

there that requires the rules to be construed --

17

QUESTION:

Why is it, has there been a problem

18

the other way? The seventh circuits that have gone the

19

other way?

20

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

But they don't, Justice Breyer.

21

Our point is that no circuit applies the Government's

22

rule.

23

problem with their rule, since no court has ever adopted

24

or even suggested it.

25

It's a little unfair to say that I can't identify a

Now, it is a problem to the extent that there

47

are circuits that require full party intervention.

so much as that it cuts off appeals, appeals that are

perfectly legitimate.

our motion to intervene gives us a right to appeal.

10

persons who are directly affected by the judgment,

and then what they can do is they can appeal to the extent

17

is that in an appropriate case a district court could

employ the Government's suggestion, but why we would want

to add the burden of this intervention requirement in

every single class action in order to avoid the

hypothetical possibility, that again has never been

suggested by any court, State or Federal, so far as we or
