ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARLA J. STOVALL

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MS. STOVALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and

may it please the Court:

10

The Kansas Supreme Court has erroneously read

11

this Court's decision in Kansas v. Hendricks as requiring

12

a showing that a potentially sexually violent predator

13

cannot control his behavior and that such a requirement

14

has supplemented the two requisites for civil commitment

15

that this Court has approved in and since the Addington

16

case.

17

illness and dangerousness.

18

Those two requirements, as you know, are mental

The volitional impairment that the Kansas

19

Supreme Court has ruled was constitutionally required for

20

civil commitment ignores the fact that psychological

21

disorders, such as antisocial personality, can impair an

22

individual in behavior, cognitive, perceptual, emotional,

23

and even intellectual capacities.

24
25

This Court has never indicated that there's
anything constitutionally significant about a volitional

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

impairment.

2

QUESTION:

There was a good deal of reference in

3

our Hendricks opinion to the -- to the apparent fact that

4

the person there had what was volitionally impaired.

5

You're saying that was descriptive rather than essential

6

to the holding?

7

MS. STOVALL:

I'm saying it was descriptive.

8

Mr. Hendricks had apparently, and according to himself

9

only, an inability to control his own behavior.

So, when

10

the majority wrote about Mr. Hendricks, they used that

11

kind of a description.

12

QUESTION:

Well, but we also relied on prior

13

authority that made some reference to lack of control.

14

don't think that what was done by the court below was

15

totally off the wall in light of what was said in our

16

prior cases.

17

not to that extent?

18

I

What if there is some element but perhaps
How would you draw the line?

MS. STOVALL:

Well, if this Court says that

19

there needs to be some volitional impairment displayed, we

20

would suggest that it just be merely some impairment.

21

have a total impairment is something that the

22

psychiatrists will even tell us is an impossible standard

23

to show.

24
25

QUESTION:

To

You think that's the standard adopted

in the court below that we're reviewing?

1

MS. STOVALL:

2

QUESTION:

3

MS. STOVALL:

4

QUESTION:

I do.

Total impairment?
I do.

Do you acknowledge that lack of

5

ability to control one's unlawful conduct and volitional

6

impairment are one and the same thing?

7

MS. STOVALL:

8

QUESTION:

9

No, I do not.

Suppose I'm delusional and -- and I

think that -- that people I see are Satan.

I'm fully able

10

to control myself and -- and do not attack people who are

11

not Satan, but I think that some people are Satan.

12

MS. STOVALL:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Your Honor, that's --

Do you call that a lack of volitional

control or delusion?
MS. STOVALL:

I would consider that delusional

16

and not a -- a lack of volitional control.

17

problem with the Kansas Supreme Court's decision is that

18

it says the only thing that we consider is volitional

19

impairment, but there are many kinds of impairments

20

individuals have that are the result of their mental

21

disorder, and so the Kansas court is necessarily limiting

22

the psychiatric diagnosis to say only volitional

23

impairment --

24
25

QUESTION:

And the

What is there -- I thought there

could be cognitive impairments.

I think Justice Scalia

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

has described one.

There could be emotional impairments.

2

MS. STOVALL:

3

QUESTION:

4

impairments.

5

Yes, sir.

And there could be volitional

Now, is there any other category?

MS. STOVALL:

Perceptual, intellectual.

There

6

-- there are many kinds that are talked about within the

7

psychiatric material.

8

QUESTION:

But are these --

9

QUESTION:

Is there any kind relevant here other

10

than volition?

11
12

MS. STOVALL:

Yes.

I think they all are, all of

those that we mentioned, and perhaps even those --

13

QUESTION:

Are relevant in this case?

14

MS. STOVALL:

15

QUESTION:

Not -- yes.

I'm saying is there any one relevant

16

to the particular individual at issue here other than

17

volition.

18

MS. STOVALL:

I don't believe psychiatrists can

19

tell us what it is that -- what kind of impairment Mr.

20

Crane has.

21

that psychiatrists can't tell whether or not Justice

22

Scalia was acting because he's hallucinating or because

23

it's some other volitional impairment, if it's an

24

irresistible impulse, if you will, whether it's emotional,

25

perceptual, intellectual.

They're not -- the -- the literature will say

They can't tell.

They can't

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

get in somebody's mind.

2

simply rely on what the individual says.

3

And what they have to do then is

Mr. Crane told this -- the court below -- he

4

told the experts below, rather.

He didn't testify.

He

5

told the experts below that he could control his behavior.

6

Mr. Hendricks had testimony that you refer to in the

7

Hendricks decision that said he couldn't control his

8

behavior.

9

determination objectively, we're left with a potential

So, because the psychiatrist can't make a

10

predator telling us who applies -- who's eligible for this

11

law and who isn't.

12

The other point I would make to this Court is

13

that Mr. Hendricks said I can't control my urge to molest

14

children.

15

children in front of their parents, never in front of his

16

wife, never in front of law enforcement --

17

But he could.

QUESTION:

He never molested little

Well, but that's not the premise that

18

Hendricks proceeded upon.

19

that Hendricks rested on an insecure factual assumption.

20
21
22
23

MS. STOVALL:

Now you're -- now you're saying

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

I don't

understand.
QUESTION:

Well, you're -- are you trying to say

that what we said in Hendricks was -- was dictum or --

24

MS. STOVALL:

25

QUESTION:

I --

-- just was -- was wrong in the -- in
7

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the context of that case?

2

MS. STOVALL:

I'm certainly not saying you were

3

wrong, Your Honor.

4

third constitutional standard, that the impairments that

5

I --

6

I'm saying that you did not create a

QUESTION:

Well, was the Court under some

7

misimpression as -- as to Hendricks' ability to control

8

himself?

9

MS. STOVALL:

There wasn't evidence before this

10

Court that would say whether or not Hendricks suffered

11

from a volitional impairment or not.

12

he himself said.

All we have is what

13

QUESTION:

But then, it seems to me, that we're

14

back to square one.

I -- one reading of Hendricks -- and

15

tell me if this is wrong -- is that we want to find some

16

measure of determining how dangerous this person is to

17

society because that's in the statute.

18

criminals are -- have personality disorders and are

19

dangerous to society, we want to narrow it somewhat.

20

we -- so the Court added this volitional control aspect.

21

Is that a fair reading of Hendricks?

22

MS. STOVALL:

And because many

So,

Your Honor, I don't believe it is

23

because Mr. Hendricks, in particular, didn't suffer from a

24

personality disorder.

25

Kansas statute as an abnormality mentally and that was

He had what is classified under the

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

being pedophilia.

2

there are two kinds of impairment that we could look at.

3

They're emotional as well as volitional.

4

QUESTION:

The Kansas statute specifically says

Well, is the test -- are there

5

different requirements if you proceed based on a

6

personality disorder than if you proceed from a mental

7

abnormality?

8
9
10

MS. STOVALL:

think there is because there is no definition in the
statute of a personality disorder.

11
12

Well, the Kansas court seems to

QUESTION:

It wasn't defined --

Well, I was -- I was suggesting that

you thought there was based on the answer you gave to me.

13

MS. STOVALL:

14

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

What --

You think they're both one and the

15

same.

16

abnormality or personality disorder.

17

case, the test for civil commitment is the same.

18
19
20

You have no different requirements for mental

MS. STOVALL:

In -- in either

Based on the Kansas Supreme Court

decision or based on the -QUESTION:

Based on what you think the law ought

21

to be and what the -- and how the statute is properly

22

interpreted.

23

MS. STOVALL:

We believe there is no

24

distinction.

There should be no distinction between

25

mental abnormality and personality disorder, that as long
9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

as we -- we show that mental condition and the

2

dangerousness, that there should not be a distinction.

3

QUESTION:

So, anybody with a personality

4

disorder that's a danger to himself or others can be --

5

can be civilly committed regardless of volitional control.

6

That's -- that's your position.

7

MS. STOVALL:

Right.

They have to have some

8

sort of impairment in order to have the diagnosis of a

9

personality disorder.

That's part and parcel of a

10

diagnosis of the DSM.

But it would be our position it's

11

not limited to volitional control, but could be that

12

laundry list of emotional capacity -- emotional

13

impairment, which is even what the Kansas statute

14

contemplates for mental --

15

QUESTION:

-- the DSM that you're mentioning, if

16

you look at the definition of personality disorder and

17

they say pick three out of a list of seven, you could pick

18

out habitually doesn't work, doesn't pay debts, is

19

reckless, irritable.

20

considerably less than what is defined as an abnormality

21

like pedophilia.

22

would fit that description.

23

That's something -- I mean, it's

There are a lot of ordinary people who

MS. STOVALL:

What -- what I want to be able to

24

do today, Your Honors, is to convince you that actually

25

that's not true, that an antisocial personality disorder
10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is a severe mental pathology that really does give us

2

sociopaths and psychopaths that cannot conform to our

3

rules.

4

certainly in our prisons that break the law, and they may

5

suffer from antisocial personality traits, but that's

6

entirely separate and distinct from having a full-blown

7

diagnosis of an antisocial personality disorder.

There are a lot of individuals in this country and

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, your statute itself, when

you're talking about a sexually violent predator, you say

10

mental abnormality or personality disorder, which makes

11

the person likely to engage in repeat acts of sexual

12

violence.

So, that certainly qualifies the personality

13

disorder.

It's not any personality disorder that would do

14

that.

15

MS. STOVALL:

That's exactly right, Your Honor.

16

The point is that it's a severe diagnosis, for one thing,

17

and then secondly, it has to tie directly to the kind of

18

dangerous behavior that we believe these individuals will

19

commit if they don't have the treatment.

20

QUESTION:

And I take it what your -- what your

21

statute is trying to get at is -- is something more than

22

mere repetitive conduct, mere recidivism.

23

say?

24

MS. STOVALL:

25

QUESTION:

Is that fair to

Absolutely.

And -- and is the element that
11

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

distinguishes this kind of behavior from mere

2

repetitiveness some element of lack of control, not

3

necessarily volitional control, but some element of lack

4

of control, perhaps lack of control resulting from

5

delusion, perceptual difficulties and so on, but -- but

6

some -- some aspect of the personality that -- that gives

7

that individual a -- a lesser chance of controlling

8

behavior in -- in a way that avoids committing crimes.

9

that fair to say?

10

MS. STOVALL:

With a slight exception.

Is

It's the

11

dangerousness, the risk of recidivism tied to a mental

12

disorder.

13

there will be an impairment that's part and parcel of

14

that.

To get the diagnosis of a mental disorder,

15

QUESTION:

Right.

16

MS. STOVALL:

But I want to be clear that we

17

don't think there needs to be a -- a third separate, very

18

distinguishable constitutional element --

19

QUESTION:

I guess what I'm -- I guess what I'm

20

getting at is it -- it seems sensible to call somebody who

21

is just an habitual offender at some dangerous crime or

22

serious crime dangerous.

23

Kansas statute and other statutes like it is trying to get

24

at, by speaking of mental disorder or personality

25

disorder, is some extra element beyond the mere

And I take it that what the

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

probability of doing an act which society has called

2

dangerous.

3

And I think -- I think -MS. STOVALL:

That's 100 percent accurate.

4

That's exactly where we are, Your Honor.

5

that having that mental abnormality or mental disorder

6

gets us away from just predicting who's going to be

7

dangerous.

8
9

QUESTION:

And we think

But what is that -- what is that?

That's exactly the issue.

What is it that you -- how --

10

what form of words will you use to define what counts as a

11

mental disorder that will distinguish the people whom you

12

want to civilly commit from your mine-run recidivist

13

criminal?

14

MS. STOVALL:

15

QUESTION:

That they have to have a mental --

Yes, but what -- that's the problem

16

in the case.

The problem is what counts as a mental

17

disorder.

18

mental disorder is a total inability to control behavior.

And the Kansas court thought what counts as a

19

MS. STOVALL:

20

QUESTION:

21

definition.

22
23
24
25

That's correct.

You say that's not the right

Very well.

MS. STOVALL:

What is?
What is in the statute, a severe

mental -QUESTION:

No, no.

What is the definition of

the word, mental disorder, that appears in the statute?
13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

If a person were to say every person who commits a crime,

2

15 times running, is a sociopath and thereby falls within

3

DSM-IV, you're not going to permit that.

4

distinguish that sociopath from a person who is really

5

mentally disordered and he isn't your mine-run criminal.

6

All right.

7
8

11

Give me the form of words that will do it.
MS. STOVALL:

I believe they are there now,

that --

9
10

You want to

QUESTION:

All that's there now is mental

disorder.
MS. STOVALL:

Well, actually it's mental

12

abnormality and personality disorder.

13

in the Hendricks decision said that pedophilia certainly

14

qualifies as a --

15

QUESTION:

You and this Court

Well, and here we have -- we have

16

here an antisocial personality disorder.

17

the diagnosis.

18
19
20

MS. STOVALL:

That's right.

That -- that was

Along with

exhibitionism.
QUESTION:

And the State's own expert said in

21

Mr. Crane's trial that approximately 75 percent of the

22

prison population has antisocial personality disorder.

23

Now, this is an unusual statute where after the

24

person serves a sentence for the crime, the State can then

25

proceed again and get them locked up for a very long time
14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

because of his dangerousness.

2

MS. STOVALL:

3

QUESTION:

And the mental disorder.

We're trying -- okay.

But most of

4

them -- 75 percent of them was the testimony -- suffer

5

from antisocial personality disorder.

6

going to be able to proceed again against 75 percent of

7

the prison population?

8

an antisocial personality disorder?

9

MS. STOVALL:

So, is the State

What is the added element beyond

I would suggest to you that there

10

doesn't need to be an additional element.

11

acknowledge the expert said 75 percent suffers from that

12

in the deposition, he wasn't -- he certainly didn't quote

13

empirical studies to demonstrate that.

14

that probably 90-95 percent of the prison population

15

suffer from antisocial personality traits, but that's

16

different than a disorder.

17

While I

I would suggest

The antisocial personality disorder, psychopaths

18

and sexual -- psychopaths and sociopaths with actual

19

diagnosis -- and Ted Bundy is the best example of that.

20

These are really serious individuals not 75 percent of the

21

population.

22

QUESTION:

What is it -- what is it about them

23

that we can isolate that shows that they are really

24

serious beyond the mere repetition of their crime?

25

In other words, let me put the question this
15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

way.

2

which, as you put it, there is no third element, why

3

aren't you free to go after, let's say, every second

4

offender of a sexual crime at the time of release and say,

5

this person is dangerous within -- sufficiently dangerous

6

within the meaning of the statute to -- to commit here?

7

Under -- under the rule you want us to adopt in

Now, you're not claiming you can do that, but I

8

want to know what it is that you have to prove that stands

9

in the way of your being able to do that.

10

MS. STOVALL:

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. STOVALL:

13

And -- and --

QUESTION:

15

MS. STOVALL:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. STOVALL:

18

QUESTION:

19

MS. STOVALL:

21

And that's a psychiatrically

approved condition that --

14

20

We have to show a mental illness.

No, but --- you can get an expert --

-- anything in the DSM.
Right.

Then you're -I'm sorry.

Not anything in the

DSM.
QUESTION:

Then you're back to Justice

22

Ginsburg's question, which -- which is very much like

23

Justice O'Connor's.

24

one criterion in the DSM, you're going to pick up, in

25

Justice O'Connor's reference to the experts, 75 percent

If all you've got to do is satisfy

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

probably of your prison population and -- and based on the

2

-- the categorization Justice Ginsburg described, it would

3

seem to me you would pickup a substantial part of the

4

population outside of prison.

5

Now, I know you don't want to do that, but on

6

your theory that there is -- there is no third element

7

beyond this categorization, what stands in the way of your

8

doing that?

9

MS. STOVALL:

The actual diagnosis that those

10

folks actually have those diagnosis and are sexually

11

violent.

12

What I would --

13

Being sexually violent absolutely limits that.

QUESTION:

All right.

Are you saying then that

14

in the example Justice Ginsburg gave you -- what was it --

15

four out of seven in the list?

16

MS. STOVALL:

17

QUESTION:

Three of seven.

That -- that as -- as long as -- as

18

the -- the expert witness says, yes, this person is

19

subject to four out of those seven personality traits,

20

that that person, if a sexual offender, could be locked up

21

under the statute?

22
23

MS. STOVALL:

They could be committed for

treatment under this -- this statute, yes, Your Honor.

24

QUESTION:

Wow.

25

MS. STOVALL:

And Mr. Crane -- what -- what I
17

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

would want you to know, though, is that it is not a --

2

just because these individuals have committed crimes

3

doesn't mean they have an antisocial personality disorder.

4

Of the seven criteria that are listed, that can certainly

5

be supplemented by independent judgment of psychiatrists,

6

of the --

7

QUESTION:

But it would be very -- it -- it

8

would be -- on Justice Ginsburg's example, it would be

9

Supreme Court held the Sexually Violent Predators Act,

MR. DONHAM:

Your Honor, if -- if I have to

fault the opinion in the -- of the Kansas Supreme Court is

10

-- it is that it expanded its decision that was directly

11

for Mr. Crane under the specific subsection of the Kansas

12

Sexual Predator Act that dealt with individuals who had

13

been found criminally responsible.

14

and its terminology to give effect to all commitments.

And it expanded that

The -- the Sexual Predator Act is and should be

16

available for individuals such as your hypothetical,

17

individuals who, because of some psychosis or

18

hallucinations, have in effect lost their ability to

19

control their behavior as well, although perhaps through

20

some better recognized form.

21

specific subsections of the Kansas Sexual Predator Act

that would pull those people in for a commitment

Mr. Crane, however, was in that unique section

responsible, who are competent to stand trial, who are

for Mr. Hendricks was his professed inability to control

unable to control his behavior.

14

MR. DONHAM:

Are you saying that was

Your Honor, as -- as I read --

15

Hendricks stands for the proposition that the Kansas act

16

is constitutional because, as with Mr. Hendricks, what it

17

determined was that the State was not seeking to

involuntarily commit people based on dangerousness alone,

which would have been absolutely unconstitutional under

QUESTION:

The only way

I just read -- I just read the

portion of the -- of the opinion that I think the most

10

relevant, and what it says is difficult, if not

11

impossible, to control behavior.

12

impossibility to control behavior would be very difficult.

13

That's -- that's what it said.

14

To show utter

Now -- now, you equate that difficulty or if not

15

impossibility to control behavior with volitional

impairment.

17

think the Kansas Supreme Court did?

to say that if there's no volitional impairment, there

cannot be this difficulty or impossibility of controlling

behavior.

Why do you -- why do you equate that, as I
They -- they seemed

But that doesn't seem to me to be true.
MR. DONHAM:

Well, when Mr. Hendricks professed

22

that he could not control his behavior, that's an

23

indication that when confronted with temptation, he was

24

unable to exercise his free will.

25

QUESTION:

That's right.

behavior to society's requirements.

I'm not standing here

10

today as a psychiatrist or a psychologist.

It's a murky

11

subject at best, and even those who work in it disagree.

12

The principal distinction that I take from the

13

Hendricks decision is that Mr. Hendricks could not have

14

been constitutionally involuntarily committed absent that

15

additional element that set him apart from others who

16

simply behave out of clear choice because they lack any

17

respect or moral value.

18

QUESTION:

Well, I would have thought, really,

19

that that is not what we limited it to in Hendricks, that

20

a delusional lack of control would be entirely sufficient

21

constitutionally as -- as it relates to a lack of control,

22

that it could be volitional or delusional, that the Kansas

23

court went too far in requiring only volitional as a

24

constitutional standard.

in this case was volitional.

MR. DONHAM:

Your Honor, to the first part of

21

your question, the only available argument that we could

22

have made, the only conceivable jury instruction that

23

would have been consistent with the contradictory evidence

24

at trial and this Court's opinion in Hendricks was a -- a

25

demand for a jury instruction, requiring the jury to find

that it was his mental abnormality or his personality

disorder that made him be likely to re-offend because it

3

interfered with his ability to control his behavior.

QUESTION:

So, what are the words that you want

5

there?

That is, imagine I'm talking about the set of

6

people who are very dangerous.

the set of people who are very dangerous because of a

In defining mental problem, we could have

have a set of people who have an emotional disorder well

beyond what the ordinary prisoner recidivist has, and we

13

could be talking about what the Kansas Supreme Court

14

thought it was talking about in this case, the set of

15

people who arguably have a volitional disorder.

16

respect to that, it sounded to me, if that's the subject

17

of this case, that the Kansas court used the word cannot

18

control, whereas our Court used the word difficult, if not

impossible, to control.

there is some difference between those two, and I would

think there is.

MR. DONHAM:

10

I'm not sure if I know how to answer that.

11

that if you perform the criminal act, your control was not

12

adequate.

13

personnel are going to have to end up testifying and what

14

eventually will be a question for the jury to decide is

15

whether or not, given the opportunity and the chance for

16

success at committing a criminal act, this individual

17

chose to do that as an exercise of his or her free will or

whether or not some overriding mental condition compelled

19

them to act or disabled their capacity to refrain from

acting.

2

It's just a bad jury instruction that occurred?

3

MR. DONHAM:

You think the statute is fine.

4

the Kansas statute, the legislative body intended that the

5

mental defect caused the individual to be likely to commit

6

future predatory acts of violence.

QUESTION:

It -- it says exactly that, and

you think that's okay.

9

MR. DONHAM:

10
11

No.

QUESTION:

Yes, and this Court -And the Kansas Supreme Court didn't

think it was okay.

12

MR. DONHAM:

I disagree with that.

I -- I think

13

-- and allow me to follow up.

14

reinforced the notion that the Kansas act is

15

constitutional because there did exist, at least with Mr.

16

Hendricks, an additional element that because of that,

17

because of his mental illness, he was likely to offend.

18

This Court in Hendricks

The State -- or the Kansas Supreme Court was

19

presented simply the fact pattern in Mr. Crane's case, and

20

-- and that fact pattern was essentially -- or at least

21

the State's position was we don't have to prove any kind

22

of additional element whatsoever.

23

QUESTION:

Well, they have to prove the

24

causality.

You're saying they don't have to prove

25

causality.

I mean, the way the statute reads is:
43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

who

suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder

which makes the person likely to engage in repeat acts of

3

sexual violence.

4

commit future acts of sexual violence, but it also must be

5

shown that the reason he's likely to do it is because that

6

is caused by a mental abnormality or personality disorder.

7

I mean, it seems to me, the statute says exactly what you

8

think it ought to say, and you're just -- you're now

9

complaining about the jury instruction?

10

It's not just that he's likely to -- to

MR. DONHAM:

We did object to the jury

11

instruction because we felt it did not adequately address

12

the theme that the State carried to the jury.

13

State presented to the jury, through all four of its

14

expert witnesses, is that Mr. Crane satisfied the

15

definition of a sexually violent predator because of his

16

prior repetitive history of criminal offenses.

17

expert, Dr. Mabugat, even testified on the stand that if

18

-- that in satisfying this definition, if the jurors only

19

take his current mental status, coupled with his instant

20

offense for the aggravated sexual battery, he's not a

21

sexually violent predator.

Dr. Mabugat went on to testify --

application of the act.

pattern of Mr. Crane for which the only available and the

11

only reasonable qualifying mental defect would have been

12

the inability to control behavior and saying that it's now

required for all persons, what the Kansas Supreme Court

14

did was effectively cut off, I think unfairly, the ability

15

of the State to incapacitate people who have other type of

pointed out, the hallucinations, the psychoses.
