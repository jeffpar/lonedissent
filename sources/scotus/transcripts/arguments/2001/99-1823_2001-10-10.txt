CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Clement.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Respondent Waffle House and Eric Baker agreed to

12

arbitrate rather than litigate disputes between them.

13

That agreement precludes Waffle House and Baker from

14

having an action take place between them in court.

15

the EEOC was not a party to that agreement.

16

the agreement does not preclude the EEOC's ability to

17

bring a public enforcement action against Waffle House,

18

nor does it limit the remedies available to the EEOC in

19

such an action.

20

But

Accordingly,

Title VII gives the EEOC a public enforcement

21

action that's independent of and, in many respects,

22

superior to the individual employee's cause of action.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Clement, suppose the individual

24

employee had settled with the employer, not just an

25

agreement to arbitrate, but there had been a complete

MR. CLEMENT:

Because in the case of settlement,

of course, judicial or arbitral resources have already

2

If you can imagine a case where an employer has

3

retaliated against an employee and -- simply for filing a

4

charge with the EEOC, and then that employee settles that

5

retaliation claim for a nominal amount of money, without

6

any judicial supervision, let's say, it may be that in

7

that kind of case, the EEOC has a legitimate public

8

interest in, nonetheless, bringing an action, getting some

9

additional amount of damages to really take the

10

employer --

QUESTION:

Well, but that's -- that's a separate

wrong.

would think that's a separate component.

I don't know if that's a really fair answer to

But just suppose a case with no retaliation.

16

The -- the employee recovers $10,000 and then the EEOC can

17

recover $20,000 more?

18

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, in a case like that, I'm

19

sure as a matter of its prosecutorial discretion, the EEOC

20

would not bring that case.

instances.

general principle, which is simply that Congress in Title

21

VII gave the EEOC a distinct cause of action, and so the

more of a difficult case because in that case, the

2

individuals settled their claim, so they have no claim to

make some sense to say that the EEOC has no claim to

5

damages in a litigation proceeding.

6

And so, it might

What is so anomalous about the decision below

7

and the rule that respondent seeks in this case is that it

8

seeks to limit the EEOC's ability to get victim-specific

9

remedies in court even though those victim-specific

10

remedies are available to the employee in the arbitration.

11

All of the cases that respondent cites --

12

QUESTION:

Well, here we have a case where the

13

employee did not settle, but we were really discussing

14

with you the possibility not presented in this case of a

15

full settlement or a judgment in arbitration, disposing of

16

the victim-specific relief, and asking you why then should

17

EEOC continue to have a cause of action for the victim-

18

specific relief, as opposed to broad injunctive relief, to

19

address the overall problem.

20

MR. CLEMENT:

And I guess I do think there are

21

two reasons why they would still have a cause of action in

22

that situation.

an independent cause of action.

statute in that respect.

has analyzed in, say, the Newport News Shipbuilder case

One is that Title VII does give the EEOC

1

where it specifically contrasted Title VII as being the

2

rare statute that gives the EEOC a duplicative cause of

3

action to the individual.

4

The second reason, though, is that generally, as

5

a matter of privity, res judicata principles, the reason

6

that you hold one party in --in -- to a judgment that they

7

didn't participate in to the consequences of that is

8

because the party in the first action adequately

9

represented the interests of the party that wasn't

10
11

present.

I -QUESTION:

Well, why did the EEOC decide to get

12

into this case?

13

practice involved that goes beyond this individual

establishment?

15

Is there some sort of a pattern or

My understanding is that the EEOC

16

picked this case because this case -- the events here took

17

place in 1994.

18

time that this -- that this case took place, and I think

19

the EEOC was concerned that employers were not sure of

20

what their obligations under the ADA were.

21

picked this case to litigate to help establish what

22

employers' obligations were under the EEOC --

23

So, the ADA was still quite new at the

1

MR. CLEMENT:

That's fair enough.

But again,

2

Congress has specifically allowed the EEOC to use its

3

modest litigation resources to vindicate the public

4

interest both in pattern and practice cases or cases that

5

seek injunctive relief and victim-specific cases where

6

there's some aspect of the case that helps illustrate an

7

important principle of law.

8

QUESTION:

Mr. --

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Clement, may I ask you to back up

10

on how we would get to the point of having a settlement

11

after -- or an arbitral determination?

12

EEOC sues, then the individual has no right to come to

13

court, that EEOC would be the exclusive litigator.

14

so, I think it's clear that the -- the individual employee

15

couldn't bring a suit, a rival suit, in -- in court.

16

I thought when the

And

Doesn't that extend to arbitration as well?

I

17

thought that the -- giving the primacy to the EEOC meant

18

it would control this entire claim in all of its aspects,

19

but you answered the question as though, even though the

20

EEOC had filed, the employee could go on on a separate

21

track.

22

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I had taken the import of

23

the hypothetical as being that the individual had already

24

sued and settled and then, only after that had taken

25

place, that the EEOC decided to initiate a duplicative

1

action.

2
3

But your question certainly highlights the
anomaly of having this predispute arbitration agreement --

4

QUESTION:

Can the individual bring a suit?

5

mean, is the -- within the 180 days, doesn't EEOC have

6

total control?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

That's absolutely right.

I

The

8

statute gives the EEOC the exclusive right to initiate a

9

cause of action for the first 180 days and then, for an

10

extended period, until a right to sue letter issues.

11

And that's why in light of the -- the

12

congressional determination that -- that EEOC had not only

13

a different action, but one that took primacy, that they

14

had the right to initiate the action once they found that

15

there was a determination that the suit would serve the

16

public interest, it seems particularly --

17

QUESTION:

Once they -- once they do initiate

18

the action, though, the individual cannot also bring an

19

action.

20

that the EEOC suit is independent of the individuals, but

21

somehow the individual suit is not independent of the

22

EEOC's.

23

Right?

So, what you're saying is that the --

Well, allow -- allow me to make

So, if those actions were

7

think that cuts in your favor rather than against you.

8

seems to me the whole structure of the thing indicates

9

that there's one cause of action.

10

It can be brought by

the EEC or by the individual, but not by both.

11

MR. CLEMENT:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. CLEMENT:

I mean --

Not by both successfully, anyway.
I respectfully disagree because,

14

unlike the ADA, the ADA does not make the EEOC suit the

15

exclusive vehicle and extinguish any cause of action or

16

any basis to get into court for the individual.

QUESTION:

by the arbitration agreement?

consequence of the arbitration agreement and the

Well, if it is a distortion of the

aren't we?

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, even if you disagree with me

on -- on that particular point and you say that the FAA

does not prevent Baker from intervening on this action,

it's still true that the arbitration agreement is -- has a

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, actually they could get the

If, for whatever reason, we've gotten to the point where

somebody has filed a claim and it's settled, that role has

already been filled.

5

The third reason is another particularly

6

important function of the EEOC under Title VII is to act

7

as a safety valve, so if for some reason the individual is

8

not willing or able to sue, maybe out of a fear of

vindicates the public interest, the EEOC has the ability

to step in and fill that gap.

Circuit's ruling is they take an agreement that limits

But you do say that the employee

It's clear in the statute that that's true as to

MR. CLEMENT:

That's equally, of course -- I

equally a problem with the Fourth Circuit's rule, of

Suppose that an employer and an employee agreed

It certainly wouldn't seem to me that that agreement to

But I think

1

the purpose of the FAA, as I understand it, was to put

2

arbitration contracts on an equal footing with other

3

contracts, not to give them some special private place.

4

And we think that that forum selection clause that picked

5

the State forum would be enforceable between the parties,

6

but we just don't think it makes any sense to say that

7

that agreement between the parties somehow leaps out and

bars the EEOC from bringing a Federal enforcement action,

9

or even more puzzlingly I think, restricting the remedies

10

available to the EEOC in that public enforcement action.

11

It seems to me that at -- at bottom Title VII

12

gives the EEOC a right to bring a public enforcement

14

QUESTION:

The trouble is it's not a public

Why -- why require two separate suits:

If the agency is going to be in there, it may as

11

MR. CLEMENT:

QUESTION:

Well --

But -- but to say that the portion of

it that compensates the individual is essentially, you

know, a vindication of the public doesn't seem to me --

doesn't seem to me reasonable.

sue for the money to go into the pocket of the employee, I

3

thought that those were characterized as public interest

actions.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

That's absolutely right.

I mean,

6

every time a wrongdoer pays money, the payment of that

7

money serves a public interest that's independent of the

8

destination of the payment, whether it goes to the

9

individual who was wronged or some sort of public

enforcement action.

11

And again, I suggest the example of a

retaliation action.

charge with the EEOC, the EEOC clearly vindicates the

public interest when it files suit to take the employer to

retaliation and the most effective remedies are victim-

specific.

victim-specific remedies because, after all, it is clear

as day from Title VII itself that an employer can't

retaliate against an employee for filing a charge.

Firefighters case?
MR. CLEMENT:

Yes.

I would -- I would direct

you to Local No. 93 v. City of Cleveland.

There's a

statement in that case that I think was just meant to

11

reflect a general principle that parties to a litigation

can't, through a settlement, bind a non-party to the

parties had their own injury of a pecuniary nature, as I

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GORDON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The answer to the question presented today is

found in the broad terms and policies of the Federal

14

Arbitration Act.

15

does Mr. Baker's arbitration agreement have on the EEOC's

16

litigation remedies.

17

The question, of course, is what effect

The Fourth Circuit correctly held that the EEOC

18

could bring in court a claim for broad-based injunctive

19

relief and declaratory relief.

20

had agreed to arbitrate his claims, he could not seek

21

relief in court specifically for Mr. Baker.

22

However, because Mr. Baker

Now, I -- I listened carefully to Mr. Clement's

correctly, he did take that position, but he said you

don't have to take that position to prevail in this case.

Is that right?

11
12

MR. GORDON:

Well, perhaps I perceived it

differently, Your Honor.

13

But I -- I do think that from our position it's

14

very important for the Court to understand that the cases

15

are almost uniform for the proposition that if an

individual settles a case --

QUESTION:

Mr. Gordon, but that's so highly

Once the EEOC brings in -- the case in court,

mustn't its suit be given primacy to determine the basic

question, was there discrimination in violation of the

act?

5

MR. GORDON:

Your Honor, we do not believe it

should be given primacy when an individual has signed an

7

arbitration agreement in which he says I agree that all

8

claims arising out of my employment shall be resolved in

It would, Your Honor, if there were

QUESTION:

But the other way around, if the

8

arbitrator, say, finds no discrimination in that

9

arbitration forum, couldn't bind the EEOC because the EEOC

10

wasn't party to that litigation.

11

MR. GORDON:

Am I right about that?

Well, I would have to disagree with

12

you on that because I believe that in the arbitration, if

13

there were -- an adjudication was made as to Mr. Baker and

14

in -- as in this particular case -- if I may use this case

15

as the example, in this particular case, Mr. Baker is the

only game in town here.

The EEOC is seeking relief solely

17

on behalf of Mr. Baker.

All damages will go to Mr. Baker.

Let's -- let's cut out the relief

aspect of it and again concentrate on the issue, was there

preclude the EEOC from litigating that basic question,

whatever remedies would attach to it, doesn't it follow

that the EEOC's suit must be allowed to go forward and

have the question of discrimination determined in that

MR. GORDON:

Your Honor, I -- I still believe

7

that there's no reason to wait in this case, that the

8

arbitration can go forward to resolve Mr. Baker's

9

individual claims, that the EEOC, under the Fourth Circuit

10

rule, can go forward and have the claims for broad-based

11

injunctive relief heard there.

12

And I -- I must say that there may be separate

13

issues being litigated in that EEOC court proceeding

14

because --

15

QUESTION:

But isn't it true that for any

16

relief, there must be a finding that the employer has

17

violated the act?

18

MR. GORDON:

There must be, but in the court

19

proceeding, there's going to be a broader finding, that

20

there is some pattern or practice of discrimination going

21

on that may or -- may or may not apply to Mr. Baker.

If

That would be.

against violating the title has been -- has been violated.

And let's assume that the employee who claims that -- that

arbitration agreement.

Does it have to go to arbitration?

QUESTION:

But why isn't your -- why isn't your

7

claim to the vindication of the arbitration agreement the

8

same in the future case as it was in the past case?

9

MR. GORDON:

Because the relief that is awarded

10

to a particular individual is awarded in arbitration.

11

Assuming that relief was awarded, then that would probably

12

end the participation of the arbitrator at that point.

13

QUESTION:

The contempt action wouldn't be

assume.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. CLEMENT:

15

I want to first pick up on Justice Souter's

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

16

hypothetical about the contempt proceeding.

17

me that if that were enforced by civil compensatory

18

contempt, rather than a criminal contempt action brought

19

by the U.S. attorney, that he'd -- he'd have the same

20

problem at the end of the day.

21

It seems to

Respondents invoke the proposition that the EEOC

22

has to take the victim as we find him.

23

that is that principle applies with respect to damages

24

problems, like a failure to mitigate, that apply to the

25

individual employee whether or not he arbitrates or

1

litigates and applies equally to an EEOC enforcement

2

action and to the individual claim.

3

What's so unique about this is that respondent

4

is attempting to take an agreement that does not restrict

5

Baker's ability to get any remedy in the arbitration

6

proceeding and turn it into a restriction on the remedies

7

available to the EEOC in its action.

8
9

The problem is, this is not, at bottom, a
restriction on damages or a problem with remedies.

It is

10

a forum selection clause.

11

structure that allows two people to initiate an action.

12

When one of those parties has signed a forum selection

13

clause and hasn't even initiated the action, it seems that

14

even in the general case there would be no reason to

15

restrict the other party's access to forums or their

16

remedies.

17

statute like Title VII that gives the EEOC a right of

18

first refusal over the initiation of the action.

19

And you have a statutory

That would seem to be a fortiori true for a

Another point I'd like to emphasize is that, as

20

Justice Stevens made clear, there are currently no suits

21

pending against employers in a situation where there has

22

been a previous settlement.

23

suits currently in the entirety of the EEOC's docket, and

24

I think that puts this case in perspective.

25

literally 99 cases out of 100, an employer's arbitration

In fact, there are only 450

In the

1

agreement will govern and the only Title VII claim that

2

will be brought is the employee's claim in arbitration.

3

In the 1 case out of 100, in the extreme case where

4

there's some important public principle at stake or

5

there's particularly egregious conduct, the EEOC's public

6

enforcement action serves as a valuable safety valve that

7

allows it to preserve the possibility of precedent-setting

8

in public judicial proceedings.

9

The third and final point I'd like to make is

10

that whatever the answer is in the settlement context,

11

there's absolutely no reason to take a restriction that

12

only restricts the available forum and not the remedies

13

and turn it into a restriction on remedies but not the

14

forum.

the results of an arbitration, but to prevent the EEOC

from seeking all remedies even when there hasn't been any
