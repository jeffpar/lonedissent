ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. McALLISTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Choices have consequences, but they nonetheless

11

remain choices.

12

such as a personal television or how much an inmate may

13

spend at the canteen, privileges which are not part of an

14

inmate's sentence and to which an inmate has no legal

15

entitlement, does not amount to constitutional compulsion

16

in violation of the Fifth Amendment, certainly not when

17

the reason for the withdrawal of those privileges is the

18

inmate's failure to comply with an unquestionably

19

legitimate treatment requirement that he accept

20

responsibility for his offenses.

21

The mere withdrawal of prison privileges

QUESTION:

The problem, though, is he's forced,

22

in effect, to confront the treatment possibility.

It's

23

not an option.

24

I think, is the fact that this is not a scheme, as I

25

understand the Federal scheme, in which the inmate says, I

I mean, the tough part of the case for me,

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

want to take advantage of this treatment program.

2

a scheme in which the State says, you're going to take

3

advantage of it, and if you don't take advantage of it,

4

including the admissions in the reports of other offenses,

5

and so on, you're going to lose substantial privileges.

6

That, to me, is the tough part of the case.
MR. McALLISTER:

7

This is

That's true, Justice Souter,

8

and our program does differ from the Federal program in

9

that respect, but it is still a choice for Mr. Lile.

He

10

does not have to incriminate himself in any way.

11

refusal to participate is not at all incriminating, and

12

what we're talking about in terms of what he may lose here

13

are really relatively mild incentives within the prison -QUESTION:

14

His

I thought that the participation

15

required the prisoner to describe previous offenses that

16

he may have been --

MR. McALLISTER:

QUESTION:

--

If he participates.
committed.
If he participates.

That he may have committed if he

participates.
MR. McALLISTER:

22

Right, but what I'm saying is,

23

if he simply refuses to participate, there's no

24

incrimination whatsoever, nothing drawn from that.

25

simply --

He

1

QUESTION:

But what happens if he refuses?

Is

2

he put in a different type of confinement with different

3

terms and conditions?

4

MR. McALLISTER:

He can be, yes, and he will

5

certainly, with our privilege incentive level system, as

6

the inmates work their way through they have more

7

privileges, and they're in the nature of how much they can

8

spend at the canteen --

9
10

QUESTION:

Well, everybody goes in presumably at

the same level.

11

MR. McALLISTER:

12

QUESTION:

13

They start at intake.

You're screened, and you start at the

same level of control.

14

MR. McALLISTER:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

Now, the prisoner says no, I don't

16

want to participate in that program.

17

he stays in that opening level, or

18

put in something even more severe than that?

19

MR. McALLISTER:

Does that mean that
is he then potentially

The Kansas regulations say, if

20

an inmate is recommended for this treatment program and he

21

refuses, he goes from level 3 to level 1.

22

level 3 because when we adopted this incentive scheme

23

several years ago we grandfathered in all the inmates at

24

the highest level, so we started them out with the level 3

25

privileges, which is the highest they can achieve in

Mr. Lile is at

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

prison, and it was then theirs to lose by not complying

2

with rules and committing disciplinary infractions, and so

3

forth, so he was at level 3, and when he refused to

4

participate he then comes down to level 1.

5

QUESTION:

Is that where he is today?

6

MR. McALLISTER:

Well, he's actually not,

7

because he got an injunction against -- in this case

8

against actually carrying out this program.

9

QUESTION:

In the future --

10

QUESTION:

So is he still incarcerated?

11

MR. McALLISTER:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. McALLISTER:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, he is.

And he's at level 3?
Level 3, yes.

In the future, what's at issue is not

15

being deprived a benefit you already have, but of not

16

giving you benefits that you don't have?

17

MR. McALLISTER:

18

QUESTION:

19

Well, I --

I mean, the reason he's being chopped

down from 3 to 1 was that he was grandfathered.

20

MR. McALLISTER:

21

QUESTION:

He was grandfathered in.

But in the future, he would simply

22

not make it from 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3, if he didn't go

23

into the program?
MR. McALLISTER:

24
25

Very possibly.

I mean, very

possibly.

6
Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

Because there's been some dispute

2

between you and the other side as to whether this is

3

simply the denial of a benefit or a punishment, and I'm

4

not sure there's a whole lot of difference, but -MR. McALLISTER:

5
6
7

And in the context of the

prison -QUESTION:

-- for the grandfathered people it

8

looks more like a punishment, chopping him down to 1, but

9

in the future, at least, he just doesn't get promoted from

10
11
12
13

1 to 2 to 3.
MR. McALLISTER:

That's certainly a possibility,

and one thing about -QUESTION:

You say it's a possibility.

I mean,

14

I suppose it's always a possibility, but does the scheme

15

for those who are not grandfathered provide that they will

16

never yet be on the intake level if they are a sex

17

offender and so on, unless they agree to this?

18

MR. McALLISTER:

No.

They will progress, unless

19

they have other reasons that they're not, because what

20

happens with this program, it's an 18-month program.

21

inmates are not even evaluated, typically, for release

22

until they're 2 years from their scheduled release date,

23

so anybody with a sentence of any length will go several

24

years in the system, working their way up if they're

25

complying with what they're supposed to do.

QUESTION:

Well then, the only person that's

2

going to be in the position that Justice Scalia described

3

is the person who's been getting in trouble along the way

4

and never does progress.

5

petitioner here is going to be in the same position as

6

this petitioner.
MR. McALLISTER:

7

The person, I take it, like this

Yes, potentially, but in our

8

view it doesn't matter in the prison, should not matter in

9

the prison context whether you view it as taking away a

10

benefit or not bestowing a benefit, because none of these

11

inmates come in with an expectation to any of these

12

privileges.
QUESTION:

13

Could the -- Kansas do that -- this

14

with respect to a prisoner who's writing letters to the

15

editor, to the newspaper, complaining about prison

16

conditions?

They say, well, this -- all this is

17

privileged.

We don't have to give you anything.

18

no --

19

MR. McALLISTER:

You have

I think that's a different

20

case, and that probably takes the Court quickly to Turner,

21

where the Court has addressed the --

22

QUESTION:

But why is the First Amendment

23

different from the Self-Incrimination Clause?

I mean, if

24

in the one case you can't disadvantage the person for

25

exercising that constitutional right, why in the other

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

case can you?

I mean --

2

MR. McALLISTER:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. McALLISTER:

Two --

-- you have the First Amendment -Two things, Justice Ginsburg.

5

One, we don't think we are disadvantaging here in terms of

6

actually compelling him.

7

QUESTION:

But then you should say the same

8

thing about the First Amendment.

9

anything you're entitled to.

You've no liberty interest,

10

property interest, all that.

If that follows, then what's

11

wrong with saying --

12

MR. McALLISTER:

You're not taking away

But in the First Amendment

13

context he has a right, a free speech right or a right of

14

access to the courts that may be at issue.

15

context, all the Fifth Amendment says is, no person shall

16

be compelled, so --

17

QUESTION:

18

As I recall it, the First Amendment

says -- speaks of abridgement --

19

MR. McALLISTER:

20

QUESTION:

21
22
23
24
25

In this

Yes.

-- right, and Fifth Amendment speaks

of compulsion.
MR. McALLISTER:

Compulsion, that's the language

in the amendment.
QUESTION:

I'm concerned about the same thing

Justice Ginsburg is concerned -- I have to say I can't

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

find in our cases a statement that a burden on your -- or

2

an unconstitutional condition which involves the Fifth

3

Amendment is barred, but I'm wondering if it oughtn't to

4

be.
Is it your -- it seems to me to follow from your

5
6

position that every prisoner in Kansas could be told,

7

either you confess to the crime for which you've been

8

convicted and all other crimes you've committed or you go

9

to maximum security for the rest of your time here.
MR. McALLISTER:

10
11

Not necessarily, Justice

Kennedy.
QUESTION:

12

Because I think the State does have

13

an interest in saying, we want to rehabilitate you, and

14

it's best for you to confront your wrong.

15

the statute, or the rule I've proposed is problematic?

16

it different from what you're proposing?
MR. McALLISTER:

17

Would you say
Is

I think it's potentially

18

different, although it is potentially permissible

19

constitutionally, but the question would become, what sort

20

of legitimate valid penological interest do we have?

21

we have such an interest in having every inmate do that

22

from the day they enter prison?
QUESTION:

23
24
25

Do

This is very different.

I think you can make a better

argument.
MR. McALLISTER:

We could make that argument.

1
2

4

QUESTION:

It's better for people to confront

the consequences of what they've done.
MR. McALLISTER:

We could make that argument,

and in this case it's critical, actually --

5

QUESTION:

I'd be very troubled by that.

6

MR. McALLISTER:

Well, it's much more than that

7

in this case, because here the therapists are clear that

8

denial is a big problem with sex offenders, and to

9

overcome that denial we need a meaningful acceptance of

10

responsibility, not an immunity that simply allows the

11

inmate to talk with no consequence whatsoever,

12

potentially.

13

what we're after here, and Mr. Lile has not questioned

14

that's a legitimate --

15

We need a meaningful acceptance, and that's

QUESTION:

Well, you think it can only be

16

meaningful if you compel them to admit to a new crime for

17

which they could be prosecuted?

18

MR. McALLISTER:

Except with all due respect,

19

Justice O'Connor, we would not say we're compelling them.

20

We're simply giving them a choice that has some real

21

consequences.

22

want to participate.

23

this program, so we don't need inmates in this program who

24

are not serious about this.

25

willing to take advantage of the program as it's done,

We want people in this program who really
We have a waiting list to get into

We have plenty who are

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

right now, and it's full, and there's a waiting list.
QUESTION:

2

Then why isn't your penalogical

3

interest satisfied in confining the program to those who

4

want to be in it, who will not be subject to this

5

compulsion, if that's what it is?

6

I mean, your argument is that we have a

7

penalogical interest, in effect, that justifies these

8

consequences.
MR. McALLISTER:

9

QUESTION:

10

Yes, we do.

But if you could fill your program

11

without even having to raise the issue that involves these

12

consequences, why do you have a penalogical interest in

13

the insistence that gives rise to this case?
MR. McALLISTER:

14

Because these fellows have

15

proven that most -- or, not most, but many of them will

16

not voluntarily engage in this program, even though they

17

need --

18

QUESTION:

I'm assuming that is so, but if you

19

can fill the program with people who will, why is there an

20

interest in effect in forcing the issue for those who do

21

not want to do it voluntarily?

22

MR. McALLISTER:

Because we still have an

23

interest in rehabilitating all of these sex offenders.

24

Just because some of them are more willing to be

25

rehabilitated doesn't mean the State does not have an

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

interest -QUESTION:

2

Well, if the program is full, then is

3

your interest in simply getting statements of guilt or

4

something from people who will never go into the program?
MR. McALLISTER:

5

No, and that's why he has the

6

choice.

He can simply refuse.

He could refuse, and

7

there's no incrimination if he refuses to participate, but

8

what he's doing is taking up a bed in the medium part of

9

the facility, which is overcrowded at this point, in

10

essence double-celled everyone, and the medium unit is a

11

working unit.

12

actively involved in prison programs, and so we just don't

13

have the space.

14

programs, we'll move you.

15

with Mr. Lile.

16

The medium unit is for people who are

If you're not going to work at your

QUESTION:

That's what we're trying to do

But it's not a voluntary program,

17

it's a conscription system.

18

you to go back to the rehabilitation thing, because that

19

is an aim, an aspiration for every prisoner, and you made

20

very strongly the point that the first step in

21

rehabilitation is acceptance of responsibility.

22

so, I don't see why you -- this -- you could not do this

23

with every prisoner who enters.

24
25

What you -- first, I'd like

If that's

You could say, take responsibility by confessing
that you did what you were accused of doing, no matter

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

what your defense was.

Two, tell us about all your other

2

nefarious deeds.

3

reasons that you did seem to me to be across the board.

4

Is there any distinction, any constitutional distinction

5

that you would make, or are you saying yes, we could do

6

this in the case of every prisoner?

7

MR. McALLISTER:

You apply this to sex offenders, but the

If there's -- as long as

8

there's a deter -- a legitimate penalogical interest, yes,

9

potentially we could.

We don't.

We're only focused on

10

the sex offenders here, but if there's a legitimate reason

11

to do it, potentially --

12

QUESTION:

Well, let's take out the if, because

13

is there or isn't there?

14

that you incarcerate there is an interest in

15

rehabilitating that person.

16

MR. McALLISTER:

17

QUESTION:

Is it -- in the case of everyone

Absolutely.

And you have said that the first step

18

in rehabilitation is acceptance of responsibility for the

19

wrong that you've done.

20

MR. McALLISTER:

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

But you also rely, don't you, Mr.

22

McAllister, on the fact that the therapists for this

23

particular type of crime have come down very hard on the

24

idea, and I take it perhaps there may not be the same body

25

of support for that sort of treatment for other offenders.

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. McALLISTER:

And there's certainly not, for

2

example, treatment programs necessarily for burglars or

3

robbers or other categories.

4

somewhat special in that respect.

5

QUESTION:

The sex offender program is

But constitutionally, if suddenly

6

somebody got a good idea here and a psychiatrist came

7

forward saying yes, you can reform property criminals too,

8

we'd be in exactly the same boat.

9

MR. McALLISTER:

Yes, potentially, and that's

10

not, in our view, a constitutional problem, because this

11

Court has long said none of the things we're talking about

12

here are atypical in prison.

13

particular expectation of a particular set of living

14

conditions within prison.

15

They could be transferred from one prison to another for

16

whatever reason or no reason at all, without violating the

17

Constitution.

try to get these fellows to meaningfully participate in

19

the program.

20

The inmates have no

Meachum v. Fano is very clear.

This is a very mild incentive program to

QUESTION:

The kind of conundrum that puzzles me

21

that I don't have an answer to is illustrated by the trial

22

process itself.

23

possibly say, if you insist on your right to a jury trial,

24

and insist on your right to remain silent, we're going to

25

sentence you to 10 more years in jail.

I suppose the Government couldn't

But the Government

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

can say, if you confess, and don't go to trial, and show

2

true contrition, we'll give you 10 years less.

3

written into the guidelines.

That's

4

But they seem to come to the same thing.

5

that seems to be true of this case, and if I could

6

understand how to analyze the first, I might be able to

7

understand how to analyze the second.

8
9

MR. McALLISTER:

Well,

Well, Justice Breyer, to say

the first is different, or in essence we're different,

10

because all of our -- this takes place inside the prison.

11

The expectations are quite different.

12

discuss Sandin in the briefs, not because it is

13

necessarily transportable to the Fifth Amendment, but what

14

Sandin recognizes is prisons are very different, and what

15

the expectations are, what the hardships are is just a

16

very different situation than free citizens, and what they

17

may be confronted within the way of choices.

18

QUESTION:

That's why we

You are saying you can have two

19

classes of prisoners, those who have confessed to their

20

crimes and those who haven't, and you can treat them

21

differently, no TV, no meat at lunch, no recreation, no

22

softball, and it seems to me the necessary consequence of

23

that for a prisoner facing a long term is that it's going

24

to induce confessions from innocent people.

25

MR. McALLISTER:

Except, Justice Kennedy -- it

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

may do that, but our program, just like the Federal

2

program, has pretty strict confidentiality limits.

3

Basically there's a patient-therapist privilege that

4

operates here, and the only reason -- they're given a form

5

right up front that says the only reasons the therapist

6

will disclose anything that's disclosed to the therapist,

7

very limited, things that deal with safety within the

8

prison, threats to other inmates --

9

QUESTION:

10

QUESTION:

Mr. -I thought you conceded -- you

11

conceded that a prosecutor, say, in the sexual history --

12

he says, I committed X, Y, Z rapes -- that a prosecutor,

13

as long as there's no statute of limitations problem, in

14

Kansas -- unlike, as I understand the Federal program is,

15

a prosecutor could say, okay, now we're going to indict

16

you for that.

17

MR. McALLISTER:

My understanding is they could

18

do that in the Federal program as well, because there's no

19

immunity granted under the Federal program either, so if

20

they actually made a statement, the Federal program could

21

MR. McALLISTER:

2

QUESTION:

That's true, but --

But under yours, in any case, whether

3

the Feds do it or not, under yours the prosecutor could

4

use that information, couldn't he?

5

MR. McALLISTER:

6
7

Could.

We never have, but

could, yes, theoretically could.
QUESTION:

May I ask you, Mr. McAllister, do you

8

know -- there's similar programs in a lot of States, as I

9

understand it.

10
11

Do any of them give the inmate immunity if

he participates in the program?
MR. McALLISTER:

Justice Stevens, it's my

12

understanding that some may, although I don't know the

13

exact number, and I do know from the State amicus brief

14

the 18 States that signed onto that obviously think

15

immunity is a bad idea and, as I said, the Federal

16

Government does not immunize the inmates who participate

17

in the Federal program.

QUESTION:

I understand the Federal Government

does not, yes.

20

MR. McALLISTER:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

Yes.

Of those, how many are like Kansas?

That is, it isn't a voluntary thing?
MR. McALLISTER:

Justice Ginsburg, I don't know

24

the answer to that. I don't know exactly what their

25

programs are like.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

9

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

10
11
12
13

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
QUESTION:

Mr. Garre, why does the Federal

Government not think it a good idea to grant immunity?
MR. GARRE:

Justice Scalia, the Federal

14

Government has a very limited program that applies in only

15

one facility Nation-wide, and it has made a determination

16

to allow for voluntary participation among convicted

17

sexual offenders in that program.

18

Now, in our view that is a judgment that this

19

Court's decisions clearly enable the Federal Bureau of

20

Prisons to make, and we think that the Kansas prison

21

officials have acted within their judgment to adopt a

22

different kind of program.

23

acknowledge, denial is one of the biggest obstacles to

24

receiving treatment in these kinds of programs, and I

25

think it's important for the Court to recognize --

As the therapists all

1

QUESTION: Are you going to get around the

2

answering my question?

3

think it not a good idea to grant immunity in its program?

4

MR. GARRE:

Why did the Federal Government

Oh, the Federal Government reserves

5

the right of the same confidentiality limits that the

6

State does, that is, to deal with offenses that threatens

7

institutional security, to deal with suspected cases of

8

child abuse, to deal with suspected cases of harm to

9

individuals within the prison or outside of the prisons.

10

Those confidentiality limits are clearly related to

11

legitimate penalogical interests, and we think that the

12

Federal Government --

13

QUESTION:

Only those things can be prosecuted?

14

I thought that it -- that prosecution was available for

15

anything that was disclosed, although there was

16

confidentiality.

17

MR. GARRE:

18

limits work in conjunction --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. GARRE:

22

QUESTION:

24
25

The confidentiality

Those are confidentiality limits, not

immunity limits, right?

21

23

That's right.

That's right.
So the Federal Government has not

given use immunity for anybody in the program.
MR. GARRE:

And that's absolutely clear from the

waiver of the confidentiality statement that inmates sign

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

before they enrol in the program, and we think that

2

particularly where you're dealing with a program that does

3

clearly promote legitimate penalogical interests in

4

rehabilitating a class of offenders that poses a unique

5

risk of recidivism upon their release, that States, the

6

mere fact that the State doesn't grant immunity to inmates

7

who participate does not provide an answer to the

8

constitutional problem.

9

QUESTION:

The Feds --

10

QUESTION:

Well, does the Federal Government

11

deprive the prisoner of any benefits or programs if he

12

refuses to engage in the program?

13

MR. GARRE:

The Federal Government doesn't apply

14

the same incentive schemes that the State of Kansas does

15

for participation.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Are there any?

What are the

incentives in the Federal program?
MR. GARRE:

The incentives -- the overriding

19

incentive is, of course, the value of the treatment that

20

the inmate receives.

21

QUESTION:

Now, once a -But not -- nothing is threatened or

22

carried out in the Federal program to deprive the

23

nonconsenting prisoner of any privilege, is that right?

24
25

MR. GARRE:

Well, that's true up front in terms

of the incentive scheme.

Now, once an inmate is in the

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

program, and if he chooses not to comply with the

2

acceptance of responsibility goals, the inmate can be

3

transferred back to his parent facility and that can be

4

something on its record, but certainly up front -QUESTION:

5

The choice to go into the program is

6

strictly the inmates.

7

He loses nothing if he chooses not to go in, is that

8

correct?

9
10

MR. GARRE:

There's no coercion or inducement.

That's the way the Federal Bureau of

Prisons --

11

QUESTION:

Is it a more desirable facility?

12

MR. GARRE:

It is at a more desirable facility.

13

QUESTION:

So what he loses is, he doesn't -- he

14

isn't -- he doesn't get out of the rotten place he's in to

15

a better facility, right?

16
17
18
19
20

MR. GARRE:

I think that's right, and I think

it's important -QUESTION:

But he doesn't lose a benefit that he

currently has?
MR. GARRE:

Well, we don't -- we think that the

21

privileges that we're talking about in the case of Kansas,

22

TV ownership, personal TV in the cell, visitation

23

privileges beyond immediate family, and lawyers, canteen

24

expenditures, these aren't the sorts of things --

25

QUESTION:

The right to work, the right to take

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

other programs in the prison?

2

MR. GARRE:

The privileges are reduced.

I think

3

that the chart that's on page 27 of the joint appendix

4

explains how they're reduced.

5

QUESTION:

Substantial reduction in how much you

6

can earn in prison, what jobs you can do in prison, isn't

7

that so?
MR. GARRE:

8
9

There is a definite reduction, and

the flip side of that is Kansas reserves the higher

10

privileges, the more modern facilities to those inmates

11

who choose to take the constructive steps towards

12

reentering society.

13

QUESTION:

Okay, but there's no --

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Garre --

15

QUESTION:

There's no reduction in the Federal

16

system, is that correct?
MR. GARRE:

17

There's no -- the Federal system

18

currently doesn't employ the same earnable privilege

19

scheme that the Kansas prison does.
QUESTION:

20

We're trying to be specific about it.

21

As I think we think we understand it, the inmate cannot

22

lose privileges that the inmate currently enjoys simply by

23

exercising the option not to enter the program.

24

correct?

25

MR. GARRE:

Are we

That's correct, except that the

Alderson Reporting Company

1

inmate can be sent back to his parent facility.
QUESTION:

2

Yes, but you have said -- you said in

3

your opening statement, and you seem to be backing away

4

from it, you said the Federal program is a voluntary

5

program.

6

MR. GARRE:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. GARRE:

10

12

It's not a voluntary program, at

least not for the people like --

9

11

As is --

Well --

QUESTION:

That's sort of the issue here, isn't

MR. GARRE:

With respect, we think that that is

it?

13

the issue.

I mean, we're not talking about losing

14

someone's job, or means of livelihood, the consequence

15

faced by free individuals in the penalty cases that

16

respondents relied upon.

17

institutional privileges that inmates have no expectation

18

of enjoying once they enter the prison.

19

prison context is key to evaluating the Fifth Amendment

20

claim in this case.

21

QUESTION:

We're talking about loss of

We think that the

Let me ask you this, Mr. Garre. Maybe

22

you can give me some help with the larger question that's

23

bothering me and I think underlies Justice Ginsburg's

first question.

in the Fifth Amendment context.
MR. GARRE:

2

Why is that?

Well, foremost because the Fifth

3

Amendment says, compelled self-incrimination.

4

amendment therefore recognizes that there are some sorts

5

of pressures or conditions short of compulsion which would

6

not meet the Fifth Amendment standard, and this Court's

7

cases -QUESTION:

8
9

meet it?

The

Anything short of compulsion does not

That is to say, you can have two classes of

10

inmates, those who've confessed and those who haven't, for

11

all of prison life?

12

MR. GARRE:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Well -And isn't there a danger, then, of

inducing innocent people to confess?
MR. GARRE:

I think that type of hypothetical is

16

much different, much further afield than the program in

17

this case.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Well, the Fifth Amendment doesn't say

inducing, does it, it says compelling.
MR. GARRE:

It says compelling, that's exactly

21

right, and that's supported by the text and history and

22

purpose of the amendment.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Garre, don't we in fact have two

24

classes in all prison systems, those who have pleaded

25

guilty and have gotten a relatively short sentence by

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reason of their guilty plea for a particular crime, and

2

those who have refused to plead guilty and have gotten a

3

longer sentence because of their refusal to do so, for the

4

same crime?

5

MR. GARRE:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. GARRE:

8

QUESTION:

9
10
11

That's -You have two classes in prison.
That's absolutely -I mean, not just not being able to

spend as much at the PX, but they're there for another 15
years.
MR. GARRE:

That's correct, and I think it's

12

important for the Court to recognize that these sorts of

13

earnable daily privileges like TV ownership, canteen

14

expenditures, and housing in preferred facilities are

15

among the most common tools the prison administrators use

16

to manage order in the prison environment and to encourage

17

inmates to take socially constructive steps.

18

cases like Sandin and Meachum and Bell v.Wolfish recognize

19

that once someone is lawfully incarcerated, that brings

20

about a necessary withdrawal of many rights and privileges

21

consistent with the needs of day-to-day management.

22
23

QUESTION:

This Court's

So is compulsion anything other than

physical, or psychological?

24

MR. GARRE:

25

QUESTION:

Oh, sure.

Sure.

So what would be -- I mean, in --

1

outside prison we know, at least this Court's precedent

2

has said losing your membership in the bar, losing your

3

job, that counts as compulsion, even though no one is

4

putting you on the rack and screw.

5

MR. GARRE:

And we think -- we agree with Judge

6

Friendly and others who have suggested that those cases

7

lie at the outer reaches of this Court's Fifth Amendment

8

jurisprudence, and we think that the denial of the sorts

9

of common, routine privileges at issue in this case, TV

10
11
12
13

privileges, canteen expenditures, don't even come close.
QUESTION:
privileges?

How about loss of visiting

That could be crucial to a prisoner.

MR. GARRE:

Well, it's not a complete loss of

this case.

Again, the chart on page 27 of the joint

appendix in the case that --

I mean, there are

17

some of these things that must mean all the difference in

the world to someone who's incarcerated.

19

MR. GARRE:

Well, I mean, the further the Court

20

goes out in that direction, then obviously at some point

21

That's quite different.
But under the State system they

And I expect the arsonist considers

12

that he least of his worries.

QUESTION:

When you say punishment, you assume

MR. WILTANGER:

5

I think the difference, Your

attorney in that this is not voluntary, and that once you

achieve a level -- the State has set up a structure, Your

uncharged crimes, we're taking that away from you.

But that's -- you know, either you do

MR. WILTANGER:

I don't -- Your Honor, our view

20

is not -- is that that is not compulsion, because what is

21

being extended to the murder suspect is a benefit, some

22

way to improve your lot.

23

In this situation, for example, if the State

24

wanted to -- what they're doing -- it's not Mr. Lile's

25

case, because he was convicted before 1995, but if you're

that the State of Kansas could do exactly what it's doing

7

now if it said, Mr. Wiltanger and all sexual offenders,

you go in at level 1 and you never get out of it unless

you take this program?

MR. WILTANGER:

Your Honor, I do think that's

certainly closer to the -- that would be closer to a

constitutional law.

you re doing, the whole program is fine. The only thing

2

is, you take this category of offender and you don t give

3

them anything until they take this program.

4

MR. WILTANGER:

If they could set up a system or

5

a structure or fashion some rules -- obviously, they don't

6

have that now -- I don't think that would be

7

unconstitutional.

8
9

Again, I do think there is -- if the Court
doesn't want to draw a hypertechnical distinction, that's

10

fine, but the Court -- the Fifth Amendment doesn't

11

prohibit benefiting somebody or making their life better.

12

QUESTION:

So you think the Sentencing

13

Guidelines would be invalid if, instead of the current

14

provision, which gives you good points for acceptance of

15

responsibility, it rather gave you bad points for refusing

16

to accept responsibility.

17

MR. WILTANGER:

I do, Your Honor.

I do.

18

QUESTION:

If that's so --

19

QUESTION:

It's a constitutional distinction.

20

MR. WILTANGER:

21

QUESTION:

I do believe so, Your Honor.

If that's so, does this case -- my

22

understanding of it is that the prison created a new

23

policy, and that policy was that everybody was at level 1

24

unless you participate in a recommended program, that that

25

was their new policy, but that your client was

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

grandfathered in at level 3 because he was in prison at

2

the time, and so this case in your opinion turns on the

3

fact that we're dealing with one of the few prisoners who

4

was grandfathered in, and therefore it's a taking away

5

rather than being a new prisoner who would have started at

6

level 1, in which case it would have been added on.

7

MR. WILTANGER:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. WILTANGER:

Not exactly, Your Honor.

Because?
Because all inmates -- there

10

were not just inmates at level 3 who were grandfathered

11

in.

12

get to level 3, and as opposing counsel -QUESTION:

13
14

Every single inmate who enters the prison system can

Even without participating in a

recommended program?

15

MR. WILTANGER:

16

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

But then they changed the rule and

17

said, if you don't participate in the recommended program,

18

you can't get to level 3.
MR. WILTANGER:

19

Is that right?
If -- they have not changed the

20

rule.

That is not the current rule.

The current rule

21

is -- and the way that SATP, or the sex offender treatment

22

is structured is, you don't really become eligible to take

23

it or forced to take it until about 2 years before your

24

first parole date, so by that time -- especially in Mr.

25

Lile's case.

He's been in prison for 15 years -- most

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

inmates are going to be at that level 3, so while he was

2

grandfathered in, most inmates, when they get eligible or

3

are forced to take it are going to be at level 3.

4

There has been no change in policy.

The State

5

is now not saying that you don't get from level 1 to level

6

2 unless you participate in SATP.

7

you're at level 3, you're going to level 1, and you're

8

going to go to maximum security, and you're going to stay

9

there forever.

10

The law still is, if

Again, the reference I was making at the first

13

they don't have the facility to give this course to

sexual offenders don't have the opportunity.

17

MR. WILTANGER:

Well, the State wants all --

wants their sex offenders to take it.

QUESTION:

2

But your brief described a system

3

where, suppose we had all sex offenders, they go in at

level 1 unless they take the program.

5

that doesn't exist in the current world only because of a

6

lack of resources, that Kansas can't give this program to

7

all the people who would qualify, so it concentrates on

8

the people who have served a substantial part of their

9

sentence already.
MR. WILTANGER:

10

That's something

That is correct, and please

11

understand, Your Honor, that that is only one possible

2

any expectation of receiving when he goes into prison.

3

could have been kept at level 1 for his whole period

4

there.
MR. WILTANGER:

5

He

Your Honor, I agree with that.

6

The one distinction I would make is, the State has set up

7

a system by which prisoners understand that if they do

8

certain things they get to levels.

9

a constitutional liberty interest in it, they do know that

While there may not be

10

if they follow the rules they're going to get to this

11

level.
But as far as addressing your first point,

12
13

immunity would be the result then.

14

everybody in the program, if there was no other option,

15

then you would extend them immunity, or the other solution

16

could be, if you wanted everyone in the program, don't

17

make them admit guilt to their crime.

18

catalogue every offense that they've never been charged

19

with.

20

ferret out and make sure that you've got every single past

21

crime.

If you had to have

QUESTION:

But that's a solution that isn't

consistent with the therapist's idea that this is how it

should be done.

25

MR. WILTANGER:

Potentially, Your Honor.

I

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

mean, the State has not always required a written

2

admission of responsibility.

3

past 10 years that they've required that.

correct, the therapists apparently believe that you have

5

to have an admission of responsibility.

it has to be a written statement where you fess everything

up.

this question -- the extent to which other States have

granted immunity to solve this problem?

3

approach, and I try to distinguish between what's the add-

on as a privilege and the subtraction as a penalty, now my

5

concern would be, I'm now facing a nightmare of varying

6

situations in prisons across the country, and varying

7

efforts to say what's the status quo in respect to a

8

particular prisoner, what is an add-on as opposed to a

9

subtraction, and the arguments are infinite.

Now, what

could you say that would relieve me of that concern?
MR. WILTANGER:

Well, first, Your Honor, if this

12

Court doesn't want to get drawn into a benefit versus a

13

punishment distinction, you don't have to follow that for

14

this rule.

15

brief, that there is -- that we feel there is a difference

16

between a benefit and a punishment.

17

That is the position that we mentioned in the

But I also don't think that there will be a rash

18

of litigation.

The Supreme Court law, obviously, as you

19

know, speaks to sanctions, speak to penalty, anything that

20

makes your indication of your Fifth Amendment rights

21

costly, and we've have that rule for quite sometime, and

22

certainly there have been cases that have come down since

23

then where you look at it and decide, well, is he being

24

penalized, so again I'm -- I apologize if I'm sticking to

25

a hypertechnical distinction, but I do believe that the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

law would not really complicate matters, and that there is

2

not going to be a rash of litigation where --

3

QUESTION:

Well, you didn't answer the question,

4

though, and I have the same problem Justice Breyer does.

5

I don't know that we can distinguish between a benefit and

6

a sanction. I don't know that that's a line that at the

7

end of the day is going to be a good line, so what other

8

line do you offer?

9

MR. WILTANGER:

Well, I do believe that

10

sanction -- or what you can look at is, you could look at

11

this Court's ruling as to what is a voluntary statement in

12

the Colman case, whether or not he's being able to make an

13

unconstrained choice.

14

QUESTION:

Now --

Why not look to what Sandin looked to

15

in -- true, not in the context of the Fifth Amendment, but

16

in another context, and that is whether you have been

17

deprived of in prison is beyond what is the normal

18

expectation of prison life.

19

MR. WILTANGER:

Your Honor, I think that does a

20

couple of things, and why we disagree with Sandin.

21

is, I think you're creating a new rule, whereas I think we

22

already have a fine rule that works in the Fifth Amendment

23

arena, and if we're concerned about applying a Fifth

24

Amendment rule in the prison system --

25

QUESTION:

One

No, no, we don't have a rule that

44
Alderson Reporting Company

He would have had no complaint

10

at all, so I don't think it's parallel to the out-of-

prison cases, so it seems to me we need a new rule for in-

12

prison cases.

13

We could have a rule that so long as you haven't

14

been deprived of a liberty to which you're entitled, there

15

has been no compulsion.

16

have to go that far.

17

uses, so long as what's been done to you doesn't go below

18

the normal expectation of prison life.

19

said, you either enter this program or you're going to be

20

in solitary for the rest of your 15 years, you know,

21

that's beyond the normal expectation of prison life.

22

what your client has suffered is not that, it seems to me.

23

That goes pretty far.

We don't

We could use a line that Sandin

MR. WILTANGER:

I mean, if they

But

Your Honor, I would agree with

24

you that Mr. Lile has no liberty interest at play here,

25

but I would also suggest that there is no liberty interest

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in an at-will employment.

This Court has previously found

2

that if you're an at-will employee, you have no protected

3

property or liberty interest, and yet in those cases like

4

the Gardner case and the Garrity case there has been found

5

a Fifth Amendment violation.

There certainly is no liberty interest in being

we still have a Fifth Amendment violation.

The other reason I think Sandin doesn't work,

19

Your Honor, is I do share some of the concern that was

20

previously expressed by some of the other justices, is

21

that there would seem to be no reason why the State

22

couldn't walk up and down the hall, or up and down the

23

cells with a note pad and suggest, well, what's your

crime, did you do it?

25

I'm not really concerned at whether

whether you did it, and oh, by the way, please let me know

2

everything else you've done.

3

QUESTION:

Okay, so we'll add to it, there has

4

to be -- and the State of Kansas is perfectly willing to

5

add to it, it has to be for a legitimate penalogical

6

purpose.

7

MR. WILTANGER:

And certainly I would agree with

8

what's previously said, that there could be a legitimate

9

penalogical purpose in confessing, in coming clean, and

10

that you will not be a model prisoner unless you take

11

responsibility for your crime, whether it be a sex offense

12

or whether it be a murder.

13

The other reason I think Sandin is not

14

applicable to this case, and should not be extended to

15

this case, is that this Court actually said in Sandin,

16

while you don't have a due process right in a particular

17

level of confinement, you do retain other protections such

18

as the First and the Eighth Amendment, that if we move

19

you, you get moved from one place to another, you still

20

may be able to bring a constitutional claim, and that's

21

what Mr. Lile's done.

22

proper indication of his Fifth Amendment rights, and he

23

has brought a lawsuit against the State.

24

following some of the dicta in Sandin.

He's been moved in response to a

if you extend it, why would it necessarily be limited to

the Fifth Amendment?

4

5

and suggest that that's --

QUESTION:

Why would Sandin,

Is it possible that a State, if it

That's -- you see, I was thinking

7

about that, and the trouble with analogies, if you get one

8

that's very close, you become uncertain again.

9

suppose that the actual analogy was, there is a treatment

I mean,

10

program, and the treatment program requires the prisoner

11

to be isolated and not get any mail and not write any

12

letters to the newspapers for a couple of months, and they

13

say as part of this -- and it's totally legitimate, and

14

they say as part of this legitimate treatment program that

15

you can't write your letter to the newspaper, that's part

16

of the treatment, and moreover, we'll give you a privilege

17

if you do it.

And now what happens is, they grandfather one

QUESTION:

2

Well, one difference, certainly

3

between the First Amendment and its cases and the Fifth

4

Amendment is that there is a compulsion requirement in

5

order to invoke the Fifth Amendment, where the First

6

Amendment doesn't have anything like that.
MR. WILTANGER:

7

I agree.

They are different.

8

They are different standards.

The only point that I was

9

trying to raise, Your Honor, is that I think Sandin is a

10

little bit of a dangerous --

QUESTION:

I suppose --

QUESTION:

That's what distinguishes the

13

detriment and the benefit.

14

it's a detriment.

15

say it shall be unlawful to bribe a witness to get him to

16

testify.

17

benefits and detriments, doesn't it?

19

The First -- Fifth Amendment doesn't

The Fifth Amendment draws the line between

MR. WILTANGER:

18

There's a compulsion, but then

It does, and that's again -- I'm

sorry.
QUESTION:

20

So the Kansas program would be

21

perfectly okay, in your estimation, if it provided that at

22

the end of 18 years of 20-year sentences, or 2 years

23

before the end of their sentence, all sex offenders shall

24

be reduced, all sex offenders shall be reduced to prison

25

level 1.

MR. WILTANGER:

2

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, I -- I'm --

Why not, because then -- then if they

3

choose to come in this program they will be getting the

4

benefit of going back up to 3, but all of them go down to

5

1.

6
7

MR. WILTANGER:

I don't think that would be

constitutional, Your Honor.

8

QUESTION:

Why not?

9

MR. WILTANGER:

I think it would be set up as a

10

way to get around SATP and a way to get around the

11

invocation of your Fifth Amendment rights.

12

QUESTION:

Well, any --

13

MR. WILTANGER:

14

QUESTION:

It would be an artifice.

Well, of course it's an artifice, but

15

so is the whole thing, benefit versus punishment.

16

mean -MR. WILTANGER:

17

I

The one thing I would encourage

18

this Court to look at is, look at how it affects itself on

19

the prisoner, and again, if you're going to look at the

20

Colman case, which is -- again, is his choice an

21

unconstrained one?

here.

The arsonist will not

be moved to maximum security.

Lile is there forever.

I would agree with

But unfortunately for Mr. Lile's case, it's not how

10

you follow the rules, you become a model prisoner, and

11

then you get broken down.

12

That's what they're doing here.

And again the point I was trying to make earlier

13

is, the punishment's more severe.

14

excuse me, the State calls this punishment.

You're saying to decide what is

years, no matter what the crime, there wouldn't be the

2

constitutional problem, but if only these people are, even

3

though it's written into the scheme the moment they go in,

4

there still would be a constitutional problem, and it's a

5

comparative treatment criterion among prisoners in

6

different classes of offenses that you're relying on,

7

isn't it?

8

MR. WILTANGER:

9

QUESTION:

10

Somewhat, Your Honor.

Yes.

MR. WILTANGER:

Somewhat, and I agree, if the

11

State had set up a strict --

12

QUESTION:

Then let me ask you to concentrate on

13

that question a little harder, because you did say in your

14

brief that if all sex offenders -- not all prisoners, all

15

sex offenders on day 1 were put in class 1, they could

16

stay there, and never get out unless the carrot that was

17

dangled was taken.

18

say all prisoners.

You did say sex offenders.

19

MR. WILTANGER:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

You didn't

That is correct.

So apparently you are not objecting

to a distinction between classes of prisoners.
MR. WILTANGER:

No, Your Honor, you're correct,

23

and again that's consistent with the view that we took

24

between the benefit and the sanction.

25

QUESTION:

So there isn't a comparative analysis

53
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

as between classes of prisoners depending on their

2

offense.

3

MR. WILTANGER:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. WILTANGER:

6

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, there isn't.

Okay.
I apologize if I misspoke.

Now, I understood you the other way.

7

That is, that you agree it would be an artifice, but if

8

the State did not knock down all sex offenders to level 1

9

2 years before they get out, then you acknowledge your

10

client wouldn't have a case.
MR. WILTANGER:

11

Essentially, yes, that is

12

correct.

Again, that is not what we have in place here,

13

but that is correct.

14

That is correct.

confidentiality, and also to point out, the State has not

2

appealed or contested that what it seeks is incriminating

3

information.

4

This information, the Fifth Amendment itself, is

5

far too valuable that the State can go around and force

6

people to give it up and to extract penalties and

7

punishment for that.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. McALLISTER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I'd like to start, Justice O'Connor, by

answering a question you raised.

18

recognize at some point it becomes compulsive, that this

19

Court has always treated the Fifth Amendment compulsion

inquiry as contextual.

prison that's a very different context from being on the

22

outside and losing a job or losing your law license.

23

Can the State simply

Absolutely not.

We're simply arguing that in

24

away everything from Mr. Lile, that maybe that would be

They're saying with the cohort of

they're all up to level 3, and then because he won't go in

11

the program, he alone is pushed back to level 1, and

that's a big change, and he says that's taking away --

MR. McALLISTER:

QUESTION:

MR. McALLISTER:

Yes, but I mean, in our view

there's an important penalogical reason for doing that,

and it doesn't rise to the level of compulsion because

we're in the prison setting.

QUESTION:

That's why we think Sandin

But why wouldn't the same penalogical

reason justify taking away all privileges?

beginning of your rebuttal?

MR. McALLISTER:

4

have been different.

5

too much.

6

QUESTION:

There is a line at which it becomes

No, but if he were put in solitary

7

confinement it would be justifiable, if at all, because of

8

a penalogical reason for the way he had behaved in prison,

9

creating dangerous conditions, et cetera.

Why isn't the

10

rehabilitation of sex offenders who, if unrehabilitated

11

will go out in the community and repeat their crimes, just

12

as important a penalogical reason, and why wouldn't it

13

justify taking away all privileges?

14

MR. McALLISTER:

Because the text of the Fifth

15

Amendment says no person shall be compelled, and the

16

question is compulsion, and at some point, if we took away

17

everything, or we make him work 20 hours a day or -- we

18

could do things to him that I think the Court would have

19

to say --

20

QUESTION:

No, but you're saying -- if I

21

understand your argument, you're saying, one reason why

22

you should not characterize this as compulsion is the

23

valid penalogical reason for doing it.

24

MR. McALLISTER:

25

QUESTION:

That's part of it.

And my suggestion is, if there -- if

57
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the State should say, look, the protection of these

2

victims on the outside, who are going to be preyed upon by

3

this person if not rehabilitated, is just as important as

4

preventing people from setting fires in their cells, and

5

therefore, if we take all privileges to the fire-setters,

6

we've got an equally good penalogical reason to take away

7

all privileges from the person who won't go into the

8

program.

9

MR. McALLISTER:

10

have potentially --

11

QUESTION:

12
13

And that I agree with.

We do

Then you could take away all the

privileges.
MR. McALLISTER:

Not all the privileges, because

14

it has to rise to the level of compulsion, and if they are

entitled to nothing in prison --

That's the question.

MR. McALLISTER:

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

20

MR. McALLISTER:

That's the question, and --

That's all right.

is the question, and again, the point that was drawn out

here on the distinction between --

QUESTION:

4

The distinction here between a loss of privilege

5

and the granting of a benefit in the State's view is

6

simply a semantic game.

inmate's perspective it just can't be any different, and

8

if the notion is what we should have done is, we should

9

all treat them as -- we should treat them all when they

There really -- I mean, from the

10

come in as poorly as we can as long as we satisfy

11

constitutional minimum, treat them as poorly as we can,

12

and then make them earn everything, if that's all it

13

takes, we can go back and do that, but that certainly

14

doesn't benefit inmates as a class, and it's certainly not

15

how prisons are run at this time in this country.

16

would be a vast shift in the way prisons are administered.

17

It

So that's really a semantic game, and the key

18

inquiry here is, are we compelling them, are we doing

19

something sufficiently substantial to these inmates to

20

override their will and really force them to make these

21

admissions, again which are in a treatment context, not to
