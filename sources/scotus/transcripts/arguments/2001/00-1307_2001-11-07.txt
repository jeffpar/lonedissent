ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R.Q. WOLFSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. WOLFSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Congress enacted the Coal Act to prevent the

12

collapse of a multi-employer, private health care system

13

that had promised health care benefits to retired coal

14

miners.

15

coal operators were selling their operations and

16

dissolving and going out of business and shifting

17

responsibility for their employees to other employers that

18

were in the multi-employer health care system.

19

Miners were in danger of losing their benefits as

Congress enacted the Coal Act to stop this

20

downward spiral.

21

miner's benefits would be the responsibility of the

22

operator that employed the miner, if possible, or if that

23

operator was defunct, with one of that operator's related

24

persons.

25

It wanted to ensure that a retired

this policy.

That section sets forth the related persons

2

who may be assigned responsibility for a miner's -- for an

3

operator's employees.

4

that statutory language in section 9701(c)(2), the

5

commissioner may assign a miner to the direct successor in

interest of a signatory operator.

Under a straightforward reading of

QUESTION:

Mr. Wolfson, even the dissenting

judge in the court of appeals didn't buy that.
MR. WOLFSON:

Well, it is true that he did not

11

agree with us, Mr. Chief Justice, that the plain text of

12

the statute did not support our reading, but I have to

13

respectfully disagree with the dissenting judge because it

is our position that it does.

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, there are two possible

3

approaches to this question, Justice O'Connor.

Certainly

4

one meaning of describe is to set out or to refer to, and

5

that is an established common usage of the meaning

describe.

true that the signatory operator is set out in and

8

expressed in each of the subclauses (1), (2), and (3).

9

But I would also submit -- and that is one theory under

It's a dictionary definition, and it's also

10

which we think that the plain text of the language

11

supports our position.

12

I would also submit, however, that even if

13

described has a more kind of -- a different sense,

14

nonetheless, a signatory operator may be found within

15

those -- those clauses (1), (2), and (3) because a

signatory operator is, by definition --

Mr. Wolfson, can I interrupt you for

insofar as it refers to any of the -- any of the entities

So that the only meaning that can

logically be given to the word described in the context of

this statute is the one you give to it.

10

MR. WOLFSON:

That is -- that is our position,

Justice Stevens.

12

QUESTION:

You think there's no -- no difference

13

between a provision which says a member of the controlled

group of corporations which includes the signatory

operation, or a more detailed description, any other

person who is identified as having a partnership interest

Justice Scalia --

In the prologue.

A person shall be

22

considered to be a related person to a signatory operator

And you say signatory operator is one of the persons

QUESTION:

I want to be very precise here

2

because it's not necessary to refer to the prologue.

3

After all, the -- the end, the flush paragraph says a

4

related person shall also include a successor in interest

5

of any person described in the clauses, not described in

6

the prologue.

So, our -- so, it's not necessary to go to

7

the prologue.

All that is necessary is to go to the

8

clauses.

9
10

And a signatory operator -- first of all, it is
literally described and set forth in those clauses.

11

Second, it is -- a signatory operator is a

12

member of a family that includes a signatory operator.

13

that sense, even in a broader sense or a different sense

14

of described, it is -- (A) is a member of the group that

Now, even if -- I think that I can concede that

the contrary reading is a permissible one of the statute

even if picking up the statute and -- and reading it for

19

the first time without any reference to the context of the

20

Coal Act.

21

But -QUESTION:

And it is -- as I understand it,

22

there hasn't been any court that has accepted your reading

23

so that courts, whether the person was writing in dissent

24

or in the majority, have rejected your reading as an

25

impermissible one.

Am I right about that?

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, they -- they, in the end,

2

agreed with us that that -- Judge Murnaghan below and the

3

D.C. Circuit in the R.G. Johnson case agreed with us in

4

the end that the statute should be given this meaning

because --

QUESTION:

But not on the basis of what the text

7

says.

In both cases they said Congress could not have

8

meant what they wrote, but as to the literal

9

interpretation of the statute, they all agreed -- they all

10

rejected the notion that Congress had, in fact, enumerated

11

a successor of a signatory as -- within the -- the text of

12

the statute.

13

MR. WOLFSON:

14

Now, it's our position, though, we disagree with

15

those holdings, and we -- and it's our position that it is

16

at minimum a permissible reading of the statute.

QUESTION:

That is correct.

Do you know any other statute that's

18

ever been interpreted that way where it, you know,

describes certain people --

QUESTION:

And

I'm more likely to think that

Congress meant what it says, and -- and I -- why do you

assert that it is -- it is unbelievable that Congress

would have meant what it said here?

10

It is certainly the case that the -- that the

11

persons who would have been most affected by the

12

interpretation of this language that you -- you -- that

13

you propose would have been the very coal mine operators

14

who were lobbying Congress to get this thing passed.

15

seems to me not at all inexplicable that they were willing

16

to have successors in interest of other people down the

17

line held liable so long as they themselves would not be

18

regarded as the successor in interest to somebody who

preceded them, you know, saddling them with liability.

we should address it in -- in some of the bills in

predecessor sessions of -- of the Congress in which they

12

specifically did include successors to the signatories.

13

So that it seems, if -- if you want to look at the -- the

broader record on what's believable and what isn't

And the entire Coal Commission which was in

12

its commitments to its retirees and dump liability on the

funds disrupts any effective long-range solution, and then

there is some further language, and then it says, the

There is no disagreement on that as being the --

that these other people, these successors of related

which I have to say is -- I'm not aware that the Court has

MR. WOLFSON:

that we lose on the plain language of the statute.

But to the contrary I would say Congress must

that Congress would not also include the large group who

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER BUSCEMI

21

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED MINE WORKERS OF AMERICA

COMBINED BENEFIT FUND, AS AMICUS CURIAE

23

MR. BUSCEMI:

24
25

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
There are several things that are not in dispute

1

in this case, and I think it's worth reminding the Court

2

of some of what they are.

3

First of all, Congress did not say that the

4

successors of signatory operators are excluded from

5

liability.

6

Congress could have said that.

It did not.

Secondly, Congress did seek to assign as many

7

Combined Fund beneficiaries as possible to specific

8

signatory operators, and to keep the unassigned

9

beneficiaries to an absolute minimum.

10

Thirdly, as Mr. Wolfson said, the coal industry

11

was characterized by shifting forms of corporate

12

organization.

13

Congress was trying to address, that you had miner --

14

mining companies selling assets, other mining companies

15

coming in apparently indistinguishable to the outside

16

observer.

17

there were the same.

18

yet, the company that did own the assets at one time

19

sought to walk away, and the other -- and the company

20

coming in said, well, I'm not responsible.

21

This was one of the very problems that

The mine looked the same.

The people working

The equipment was the same.

And

Fourthly, the statute includes very broad

22

provisions defining related person, far broader than the

23

ordinary circumstances in which parent and subsidiary

24

liability for each other's debts or obligations would be

25

found.

1

And finally, also undisputed is that it's not

2

only that the successors in interest of related persons

3

are liable for the Combined Fund obligations, but it's

4

also that the successors in interest of the signatory

5

operators themselves are liable for the individual

6

employer plans, section 9711, which involved very

7

substantial obligations, and for the '92 plan.

8

that is undisputed.

9

QUESTION:

10

All of

How -- how do we know that?

MR. BUSCEMI:

9711(g)(1) explicitly says that

11

successors in interest to signatory operators are liable

12

for the individual employer plans and for the '92 plan.

13

QUESTION:

I'm not sure that helps you.

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

15

MR. BUSCEMI:

Why doesn't it cut against you?

Well, I -- well, I readily

16

acknowledge that you can make both arguments, but I think

17

the better argument is that it helps us because it adds to

18

the incongruity that our opponents are trying to argue for

19

here.

20

Congress wanted to make successors in interest of related

21

persons liable for the Combined Fund.

22

successors in interest to the signatory operators liable

23

for the individual employer plan and for the '92 plan.

24

And yet, Congress wanted to carve out a little segment

25

there for signatory -- successors of signatory operators

It adds to the oddity of the result.

It says that

It wanted to make

and the Combined Fund.
QUESTION:

But it's not a little segment because

3

if your opponent is right, everybody would have a motive

to sell out right away.

from your opponent's reading of the statute.

7

MR. BUSCEMI:

QUESTION:

10

So, it would seem to me the whole

Well --

Everybody should have just sold out

right away.
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, precisely, Your Honor.

I

11

mean, one of the things that I -- I'd like to point out is

12

that one of the enormous anomalies of what our opponents

13

are arguing and what the court of appeals has held here is

14

that it essentially says that Congress deliberately put

15

into the statute the seeds of the statute's demise.

16

Congress created a situation in which anyone who was -- on

17

whom liability was imposed under this statute could sell

18

its asset to someone else, distribute the proceeds to its

19

shareholders, dissolve the corporation, and the -- and the

20

obligations would be terminated, and yet the operations of

21

the coal mine would continue on as is.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Buscemi?

23

QUESTION:

But the answer to that --

24

QUESTION:

I don't follow that because isn't it

3

liability up to the amount that they gained from the asset

5

Isn't that just standard corporate law?
MR. BUSCEMI:

Well, I suspect, Your Honor, that

6

the argument would be made that that's also not in the

statute and that, therefore, you can't import that into

8

the statute.

9

this is a potential result of the argument that's been

No one has denied -- when we've said that

MR. BUSCEMI:

The standard provision for a

not be displaced.

18

argument that nor should the successorship preexisting law

19

be displaced; that is, Congress acted against the

20

background of preexisting law, both judicial

interpretation of the statute and the normal rules of

But I could respond to that with the

and I think that's all the commissioner has done here.

7

The -- the fact of the matter is if -- if we

want to do an absolute, literal reading of the language, I

think that the signatory operators are included there.

10

think what the -- our opponents are doing is they're

saying we want it one way because we want the natural

reading, but we don't want the really absolutely literal

QUESTION:

Going back to your argument that the

corporations that are, in effect, going to -- probably

isn't that the reason why the inducement that you refer to

MR. BUSCEMI:

QUESTION:

Not this text, that's correct.

Let me just go one step further than

Justice Scalia's question and -- and ask you this.

12

take it it's -- it's correct that at no time in this

13

litigation has your side either represented to the court

14

or tried to offer any evidence to any court that this was

15

the result of a -- in effect, a deliberate political

16

agreement.

17

you'll take that out kind of a agreement.

18

I -- I

You know, we'll withdraw our opposition if

MR. WOODRUM:

No.

We've not taken the position

19

that there was a -- a -- some sort of a tradeoff of taking

20

it out of the one section and yet leaving it in the other.

21

QUESTION:

Then that really does leave it as

MR. WOODRUM:

That's a real

The -- the problem is that -- and

13

that's why the courts tend to enforce the plain language

14

of the statute as written is because we don't know what

15

happens in those discussions, in those negotiations that

16

lead to the enactment.

17

QUESTION:

You're -- you're not saying, are you,

18

that you know for a fact that there was not this -- this

there is legislative history that to me strongly suggests

there was no such political deal.

Wallop and Senator Rockefeller get up and they say this

5

whenever one Senator says such a thing and that's actually

So -- so, I would say

Well, let me explain each of those

First of all, Senator Rockefeller put some

13

comments into the record on many different points, and so

14

far there have been three circuit courts that have

15

declined to attribute or -- or to give plain language the

meaning that -- that Senator Rockefeller said it should

17

have on three other issues, in addition to this particular

issue.

Those cases are noted in -- in our brief.
Secondly, as far as Senator Wallop's comment is

20

concerned, it appears that it was simply added in as a

technical explanation.

I agree.

I'm just saying that the

2

D.C. -- the District of Columbia Circuit several months

3

ago in the case of Williams Mountain did define that term

4

to -- they didn't give it a specific definition, but they

5

said it's somewhere between a tax code successor and the

Black's Law Dictionary common law successor, which does

not include asset purchasers.

8

QUESTION:

9

But, Mr. Woodrum, it seems to me you

cannot fairly have it both ways.

You can either concede

10

that a successor within the meaning of this act includes

11

an asset purchaser and then make the argument that using

12

the dictionary act wouldn't -- wouldn't produce a sensible

statute anyway because, under the dictionary act,

successor would not normally be interpreted to include an

that under this legislation, successor does include an

This is not a concept

Except that it deals with successor

liability in a way that you've been unable to explain

MR. WOODRUM:

It -- the statute does not impose

liability on successors.

MR. WOODRUM:

No, sir.

It -- it speaks to

MR. WOODRUM:

Well, typically if you look at the

2

Black's Law Dictionary or the common law application of

3

successor in interest, it is statutory succession, merger,

name change successors, and so forth.

5

point in time, the commissioner even had adopted that

And in fact, at one

I see, but granting that -- assume it

plausible scenario is that we have 50 years of

QUESTION:

But if I understand the definition of

related persons, it could cover people not even in the

9

MR. WOODRUM:

It does, but the thing about that

definition is and the reason it has some logic to

11

expanding liability is it does encompass entities that

have an economic connection with the employer.

MR. WOODRUM:

The -- the jurisprudence of this

Court is that the language of the statute controls when

it's clear.

intended otherwise.

Even if it's perfectly clear Congress

MR. WOODRUM:

Yes.

It would make it perfectly clear to

(Laughter.)

8

MR. WOODRUM:

9
10

Exactly.

It -- it makes -- it makes for a

-- a rational jurisprudence when one tends to enforce the
-- the language that's actually in the statute.

11

And let me point out that what we're talking

12

about here is retroactive liability.

13

grounded in transactions that occurred decades before

14

enactment of this act.

15

QUESTION:

This liability is

That's what makes it so anomalous to

impose successor liability on successors of related

industry.

within the statute, and then it does not include people

who are still in the coal business.

That's what -- the troubling thing to me is the

MR. WOODRUM:

But if -- but if that question

23

comes to the Court, the Court will have to deal with that

24

question as to whether that is liability that may be

enforced and imposed on such distantly related entities

for historic transactions under the same criteria that the

2

Court used, for example, in the Eastern Enterprises case.

3

QUESTION:

Of course, these people were distant

4

not only from the transactions in question but also from

5

the negotiations that produced the statute.

6

MR. WOODRUM:

7

QUESTION:

8
9

Exactly.

And -- and that may well be the

explanation of why they got stuck.
MR. WOODRUM:

Yes, if they weren't there to

10

represent their interests, then -- and they likely weren't

11

since, I don't think, anybody that is that distant --

12

distantly related would have even been aware that there

13

was a problem in funding benefits.

14

But to -- to reflect back on the question of

15

sort of the clear language and this Court's view of how

16

clear Congress must be in enacting these statutes, as the

17

Court said in Lansgraf, since the early days of this

18

Court, we have declined to give retro effect --

19

retroactive effect to statutes burdening private rights

20

unless Congress made clear its intent.

21

intent assures that Congress itself has affirmatively

22

considered the potential unfairness of retroactive

23

application and determined that it is an acceptable price

24

to pay for the countervailing benefits.

and we should be looking for a very clear expression of

2

congressional intent to assign it to successors or

3

successor in interest before the commissioner may, in

4

effect, impose large, what are now administrative

5

obligations --

6

QUESTION:

But, of course, here there's no doubt

7

about the fact that whoever is covered -- it was intended

8

to be -- the statute was intended to have retroactive

effect.

10

MR. WOODRUM:

11

QUESTION:

12
13
14
15

Yes.

Which is, of course, what Lansgraf

was -MR. WOODRUM:

It is -- it is retroactive to

everyone that is covered.
The final point is that if this language is

16

enforced as written, the benefits are going to be provided

17

to the Shackleford beneficiaries on a pro rata basis by

18

all the operators who are assigned liability, including

19

Jericol, to the extent it otherwise has valid liability

benefits --

MR. WOODRUM:

Yes, Your Honor.

That -- there

has never been a call on the assigned operators to pay any

pro rata premium towards the payment of unassigned

beneficiaries' health care.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. WOLFSON:

22

Very briefly.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
The purpose of section 9701(c)(2)

23

was to reach the signatory operators and the broad group

24

of persons that were related to them by successorship and

25

by the related concept.

And it did that specifically

because Congress did not want to go to the Abandoned Mine

Fund or to a pro rata exaction on the other signatory

operators unless that was necessary as a last resort.
